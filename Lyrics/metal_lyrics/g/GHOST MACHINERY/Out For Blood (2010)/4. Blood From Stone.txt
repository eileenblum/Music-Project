[Music &amp; Lyrics: Pete Ahonen]

Walking in pins and needles
Begging for mercy out in the cold
Unleashing the inner feelings
I do not fit in this pre-made mould
The system will fall down so hard

Feels like a Blood from Stone
Riding in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light

Chasing shadows from within
Who's counting my mistakes
Match the profile like a second skin
The answers sound so vague
The system will fall down so hard

Feels like a Blood from Stone
Riding in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light

Blood from Stone
Running in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light

No need to spit on my face although we walk the parallel lives
The truth comes out and put you in place, the silence speaks so loud

[Solo]

Feels like a Blood from Stone
Riding in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light

Blood from Stone
Running in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light

Feels like a Blood from Stone
Riding in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light

Blood from Stone
Running in the dark, with a blindfold
Blood from Stone
Escaping from the light
