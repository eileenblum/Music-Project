[Blackfoot Cover]
[Music &amp; Lyrics: Ken Hensley &amp; Henry Williams]

Every night I hit the street
All alone burning with the need
Broken dreams and an empty heart have got me
I need a lover with a lot of heart
It's so hard when you're in the dark
And no one's there to help you find your way

I keep running in the night
Searching for the light
Crying for someone to rescue me

Won't you send me, send me an angel
Send me, send me an angel
Send me an angel tonight, tonight

Keep looking but I can't see
Listen hard but I don't believe
Is this the way it really has to be?
Say you're in or count me out
I can't live with all this doubt
Save my life with a single word

And I'm out here in the dark
I don't know where to start
Begging for my feelings to be heard

Won't you send me, send me an angel
Send me, send me an angel
Send me an angel tonight, tonight

[Solo]

I keep running in the night
Searching for the light
Crying for someone to rescue me

Won't you send me, send me an angel
Send me, send me an angel
Send me an angel tonight, tonight

Oh send
Won't you send me, send me an angel
Send me, send me an angel
Send me, send me an angel
An angel, an angel
