[Music: Pete Ahonen, Lyrics: Pete Ahonen &amp; Taage Laiho]

So sick and tired of your accusations
No matter how, where or when
Week after week, day in day out in ovation
Just waiting for you to send

One-way ticket to my hell
Hands out, kneel down and repent

Sacrificed for the times that I lived
Crucified for those times
Guilty!
Accused by you unknown fool, throw the stone
No need to hide, I make the rules
Guilty!

Your speak in silence stops the world from turning
No matter who, what or why
Your lame excuses won't stop my soul from burning
What justifies your wicked lies

One-way ticket to my hell
Hands out, kneel down and repent

Sacrificed for the times that I lived
Crucified for those times
Guilty!
Accused by you unknown fool, throw the stone
No need to hide, I make the rules
Guilty!

Sacrificed for the times that I lived
Crucified for those times
Guilty!
Accused by you unknown fool, throw the stone
No need to hide, I make the rules
Guilty!

[Solo]

One-way ticket to my hell
Hands out, kneel down and repent

Sacrificed for the times that I lived
Crucified for those times
Guilty!
Accused by you unknown fool, throw the stone
No need to hide, I make the rules
Guilty!

Sacrificed for the times that I lived
Crucified for those times
Guilty!
Accused by you unknown fool, throw the stone
No need to hide, I make the rules
Guilty!
