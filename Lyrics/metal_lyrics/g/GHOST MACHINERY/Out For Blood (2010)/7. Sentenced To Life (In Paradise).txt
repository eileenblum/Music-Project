[Music: Pete Ahonen, Lyrics: Pete Ahonen &amp; Taage Laiho]

Counting hours to the time to be free
Strength in numbers I have this kingdom to keep

Reign in hell or be a servant in heaven
To me it's so crystal clear

Sentenced to life in paradise
This world is build upon the secrets and lies
Sentenced to life in paradise
No need to pray, my blood is cold
My blood is cold as ice

My power justifies me to rule
Final hour for the heroic fool

Reign in hell or be a servant in heaven
To me it's so crystal clear

Sentenced to life in paradise
This world is build upon the secrets and lies
Sentenced to life in paradise
No need to pray, my blood is cold
My blood is cold as ice

[Solo]

Reign in hell or be a servant in heaven
To me it's so crystal clear

Sentenced to life in paradise
This world is build upon the secrets and lies
Sentenced to life in paradise
No need to pray, my blood is cold

Sentenced to life in paradise
This world is build upon the secrets and lies
Sentenced to life in paradise
No need to pray, my blood is cold
My blood is cold as ice
