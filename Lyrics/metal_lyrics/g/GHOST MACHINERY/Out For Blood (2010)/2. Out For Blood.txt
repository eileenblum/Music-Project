[Music: Pete Ahonen, Lyrics: Pete Ahonen &amp; Taage Laiho]


All is said but it still sounds hollow
Do you think that you're done?
Infected being the bringer of sorrow
Your life is under my gun

Lurking in corners hiding from light
Just beneath the surface of conscience
Lackeys of darkness bow to the beast
In the faith they are the justice

Out for Blood
It's said and done
I'm only in this for the kill
Out for Blood
All's said and done
Unleash the beast from within

Do you think escaping the trouble
Makes them disappear?
It will follow like a shadow
Like a dark child who fear

Lurking in corners hiding from light
Just beneath the surface of conscience
Lackeys of darkness bow to the beast
In the faith they are the justice

Out for Blood
It's said and done
I'm only in this for the kill
Out for Blood
All's said and done
Unleash the beast from within

Vengeance is my name and I just played the game
I played the leading role but I'm not going down alone

[Solo]

Out for Blood
It's said and done
I'm only in this for the kill
Out for Blood
All's said and done
Unleash the beast from within

Out for Blood
It's said and done
I'm only in this for the kill
Out for Blood
All's said and done
Unleash the beast from within
