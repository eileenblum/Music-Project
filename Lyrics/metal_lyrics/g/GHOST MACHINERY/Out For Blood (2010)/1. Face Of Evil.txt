[Music &amp; Lyrics: Pete Ahonen]

It all looked good and I was mesmerized
I threw a caution in the wind
I was overlooked and I was sacrificed
My body's drowning in the sin

You can count on me
Things will never be the same
Own enemy in this fool's game

I saw your true Face of Evil
It's a clichÃ© but it was calm before the storm
You showed your true Face of Evil
It's a sin, consider yourself to be warned

Don't crush the bones you want them pulverized
But you're way too weak to stand your ground
You act so hurt, you act so victimized
You throw a bone to a poor to eat

You can count on me
Things will never be the same
Own enemy in this fool's game

I saw your true Face of Evil
It's a clichÃ© but it was calm before the storm
You showed your true Face of Evil
It's a sin, consider yourself to be warned

[Solo]

You can count on me
Things will never be the same
Own enemy in this fool's game

I saw your true Face of Evil
It's a clichÃ© but it was calm before the storm
You showed your true Face of Evil
It's a sin, consider yourself to be warned

I saw your true Face of Evil
It's a clichÃ© but it was calm before the storm
You showed your true Face of Evil
It's a sin, consider yourself to be warned
