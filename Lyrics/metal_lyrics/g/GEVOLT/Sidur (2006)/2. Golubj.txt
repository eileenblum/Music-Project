Have i had a dream...
shall i have a dream...
of a tender dove
of a bluish dove
: : :
It is pecking grain
so amusingly
cooing quietly
striking with a wing
: : :
But in a closer look
when you reach to look
it is cripple dove -
just one leg it has
: : :
It is hoping round
hoping round and round
for a tiny core
for a poppy see
