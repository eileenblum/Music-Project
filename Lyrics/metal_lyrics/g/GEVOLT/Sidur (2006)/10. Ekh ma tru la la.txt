i have stared and stared and staredTill my eyes fell down to dustNow i'm walking with no eyesOp pa, la-la, op pa: : :Hey, ho tra-la-lu!it all may be without me too!Hey, ho tra-la-lu!it all may be without me too!: : :I have walked and walked and walkedTill i fell and crooked and diedWould i better run like dumb?Smiling, blinking on a sun?: : :Hey, ho tra-la-lu!it all may be without me too!Hey, ho tra-la-lu!it all may be without me too!: : :I have sweat and sweat and sweatTill some gossips heard of meGathered round me like clownsClap their hands in dignity: : :Hey, ho tra-la-lu!it all may be without me too!Hey, ho tra-la-lu!it all may be without me too!
