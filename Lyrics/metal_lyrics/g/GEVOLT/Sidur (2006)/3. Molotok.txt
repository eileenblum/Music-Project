Air chilling down
to greedy soil
dusted bushes grow
up to moonlight's cold
night falling down
on these dim woods
where foliate might
whirling from the sky
: : :
Arachnid's dream
running into wilds -
thin fiber's fly
in the leady clouds
berries of stars
holes of the snags
shank has grown and grown -
soil is what we got
: : :
Oh, how your hammer
clanging in a dark
give me the shine
of your snaky hands
give me the cold
of your diamond eyes
the turbid thunder
of your heart
: : :
Uncolored smoke
floating on the soil
straight upon the ground
from the water ... crooked
arachnid dream
running into wilds -
thin fiber's fly
in the leady clouds
: : :
Lake waiting for
circle of flames
quiet water-flows
will wash out the web
whispering soil
in the dreamy haze
watching the moon
by arachnid's gaze
: : :
Oh, how your hammer
clanging in a dark
give me the shine
of your snaky hands
give me the cold
of your diamond eyes
the turbid thunder
of your heart
: : :
Lake waiting for
circle of flames
quiet water-flows
will wash out the web
uncolored smoke
floating on the soil
straight upon the ground
from the water ... crooked
: : :
Arachnid's dream
running into wilds -
thin fiber's fly
in the leady clouds
whispering soil
in the dreamy haze
watching the moon
by arachnid's gaze
: : :
Oh, how your hammer
clanging in a dark
give me the shine
of your snaky hands
give me the cold
of your diamond eyes
the turbid thunder
of your heart
: : :
Bless me
to this battle of will
crash me down
with your mighty heel
oh, how your voice
clanging in my will
i am reflected
in the mirrors of fate
