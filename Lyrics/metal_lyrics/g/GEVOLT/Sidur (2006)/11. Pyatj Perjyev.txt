[Five Feathers]

Open your windows wide,
Open your doors wide,
A bird descends from the skies,
A dove descends from the skies.

Sit on my shoulders, dove,
Sit on my arms, dove,
Whisper to me, dark bird,
I'll give you a crust of bread.

Grant me five of your feathers,
Grant me the shine of your eyes,
Embrace me tight, dove,
And rise with me above the skies!

Above the moon crescent, above the sun,
Above the stars on the crystal throne
We will sit with you, Queen,
We will glance in the mirror of the sea...

Ansuz - Uruz - Jera - Ansuz

Lock your doors tight,
Lock your windows tight,
Everything will be fine henceforth,
Now everything will be wonderful !

Ansuz - Uruz - Jera - Ansuz
