By the ocean, by the sea
stands an isle ... a rowdy
on that island ... altar stone
up there - Lad sits on his own
: : :
Knows no boredom
knows no sorrow
holds his eyes open
from dusk into tomorrow
: : :
Mouth full of teeth
spits out a fire
burns up the armies
of devilish desire
: : :
Keeps order and peace
through all the spaces
everyone knows him
everybody praises
