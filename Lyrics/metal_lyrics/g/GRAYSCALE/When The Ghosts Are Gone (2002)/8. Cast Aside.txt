Once again
I blew it all
Just to feel that pain
That makes me come alive
Pushed you away
As if I didn't care
Cast the whole world
Aside... My mind

And nothing feels real anymore
Not even this misery
Nothing feels real anymore

Once again
The boredom came
I had it all
I threw it all away
Drowned myself into the
Glass from which I drank
Drove myself to the edge
And pushed down

And nothing feels real anymore
Not even this misery
Nothing feels real anymore
Not even this misery

Cast aside
