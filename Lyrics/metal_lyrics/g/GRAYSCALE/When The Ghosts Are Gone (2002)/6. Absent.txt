Those eyes
their empty look
that hides
what's inside

Absent eyes
Once so bright
where have they
lost their shine

Where is your laughter
who ever killed your smile
nothing much is left but
desperate screams and cries

And that shadow
of what used to be
it's all changed now
it's all gone now
Day after day it's same
awakening in an empty room
inside these walls
that isolate from it all
pale as ice
terrified
Behind those blurry eyes
love turns to hate and dies
as I watch the fading figure
I don't know anymore
I feel disgust and fear
when it looks me back
from the mirror
