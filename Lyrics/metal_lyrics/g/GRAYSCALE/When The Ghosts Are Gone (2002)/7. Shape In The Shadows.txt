I watch the sunset
The sky that is turning red
One more day has passed
But The pain just grows

I Watch this world
The way I ever did before
Looking for something pure
But it's all gone

I shiver
I fear
This sorrow's more
Than I can bear

I see your shape in every shadow
I hear your voice when the wind blows
When the wind blows

I cannot find a reason
I cannot find a meaning
All that is left is
This dark despair

Dark clouds in the sky
Lower than ever before
It's hard to see anymore
My world has turned black
