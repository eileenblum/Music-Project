As I watch this chaos
that we live in
It leaves me cold
my soul has turned numb
Life seems just a dream
on my way 'til death
A trip through illusions
inside chaotic mind

..and something tears me apart
that something inside
Squeezing my heart
that cold hand
Beyond this world
that cold hand
Squeezing my heart
day after day
night after night
squeezing my heart

Where I feel alive
I can never stay
always pulled back
to see another day
With no meaning at all
the time crawls
Awaken as if asleep
alive, still dead inside

I cannot move
I cannot breath
the flame is fading
inside me
