The silence shouts
the silence shouts your name
again and again
emptiness
replies
it's always the same

and I know I will never find
what I once left behind
and I know I can't turn back time
it's all left behind now

One thousands screams
one thousands cries
the silence breaks
emptiness
remains
that will never change
