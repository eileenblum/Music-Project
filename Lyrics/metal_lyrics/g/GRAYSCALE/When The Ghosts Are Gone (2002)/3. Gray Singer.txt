They loved it's beauty
that I couldn't see
Loved those songs I thought were full of grief
let me out, asked it's eyes
let me out I'm dying
let me out of this cage
at least for one time

Without hope
Without freedom
there is no life

One day the singing stopped
and a silence fell
they wondered what could be wrong
but it couldn't tell
let me out, asked it's eyes
let me out I'm dying
let me out of this cage
at least for one time
