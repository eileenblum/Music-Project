black, and acoloured scene behind
black, are my eyes shut or black
a collapsed reality out of my numb mind
boundless dark or a locked self
my life is passing by
memoirs of decay
lost on the stage
like scenes of a play
a tragedy standing still
or forgotten under years of dust
I imagine to see, but my sight is asleep
my brain is not
there is so much pain
I can hear what I breathe
not air but some speech
a funeral echo far away
yet some creatures are here
on my unseen skin, consuming my hands
they are devouring me, they are devouring me
devouring me
words fade away
they are blessing my soul
I can feel something cold
not fear, my blood
I imagine to see, but my sight is asleep
my brain is not
there is so much pain
I can hear what I breathe
not air but some speech
a funeral echo far away
yet some creatures are here
on my unseen skin, consuming my hands
they are devouring me, they are devouring me
devouring me
boundless dark in my inner self
my life is passing by
the blackest silk, crawling worms
this is my coffin I am dead
