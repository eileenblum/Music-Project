Hold into your tenderness
you are the keeper Of knowledge
Life you generate from the blindest abyss
Fertile is your womb, to feed our numb minds
Fury of the cycles, Goddess of all nature
Isis, I evoke thee to be ceased
Snakerecoiled in chaos
Darkness you cast upon mankind
Into your sacred coils you hold my lost body
Fury of the dark side, Goddess of all chaos
Apophis, push my soul beyond
The thresholds
Sublime infinite thresholds
Hope, hate, perfection
Death is a step ahead
Renewed on my knees
Here am I raising purified flesh
Who walked unaffected
through the realm of death
Fury of rebirth, Goddess of purification
I evoke thee to be reborn
Osiris, push my soul beyond
The thresholds
Sublime infinite thresholds
Hope, hate, perfection
Death is a higher step
In the darkest dawn
Let me see into your chalice
Let me read your dreams
Your dreams, my nightmares
