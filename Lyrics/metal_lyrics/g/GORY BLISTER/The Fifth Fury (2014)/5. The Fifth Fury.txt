All the Furies: Birthed out of Uranos blood
We are the furies of anger, murder and vengeance

First Fury (Tisiphone): I come to scourge the guilty
The living and the dead, scorpions are by my side
I scent life and death
All the Furies: We are the daughters of the night
Second Fury (Megaera): So dreadful am I, snake-haired and jealous
I will strike you with madness
Third Fury (Alecto): My blood-dripping eyes fall on you,
am I the avenger of the slaughtered lambs
Fifth Fury: To my commands obey now, Erynies, ministers of pain
Zeus generated me and released me as a hound of hell

When I was born, the day had to die
Iâm the Fury from the dark side
Donât wait for a dawn, donât call for light
Worship a sun that will never rise
Fourth Fury (Nemesis): I come to scourge you dog!
Iâm the goddess of reward, Erynies are by my side
I judge life and death
All the Furies: We are the daughters of the night
Fifth Fury: I scorn human and divine retribution
Nemesis: the hourglass of human kind is in my hands
am I here to punish your insolent hubris
Fifth Fury: To my commands obey now, Erynies, ministers of pain
Zeus generated me and released me as a hound of hell

When I was born, the day had to die
Iâm the Fury from the dark side
Donât wait for a dawn, donât call for light
Worship a sun that will never rise
All the Furies: We are the daughters of the night
We are the ministers of pain
