I could see the moon, back from the war
Spots of blood on her pale dress
Dreams and tales be told no more
By the sad unfortunate witness
write what you saw, bloodstained sister
In the sky for future nightmares
my corpse has been raped twice
And thrown down in this hole
among the others
the seed of brainsick strangers
I bring with me
waiting for the brave soldier
with all my hatred
I want you
I will kill you
how does it feel to be my victim?
meet me in the mass grave
be my tormented slave
meet me in the mass grave
lie with me
This horror now asks for more
to the sad unfortunate progeny
I leave you my soul, bloodstained sister
Like a whisper for future generations
my corpse has been raped twice
And thrown down in this hole
among the others
the shadows of cruel atrocities
bring with you
I cravefor my brave soldier
with all my hatred
I want you
I will kill you
how does it feel to be my victim?
meet me in the mass grave
be my tormented slave
meet me in the mass grave
