cells within the flesh , gears within the mind
illusions, lies
lost in the factory of mechanical perception
into the dimension of infected reproduction
buried under faded faces, into dust
blind and consumed
each on his assembly blood-line
a ritual, to the eternity of an old
grey machinery
feasting on our rotting bodies
infected lungs, brains captivated
illness, lies, venom, anemia
icons of a new perfection, walking dead
blind and consumed
each on his assembly blood-line
hollow replicas of an old
grey machinery
feasting on our rotting bodies
infected lungs, brains captivated
illness, lies, venom, anemia
lost in the factory of impersonal mutation
with no consciousness of a human connotation
brainless, dumbness, lifeless
each on his assembly blood-line
pleased to feed an old
grey machinery
feasting on our rotting bodies
infected lungs, brains captivated
illness, lies, venom and anemia
