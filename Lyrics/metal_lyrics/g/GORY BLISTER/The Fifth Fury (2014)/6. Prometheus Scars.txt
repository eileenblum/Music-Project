Bound to the precipice,
his quivering wounds
opened to heaven, bleeding at dawn
Scorn and despair,
here is the glorious Man
warrior blind to the warfare
king reduced to a writhing shade
at the gates of his fallen palace
deaf to the calling of the dead
Foul Tyrant, who defied the Gods
and mother Earth betrayed,
tears under a crown of thorns and pain
slave of the post modern age
waste is the name of humanity
Darkness over the day
like blood out of Prometheus scars
once thick bodies,
now pale shades
once a heap of corpses after the war
delish flesh under vaulting crows
now ghosts underneath their graves
counting on a ferocious impending revenge
deaf to the calling of the dead
Foul Tyrant, who defied the Gods
and mother Earth betrayed,
Darkness over the day
like blood out of Prometheus scars
the shadows are condemned to wander on Earth
while their vacant shapes
to hold all human remains beneath
till death unite them in Hell
and they part no more
