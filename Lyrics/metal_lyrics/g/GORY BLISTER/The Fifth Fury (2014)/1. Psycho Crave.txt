Swallow me
Follow me where the sky is white
Dream
Is your brain that craves?
Here I am to cure
please your hunger
Do it at your leisure
Walk the same path
Take my hand
To the finest wrath
Tastes so good
Flesh feeding flesh
Flesh feeding flesh
Psycho Crave -Self addiction
Satisfy your hunger
Do it at your leisure
Eat me to the bone
Bite my leg
Weâll never walk alone
Tastes so good
More than your own blood
my own blood
Flesh feeding flesh
Flesh feeding flesh
Psycho Crave -Self addiction
The flesh consumption
The beast unleashed
The sin within me
The sin within you
Come where the beast is free
Weâll never walk alone
Tastes so good
More than your own bloodThreshold
