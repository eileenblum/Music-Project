DonÃ¹t you know the rotting scars
are the mouths of the dead
Time stitched with care
to drown the souls?

look at the stars in their eyes
watch the scars unseam and crusts melt down
If time reflects into a mirror, whoÃ¹s going to get old?
Wounds will bleed guts of time backwards!

Ancient faces staring at me
From blackened pictures stuck on a throbbing wall
while I sink back to the timeless black

a space ship is drowning
into the rambling flesh
into the rambling bleeding flesh
a black soul is condemned to creep down
down to the stomach to rejectÃ¯
to clear the anguish
at the center of the coil

I descend the dragon's cave
I am the angel Of the end

Don't you know the rotting scars
are the mouths of the dead
Time shut forever
Time shut forever?

Ancient faces stuck on a deceiving wall
Watch me sink back into the timeless black

Where I find my body
Watch it bleed
watch it bleed and shine
A black soul is condamned to crush down
thy holy Kingdom I erase
to sweeten the pain
at the center of the coil

I descend the dragon's cave
I am the angel Of the end
I never asked for this
