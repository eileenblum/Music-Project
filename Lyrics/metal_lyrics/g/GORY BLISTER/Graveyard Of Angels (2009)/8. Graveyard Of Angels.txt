Come to me now
thereÃ¹s no way out
abandon all hopes

I can hear a voice calling from the web of sanity

Depart you devil...
- I - Heed my prayer...
- Shall - Save your soul...
- NOT - For thy goodness...

I swallow pills of darkness
to join eternal dumbness
I drink the wine of relief
I renounce all beliefs

slit, swallowed, I follow the passage to GOA

holy stillness, rows of sinners
open fields of flowers to console and mourn
waving dancers, blessed be thy darkness
here your colours will never fade away

Depart you devil...
- I - Heed my prayer...
- Shall - Save your soul...
- NOT - For thy goodness...

I swallow pills of darkness
to join eternal dumbness
I drink the wine of relief
I renounce all beliefs

slit, swallowed, I follow the passage to GOA

Cleanse your heart...
Submit your soul...
Let light win...

- I - Depart you devil...
- Shall - Heed my prayer...
- hold - Save your soul...
my beauty in darkness...
