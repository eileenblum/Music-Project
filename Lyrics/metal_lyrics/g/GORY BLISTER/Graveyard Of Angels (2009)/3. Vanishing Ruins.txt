shocked, shuddered
shining brains, open grave, my brand new world
destroying brightness
I can feel them leave myself

Drops of linf
grains of sand
one by one fall

cells slowly rot to die
sickness sweeping through
a process of final demise
cruel majesty of time
everything passes, everything palls

slow and relentless, a futile passing away

as shining colours find their way
to meaningless shades of grey
my concreteness slides to frailty and fade
I am condamned
We are all vanishing ruins

Like breeding seeds, infected cells
Flourish and wait for their black reaper

I slide down on the glass of desolation

Flesh slowly rot to dust
Bones are subjected to rust
A process of demise
blains break out on my wasted skin
symptoms of ordained, relentless agony
sorcery of time
light is despair anguish and pain
everything dies

slow and relentless, a futile passing away

as shining colours find their way
to meaningless shades of grey
my concreteness slides to frailty and fade
I am condamned
We are all vanishing ruins
