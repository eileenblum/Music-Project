Into the void
A Species of ghost
Shapeless and black
moves

no breath, emptiness
trickling through nowhere

Deep, endless night
No life, no death

Light, evil rays, upon reality
a blaze of psychotic agony

The Hatch Opens now
The Hatch Opens wide
darkness fades away

A blinded realm
Coils down inside
the centre of warm rays

no more, endlessness
crawling through nowhere

Soil creation
Substance has formed
Chaos infection
Planets shooting everywhere

Hell leads the night
from life to death

Light, evil rays, upon reality
a blaze of psychotic agony 

The Hatch Opens now
The Hatch Opens wide
Paradise is lost

Lightfall - burning red
The dawn of forms and the living colours

Deathfall - blowing red
Nightcreatures die out

Downfall - flowing red
The chasm fades

Wind blows
Increasing the fury of the conflagration
A maelstrom of flaming waves
Consuming the abyss of eternity [2x]
The hatch opens now
