stone
a small stone in the past
forgotten weird dust
to the evil light breed
provided their needs

slow ancient living masses of involuted shapes
dominates this planet with no mercy, cruelty and pain

so huge and wicked
they eat their companionÃ¹s flesh
horrible creatures
bringers of raw devastation

I must exterminate - Evolution
I will extinguish all - Wicked motion
I cannot save this world

And let mine burn through millions ages
With my breeding darkness self

Cold winds, shadows black
Embrace them all
This is the slum
of the wretched creatures

Slum
upcoming downfall
soon they will crawl
this evil light breed
will starve and freeze

fiends
they will suffocate - Involution
they must dehydrate - inverse motion
they cannot save their lives

And let mine burn through millions ages
With my breeding darkness self

Cold winds, shadows black
Embrace them all
This is the slum
of the wretched creatures

cold winds, black dust, suffocation

descend and possess, clear the slum of the wretched creatures
exterminating, extinguishing, suffocating, dehydrating, annihilating
