lampstands beside the gate
open wide unto a deep rough furnace
glowing with fury
flames, flames, incense and embers

tongues of fire ascending red
clouds protecting a hideous creature
coiled, shaped like worm
viperÃ¹s voracious forked jaws
spitting horror and rage

mother of all dead!
If I close my eyes
I can feel Death rising inside
Thy kingdom come, the shining Hades!

Locusts from the smoke arise
To bring torment and pain

Venom drops from their tails
stings pierce and burn my plagued flesh
Blood, flowing down
the viperÃ¹s voracious forked jaws
spitting horror and rage

mother of all dead!
If I close my eyes
I can feel Death rising inside
Thy kingdom come, the shining Hades!

...back to the reign of emptiness...

Abyss full of hateful flames
Calls you
the hideous beast dominates
Abyss full of hateful flames
Loves you
the hideous beast arises to
Shining Hades

The shining Hades [x4]
