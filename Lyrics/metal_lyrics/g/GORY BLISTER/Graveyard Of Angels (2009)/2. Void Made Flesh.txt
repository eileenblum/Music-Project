Breathe, darkness goes
by the wind like an old curtain blown away

All the ghosts of the night have been burnt
All but one, unborn into a shell
Out of hell, in the shade of the womb
He will survive and take a new shape
Bones first take their form
A new frame is born

Infused is the soul of my breed in red blood
Engraved is the I of the void made flesh
Void-made flesh...

Harmonic, decaying, growing, demonic
Contaminated heretic
The age of perpetual creation
Cruel deception

Flying shadows in the night
your dark world has dissolved
like hoarfrost in the sun

A lost creature lives in a new shape
wet flesh generates
The new body's born

Infused is the soul of my breed in red blood
Engraved is the I of the void made flesh
Void-made flesh...

Wings, wings to fly, veins to bleed, flesh to rot
Eyes, eyes to see, skull to crush, birth to die
A beating heart, a heap of dry bones
