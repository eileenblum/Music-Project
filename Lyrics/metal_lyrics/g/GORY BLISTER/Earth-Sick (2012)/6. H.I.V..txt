Fluid as blood, uncoiled like a stream
Of venomous thoughts
Silent and vicious
The species seeps within
Impure, horrific
Evil, sick-sick-sick septic
The viscera degenerate eternally
Twisted hordes flowing through the flesh
Spilled into the red flux of the veins
Crushing all defense
Affliction, contagion, disease
Deviant, human beliefs
We are the cancer, we are the race
Heretic, infected, voracious
We are superior, we are the faith
Heretic, infected, voracious
Firm and relentless
Civilization falls
Impure, horrific
Evil, sick-sick-sick septic
The planet degenerates eternally
Chemicals spread into the ground
Spilled into the pure flux of the streams
Released in the air
Oblivion, contagion, decay
Deviant, human beliefs
We are the cancer, we are the race
Heretic, infected, voracious
We are superior, we are the faith
Heretic, infected, voracious
Slithering to extinction
Slightly to perdition
