Orchids of a deeper green
Serene, over the blackest sea
As the eyelids stand open
And the sky plunges in, reflected

The spell is cast in the eyes
Mine, foreseeing next passage
Of such a fashinating beauty
Only blindness can grasp and love

Because the comet passes
Shining faster than a wink
Leaving the green orchids
Drifting in a stormy sea

Courageous waves sweep over
Falling like rain drops
Down, till the eyes be shut
And another spell cast...
...foreseeing next passage

As RAIN fills in the SKY
SHE spread her HAPPINESS
Sailing over this SEA of TEARS
Trespassing the NEXT to the EVER

...rain
...sky
...she
...happiness
...sea
...tears
...next
...ever
