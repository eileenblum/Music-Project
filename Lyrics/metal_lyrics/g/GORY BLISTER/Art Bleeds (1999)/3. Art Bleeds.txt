(Viewpoints of dying artists)

'Life is
A luminous halo
A shower of atoms'
[V. WOOLF - "The Narrow Bridge Of Art"]

'Works of art are made
Of endless loneliness
It's only lave who can grasp and cherish them
Time is not a measure here
To be an artist means to grow like a patient tree
Trustfully resisting to the strongest spring winds
Without fearing that summer will not come
Cause summer will!'
[R.M. RILKE - "letters to a young poet"]

'When my disheartened soul roams inside
To catch an emotion death and life collide
And like moths attracted by a shining light that leads
The cells of heart set forth and so... so it bleeds!

'An everbleeding wound
A wound is art
And art forever bleeds'
[JOE - "art bleeds"]

'Timeless moments slaying death'
[T.S. ELIOT]

'Enchantments of the heart'
[J. JOYCE]

'Life is a heap
Of meaningless ironic ruins
Death the final montage through which
Our life can express ourselves
Life ends where it begins
The artist is a trembling idiot'
[P.P. PASOLINI]

'When my disheartened soul roams inside
To catch an emotion death and life collide
And like moths attracted by a shining light that leads
The cells of heart set forth and so... so it bleeds!

An everbleeding wound
A wound is art
And art forever bleeds'
[JOE - art bleeds]

'I want to be a poet
And i'm making myself voyant...'
[A.	RIMBAUD	-	"letter	to	G. Izambard"]
