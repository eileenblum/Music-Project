Roaming through the dark
And calm air of the night
As nature cries
Frozen tears sway down
To the tepid heart of earth...

(You never heard
The cries of earth fall down!)

...where their freezing kiss
Or natural heat prevails
They sing their hymn
The sweetest ever heard

You never heard
The hymn to life
That snow-flakes sing while dying!

Snowfall
Like tunes of falling frozen tears

When the coldness prevails
Through her eyes of gold
We shall enjoy the whiteness...
...shall enjoy the snow

Roaming through the dark
And calm air of the night
As nature cries
Frozen tears sway down
To the tepid heart of earth...

(You never heard
The cries of earth fall down)

Winds clean the sky
Spreading all the stars
And sweep the tears...

...and sweep the tears away

So nature burns
Moments in green
Before crying out her pain again

Like tunes of falling frozen tears

Hear the snow fall
