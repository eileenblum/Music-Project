There is a blackness riddled with starlight
So deep that distance flows on time, over time
Where the substance extends beyond sight
And silence seems to be wordless to rhyme

Silence seems so sad and wordless to rhyme
Indeed...sidereal space is not silent...

'I feel my inner warm fade away...close to my heart please would you stay
Your tears won't turn to ice, nor your eyes, I promise'

The voice of beating hearts of stardust we call quasars

There are black depths where rays will not gather
Cause infinite places are timeless, no time, no light
Yet time and light have to run together
An immense distance that seems to be measureless

The distance seems so sad and fleeting to time
Indeed...The darkest depths is not distant...

'See my dear, I shine no more, I've lost my kiss and need yours'
'And I'll pass thru cosmic space to overwhelm the distance and caress your face'

The voice of beating hearts of stardust we call quasars

But some ends come fast
To let the universe accomplish secret aims
Some stars turn to black
Others to dust
Death is what life claims

'We walked thru time hand-in-hand, our loving embrace has come to an end'
'This is our last hour, I know but no one will ever part us, oh none!'
