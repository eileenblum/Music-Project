It took me time to realise
The great flame for my heart burnt
And for my angel star it was suicide

I miss my burning sun
The atmosphere I breathe
I miss refreshing waters
Streams flowing on

The ground where I lay down
The sun around I spun

It took me time to realise
The great flame burnt my heart

Beyond the light I did not grasp
No more flames for my blood
For me, Dione, it is the end

I miss my burning heart
My whispering breath of wind
I miss refreshing kisses
Gouts spilt from

The source that fed my veins
The flame that made me spark

It took me time to realise
The great flame burnt my heart

Beyond the light I did not grasp
There is the void of my missing planet

Now that pain's in my chest
Even thinking of dying is pointless
Stoned inside my soul I rest
