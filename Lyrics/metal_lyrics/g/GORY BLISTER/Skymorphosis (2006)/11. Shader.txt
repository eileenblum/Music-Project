Of all spectacles of nature
There's one angels cannot miss
It's the moon who loves our star
She hides him into her kiss...within...

Centuries of horror...
Centuries of horror

A moonskin alien breed
Is feeding on our source
Encrusting forms of ice
Freeze all our sacred eyes...no!

Let the light be dark
And the sun shine black
Let the sun shine black

Her sweet shadow slowly crawls
Upon the sphere who warms our souls
Those few seconds of enchantment
Will be centuries of horror

Centuries of horror...
Centuries of horror

What seemed to us the eclipse
Is the awakening of the moon
The aliens and their ships
Will crash the human race...dead!

Let the light be dark
And the sun shine black
Let the sun shine black

Where is my star so bright
Who gives my bleeding heart
The heat of a shining light
The sense of a dying art?

Burning heart...
Burning art...
