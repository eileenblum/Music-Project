Please don't see, don't look at me, blood flows free
Please don't pray, don't look at this night sky
Advancing wrinkles encroaching upon moonskin

The long night of the dead
Begins with the moon and the stars burning red
Death, gushes of heaven's blood

The sun has just broken like a clear fragile wave
On the highest sharpened cliff
Overwhelmed like a tiny red cell
In the blood of a terminal anaemia

Every cloud is slowly turning into bleeding veins
And the stars preparing to be running taps

Night...Dead...Sky

Moths and owls are hunting thirsty like vampires
Eagerly devouring beats of human hearts

The last sunset has drowned in the cruellest night
Don't wake up tomorrow, cause I will be your...

...Blood sweating wall
Red gouts crawl
Don't search into a pool of gore for Heaven...I'm no more

Lost planets are weirdly changing into spiteful creatures
Galaxies are blinking awakening evil eyes

Night...Dead...Sky

Living dead are hungry pouncing on every breath of life
A cadaverous Heaven, an overflowing Hell

The last sunset has drowned in the cruellest night
Don't wake up tomorrow, cause I will be your...

...Blood sweating wall
Red gouts crawl
Don't search into a pool of gore for Heaven...I'm no more

Under a red mist, breath of Death
Lies a scared moon, torn to shreds
Over a dark sea, light sun splinters
Drown and sink into the deep
Black lungs of a dead lost...paradise

Night...Dead...Sky, Your Blood Sweating Wall
