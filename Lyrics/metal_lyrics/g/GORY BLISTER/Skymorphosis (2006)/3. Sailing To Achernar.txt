Dead blackest space
I voyage to see this void
To reach that star ablaze
With self-brightening beauty

The moon was kissing the sea
A hopeful eyes wave
Is their flying soul
And the sailing ships were booming
As the space wind was sweeping

We have followed dreaming paths

Hallucinating smoke,
Smoke rings,
A mist leading to
A sweet marzipan sky enlightened by
Her self-brightening beauty

Suddenly came a stronger blow
That shot me down in fear
Where the guiding path was not

The void arose and made me scream for her

Dead blackest space
I voyage not to see this void
To reach that star ablaze
With self-brightening beauty

As a wave flared up
To moonless sky
Her gaze restored my eyes
My ears could hear her voice
And my skin could feel her kiss

We have followed dreaming paths

(When we woke up next day, our eyes told each other
That soon our space ship would weigh anchor again)
