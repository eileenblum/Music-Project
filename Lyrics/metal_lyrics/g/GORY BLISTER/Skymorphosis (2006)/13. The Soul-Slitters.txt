Red rivers of blood
Free from the chains of flesh
Dissolve and merge into
White tongues of ice

Like shreds of a sinking sun
Seeping through hanging clouds

That announce one more waking up
A new deceitful dawn

Mingled with a thick snow
Alien nails falling from space

This is the last act, the ultimate crush
The final attack of the soul-slitters

They are stings of ice
They pierce your flesh to nail your soul
All your blood flows outside
Your frozen soul will slit into a blast of
New soul-slitters

Silver spears, sharpened swords
Tearing up, lacerate

Like ants terrorized
Human being scuttle away

There is no God, or Holy deception
To save mankind from the final attack
The realm of the soul-slitters

They are stings of ice
They pierce your flesh to nail your soul
All your blood flows outside
Your frozen soul will slit into a blast of
New soul-slitters

Mankind slides away
Like a damp drop
On the smooth sweating glass of nothingness
