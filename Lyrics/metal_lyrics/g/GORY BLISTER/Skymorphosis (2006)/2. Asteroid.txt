No start, never to end
Rolling to nowhere

Cores of gaseous dust
Infertile fragments
Of what once were planets

I'm source of no light
Cold, no heart, just fright
Eternal life in black
No planets to smack

Meaningless existence
I flame, death deserves
To kiss a heart who starves
Darkness into me, into me

Longing to end in a shooting star
Asteroid
To live is to streak the sky with sparks

No start, never to end
Staring at nowhere

Sky of painted stars
Slay my naked heart
With silver arrows flashing

My life's not so smart
Cold, my soul's so stark
Dreams and boring flesh
Damned to smash

Meaningless existence
I live flash deserves
To feed my heart who starves
Darkness into me, into me

Longing to end in a shooting star
Asteroid
To live is to streak the sky with sparks

"Will a suicidal sparkle
Ever streak the blackened sky
And kiss this longing eye
Like a both-sides burning candle"

Darkness into me
