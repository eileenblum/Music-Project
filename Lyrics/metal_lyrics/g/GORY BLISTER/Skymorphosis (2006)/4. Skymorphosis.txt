Fuck you God for giving light to a miserable
Show me you exist in the emptiness of Heaven
Please gouge my eyes

I used to stare at the stars
Miriad of stars, a lot of lies
Just one night the map changed
And my poetry deranged

The sky seems so firm
Until you take your turn to sink
Into worms

And I was caught in a hostile verse
The sky metamorphosys

Like a Phoenix I will rise
To myself I promise
As I'm wondering why
It is no more the same sky

I used to stare at my blood
I used to stare at red roses
In a carpet I found tombstones
Just one night the ground opened
And my poetry ended

The earth seems so firm
Until you take your turn to cry
Among lambs

And I was caught in a hostile verse
The sky metamorphosys

As I burn to ashes
For the next thousand ages

As I burn to ashes

As I burn to ashes...
