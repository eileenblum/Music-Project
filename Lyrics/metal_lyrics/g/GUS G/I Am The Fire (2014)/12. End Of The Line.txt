Precious are the memories
Golden in my mind
Always and forever they remain

Somewhere in my heart I know
The end has just begun
Still I'm trying not to be afraid

I keep on searching for the way
Beyond the horizon life awaits

Doubt's my only enemy
Shadow on the wall
Could there be a light after the dark?

What's the use in bothering with
Things I can't control
My destiny is waiting after all

Maybe I'll never love again
I'm praying that changes lie ahead

As days turn colder
Turn into night
Won't run for cover
At the end of the line
The race ain't over
I'll reconcile
Just trust me, brother
At the end of the line

You head for the great escape
Like many before
Nothing could prepare me for the fall...

Finally I'll begin to grow
Learning what everybody knows

As days turn colder
Turn into night
Won't run for cover
At the end of the line
The skies above us
As old as time
Will guide us, brother
Til' the end of the line
So trust me brother
At the end of the line
