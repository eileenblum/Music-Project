Looking back to those simpler days
They were the times of our lives
The memories, they can't be erased
And so the years will remind

All the years and the vows
We promise we'd always remain
All unforgettable moments
They're here to stay

Do you remember those summer days
When were young and free
Do you remember those summer nights
When we ere living the dream
We took our time
There were no tomorrows
The summer nights in our souls
They go on and on and on...

July mornings were everything
To wash away the April rain
All those summer songs on the radio
We danced the nights away

Not a care in the world
The memories will always remain
(We'll always be together)
Though the years have gone by and we're older
The seasons call our names
