I used to believe in holding onto dreams
Now suddenly they never mattered
Now all that I see has slowly disappeared
I stare into an empty mirror
Nobody is perfect
Is it really worth it to let this go to waste

Just let me break away, break away
Release my tension
Nothing's left between the ledge and the ground
Take away, take away my regression
I'm on the edge, another step
It's a long way down

I'm ready to give in
I'm ready to let go
Drowning tears in silent laughter
Will I reach the end? Will I ever know?
See you in the ever after
Just one way to fall
One more step is all
Don't you, don't you care?
