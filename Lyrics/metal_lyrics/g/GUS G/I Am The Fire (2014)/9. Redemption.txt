Good and evil on my path
I'm not leaving any trace for you to track
You played around for much too long
And you can't undo what's already been done

You care enough to know that you don't care
Unless I lay it on the line
I know your every lie

Redemption â Come feel the truth
And wake up inside 
Redemption â Drown in misery
Or see the best in you

The war is over, we paid in red
Now the time has come, give up your last defense
Receive salvation from every sin through my sacrifice
Our only way to win

Sometimes I hate you
But most times I don't 
We can't escape, nowhere to run
'Cause I know your every lie

Redemption â Come feel the truth
And wake up inside 
Redemption â Drown in misery
Or see the best in you and me

Redemption â Just think it through
Your secret is mine

Redemption â Come feel the truth
And wake up inside 
Redemption â Drown in misery
Or see the best in you 

Redemption â Kill the misery
I want the best of you
