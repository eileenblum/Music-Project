Talk is cheap
It's everywhere
And it's incomplete
You want that good shit
Come see me
Money can't buy honesty
(Honestly)
Straight line source
Uncut, untouched and pure
You know I've got what you're looking for
And what I've got is worth so much more

It's out of your hands
It's out of your reach
If you can't understand what I am

I am not the smoke
I'm not the air that feeds
I'm not the heat and burn
I am the fire

I'm not the ash and bone
I'm not the scar it leaves
I'm not peel and burn
I am the fire

Watch your step
You don't even know how bad it gets
You haven't even seen the real world yet
You're better off if your don't forget
(So don't forget)
You got to watch your back
Every choice, every chance you have
And I'll be there keeping you on track
Your best bet
Remember that, remember that

It's out of your hands
It's out of your reach
If you can't understand what I am

I am not the smoke
I'm not the air that feeds
I'm not the heat and burn
I am the fire

I'm not the ash and bone
I'm not the scar it leaves
I'm not peel and burn
I am the fire
