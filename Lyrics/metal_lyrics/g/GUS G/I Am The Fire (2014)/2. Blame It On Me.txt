Finally getting over it
Gonna make it alright
I kept on doing all the wrongs
Now I wanna do right

I'll be alive tomorrow
Forever starts today

I'll keep up the fight, the rebellion
Stand up and play
Back on the road that I gotta run
My way's the only way

Blame it on me, blame it on me
God only knows what lie you're defending
Blame it on me, I'm ready to leave
Yea, whatever it takes to be free again

You're prowling like an animal 
Searching for it all night
Hungry faces everywhere
Looking but there's no light

'Cause inside your demons are legion
Feeding the vain
And outside the battle is raging on
I'm getting used to pain

Blame it on me, blame it on me
God only knows what lie you're defending
Blame it on me, I'm ready to leave
I can't lie to myself, won't get fooled again
Blame it on me, blame it on me
Somebody tell me why you're pretending
Blame it on me, I'm ready to leave
I'll do whatever it takes to be free again

'Cause my way's the only way
