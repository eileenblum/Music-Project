I hit the gas out on the road
And I don't care about tomorrow
I see the places that you don't
I will command and you will follow

Why not, get on it, life depends on it
And I'm gonna survive
I felt your disgust
In myself I trust
I am right â you are wrong
My will be done

I can't change the past, I'm moving on
Won't seek revenge, no act of vengeance
I take every chance, I'm on my own
Declare my state of independence

Why not, get on it, life depends on it
And I'm gonna survive
I felt your disgust
In myself I trust
I am right â you are wrong
My will be done

Step on the gas, I eat the road
I'm born to lead, you're born to follow

Why not, get on it, life depends on it
And I'm gonna survive
Filled with your disgust
You betrayed my trust
I am right â you are wrong
My will be done
Left you in the dust
Fought the fight, split up
Trust me â I am the one
My will be done
