I hear the words they never said
Pride before the fall 
Rise above and move ahead
Without a chance at all

I searched a story never told
To stay out of the hole
My veins are burning, sweating cold
Yet I won't let it show

Inside the heartache
Outside no pain

Living with eyes wide open
Well on my way to kingdom come
Dying with eyes wide open
I'm ready to fly
Stay behind the shadow dark

Death's alive and glorious 
We follow where you go
Infamousânotorious
Yea, everybody knows

That fate's in league with some of us
Plays with hidden hands
Time's a thief so clinical
Father of the damned

I walk before you
But gone all the same

Living with eyes wide open
Well on my way to kingdom come
Dying with eyes wide open
I'm ready to fly
Stay behind the shadow dark

He's coming after all of us
The reaper without name
And once he is victorious
No one's left to blame

Living with eyes wide open
Well on my way to kingdom come
Dying with eyes wide open
I'm ready to fly
Stay behind the shadow dark
Falling with eyes wide open
I'm ready to fly
Won't survive the shadow dark
