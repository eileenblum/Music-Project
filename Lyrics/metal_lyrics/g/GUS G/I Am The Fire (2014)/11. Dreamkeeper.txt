Always knew it'd come to this
That I'd leave the pain for bliss
I'm breathing easier, yeah just so much easier
I've learned to trust us two
Now you confide in us, too
Always knew it'd come to this
Always knew we'd see our wish

Come true to carry on
Pull through to overcome
Follow through

Dreams do come true and there's one for me and one for you
Inspire us to carry on
They carry us when days are dark
Please remind me when times are blue
I'd be sure to do the same for you
Together we will stop a fall
Bleed for me I'll bleed for you
Dream for me I'll dream for you

Come true to carry on
Pull through to overcome
We're dreamkeepers
Come true to carry on
Pull through to overcome
We're dreamkeepers
