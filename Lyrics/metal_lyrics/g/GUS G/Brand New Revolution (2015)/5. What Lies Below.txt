All the bridges left to cross
And the bridges yet to burn
A connection ends up lost
And we're severed from this world

Just close your eyes and walk my way
If you decide to stay

Beneath these lights, the darkness has no home
We cling to life, when life releases hold
And when we fall, we fall down on our own
Into what lies below

Whatsoever we have lost
And whatsoever we might gain
Another battle left unfought
Antoher enemy remains

Just close your eyes and walk my way
If you decide to stay
