Bury your secrets, no one knows
Did you think you'd die alone
All the wasted feelings, guess I should have known
The ones that hurt the most

It's all fading, the scar remains
Now the dirt covers your mistakes
All the pain that you try to hide
I can see it behind those eyes

Picking up the pieces, scattered on the floor
We can't go back anymore
Wasting away, at the bottom of a bottle
This time it's over

It's all fading, the scar remains
Now the dirt covers your mistakes
All the pain that you try to hide
I can see it behind those eyes

I'm still holding on
But you're letting go
There's no going back, it's over now
