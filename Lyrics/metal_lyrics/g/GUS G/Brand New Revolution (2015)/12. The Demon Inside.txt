Every waking hour, an eternal maze
I am trapped inside a stranger that I used to know

I got a million reasons for the words I said
I almost remember when I believed them all

The weight of the lies
Now, what is it I can't see (behind your eyes)
A menacing evil, I was caught off guard
Yea, you are the mother of my every scar

It's all in my mind, the demon inside
And no one knows how I feel
On this island of mine, I'm deaf, dumb and blind
The ships I see seem so real...

I can't escape what I am going through
Seems like yesterday's hero is tomorrow's fool
A question I'm scared to know the answer to
No, I never thought that life would be so cruel

It's all in my mind, the demon inside
And no one knows how I feel
On this island of mine, I'm deaf, dumb and blind
The ships I see seem so real...
