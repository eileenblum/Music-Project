We are one now
And we won't back down
We're taking back all that's come undone

Blame it onthe big machine that took it all away
A permanent solution with one foot in the grave
When it all comes crashing down and goes up in the flames
I see the writing on the wall, of the words that went unspoken
This is a call to all the fallen and the broken
We can rise and we can fall, but we won't hit the ground

We are one now
And we won't back down
We're taking back all that's come undone

We're rising up now
And we all stand proud
The blood will spill as we take our throne
We are one

Born to follow we are one, they say we're lost and hopeless
I watch the sun burning out, but they never notice
When it's all said and done we won't hit the ground
