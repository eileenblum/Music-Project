I'm stealing the truth from your mouth
The treason you can't live without
A serpent comes out of my skin
If I had a heart, I'd give in

You're drowned by the tears I can't cry
You scream but who gave you the right?

I've got nothing left to gain
I'm surviving all the same
I'm burning candles in the rain
Even if it ends today

I lied from the moment we met
I'm no good at feeling regret
The shield that is keeping me safe
It protects me from losing my way
