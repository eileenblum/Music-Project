Hey, you,
What you gonna do
When the hangman comes?
Oh, no,
Where you gonna go
When you're all alone

I've got a thousand reasons
I won't let it go
Behind the eyes of strangers
That you'll never know

Burn
Gonna make you crawl
Gonna bring you down
'Cause I'll never forget your words
'Til the day you burn

Headlines
The ink that tries
To hide the secrets we all know
Black skies
Your head held high
With the noose around your throat

We've got a million reasons
To never let it go
Behind the eyes of strangers
That you'll never know

Burn
Gonna make you crawl
Gonna bring you down
'Cause I'll never forget your words
'Til the day you burn

Burn
Gonna make you crawl
Gonna bring you down
'Cause I'll never forget your words
'Til the day you burn
Gonna make you crawl
Gonna bring you down
'Cause I'll never forget your words
'Til the day you burn
