We had out battles, wars to fight
It came out wrong, but felt so right
The true intentions that turned to fear
I got a one-way ticket out of here

Hell or high water
It's just a matter of pride
You must break free
Hell or high water
You know I'm back here to save you again
Come hell or high water

A little lie was just enough
To break the ice and call your bluff
I know you're tired of being afraid
No, don't waste this moment - don't fade to grey

Hell or high water
It's just a matter of pride
You must break free
Hell or high water
You know I'm back here to cary your weight
Come hell or high water
