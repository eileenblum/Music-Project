Tell me how it feels to live with the haunted
Is this what you wanted, it's coming down
See no evil, sew your eyes shut

Their rules we, won't follow
We're waiting in the shadows
No more wrong, no more right
Don't tell me, it gets better
When things keep going nowhere
No more rules, a brand new revolution

Lined up for battle, we're cocked and loaded
The self imploded
Thet're going down
Hear no evil, silence the screams

Their rules we, won't follow
We're waiting in the shadows
No more wrong, no more right
Don't tell me, it gets better
When things keep going nowhere
No more rules, a brand new revolution
