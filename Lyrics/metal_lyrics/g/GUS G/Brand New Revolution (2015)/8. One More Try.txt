Take away, take it all away
Don't wanna be here anymore
Every road I walk down leads me back again
To this empty place that I've been livin' in, and it feels like I'm

Stuck inside these empty pages
But everything's gonna be alright, I'm turnin'
Been down, but I'm making changes
Gonna give it one more try, I'm on my way

Chasing rainbows, for that pot of gold
It's not out there anymore
Protecting secrets everyone already knows
We cover all the scars that we don't wanna show, but I'm letting go

Stuck inside these empty pages
But everything's gonna be alright, I'm turnin'
Been down, but I'm making changes
Gonna give it one more try, I'm on my way

All the times I've thought of giving up
When the world was crashing down
I drank the poison from a golden cup
But you came and saved me now
