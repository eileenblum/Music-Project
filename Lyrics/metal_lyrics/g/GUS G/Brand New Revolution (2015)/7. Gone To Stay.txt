That's it I'm over you 
See what you put me thru
This time you've gone too far
You've pushed me to the edge
You got me walking on the ledge
Who do you think you are?

You say you're not to blame for my soul that's burning
You say it's all the same as the world keeps turning
Now I will paint the truth, I'm done with all the lies
I won't be fooled again cause this time I'm gone to stay

Your cause is overblown
I'd rather be alone
And I'd say it's time for redemption
It's high time you know the pain
About time you feel the same
No remorse for your intention
