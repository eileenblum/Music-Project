Pride and empathy
It's a battle to survive
But now it's crumbling ayay
Is there nothing left in this fight?

We are freedom, we are united
But you killed our dreams and left us divided
Thousands leaving, for new salvation
Those left bleeding, you are the Generation G!

Tried and crucified
For holding to belief
The never-ending war ahead
Is just a life of anarchy

We are freedom, we are united
But you killed our dreams and left us divided
Thousands leaving, for new salvation
Those left bleeding, you are the Generation G!

Where are we going to
When will we know
We've all been played like we're all part of the show
