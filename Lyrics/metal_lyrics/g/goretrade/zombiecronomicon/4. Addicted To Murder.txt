[Lyrics &amp; Music - Andrea Cipolla]

At 6:47 p.m. there's the new episode of Addicted To Murder
Brains fly
Skating on red globules
It's a good telefilm

They say Tv is reality
If TV says It then it's true
I'll become a serial killer

I switch on the Tv
But I don't see a thing
A would-be serial killer
