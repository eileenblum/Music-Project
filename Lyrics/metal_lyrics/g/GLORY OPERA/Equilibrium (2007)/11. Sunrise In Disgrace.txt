[Rothen / DÃ¡cio]

[captors]
Bleed tonight, watch our blades
Cutting your heads down
Smell dead meat screams
From children crying
Look behind, spears and arrows
Taking impure hearts
(outside my dreams)

[Iara]
I have seen all inside my dreams
But I have never thought
It would come alive
Please forgive me, I fell short
To tell this just in time

[warrior prince]
Pulsing through all the ground
I can feel my people
Slowly falling down
One tear from each lost life
Fragile as the voice on my mind
My mind can't believe what I see
My heart is bleeding.
The story will not finish here
This is not the end
