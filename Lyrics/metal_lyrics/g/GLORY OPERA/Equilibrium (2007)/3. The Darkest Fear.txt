[Jean Rothen / Emerson DÃ¡cio]

If I walk at night no insolent
Stare into my eyes
'Cause these they'll see
Frightening sparks
Twisting their souls
No way to be safe from my
Mind
I have seen no mortal man
Who's ready to be free
Hear my voice
And just my scary voice

[Pre-chorus]
Who will dare to cross
My destiny and provoke me?
There is only one
Shaman like me, try to face this

[Chorus]
Show me your darkest fears
I'm the worst of them
With my sorcery
I will rule this land
I am every tree
Crawling clouds of rain
I will be the snake's poison
That kills your silently

[Pre-chorus]

That's my intention,
That's my kingdom
There is only one
Shaman like me, try to face this
