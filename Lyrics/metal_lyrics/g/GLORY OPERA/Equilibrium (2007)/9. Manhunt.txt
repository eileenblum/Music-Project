They found out I've killed their coward prince
I have to leave my shelter, run away from here
Deadly stalkers, I can't beat them all
I'll return when I'm ready to fight again

[Pre-chorus]
Something's wrong in my heart
A strange voice calls me but I can't see no one
It tells me I must get back home
In my mind, I can't forget those words
Terrified, I've never felt like this before
It seems all the trees leads me outside this land
But I'm still too far, they're smelling all my fear

It's more than my life, my tribe depends on me
A disgrace is about to come
They must be warned the enemy will strike
Genocide!
I'll fly like a leaf on the Wind
