[Part I - Dark Serenity]

[Jean Rothen / CasÃ© Mar / Emerson DÃ¡cio]

Slowly I hear a calling,
I feel it's not the end.
I don't know if I'm dreaming
So I look around and then
There's a lady smiling,
She's taking care of me.
A soft light shines around her,
I don't even know her name.
I found life safer in her warm arms

[Iara]
Dreaming,
It's easier to us
I can heal your spirit and your heart
I found life so fragile in your sleep

[warrior]
Now I need a reason
Believe this is not real
A face I can't forget
And if I could, it's not my will
I fall down tired, come to sleep, please

[Iara]
You will not remember me
Our story is just beginning
While this love is hidden into my heart
I'll be your star

[Part II - Dead In My Dreams]

[Jean Rothen / Emerson DÃ¡cio]

Now everthing turns into gray
It fades away
What is this?
These shadows getting close to me
My body freezes, I can't feel my lips
My lucidity is gone

[Pre-chorus]
I hear them calling me
And now I'm not afraid of
The spirits of the warrior kings

[Chorus]
They touched my mind
With stories of believes and lies
All the truth I couldn't see
No Indian war can be won
If the leader falls down
I'll have to leave this place of dreams
I was not prepared for this
But inside me, I feel the pressure
What is this? My destiny is now revealed
I dare to see trough their dark eyes
My sanity is gone

[Part III - Blind Eyes, Blind Heart]

[Jean Rothen / CasÃ© Mar]

Tonight we've been so close
But I still can't see
'Cause my eyes were shut
Moved by pain and love
In the chaos I breathe in the air
Where do you come from, tell me?
Silence makes me die slowly
'Cause my heart is blind
I'm afraid of love
And the pain, I can't breathe the air

[Part IV - The Taste Of Revenge]

[Glory Opera]

The sunlight burn my eyes
Death forgot to take me
There's no more pain or scare
My awakening time has come
I'm feeling strong enough
To face a hundred men
It is time for payback
No regrets for their tears.

[Pre-chorus]
A dark voice is telling me to go on
No prayer on my enemies

[Chorus]
The rival tribe will taste fury and revenge
With power that grows inside my heart
I will wait here to kill the coward prince
Who think I've died

[Iara]
If the story of your life is becoming dark
Don't worry
'Cause sometimes these dreams
May confuse you, I'll be always with you
It's not for my life I fear to cry
Because we are like two rivers tied

[Part V - The Ghost Within]

[Glory Opera]

Am I awake? Can't see her face.
I am feeling, she's my soul mate
Who's that lady wandering in my dreams?

[Iara]
No sadness, no loneliness
'Cause I'm here praying

[warrior]
Why died she save me
And simply disappeared?

[Iara]
No answers, just silence,
'Cause now I'm leaving

[warrior]
Give me something to believe
Just a sing to know you're real
You're the shinning light of my way.

[Part VI - Eyes In Torment]

[Glory Opera]

Wrath!
Come to my crushing reality
Now you have no more to help you out
Sticking the blade in your skin
No witness for your empty screams
Running from me won't make survive
Spilling out blood, a matter of time
This is my rite, your dying eyes
Beholding my sarcastic smile

[Pre-chorus]
The blood hides the green of the trees
Nowhere to hide, there is no way out
Just you and me, where's your bravery?
I am your fate, your hangman
My voice will rest inside your head
I'll be the ruler, show some respect
Because this might be your last act
Where is your pride? Ask for your life
The desperation in you eyes

[Pre-chorus]
The blood hides the green of the trees
Your poor life is nothing in my hands
Silence sounds louder than death

[Chorus]
I am the terror in your eyes, I see
My enemy is crawling
The time slows down when you look at me
Suffering, the torment start
Evil control my hands
Excruciation your body
Pleasure while I am
Chopping it up

[Part VII - Regret And Shame]

[Jean Rothen / CasÃ© Mar]

Without control, I've lost my will
What's happening to me?
All this rage that lies in my heart
Came mysteriously
and took away my sanity
The nightfall brings me the sorrow
Shame and tears
I hope for a chance so I can
Fly out this lunacy
All that pain that lies in my heart
Vanishing slowly
And bringing back my sanity
My regret consuming my conscience
But now there is to time
I have to forget and stay alive
The nightfall brings me the sorrow
Shame and tears
