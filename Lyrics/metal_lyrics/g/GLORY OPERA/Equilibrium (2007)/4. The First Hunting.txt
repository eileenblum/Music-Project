[Jean Rothen / CasÃ© Mar]

The jungle breaths under the rain
Hiding secrets that i want to see
A legendary giant snake
Stalks after me in silence
In my first hunting I'm alone
The forest screams my name
This must be done
Running across the dark old trees
I feel the death behind me
One lines, the other dies now
Face to face, hunter and prey
That's the time to prove my strain
Shredded skin, the fight begins
We are alike, the man and the beast
So much blood, I can't avoid the sore
The next struggle will reveal if I'll win
Wait the last second, it will last forever
See the thin line of life pushin' away
Some force from within
Tell me to feel no fear
One lived, the other died now
Eye to eye, hunter and prey
There is only place for me
Healed skin, the fight is done
We were alike, now I'm alone
I drink your fresh warm blood
Under a full moon,
The first hunting comin' true!
