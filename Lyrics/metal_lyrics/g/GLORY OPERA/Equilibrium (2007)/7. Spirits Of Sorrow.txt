[Rothen / Sobrinho]

I tried so many ways
To free my heart from you
I fear all was in vain
Seduced by the unknown
You changed so much inside
A plague seized my soul
I wait for you on the dusking day
My spirit lies in sorrow
The love survived but I'm still afraid
Of the truth behind
What happened to you?

[Chorus]
I will whisper to you
Through birds and all the living creatures
But you will never know
That it's my voice what you hear
I tried so many ways
To free my heart from you
I fear all was in vain...
For you I'd stay away forever
