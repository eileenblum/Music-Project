[Rothen / Sobrinho / DÃ¡cio]

[warrior Prince]
...End of the day
I try to flee alone
They tried to find me
Before the night come down
I still can hear,
The captors after me
I'll leave them behind
Until the night is gone

[Cacique]
Celebrate, my bravest son has won!
And he'll be here to know
The legend of his name will be spread
Bring the children, come to dane!
The party has begun.
All the loneliness is gone
Just hear the beating of our hearts

[Pre-chorus]
This moment will be know as the first day
of the kingdom that's to come

[Chorus]
No one can leave this place without
Screaming loud so the moon can hear
The victory is on our side
No one can feel the way I'm proud
Raise your knives and tear the sky
To bleed my son's name on the stars

[warriors]
Tonight we feel we can go on
And conquer the world
