[Jean Rothen / Emerson DÃ¡cio / Helmut Quacken]

[warrior prince]
I've lost my track again
And I guess I walk on hostile land
There's a chance to meet
The enemy today
Sooner than I'd expected
I see three warriors coming over
To attack and they failed

[enemy prince]
I'll let you die in your disgrace
I killed the weakest man but
Got hit by a venomous blade
I can feel my senses tearing apart
If you survive we will fight again

[Iara]
I can't be seen tonight
When they leave, I'll cure him

[Chorus]
I've been waiting forever
For this moment for this man
I'm a strange to him
But to me he's the one i have to save
