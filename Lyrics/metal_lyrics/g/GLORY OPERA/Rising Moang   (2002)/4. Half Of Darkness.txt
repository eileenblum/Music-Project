Time will not freeze,
Live your dreams to find
Answers for things from inside.

In the middle of nowhere
You are afraid to face your fate
Learn the lesson day by day
Until it ends

Why do you leave our home
Late at night?
Why? The fear is outside.

With no fire to light your way,
Like a candlelight you fell
The wind is whispering
Even the moon is dark a
 nd dead

Why do you leave our home
Late at night?
Why? Maybe you should
Keep your sorrow
And stay here inside.

[Chorus]
Look through the heart of your soul
See the glorious life you rised
Before you understand
The price of your mistake

Why do you leave our home
Late at night?
Why? The fear is outside.

Why do you leave our home late at night?
Why? Maybe you should keep your sorrow
And stay here inside.
