Life passes by so fast,
Just shadows
Of what you should really find,
Never paradise,
The path of nails torn inside.

Limits could be reached out,
If broken down, but scared,
You've lost the chance
To see the world
With different eyes.

[Pre Chorus]
Light won't shine on you
'till the winter...
All the wisdom can't bring me
The visions of paradise,
That lives inside me now

No matter if you crawl
And feel not proud, this is the price,
The conquest sight
May not be just the way
You've thought.

Go on and on and feel
Like you have never existed,
It's coming the time
To leave your wishes burn alive.

[Chorus]
Fall from sky in no one's land,
Can't raise the eyes and face
No strenght enought to hold.
This dream drowned in faith,
Uncovering while waits,
Where secrets lie untold.

[Solos: Stanley / Jean]

If I still dive without fear,
From the deep sky without tears.

[Repeat Chorus]
