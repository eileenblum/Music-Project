Watching remains from dust,
Expecting to unhinge all the signs
From this thoughts.
I just can't keep clearmy mind,
Waiting, (for) my breathe inside.

[Chorus]
Why am I escaping,
If I do not wish to wake up?
There's no way to pull me out,
I don't belong to this hell!

Faceless, my dignity,
In my world of mirrors,
Lies is the truth.
Destiny cannot stare me,
I shouldn't be a piece of you.
Fearless, your hands on me,
Taking away this life from me.
All the past hasn't existed,
My dreams are gone.
This isn't what I wanted it to be...

[Repeat Chorus]

Every moment in this place,
I just look back, and live to wait.
Hearing no words, lips are sealed,
Rime of secrets unraveled.

[Solos: Jean / Stanley]

[Part 2 - The Final Revelation]

I've lost this life, now it's done,
But I still feel
That thread keeping me.
How can I ease this pain,
Spinning in my head?

Answers coming and going
All the time,
I don't have enough to waste,
It's right,
And I fell so empty as I bleed.
Flashes of my days
Tearing my eyes,
Holding down my hands,
Now I can't fight,
And I pray the L
 ord to finnish this.

I just can't go on,
There's no strenght,
I'll learn the last dance tonight.
And once I'm ready, I can't go back,
I am just one step behind.
No matter where I am,
Or I'm supposed to be,
No questions to be answered, I am free.
