Voices from the other side
Behind stained glass
Theyï¿½re waiting for a guest
Reflections, distortions of yourself
Wrathful shadows
Are living in this maze

Eyes in a mirror world
Reveal your truth of your inner views

Time is lost without a trace
Deep inside this mirror mace
Shadows in a haze
Like demons with your face

Darkness imprisoning the mind
Dead close to madness
The verge of despair
Soulless grimaces so unreal
Indicating traits
That are lying deep within

Eyes in a mirror world
Reveal your truth of your inner views

Time is lost without a trace
Deep inside this mirror mace
Shadows in a haze
Like demons with your face

Time is lost without a trace
Deep inside this mirror mace
Shadows in a haze
Like demons with your face

Phantoms of hate and death appear
Inverting every mind
Daring to go inside
Illusions or reality
The day of reckoning
Uncovering our souls

Eyes in a mirror world
Reveal your truth of your inner views

Time is lost without a trace
Deep inside this mirror mace
Shadows in a haze
Like demons with your face
