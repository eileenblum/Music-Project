They are carved in stone
By nature's hands
Sculptures made for eternity
To witness aeons of fate
Faces and limbs
Build by random force
But so real staring
Like the eyes of the world

Secret signs from the other world
Forever for all to see
Secret signs from the other world
Telling tales of the history

A land from beyond
Of spirit filled stones
Can tell so much more
Than libraries reveal
But there are signs
Rising up from the past
To show us another world
Sometimes we remember

Secret signs from the other world
Forever for all to see
Secret signs of the other world
Telling tales of the history

Secret signs from the other world
Forever for all to see
Secret signs of the other world
Telling tales of the history
