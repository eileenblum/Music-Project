Falling into emptiness
Where nothing else will last
Embraced by loneliness
Forgotten is the past

Be welcome my friend
At the dawn of a new age
With a wave of a hand
Create a land and be a sage
A world to invent
At the dawn of a new age
With a wave of a hand
Diviner of the next page of dreams

A land created only by thoughts
Damned or chosen by the gods
A heavy burden that's to bear
Be the storyteller's heir
The mind is caught inside a web
Oblivion claws into the head
Remembrance fades with every wish

Be welcome my friend
At the dawn of a new age
With a wave of a hand
Create a land and be a sage
A world to invent
At the dawn of a new age
With a wave of a hand
Diviner of the next page of dreams

An endless story that is told
Where the feather creates the world
The storybook will show the way
But thereï¿½s a dreadful price to pay
Where is the long forgotten path
Redeem the world from its wrath
No answer in reality
Save the world of fantasy

Be welcome my friend
At the dawn of a new age
With a wave of a hand
Create a land and be a sage
A world to invent
At the dawn of a new age
With a wave of a hand
Diviner of the next page of dreams
