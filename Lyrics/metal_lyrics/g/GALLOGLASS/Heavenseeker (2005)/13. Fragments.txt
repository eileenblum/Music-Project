[Bonus track]

Iï¿½m witnessing strange occurrences
In the labyrinth of my mind

Persons and places I know
Appearing in abstract relations
Between visions and reality

Unconsciousness frees memories
That I wonï¿½t remember awake
Hidden in unreal sceneries
Locked in the depths of my mind

Fragments of reality
That scene behind my eyes
If I only could remember
These pictures in my head
Fragments of reality
That scene behind my eyes
If I only could remember

The sensual world lies deep within
Burning in riot and in motion
The storm of pictures on the edge
Can`t seize it with my rapid eyes

Fragments of reality
That scene behind my eyes
If I only could remember
These pictures in my head
Fragments of reality
That scene behind my eyes
If I only could remember

Fragments of reality
That scene behind my eyes
If I only could remember
These pictures in my head
Fragments of reality
That scene behind my eyes
If I only could remember
