I look straight into the light
That blinds me in the dark
That haunts my sleep at night
The fear that grips my heart

Don't kneel to the master
I hold my head upright
To kneel is to suffer and to die
Be aware of your might

Eyes of red keep gleaming
Looking filled with hate,
Until I wake up screaming.
I don't accept this fate

Don't kneel to a master
Hold my head upright
To kneel is to suffer and to die
Be aware of your might

When I lay me down
In madness Iï¿½ll dwell
Falling into the deep
The grounds of hell

The Pain that hurts me
Are the piercing claws of hate
The evil inside of me
Canï¿½t hide me from my fate

Shadows dancing on the wall
I have heard my suffering call
I canï¿½t hide or run away
Suffering till the end of days

I can feel the burning heat
Singeing my twisted mind
My torn and restless sleep
Salvation I canï¿½t find

Don't kneel to a master
Hold my head upright.
To kneel is to suffer and to die
Be aware of your might
