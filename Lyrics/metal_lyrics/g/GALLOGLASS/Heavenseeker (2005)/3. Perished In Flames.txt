Countless legions of highhanded prophets
Spreading fear since humanity was born

End of all days
Perished in Flames
Souls damned for eternity
But it`s not now

Countless chasms of human fantasy
Creating Horrors and nothing divine

End of all days
Perished in Flames
Souls damned for eternity
But it`s not now
And I don`t think tomorrow
Or another day in a lifetime
The end of all days

It seems to be a game
To scream the final warning

End of all days
Perished in Flames
Souls damned for eternity
But it`s not now

If someone out there is really angry
He would have destroyed us a long time before

End of all days
Perished in Flames
Souls damned for eternity
But it`s not now
And I don`t think tomorrow
Or another day in a lifetime
The end of all days

Since the day we learned to kill each other
There was a reason to make it an end

End of all days
Perished in Flames
Souls damned for eternity
But it`s not now

And for the cause it takes a longtime preparing
Weï¿½ll take the time to blow ourselves away

End of all days
Perished in Flames
Souls damned for eternity
But it`s not now
And I don`t think tomorrow
Or another day in a lifetime
The end of all days
