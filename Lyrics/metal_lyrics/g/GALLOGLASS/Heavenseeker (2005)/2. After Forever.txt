Crossing the center of nothingness
In a flowing cloak of light
The gap between alone and loneliness
Is breaking up open wide
The age is a powerful enemy
In the endless desert of time
And after even death had died
A sea of tears will give new life

On the other side
Have you found what youï¿½ve been searching for
Lay down your head and welcome to the dead
You cannot return when youï¿½ve opened the door
This is your end
The gate to the other side

Wherever the journey ends
After one million tomorrows
In vast and distant horizons
At the end of all sorrows
What once was long forgotten
Will maybe come back someday
And when the light is born again
We will return in a better way

On the other side
Have you found what youï¿½ve been searching for
Lay down your head and welcome to the dead
You cannot return when youï¿½ve opened the door
This is your end
The gate to the other side

Crossing the center of nothingness
In a flowing cloak of light
The gap between alone and loneliness
Is breaking up open wide
The age is a powerful enemy
In the endless desert of time
And after even death had died
A sea of tears will give new live

Death is everyone's destiny
In your thoughts youï¿½re creating the beyond
Death is everyone's destiny
But what youï¿½ll really see will stay unknown

Beyond all pain and sufferings
Come on and lay down your head
And say hello to the dead
On the other side

On the other side
Have you found what youï¿½ve been searching for
Lay down your head and welcome to the dead
You cannot return when youï¿½ve opened the door
This is your end
The gate to the other side
