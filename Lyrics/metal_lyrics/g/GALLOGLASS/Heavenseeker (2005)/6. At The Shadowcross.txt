Evil dreams of fire
Eating through your soul
Entering the woods
Where the fear and darkness grow
Your heart starts to pound
Misty eyes that glow
Resolutions fading
Spiritï¿½s running low

What lurks inside the deepest dark
In the forest where the shadows cross
The flaming evil that stalks the night
Meet your fears at the shadowcross

Shrieks of hellish laughter
Dance between the trees
As you grope in the dark
And nothing you can see
Your skin is pale and wet
Hope has gone from thee
Deafened by the silence
Feel what never should be

What lurks inside the deepest dark
In the forest where the shadows cross
The flaming evil that stalks the night
Meet your fears at the shadowcross

Frightened to the core
Through the fens you crawl
Confused by odd emotions
Hear the reaper call
Insane voices whisper
And the demons brawl
Closer to a breakdown
Into the black you fall

What lurks inside the deepest dark
In the forest where the shadows cross
The flaming evil that stalks the night
Meet your fears at the shadowcross
Oh, meet your fears
Between trees
At the shadowcross
