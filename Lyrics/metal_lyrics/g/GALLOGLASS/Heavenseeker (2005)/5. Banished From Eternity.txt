Drifting away into the guiding light
Into the realm of my inquiry
Good and evil are by my side
The two beings are awaiting me

They will judge your life
They will see your sins
Here on the other side
Here were your kismet grins

Itï¿½s my time for a decision
Will I belong to heaven or hell

We are sitting in a theatre
A movie plays, it shows my way
A gloomy voice sounds from afar
"Welcome to your judgement day"

Itï¿½s my time for a decision
Will I belong to heaven or hell

Weighing out what I have done
My deeds are balanced out perfectly
So Iï¿½ve to choose my way alone
To find my place for eternity

Itï¿½s my time for a decision
I make my choice between heaven or hell

[WEIRD MODERATOR (KAI):]
Congratulations ... youï¿½ve won the jackpot !!!
You can choose between
Gate one...
A low prize apartment with a high-end radiator system
Or gate two...
A cool attic flat with a fantastic view

Flattering words from the evil guide
The good appealing to my belief
Each "one" is trying to pull me on his side
Making offerings for me to seize

Itï¿½s my time for a decision
I make my choice between heaven or hell

[DEVIL (ARNIE):]
Join the dark side
The only place to be
You surely wonï¿½t regret
Prophets you will receive
Become a lord of death
Let hate flow in your veins
Tormentor of the lost souls
Master of eternal pain

Now let me tell you the truth
I am not interested in both
Maybe it's fun to exist as a ghost
So I will stay here on earth
