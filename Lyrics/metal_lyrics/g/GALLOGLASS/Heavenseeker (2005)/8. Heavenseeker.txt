In the desert of my life
I searched the wisdom well
Lugging the golden calf
Of my futile problems
The sense of human existence
The only thing in life
On a quest for salvation
Discontent was hunting me

Drowned in a sea of false prophecies
[Choir:] Tell me the way I have to go
In a world of faith I am a heavenseeker
[Choir:] Tell me the things I have to know
And Iï¿½m not alone
[Choir:] You are not alone

No one told me what to do
No one ruled my life for me
I was lost and found by myself
The path was rewarded divine
Too long I ignored the power
That flows from self-respect
The spirits I own will follow
Loyal companions on my way

Drowned in a sea of false prophecies
[Choir:] Tell me the way I have to go
In a world of faith I am a heavenseeker
[Choir:] Tell me the things I have to know
And Iï¿½m not alone
[Choir:] You are not alone

All my life I was searching
For something to adore
Power to solve my problems
A convenient ruler
I followed desolate ways
In freedom and silence
I begun to listen the winds
The voice of my inner self

Drowned in a sea of false prophecies
[Choir:] Tell me the way I have to go
In a world of faith I am a heavenseeker
[Choir:] Tell me the things I have to know
And Iï¿½m not alone
[Choir:] You are not alone
