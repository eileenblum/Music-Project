Selected for eternity
Where mighty names remain
Born to immortality
And overcome the sea of oblivion

With a crown on the head
They will lift the mourning veil
With a crown on the head
They will walk the gloomy dale

Admired and lifted to the sky
Their flame of live will die
Chosen to be kings
When they spread their wings

Kings who die
Although they live on forever
Souls drifting into the never
Theyï¿½ll last on forever
The kings who die

Songs of wisdom and brave hearts
Of great legends sang by the bards
Weï¿½ll never forget when they are gone
Immortal for the work they have done

Kings who die
Although they live on forever
Souls drifting into the never
Theyï¿½ll last on forever
Oh, kings who die

Kings who die
Although they live on forever
Souls drifting into the never
Theyï¿½ll last on forever
Oh, kings who die
