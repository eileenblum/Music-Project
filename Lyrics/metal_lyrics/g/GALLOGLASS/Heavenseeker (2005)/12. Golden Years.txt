[Bonus track]

There he sits on his throne
With burning eyes and cloven hooves
The fallen one, now alone
So far away, where his spirit moves

ï¿½Itï¿½s such a long time ago
Since the day you created man
What a circus what a show
That was the day the horror beganï¿½

[Choir:] So many years have gone
Bring back the times
[Choir:] So many things have been done
Let me live in the good old days
[Choir:] Since the good old days
[Choir:] So many years have gone
Bring back the times
[Choir:] So many things have been done
Let me live in the golden years
[Choir:] Since the good old days

ï¿½Once I was the only bad guy
But now there are billions of them
I think itï¿½s time to say goodbye
Iï¿½m just a loser compared to manï¿½

[Choir:] So many years have gone
Bring back the times
[Choir:] So many things have been done
Let me live in the good old days
[Choir:] Since the good old days
[Choir:] So many years have gone
Bring back the times
[Choir:] So many things have been done
Let me live in the golden years
[Choir:] Since the good old days

[Choir:] So many years have gone
Bring back the times
[Choir:] So many things have been done
Let me live in the good old days
[Choir:] Since the good old days
[Choir:] So many years have gone
Bring back the times
[Choir:] So many things have been done
Let me live in the golden years
[Choir:] Since the good old days
