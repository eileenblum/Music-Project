The war is over
The last battles are gone
Swords laying broken
My bloodwork is all done
I sit down for calming
My breath is lessening

Iï¿½m starting to tremble
My sight is clearing
My head is weary
A dreadful awakening
What has driven me
Into insanity

Awaking from this dreadful tragedy
I return to myself
Beginning to dwell in this elegy
Put my anger on the shelf
Awaking from this dreadful tragedy
I return to myself
Beginning to dwell in this elegy
Put my anger back on the shelf

I look around
As I raise from my rest
Discover what Iï¿½ve done
No life I have left
My heart is in pieces
My soul is laying bare

Awaking from this dreadful tragedy
I return to myself
Beginning to dwell in this elegy
Put my anger on the shelf
Awaking from this dreadful tragedy
I return to myself
Beginning to dwell in this elegy
Put my anger back on the shelf
