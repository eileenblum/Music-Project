After the smoke has left
And the fire has burned down
He leaves his hideaway
And through ashes he goes
There are just ruins left
What once was his realm
He falls on his knees
And raises his hands up high

I will remember the fire
Day of the dragon's feast
I will remember the fire
I seek to kill the beast

His burden he will bear
Oh dragon, beware of him
He will hunt you down
And for the search he leaves
For his hordes you've killed
He demands you to pay
And for the blood you've spilled
He'll strike your life away

I will remember the fire
Day of the dragons feast
I will remember the fire
I seek to kill the beast

Walking a thousand miles
Through forests, fens and thorns
Hate is gnawing at his soul
As he inquires on
How far he has to go
Will his search never end?
Until his last breath's done
He's searching on and on

I will remember the fire
Day of the dragons feast
I will remember the fire
I seek to kill the beast
