The dragon flies, on his mighty wings
Towards the walls, of the dark fortress
Bursting out in rage, cleansing fire rains
When the towers fall, nothing will remain

We will meet, eye to eye
He will pay, eye for an eye
I'll enjoy, his last cry
We will meet, eye to eye

So bittersweet, the taste of revenge
Legions of hate, decamp in fear
No chance to flee, he hounds them to death
Where is the one, he?s seeking for

We will meet, eye to eye
He will pay, eye for an eye
I'll enjoy, his last cry
We will meet, eye to eye

Close to the end, nearly all slain
Still haven't found, the king of the dark
Is he alive, or already gone
All lies in debris, he must be dead

Where is he?, eye to eye
No revenge?, eye for an eye
Have I heard?, his last cry
Where is he?, has he died
