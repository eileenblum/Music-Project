I've planned a deal with unknown mights
And hope to win no compromise
The mighty beast in front of me
That can fulfill my dreams
But I defraud the guarding beast
The keeper of this mystic tale
It banished me into my dreams
Now I've to suffer in hell

I've seen a thousands worlds before
But this one is the strangest
In front of me a gleaming stone
That once was filled with magic
In it's inscription stands
That I'll have just one chance
When the demon is gone
I can return

Now, when the demon is gone
I can return back to reality
I have just one chance to leave this legend
From now and from nevermore

My time here is running out
The beholder's getting weaker
Behind his throne the open gate
That leads to my salvation

But suddenly the demon opens his eyes
And a dreadful flash is blowing me away
My whole body is surrounded by fire
And something is dragging me deeper into this dream

Now, when the demon is gone
I can return back to reality
I have just one chance to leave this legend
From now and from nevermore
