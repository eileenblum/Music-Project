Moon is riding high in the sky, its light cannot deceive
That I'm lost here in this time, one point still far to go
To overcome eternal distance, time is running away
On my long and scary journey, to break the spell

Banished into ancient times
My destiny will never die
Follow the guiding light
Lost in a strange and foreign time

On the path I have to go, alone but not lonely
I listen to my inner voice, I trace my senses
I'm in need of company, someone to help me
To get back to my own world, to leave this land

Banished into ancient times
My destiny will never die
Follow the guiding light
Lost in a strange and foreign time

Think about the ancient times
Of a time passed by
How long will my quest last
My world?s so far away
Millions of ages in between
Will I ever get back
I'm left here on my own
Will I ever reach
The place that I call home

Banished into ancient times
My destiny will never die
Follow the guiding light
Lost in a strange and foreign time
