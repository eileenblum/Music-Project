The demon has risen again
Calling his forces to arms
In these hours of fear
We come together as well

Oooh..... together we rise

We shall unite, to overcome his domain
The dark demons force, to end his reign
We shall unite, to overcome his domain
If you join us, we will be strong again

With armor and sword at our side
We'll (hold out) against obscurity
Chasing back the clouds at the sky
We will bring back the light

Oooh..... together we rise

We shall unite, to overcome his domain
The dark demons force, to end his reign
We shall unite, to overcome his domain
If you join us, we will be strong again

Sharpen your axes and swords
And be prepared for the fight
Let's bring back freedom for all
Destroy the demon for all time

Oooh..... together we rise

We shall unite, to overcome his domain
The dark demons force, to end his reign
We shall unite, to overcome his domain
If you join us, we will be strong again
