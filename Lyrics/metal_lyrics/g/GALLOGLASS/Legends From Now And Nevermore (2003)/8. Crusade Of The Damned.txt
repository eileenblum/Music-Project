I'm on my way to look out for someone
I promise treasures and wonders to be done
To those who will follow me on my way
To kill the demon, to demand him to pay

On my way I will go - crusade of the damned
To return I will kill - crusade of the damned
On my crusade to break the demon's spell
Who will follow me to hell

No-one will follow but I have to go
They fear the demon and his deadly blow
I leave alone and I feel like I'm damned
To fight on my own, to make my last stand

On my way I will go - crusade of the damned
To return I will kill - crusade of the damned
On my crusade to break the demon's spell
Who will follow me to hell

Against the walls of the dark fortress I ride
Storming the gates of damnation
Against the walls of the dark fortress I ride
At last I am banished in time

On my way I will go
To return I will kill
On my crusade to break the demon's spell
Who will follow me to hell
