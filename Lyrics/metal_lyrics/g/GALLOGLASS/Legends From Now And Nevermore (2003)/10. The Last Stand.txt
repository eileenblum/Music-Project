At the dawn of day, two armies arise
In the morning fog, from shades of the night
Out there on the hills, they darken the sun
The last stand is here, one chance to be won

Into this raging war, out of the sun
The dragon strikes down, killing the one
Into this raging war, out of the sun
The dragon strikes down, killing the one
Burst his chest and burn his heart to ashes
At last he pays for his reign with agony
The spell breaks and the undead fall again
At the end of the day, forever victory

The undead knights, storming against the lines
The darkest hour strikes the clock of life
Thousands of men were killed, by the walking dead
At the battles end, the earth turns red

Into this raging war, out of the sun
The dragon strikes down, killing the one
Into this raging war, out of the sun
The dragon strikes down, killing the one
Burst his chest and burn his heart to ashes
At last he pays for his reign with agony
The spell breaks and the undead fall again
At the end of the day, forever victory

Into this raging war, out of the sun
The dragon strikes down, killing the one
Into this raging war, out of the sun
The dragon strikes down, killing the one
Burst his chest and burn his heart to ashes
At last he pays for his reign with agony
The spell breaks and the undead fall again
At the end of the day, forever victory
