It's written in stone... my way... my path... it leads me home...
Storming, the gate, the dragons
Storming, the gate, the dragons, gate

High above the sky, where golden dragons fly
In this mystic land, that lies beyond all time
A holy place so free, for all eternity
But in the distant fields, they see a shadow arise

Woe to the dragons - they're about to die
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they're ripped apart
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they're ripped apart

One by one they fall, hear the demons' call
He sends his legions of hate, against the dragons' light
In order to erase, eternal enemies
The land is turning red, drinking the blood of the dead

Woe to the dragons - they're about to die
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they're ripped apart
Storming the dragons' gate, the battle rages hard
Storming the dragons' gate, they?re ripped apart

After the battle is gone, there is left just one
This one was hiding while he saw the others die
When he swears revenge, hate burns in his heart
He shall never rest, until this fire is gone

Last of the dragons - seeking for revenge
Stormed was the dragons' gate, their destiny is hard
Stormed was the dragons' gate, they were ripped apart
Stormed was the dragons' gate, their destiny is hard
Stormed was the dragons' gate, they were ripped apart
