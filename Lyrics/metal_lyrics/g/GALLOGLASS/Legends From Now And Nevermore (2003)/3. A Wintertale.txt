In dark and endless nights
Fire's giving gloomy light
In the great hall we sit together
While outside the stormclouds gather
An oaken table,mighty walls
The glory circle in these halls
Listen to songs of forgotten aeons
The story of the nightmare demon

When we are gathered in the hall
They tell a wintertale
Of a time that is gone
They are singing their song

From a distance, some faint light
Coming closer, like ghosts in the night
It's a courier, and what he brings
From the darkness, are bad tidings
The evil demon, back from the dead
Darker than ever, again he spreads
Gaining force to, retaliate
Was our fight, to no avail

When we are gathered in the hall
They tell a wintertale
Of a time that is gone
They are singing their song

Hope is weakened, (our) pride is gone
It's all in vain, and nothing?s won
Fear is rising, the tide has turned
The golden future, is all burned
Feeling bitter, and crestfallen
My way home now, is stolen
Without mercy, and all our might
No surrender, we?ll take the fight

When we are gathered in the hall
They tell a wintertale
We will fight till it's won
Till the last man is gone
