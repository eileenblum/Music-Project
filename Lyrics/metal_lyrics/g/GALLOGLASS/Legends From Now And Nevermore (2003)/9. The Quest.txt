There's a secret hidden for you
Try to solve it and find out the clue
If you find out what we say
You get the story in the right way

Take your chance

Look at the stone
It's hiding the truth
Guess what the inscription is telling you
Look at the stone
It's hiding the truth
Guess what the inscription is telling you

Read the fragments in the line
And the secret you will divine
Hidden in numbers, there lies the truth
Put them in order, you have nothing to lose

Take your chance

Look at the stone
It's hiding the truth
Guess what the inscription is telling you
Look at the stone
It's hiding the truth
Guess what the inscription is telling you
