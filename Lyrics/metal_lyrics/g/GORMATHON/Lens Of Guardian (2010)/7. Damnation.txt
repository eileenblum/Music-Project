The origin of the gods engender
A breeze from heaven as we trust as our defender
Poisoning it all with our lies, betrayal

The trail of life in blindness we will fall
Along the ruins of our path and we will know
Disturbing thoughts contending, we fail

[Chorus]
Our path leads to the other side
So help me, God is my alibi
The truth to whom that we crave
The solemn promise he gave
Brightly beams his mercy to our sight
All ascending to a cloudless sky
Our journey just have started
Our door to the departed


Iâm dedicated to the fact that Iâm abandoned
A thousand years of hope, it is all gone
Trapped in the depth of universe, betrayal


The prophecy was said, the vision comes alive
The hypnotizing powers wash away the dust
One step to the truth and we know, we have failed

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Break]

[Chorus]
