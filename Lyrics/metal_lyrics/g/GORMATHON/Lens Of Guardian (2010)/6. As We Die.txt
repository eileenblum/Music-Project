Hand in hand by leaps and bounds
Out of hell of this sphere
Sacrificed we will bleed
All our pain all thru guilt

[Pre Chorus]
Persist, continue to exist
With grief in our hearts
Whoâs in control as we die
And vanish out of Hell

Behind the wall of serenity
Darkness roars of remorse
Caressed by death we will rise
Rise above our withering pride

[Pre Chorus]
Persist, continue to exist
With grief in our hearts
Whoâs in control as we die
And vanish out of Hell

[Chorus]
We are the night invaders
We are the last crusaders
As the sign appears
We vanish out of Hell

[Break]

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]
