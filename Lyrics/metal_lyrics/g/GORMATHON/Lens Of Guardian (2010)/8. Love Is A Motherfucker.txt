Change in my life, I seek to you
Ready ore not, I say I do
Living in fear, Love you so dear
The chain in my heart, Rips me apart

[Pre Chorus]
You beat the retreat
Turning around
And running away from me
And I And I I say I do

[Chorus]
Loving you are killing me you have chained my heart
Aint that a bitch, love is a motherfucker
Love is blind love is cruel it makes me cry like a fool
Aint that a bitch, love is a motherfucker

Once in my life, Right thing to do
All of my heart, Give it to you
Running away, Beg you to stay
Must be strong, Carrey it on

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Break]

And Iâ¦ And Iâ¦ I say I do

[Chorus 1.5x]
