The taste is bittersweet
I wasnât meant to be
The devils clawâs inside my mind

Donât know whatâs right or wrong
Must been away too long
Trapped in a fire deep inside

I wonât forget the pain
That makes me go insane
The wisdom fades before my eyes

I watch with great divide
The bloodstained hands of mine
Iâll suffer in a piece of mind

[Pre Chorus]
Hate â a mind in vain
Hate â end up insane

[Chorus]
Calling the one thru these angel eyes
Rise from dark as I plea
Out of the shadows I rise
Die by my hand and youâre free

A living hate â thatâs me
I wasnât meant to be
The claws are ripping me apart

Reveal my darkest thoughts
And free my mind once more
Let me regret my deadly sins

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
