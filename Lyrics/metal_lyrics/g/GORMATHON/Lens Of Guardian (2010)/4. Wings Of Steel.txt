Presence, the time has come
Blinded by the lies so far away from home
Blinded, in a daze
Finding his way back home out from the smoke

[Chorus]
With an angels heart he grow
With the spirit of a soldier and we know
He got wings, wings of steel

The new born, the chosen one, Concealed from the living
Hid from the gods, a presence of a child
An angel with wing of steel, shining in the dark
Ready to strike, a soldier in arms

[Chorus]
With an angelâs heart he comes
With the last appeal
The spirit of this soldier grows
Strong with wings of steel

A master in the sky, an angel, a soldierâs son
He comes with pride and glory, preparing heaven for war
Crawling in the dark, searching for the truth
Opening the doors of fear, towards the unknown

[Chorus]

[Break]
The battle will start as we hear
Cries in the darkness of fear
Demons yell every were

Donât disparage the strength of a prayer
The glory of truth in its glare
As the sign will appear

[Solo]
[Chorus]
