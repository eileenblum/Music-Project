The morning rises, the night are swept away
I am the rider of the sky
Our troupes are gathered, the demon soon will pay
We will continue 'til we die

[Pre Chorus]
Led by a mighty king weâre always standing tall
âProtect and serveâ the tale that we have heard
The grief and agony will only make us strong

[Chorus]
Oh guardian set me free
No more pain and misery
Always fighting side by side
Cause weâre the riders of the sky

On armoured wings we fly loud and clear we hail
Weâll conquer land and sea today
The god of thunder roars, never will he fail
Eternal fire in our way

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
