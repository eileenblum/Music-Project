As evil ramifies you and I must die
As the darkness falls light devours by hate
Disgracefully the end of the world
Inherently evil night is black as hearts are dark

[Pre Chorus]
I se it all thru the lens of Guardian
No way to hide who will win whom will fall
Glazing thru the lens of Guardian
We will meet in any shape at all

[Chorus]
Ooohâ¦ Ooohâ¦ Ooohâ¦

Destruction of assault, Provider of abuse
Time merely disappears as light and dark diverge

Leap in the dark Iâll give Iâll sacrifice
Gloried in its wrath the darkness pity me
Moreâs the pity as I call to arms
A clash encounter to the greater glory of God

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Break]
[Solo]

Never ending game never ending pain
Light and dark diverged all will fall
Iâll give Iâll sacrifice, time to go to war
A clash encounter to the greater glory of God

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
