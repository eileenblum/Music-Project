Rising from oppression like a spectre on the wall
Infected by the strain of life
In this time constraints confined a life in black
Reunited with the pack

Suffering in delusion perished by the fall
Chanting as them all I hear
Accede to the demands suffering in truth
Interpreted as fear

[Pre Chorus]
Derail, Betrayal, Devoured by penalty of death
Derail, Betrayal,

[Chorus]
Loss of guilt embrace the truth by entering the fear
Marble orchard the final ground I see the tears of the sun

Reversing life to death although nothing gained
Darkness adorn the sky
Silence everlasting following the truth
As we obey

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Break]
Iâm the voice in your head
Iâm here for you as you confess
From the dead I am the fear
Your only way out of here

Your anger thrives till you confess you seek and you will find
The marble orchard the final ground

[Chorus 2x]
