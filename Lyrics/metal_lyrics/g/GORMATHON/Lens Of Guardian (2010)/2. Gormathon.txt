I am the persuader of fear and respect
The slaughter of souls with the power to reach into your nightmare
The demons will rise, the anger will wake
You know Iâm the master of raging and hate and disaster

[Chorus]
I know weâll meet again
And you will pay my cravings
Then you will see, my friend
I reach into your nightmare

I suffer through madness and draining my wrath
The pain will continue as long as my path isnât changing
I show no regret, Iâm the struggle within
My mind wonât set free, I live with my sin forever

[Chorus]
I know weâll meet again
And you will pay my cravings
Then you will see, my friend
I reach into your nightmare

[Solo]

I am
Gormathon

[Chorus]
I know weâll meet again
And you will pay my cravings
Then you will see, my friend
I reach into your nightmare
