In darkness and destruction, my path is long to stay
Led into temptation, Iâll bring salvation and pain
Everything is said and done, I give a choice to everyone
I am the one, I am the truth, I lead you out of this abuse

[Pre Chorus]
Prowess in the battle shows, whoâs the worthy whoâs to go
The gates of hell are open, I pray for strength

[Chorus]
A dense blanket of darkness and fear cries in the night
Everything is said and done weâre up to a fight
Cries of fear weâre catching the wind cries in the night
Everything is said and done weâre up to a fight

Aftermath of Adoration, Aftermath of Adoration

Imprisoned in a pit in hell, I seek the darkness where you dwell
I open doors, I hear you pray, in the night Iâll find the way
I go thru pain and misery, Iâm in the shadows and youâll se
Iâll take you home as you remain unknown youâve been insane

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus 1.5x]

Aftermath of Adoration

[Solo]

A dense blanket of darkness and fear cries in the night
Everything is said and done weâre up to a fight

Close your eyes and smile to your fear
Fight for freedom, now and I hear

A dense blanket of darkness and fear cries in the night
Everything is said and done weâre up to a fight
Cries of fear weâre catching the wind cries in the night
Everything is said and done weâre up to a fight

Aftermath of Adoration
