Through the fields of destruction, the trail of pain
Into a blast of evil, by dint of faith
Among the desecrated, with pride we call
A journey through our pain, still standing tall

[Chorus]
Absence of trust, we shall go back
Into the chamber of doom
A silent call, foray in hell
And in trust we gain

Into the storm of darkness, set once again
We're lined up all together, a strive in vain
The troops of evil forces, fearless in death
Pinned to the doors of hell, to take our breath

[Pre Chorus]
Tears of feign, we fall and we rise again
We pay with our lives, with our blood, with our souls
And nothing we gain

[Chorus]
Absence of trust, we shall go back
Into the chamber of doom
A silent call, foray in hell
And in trust we gain

[Solo]

[Pre Chorus]
Tears of feign, we fall and we rise again
We pay with our lives, with our blood, with our souls
And nothing we gain

[Chorus]
Absence of trust, we shall go back
Into the chamber of doom
A silent call, foray in hell
And in trust we gain
