Join me...
I'm listing to these horrifying whispers in the wind
Voices saying to beware, war closing in
Soon it says it will break through with cravings too abstruse
Death will come in its path, it comes for me and you

[Choir]

I raise my fist to justify, relentlessly I stay
To fight this war with dignity till nothing's left to gain
With all my trust and all my faith, now I urge to you
Walk with me to hell and back, through this stream of woe

[Choir]

[Chorus]
Enlighten evilness, the black sun rises
We're trapped by the hands of the warlords of doom
Cold blood flows through our veins
As we walk through the fire of fight
The warlords of doom

Warlords from the underground now ascends the stairs
From the darkness to our world we huddle in despair
Squealing secret rites of doom, we don't stand a chance
We've just been invited to the devils dance

[Solo]

[Chorus]
