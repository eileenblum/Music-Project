I'm melting my body, just disappears
I'm lost and I'm fading away
Something is holding a grip of me
I stare in its eyes, and its fury is me

"I'm looking down the abyss and it doesn't make sense
Liaise with thy mind and remember my name"

A quietly intense approach
at the behest of the dead

[Pre chorus]
Staid in my mind

[Chorus]
Raised by the sage from the kingdom of heaven
Destined to walk in the darkness of hell
Sadness and tears, it all comes back to you

Due to atrocious reminisce of days gone by
I'll show my obeisance to the dark
I salute the demon I've become
My devilish shape is my camouflage

"I'm looking down the abyss and it doesn't make sense
Liaise with thy mind and remember my name"

You're bringing me all this pain
Yet I'll sanctify thy name

[Pre chorus]
Staid in my mind

[Chorus]
Following my destiny in my pledge to you
Defiantly I'll do the work that no one else will do
Relentlessly endure everything that's in my way
What's lurking in the shadows, I shall find and I shall stay

[Solo]

[Chorus]
