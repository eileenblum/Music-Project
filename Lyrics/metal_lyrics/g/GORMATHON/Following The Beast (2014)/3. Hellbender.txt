Ascending from the realm of doom
In the beat to the devil's choir
Patronizing all of you
I'm the fruit of all your lies

I am the night, I am the dark
That you always will fear
You're drowning in my hungering eyes
In my soul from darker sphere

Emptiness you'll find, I'm near
Ground will tremble fast as you hear
Children's scream is loud in pain
Darkness calling out
Through the Hellbender night

I am back from the fire
Retribution is calling my name
In the darkness you'll hear
A serenade of doom in the silence

Precognition, a warning
Still I'm lost but my visions is clear
Echoes of evil surmounted
Through the Hellbender night

Beside the slain and tortured
Who's crawling from my grave
Altered and disfigured creatures
Struggle to be saved

Through the ruins of divine
I shall rise again
You can see the world is turning
To your chagrin pain

Emptiness you'll find, I'm near
Ground will tremble fast as you hear
Children's scream is loud in pain
Darkness calling out
Through the Hellbender night

I am back from the fire
Retribution is calling my name
In the darkness you'll hear
A serenade of doom in the silence

Precognition, a warning
Still I'm lost but my visions is clear
Echoes of evil surmounted
Through the Hellbender night

[Solo]

I am back from the fire
Retribution is calling my name
In the darkness you'll hear
A serenade of doom in the silence

Precognition, a warning
Still I'm lost but my visions is clear
Echoes of evil surmounted
Through the Hellbender night
