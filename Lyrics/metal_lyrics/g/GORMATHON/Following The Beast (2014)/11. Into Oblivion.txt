[Bonus Track]I don't remember where I've been
Nothing is real but the pain that I feel
My body is throbbing and my soul is torn
Of darkness and evil inside my head
Aligned with insanity barely awake
In obscurity of my whereabouts
Yet I choose my allegiance to you
In dubiety of the right thing to do
No matter who we are, no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say, no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
The night has fall and you're pulling my strings
As an allied in death, as a voice from within
In mind and sense I hate what you are
A reflection of life, and the hate that it brings
But a glint of hope perceived by my sense
Like a smile on a face, I couldn't ask for more
It makes me contented and staid to my call
The ordeal in life is a journey for all
No matter who we are, no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say, no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter who we are, no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say, no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter who we are, no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say, no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
