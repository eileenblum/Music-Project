One way, one will, one life
I'll pay the price
I walk through dark dimensions
Enslaved to my pain
Bound to walk through time
In rage and fury

[Pre Chorus]
My weakness I shall know
And stronger I shall grow

[Chorus]
I listen to the beat of my heart
My way, my time
It's time to break the chains
Following the beast from within
My will, my life
It's time to break the chains
One chance, one step, one move
Beyond all my pain
In trust and understanding
Staid to my fate
Set to go as only I remain

[Pre Chorus]
My weakness I shall know
And stronger I shall grow

[Chorus]
I listen to the beat of my heart
My way, my time
It's time to break the chains
Following the beast from within
My will, my life
It's time to break the chains

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I listen to the beat of my heart
My way, my time
It's time to break the chains
Following the beast from within
My will, my life
It's time to break the chains
