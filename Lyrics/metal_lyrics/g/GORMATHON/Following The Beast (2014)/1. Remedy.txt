These lies that we're in is written in our blood
We break it down, break it down
By trail of man, the blood on our hands
by grasp and evil

[Pre Chorus]
Secrets from within is hidden in the past
wittingly by lies
today we shall die...

Eliciting the dark just to bring it down
the bring it down, bring it down
the torture and pain, the dark that bind you
let it guide you

[Pre Chorus]
Secrets from within is hidden in the past
wittingly by lies
today we shall die...

[Chorus]
as our lives fading away along the fire in our eyes
By the truth, through the lies, entering the fear
Entering evil
As our lives fading away along the fire in our eyes
Live and die, keen to the fight, eliciting the dark
Remedy in heart

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Remedy in heart, dauntless together
Eliciting the dark, when the gates are open
Struggle through pain, force and torture
the valorous way, now this day is over
