You've entered my sanctum, and why may I ask
I'll wrap you up in fear
You paragon of chivalry alone in my dark
Devoted to your tears

[Pre Chorus]
I'm calling you out, assign to me
Into my rage, as one we shall be

[Chorus]
All your powers are mine I shall watch you go blind
In my darkness celestial warrior

You don't know who I am, you don't know me at all
Still you call my name
I'm the evil you fear in the dark as you hear
The answers to your prayer

[Pre Chorus]
I'm calling you out, assign to me
Into my rage, as one we shall be

[Chorus]
All your powers are mine I shall watch you go blind
In my darkness celestial warrior

[Solo]

[Pre Chorus]
I'm calling you out, assign to me
Into my rage, as one we shall be

[Chorus]
All your powers are mine I shall watch you go blind
In my darkness celestial warrior
I'm the master of this land I'm the master of the hand
On your shoulder celestial warrior
