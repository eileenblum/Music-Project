Contorted souls imprisoned me
I'll face them strong, I'll make them see
And by my hand I'll carve their minds
In wrath I'll mold them into one

Deceived, betrayed, by the renegade
Caress the breath of death and hate
I'll blaze the trail, I'll sacrifice
I'll kill the pain, I'll kill the lies

[Chorus]
Abundance of divine wrath upon thy soul
In benevolence, a truth, a death in vain, a truth so frail
Well concealed lies, trust is forfeit
Soiled along your glorious pride

Bereaved is loss I will start my vengeance
And seek the truth of my heart
All the hatred which tears my soul
Fuels the carnage, I will wreck

[Chorus]

[Choir / Solo]

[Chorus]
