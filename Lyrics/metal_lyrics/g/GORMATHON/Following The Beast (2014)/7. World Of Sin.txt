The worst of your dreams is what will befall
Amidst the hatred you walk
The bringer of death is the bringer of truth
Dazed to the shadows you fall

[Pre Chorus]
I'll make you beg, I'll see you bleed, I'll help you die
Words of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart

[Chorus]
The time is here and I'm calling from my world of sin
Deep from the dark I'll be crawling bent to rise again

The desecrated powers will bring
The sound of hate I pursues
You know who I am and where I will be
Solace you'll find in the truth

[Pre Chorus]
I'll make you beg, I'll see you bleed, I'll help you die
Words of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart

[Chorus]
The time is here and I'm calling from my world of sin
Deep from the dark I'll be crawling bent to rise again

[Choir]

[Chorus]
The time is here and I'm calling from my world of sin
Deep from the dark I'll be crawling bent to rise again
