[Bonus Track]A silent walk to eternity, elated on my way
One step at a time, closer to my grave
Evil lurking for my soul, but I am not afraid
Moving strong towards, the endings of my days
Never looking back, never mourn of what's lost
My time is closing in, and it's time to move on
My heart of choice sets me free, I am flying high
Here I'll be waiting
Don't you forget what it means, by a silent walk
Into the eternity
Traces in time, of what once was mine
It all has blow away for something new
All the pain is gone, all is left behind
Life has passed me by, I'm marching into next
Never looking back, never mourn of what's lost
My time is closing in, and it's time to move on
My heart of choice sets me free, I am flying high
Here I'll be waiting
Don't you forget what it means, by a silent walk
Into the eternity
My heart of choice sets me free, I am flying high
Here I'll be waiting
Don't you forget what it means, by a silent walk
Into the eternity
