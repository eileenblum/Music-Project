I feel a manic obsession
Let me suffer and I'll obey you
Sweet torment caresses my lust
I'm a servant to whatever hurts
Self-destruction, beloved enemy
Self-destruction, beyond remedy
Pain holds me down but my spirit awakes
Lament and gloom feed the demon within
The scars in my flesh
reflect the scars in my soul
Thanatomiania, a secret suicide
Self-destruction, beloved enemy
Self-destruction, beyond remedy
Self-destruction, master of disharmony
Self-destruction, mirrored through misanthropy
Misery is precious treasure
It makes my dead soul feel alive
Calamity is my only pleasure
In a world so cold nothing's worth to strive
I feel severed from this life,
I feel severed from god's creation
The moment of death will be my rescue
nothingness heals all wounds
Oblivion is my benediction
the loss of life my greatest gift
The blood that runs out of my veins
makes me calm
For the first time in my life
I feel satisfied
Eradicate my mortality
release me into eternity
