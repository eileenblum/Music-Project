We drown in the deception of daylight
Blinded by this shallow life
its lucid fruition that we strive
we long for dark illumination
Emerging from the shadows
where life is always pure
we wander dormant paths
of sunless and mournful days
Waiting for the era of rising wisdom
we are assembling unseen forces in the haze
We rise in the purity of the nightfall
Embraced by darkness
all our will through ancient forces is fulfilled
We reign in dark illumination
Darkness -  ultimate perception
The essence of all the things we reach
Countless treasures can be found
Spirits of the night will teach
