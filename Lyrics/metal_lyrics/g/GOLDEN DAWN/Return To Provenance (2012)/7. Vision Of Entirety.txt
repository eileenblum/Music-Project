A timeless moment of now
brushes away the tears from the past
A state of crystalline clarity
brings back my inner entirety
A silent yet deep understanding
speaks with words without meaning
The universe and I
are floating in eternal patterns
The mirror of self reflection has burst
Perception trespassed all borders
The awakening of the third eye
connects me to the cosmic strings
When all earthly boundaries end
begins my vision of entirety
I am dead but immortal
I am dreaming myself to life
I am all and all is me
Creation has fulfilled
In a state of dissolution
when despair becomes my mind
in a moment of crushing pain
my earthly life ends
