See the one encircled in the bloody shambles
Her eyebeam rigid
her whole body trembles
Oh lustful stranded slut
go on and never stop
Defiant and keen
she took the opaque pill of rapture
Inebriant venom enriched her horny blood
A hot blooded bitch
moans with uttermost pleasure
Predetermined for destructive self immolation
Oh fucking naive bitch
you are the one we ditch
Lecherous breathing
Dionysian Eucharist
The air turns sultry as her dance gets faster
A sweat dripping body
in elusive ecstasy jubilantly passes away
In self destructive glory
her knees start trembling
as she wettens her pearl thong
No girls for the ring
but a death worshipping cunt
Dionysian Eucharist
the ecstasy of lust and death
Dionysian Eucharist
no feeling for life but through pain
See the devout feast of self-sacrifice
in the name of flesh lust and death
An out drying vixen exhaling her last breath
Encircled by the votaries of ruin and submission
There is no end beyond all boundaries
in the realm of death's recognition
Driven by ominous beats
forced to dance herself to death
For entrancement and the pleasure of pain
