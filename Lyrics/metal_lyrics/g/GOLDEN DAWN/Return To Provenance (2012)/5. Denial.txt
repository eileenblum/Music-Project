Beyond all boundaries of earth reaches the soul
on wings of imagination
My fervent longing climbs to distant spheres
Earth-bound but gazing at the stars I feel my disease
Restrictive is the cage of the cold material world
Emotions are withered in the desert of mediocrity
Pureness tainted by a putrid surface
Embers within no longer burn
The brothership of low-leveled thoughts corrupts
my spirit and soul
In a world of perhaps and may nothing is real
The brothership murmurs
"Obey or take your life away"
Beyond all boundaries of earth reaches the curse
of collective deception
A mournful longing remains
The wind keeps on whispering of stories untold
A lonely soul against the pain of the world
A feeble voice breaks off in the choir of denial
