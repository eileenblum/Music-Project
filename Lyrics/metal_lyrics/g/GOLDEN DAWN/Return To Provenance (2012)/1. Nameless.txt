Nameless incarnation of hatred
No reason to live
but to cause discord and pain
I bear the mark of the fallen one
Touch me and be cursed
Love me and be enslaved
Join me and be damned
Trust me and be forgotten
There is no rest within my soul
A cold indifference distorts my aura
On the path that I wander
there is no equilibrium
Witness the fire of my hatred
It exhausts the souls of the guilty ones
Guilty for their prideless daze
I donate you nothing but scorn
embrace you with wings of indifference
desecrate you with a serpent's kiss
redeem you into the void  of oblivion
