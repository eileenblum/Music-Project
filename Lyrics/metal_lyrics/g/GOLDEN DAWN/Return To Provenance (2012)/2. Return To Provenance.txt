On the ruins of creation
Dying promethic embers
turn the world into darkness
There is no bright wisdom
no place for self control
without a link to our true nature
Return to provenance
Realize, internalize
this world is built on mire and rot
Worshipping idols, wasting breath
blind from self-deception
Denying the instinct turns us away
from the creation as it was meant to be
Strive against the grasp of the demon-self
Within lies all enlightenment
So don't be a fool and realize
that it's not you that ponders
moans and falls down in weakness
The pain of the world weighs on your shoulders
It's not your sorrow, it's not your soul
Don't believe in anything but in your self-control
Command and navigate the ship to the open sea
