You are out in the cold night, inside my magic desert realm 
Fright is your guide 
Spirits, astral entities, yet common sense you overwhelms 
You flee and do not see 

You are save but small inside your reason-moulded world 
I'll make you fall, out of yourself you will be hurled 

Demons wander, souls materialize, now you can't explain 
No more time for lies! 
You've crossed the border where all words end 
Only yesterday you said it was nothing but the wind... 

There is so much between heaven and earth 
How can you declare that it has no worth 
The tyrant within you is your only hint 
He makes you believe that it's all nothing but the wind
