Cast into a life I don't want to live 
The way of Tonal has nothing to give 
Narrow is your horizon, your reason's border 
I step beyond your deceptive order 

You rest in the eye of a raging storm 
And think that the world is safe and warm 
But the surges of death erode your isle of peace 
And will extinguish your flicker when life has ceased 

I won't remain hiding in the cave where shadows dance 
Only the lightning of magic the distortion ends 
The storm, it rages but when my time has come I won't fade away 
The powers of Nagual sorcery are here to stay
