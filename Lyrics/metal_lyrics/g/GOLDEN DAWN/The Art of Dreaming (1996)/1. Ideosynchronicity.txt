Deep in the corners of your innermost dreams 
Chaos is order and nothing as it seems 
You gather with reason and rational brain 
But these weapons remain blunt, you are slowly getting insane 

A trip between galaxies and black holes 
Is what one can experience inside one's soul  
The projection of cosmos makes up every cell 
Not outside but inwards we should dwell 

Above is as below, the ideosynchronicity is the secrecy 
I've finally understood that outside is but a shadow  
Of what is inside of me 

If one dreams his dream alone it is all his own 
Hallucinating fantasy 
The way we all dream at day and ourselves betray 
Is called reality
