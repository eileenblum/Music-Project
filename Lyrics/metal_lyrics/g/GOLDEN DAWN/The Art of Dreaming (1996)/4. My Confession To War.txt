I've drowned in peace for so many years 
Raping my human nature with thousand worthless tears 
I kneeled before the throne of self-pityness 
Now I dwell in unpersonal darkness 

I resort to the sword and its supreme law 
Confess to a way of life genuine and raw 
Existence is battle and battle is my life 
Timidity shall fade, the strong survive  

Deny the word and worship the deed 
Only action into freedom leads! 
Mind is the source of creativity 
But the sword has to eradicate what used to be
