There is a pot of gold unveiled at the rainbow's end 
If you keep fighting on you'll find the promised land 
He who is strong in mind and has the will to run free 
Beyond horizons he might glance as servant of fantasy 

Hold my hand and realize that you are the one 
Feel the power, the quest has just begun 

Show me the way to where dragons reign 
The forest of myths behind the sea 
Beyond this rainy day sunlight will guide 
And dreamwings will carry me 

On the path of glory the proud and strong will never fall 
So take your stand and hear the wizard's call
