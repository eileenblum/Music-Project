Atop the hill, facing the nightfall 
Birds of ill omen are sending me scorn 
My heart has stopped aching 
Like a skull in a coffin my soul is resting within 
Unborn ... 

In his kingdom of thorns I am one with his horns 
Run, baby, run - I am Satans son 
For me all love is dead 
And the tears that I shed ... 
Wasted seeds of despair I no longer care 

Insane misanthropy is striking my mind 
Malicious contempt for all mankind 
Murder and suffering I evoke 
Gory like a berserk and as steady as an oak 

I walk my path in silence 
Crossing pain and violence 
Beholding you without a sound 
Man, a tool of evil unbound
