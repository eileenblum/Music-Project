Ten times a thousand years ago 
The gods from the stars came below 
Completed the creation of man 
The time of progress began 

Superior knowledge familiar to us 
Is regaining power from Sirius or Mars 

Once, when the 12th planet crashed with the earth 
A great flood drowned human wisdom and mirth 

Only few survived the tragedy 
All remains where dragged across the sea 

Encoded in all fairy-tales and myths 
The heritage of the ancient ones still lives 

Tomorrow's dreams are memories from the past 
The cosmic principles will everlast 
But mystified fragments won't turn the page 
Distorted echoes from the age of Atlantis 

Ignorance is all I can see 
Dumbness our true entity 
Time is not ripe for enlightenment 
We can't use the key in our hand
