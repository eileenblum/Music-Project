I can't stand that hypnotizing masquerade that is draining me 
Synchronizing brains and feelings 
Paralyzing fantasy 

Where is the sense behind this illusion? 
Slaves to machines can't stop the confusion 

My eyes are blent 
They won't repent ursurping the dominion of my mind 
Truth mixed with lies, fools' paradise 
Drifting through their maze of hollow worlds 

This is the final tragedy 
The revelation in front of me 
Now I can see the link to where worlds are born 
There is no truth after all 
It is on you... 
Master or slave... 

Masquerade is no disguise 
There are no gods in empty skies 
Man creates what man's world is 
No one is there for my release
