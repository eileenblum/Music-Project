Are all those frightening colours real 
And not just fantasy? 
Is this the day of my good-bye? 
Illusions in my head reflecting painful memory 
A message from a hostile sky 

I walked alone in the darkest night  
The cold bleak stars a lonely light  
Countless lifetimes I was looking for 
The way that leads me to the open door 

My misery is dust in your wind 
Behind reality where fate is spinned 
Your presence is fathomless grey  
Reaping your harvest like a beast of prey 

In pain I have surrendered the fight 
With tears I crawled in the horrible night 
My bleeding world is timelessly vain 
Your void inside leads a macabre reign 

God has been lieing  
Cause now as I'm dying 
The chorus of angels is fading away 
The end of my story is not filled with glory 
Alone in the dark I am banished to stay 

Banished to stay...
