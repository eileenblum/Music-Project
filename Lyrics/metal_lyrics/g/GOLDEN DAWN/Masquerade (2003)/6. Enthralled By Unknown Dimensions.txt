Like Phoenix rising from the Ashes of despair 
I burned the bridges behind me 
No more compulsions to declare 
Why I always left the way fate paved for me 
To my dark dreams 
Subreality trespassed? 

Enthralled by unknown dimensions 
Entwined in cryptic cocoon 
Follow me to a new paradigm 
For the end is coming so soon 

Tenebrae mortis 
Itio sortis 
Amentia vitae 
Matronarum terrae 

The beast's grotesque face  
My inner divine whore 
Turned rigid like Medusa's eyes 
Stone-cold apathetic gore
