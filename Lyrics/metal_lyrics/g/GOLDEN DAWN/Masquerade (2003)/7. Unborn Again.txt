Deep inside I wonder why 
There is a secret called I 
A silent voice that makes me suffering 
And forms reality 

Why am I and not forever unborn? 
Body and mind... 
Between the worlds they are torn 

What does not kill you makes you stronger 
But will I be strong enough to kill myself? 
Full of longing for the end to come 
No more suffering from the wounds of time 

When I was born and did not know 
Of black and white nor where to go 
No self was the burden of my mind 
My body left the world behind 

Imagination - truth formed by visions 
Alienation - misled decisions 

Unborn again... 
Beginning to end... 

He who left the self behind  
Ascends to higher spheres of mind 
Individuality released into entirety
