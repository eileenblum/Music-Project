In the silence of heaven's pride 
The gates of love where opened wide 
Darkness in harmony with light 
Day just the shadow of night 

Beautiful face in deadly embrace 
Fallen from grace... 

You are my dark star from dimensions afar 
Dusk and dawn you merge 
Waters are deep where lost feelings sleep 
You are the end of my search 

You are my angel... 

The tide it did turn 
Every angel must burn in the wake of enlightenment 
When divinity dies see another one rise 
To set our yearning souls free 

Fallen kings... 
Shadows wandering in the night 
Holy fires burning bright 
Broken wings... 
Evil conquered paradise 
Angels getting hypnotized
