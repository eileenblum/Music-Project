It's been a long time
Such a long time coming
But here we are now, here we are
At this moment

We measure days by dreams and sometimes flowers
Time eludes us without notion of surrender
No surrender

Look toward the sea, always toward the sea

Look toward the sea as you touch our warm skin, they are perfect
Love is.
Look toward the sea as you kiss our warm skin, you will know that
Love is.

Love is.
