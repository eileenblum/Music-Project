Memories crack and fade to dust
They are the barren land you walk upon
Where the sun beats, the dead tree and dry stone offer no relief
Step by step, there are no tears left, not even the comfort of them dry on your face
Leave them, leave these burdens for your dreams
Dreams crack and fade to dust
They are the barren land you walk upon
Right foot, left, there's no one left but you to piece them back one by one
Leave them, leave these burdens for your dreams

So long is this lifetime, today
So then let me rest my weary head for a night
But the ghosts, they stay
'Don't close your eyes,' they say
'Don't close your eyes, stay awake'

Don't close your eyes
Don't go to sleep
Don't close your eyes
For in your dreams you'll find you had love
You'll see that you've lost
You'll know that you've killed in this world
