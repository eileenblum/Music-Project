Little Wheel spin and spin
Big Wheel turn round and round

But not for you
Never for you
And each time you forget the last time
So just for you
Only for you
Each time is the first time
We've left the stage
We all turn the page
This grand show goes on without us

Wandering boy, wandering for so long
Don't you know, we may never find our way home
