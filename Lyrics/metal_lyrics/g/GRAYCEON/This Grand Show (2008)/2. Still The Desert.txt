Wandering boy, wandering for so long
Don't you know we may never find our way home

Look, it's the sea!
Wait, no, that's still the desert...
Look closely and you'll see we are blinded by that which we seek
Go on, go onward, dear
I can't convince you otherwise
No one can convince you otherwise, leave me behind

One last thought before you let me go...
I hope it was worth what you may find
Worth all your loneliness and casualties
Me, I'll be just fine, for we both know...

There are other worlds than these
So not an end, but the end of the beginning
