Ride the white line
The hot wind in our hair
Ride the white line
Together we roll, now and forever

Now and forever we should...
Ride the white line
The hot wind in our hair
Ride the white line
Together we roll, now and forever
We ride

Pedal on
Pedal on
Pedaling on with me can set us both free

Remember when we gazed into sunsets
The golden light shone in our eyes
Remember when we lay in fields of grass
The heavy hours hung in our eyes
Remember when we stood in pouring rain
The tears from the sky filled our eyes
Remember when we had to...

Pedal on
Pedal on
Pedaling on with me can set us both free
