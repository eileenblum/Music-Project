The rain, it hits our window
Like rapid fire on our hearts
Torrential and never-ending
As though to tear us apart

When will it ever end
Everything comes to an end
So we can leave it all to hands of fate
We can lose it all

The sky, weeping still
Sings a sweet lullaby
Asleep in our arms
We can always dream the sun

When will it ever end
Everything comes to an end
So we can leave it all to hands of fate
We can lose it all
So we can hold each other as close as we can
And still lose it all
We can lose it all
We can lose it all
We can lose it all

All together, fly to the sky
Fly to the rainbow
Fly people fly
Fly people fly
