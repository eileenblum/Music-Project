[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Brave you are, but still - you're useless,
they know of your dreams, your searches,
when it must be done, it's your turn,
fade you may if fail to sky high.

We will use our magical instincts,
we will cross the time and the space,
hope to find the warden diamond,
hope to find the origin, the truth.

Leave all your fears behind,
search for the being inside.
It will know what you seek to find,
it's just you, it's in your mind.

It's in your mind.

Go and use your magical instincts
on a quest to bring the holy truth.
Fly to warden diamond and visit
the four connected as if they are one.

One looks as paradise,
one looks like hell in ice.
One looks as pillar of eyes,
one looks at you trough it's skies.

I'm caught now in the unknown
tracing the blood of the stone.

The blood of the stone..
Is in the unknown..
The blood of the stone...
The blood of the stone!
