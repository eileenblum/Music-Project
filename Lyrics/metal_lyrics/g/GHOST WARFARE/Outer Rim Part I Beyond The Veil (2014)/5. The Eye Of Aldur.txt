[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

A stone. an orb of power.
A stone...

That stone - Aldur's eye.
That stone, now it's MINE!

Aaarrrgggh, it burns,
to hold this stone forever!
It hurts, I'm not so pure, I'm better!

His stone, a light of God.
His stone.. Why... Why?

That stone, a will of fire.
That stone, my.. desire!

Aaaarrgggh, the flames,
the lights, the heat, the pyre!
Can't.. hold.. Meant for a god, I'm HIGHER!

This bond destroying me,
the eye won't close, it's free!

The stone, the orb of power.
The stone..

That stone, Aldur's eye.
That stone, forever.. mine..

With me! Now I can clearly see.
With me! I'm not free!

Why me?! The stone devoured me!
Why me?! I Was a fool!
