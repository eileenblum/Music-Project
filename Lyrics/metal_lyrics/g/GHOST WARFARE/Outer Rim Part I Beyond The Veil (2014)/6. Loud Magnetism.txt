[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Can you hear them? Can you see them?
Still you fear them and you're living..

Foul life, mere existence,
death waves crushing your spiritual side.

Blade of the fallen one twisted,
poised to strike at command.
Silent screams of the gifted,
their brains failing and
hope with them surely dies.

How could one decide,
before their eyes,
a way to hide, remain in wait
and live the end.

Morbid fashions distinctive,
drawing reason and sight.
Old ways gone extinctive -
hold on, majesty,
why don't you wait for your prize?

Slaves marching proud
on holy ground.
Blindly they stare,
but could not bare
to face the glare.

Accursed feed,
out of machine.
Disrupting sound,
inside, around.

Burnt from inside,
nothing to hide,
like was foretold
you sold your souls
for useless gold.

As the end neared,
they felt nervous, they feared.
Deep, in their every cell,
they knew, it was.. hell.
