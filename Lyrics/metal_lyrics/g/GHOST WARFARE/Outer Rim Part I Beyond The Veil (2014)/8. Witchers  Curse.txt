[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

A witcher -
professional monster slayer.

Sin and fear.

Sword? Sure!
And one for men.

Blood?! Yours!
But they were slain.

You shined your light
to expose their foul lies.
Hidden in shades
were the flesh tainting crimes.

Cold and devoted your logic is pure.
Bound by the oath you cleanse them like a cure.

Religious doubts..
Harsh.. believes.
Pitiful crowd..
Day of fear.

Who is their king?
Rise, to hear!
Take a part...
Choose a side - nor wrong, nor right.

Out, children of night,
and visions of blight are..
.. calling you, calling you, step out, it's near.

Thought (that) you could evade, and live without hate..
.. never take sides on maters of men!

With you, or without,
it's always about,
picking a side,
for money, or pride.

Money or pride!
Their nature is blind.
Fight them or die..
Fight them or die!
