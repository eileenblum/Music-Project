[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Take him down, brake his crown.

Cry, my sovereign,
you're stripped from the divine!
Try ordering
the ones you've left behind!

You owe your lives to my kin.
Do you know what we've sacrificed to come this far?

This insurgence waged against me,
marks.. your.. own.. fall.

Die, my sovereign,
it's who will obey!
In here, in this labyrinth,
of pleasures and decay!

These world are not of your mind.
Fed with lies you seek to your only chance.

The one who has promised freedom
will.. make.. you.. bow.

They burned the lands to hunt me,
there's nothing left to do, I must depart at once.

The gate leads to hidden kingdoms
where.. I.. shall.. hide.

Left to rot and fester,
the human kingdoms,
soon became the hearth of depravity.
With the walls of order - crumbled,
and sanity - replaced by primeval needs.
