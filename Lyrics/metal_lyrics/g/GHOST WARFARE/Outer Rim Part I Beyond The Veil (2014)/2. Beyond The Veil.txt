[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Great Mulin Arch, father of land.

Make the ground collide,
rise mountains high and
scratch the northern sky
to light the fire of (life).

Great Mulin Arch, father of land.

There, down below,
the Earth is raging,
time begins to flow
the Gods are fading, Oh..

They must find a way to come with me
across the vast, endless sea.

Million lights retold forgotten tales
preserve the land beyond the..

Great Mulin Arch, father of land.

Down, below your sight,
your suns are raving,
mother Earth will cry
for they will all soon die.

They must find a way to come with me
Across the vast, endless sea.

Million lights retold forgotten tales
preserve the land beyond the.. Veil!

And they ventured forth...

Bright shining spheres,
simple and clear.
Still can recall when they
all went away.

Bright shining spheres,
simple and clear.
Read in their truthful glare,
find the true heir.

Reborn into existence.
senses froze in persistence.
what could have happened here?
to make them.. disappear?

Having set their gaze
upon the stars.
They red the past
and future wars.

A scent of doubt
disrupted the stream,
a massive disturbance,
an almighty scream.
The pain was so strong
and yet to be seen,
that it echoed across,
as if always have been.
The illusion of time
convulsed and then shattered,
an essence divine
torn apart from it's matter.

Dark ache, foul stain,
strives to remain,
shifts from inside,
draws all life.
Bright shining spheres,
help us, oh hear..

Altered heroes,
broken mirrors,
ash to dust and
love to lust.

Trapped in their lives.
