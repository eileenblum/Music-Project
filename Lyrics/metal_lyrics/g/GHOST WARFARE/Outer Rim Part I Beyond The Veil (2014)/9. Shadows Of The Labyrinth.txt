[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Run, your majesty,
hide your sanity.
Keep the words of thee
It's your legacy.

Falling shades craw to devour...
What!?.. that feeling!
Form the land, then call the hour..
.. am I.. I'm bleeding!

Run, your majesty,
hide your sanity.
Keep the words of thee
It's your legacy.

Stream of light project the desire.
I, I see how!
You won't be burned, you are the fire.
Yes, I know now.

The shadows will come,
the darkness will grow!

I was born with broken eyes,
blind I roamed.
Curse my fate, deny my rise,
my kingdom, my honor.

Ravage my lands, search for my powers,
climb up the hills and
break the seals, enter the tower
where your end begins!

The shadows will come,
the darkness will grow!

I alone in this night..
Fight - with thousands of thy kind.
I empowered the light.
Shine, but shadows were born of ones.

How they found their way here -
showed no weakness, no fear.
True and powerful seers,
cast their shadows trough time and space.

Come, realize, see the fight
where no one is right.
They all hold the believe
that they might win and live.
To arise and again
fill their lives with an aim.
To emerge and become
more than the shadow form.
And they'll not obey
no power, no way,
when the time freezes still
they will turn the wheel!

Time loose to chain the new masters of life!
