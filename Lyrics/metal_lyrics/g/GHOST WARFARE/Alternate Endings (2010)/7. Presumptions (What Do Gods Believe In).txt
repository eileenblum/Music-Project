[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

- .. but.. we created them weak, for the purpose to serve, what can make them now.. so powerful??
- we think.. it's their believes.
- .. believes?!?

- I want to believe!
- Aa-a-a-a.
- I want to believe!
- .. believe?!
- I want to believe!
- Aa-a-a-a.
- I want to believe!
- In WHAT, boy?!

- I need to believe!
- Aa-a-a-a.
- I need to believe!
- .. oh, came on!!
- I need to believe!
- Aa-a-a-a.
- I need to believe!
- NOOOOOOOO!!

- That the end will come!
- Yes, it will for some.
- That the souls will burn!
- The wheel will take its turn.

Passions and crimes, and betrayals, and confessions to make -
do understand - religion is fake!
They all believe that they follow a sign,
they can not see, they are all blind!

Still they go on to waste faith in a lie -
it makes 'em live, it makes 'em die!
Eyes staring high and hoping to be,
but why do you choose, choose to believe!?

- That the end will come!
- Yes, it will for some.
- That the souls will burn!
- The wheel will take its turn.

And it turns..
.. and it turns..
.. and it turns..

The twisted.. path.. of faith.
