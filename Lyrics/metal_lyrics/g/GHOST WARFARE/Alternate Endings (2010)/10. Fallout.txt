[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

A survival shelter
designed to protect
a small number of humans
from the nuclear fallout.

You were betrayed
by your own father.
Left you for dead
in the mighty vault.
One-o-one praise -
glory and power.
Can you escape?
The bounds of your..

... faaaaaaaate.
Your faaaaaaaate.

A wasteland in ruins
with radiation burns
a journey to follow
his footsteps and deeds.

Running from death,
raiders and fire.
Hunted by men,
mutants and other scum.
On your way you
are taking it higher
and left a trace
in the nuclear..

... waaaaaaaaaasste.
The Waaaaaaaaaaaste.

Your faaaaaaaate
is waste.
faaaaaaaate
is waste.

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaste
laaaaaaaaaaaaaand.
