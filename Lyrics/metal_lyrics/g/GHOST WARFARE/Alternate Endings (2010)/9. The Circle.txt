[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Now you stand in front the doorstep to my hall.
Your shadow - the one that came before..
THE WAR!

[Bridge]
Perfecting death in silence.
Reflecting colors, more.
Creating floods of violence.
What did you came.. here.. for?

Cold lies the throne to the circle of mages,
history full with the wars it wages.
Nearly erased by the flow of ages
time measures life born of chaos, that rages!

You want to kill the one upon you still subsist.
Your reason battles your hatred to exist.
AT ALL!

The outer days approaching,
your search remains the same.
The gates you're finally touching
will never hear.. your.. name!

Earth torn apart by the circle of mages,
meant to end all the great wars it wages.
History closes, its end of these ages,
time stops and freezes the chaos, that rages!

Stand up tall
and head the call,
evolve then,
some are others from
a distant space.
Another race!

They fought a war of fear.
They lost and disappeared.

Stand up tall
and head the call,
evolve then,
some are others from
creators grace.
They've left trace!

They fought a war of fear,
They lost and disappeared!

AND NOW

Earth crying waves for the circle of mages,
quakes shake the ground for the wars it wages.
It is not lost to the sands of ages,
order shall tame all the chaos, that rages!
