[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Can you tell me, friend
do you believe you truly see?
.. my reality.

Can you show me, friend
my place, my right to be
.. it's insanity.

LOOK!
You go and read a book,
you learn to write your name
and don't live like a fool in vain.

And thisâreligion what is best?
Am I like the rest -
stupid little blinded pest?

This - religion!?
FUCK RELIGION

pest, you're the stupid blinded pest!
You're fool just like the rest!

It's my reality..
It's your insanity!

Do you know, my friend
I'm more than you will ever be?
.. will you ever be?

Your eyes are closed
as are the eyes of all the most!
.. you will never..

LOOK!
You go and read a book,
you learn to write your name
and don't live like a fool in vain.

And thisâreligion what is best?
Am I like the rest -
stupid little blinded pest?

Is this.. religion!?
FUCK RELIGION!

[2x]
You're the blasted fool in vain
You're the stupid little man

YYEEEEEEAAAAAAH!

Do you know, my friend
I'm more than you will ever be
.. will you ever be?

You're eyes are closed
as are the eyes of all the most
.. you will never..

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
It's my reality..
IT'S YOUR INSANITY!!!

You're the blasted fool in vain
You're the stupid little man
