[music: G. Latev, lyrics: G. Latev]

Now I'm tired
From their lie
Now I'm tired
From their cry
From their dirt
And their illusion
Without order
Only confusion
I leave the world
I walk inside
In my deep end
in my tortured mind
Somewhere is behind me
There is nowhere to hide
The truth is beside me
I'm going to fall in that

HOLE
A fucking HOLE
All our history
Is a big fat joke
The god's path
We'll need to unlock
To survive the tornado
Of their furious will
To outstand the storm
To become the thrill
But can we do that
Can we just change
Can we lose our life
For a single revenge
I hear the sound
Of the last call
And I know we all
Are going to jump in that
HOLE
A fucking HOLE
