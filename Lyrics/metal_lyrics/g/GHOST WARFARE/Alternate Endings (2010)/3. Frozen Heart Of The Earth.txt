[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

The frozen.. hearth.. of the Earth!

Aaaaaa, a-aaaaaaaaaa
Aaaaaa, a-aaa, a-aaaa..

There.. is just one way.
Down.. the northern bay.
In.. the icy gorge.
My.. soul will forge.

Icy.. chill.. in the wind!

Aaaaaa, a-aaaaaaaaaa
Aaaaaa, a-aaa, a-aaaa..

There.. trapped in frost.
Lies.. what have we lost.
Is.. it really here?
it waits.. or disappears.

Frozen..
Frozen..
Frozen..
FROZEN!!!
