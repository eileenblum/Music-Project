[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Can't you feel that this is power,
solid mater, chaos fire.
Dance, become my sacred pyre,
burn me down alive!

You followed me,
I let you breathe.

You followed me,
I set you free.

Body and pure mind.
Fusion
gave us
Miiiiiiight!

Showed you off the secrets higher,
you freaked, you called me liar.
Was it all a desperate try,
Am I always right!?

You hated me!
I couldn't see..

You hated me!
I walk, I bleed..

Born in darkened night.
fusion
fusion
gave us
gave us
liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.

Fusion.
Confusion.
Illusion.
Delusion.

NOOOOO!
