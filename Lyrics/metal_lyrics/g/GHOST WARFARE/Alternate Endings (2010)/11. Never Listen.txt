[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Aaahhh..

I've wasted all my years..
Trying to hold your tears.

You're everything to me.
Without you I won't be.

I'd give my life away..
There's nothing more to say.

And I'd leave it all behind..
My life, my fears, my pride!

you never listen,
you go your way.

No, you never listen
you go your way.

And I've wasted all my years..
Trying to hold your tears.

You're everything to me.
Without you I won't be.

I'd give my life away..
There's nothing more to say.

And I'd leave it all behind..
My life, my fears, my pride!

you never listen,
you go your way.

No, you never listen
you go your
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.

You never listen
you go your way.

I've wasted all my years,
trying to hold..
