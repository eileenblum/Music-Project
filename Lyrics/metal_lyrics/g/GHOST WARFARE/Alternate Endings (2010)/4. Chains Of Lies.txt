[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

Dragging with no honor
bloody trail of horror
crushing in a foul embrace.

Ringing in disorder
smiling one-another
gripping hard the cursed race.

They try to build the Chains Of Lies.
They seek the pain of Chains in Lies.
They shall accept the filth Of Lies.
They kill to serve the Chains Of Lies

Some opposed the others
and have crossed the borders
to a better-better life.

Throw away the murders
can't go any further
it's the end of all the lies.

They refuse to serve the chains of lies.
They deny the use of chains of lies.
They decide to fight the chains of lies.
They will destroy the chains of lies.

They slay chains.
They kill lies.
