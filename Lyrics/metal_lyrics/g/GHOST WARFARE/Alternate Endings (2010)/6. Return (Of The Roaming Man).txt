[music: G. Latev, lyrics: D. Naydev]

What returned the time
right into my mind?
Was I once..?
will I be..?

Searching once again
crystal clouds of pain.
Could they be..?
Inside me..?

Reeeeetuuuuurn [4x]

Cold am, but will burn
for I need to return

Every time denied
hurts to be described.
A long road,
a long road..

Facing all the world,
can't wait, can not hold.
It's calling,
I'm coming..

Reeeeetuuuuurn [4x]

Cold am, but will burn
for I need to return.

Dragged am into the past
I will be there at last.

Cold am, but will burn
for I need to return

cold am.. COLD AM
cold am..

Reeeeeeeeetttttuuuuurrrnnn..
