[music: G. Latev lyrics: D. Naydev]

One day just appeared,
glowing dark spheres.

They wanted to kill,
to break our will,
drive us insane.

They carried the end
one can not withstand.

Hey! You will now die!
Do you know why?
Do you know?

You're going down!
Blasphemer!
Going down!
Blasphemer!
Going down!
Blasphemer!

You're going down!
Blasphemer!
Down..
Blasphemer!
DOWN!
Blasphemer!

Going down to face the
ruthless race!
You'd wish you were dead.

Going down into.. what?
What's that place!?
There's nothing ahead!

That's what you deserve,
that's what you will get.

Yes, once we have met,
as was then said,
you're gonna die.

And YOU let it all be!
This great misery..

That now poisons your mind,
and dooms your kind,
turns you to slaves!

You're going down!
Blasphemer!
Going down!
Blasphemer!
Going down!
Blasphemer!

You're going down!
Blasphemer!
Down..
Blasphemer!
DOWN!
Blasphemer!

Going down and you are
one of them!
What happened and when?

DEATH!
Again.. and again!
It's the down of man.

You're going down!
Blasphemer!
Down..
Blasphemer!
DOWN!
Blasphemer!

You're going down
Blasphemer!
Down..
Blasphemer!
DOWN!
Blasphemer!

On your way there is a
magic fist!
And we shall not withdraw!

On your way a wall of
truth will rise!
And you're going to pay!

The price,
you're going to pay the price.

Down, going down,
(down) going down,
(down) going down.
