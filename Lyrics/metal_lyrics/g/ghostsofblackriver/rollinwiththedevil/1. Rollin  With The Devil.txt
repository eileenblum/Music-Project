Lord only knows but he cannot help me.
So many times there will be no more.
Rolling with the Devil.
Rolling with the Devil.
Heading down that road back to the town of misery.
That is where I belong isolated but free.
Lord would you help me find my way home.

Cannot save your soul if you cannot save yourself
Lord knows how I have tried to make the wrongs all right
Rolling with the Devil.
Rolling with the Devil.
Heading down that road back to the town of misery.
That is where I belong isolated but free.
Lord would you help me find my way home.
