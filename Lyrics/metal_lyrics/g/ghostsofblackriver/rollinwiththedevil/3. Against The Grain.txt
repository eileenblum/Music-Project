Staring out into the rain aimlessly and dazed
As I feel you slip away torn away despite what they say.
I feel the same pain everyday when I awake I see your face.
And you know we still remain forever against the grain
And you know we still remain forever against the grain

No matter what I do or say would not even begin to change a damn thing.
All I have is memories they are the only thing left inside of me.
Despite what they say I feel the pain fade each day when I awake a new beginning.
And you know we still remain forever against the grain
And you know we still remain forever against the grain
