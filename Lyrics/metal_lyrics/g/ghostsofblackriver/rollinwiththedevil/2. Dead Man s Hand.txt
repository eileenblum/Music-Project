I hear it calling out my name.
Hunting me down every day.
Promising to ease my pain.
I have nothing else to gain.

It is a lie but I do not mind
I do not give a damn because I am getting by.
It is a lie but I do not mind my friends.
I am down to raise hell that is just the way I am
And that is no lie that aint no lie.

Completely, lost for words.
I am banging my head against a god damn wall.
I try to make them look try to make them see.
That you are the one for me.

Sliding down onto a hole.
Tearing skin down to the bone.
Try to find what's inside me.
But I am afraid of what I will see.
Of what I will see.
