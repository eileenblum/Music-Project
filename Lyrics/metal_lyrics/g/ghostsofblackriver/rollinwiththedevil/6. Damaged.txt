Another bottle of whiskey shatters fist fly in fits of rage.
Teeth splat, jaws are broken but he will live to drink another day
Peering out of the window hiding another fool with a debt to pay.
Wide eyed with paranoia in bed with a gun he lays.

The countless times I have seen it
You were the one who wanted.
Your eyes seem so blinded
You were the one who wanted
Damage I have seen it all before.
Damage take a look around.
Damage I have seen it all before.
Damage take a look around.

Before you start to realise it dead skin is peeled away.
Next thing you know you will find it laid out for all to see.
I have walked the darkened streets I have looked through their crooked eyes.
I drowned in rivers of madness but I came out of it alive.

Another bottle of whiskey shatters fist fly in fits of rage.
Teeth splat, jaws are broken but he will live to drink another day
Peering out of the window hiding another fool with a debt to pay.
Wide eyed with paranoia in bed with a gun he lays.
