The fight has just begun man and I see no end in sight.
A self destructive train of thought pulsing inside your head.
Persecuted, executed by everyone around.
The one who stood there by your side are nowhere to be found.

Lost in your destructive ways scars will fade
And I see it in your eyes pulsing through your veins.
You finally realised what you have become.
Second to none

Self hatred is over-rated.
Covered in the blood of the past.
And I see it in your eyes pulsing through your veins.
You finally realised what you have become.
Second to none
