Clashing of heads blasting of thoughts.
Anger inside regret the cost.
You cannot regain what you have lost.
Left it to rot now it is gone.

You will always find yourself this way.
Twisting turning through your misery.
Tempers fly as the walls explode.
You're overwhelmed with a lack of control.
Like a poison numbing your senses.
You try to fight it but you know what follows.
The end is here my friend but you will never see it coming.
Each day is one step closer to your fucking demise.
The end is here my friend the hunter will be the hunted each day is one step closer.

You do not see what you have become
Refuse the plea answer to none.
God like you feel bow down to none.
Inside your head you are the one.

All of the things you tried to keep.
Inside your mind helped the decline.
You cannot regain what you have lost.
Left it to rot now it is gone.
