Endless loss of the vital functions,
collapse and inner occlusion.
Dissection - reactive process of pathogenic nucleus.
Entrails got sickened - surgical abomination.
Jugular veins sliced, cranial tissue in decay.
Morbid state caused by infective germs,
abnormal incision of the veins' wall.
Mucous lesion,
critical dysfunction and gargling disease.
Intestinal paralysis,
necrotic parasitic forms infect.
Unicellular micro-organisms secretes blood,
progression in decay.
Contraction - regurgitation of the muscular tissues,
neuro system collapsed.
Bacteriological manifestation,
decrepit anomaly... damage done.
