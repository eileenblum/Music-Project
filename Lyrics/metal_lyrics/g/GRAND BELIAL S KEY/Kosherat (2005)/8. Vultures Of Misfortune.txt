[Introduction â a traditional Jewish song called "Sha! Shtil!":]
Sha! Shtil! Macht nisht keyn gerider!
Der rabe geyt shoyn tantsn vider.
Sha! Shtil! Macht nisht keyn gevalt!
Der rebe geyt shoyn tantsn bald.
Un az der rebe tanst,
Tantsn doch di vent,
Lomir ale plyeskn mit di hent.
Sha! Shtil! Do not make a sound!
For the rabbi will soon dance around.
Sha! Shtil! Do not break his trance,
The rabbi is about to dance.

As the Rabbi's rum swishes in his corroded mouth
He excises the foreskin uncovering the gentle glans
So that the corona is laid bare

He whom sucketh the incised tip
Bears the eyes of sadism
In his seductive hands a bandage
And a load of cumin seeds
Now raiseth the cup of benediction

The cruelest cut of all
With the sharp end of his finger nail
He tears the softest of membranes
An organ disfigured, a penis mutilated
The blood extracted by suction
Appalling practices of so called scholars
Young trusted to a circumciser
Yiddish trinkets cover the newborn

"Opprobrium for the wicked, as it is written"

Freshly cut dick into his trap
The gobbler mixes it with alcohol
Queer tendencies within the grossest of cultures

"Opprobrium for the wicked, as it is written"

As the Rabbi's rum swishes in his corroded mouth
He excises the foreskin uncovering the gentle glans

Double-edged blade slices
To finish the damaged nerves

Into a contaminated bowl the bloodrum is puked
Mouth to cock infections
Unhealed wounds in the mind
Little solace to the innocent
