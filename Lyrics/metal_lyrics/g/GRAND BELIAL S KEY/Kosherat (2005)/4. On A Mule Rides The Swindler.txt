Delivered from her guileful genitalia
Greedy tentmakers and soothsayers
Unleavened bread for seven days
Unclogging the birth canal
Oh, most merciful queen of life
Mother of harlots and stalkers

On the mule rides the swindler

Greed of Eve, goddess of dirt, femine beast of the hex
Unleavened bread for seven days
Unclogging the birth canal
Oh, most merciful queen of life
Mother of harlots and stalkers

On the mule rides the swindler

"Ye son of the sorceress"
Follow the path of the urethra, into the heart of affliction
Surrender to the pagan torture

From the first Jew Abraham
To the last standing crippled bastard
Declared part of their kin by their mother's field placenta

So frightened by the goyim
So convinced of his own nobility
Crawling on the excretion of asses
And corpses covered with flies

"Ye son of the sorceress"
Follow the path of the urethra, into the heart of affliction
Surrender to the pagan torture
