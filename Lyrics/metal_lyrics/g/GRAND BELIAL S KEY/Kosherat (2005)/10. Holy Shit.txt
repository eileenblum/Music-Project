Take his cross off his neck
Lunge it down into his throat
Watch him choke, gasp for air,
He has spoken his last prayer

Holy bible full of shit like your pants
Holy Water
Watch me spit in your face

Christmas day he was born
Easter day ripped and torn
Carried a cross upon his back
Crown of thorns about his neck

Holy bible full of shit like your pants
Holy Water
Watch me spit in your face

Listen to me Jesus Christ
From what I've read I'm glad you're dead
I wanna meet you, I wanna teach you
I wanna beat you like the Jew that you are!

Holy bible full of shit like your pants
Holy Water
Watch me spit in your face
