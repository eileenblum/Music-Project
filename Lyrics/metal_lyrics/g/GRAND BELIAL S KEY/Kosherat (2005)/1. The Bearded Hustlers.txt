To ridicule their false messiah

They spit on their own beards
They spit on their own hairy chests
Symbolic of their odium
Towards anything that's non-Hebraic

To ridicule their false messiah

Insurgents cut off their own fingers in protest
The songs of Zion unheard for centuries

Such is the blood lust of these bearded hustlers

The bitter water at Tara where
Thieves with punctured ears did drown

Such is the blood lust of these bearded hustlers

Choking and dying by the stream
In the form of a star the scum surrounded their captive

Spitting and salivating on the floor
Staves beating on his head
Matrilineal hoodlums heckling

Jeering and taunting the prophecies
Written in their own occult books
