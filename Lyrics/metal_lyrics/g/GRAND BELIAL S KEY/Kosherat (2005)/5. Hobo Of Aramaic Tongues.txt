Fugitive, witch-doctor, born in an impoverished stable
Could this flimsy child truly be an predicted scepter?

Balaam's prophecy, Judah's predictions
Artificial pages of an unearthly fetish
Interpreter of the Torah
Worshipped by the Magi of Arabia

Hobo of Aramaic Tongues

The outline of a dead fish on a wall of mud
Signs of the resistance

Hobo of Aramaic Tongues

Frauds, hoaxes, serpents of Earth
Surviving on quails and manna
Christmas star of a frozen Palestine
Saturn no longer protects thee

The outline of a dead fish on a wall of mud
Signs of the resistance

Hobo of Aramaic Tongues
