[originally by Chaos 88]

Chaos, revelation, murder;
the time is now
Government, shutdown, anarchy;
it's all around
Hostile, takeover, protection;
it's not around
Looting, robbing, everyone
is for themselves

There's no future. Doom generation.
There's no future for you!

Politicians, corruption,
they're all on the take
Federal prisons, jailbreak;
it's free parole
Alcohol, firearms, prostitutes;
they're all for free!

Angry kids and loaded guns
Senseless murder is real fun
Angry kids and loaded guns
Got those fuckers on the run!

Chaos, revelation, murder;
the time is now
Government, shutdown, anarchy;
it's all around
Hostile, takeover, protection;
it's not around
Looting, robbing, everyone
is for themselves

There's no future. Doom generation.
There's no future for you!

Politicians, corruption,
they're all on the take
Federal prisons, jailbreak;
it's free parole
Alcohol, firearms, prostitutes;
they're all for free!

Angry kids and loaded guns
Senseless murder is real fun
Angry kids and loaded guns
