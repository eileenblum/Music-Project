Sources of uncleanness as told by the elders
The contagion spreads to the spirit
And nowhere may she sitteth
Bleeding wench, daughter of Samuel

Eight days of solitude end
With the slaughter of two pigeons
The congregation of madmen speaketh in magical words

Her meat flower and its folds
Must grip with the reality of their revolting beliefs
And whosoever toucheth the flea-ridden bearer
Of the Hasmonean lunatics
Shall be unclean until she is drained
Of her venomous emissions

Eight days of solitude end
With the slaughter of two pigeons
The congregation of madmen speaketh in magical words

The Immaculate Latrine
Hygienic practice is only a mirage

Filth of the testing rag
Perverted examination of the color
The menses produced in her
Red, black, or like diluted wine!
The wound, oppressor of lust
Louse crushed by copulation

Filth of the testing rag
Perverted examination of the color
The menses produced in her
Red, black, or like diluted wine!
The wound, oppressor of lust, louse is crushed
