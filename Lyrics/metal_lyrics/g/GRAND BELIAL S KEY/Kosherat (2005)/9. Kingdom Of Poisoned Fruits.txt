Mice sip the clitoral discharge
That drips in red from her stagnant slit
On a silver tray she lays sodomized
Her weeping face symbolizes mankind

Norns take part in the espionage
Some tell of the fruitful kingdoms
Encircled by fantastic homages
To devoted slaves of faith

They have fallen from far above
Unmasked to plunge into eternity

A pond is filled with miraculous wines
Deformed valkyries float about the prairie

They have fallen from far above
Unmasked to plunge into eternity
Kingdom of Poisoned Fruits

The scaffold stands tall in the town
Bystanders faint in total disgust
A demonic mass to follow
The vivid decollation of God

Kingdom of Poisoned Fruits
