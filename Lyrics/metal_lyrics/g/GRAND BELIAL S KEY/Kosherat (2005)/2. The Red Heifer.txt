So loaded with justified guilt is the soul of the Yisrealites
That only the sacrifice of a cow may save them

Miasmic ritual of the Levi tribes
Opens the gate to a bygone era
Labor camp vultures plan to topple
The Dome of the Rock

Bring forth the Red Heifer upon which never came yoke
To be murdered on its third year
Avenging the Temple's demolition

Its blood, skin, flesh and dung
To burneth before the impure
Levitical dogs cleanse themselves
Beneath a torrential storm of piss

So loaded with justified guilt is the soul of the Yisrealites
That only the sacrifice of a cow may save them

Hyssop and scarlet ruin the air
Four legged messiah, color of rust
Its blood, skin, flesh and dung
To burneth before the impure
Levitical dogs cleanse themselves
Beneath a torrential storm of piss

Oh, no! The tabernacle sprinkled with its ashes

Hyssop and scarlet ruin the air
Four legged messiah, color of rust
Bring forth the Red Heifer upon which never came yoke

To be murdered on its third year
Avenging the Temple's demolition

Oh, no! The tabernacle sprinkled with its ashes
