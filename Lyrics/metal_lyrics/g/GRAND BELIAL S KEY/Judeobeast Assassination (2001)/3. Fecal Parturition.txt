The yeasty froth of her pussy lips 
Covered the body of the tenderhearted 
Never could the 6-pointed star be trusted 
Damnable heresies survive the epoch 

The moisture built up between her legs 
Gave welcome to the Satanachrist 
Like veins, the nest of life was cut 
The rainbow never appeareth above the throne 

Fecal parturition, fecal parturition 

Who breathes these ritual flames 
Coughed up by the lungs of treachery? 
Jesus combed his scarlet hair while 
Cum dripped from his sacred asshole 

He was then led into the common hall 
But never didst the 9th hour arrive 
Quench all the fiery darts of the wicked 
"Hosanna to the Son of David", spoke pig 

Who breathes these ritual flames 
Coughed up by the lungs of treachery? 

Fecal parturition, fecal parturition 
"Hosanna to the Son of David", spoke pig
