"Ye are never to be clothed in white garment 
for ye are the sperm of the antichrist" 
Dear children of light and prayer 
Stand against the wiles of Satanicunt 

Dead is the Lion of the Tribe of Juda 
No sound cometh from the lamb?s harp 
The sickle hath been raised by the Son 
The lame have been denied their supplication 

"Ye are never to be clothed in white garment 
for ye are the sperm of the antichrist" 

Take the helmet of salvation 
The doves of war have cometh... 
Take the breastplate of righteousness 
The doves of war have cometh... 
Take the golden shield of faith 
The doves of war have cometh... 
Take the sword of God?s spirit 
The doves of war have cometh... 
Grand Belial begat The Lourde 
The doves of war have cometh... 
Grand Belial begat Gelal 
The doves of war have cometh... 
With the hate of Demonic 
The doves of war have cometh... 
The hordes thus ride triumphantly 
The doves of war have cometh...
