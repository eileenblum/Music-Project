Licentious damsels ingesting semen juice 
The prince of life by these lustful means 
Was righteously conceived,his birth drew nigh 
The throne of his father he hath inherited 

Only for the tetrach to taketh away 
The hopeof diseased folk who followed 
Fourteen generations of venal dishonesty 
Ceased not teach in his given name 

Lamb of God slain will be... 
Lamb of God slain will be... 

Beneath the wise star suffered the accused 
Myrrh and vinegar sprinkled on his hippie lips 
A reversed consecration for the antagonist 
Thy faith hath made thee copulate in heaven 

The enigmas of his birth 
Told by traveling shepherds 
In the distance murmurs are heard 
They announce the flood of pus 

Bitches cometh to anoint the bruised residue 
Exequies outlawed by the pagan centurions 
Gastric lacerations silenced the clamor 
God could not rebuke the contaminated spirits 

The priest is driven to confession 
He admits to an act of bestiality 
With the corpse of the black ram 
Without honor he stabs himself 

He bled the blackest blood 
For he was already deceased
