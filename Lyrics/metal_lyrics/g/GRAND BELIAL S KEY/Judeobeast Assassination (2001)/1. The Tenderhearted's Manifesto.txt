Sowing the black seed in the field of the world 
He journeyed deep into the desert's darkness 
To consume hallucinogens for his ill charades 
Bread of stones is the lie of the tempted 

With his baptized dick the son of pork played 
Alone with drugs he lived for over 40 days 
He fasted not for the sake of temptation 
Nomadic urges controlled the junkie's life 

The fig tree stood dead taunting Judaea 
Into timeless famine the pale horse fell 
The inseparability of judeo-christianity 
Permitted the corruption of man 

An inverted cross is hewed on his face 

Christ, faggot, fondler of manhood 
Christ, faggot, fondler of manhood 

The river of Jordan, a cesspool of scabs 
Lord almighty prays for the cleansing 
And purification of his intruded anus
