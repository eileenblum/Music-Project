[Music: Gelal / Lyrics: The Black Lourde of Crucifixion, Gelal]

Ashes... Ashes... We all fall down,
In ruins lies the Yahweh's Crown...
In Flames!

Unto the winds my hecatomb
A seed to be sown;
The scrap memories of Jerusalem
A reverie of shallow pith
Insipid wretched law;
Mindless relics poison the Judaist corpse heads!

Into this breeze a foulest smell
Rotting pride and greed;
A garbage pile in splendrous disease
With God above, Satan below
No mortals live in the battlezone!

Destroyed by might from the devil's whip
The feign didst die by death's ill grip!
Hebrew prayers burned in fires high
A savage fate gleemed in Old Nick's eye!

Wicked goats pissed to groom the blaze
Fuel to a fire in which Hell was praised!
The urine of goats flood the slums of Jerusalem

Ashes... Ashes... All gods fall down,
In urine bathes their holy crowns!

Destroyed by might from the devil's whip
The feign didst die by death's ill grip
Hebrew prayers burned in fires high
A savage fate gleemed in Old Nick's eye!

Wicked goats pissed to groom the blaze
Fuel to a fire in which Hell was praised
Daughter Jerusalem is fallen!
I am one with her destruction...
In burning forever!!

Ashes... Ashes... All gods fall down
In urine bathes their holy crowns!

On thy knees pious ones; Kiss on my vile hind
Beg for the sword of vicious the pain will be!
On thy feel pious one; Suckle my vile horns
Beg for the pain or vicious the sword will be!

Daughter Jerusalem is fallen!
1 am one with her destruction...
In burning forever!!

The Lord's supper has been mocked
His birth is no longer celebrated
Eunuchs feast on the bestial flesh
Drink his wine and pillage the nunery

The urine of goats flood the slums of Jerusalem!

The branch no longer bears its fruits
Nor flourishes its fable upon mankind
Children masticate the sacred vulva
And cast fire across the holy garlands!
