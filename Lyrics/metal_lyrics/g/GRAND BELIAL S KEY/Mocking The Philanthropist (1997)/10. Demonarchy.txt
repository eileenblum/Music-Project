[Music: Gelal/Lyrics: Gelal]

The gatekeepers amputate their arms in torment
Abandoned by the painful shackles of heaven
Their maternal bodies devoured gruesomely
Father of the unconceivable lifts his shield

His name was unknown to me
Until I entered the arcane
Depths of the Demonarchy
Summoning Jehova's Casket

There exists secrecy among the troops
Waiting to besiege the fountain of life
Like torches of a forgotten Kristallnacht
Storming through the city of Nazareth

His name was unknown to me
Until I entered the arcane
Depths of the Demonarchy
Summoning Jehova's Casket
