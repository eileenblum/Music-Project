[Music: Gelal / Lyrics: Satanic Hordes, The Black Lourde of Crucifixion]

In the name of Satan I am bourne,
Bestow infernal powers unto me...
Shemhamforash

Ne'er the light my eyes to bear,
Grant me the joys of darkest sin...
Shemhamforash

Almighty ruler of the night,
Provide me with the gift of sweet revenge...
Shemahamforash
I kiss the throne, caress the musky hooves;
Heed the whines of deadly blasphemy...
Shemhamforash

In the name of Satan I am bourne,
Bestow infernal powers unto me...
Shemhamforash

Blessed are those of the left-hand path,
Cursed be the bastard Nazarene...
Shemhamforash

So it is done'
