[Music: Gelal, Lilith / Lyrics: La Vey]

Ra-asa isalamanu para-di-zoda oe-cari-mi
aao iala-pire-gahe qui-inn.
Enai butamonu od inoasa m pa-ra-diala.
Casaremeji ujeare cahirelanu,
od zodonace lucifatianu,
caresa ta vavalezodirenu tol-hami.
Soba lonudohe od nuame cahisa ta

Zodacare! Zodameranu! lecanmi quo-a
dahe od i-mica-ol-zododa aaiome.
Bajirele papenore idalugama elonusahi-od
umapelifa vau-ge-ji bijil-iad.

[ENGLISH]
The east is a house of harlots singing praises among the flames
of the first glory wherin the Dark Lord hath opened his mouth;
and they are become as living dwellings
in whom the strength of man rejoiceth;
and they are appareled with ornaments
of brightness, such as work wonders on all creatures.
Whose kingdoms and continuance are as the third and fourth,
strong towers and places of comfort,
the seats of pleasure and continuance.
O ye servants of pleasure, move!
Appear!
Sing praises unto the earth and
be mighty amongst us.
For that to this remembrance is given power,
and our strength
waxeth strong in our comforter.
