Shape shifting we begin to form
At the bottom of the sea
Once a man begin to roam
Monkey man in the trees

And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
We let go with some soul
Elevated man

Burnin' free smiles line the fire
Caveman's empty
Human woman
Like a monkey to the trees

And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
We let go with some soul
Elevated man

Hey oh
Hey oh
Hey alright

Hey oh
Hey oh
Hey oh

Fell back to Earth
Half an outer-space man
Long the wake lose my way
Fly long elevated man

And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
And we let go with some soul
Elevated man
