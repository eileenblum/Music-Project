Laughing and fallin'
Don't apologize
Feel it in the morning
With sandpaper eyes
Drinkin' my whisky
She drinks her wine
And if my baby is willin'
I roar to oblivion
With her by my side

Easy

Fellout and tore up
With my friends and their freaks
We laugh and lie so high it's sweet
The girls want to fuck
But we're to gone
Running after life and the light till dawn
Drinking our whisky
Drinking our wine
And if my baby still willin
I'll roar to oblivion with her by my side

Easy easy whisky wine
Greasy

Toast eye to eye
We're on our way
The secret is ours
We're on our way
With my love
All I need
A reason for living

Easy.
