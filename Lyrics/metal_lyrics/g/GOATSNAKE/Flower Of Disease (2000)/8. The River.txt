River
Passing me
Did you feel my heart leaving

River
Hearing me
Please take my heart gently
To the sea

I sink to float along
I sink to float along
I sink to float along
I sink to float along

River
Flowing
Have you ever been lonely

River
How I envy
Forgetting so easily
To the sea

I sink to float along
I sink to float along
I sink to float along
I sink to float along.
