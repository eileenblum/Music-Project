Oh the light it comes a creep
And the night it leaves
It's the end of the dawn

Come the morning bury me
Keep my candles
A burn into the dawn

The blues and city shits
Open the door let's it in
Destroys my faculties
Blinds me to my knee

As the darkness covers me
I begin to dream
Of visions that I long

Yeah you got to rock the roll
Set your fancies
A chance yet to be free again

In my system running strong
Shinning sins and setting suns
On my back like a hounding bitch dog

Lay in the shadows and pray for a dying

I reach for the arms
But I can't catch my faith
I land on the floor and crawl
On my skin

Lay in the shadows and pray for a dying.
