Got my wheels in motion
Rev'd up high
Got my city engines
Out for a ride while I'm alive

I might die tomorrow
I'm gonna live today

Got my loco motion
Rattlin' bones
Sweating gin and smoking
Pockets full of rolling stoned

I might die tomorrow
I'm gonna live today

Yesterdays over
And we all
Die like we live today

Got my molly peculiar
She's a little miss strange
She's my witch and with my broomstick
Gonna ride all night while alive

I might die tomorrow
I'm gonna live today

Yesterdays over
And we all
Die like we live today

And we all
And we all
Die like we live today.
