Voices in my head say hello
Silence greets my lips echo
I touch these walls of this place I know
Death is standing right outside the door

I smile inside to hide the cries
That pain just loves to multiply

These scars are mine the sores I know
Cuts me deep and slowly takes my soul
I face these walls of this place alone
I know your love but still it can't follow

I smile inside to hide the cries
That pain just loves to multiply
I search for ways through my tears
To find a way to destroy my fears

Watering this flower of disease.
