For all the stars
And a show of hands
It's in the cards
Since time began

Through all the dawns
The midnights
What's in the shadows
And the sunlight

I was there when Adam turned the leaf
Jesus wept..oh lord please don't forsake me
And the cards they throw on down
And the cards they throw on down
And the cards they throw on down
Devil don't misquote me

Through all the suns
And sunken moons
I've painted hills with the lost trails of many

I'm the bars with the crooked smiles
It's my eyes that guide you stumbling home
The crooked mile

Angel eyes with fallen wings
I was there when Gabriel cried
Oh lord don't forsake me

And the cards they throw on down
And the cards they throw on down
Devil... don't misquote me

It's your deal.
