Tripping back and forth to the moon
As the miles drip off the spoon
Jacked up on cold caffeine
Dragging my nutsthrough valvoline
Like the Flintstones they use their feet
I made the machine
Hey man smells like sumping died under the seat
Out of mind maybe

Peel it back-peel it back
You got nothin' but skin
Peel it back-black to red-peel it back
To the moon

You know I gotta move
I rust like tin if I stand still
I got my barney olfield grin on
And I take my bitch for a ride
Hey man do ya wanna come along
Peel it back
She ain't got nothing but skin
But her metal sure do shine

Peel it back-black to red-peel it back
You got nothing but skin-peel it back

If I win I lose
Nothing but skin
Nothing
Shit goddamn.
