In your sleep, I will hunt you down!
Crunch bones. Rage war.
I said ''Your life is a worthless game,''
Darkness covers your life today in shadows
You run away, I'll feast on agony's only day.
In the pit of saddened clowns, screams of pain, I get aroused,
Carcass melted down, only Krunch can silence the sounds...
Of pain. It's always the same. You, dying in pain. Pain! Pain! Pain!
I wait at your open grave,
Laughing at your silent grace, I'll spit on your broken face,
Killing in the only name,
Til then, I'll hunt you down, til I see your silent frown,
Where left is only ground screaming of the unholy sound.
Of pain, it's always the same. You, dying of pain. Pain! Pain! Pain!
It's so insane.
Lockjaw is hunting down, trudging is his only sound,
Ticket to your screams of pain, agony drives you insane!
This is my chosen life, driven by the gods of pain,
If I am wrong, you are right, why will you die tonight?
