Do you think that you can fight me?
You worthless, little worm!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
The fighting must go through, I'll kick you when you're down,
Back-stabbing shit-heads (censored???), laughing like a clown,
Cop, you wanna go through? Shoot you when you're down,
Back-stabbing shit-heads (censored???) throwing you like you've flown,
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
I am not a liar, worthless, little cunt (censored???),
Rip you all and loving it when I kick you, when I cut,
Ah, you little shit-heads (censored???), you will be a fool,
If you are, you'll feel it when I (fuck but censored??) with a tool,
Shitty (censored???) town weasle, stealing what you got,
Spooked you wide open when I give you one more shot,
Ah, you little bastard (censored???), you won't be a fuss,
Fast little bastard (censored???), probably die a wuss,
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
I am not a liar...
I am not a liar, never gonna stop.
