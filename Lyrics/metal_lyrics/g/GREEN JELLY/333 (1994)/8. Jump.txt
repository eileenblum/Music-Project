Kids jump when they're happy, adults jump when they're sad,
Kids jump up real high, adults jump a long way down,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Kids jump up to summer sunlight, adults jump down to cold cement,
Kids jump to keep on moving, adults jump to end it all,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
Oh, yeah-ah.
Jump, jump, jump, jump,
Kids jump when they're elated, adults jump when they're frustrated,
Kids jump to keep on moving, adults jump to end it all,
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump jump,
Now, jump.
