If you wanna be a man, you better learn to obey!
Yeah!
I put these things on my boobs, I try to tell you what to do,
Get your boy-toy under control, free my soul, free my soul,
You gotta test the testes of love, so whip it out boy, and put on that glove,
Slave boy, why don't you listen to me?
'Cause I got a ton of money.
I'll make you love me with my big strong hands,
So do your duty and act like a man,
I made it through on my knees, Poppa, don't preach my pink undies,
I like to let it all hang out, I'm dancin', baby, 'cause I know how,
You gotta test the testes of love, so whip it out boy, and put on that glove,
Slave boy, why don't you listen to me? (Slave, slave boy)
'Cause I got a ton of money.
I'll make you love me with my big strong hands,
So do your duty and act like a man. (Be a man)
Make you a man with a slap of my hand,
Make you a man with a slap of my hand,
Make you a man with a slap...SLAP,
Gotta tie you up to get down
Gotta tie you up to get down
Gotta tie you up to get down
Gotta tie you up to get down (Peach pit baby)
Gotta tie you up...
Peach pit baby!
Slave boy, why don't you listen to me? (Slave, slave boy)
'Cause I got a ton of money.
I'll make you love me with my big strong hands,
So do your duty and act like a man. (Be a man)
Act like a man.
Act like a man, boy
