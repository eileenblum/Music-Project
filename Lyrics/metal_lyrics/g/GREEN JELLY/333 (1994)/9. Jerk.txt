Hey all you freaks, don't you know that birds have beaks?
Can't you see the real truth? My friend Bob is missing a tooth,
If I find myself upside down, I can never turn it all around, 'cause I'm a
JERK!
I smell real bad, and I'm a
JERK!
It ain't so sad that I'm a
JERK!
Can't you see that I'm a
JERK?
It's what I wanna be!
The life I live is dumb, I spend my time watchin' my thumb,
All those years of schoolin' left me big and dumb and droolin',
If my head was on straight, maybe that wouldn't be so great, 'cause I'm a
JERK!
I smell real bad, and I'm a
JERK!
It ain't so sad that I'm a
JERK!
Can't you see that I'm a
JERK?
It's what I wanna be!
If you see me in the street, make sure that I have my feet,
If you catch me up on a wall, don't you hit me when I fall,
People ask me why I like to be a big jerk? Man, 'cause I'm a
JERK!
I smell real bad, and I'm a
JERK!
It ain't so sad that I'm a
JERK!
Can't you see that I'm a
JERK?
It's what I wanna be!
And I'm a JERK! , yeah I'm a JERK! JERK! JERK! JERK! JERK! JERK! JERK! JERK!
Man, you're a jerk...
