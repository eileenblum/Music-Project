Dead!
I've got golden hairs upon my chin,
Got my clothes right from the Goodwill bin,
Sealin' riffs and drinkin' coke,
Boppin' from the tar and smoke,
Every time I get hit,
Prizes in my head that split,
Lie around for little brats,
Wearin' backwards baseball caps,
Blindfold me and take that stick,
Hit me in the head with it!
Aye carumba, baby.
Tootsie Rolls and Mounds were in my head,
Chocolate stains remain upon my bed,
Bleach my hair and slip it back,
Cop nutritious sugar smack,
Every time I get hit,
Prizes in my head that split,
Lie around for mosh pit twits,
Writing dumb crunch metal hits,
Blindfold me and take that stick,
Hit me in the head with it!
I think that Jeremy's broken now. Jeremy's broken, huh!
Out, out to hit my head.
Ya hit my head, don't ya hit my head!
No pinata hed!
Sometimes I feel like a nut...
