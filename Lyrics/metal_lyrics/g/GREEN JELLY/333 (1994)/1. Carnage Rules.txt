Carnage rules!
Rockin' and rollin' my way through town,
Yeah, baby, I get around,
Make mine murder, paint the town red,
Squash any spider, hanging by a thread
You can't run, I'm having too much,
Listen all you fools, don't you know that carnage rules?
Told you once, I won't tell you twice, heed my word and pay my price.
All day long I'm completely insane,
Crashin' and smashin' like a hurricane,
Cruisin' all my ride,
You best step aside,
First on my list,
Crushin' bugs with my fist,
My blade's all red,
Hear what I said?
Listen all you fools, don't you know that carnage rules?...
I'm out of my mind, no time to waste,
It helps me unwind, I love the chase,
This wasting, dude, is nothing but rude,
There's no stoppin' all this toppin',
No matter what your size, crushin' spiders like flys,
Listen all you fools, don't you know carnage rules? ...
