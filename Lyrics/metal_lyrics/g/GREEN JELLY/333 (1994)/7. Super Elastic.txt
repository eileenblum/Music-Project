I don't believe you can do it.
Aaaaaaaaaa! A ha ha.
You're inexcusable.
Sleeping through the back, I (fucked a dope inspector, trouble??????) now,
Sleepwalk til I never sleep, lost in a ???? soul,
Dead come down, the spirits come to my bed,
All there is, all there was,
Reachin' for the better pills, yeah.
Super elastic, double plastic,
Decapatation takes off my head,
Why do you keep on mauling (???) me?
Distant sounds of dead men fix, we take the test to use again,
Don't you see it's all a game, schedules take control for you,
Zodiac zombie, mental mumble, you can't hear a word I say,
Go ahead and try it punk, yeah,
Super elastic, double plastic,
Decapatation takes off my head,
Super elastic, double plastic,
Regurgatation lands on my head,
Then he wanted out of the wrestling game and got into strip-teasing.
I want a Zombie in a tall glass.
Super 'lastic, never plastic, decapatation takes off my head,
Screamin' through the black, I fucked that dope inspector, trouble, ah,
Sleepwalk til I never sleep, lost in (???) soul,
Death come down, the spirits come to my bed,
All there is, all there was,
Reachin' for the better pills, yeah,
Super elastic...
AAAAAAAAAAA!!No! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Get me samples.
