What is that smell?

Walking through the plant today, scooping up what gets away
It's poo poo, poo poo
Something's smelling pretty ripe, coming from that sewer pipe
It's poo poo, poo poo

You know, everybody knows, who can smell it with their nose
It's poo poo, poo poo
I've got poo poo on my shoe, I've got poo poo on my shoe
It's poo poo, poo poo

But first, you gotta...
You gotta, you gotta, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to, got to,
SHIT MAN!
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme
SHIT MAN!
Don't gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no, gimme no
SHIT MAN!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Shit
He's got poo poo
