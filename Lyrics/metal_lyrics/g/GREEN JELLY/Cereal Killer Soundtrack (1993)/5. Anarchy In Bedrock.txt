Anarchy in Bedrock... twitch, twitch

(one, two, three, four)

Right now, hahaha...
I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist,
Don't know what I want
But know how to get it.
Want to destroy Mr. Slate

Cause I wanna be Fred Flintstone

Anarchy in Bedrock
Stop it sometime it makes Betty and Wilma
Try some flint upside down rubble bubble
Or you can just try Fruity Pebbles

Cause I wanna be Fred Flintstone
In bedrock its the only way to be

Many ways to get what you want
I use Ministry
I use Barney Rubble
I use anarchy

Cause I wanna be, Fred Flintstone
YABBA DABBA DOO!

Is this the USPA?
Is this Hollywood?
Is this Bedrock?
I thought it was Hollyrock

Cause I wanna be Fred Flintstone
And I wanna be Fred Flintstone
And I wanna be Fred Flintstone

Wilma!
