So you wanna go on the road
Wanna see my love to unfold
You must be young, and you must be bold
On your knees and do as you're told
You pull the trigger of my love gun
Can't you see we'll be having some fun
So meet me by the backstage door
Lift the skirt, and lets go for the

Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love

Got a teen and her love is mine
A guillotine for your head to unwind
Can't  you see bitch my heads to the floor
Spin around and we'll go for some more
Can't you see I'm licensing to ill
Wanna taste the blood of your kill
So, reach out and take my hand
We'll be off to Never Never Land

Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love

Come on, boys!

I know you think it's Metallica?
Well if it is my name is "duh"
Would you think we'd rip it off?
I think we did bend over and cough
So they say it's a sign of the times
When the band's chorus doesnt rhyme
It seems to happen all the time
I think we've got one nevermind

With Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
Electric Harley house of love
