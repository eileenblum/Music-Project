Are you ready to obey the cowgod?

We live in a country, we can't eat meat
Obey the cowgod
We live in a country, where there is no, there's no Burger Kings
Obey the cowgod
We live in a country, where there is no, there's no McDonald's
Obey the cowgod

Ah dopey, dopey, dopey, dopey
I'm a cow, and I'm gonna roam through your village
And I'm gonna eat all of your food
But you don't care, because I'm a, I'm a... sacred cow!
Obey the cowgod

We live in a country, where there is no, there's no Beefcake The Mighty
Obey the cowgod
We live in a country, where there is no, there's no beef-by products
Obey the cowgod

You, on your knees
You, get on your knees
Where's those two boneheads?
Get on your knees
Hands behind your heads
And on your knees
You, on your knees
You, get on your knees
I said, on your knees
Get on your knees and pray to the cowgod

Eat my burger, for it is my flesh
And drink my milk, for it is my blood
Obey the cowgod
