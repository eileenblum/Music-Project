Follow your nose, it always knows
The flavor of death where ever it goes

Terror in the supermarket, shoppers are in horror,
Shredded boxes in the aisles, corpses on the floor,
Those who ran, this joy is mine, now they're going to pay,
Super gory slaughter now the order of the day!

Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.

Follow your nose, it always knows
The flavor of death where ever it goes

Orphaned at the age of five, parental guidance missed,
Rice Crispies wouldn't talk to him and he got really pissed,
The remittal chemicals have driven him insane,
Now we know the calling like it's ringing 'round his brain,

Snap! Crackle! Pop!

Part of your nutritious breakfast!
