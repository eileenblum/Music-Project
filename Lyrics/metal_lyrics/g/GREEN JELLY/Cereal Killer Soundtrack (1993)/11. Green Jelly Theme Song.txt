Got nothin' to do on a Friday night
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Ain't got no talent, but that's all right
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
We're the worst, the worst in the land
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
But come on! Gotta give us a hand
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Iggy and Gerdy, they're both good names
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Maynard and Poopy, they're both insane
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
But when life is just a game who's to blame?
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Green Jello
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Yeah, that's right, we're it
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
We're the world's economic problems. You can blame it all on us
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
It's our fault
(GOD, GREEN JELLO SUCKS!)
Hello, Jello. Green Jello
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Hello, Jello. Green Jello
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Hello, Jello. Green Jello
Hello, Jello. Green Jello
Hello, Jello. Green Jello
Green Jello! Green Jello!
Jell for the future
Jell for the future
Jell for the future
Jell for your future
And scream ''Green!''
Green Jello sucks!
GREEN JELLO SUCKS!
Green Jello sucks!
