Hello, little children, come stand over here
I'm gonna stick you with a hot poo-poo right in the ear
See you boppin' down Melrose with daddy's gold card
I'm gonna hit you in the nose, yea hit you real hard

So I jumped on the bandwagon, big butt tongue waggin'
Rock 'em Sock 'em Robot, jammin' in your butt
White boy, dred bass, funkin' up your face

As I rock out, gonna pop out
Gonna whip my mo-fo sock out
We are trippin' on XTC
Cashin' in on teenage sexuality
Don't you wally bangers wanna be like me?
We are trippin' on XTC
Lemononade, lemononade,  lemononade now
Hallucinogenius [4X]

Are you boys on drugs?

Yeah, Jesus Christ
Yeah, he is nice
Yeah, Jesus Christ
Yeah, he is nice

Nastase is just us [repeat]
I'm never coming down

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
