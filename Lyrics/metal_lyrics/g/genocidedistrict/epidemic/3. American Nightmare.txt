What a waste of life
Knowing that tomorrow will be the same
Realizing that life is a never ending game
That we will never win [2x]

Everyday is another deception
So wake the fuck up

So let's begin to change the American dream
I would rather live than to sleep for all eternity in normality
Thinking I have a real purpose in this life

Believe what you see not what you're fucking told
Open your eyes &amp; let the truth unfold
This is not what I live for

This world [2x]
This worlds population is rising in idiocracy
We thought this was a true American dream
But it turned into a fucking nightmare

United states of ruin, ruin [2x]
United states
All of our hopes &amp; dreams
Buried beneath the ground
Where once stood a nation so worthy &amp; so fucking proud
So long farewell to this place of disharmony &amp; disgrace

Open up your eyes
Bitch
&amp; fucking realize this is not a dream
This is your reality
