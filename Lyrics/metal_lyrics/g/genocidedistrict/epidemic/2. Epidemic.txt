This is the epidemic
A new kind of hope

We are the faceless plague
Spreading amongst the living dead
We are unknown force
Corrupting the perfecting system
So save your prayers
Get off your knees
&amp; begin to live reality

We are eternal
Salvation for the dead
[2x]

This is the epidemic
A new kind of hope
So if you don't comply
You're on your fucking own

We will reign
Amongst this world of fucking pain
Born from the swine
Born from the Earth
We are here to conquer
Hellbound since birth

We are [2x]
We are the spreading page
We are [2x]
We are the disease within you
