Brought up to be brought down
From the day you're born, you begin demise
Facing struggle, facing the hardship
Of a dead end meaningless life

All for one not one for all
We live in a world where dog eats dog
We wear our emotions on our face
We won't be mortified
We'll never be displaced

We wear our emotions on our face
We won't be mortified
We'll never be displaced

Life is a vicious disease
&amp; death's the only cure

Regurgitated filth of the world
Spit out like the venom of a snake
Extermination of all scum

Life is a vicious disease
Death is the only cure

Reduction of the population
Mass murder to save ones self
[3x]
Reduction of the population
Death wish immortality

Immortality
Extermination of all scum
