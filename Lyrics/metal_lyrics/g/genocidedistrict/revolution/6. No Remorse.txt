No remorse for what I have become
No regrets for the things I have done
No remorse for what I have become

Grasping punishment from a blind past
Born &amp; raised in hostility
Suffering the consequences of life
Death is only the beginning

No remorse
All the positive things in my life have been suppressed by hate
Suppressed by hate
I've slowly let my anger &amp; frustrations
Take ahold of me
Ahold of me

No remorse for what I have become
I let my past fade away
There is no hope for better days
[2x]

No remorse
No remorse for what I have become

I am the Devil's reject
I have fallen from the right hand of God
[2x]
I have fallen from the right hand of God [2x]
