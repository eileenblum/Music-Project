Take a look in the mirror
&amp; face reality
Behind your mask of deception
Lies a coward who will never bare to see
Bitch

How can you be so blind?
When the truth lies before your eyes
[2x]

Fall to realization
You're becoming a victim of your own creation
Bridges will be burnt down
Lies will be stricken
Exposure of your true colors will be the end of you
End of you

Portraying yourself as an innocent being
In order to disguise your ever growing infamy
How can you continue

To demoralize the loyalty of a friend?
Your identity lies dead
Six feet deep

Cry me a river so I can drown you in it

Once a traitor always a traitor
There is no turning back from this point
Pretense of honesty has proven me
You're nothing but a two faced bitch

[Bryan]
You wanna act like a bitch?
I'll treat you like a bitch
This stops now
Bite the fucking curb
Running your mouth &amp; talking shit
The only way to survive you fucking hypocrite

It's people like you who make me sick
So shut your fucking mouth you fucking hypocrite

You're just a two faced bitch
Who will never know
Telling lies will leave you drowning in the undertow

It's people like you who make me sick
So shut your fucking mouth
You fucking hypocrite
