You are just another face in the crowd

You walk in shame as you sell your soul
To society promising allegiance
Shaking hands with conformity
Extinguishing the flame that burns within you
You have lost your place
In this fucking world

You are alive to die &amp; nothing more
Without your presence it would make no difference

You are the walking dead
You'll never be saved
Trapped in a void that you can't seem to escape
[2x]

You kill all the things
That make you human
Slowly fading away
Just like everyone else
[2x]

You can't be told apart as you follow the crowd
Into the slaughter house

You are the walking dead
You'll never be saved
Trapped in a void that you can't seem to escape

Imitation is ignorance
Envy is suicide
[2x]

Envy is ignorance
Imitation is suicide
[4x]
