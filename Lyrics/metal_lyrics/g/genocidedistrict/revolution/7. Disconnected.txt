Stuck in a state of normality
Longing for an escape,
An easy way out
To rid my mind of these nightmares
&amp; fall into an alternate reflection
Pure desire to cast away
&amp; experience life in another form
The poison of light slowly fades away
As you reach the height
Indulging yourself in a sensation of atrocity
Self worthy &amp; numb to pain
Care levels sink to the core of the Earth

Disconnected from all reality
Numb to the weight of the world

Lost in the motion
Of a demoralized state of mind
No conscious, no control
Disconnected from reality

Vividness in small detail
Absorbed &amp; immersed
In the intense mental odyssey
Lost in the world of my mind &amp; thoughts
Living in a dimension of a dream

Disconnected from all reality
Numb to the weight of the world

Free from reality
Numb to the weight of the world
That compresses me
Never have I felt so fucking alive
Disconnected
[2x]

This where the sidewalk ends
So meet me at the edge of the world

Disconnected from all reality
Numb to the weight of the world
[2x]
