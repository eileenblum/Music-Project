In the state of fear
We find comfort within false hope
Believing any lie that infects the mind
Just to see another day alive

All hope is lost
All faith is forgotten

We are ignorant
Victims of tomorrow
Mindless being slowly led astray
For seeing oneself to swallow some kind of hope
Daily dose of false realities

How can we live in a world
Where there is no confidence?

Generations born in early graves
Populations become unnerving
Ignorance is the New World Order
Damnation is the new salvation

The future always seems promising, promising
Through the eyes of a martyr

No hope, just fear
Face the fact
The end is near
No hope, just fear
Waste away
Judgment is here

Drown yourself in the depths of optimism
For we have been enslaved by fear itself
