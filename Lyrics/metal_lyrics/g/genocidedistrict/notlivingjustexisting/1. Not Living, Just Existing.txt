These walls I've built around me
Are the only things preserving my sanity
I've burnt every bridge I've ever constructed
So what the fuck is the point of my existence?
I'm done playing your fucking games

I'm sick &amp; tired of what life has given me
You've made me everything you told me not to be

This self inflicted pain has left an abyss within me
Making peace with myself will never been an option [2x]

Not living, just existing
I will die a man who has ceased to live

I can't live if I feel like I'm dead
I can't live with these demons in my head

For my whole life I lived a lie
Your deception shoved down my throat
Losing faith in myself opened my fucking eyes
That death is nothing to fear
