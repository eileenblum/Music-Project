Stand tall, never retract. Never been conquered by self.
History is a set of lies, forged on fires and greed.
Take heed of the cloven tone.. strive, face the crowd
Blasphemy and malice.. Malice and rage.

Climb on the mountain side, for formidable fate
Taste the blood, coil and creed.. Virtues of blood.
Nihilistic, lust form steel.. Quest over time.
Stakes over, steel and thunder Twice over fire.

Mists of death - Morbid procession
Gleaming torches - Hellfire spell
Switch the blade - Ritualistic slaughter
The reaper waits - In your darkest realm
