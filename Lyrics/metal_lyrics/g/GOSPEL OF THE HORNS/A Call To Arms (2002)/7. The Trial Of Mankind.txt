Call me what you will, but i'll not die for your god 
Our hell is a seed sown from the bile of the jahweh heaven 
This pathetic kingdom of lies, fills a river which runs red 
Sadistic, cruelty glows through the angel of light 
Lying under descending skies, my soul in agony 
Take your own sorry slaves 
To your shameful heaven 

This is a new age, a glorious rebirth 
The age of retribution, my tears carry me away 
This is a new age, a glorious rebirth 
The age of retribution, the trial of god 

Fire, scorching flames 
Desire, black embrace 

Beliefs so primitive and pagan 
That dance with the stars 
A voyage to a place they call misery 
But it is they who suffer 
The everlasting scars 

This is a new age, a glorious rebirth 
The age of retribution, my tears carry me away 
This is a new age, a glorious rebirth 
The age of retribution 
The trial and conviction of god
