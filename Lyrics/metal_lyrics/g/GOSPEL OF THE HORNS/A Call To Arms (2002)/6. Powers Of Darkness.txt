Your fear can no longer hide 
Feel the wrath 
Of darkness tonight 
Angels of death arise 
The eternal powers 
Of darkness unite 
The powers of darkness unite us 
The powers of darkness unite us as one 
Power, darkness unite us 
The powers of darkness unite us as one 

POWER.. the power to be invincible 
POWER.. to stand alone in a crowd 
POWER.. it's everlasting, forever damning 
POWER.. the power to be invincible 

Our battle hymn will roar as thunder 
Full of mixed emotions and pride 
Like soldiers 
Dug into their trenches 
Prepared for relentless war
