The seductive charm of innocence 
Rapes your train of thought 
A callous web of entrapment 
The blind lead the blind... you know what I mean 
Well i'm here to tell you 
We must fight.. it's time to arrest the cold steel 
And plunge it deep into their hearts 

Repel the kiss of Judas 
Our day of judgement is now 
Asphyxiate the cancer 
Piece by piece 
We shall not run nor hide 
We move in the silence of night 
From the corners of this world we ride 
Victory or Valhalla we ride 

Our hate is justified 
In awe their faces bleed 
No bounds will break thy will 
Chaos beyond belief 

GLORY AWAITS... 
GLORY AWAITS US 
GLORY IS AT HAND! 

Chaos bringer
