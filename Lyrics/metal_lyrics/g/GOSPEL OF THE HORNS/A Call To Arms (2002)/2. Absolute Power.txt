We are the hatred 
Lucifer's fury combined 

We are the abominations 
The curse of mankind 
Supreme, extreme, undivine 
We're here to suppress 
To extinguish the lies 
Brandish the steel 
The pestilence through time 

Activate! Dominate! Obliterate! Crush! 

Some things never change 
Achievement comes through absolute power 

Frozen in place, in high delirium 
A taste of splendid victory 
Towards the shadows of the woods 
Deep into the centre of the mystery
