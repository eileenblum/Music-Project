Heightened pleasure, blackened name 
Cataclysmic rush, engulfs thy veins 
Falling into nothingness 
As you're chasing the sun 

Darkened shadows, form a haunting maze 
Night shreds the light, eyes of fire 
The bite of the serpent, the final verdict 
A venomous fate... 

Vengeance is mine 

Ride the wings of eternal pain 
Ride on forever sin after sin... aaauuuuugh... 

Shower me with lust 
And I shall give you timeless sin 
In the slumber of my bloodred hands 

Chaotic frenzy, nihilistic flames 
The temple of virtues, burns the temple of shame
