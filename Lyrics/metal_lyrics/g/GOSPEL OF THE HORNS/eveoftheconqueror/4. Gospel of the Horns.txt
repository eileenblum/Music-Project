The symposium of knowledge
Encompass this still night
Exhume the devil within you
Gospel of the horns... (from the abyss we have returned)

Reach inside your dark wandering soul
Follow the darkened path to your destiny
Wielding the fire brand with malice
In a bloody tide of crimson courage

The tide has swung for the audacious and brave
Never destructive to one's own interests
The hammer will fall strongly wielded with both hands
For an iron will is the will to succeed

The hammer, the hammer will fall
Splitting the boundaries of life and death as we know
Cause we're a force, a force to be reckoned with
A force, a force to be reckoned with...
