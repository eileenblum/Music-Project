Whiplash comes easy
To the spineless and the weak
Envenom the foundations
Deceitful and false...
Blood shall be spilt

The morbid fascination to the chimes of the knell
Summoned by the charm of a soul that is blameless
Enriched monuments of descending virtues
To become embroiled succumbing to temptation

Whiplash comes easy
To the spineless and the weak
Envenom the foundations
Deceitful and false

Life or death... it's a flash of the blade, a duel of the sword
Life or death
Life or death... it's a flash of the blade
Life or death
