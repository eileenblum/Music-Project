Sons of valor, consume your fate
I am your blade, condensed in rage
My forthright... bloodied fist
Spellbound salute my realm

[Solo: Masochist]

I'll strike with hate, enrage the curse
I'll toast a praise... blood for blood

[Chorus 1:]
My hallowed turf is bathed in sweat,
Tears and shallow graves
Once mighty here, they came to maim
Reverence the highest claim

[Chorus 2:]
Enter the realm
The realm of the damned
Enter the realm
The realm of the damned

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

ENTER, ENTER, ENTER, ENTER....
The realm of the damned
