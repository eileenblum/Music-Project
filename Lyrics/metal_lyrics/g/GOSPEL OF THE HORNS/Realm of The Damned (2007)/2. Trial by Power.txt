HATE - Forever our motive
Feelings driven by rage
KILL - Is our intention
Steel caps marching from Hades

[Chorus:]
Trial by Power
Trial by Power

WARFARE - Pain and destruction
Rape, pillage and butcher
CARNAGE - Is our true motive
Tightening our grip on this world

[Chorus]

CHAOS - A whirlwind barbaric
Devour the world to its core
SIN - We are sinners
Sinners WILL conquer this world

[Chorus x2]

[Solo: Hexx/Masochist]

STRIKE - Delivered with full force
No mercy, an eye for an eye
CONQUER - The path of triumph
A scorching wrath from hell!!!
