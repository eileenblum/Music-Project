Dark powers... to weave a common goal
Hard as steel, hard as the ground you stand!
What was rotten and now corrupt
Shall be stripped... torn asunder!
A bloodied ravaged cloth
The remnants of betrayal

A mixture of innocence and wickedness
A piercing glare
A tale of another time
RETRIBUTION! [x4]

The torments of sleep, a battle of one's will
Who fails who? The Achilles shield
With or without the hammer of damnation
Bearers of life or death
Onwards reap destruction
Onwards, come on!
Onwards reap destruction
Onwards.... OBLITERATION!!!!!
