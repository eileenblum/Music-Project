Standing in the flames naked I had a vision
My mind was on a trip to inner thoughts
Surrounded by the beautiful ones (in their absolute glory)
In my warpaint I dance to the music (under the sky of diana)

My body is covered in blood
Cold endless seasons of darkness

The day shall turn into night
A frost will begin
And a new land shall be born
A new land shall be born
