If I am to die, be it by my own hands
I still would of lived!
"If I am to die..."

What is life? ...a passage to my demise
What is death? ...a passage to my demise

Darkness is confort
And whilst enshrouded in it, I'm at ease,
To be myself under nights sky (what a majestic dream)
"This earthly grave that I lie upon awaite"

It is immortality I seek
Immortality to me is living life
A god to myself and myself only!
Immortality, the Satanist's dream

What is life? ...a passage to my demise
What is death? ...a passage to my demise

I have gone so far, I can no longer go on
This daylight, it brings tears to my eyes
I have fallen...let it be!
