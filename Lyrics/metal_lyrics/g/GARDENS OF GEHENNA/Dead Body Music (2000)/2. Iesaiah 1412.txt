Aqua et igni interdictus
in saecula seculorum.
Damnant quod non intelligunt,
oderint dum metuant.
How art thou fallen from heaven,
oh Lucifer, son of the morning.
A confident of your regent
born from beauty, first of them all,
a prince, a dignatory
before your sudden fall.
You always were wondering
why the best don't reach the crown,
what's the reason for the triumph
of the weakest and slowest?
Aqua et igni interdictus
in saecula seculorum.
Damnant quod non intelligunt,
oderint dum metuant.
How art thou fallen from heaven,
oh Lucifer, son of the morning.
You tried to change the rules,
you tried to prove there is no reason
to condemn wisdom and perception,
and that the thirst for knowledge is not high treason.
The seventh day they came to judge you,
the pigeons tried to slay the falcon.
You were the first of all who bled,
when heaven lost it's innocence.
Damned forever, 
sentenced, cursed,
'cause they do not understand.
But may they hate as long as they fear.
How art thou fallen from heaven,
oh Lucifer, son of the morning.
