Warm shadows put their arms around me
when the night comes falling down.
When darkness is a single tear
I wear my sadness like a crown.
Convoke my pain back to the court,
I am the king of all my fears,
and I'm waiting, moribund,
for the blackness comeing near.
I had to fight with the monster inside,
the poison spread by the beast in my head.
And I`ve decided to give back my life,
'cause there must be a better reality.
The night is oppressive and all the creatures
of former nightmares gather around.
Beautiful blackness falls upon me
now that finally I`ve found
a way out of this vale of woe,
a chance to start again in a different way,
to leave behind all agony.
In beautiful blackness I will stay.
I had to fight with the monster inside,
the poison spread by the beast in my head.
And I`ve decided to give back my life,
'cause there must be a better reality.
