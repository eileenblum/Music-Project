And while the sun is falling I drink
to the eclipse of my mind,
each breath's a torture, I'm sinking
into bittersweet oblivion.
Giants we were, inaccessible,
out of the reach of gods and demons,
heroes we were, in shining armour,
full of confidence and belief.
And while the red stones cry I fall
into a world of grey.
Into the stiffened silence I call
for me, for you, for us.
And while the tide is low I try
to get to the other side.
You left me behind, I'm crying
while the flood is drowning me.
Majesties we were, full of glory,
in a crystal solitude,
martyrs we were, bleeding as one,
you for long, me forever.
And while the red stones cry I fall
into a world of grey.
Into the stiffened silence I call
for me, for you, for us.
