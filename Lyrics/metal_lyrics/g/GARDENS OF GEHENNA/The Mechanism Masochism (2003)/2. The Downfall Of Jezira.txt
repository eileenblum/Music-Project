[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

blood from our blood
flesh from our flesh
spirit from our spirit
death from our grace
now it's the downfall of Jezira.

they may try it all their lives
to become a bit like us
they may live a million years
but they will never understand

for in darkness we rule
for in ages we roam
for in silence we grow
and we wait

a dark fire we'll be
a cold floating stream
an impermeable fog
a galaxy

a miracle we are,
unforgettable.
a promise unspoken,
a curse

the gods have left the burning heavens,
the angels have fallen to earth and died
now it's the downfall of Jezira.
