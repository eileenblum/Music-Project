[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

you are not there anymore
where you used to be
but you are wherever I am

here in my heart
there's no more love
there's no belief
in heaven above

here in my mind
there's sorrow and pain
here is my life
poor and in vain

from a distance I hear voices
words that I remember well
spoken in another world
a million light years back in time

there`s an echo of emotions
lived through in another life
a dimension long forgotten
maybe in another me

a look in my eyes tells you about hidden secrets
the blood on my hands shows where I've been
the words I don't speak run from darkest desires
the scars on my soul talk of what I've seen

from a dark and bitter silence
shadows rise so grey and cold
and long before the time was born
those dark, forbidden things were old

you are not there anymore
where you used to be
but you are wherever I am
