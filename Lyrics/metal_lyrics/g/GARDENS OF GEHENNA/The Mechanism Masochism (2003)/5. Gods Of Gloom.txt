[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

there is something going on
and it's rough
and it's cruel
and it's deeply satisfying

there is something from inside
that is huge
that is cruel
that is something that you'll never understand.

somewhere beyond the far horizon
the gods of gloom and gore arise
where from an everlasting wound
bleeding are the western skies

the darkness talks, if you do listen
the silence will dance at times
if you don't live within this world
you'll never know about the fight
that's fought within myself so often,
you'll never know what demons dream
how wolves became a part of me,
how crows and ravens rule the night.

watch me rise
as I celebrate your decay
watch me grow
as I fall
and pray
