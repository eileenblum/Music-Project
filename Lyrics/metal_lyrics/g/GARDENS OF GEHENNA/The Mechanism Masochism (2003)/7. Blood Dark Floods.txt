[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

born from illusions, bread by dreams
no one can follow us.
we were gone before we came, alone, eternal
dark and damned

don't ever try to understand
no consolation
and when we reach what we came for
it won't be a victory,

it's just the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
you have given back hell to me
and I will keep it now and forever
my mechanism masochism

as long as you sit calm and small
you'll never feel the chains
and then we'll create ourselves a god
without whom we cannot live.
at night like a big black beast
with scars and blood dark floods

there's the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
you have given hell back to me
and I will keep it now and forever
my mechanism masochism
