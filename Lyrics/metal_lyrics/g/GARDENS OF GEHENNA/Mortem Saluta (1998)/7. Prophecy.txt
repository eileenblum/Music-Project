You'll talk to the wolves,
have the eyes of the night,
the tongue of the ravens,
you'll have the second sight.

You'll hear the trees whisper
to the stars and the moon
about the great alterations
coming up soon.

The eminence of darkness
you will understand,
you'll be part of the secret
that will outlast the land.

I tell your fortune.
Hunter and hunted you'll be.
Death and Tower and Swords
are your destiny.

When the earth will burst open
to wolve down the light 
to spit forth its bowels
into the vast night.

When heaven and hell
and earth will be burning 
you will have foreseen it,
waiting for it, yearning.

But you will not perceive
what the signs mean at all
that you're insignificant 
and will perish and fall.

I tell your fortune.
Hunter and hunted you'll be.
Death and Tower and Swords
are your destiny.
