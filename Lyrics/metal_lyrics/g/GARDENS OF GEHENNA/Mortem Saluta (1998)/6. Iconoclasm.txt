Not every life ends with death,
some banes outlast the endless sleep.
Sometimes the spirit is too strong,
sometimes emotions are too deep.

I scorn you past the end of life
and still from the depth of deepest hell
I'll spit forth my hate against you,
mighty and irrevocable.

Here I stand, upright I'll die.
I won't submit to anyone.
I won't share servility.
I'm called to account by myself or no-one.

To bear witness of the truth ,
I call my life, my agony.
My tears shall hallow my promise,
I curse you for eternity.

You cowards, you toadies.
Me
I'm God
I'm Satan
I am
you're not worthy of touching my shadow
as long as you follow your hams.

Here I stand, upright I'll die.
I won't submit to anyone.
I won't share servility.
I'm called to account by myself or no-one
