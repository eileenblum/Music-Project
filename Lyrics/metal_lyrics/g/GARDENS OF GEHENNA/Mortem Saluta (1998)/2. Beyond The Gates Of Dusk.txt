Beyond the night, deep in the darkness
i'm waiting,hidden from the light
to show you foreign lands of horror,
to be your guide into the night.

I show you realms you've never heard of,
where mountains meet a bloody sky,
where fallen angels gorge the corpse,
where shadows grow...

A world belonging to sleep, 
to dreams and their inhabitants.
A world abysmal cruel and evil,
full of your curses descendants.

This world and also what's beyond
arises from your imagination,
but the forces that you dread
won't come without an invocation.

Consider well what you desire,
maybe your wishes become true
and anything you once imagined,
you'll meet again and again...

In the world belonging to sleep,
to dreams and their inhabitants.
A world abysmal cruel and evil,
full of your curses descendants.

There is an endless stairway down
to the dungeon of your mind,
and you should walk quite cautiously
if you don't know what you will find.

There are borders which you shouldn't cross,
unless you know you're strong enough,
on your journey into the void,
when you have passed the gates of dusk...

To the world abysmal cruel and evil,
full of your curses descendants.
