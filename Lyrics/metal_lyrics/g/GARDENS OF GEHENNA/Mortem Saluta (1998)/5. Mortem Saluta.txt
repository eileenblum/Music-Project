Mortem saluta,
Cry, beauty,cry,
no-one can hear you.
Pray, precious, pray.
For a sudden end, precious, pray.
Peritura mortem saluta.

Secrets you have told me
and dreams I've trusted in
turned to plagues and demons
and they haunt me and they grin.
They're like a touch of darkened wings.
They demand a sacifice.
They can't be banished from my brain
and they laugh at me again.

Mortem saluta,
Cry, beauty,cry,
no-one can hear you.
Pray, precious, pray.
For a sudden end, precious, pray.
Peritura mortem saluta.

The higher you fly, 
the deeper is the fall.
Teh more you have had,
the less stays at all.
If never you laughed,
then never you'll mourn.
You'll never be lonely,
if you've ever been alone.

Mortem saluta,
Cry, beauty,cry,
no-one can hear you.
Pray, precious, pray.
For a sudden end, precious, pray.
Peritura mortem saluta.
