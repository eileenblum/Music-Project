[Lyrics by Boltendahl]

We're standing in the first row
Raising our fist
Sreaming at our idols
Coming out of the mist

Like a thunder from the sky
Rolling on the stage
Metal Monsters are unleashed
Fighting side by side

For Metal we live
For Metal we'll die
We are riding the sky
Til the morning light

All for one
And all for Metal
Metal will never die
We rock until the dawn
With endless power
Metal will never die
Metal will never die

No time to wait, get out on the road
And never give up
Time to burn, time to learn
Every second we yearn 

For Metal we live
For Metal we'll die
We are riding the sky
Til the morning light

All for one
And all for Metal
Metal will never die
We rock until the dawn
With endless power
Metal will never die
Metal will never die

All for one
And all for Metal
Metal will never die
We rock until the dawn
With endless power
Metal will never die
Metal will never die

All for one
And all for Metal
Metal will never die
We rock until the dawn
With endless power
Metal will never die
Metal will never die
