[Lyrics by Boltendahl]

The beast is on the rampage
Blood and gore he leaves behind
Insanity is with him
His mind is still unkind

Humans (sung: Mortals) live in fear and sorrow
Darkness falls, the daylight dies
The kingdoms down, there is no tomorrow
Screams disturbs the night

Ancient words of evil times
Passed on through the centuries
Written down in blood and anger
Created for eternity

Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast

In misery we scream - salvation
The king calles for the warriors
Mother and son brought us damnation
The hero as a savior

Beowulfs sword just killed Grendel
Grendel's (sung: his) mother is out for revenge
She dies by the hand of the hero (sung: Both die killed by the hero)
Legacy is past, times for a change

Ancient words of evil times
Past on through the centuries
Written down in blood and anger
Created for eternity

Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast

Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast

Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
Rage Of The Savage Beast
