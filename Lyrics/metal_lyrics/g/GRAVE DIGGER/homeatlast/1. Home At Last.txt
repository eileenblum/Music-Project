[Lyrics by Boltendahl]

Time has come, my journey is at the end
Years i have travelled, lost a lot of friends
At the walls of Troy, i have fought for my king
Achilles by my side for the faith to win

Saints and sinners
Liars and killers
Gods and heroes (sung: devils)
Crossed my ways

Home At Last, goodbye to the past
Home At Last, our faith is hard and fast
Home At Last, tied to the past
Home At Last, home At Last

The end of the day brought us the victory
We paid for our sins with pain and misery

Saints and sinners
Liars and killers
Gods and heroes (sung: devils)
Crossed my ways

Home At Last, goodbye to the past
Home At Last, our faith is hard and fast
Home At Last, tied to the past
Home At Last, home At Last 

Home At Last, goodbye to the past
Home At Last, our faith is hard and fast
Home At Last, tied to the past
Home At Last, home At Last

Home At Last, goodbye to the past
Home At Last, our faith is hard and fast
Home At Last, tied to the past
Home At Last, home At Last
