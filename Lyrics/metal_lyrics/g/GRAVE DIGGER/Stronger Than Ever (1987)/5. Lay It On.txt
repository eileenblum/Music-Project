I was wrong
but baby that was yesterday
said I was sorry
tell me what more can I say

If you're still sore
please tell me what more can I do
to make it up
so I can get it on with you

Let's cut this kid's stuff
'cause it's driving me insane
switch off the lights
let's go to bed again

Lay it on
Lay your love on me

When you're mad at me
It really turns me on
I love the breakups
'cause the making up is fun

Let's swim in passion
till we drown in ecstasy
you know I need you
just as much as you need me

My heart is pounding
only yearning for your touch
don't keep me waiting
I might just blow up
