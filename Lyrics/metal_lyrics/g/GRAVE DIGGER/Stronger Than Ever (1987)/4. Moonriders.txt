I felt this yearning since the day I was born
I wanted more than just to fly
it's been the rhythm of an engine - so wild
a driving force that ruled my live

I want your power on a planet in the sky
you are the ace for me and so I'm running wild

When I look behind
I see your face
You know it's time to run
it's a long way to hell
Moonriders

I saw you moving slowly into the night
I needed more than just your soul
we took the road straight ahead for a mile
you've got my power in your hands

A journey through space and time
just you and I
Moonriders in the sky
