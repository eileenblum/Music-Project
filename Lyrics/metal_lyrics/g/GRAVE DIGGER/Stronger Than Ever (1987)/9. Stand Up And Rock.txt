Another boring evening
where nothing's going on
then suddenly the phone rings
could this mean time for fun
we take off to the Palais
that's where the action is
everybody's waiting
for the show to begin

The band is really rocking
the crowd roars out for more
that's unaffected feeling
from kids of rock 'n' roll

Stand up and rock
Stand up and rock

When lights dim down we feel it
our heroes are in town
the tension mounts they're on stage
we'll never be alone
we get just what we wanted
the music's straight and loud
the temperature is rising
the air vibrates the sound

A late night rock invasion
yes we were born to rock
we're living for the moment
and we'll never give it up
tomorrow doesn't matter
we'll take it as it comes
as long as we can stand up
we'll rock the whole night long
