Jimmy and Jenny lived together
from January '84 till December '85
he was a rock and roll ladies' man
she was only 19 when she died

I played in bands with Jimmy
he used to get heavy from time to time
I didn't like the way he treated Jenny
I can still hear her cry

Don't leave me lonely
don't leave me alone

Don't leave me lonely
I can't make it on my own

Jimmy used to laugh about her
those girls are all the same
love them and leave them
that's the name of the game

He sure could play those drums
but the love game he couldn't play
he was a bastard to poor Jenny
and I can still hear her cry to this day
