Hey now, baby listen to me
we can't go on this way
baby try to understand me
don't let our love fade away

Come on, come on, come on baby,
come on, come on, don't be shy

Stay till the morning
let's make love tonight
Stay till the morning
girl I'll treat you right
it's gonna be alright

I can't take these long discussions
they always end in tears
baby what's the use in fighting
let's sort it out right here and now

There's no time for playing jealous
that's for kids at school
we've got something going for us
hey stay cool oooh
