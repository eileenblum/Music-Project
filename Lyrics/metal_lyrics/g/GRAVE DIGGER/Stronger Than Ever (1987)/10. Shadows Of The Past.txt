I once gave my heart and soul
Why - I wanna know
You've got what you were looking for
You enjoyed your show

Sacrifice you - without warning
Not for you - I can't take it
Now you're gone - I will make it
All night long - I won't miss you

Shadows of the past
Returned from nowhere I stand
Shadows of the past
Alone you'll be in the end

I found out you never mean
Anything you say
You're the kind who tries to tease
Then you run away

Today I found my destiny
I was just you fool
There's another place for me
Now I know the truth
