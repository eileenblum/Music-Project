It's been a year or so
since I was here in town
you were a part of that crowd
saw me getting right on down

I'm such a bad, bad boy
want your body not your soul
but I won't stay forever
'cause I run a travellin' show

Do you wanna feel my fever
everybody wants to rock

I want to keep my freedom
I want some fun - that's all
you don't believe I'm sorry
'though I have told you so

Do you wanna feel my fever
everybody wants to rock

Listen to the music
everybody wants to rock
Make love to the music
you're gonna dance the whole night long

Listen to the music
everybody wants to rock
Do it to the music
I wanna rock you all night long

I'm still a bad, bad boy
want your body not your soul
tonight you might just score
hanging 'round my backstage door
