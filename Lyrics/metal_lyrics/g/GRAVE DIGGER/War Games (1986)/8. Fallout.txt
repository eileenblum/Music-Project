Then their time had come
No warning from a bell too late to run
As they shriek up at night
Hear the falling of the bombs
See the frightened ones
When the flames rise high
ThereÂ´s nowhere to hide no safe place inside
No more shelter in town
Try to hide in the fields
Dig a hole in the ground

Fallout fallout fallout fallout fallout fallout 
Fallout fallout yeah yeah yeah

Now itÂ´s time to die
Darkness all around they wonder why
They will no longer live
No longer fly high itÂ´s their final cry
When the world is on fire
Lungs getting tightened
They canÂ´t stand the heat
No more tears to cry
Farewell and goodbye humanity dies

Fallout fallout fallout fallout 
Fallout fallout fallout fallout 

Fallout fallout fallout fallout 
Fallout fallout fallout fallout 

When the flames are gone the pain lingers on
TheyÂ´ve damaged their brains
ThereÂ´s no clean blue sky
They canÂ´t breathe the air
They canÂ´t see the sun
They lay down on the ground
TheyÂ´re heading towards an early grave
No new day will occur
The nightÂ´s due to stay the pain will remain

Fallout fallout fallout fallout fallout fallout 
Fallout fallout yeah yeah fallout
