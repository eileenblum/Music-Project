Soldier of truth he seems so cool
Feels the sound of a gun
GodÂ´s by your side lies or truth
He wanna to find out tonight
Walking through the night
At that day of great fire
HeÂ´s prepared to strive for his rights
Fight for your life dayÂ´s out of sight
Stepping outside he runs wild

Enola Gay Enola
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life

What does he know orders said so
Does he have the right to kill you
Days on the run life becomes fun
Watch out thereÂ´s no time to lose
Flying through the night
At this day of great fire
In this night he is going to find the truth
Gun equals right the stronger will survive
They told him right is on your side

Enola Gay Enola
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life

Enola Gay Enola
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life

Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb fighting for your life
Drop the bomb flight into the night
Drop the bomb
