Nights will return on your ways we will go
TimeÂ´s passing by until night turns to black
Wait til itÂ´s dawn when itÂ´s time to go on
Days come and go as the aims we pursue

Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait

Die when youÂ´re young all the time we are lonely
Night time is right whatÂ´s the time I donÂ´t know

Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait

Nights will return on a day cold as ice
No time to lose one sweet day we will shine 

Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait until tomorrow
Heaven can wait
