Wait tonight
Your feelings spending bright
Inbreeding of the life by brutal through

Wheels of fire
Someone take higher
Cold places but you are never know

Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking

Sing don't stop
So rock me take you down
Untesting the sacred high test you

Feel the power
The blast magic war
Excusing the dagger inside of you

Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking

Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
Keep on rocking, keep on rocking
