Dark cold tomorrow will you ever learn
Blinded by light youÂ´ll never know
Cold winds are blowing time will never heal
Where is the sun youÂ´ll never learn

Playing fools now itÂ´s time to die
Playing fools their time to die
Playing fools they are on the run
Playing fools donÂ´t turn around around

Way down the coast did you ever know
Recall the times remember well
Clouded grey heaven blindness over you
What are you doing turn around

Playing fools now itÂ´s time to die
Playing fools their time to die
Playing fools they are on the run
Playing fools donÂ´t turn around around

Playing fools now itÂ´s time to die
Playing fools their time to die
Playing fools they are on the run
Playing fools donÂ´t turn around around

Dark cold tomorrow blinded by light
Cold winds are blowing
Where is the sun tonight

Playing fools now itÂ´s time to die
Playing fools their time to die
Playing fools they are on the run
Playing fools donÂ´t turn around around

Playing fools now itÂ´s time to die
Playing fools their time to die
Playing fools they are on the run
Playing fools donÂ´t turn around around
