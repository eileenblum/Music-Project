Shadows on the wall cold as ice
DonÂ´t break my heart too many times
I donÂ´t want to lose you you passing by
I canÂ´t live without you in the night
I just canÂ´t forget you love still lives on
No new tomorrow when youÂ´re gone

Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart

LivinÂ´ seems so strange since youÂ´re gone
You left my feelings far behind
In my daydreams deep in my mind
I feel your poison makes me blind

Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart

I donÂ´t want to lose you you passing by
Oh I canÂ´t live without you in the night 
Oh no no oh no no no

Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart my heart
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart

Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart my heart
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart again
Love is breakinÂ´ my heart
