We want to rock your bodies
Since we started the whole show
We want to rock your bowels
After all itÂ´s rockÂ´nÂ´roll

We wanna go some further
In a way youÂ´ve never known
We wanna rock your spirits
Like we never did before

We wanna roll it we wanna roll it

Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside

We want to rock your bodies
Since we started the whole show
We want to rock your bowels
After all itÂ´s rockÂ´nÂ´roll

We wanna go some further
In a way youÂ´ve never known
We wanna rock your spirits
Like we never did before

We wanna roll it we wanna roll it

Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside

Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
Let your heads roll
Let your brains burn inside
So let your heads roll
So let your brains burn inside
So let your heads roll
