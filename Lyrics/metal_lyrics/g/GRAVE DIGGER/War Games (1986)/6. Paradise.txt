Places so sweet
I have never seen before
And these days IÂ´ll recall
If someday I should return

The sun up above
Shines a light IÂ´ve never known
And at night when stars rise
By that time you never grow tired

Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise
Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise

A night long ago 
Which I never will forget
Sunny days were in sight
Filled with kindness no regrets

Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise
Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise
Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise

Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise

But itÂ´s no longer true
Â´cause of hatred in the world
Only mankind can tear
Wounds that time can never heal

Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise
Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise
Living in a paradise see the light
Living in a paradise
