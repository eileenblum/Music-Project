Blood is all you want 
Sometimes when youÂ´re alone
Your eyes twinkle like a knife
So take my blood take my seal
My love itÂ´s alright

Someday weÂ´ll find by day or by night
The knife in between your eyes
IÂ´ll take your blood take your seal the love

Night comes over you itÂ´s light years ago
That look still lives in your eyes
No more blood no bad seed 
What love nothingÂ´s right

Fire fire in your eyes 
Fire fire in your eyes 
Fire fire in your eyes 

HateÂ´s on your mind by day and by night
A knife in between your eyes
YouÂ´ll spread more blood
Spread bad seed what love

Fire fire in your eyes 
Fire fire in your eyes 
Fire fire in your eyes

Fire fire in your eyes 
Fire fire in your eyes 
Fire fire in your eyes
Fire fire in your eyes
