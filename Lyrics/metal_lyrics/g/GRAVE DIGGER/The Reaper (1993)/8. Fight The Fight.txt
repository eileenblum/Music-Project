Raging on a warpath, storming through the town
Blowing it to pieces, killing all around
Fighting for existence, looking for a way
Now it's getting harder, it's the price you pay

Black or white - it's no different kind
Black or white - the leader are so blind

Fight the fight
Fight for your right
Fight the fight
And see the light

Crossing bloody streets, waiting for attack
Living for a moment, never turning back
Striking down the white, killing all in sight
It's a state of hate, where fires burning bright
