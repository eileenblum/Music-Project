I wanna know it, I tell no lies
I wanna choose my life the way I mean
Now can you see it? Now can you feel it?
We break the rules for Rock'n Roll

Live fast - die young
Don't live for nine to five
Work hard - die young
I don't wanna close my eyes

Under my flag - you'll gonna win
Under my flag - you'll never loose again

Over and over straight to the top
We're all the bad, bad boys, but we enjoy
You can't believe it, we'll make your day
And we'll make your wish, that you've never been born
