Young and free, it's a crazy scene
Evil's smile between your eyes
Eye to eye and back to back
You can't escape as the sun turns to black

Hot tonight - I wanna know
what you feel inside
Hot tonight - Your eyes are
full of lies

Play Your Game
Play Your Game
Play Your Game
Play Your Game ...
...And Kill

Never again, I won't see your hands
fear is everywhere you stand
We all live in a state of hate
We're so blind but that's our fate
