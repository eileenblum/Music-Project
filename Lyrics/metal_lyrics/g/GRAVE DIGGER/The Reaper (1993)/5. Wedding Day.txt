I need you here beside me,
To chase the night way
I need your love to guide me,
Save through another day

Oh, oh, oh it's my wedding
Day, oh, oh, oh

Wedding day - all night we gonna burn
Wedding day - the day of no return
It's my wedding day

She's hyperactive and she's a wild romance
I want to kiss her, but she only wanna dance
I've waited all the time for you
You've broken promises, I'm just a fool for you

Start trouble, spread pain
Piss and venom in your veins
Talk nasty, breath the fire
Smell rotten, you're a liar
