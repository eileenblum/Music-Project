Politician idiots, cruel warriors
Backstreet suckers
Holy terror, deadly masters
Bring us pain, anger and destruction

What you need is what you get
What you get is what you need
What you do is what you did
What you did is what you do

Can't you see - oh can't you see
The devil plays piano
Marching armies, machine killers
Lying prayers, hell is waiting
Holy terror, deadly masters
Bring us pain, anger and destruction

Politicians idiots, cruel warriors
Backstreet suckers
What you need is what you get
What you get is what you need
