You're living in a world of sin
Eyes like a blood red sky
You know how you feel
The speed of light trapped in your eyes

The world around you
It's not the Promised land
"H" comes to rule the world
"H" comes to rule the world

Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler Mr.H.
Ruler

You look into the past
Lost dreams of broken hearts
You fool, it's up to you
Change your way to a better life
