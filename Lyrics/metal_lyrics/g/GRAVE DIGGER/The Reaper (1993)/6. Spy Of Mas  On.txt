You're the prince of evil
And hate rule your mind
You're the priest of fate
Satan lives behind your eyes

Believe you're never win
Keep away from me
Lies you tell
Hear the bell
You're time has come

Spy Of Mas'On

You're the king of pain
A loser of your own
A creature of blood
And a friend of no one
