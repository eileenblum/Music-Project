Cruel times, war times
Senseless killing without end
Thousands die in trenches
And bullets kill my friend

No water for the living
No graves for the dead
No faith to leave this hell
Flee this evil spell

In this moment, I feel no pain
Only fear to lose my mind
I think about you again and again
Before I'm going blind

We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end

We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end

Many falling day by day
Dying is the only way
Brothers pass before my eyes
No one hears my useless cries

No faces in the mirror
Skulls without pride
Hope is far away and dead
God is buried by my side

In this moment, I feel no pain
Only fear to lose my mind
I think about you again and again
Before I'm going blind

We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end 

We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end 

[Solo]

War is the devil, war is the devil, war is the devil
The evil of mankind

In this moment, I feel no pain
Only fear to lose my mind
I think about you again and again
Before I'm going blind

We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end 

We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end
