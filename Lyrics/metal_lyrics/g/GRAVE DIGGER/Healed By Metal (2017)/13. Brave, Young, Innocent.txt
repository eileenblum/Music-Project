In my dreams, I hear your voice
I see your face next to mine
Far away a silent call
Immortal songs of rise and fall

As a falcon you will fly
Can't believe that you died
An arrow hit your chest
Forced your body down to rest

The world turns round and round
When rain starts falling down
A last farewell
In the blood red sunset
Times we never will forget
The brave, young and innocent

Cold winds surround my soul
Demons try to take control
I'm lost in the endless grey
I lope that you'll come back one day

When storm comes up I face the battle
Call the gods for absolution
In my heart, I stand the fear
Words of wisdom I can hear

The world turns round and round
When rain starts falling down
A last farewell
In the blood red sunset
Times we never will forget
The brave, young and innocent
