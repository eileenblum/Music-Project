We love the way we live
We are so hot, can't get enough
We hang around and cool down
We ride our bikes through your town

Hundred pounds of metal
Steaming through the shattered night
Roaring wheels cry out for battle
Magic stars our guardian light

Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker

Don't look back and live fast
Never look back into the past
You will never walk alone
One day our names are carved in stone

Hundred pounds of metal
Steaming through the shattered night
Roaring wheels cry out for battle
Magic stars our guardian light

Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker

Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker

[Solo]

Hundred pounds of metal
Steaming through the shattered night
Roaring wheels cry out for battle
Magic stars our guardian light

Lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker

Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
