Around the world in thirty days
I need no help, get of my way
Harder faster, nothing to lose
I believe I got the walkin' blues

God is a liar
Devil's friar
Burn in the fire
Life's my desire

Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me, check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my bucket list

Hurry up, no time to waste
So many things I wanna taste
Reaper's call surprised and scared me
My fortune's gone, I've lost the key 

God is a liar
Devil's friar
Burn in the fire
Life's my desire

Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me, check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my bucket list

[Solo]

God is a liar
Devil's friar
Burn in the fire
Life's my desire

Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me, check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my

Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me, check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my bucket list
