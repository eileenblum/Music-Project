Healed by metal 
Healed by metal

I'm walking on water
Change water to wine
I'm the healer
I'll send you a sign

I change dust into bones
Raise the dead to life
I fight the disease
Come and pray on your knees

We all break out in rage
We're ready for the stage
We live like a rebel
We're all sent by the devil

We are
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal

The blind will see
And the deaf will hear
The dumb will speak
And the lame will walk

We are the law
We are still mesmerized
Leave the fear behind
We save the human kind

We all break out in rage
We're ready for the stage
We live like a rebel
We're all sent by the devil

We are
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal

Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal
