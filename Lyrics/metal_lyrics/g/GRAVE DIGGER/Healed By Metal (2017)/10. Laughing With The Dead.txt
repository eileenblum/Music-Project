I'm sitting at the gates
I'm waiting for the poor lost souls
Hades king of darkness waits
When the last bell tolls

Whispers in the wind
Shattered clouds above the sea
Guardians of the underworld
There's no one left alive but me

In towers of sorrow
We wait for revelation
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below

Laughing with the dead, oho - oho
Laughing with the dead, hahahahaha

On walls of infinity
I'm waiting for their misery
Look behind dark curtains
They carry on the burden

In towers of sorrow
We wait for revelation
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below

Laughing with the dead, oho - oho
Laughing with the dead, hahahahaha
Laughing with the dead, oho - oho
Laughing with the dead, hahahahaha

[Solo]

In towers of sorrow
We wait for revelation
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below

Laughing with the dead, oho - oho
Laughing with the dead, hahahahaha
Laughing with the dead, oho - oho
Laughing with the dead, hahahahaha

Laughing with the dead
Laughing with the dead
Laughing with the dead
Laughing with the dead
