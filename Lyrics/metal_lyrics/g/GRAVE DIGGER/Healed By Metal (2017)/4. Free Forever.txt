Free forever

From a land of snow and ice
Leaving a place like paradise
Living the dreams of the past
We follow the sun, home at last

A march of madness without return
At the horizon fires still burn
We give him the last escort
His death was our last resort

Darkness is our fate
We will die for the brave

The spirit of king will never die
On wings of freedom he rides the sky
He wants to live now or never
His legacy will be free forever

Free forever

We awake with eyes wide open
Believing this nightmare never ends
Is this truth or imagination
Savior of a whole generation 

Darkness is our fate
We will die for the brave

The spirit of king will never die
On wings of freedom he rides the sky
He wants to live now or never
His legacy will be free forever

[Solo]

The spirit of king will never die
On wings of freedom he rides the sky
He wants to live now or never
His legacy will be free forever

Free forever
Free forever
Free forever
