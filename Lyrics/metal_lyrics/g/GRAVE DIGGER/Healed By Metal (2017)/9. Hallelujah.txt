You touch my body, you touch my soul
You are the devil disguise
You pray to god, you praise the devil
You are the effigy of evil

Behind your face, you ever lie
When you touch me, I can't cry
Your words still hurt, you are a liar
Burn in hell you bloody friar

Hallelujah, hallelujah
For your sins you will be crucified
Hallelujah, hallelujah
All my life I praised the day you will die
Hallelujah, hallelujah

You broke my bones, you broke my body
I hate you more than my own life
Deep in my mind I hardly suffer
I will eat twice at your last supper

Hallelujah, hallelujah
For your sins you will be crucified
Hallelujah, hallelujah
All my life I praised the day you will die
Hallelujah, hallelujah 

[Solo]

Hallelujah, hallelujah
For your sins you will be crucified
Hallelujah, hallelujah
All my life I praised the day you will die
Hallelujah, hallelujah
