From the mountains to the sea we hear the battle cries
Enemies not far away, we're standing side by side
Freedom - we won't give up, we never walk alone
We hold our shields high in the sky, never surrender till we die

We ride into the sun
We never hide and never run

We all call for war - no fear of life and death
We all call for war - fight till your last breath
We call for war

Sparks fly high when steel meets steel, we send them straight to hell
Spirit of the grave with us, we take our last farewell

We ride into the sun
We never hide and never run

We all call for war - no fear of life and death
We all call for war - fight till your last breath
We call for war

[Solo]

We all call for war - no fear of life and death
We all call for war - fight till your last breath
We call for war
