In the dark of the night
I kill the rhythm smash the beat
I rise my fist get down on your knees
In the dark of the light
I stand with you side by side
Come and fight with me night by night

Hell over me, hell over you
Keep the faith and stay true

In the heat of the day
We rise the flag and cry out loud
We hold our heads up strong and proud
At the summit of rock
We break the chains and trust our hearts
We feel the power nothing tear us apart

Hell over me, hell over you
Keep the faith and stay true
Stay true

What do you think who we are
Disciples of Satan or something bizarre
For what do you think we fight this battle
We follow the ten commandments of metal

[Solo]

Hell over me, hell over you
Keep the faith and stay true
Stay true

What do you think who we are
Disciples of Satan or something bizarre
For what do you think we fight this battle
We follow the ten commandments of metal 

Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
