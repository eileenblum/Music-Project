A man without name
A grave without corpse
A song without tunes
No signs in the runes

I feel the hate
When I come too late
I see the blood stain
In his face again

What's done is done, when the reaper will come
Graves are open and souls are broken

Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death, death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye

Gallows prepared
All rules are declared
My heart bleeds no longer
And I try to survive

Cry out for the rope
Trust in fear and hope
No rest for the sinner
Death is just a beginner

What's done is done, when the reaper will come
Graves are open and souls are broken

Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death, death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye, the hangman's eye 

[Solo]

Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death, death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye

Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death, death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye, the hangman's eye, the hangman's eye
