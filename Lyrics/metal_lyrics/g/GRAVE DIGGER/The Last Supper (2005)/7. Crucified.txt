What a fool I'm, what a helpless soul
Why I betray him, they are on patrol
What can I do to salve my consciences
I seems that I have to carry the consequences

I'm sitting here, my life is past
I'm wasted my time to heal mankind
I'm waiting here for the final court
I'm knowing now my time is short

FATHER TELL ME WHAT WENT WRONG
MY WHOLE LIFE MY FAITH WAS STRONG
FATHER TELL ME WHY SHOULD I DIE
THIS SCREAMING MOB YELLS CRUCIFY
MY CURSE COMES TRUE I HAVE TO DIE
WHY AM I CRUCIFIED

The walls around me, cold and grey
Cramp my soul, nothing more to say
I gave my life for the human brood
But they ve payed me in blood

With open eyes I confront my fate
I feel no fear, I fell no hate
My death should be a testament
With that my light always shines

FATHER TELL ME WHAT WENT WRONG
MY WHOLE LIFE MY FAITH WAS STRONG
FATHER TELL ME WHY SHOULD I DIE
THIS SCREAMING MOB YELLS CRUCIFY
MY CURSE COMES TRUE I HAVE TO DIE
WHY AM I CRUCIFIED

FATHER TELL ME WHAT WENT WRONG
MY WHOLE LIFE MY FAITH WAS STRONG
FATHER TELL ME WHY SHOULD I DIE
THIS SCREAMING MOB YELLS CRUCIFY
MY CURSE COMES TRUE I HAVE TO DIE
WHY AM I CRUCIFIED
