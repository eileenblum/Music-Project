Blackend days long winter nights
Days without future, days without light
No horizon, no intoxing heat
I'm listening to my lonely hearbeat

My soul has left me,life has changed
Over my head, dark clouds above

THE NIGHT BEFORE I SAW AN EAGLE FLY
THE NIGHT BEFORE I SAW THE EVIL EYE
THE NIGHT BEFORE I HEARD THE BATTLE CRY
THE NIGHT BEFORE I FELT MY SUICIDE

Starring through the open window
Searching for my soulless shadow
He's tumbling around and falling down
He's on a journey out of town

My soul has left me,life has changed
Over my head, dark clouds above
Who can tell me how I can go on
Before I leave into the dawn

THE NIGHT BEFORE I SAW AN EAGLE FLY
THE NIGHT BEFORE I SAW THE EVIL EYE
THE NIGHT BEFORE I HEARD THE BATTLE CRY
THE NIGHT BEFORE I FELT MY SUICIDE

THE NIGHT BEFORE I SAW AN EAGLE FLY
THE NIGHT BEFORE I SAW THE EVIL EYE
THE NIGHT BEFORE I HEARD THE BATTLE CRY
THE NIGHT BEFORE I FELT MY SUICIDE
