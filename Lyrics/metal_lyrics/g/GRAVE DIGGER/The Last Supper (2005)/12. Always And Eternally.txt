Until the end of time, I know you'll be mine
Forever and Ever, we stay together
When thunder and lightning changes love into hate

Until the end of time, the sun will go down
Heaven will rain, upon your crown
When thunder and lightning, changes love into hate

Our curse will come true
Always and Eternally

ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDE
ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE

Until the end of time,
Now spread your wings, strong and mighty
Fly high as you can and touch the sky
When thunder and lightning changes love into hate

Our curse will come true
Always and Eternally

ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDE
ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE

Our curse will come true
Always and Eternally

ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDE
ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE

ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDE
ALWAYS AND ETERNALLY...
WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE
