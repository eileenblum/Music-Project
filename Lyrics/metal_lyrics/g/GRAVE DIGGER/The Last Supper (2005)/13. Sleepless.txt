In my dreams I see the world
Killing yourself and dying slow
Fire and death rules the news
When the beauty has come
Ready start to lose

Stand up fight for your rights
Stand up and shout it out

When sleepless if I close my eyes
When sleepless in this lonely world
When sleepless if I see you on this wall
When helpless what we are looking for
The future is death if we go all the way
What we can't deliver in with politics betrayed
Hunger and terror reflect our days
But hope will never die if the heaven is grey
