Open the door
With your lips kiss the floor
Open your eyes
You're in hell pay the price

Open your mind
Let me see your thoughts behind
Open your mouth
And let me know the truth

The devil rises up
Out of the fire
he calls me a liar

BUT I LIKE TO STAY
HELL TO PAY
THAT'S MY WAY
HELL TO PAY
HELL TO PAY

When angels fly free
I lock up the door and hold the key
When hell is open
My black heart will know what happened

The devil rises up
punishes me with hate
and lead me to the gate

BUT I LIKE TO STAY
HELL TO PAY
THAT'S MY WAY
HELL TO PAY
HELL TO PAY

The devil rises up
punishes me with hate
and lead me to the gate

BUT I LIKE TO STAY
HELL TO PAY
THAT'S MY WAY
HELL TO PAY
HELL TO PAY
