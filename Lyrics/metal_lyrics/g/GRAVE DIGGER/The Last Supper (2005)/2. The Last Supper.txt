Well done my friend, thanks for the offer
We'll catch him at night to end this game
Take these thrity dimes in a coffer
Meet us at midnight, please hold the flame

Believe my days are counted
I feel the evil breath
The liar sits right by my side
His eyes are full of fear and pride

IT'S MY LAST SUPPER
AFTER THIS I WILL DIE
IT'S MY LAST SUPPER
MY OWN SACRIFICE

Welcome my friends
come celebrate with me
You are invited to take a place
Feat and drink as much as you will
Before they start the race of death

Believe my days are counted
I feel the evil breath
The liar sits right by my side
His eyes are full of fear and pride

IT'S MY LAST SUPPER
AFTER THIS I WILL DIE
IT'S MY LAST SUPPER
MY OWN SACRIFICE

My end is near
Come pray with me
My fortune is over
But love can be

Whenever I die
Please let me fly
Remembe me
And love can be

Believe my days are counted
I feel the evil breath
The liar sits right by my side
His eyes are full of fear and pride

IT'S MY LAST SUPPER
AFTER THIS I WILL DIE
IT'S MY LAST SUPPER
MY OWN SACRIFICE
