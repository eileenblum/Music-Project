Out of the cold, they are rising up
Nameless creatures, bent on revenge
They follow blind, a senseless idol
Their religion is black and suicidal

Black is the colour
Black is their mind

BRINGER OF CHAOS
OF FIRE AND STORM
LIFE MEANS NOTHING
DEATH IS THEIR FATE
BLACK WIDOWS KILL PEOPLE
IN THE NAME OF HATE

Like invincible spiders, they creeping around
You can't see them, they're underground
A trail of blood they leave behind
They are a pest for all mankind

Black is the colour
Black is their mind

BRINGER OF CHAOS
OF FIRE AND STORM
LIFE MEANS NOTHING
DEATH IS THEIR FATE
BLACK WIDOWS KILL PEOPLE
IN THE NAME OF HATE

Black Widows
Black Widows
Black Widows kill peolpe
In the name of hate
