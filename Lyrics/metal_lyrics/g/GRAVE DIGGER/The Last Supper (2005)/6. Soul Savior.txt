Leave your life and follow me
Leave your children and touch my dream
I'll show you a world behind the scenes
I'll show you a life far away from what you need

As we touch the horizon and touch the sun
Faith in my religion and spread my beliefs
As we walk on the moon and take the stars from the sky
Believe in my religion and don't ask why

I'M THE HOLY MESSIAH
LET MY SWORD RULE THE EARTH
I'M YOUR SOUL SAVIOR
TURN AROUND AND SPREAD MY WORD
SOUL SAVIOR
SOUL SAVIOR

Take your own blood and follow me
Take your spirit and see my vision
I'll show you my heaven behind the sun
I'll show you my life, you don't have to run

As we touch the horizon and touch the sun
Faith in my religion and spread my beliefs
As we walk on the moon and take the stars from the sky
Believe in my religion and don't ask why

I'M THE HOLY MESSIAH
LET MY SWORD RULE THE EARTH
I'M YOUR SOUL SAVIOR
TURN AROUND AND SPREAD MY WORD
SOUL SAVIOR
SOUL SAVIOR

I'M THE HOLY MESSIAH
LET MY SWORD RULE THE EARTH
I'M YOUR SOUL SAVIOR
TURN AROUND AND SPREAD MY WORD
SOUL SAVIOR
SOUL SAVIOR
