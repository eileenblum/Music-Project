Lost in the no man's land
Died in agony and pain
I raise my hands into the sky
Shattered eyes asking please why?

Why am I
My life to desecrate
Why I am
Travel now to heaven

THE FERRYMAN UNLEASH THE BEAST
I'VE PAID MY ONE WAY FARE
I LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE HOLY PRIEST
MY SCREAMS DISTURBING THE AIR
HE TURNS AROUND AND TAKES MY HAND
LEADING ME
TO MY GRAVE IN THE NO MAN'S LAND

Lost heart in a faithless time
Buried in the deep of the universe
I'm nailed to my own fate
Soulless mind and endless hate

Why am I
My life to desecrate
Why I am
Travel now to heaven

THE FERRYMAN UNLEASH THE BEAST
I'VE PAID MY ONE WAY FARE
I LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE HOLY PRIEST
MY SCREAMS DISTURBING THE AIR
HE TURNS AROUND AND TAKES MY HAND
LEADING ME
TO MY GRAVE IN THE NO MAN'S LAND

I'M DANCING, I'M CRYING
I'M LAUGHING, I'M DYING
I'M CELEBRATING THE END
AT MY GRAVE IN THE NO MAN'S LAND

THE FERRYMAN UNLEASH THE BEAST
I'VE PAID MY ONE WAY FARE
I LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE HOLY PRIEST
MY SCREAMS DISTURBING THE AIR
HE TURNS AROUND AND TAKES MY HAND
LEADING ME
TO MY GRAVE IN THE NO MAN'S LAND
