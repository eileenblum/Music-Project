Far away from the rising sun
I saw a shadow following me
Water glimmering before my eyes
But it's only the devil in disguise

I feel a hand caressing my head
I'm bonded by the fear of death
I'm getting up with my last power
In mortal agony I breath

OUT OF THE LIGHT SHE'S COMING UP
SERVING ME THE GOLDEN CUP
SHE'S SAVING MY SOUL AND GETTING CLOSE
I SEE THE EYES OF MY DESERT ROSE

A golden fortress in the middle of nowhere
Birds fly high through the desert sun
She's leading me behind the curtain
Where eagles dare and life has begun

OUT OF THE LIGHT SHE'S COMING UP
SERVING ME THE GOLDEN CUP
SHE'S SAVING MY SOUL AND GETTING CLOSE
I SEE THE EYES OF MY DESERT ROSE

I'm waking up out of this dream
Wishing well it would become true
I remember well what she has told
Now I'm prepared for becoming old

OUT OF THE LIGHT SHE'S COMING UP
SERVING ME THE GOLDEN CUP
SHE'S SAVING MY SOUL AND GETTING CLOSE
I SEE THE EYES OF MY DESERT ROSE
