Running down the street
The monkey on my back
Night becomes true
Blood runs red
Monkeys hunting me
My heart runs faster
My breath comes hap
Until I hold

Hell know
The good will to buy
Hell knows
The bad shall die

Jeepers creepers on the hut tonight
Jeepers creepers afraid of the light
Jeepers creepers suck with the devil
Jeepers creepers gonna kill the rebel

I feel the beat of my heart stand still
I shake my hand I feel too real
The monkey spitting to my neck
Laughing brain is full of crack
Lord please rescue me
Take my crowd of thumbs
Deliver me from evil
Remade my brain and end

Hell know
The good will to buy
Hell knows
The bad shall die

Jeepers creepers on the hut tonight
Jeepers creepers afraid of the light
Jeepers creepers suck with the devil
Jeepers creepers gonna kill the rebel

Jeepers creepers on the hut tonight
Jeepers creepers afraid of the light
Jeepers creepers suck with the devil
Jeepers creepers gonna kill the rebel

Jeepers creepers gonna kill
Jeepers creepers
Jeepers creepers gonna kill
Jeepers creepers gonna kill the rebel
