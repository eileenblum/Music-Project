I look around and see their faces
I feel the hate and deadly embraces
They're screaming and laughing
I hear their obcsenities
They're crying and joking

HEAVEN IS OPEN
THE JOURNEY BEGINS
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
TEARS AT MY SKIN
HEAVEN IS OPEN
NOW IT'S MY LOSS
THE KING WILL DIE
AT THE DIVIDED CROSS

My father called me and now I'm free
When he showed me the way I can't disagree
They're screaming and laughing
Blood runs down my crown
They're crying and joking

HEAVEN IS OPEN
THE JOURNEY BEGINS
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
TEARS AT MY SKIN
HEAVEN IS OPEN
NOW IT'S MY LOSS
THE KING WILL DIE
AT THE DIVIDED CROSS

HEAVEN IS OPEN
THE JOURNEY BEGINS
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
TEARS AT MY SKIN
HEAVEN IS OPEN
NOW IT'S MY LOSS
THE KING WILL DIE
AT THE DIVIDED CROSS
