I am just a fearless hero
I still haven't learned to fear
I am the almighty hero
Death calls me a fearless being

The dead can tell no tales
When my sword never lies
I'll discover the treasure
The hoard in the game

Will I possess the holy ring
Become the ruler or the king
Or will I fight its keeper
The bringer of torture and pain

I am just a fearless hero
I still haven't learned to fear
I am the almighty hero
Death calls me a fearless being

Fire speeds through every vein
I have no brothers
Have no sisters
My mother was dead
My father was slain
I never saw them in my life

I was forced to slay the dragon
Forced to kill the wicked one
How can I break through this place
[?And wake the rightful me no more?]

I am just a fearless hero
I still haven't learned to fear
I am the almighty hero
Death calls me a fearless being

Hero, hero, hero.
Hero, hero, hero.
Hero, hero, hero.
Hero, hero, hero.
Hero, hero, hero.
Hero, hero, hero.
