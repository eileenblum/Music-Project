Forever you'll smile
Forever you'll breath
Forever you'll live in my heart

If I could rise...
If I could fly...
I would catch the stars from the sky...

Goodbye my love,
Goodbye my life,
Goodbye my sweet romance,
Forever you'll be mine,
You'll be mine...

You are my soul,
You are my light,
I'll need you somewhere out in the night...

I feel you in me,
I feel you in here,
You whispering words in my ear

Goodbye my love,
Goodbye my life,
Goodbye my sweet romance,
Forever you'll be mine,
You'll be mine...
