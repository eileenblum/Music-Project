Night is falling
Brothers in blood
Invincible in their faith

Deceiver, believer,
Stronger than steel
Insanity is what I feel

Here I stand
Take my hand
Let us flee
To be free

I'm a liar
I'm a sinner
I feel pain
Running through my veins

I'm a liar
I'm a sinner
I feel pain
Of my own destiny

Fighting, dying,
Revenge in blood
Listen to the tongues of hate

Destroyer, betrayer,
Witness of love
Sadness is my lonley fate

Here I stand
Take my hand
Let us flee
To be free

I'm a liar
I'm a sinner
I feel pain
Running through my veins

I'm a liar
I'm a sinner
I feel pain
Of my own destiny
