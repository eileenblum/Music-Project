Father tell me, what's troubling you
How your worries upset your child
I saw his eyes, heard his words
I realized the hero's solemn distress

Confide in me, I'm loyal to you
But I can't kill, your son, your blood

Killing, fighting for victory
Killing, fighting the enemy
Killing, fighting in agony
Killing, dying for glory

Maidens of war
Children of the gods
Farewell - farewell
Maidens of war

You slaughter, you've killed your flesh
Why you deny, the love with pain and death
Your spear destroyed the glorious sword
Broke into nameless steel forever

Killing, fighting for victory
Killing, fighting the enemy
Killing, fighting in agony
Killing, dying for glory

Maidens of war
Children of the gods
Farewell - farewell
Maidens of war

Why, why, why commit the cruel murder
Why, why, why I 'm imprisoned by the holy fire

Maidens of war
Children of the gods
Farewell - farewell
Maidens of war
