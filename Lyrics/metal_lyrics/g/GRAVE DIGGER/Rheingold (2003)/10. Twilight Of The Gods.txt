Stack stout logs for me in pile
By the shore of the Rhine
High and bright let a fire blaze
For the noble hero
With his sword he shall burn
The horse by his side
So cast your eyes on my pain and grief
Behold your eternal guilt

Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods

Feel my hatred, mighty gods
My screams break the silent air
I 'll take your gold, give it away
To free my self from the magic curse
You will burn deep in hell
For the murder of my love
Darkness near, the Rhine overflows,
Higher and higher, waves grow

Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods

Bright flames set fire to the hall
Valhalla's end is near
Gods and heroes are lost in the hall
See Valhalla's fall

Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods
Twilight of the gods
