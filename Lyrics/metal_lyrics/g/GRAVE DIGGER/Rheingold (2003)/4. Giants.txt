Sacred hall, eternal might
Endless fame, see the golden light
Son of the dark, Godess of youth,
Sacrifice her, and pay the price

Forever you'll be guilty
Forever you'll be free
Forever you'll be strong
Forever you will live in peace

But in the light of day, pay us penance
Instead of the godess, we'll have the ring
Brother take heed, don't be greedy
The gold, the treasure, is mine forever

I have slain my brother
Cause we hate each other
I have changed my face
To the dragon's race
