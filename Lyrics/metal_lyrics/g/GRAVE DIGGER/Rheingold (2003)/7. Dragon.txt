A savage dragon in the dark cavern mouth
A rancid below pours from it
If you are spatterd with his venomous poison
Beware and protect from his swishing tail

Kill kill the dragon
Kill kill - the beast inside
Kill kill the dragon
Victory is by my side

He thrust the sword into the dragon's guts
Pierced his heart and shut his mouth
He tasted the blood and listened to the birds
Who told him about the liars words

Kill kill the dragon
Kill kill - the beast inside
Kill kill the dragon
Victory is by my side
