All the time friends of mine
Compliment me
All day long nothing's wrong
Just to please me
What the Hell, let them say
They above me
A two-faced lie can't be true
It all bores me
Friends of mine say I'm fine -
Don't believe them
Friend's of mine, they don't know
My suspicion
Push on in, stand up close
While I'm winning
Get a share, an empty stare -
Thanks, I'm leavin'
Friends of mine
Rule the world
Friends of mine
Ruin the world
But it's true, I don't know
Who's beside me
I look around, see my friends
Do they see me
I can't count on one or two
When I'm lovely
But the rest, their interest:
Big time money
Friends of mine
Take good care
Friends of mine
Better watch out
Watch yourselves
Friends of mine, I don't know
Who's beside me
I look around, see my friends
Do they see me
I can't count on one or two
When I'm lovely
But the rest, their interest:
Big time money
