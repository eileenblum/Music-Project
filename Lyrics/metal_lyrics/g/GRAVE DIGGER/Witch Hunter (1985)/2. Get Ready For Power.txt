There are right for your show
We will show you the way to go
Why don't you stay with us tonight
You soon will see that we are right
You're such lovely people
Shovin' 'round the floor
If you have to fight
Step outside the door
We say hello, good evening one and all
We are so glad to see you in this hall
We're gonna play you all your favorite songs
And we all hope you're gonna sing along
Rock'n'Roll, the time is right
Get ready for power
And if you like to, please pour another glass
It's up to you now to do what we have asked
There's nothing else that you will have to do
On with the show, we wish good health to you
Yes, that's power baby - ain't great
Roll'em over, baby - tell it straight
Show's on baby - one more cry
Why, why, why don't we try
