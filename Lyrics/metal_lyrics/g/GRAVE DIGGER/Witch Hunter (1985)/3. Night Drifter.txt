Well, it's a game
It's allright, let me stay
Until sunrise
I'm out all night long
What could ever call me home
Before daylight
On and on I go
That's the way I wanna live
You're got what you want
Mix another drink
In this state I can't go on
Time's runnin' on
I want some more
More and more and more
It's to late for me to go
Just one more night
I wanna stay
And take my word
It's no luck to be alone
Why do I have to live this way
Night drifter
Cries in his pillow
Night drifter
Cries in his pillow
