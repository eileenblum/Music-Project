Let's try reaching for the
sky
Hang on and you're gonna die
Our lives can turn so sweet
Child with an innocent smile
Destroys me all the while
Don't be fooled when he
cries
You sit there watching all
go down
Live your life to a
different sound
You fought for freedom,
you're fighting still
You'll never get fortune,
pay your bill

[Chorus:]
More lies, more promises
We all live in a world of
fools
More lies, more promises
We all live in a world of
fools
In a world of fools

Nobody vomes to show you a
line
Open your eyes and find the
sign
And now you're awventy, to
old to die
More and more you accept
that's all a lie
