Hell is covered with sludge and blood
Insanity will kill the last man standing
Now we are back in times of hate
Ignorance will kill the last in line

Wheels keep on turning
They never will stand still

In - into into the war
In - into into the war
In - into into the war
In - into into the war

Men fight men fight day by day
Mankind will die by the hand of mankind
New weapons from hell, will take your last breath
Millions will cross the borderlines of death
