Scream and die - at the gallows pole
Where the hanged are singing songs of despair
Hope is the last what they have in mind
Songs of revolution are hanging in the air

The master of death, deep in their mind
Stealing their lives and leaving them blind
No mercy, no excuse for all of your sins
You will die in agony, the evil within

Run and hide
As long as you can
The race is started
Let the hangman begin

Kill you - at the gallows pole
Where the brave find their rest and pray for the dead
Ballads are sung and the earth starts to quake
The last supper starts for the slaughter you wait

Run and hide
As long as you can
The race is started
Let the hangman begin
