Undead rise from their graves to the sky
Hell Dogs howl, and on the fields the survivors cry

Undead call, the demons from hell
From the purgatory, where evil dwells

All Saints and sinners
The mask of hate
All Winners and Losers
Look at your fate

A cry without tears
A scream you can't hear
As skies turn to red
Feel the sorrow of the dead
Sorrow of the dead

The dead scream out loud, about the gods of war
Demons of doom, spitting out the gore
