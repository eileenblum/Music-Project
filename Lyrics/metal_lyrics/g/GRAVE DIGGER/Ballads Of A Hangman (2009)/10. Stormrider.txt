Heading for the north
Heading for the south
Burning the ground we leave behind
We are the scum of mankind

Eye to eye and
Face to face
We scream and shout
We shout out loud

Stormrider
The devil's at our side
Stormrider
Passion makes us wild
Stormrider
Killing is our style
Stormrider
We'll never die without a smile

One second to live
Two seconds to die
Procession of loudness
On steel wings we fly
No one can stop us
We are the law
We never, never, never withdraw
