[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak somewhere in this town
See me and the boys we don't like it so we're getting up and going down
Hiding low looking right to left if you see us coming I think it's best
To move away do you hear what I say from under my breath
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble some of us won't survive
See the boys and me mean business busting out dead or alive
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose alarm and sirens wail
Like the game if you lose go to jail
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak so don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna trouble I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak so woman stay with a friend
You know it's safer breakout breakout breakout breakout
Tonight there's gonna be a breakout into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us no one could for long
Searchlight on my trail tonight's the night all systems fail
Hey you good lookin' female come here
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak so don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna trouble I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak so woman stay with a friend
