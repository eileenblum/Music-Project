Voices in my head pray for a dream
Pain and agony make me scream
The night and the gods call out my name
No echoes no shadows it's a useless game

I'm not the first and I won't be the last
I am your son you're my devil of the past
The nightmare is you - I am convicted
To step into the
Grave of the addicted

I'm pressing my head deep in the dust
Licking the sand with incredible lust
I take a rest under the old tree
A friend that laughs and speaks to me
