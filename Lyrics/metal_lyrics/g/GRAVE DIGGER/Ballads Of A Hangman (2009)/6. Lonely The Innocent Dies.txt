Please take my hand I'm scared of the night
Show me the way back to the light
I'm so afraid I could lose your love
And if you were gone I'd cry like the mourning dove

I brought you flowers black like the night
One for the evening one for the night
But you couldn't say no to the hand of the priest
A liar, betrayer, smiling with the face of a beast

Lonely the innocence dies
No name on their gravestone no cloud in the sky
Without memories the raven will fly
Without love the innocence dies

My hands will not touch you, but they'll bring you pain
I'm feeling so empty, alone in the rain
Can it be a fault, can it be a crime
I take you back home, make you a part of mine

Touch me I'm so cold, I'm pale and grey
My eyes are blood-red, love fades away
I cry and I scream - no words from my mouth
My soul crosses the land, and finds rest in the south
Into the war
