My demons watch out to find a sacrifice
The wind blows straight into my face
Sweating hands cover the knife
I try to hide my thrill of the chase

Death could be the end
If pain is your friend
Morning will come
Bad days are gone

I'm out of control
I'm out on patrole
I'm the shadow
The shadow of your soul

Loneliness will guide you through the night
When you hear my whisper at your side
Sleep sweet lullaby it could be your last
Jack's my name - I'm the ghost of the past

When you wake up, I will be there
Ripping your body, touching your hair
A permanent nightmare that's what I am
I shear your skin like an innocent lamb
