I'm sitting in my chamber staring at the floor
Hammering my head against the wall
I'm screaming at the mirror scrawling signs into the air
Tears running down my face I'm feeling so scared

Watch me cry
Ask me why
Watch me die
My life is such a lie

Hell, hell
Hell of disillusion
Die, die
Hell of disillusion

My hands are full of blood, the mirror lies broken
What have I done, my guilt is unspoken
My mind stays alone, my fate turns to hate
Lifeless eyes, about a life I did take
