Night after night she would knock on my door
Like a cockroach she crawled on the bloodstained floor
Begging for money for one last glass of wine
Selling her soul she would never resign

Dancing like mad in the darkness of the night
Beauty has fallen far out of her sight

Say farewell to a fallen angel
Funeral for a useless soul
Say farewell to the life I've taken
Funeral for a heart that's forsaken

An immaculate goddess rides on the wings of a devil
The procession moves on and they whisper of murder
Flowers are thrown on the crate of the brave
Tears are falling down from heaven on her grave

Dancing like mad till the rising of light
Dogs howl in the distance as she dresses in white

Funeral for a fallen angel
Funeral for a useless soul
Funeral for the life I've taken
Funeral for a heart that's forsaken
