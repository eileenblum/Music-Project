[Bonus Track]Pledge loyalty to the crown
He should not rest nor back down
Royal blood and noble heart
His aim in life is the Quest
Hidden castle in the west
Watched by maidens young and pure
Temptation meets Desire
Getting burned by the fire
Wait until the time is ripe

Parcival
True knight of the grail
Parcival
Come your time and you can't fail

There is still a long way
To be worthy of the Grail
Before reaching the aim
He will have the treasure
When he can resign to pleasure
So he follows his path
At the risk of his life
Dream away and see the sign
Keeper of the castle's Grail
