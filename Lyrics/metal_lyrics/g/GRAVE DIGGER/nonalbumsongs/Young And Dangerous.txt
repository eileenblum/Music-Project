[2015 Exhumation (The Early Years) Compilation]It's twelve o'clock and creatures rise
From their cradles to the grave
A mystic tune from far beyond
Calling the restless and the brave

Out of their graves, they scream for mercy
Seven deadly sins were written down
The night is filled with hopes and prayers
Thousand eyes stare into the night

Keep your flags high in the sky
Praise the metal gods
Raise your fists, shout the battle cry
Fighting against all odds

We're young, young and dangerous
We're old, wilder than the rest
We're stainless steel and contagious
We're the world, we are obsessed

We're young, young and dangerous
We're old, wilder than the rest
We're stainless steel and contagious
We're the world, we are possessed

Thunder and lightning on the horizon
Armies of the night are on the prowl
Gathering for a new world order
Born and die with hearts of steel
