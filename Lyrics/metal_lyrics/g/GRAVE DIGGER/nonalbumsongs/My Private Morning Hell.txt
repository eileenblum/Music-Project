[2015 Exhumation (The Early Years) Compilation]The sun rises up, I feel so bad
The beast in my head, drives me mad
No one told me before, about this ugly whore
Lying beside me, god let it be

I tried to remember, what was the night before
After a lot of beers, I crashed the dance floor
Hanging around, spent a lot of money
The band was in town, drinking vodka with honey

Welcome to my private morning hell
Welcome to my private morning hell

I jumped out of the window, and started to run
The bitch behind me, follows me with a gun
No one can help, she is out of control
I'm facing the end, and losing my soul

Welcome to my private morning hell
Welcome to my private morning hell

[Solo]

Welcome to my private morning hell
Welcome to my private morning hell
Welcome to my private morning hell
Welcome to my private morning hell
