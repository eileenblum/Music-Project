In my darkest hours I see your face
I fell with the gods in deadly disgrace
My heart screams vengeance during the fight
I find my fortune in the dark of the night

God of the wind
Calling me home
God of the sea
Let me be free

And if I die, I die, i die in dignity
The almighty gods are my destiny
And if I take revenge, no one shall remain
After my revenge, they will die in pain
They'll die in pain

With my blood I write my name in the sand
And I swear they all will die by my hand
Minions of trust, for them I only feel hate
I will kill to fulfill my fate

God of the wind
Calling me home
God of the sea
Let me be free

And if I die, I die, i die in dignity
The almighty gods are my destiny
And if I take revenge, no one shall remain
After my revenge, they will die in pain
They'll die in pain
