Between heaven and hell and day and night
There's a place on a mountain above the sky
Gods of fire, of death and war
Breaking the silence, can't you hear them roar

The World will twist around
And we all must die
And the World is falling down
Under a blood red sky

Clash of the Gods

Beggars and saints, wasted and wounded
Innocent victims crying at the moon
The earth is getting colder and darker
The sun is whistling a dying tune

The World will twist around
And we all must die
And the World is falling down
Under a blood red sky

Clash of the Gods
