Time has come, my journey's at the end
Years I have traveled, lost a lot of friends
At the walls of Troy I fought for my king
Achilles by my side for the faith to win

Saints and sinners
Liars and killers
Gods and heroes
Crossed my ways

Home at last
Goodbye to the past
Home at last
Our faith is hard and fast
Home at last
Tied to the mast
Home at last, Home at last!

The end of the day brought us the victory
We paid for our sins with pain and misery

Saints and sinners
Liars and killers
Gods and heroes
Crossed my ways

Home at last
Goodbye to the past
Home at last
Our faith is hard and fast
Home at last
Tied to the mast
Home at last, Home at last!
