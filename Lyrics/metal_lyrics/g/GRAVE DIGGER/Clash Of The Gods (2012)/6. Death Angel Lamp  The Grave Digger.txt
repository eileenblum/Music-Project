Side by side at the open grave
She took my hand and danced with me
Everything you can think of this is true
On the razors edge, I'm dancing to you

All of my dreams are lost and found
My whole life is nailed to the ground
I paid the price for a game I couldn't win
Blood and thunder... That is my sin

One last kiss
Take me home
Spread your wings
Where I'll be king

Voices of disaster, rain that never ends
Now and forever in passionate flames
At the end of the day, please pull the trigger
Two souls collide, Death Angel and the Grave Digger

A thousand times I've stood on a sheer
To find my freedom, a life without fear
Save me, rape me, feed me with misery
On wings of hope, I run from reality

A bucket full of dimes has been never enough
To leave the bad side, getting out of the slough
I spit on the bullet, I'm dead now for hours
Please put on my grave the dreamland flowers

One last kiss
Take me home
Spread your wings
Where I'll be king

Voices of disaster, rain that never ends
Now and forever in passionate flames
At the end of the day, please pull the trigger
Two souls collide, Death Angel and the Grave Digger
