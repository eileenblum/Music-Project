The end of the war, a giant wooden hollow horse
Sacred by gods, filled with soldiers and a driving force
People of Troy ignored this terrible warning
A self-fulfilling prophecy, surrounded by great secrecy

Living in a bad dream
Misfortune never seen
By the sun, the curse and spell
I have found my own hell

At the walls of sorrow
Clouds are changing into black
There will be no tomorrow
No regrets, no turning back

At the walls of sorrow
Clouds are changing into black
We are lost in the morrow
No regrets, no turning back

At the end of the day we're standing in a river of blood
Swords up in the sky, boots deep in the deadly mud
Dividing the spoil, ships lying proud in the wind
Drenched is all the earth, we are leaving behind

Living in a bad dream
Misfortune never seen
By the sun, the curse and spell
I have found my own hell

At the walls of sorrow
Clouds are changing into black
There will be no tomorrow
No regrets, no turning back

At the walls of sorrow
Clouds are changing into black
We are lost in the morrow
No regrets, no turning back
