My journey began after the war of Troy
I lost many a friend, my faith and my joy
Trouble started as we dazzled the cyclops
We're punished with pain more than words can say

Only the blind can see
Only the deaf can hear
Only the dead can fell
The magic of our symphony
Only the blind will see
Only the deaf will hear
Only the dead will fell
On the island of serenity

It's the call of the sirens
It's the call of the dead
It's the call of the sirens
It's the call of the dead

Winds were a gift - ensure a safe return
Fools set winds loose, hearts began to burn
Our ship drifted off far away from my home
My journey starts again, my heart cries despair
