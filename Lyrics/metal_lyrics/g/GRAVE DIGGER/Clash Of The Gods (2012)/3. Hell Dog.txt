He's sitting there with bleeding teeth
A poor lost soul on his knees
He's howling and laughing and biting around
He's rolling his eyes and roaring aloud

He's looking at liars, looking at me
There's no excape, no chance to flee
In front of him, we're all the same
Locked and imprisoned, that's his aim

Withoud fear, we will die
Without fear, we'll close our eyes

We knock at the door at the gates of hell
We greet the dead with a wishing well
Don't mess around, we are slaves of hate
Hell dog is here, death is our fate

We are standing there, no chance to deny
Madness and sadness, it's time to die
Lost and burned, no hope for tomorrow
Our life was full of pain and sorrow
