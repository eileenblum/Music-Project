Straight into the sun warrior of the eastern world
On the road to Babylon far away from Avalon
Walls canÂ´t stop me IÂ´m on the prowl
Brought a couple to death
Intoxicated by crystal meth

I am the killer the road rage killer
Hell on wheels the master of steel
I am the killer the road rage killer
Faster than light evil of the night road rage killer

DonÂ´t look around and never look back
Get your eyes straight ahead get ready for attack
Fear isnÂ´t my friend huh huh huh haa
A word IÂ´ve never heard
Rage is my passion death will be my end

I am the killer the road rage killer
Hell on wheels the master of steel
I am the killer the road rage killer
Faster than light evil of the night

I am the killer the road rage killer
Hell on wheels the master of steel
I am the killer the road rage killer
Faster than light evil of the night
I am the killer the road rage killer
Hell on wheels the master of steel
I am the killer the road rage killer
Faster than light evil of the night
