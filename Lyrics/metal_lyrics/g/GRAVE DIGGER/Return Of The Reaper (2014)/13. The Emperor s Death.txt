[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Silence is bitter words fade away
WeÂ´re dancing on waves high like a wall
Into the mystery of life
WeÂ´re leavinÂ´ the twilight hall
As slaves we were born as slaves we will die
In the dust of Rome dead bodies lie
Holy grounds we fight with our blood
Til the last name is written in the mud

The arms of twilight dandling my soul
The wind is whispering your name
In the hands of time my heart beats for you
Gloomy silence makes me cry

The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death

Out of the ruins of lies
WeÂ´re riding the sea like an arrow
Sadness is sweet truth in my eyes
We are leaving the kingdom of sorrow

The arms of twilight dandling my soul
The wind is whispering your name
In the hands of time my heart beats for you
Gloomy silence makes me cry

The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death

The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death hail hail
The emperorÂ´s death
