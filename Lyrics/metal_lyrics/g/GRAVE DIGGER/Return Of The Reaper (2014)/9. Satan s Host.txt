Watch me die at the cemetery
Killed by priests of evil mercenary
Hands are cold my face is pale
A warm embrace souls for sale

Heathen demon church and death
Kills my brain and steals my breath
Heathen demon holy ghost
Welcome SatanÂ´s host
Welcome SatanÂ´s host

Satan lord alive and mystified
All mankind will be victimized
Pray for mercy I am your whip
Obey my prayer suck my dick

Heathen demon church and death
Gives me hope and leaves me blessed
Heathen demon holy ghost
Welcome SatanÂ´s host
Welcome SatanÂ´s host

Welcome welcome
Heathen demon church and death
Kills my brain and steals my breath
Heathen demon holy ghost
Welcome SatanÂ´s host
Welcome SatanÂ´s host
Welcome SatanÂ´s host
