I wish I could be someone else
To live my dream to live my fears
I wish I could stop beating myself
To save my soul to share my tears
Take me back into your arms
Take away this crown of thorns
The highest summits I will rise
To fight my demon in disguise

Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe til the end of time will set me free
Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe true love will set me free

I close my eyes the sun goes down
I hold my breath and hear the sound
IÂ´m still alive and ready to leave
I see my life in endless grief

Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe til the end of time will set me free
Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe true love will set me free

Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe true love will set me free
Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe til the end of time will set me free
Nothing to believe something died inside of me
Nothing to believe true love will set me free
