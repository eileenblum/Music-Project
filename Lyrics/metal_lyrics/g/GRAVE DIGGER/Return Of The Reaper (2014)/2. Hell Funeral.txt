Ravens of death calling my name
Right out of hell with an evil spell
There is no romance only fire and screams
Darkness is rising and killing your dreams

Revelation has arrived in the fire you will die

The reaper is back with angels of black
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral
The reaperÂ´s not dead heÂ´s dead ahead
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral

Pounding sound get down to the ground
Into the blackness where silence is dead
Wafts of mist cover the land
See my coach and coffin be sure itÂ´s your end

Revelation has arrived in the fire you will die

The reaper is back with angels of black
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral
The reaperÂ´s not dead heÂ´s dead ahead
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral

The reaper has returned a lesson they should learn
From darkness he will rise he kills all the silent cries
Yes the reaper has returned all human life is burned
Anguish fear and pain welcome to reaperÂ´s reign

Revelation has arrived in the fire you will die

The reaper is back with angels of black
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral
The reaperÂ´s not dead heÂ´s dead ahead
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral
The reaper is back with angels of black
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral
The reaperÂ´s not dead heÂ´s dead ahead
HellÂ´s bells hell funeral
