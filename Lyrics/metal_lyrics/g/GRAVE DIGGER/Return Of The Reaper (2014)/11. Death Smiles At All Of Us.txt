Under the spell into the gates of hell
Sacrificed for mercy the price you have to pay
A storm comes up empty streets lonely rats
Cry for the children following the tunes of death

Laughing eyes will show no fear
IÂ´m out to kill revenge is near

Death smiles at all of us killing without mercy
Soul dies fearless eyes death smiles at all of us
Death smiles at all of us killing without mercy
Angel cries no more lies

Ashes to ashes hate is under your skin
Dust to dust the victims of your sin

Laughing eyes will show no fear
IÂ´m out to kill revenge is near

Death smiles at all of us killing without mercy
Soul dies fearless eyes death smiles at all of us
Death smiles at all of us killing without mercy
Angel cries no more lies

Laughing eyes will show no fear
IÂ´m out to kill revenge is near

Death smiles at all of us killing without mercy
Soul dies fearless eyes death smiles at all of us
Death smiles at all of us killing without mercy
Angel cries no more lies
