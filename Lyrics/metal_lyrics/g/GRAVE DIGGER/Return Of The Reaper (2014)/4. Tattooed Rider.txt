IÂ´m back on track I never look back
Two wheels will guide me straight to heaven
The road be my grave at the end of all days
My death tone sounds in a metal way

Harder and faster hear my laughter
By moonlight ride with God by my side

IÂ´m a tattooed rider straight out of hell
IÂ´m a law breaker thunder yells
IÂ´m a risk taker a trouble maker
Hunted like a spider tattooed rider rider

Live for the moment I live my dreams
I never surrender in moments of pain
Life gives me brighter days open your eyes
When heart and soul unite see the light in the sky

Harder and faster hear my laughter
By moonlight ride with God by my side

IÂ´m a tattooed rider straight out of hell
IÂ´m a law breaker thunder yells
IÂ´m a risk taker a trouble maker
Hunted like a spider tattooed rider rider

IÂ´m a tattooed rider straight out of hell
IÂ´m a law breaker thunder yells
IÂ´m a risk taker a trouble maker
Hunted like a spider tattooed rider rider rider
