Raging through fields of agony
Soldiers kill without morality
War is conducted highest brutality
Each lost life is a tragedy

Again and again turns the wheel of time
On and on until the last king dies

War God war God war God war God
Enemies will rise with swords of hate
War God war God war God war God
Hellbent for vengeance bloodshed for free

War leaves pain and punishment
Sparked by greedy governments
Sparing their lives in imprisonment
Or die by torture and ill intent

Return to hell demonÂ´s child
Get out of my way we are running wild

War God war God war God war God
Enemies will rise with swords of hate
War God war God war God war God
Hellbent for vengeance bloodshed for free

War God war God war God war God
War God war God war God war God

War God war God war God war God
Enemies will rise with swords of hate
War God war God war God war God
Hellbent for vengeance bloodshed for free
