A misty dawn breaks through the clounds
The forests sleeping horses rise.
The thunder God demands tribute
The king refused to pay the price
Princess of the midnight sun
Lost in the shadows on the run
To survive wolves on the hunt
The nightmare won't end
A wonder must come

Only the good will survive, only a few will find salvation
Hold up the flame to be alive, reaching out for revelation

Season of the witch

Father father i don't wanna die
Oh Lord, please tell me why

Father father you betrayed me
Oh Lord, why you broke me

Only the good will survive, only a few will find salvation
Hold up the flame to be alive, reaching out for revelation

Season of the witch, time to break out
Season of the witch, don't cry too loud
Season of the witch, time to break free
Season of the witch, join the crowd and follow me

Only the good will survive, only a few will find salvation
Hold up the flame to be alive, reaching out for revelation

Season of the witch [4x]
