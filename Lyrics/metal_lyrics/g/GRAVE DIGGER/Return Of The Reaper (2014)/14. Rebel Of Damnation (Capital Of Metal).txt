[Limited Edition Bonus Track]When I was sixteen I had a dream
To bring myself out and start to scream
I am the son of Judas seen like a priest
In my deepest soul lurks a beast
I laugh and defy I break the strain
My father a devil I had him slain
Steel in my heart IÂ´m lookinÂ´ for a fight
IÂ´m a human animal a wolf in the night

The pain the sorrow the song remains insane
The hate the horror rebellion in my veins

The capital of metal living a life an everyday battle
Raise your fist lost generation
Trust your fate rebel of damnation

God by my side but he wonÂ´t save me
In this world thereÂ´s no place to be
Now I realize my life was a lie
I believe in metal til the day I die

The pain the sorrow the song remains insane
The hate the horror rebellion in my veins

The capital of metal living a life an everyday battle
Raise your fist lost generation
Trust your fate rebel of damnation
The capital of metal living a life an everyday battle
Raise your fist lost generation
Trust your fate rebel of damnation
Rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel of damnation

The capital of metal living a life an everyday battle
Raise your fist lost generation
Trust your fate rebel of damnation
The capital of metal living a life an everyday battle
Raise your fist lost generation
Trust your fate rebel rebel rebel rebel
