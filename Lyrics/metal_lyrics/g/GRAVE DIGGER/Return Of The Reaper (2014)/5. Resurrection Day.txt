Shadows from a wasted land
Human rights facing end
Wind carries on a nasty smell
Evils breed ride straight out of hell

No time to lose silence means the end
No other choice silence is my friend

Resurrection day
From ashes theyÂ´ll rise hell to pay
Resurrection day
From down below beggars pray

Stars fall down from the skies
Far away I hear the battle cries
The flag of hate blowing up in the wind
The misery of society forgives our sins

No time to lose silence means the end
No other choice silence is my friend

Resurrection day
From ashes theyÂ´ll rise hell to pay
Resurrection day
From down below beggars pray

Resurrection day
From ashes theyÂ´ll rise hell to pay
Resurrection day
From down below beggars pray
Resurrection day
From ashes theyÂ´ll rise hell to pay
Resurrection day
From down below beggars pray
