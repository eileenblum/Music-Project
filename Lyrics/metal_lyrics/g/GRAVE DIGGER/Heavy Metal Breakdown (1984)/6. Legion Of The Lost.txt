The gates of hell are open
The night of the wolf is broken
The signs of madness are shining
The sun of devil is rising

They're marchng through the night
They're searching for bread
They're infected with plague
They're infected with death
They know they have to die
And the end is a grave
They shout into the dark
It's a cry in the night

Marching for freedom, marching for life
Searching for love
But they don't wanna die
Don't walk to heaven, don't walk to hell
There's no escape for the legion
Of the lost, legion of the lost
Legion of the lost, legion of the lost

They're marching on and on
There's no place to hide
They're living in fear, oh god can't you see
Their eyes are full of tears, they've started to run
Now they reach the end, the end of the way

Marching for freedom marching for life...
The lifion of the lost
