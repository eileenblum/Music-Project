Metal invasion that's all what we need
Metal dominion that's all what we want
We come to give you rules and principles
What you have to do
We come to shake your hands and legs
As fast as we can do

Heavy Metal Breakdown

Women and children want to hear the noise
Women and children want to feel the beat
Bang your heads as fast as you can
Until you're breaking down
The night is long, the show is right
Bang until you die

Heavey Metal Breakdown
Shake your legs and bang your heads
Heavey Metal Breakdown
