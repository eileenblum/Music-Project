Rats are creeping under my skin
Come see the last place that I'm leaving in
The bitch in London stole the crown from me
I'm the heiress to the throne I want to break free

Death comes closer
Execution is near
My hands are empty
As I'm standing here

My blood will live forever
Believe in me now or never
On the wings of death I will fly
With pride for my people I will die

I've trusted in vain I've failed and lost
And now I'm here to pay the costs
The church turns away I'm standing alone
A small crowd believes that on the throne I belong
