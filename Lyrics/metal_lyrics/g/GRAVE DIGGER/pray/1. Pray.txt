I see myself lying on the bed
My head on the angels fold
An eagle waiting in the corner
To take away -- me and my soul
A journey without return
To a land that no one knows
My Avalon my paradise
Where angels dare my soul will rise

Pray - dancing through the night
Pray - until the morning light
Pray - pray for the devil's rite
Pray - because we'll die tonight

I wake up in the hell of Eden
Guardians taking care of me
Out of the haze a shadow moves
A unicorn black and wild
I open my eyes and look around
My hunger is fed by a lonesome child
It looks like me when I was young
I'm buried alive my life is done
