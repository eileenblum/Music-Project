My fingers touch the solid stones
Strong and cold, they keep me from home
Imprisoned like a wingless dove
Far away from the land I love

Lonely days count lonely years
I have cried a thousand tears
All that I tried to gain
Is lost the effort was in vane

At Carberry hill I lost my crown
My husband fled my luck went down
In England's hands I fell
18 years a living hell

The Scottish crown belongs to me
Yet I'm bound I can not flee
With iron claws England holds tight
All is lost no chance to fight

Silence - Silence Everywhere

[Chorus:]
Cold walls are my reward
Loneliness engulfs my soul
I've been true i gave my heart
Stained tears i cried
I long to be free again
To walk in peace again
Scotland cries her queen is lost
Agony's her friend again
