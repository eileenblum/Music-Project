Chosen as one free people from oppression
He lived a life in the name of god
Leading them out of slavery and depression
Gave the hopeless a sign to live, to live

With Egypt behind in front the ocean
Screaming for vengeance, murder and rape
Dividing the water with hands in motion
Opened the way for their escape

Waves will break the ocean of blood
Freedom waits behind
Waves will break the ocean of blood
Freedom belongs to all mankind

With fearless eyes they move
Through the curtain
Feeling the hate of the enemies behind
A sign will close the door for certain
Killing the hunter death they'll find
They'll find

Waves will break the ocean of blood
Freedom waits behind
Waves will break the ocean of blood
Freedom belongs to all mankind
