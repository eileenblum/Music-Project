Brothers in arms, see the red flag
Blow for you boldly in front at the stack
Around the banner join our troops
The weapons are sharpened waiting for attack

Watch out the morning red, upon the hill
(Enemies) they're out to kill
Forward the password, it's freedoms breath
The key to independence, liberty of death,
liberty of death

If the first has died, prepare for the act,
from the blood of our dead heroes,
breeds a new pact,
never surrender, never give up the faith
there's only one answer - liberty of death

Watch out the morning red, upon the hill
(Enemies) they're out to kill
Forward the password, it's freedoms breath
The key to independence, liberty of death,
liberty of death

From the ashes of our bones
Flames blazing high
Illuminate the enemy, blood red in the sky

Watch out the morning red, upon the hill
(Enemies) they're out to kill
Forward the password, it's freedoms breath
The key to independence, liberty of death,
liberty of death
