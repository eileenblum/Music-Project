Screams echoes from the hills
Bagpipes of war, crushing through the night
Fights going on for years
We never give up our rights to live
We are the last, fighting against a past
To be free.

Highland tears
In blood we died
The king is dead all soldiers cried
Highland tears
Flow through our veins
The English killed put us in chains

It is in truth not for glory, not riches,
Not honours that we are fighting for,
But for freedom
For that alone, which no honest man
gives up but with life itself
We are the last fighting against a past
To be free.

Highland tears
In blood we died
The king is dead all soldiers cried
Highland tears
Flow through our veins
The English killed put us in chains

Soldiers, mountains, marshy ground
In freedom we trust, death we found
Bows and spears serve for the barricades
We're fighting for tomorrow, a better decade

Highland tears
In blood we died
The king is dead all soldiers cried
Highland tears
Flow through our veins
The English killed put us in chains
