[Bonus Track for Japan]

Out of the light into the black
He's the king of Black Jack
Out of the Grave into the life
He's the king of dancing the jive
Wild and dangerous he's coming this way
Smiling and laughing it's reaper's day
Skulls and bones adorning the streets
Jumping around to the reaper's beats

That's the way of rock
That's the way of selling your soul
Move your bones, there's no chance
Move your corpse to the reaper's dance

Out of the light into the black
The reaper's dancing through the night
Like a howling wolf he's on the prowl
Stepping the metal, doing the growl
Wild and dangerous he's coming this way
Smiling and laughing it's reaper's day
Skulls and bones adorning the streets
Jumping around to the reaper's beats

That's the way of rock
That's the way of selling your soul
Move your bones, there's no chance
Move your corpse to the reaper's dance
