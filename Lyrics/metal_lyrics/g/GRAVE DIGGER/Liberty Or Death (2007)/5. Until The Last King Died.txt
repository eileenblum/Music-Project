Want you die for liberty
Fighting against poverty
Now our time has come
We'll fight with pride
Until the last king died
Until the last king died
Until the last king died

People living in poverty
Forced to live without a dime
Kings courts spreads the public funds
A life full of comfort and greed
Trust is broken, revolution's in the air
The king has nothing to declare...

Heads will roll - heads will fall
Hang them higher - hang them all

Want you die for liberty
Fighting against poverty
Now our time has come
We'll fight with pride
Until the last king died
Until the last king died

It's time for the people to take the crown
Nothing can stop them or bring them down
After the storm on the prison called Bastille
The nobles flew or were killed
People rises against martyrdom
Giving hearts, souls and lives for freedom

Heads will roll - heads will fall
Hang them higher - hang them all

Want you die for liberty
Fighting against poverty
Now our time has come
We'll fight with pride
Until the last king died
