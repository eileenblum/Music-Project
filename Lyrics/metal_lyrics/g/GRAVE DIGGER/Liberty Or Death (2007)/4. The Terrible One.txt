Born into a world of terror
Born into a reign of fear
Of fear and death, fear and death

Born into a world of fools
Born into a reign - without rules

Hate
I'm the law, I'm the war
Don't hide don't run
You can trust me I'm the terrible one

Lost his father, lost his trust,
Looked away in sad disgust

His mother was killed,
Through a poison affair
At the age of thirteen he
Smelled blood in the air
Young Ivan gathered for the crown
To be king of the kings
And bring the people down

Hate - pain

I'm the law, I'm the war
Don't hide don't run
You can trust me I'm the terrible one
