I'm the old man of the mountains leader of
Muslim warriors
I hand them the revelating pipe
Then they know the after-life

Wherever I order suicide
You will sacrifice
Jump, jump off the wall
Allah will receive you all

Fanatic assassins
Fanatic assassins

You are my war machines
Your minds painted blood-red
I'll wash your souls so white
Invincible in any fight
