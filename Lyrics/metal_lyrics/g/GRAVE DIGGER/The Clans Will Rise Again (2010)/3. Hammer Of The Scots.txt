Do you remember, the first son and king
Longshanks we call him, death he will bring
As we see him coming we running for our lives
At the end of the day we pay for their lies

Listen my friend his name carved in stone
My skin burned the sun, no fear we show

Raise your swords high Hammer of the Scots
We're like thunder from the sky
Hammer of the Scots hold your flags high
Hammer of the Scots we are born to die

He overcomes our land, steals our dream
Of freedom and peace, he invites us to scream
For all the dead corpses, he leaves behind
A killing machine, with anger in mind

Watch out my friend see the flag of hate
Run for your life it's your final fate

Raise your swords high Hammer of the Scots
We're like thunder from the sky
Hammer of the Scots hold your flags high
Hammer of the Scots we are born to die
