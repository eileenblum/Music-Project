Every night my heart starts to bleed
When I think about the deepest love I've ever had
Every night I lay down the creed - to kill
My heart and soul are so sad

I will follow you wherever you go
Till moon and stars where wild roses grow
On wings of sorrow we cross the sky
Till we find eachother where souls fly high

When rain turns to blood
I feel sadness inside
I feel the flame that burns in my heart
When rain turns to blood
I cry out your name
On one cold day that tears us apart
When rain turns to blood

Every night I reach for your hand in the rain
When I think about you love of my soul
Every night I feel the evil brings me pain
Haunting nightmares took me under control

I will follow you wherever you go
Till moon and stars where wild roses grow
On wings of sorrow we cross the sky
Till we find eachother where souls fly high

When rain turns to blood
I feel sadness inside
I feel the flame that burns in my heart
When rain turns to blood
I cry out your name
On one cold day that tears us apart
When rain turns to blood
