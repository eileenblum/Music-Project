[bonus track]

The pipes are calling and roses start falling
From town to town and down the mountain side
Follow the sight and find the place where IÂ´m lying
The winter has come I have to bite

The grave diggers guide me
Through the shattered dreams
The ravens start crying
Without any screams

I rest in peace til you come to me
Please touch my soul my heart will be free
Deep in the grave I hear voices above me
Watch me die under the black cherry tree

I follow my coffin my bones become dust
My glen sings the dutch for a life full of trust
The kiss of death concludes all my sorrow
Procession moves on and thereÂ´s no tomorrow

The grave diggers guide me
Through the shattered dreams
The ravens start crying
Without any screams

I rest in peace til you come to me
Please touch my soul my heart will be free
Deep in the grave I hear voices above me
Watch me die under the black cherry tree

The grave diggers guide me
Through the shattered dreams
The ravens start crying
Without any screams

I rest in peace til you come to me
Please touch my soul my heart will be free
Deep in the grave I hear voices above me
Watch me die under the black black cherry tree
