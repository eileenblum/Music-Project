Over the mountains and far away
Our women and children wait and pray
Where the grass is so green and water so clear
They are living in harmony and without fear

One day they came out of the dark
We were on a hunt and the dogs they barked
They murdered our families and tore us apart
As we saw them bleeding we lost our hearts

The clans will rise again. Rise
We reign with steel and pain

Tortured minds, our souls are screaming
From the woods the wolves are howling
We ride on the ground of our beloved land
In rage and anger we walk hand in hand

We fall in front spinning our plails
We kill like insane and we never fail
We yelling the war cry of the clan McLeod
The enemies run and we shout out proud

The clans will rise again. Rise
We reign with steel and pain
The clans will rise again. Rise
Revenge in our veins
