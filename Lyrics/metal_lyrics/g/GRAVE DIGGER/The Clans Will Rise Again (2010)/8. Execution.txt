With power and glory I fought
In one silent moment I was caught
In my prison I sit with pride
I wait for my last lonely ride

Nobles betrayed me behind my back
Now I hang here on my neck
The crowd observes my pain with desire
In the middle of the mob I see this liar

From church and kings I was betrayed
Eye to eye with hagmans blade
Gods and demons belong to me
I fight til my heart will be free

Execution - execution
My last words are revolution
Execution - execution
We never denied our evolution

Guilty they called me, strangled by hanging
Released the cord, as I was still alive
Eviscerated and beheaded
Haunting minutes before I've to die

From church and king I was betrayed
Eye to eye with hagmans blade
Gods and demons belong to me
I fight til my heart will be free

Execution - execution
My last words are revolution
Execution - execution
We never denied our evolution
Execution - execution
My last words are revolution
Execution - execution
We heading out for retribution
