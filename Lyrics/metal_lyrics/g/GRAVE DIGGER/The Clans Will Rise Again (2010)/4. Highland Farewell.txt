A nameless day in the mist
There is no right to exist
Silent screams are calling for vengeance
Wind is blowing through my wounded heart

Leaving my life behind
Leaving my hope
Searching the peace of mind

Can't you hear it. Can't you see
Magic islands, haunted hills
Where I live and dwell
Wherever I may wander, wherever I rove
My sunset and my dawn
Highland farewell

Blood soaked snow on my soul
Deeper I fall into this wide black hole
My demons guide me to my inner depth
Where I lay down myself to death

Leaving my life behind
Leaving my hope
Searching the peace of mind

Can't you hear it. Can't you see
Magic islands, haunted hills
Where I live and dwell
Wherever I may wander, wherever I rove
My sunset and my dawn
Highland farewell
