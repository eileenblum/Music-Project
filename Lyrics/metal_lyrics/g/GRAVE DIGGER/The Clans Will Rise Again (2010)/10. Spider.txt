Six battles I've lost in the fields of fight
Six times I've failed for freedom's right
many were slain for crown and the king
Six times he tried to spin the web
Six times he failed at the silver thread
My orphaned land is lying in the sand

The wind howled louder
Fire had died down
I'm lying on my bed
With the spider around

Spider - spider
What have you done
Spider - spider
The battle has begun

His courage and skill brought back the will
For my return at Bannockburn
We'll never be slaves up to our graves

The wind howled louder
Fire had died down
I'm lying on my bed
With the spider around

Spider - spider
What have you done
Spider - spider
The battle has begun
Spider - spider
What have you done
Spider - spider
The battle has been won
