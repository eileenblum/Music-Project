They came across the sea from a land of cold and ice
With steel and blood we paid, we paid a very high price
Took us as slaves and suppressed our souls
Till we fought them back, took them under control
Battle cries we heard calling out of the distance
Cursed them to hell as their bow fought the swell
Our ship stomped like a moth in the firelight
They flee like dirty dogs in the darkness of the night

We never never never ran away
Forever ever ever we will stay

From East to West, from North to South
Brave men followed me
Across the land, across the sea
We died to be free
We will never be strangers
We will never surrender
As rebels we came
But we are still the same

In our hearts we're free, defeated our land
Kilted soldiers stormed, blood ran into the sand
We carried out the flag, against all enemies
We destroyed the tyrants, for our victories

We never never never ran away
Forever ever ever we will stay

From East to West, from North to South
Brave men followed me
Across the land, across the sea
We died to be free
We will never be strangers
We will never surrender
As rebels we came
But we are still the same
