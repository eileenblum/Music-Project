Through woods and stones they crept like snakes
Hunted our hives and fished from our lakes
They stepped on our land and this was forbidden
They didn't see us cause we were hidden

In one fatal moment we caught them all
Captured and imprisoned in the mighty hall
Bound and gagged we brought them to court
We executed thirty six, at our fort

We take revenge for the atrocities
Drinking the blood of our enemies

From highlands to lowlands
Brothers in mind
We love and we hate
We fight till we die
We're marching we're riding
For glory and fame
In the valley of tears
Blood is our name

Out of the darkness they came with murder in mind
The Campbell gave orders the King had signed
Put all to the sword and bring them to death
Put on their graves the Laurel wreath

We take revenge for the atrocities
Drinking the blood of our enemies

From highlands to lowlands
Brothers in mind
We love and we hate
We fight till we die
We're marching we're riding
For glory and fame
In the valley of tears
Blood is our name
