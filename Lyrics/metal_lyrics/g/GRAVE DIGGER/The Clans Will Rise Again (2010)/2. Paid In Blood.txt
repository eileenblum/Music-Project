Through corridors of darkness black horses ride
Shields in the wind we try to hide
Thousands of soldiers riding over the hills
An not ending river we running for the thrill

At the horizon the sun rises up
Quietly we pray to the God above
To give us the power for the endless fight
To kill all the demons night for night

Back to back and eye to eye
Screaming and fighting our blood runs dry

They will never take our freedom
They will never take our pride
We will fight up to the victory
Day by day and side by side
They will never take our freedom
They will never take our lives
United we will stand - united we will die
And we paid in blood - paid in blood

In the battle of Falkirk I see my friends die
They are lying around and their souls fly high
The axe in my hands, here I stand still alive
My rebellion is over - it's my fate to survive

Back to back and eye to eye
Screaming and fighting our blood runs dry

They will never take our freedom
They will never take our pride
We will fight up to the victory
Day by day and side by side
They will never take our freedom
They will never take our lives
United we will stand - united we will die
And we paid in blood - paid in blood
