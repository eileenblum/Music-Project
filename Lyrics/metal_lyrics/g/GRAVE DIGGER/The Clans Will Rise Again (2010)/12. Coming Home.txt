For glory and fame I wandered the Earth
And now I've come back to the place of my birth
Where shadows turn human I see mountain streams
Ghosts of buried centuries in my shattered dreams

Winds and heavy rain
Beneath Scottish skies
Winds and heavy rain
But shining eyes

I play the tunes for my brothers and Glen
The woods of my childhood call me again
For the colours of freedom so far I did roam
Cause I'm the piper and I'm coming home

The sound of the drums from the hills far away
Like a thunder they roar and call me to stay
As a sailor a soldier as a brave true ancient Scot
I play my tunes for the freedom and a life full of rock

Winds and heavy rain
Beneath Scottish skies
Winds and heavy rain
But shining eyes

I play the tunes for my brothers and Glen
The woods of my childhood call me again
For the colours of freedom so far I did roam
Cause I'm the piper and I'm coming home

Winds and heavy rain
Beneath Scottish skies
Winds and heavy rain
But shining eyes

I play the tunes for my brothers and Glen
The woods of my childhood call me again
For the colours of freedom so far I did roam
Cause I'm the piper and I'm coming home
