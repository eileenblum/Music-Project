The war is over and people lying,
Dead and buried in mother earth
Corpses cover the ground and the world is dying,
Dead and buried an eternal birth
Alone and unknown they are lying there,
Awaken madness and sweetest sadness
Visions of the dark night,
A waking dream of life and light
Barks cross the river death,
Rain comes down upon their head.

Soulless creatures, bloodless shadows
Isolation all around

[Chorus:]
Spirits of the dead are calling
The unholy side by side
Bloody hope to mortals given
Spirits of the dead crawling through the night

Captured by insanity, captured by reality,
Looking back in melancholy
The good and bad, the worst and best,
Now they've gone to there eternal rest

Soulless creatures, bloodless shadows
Isolation all around

[Chorus:]
Spirits of the dead are calling
The unholy side by side
Bloody hope to mortals given
Spirits of the dead crawling through the night
