My heart is pounding, full moon is rising
My brain is crying, my eyes are staring
I know what will happen to my soul
Insanity will taken control

[Chorus:]
Sacred fire
Burning higher
Sacred fire
Is my desire

I feel the hunger, I feel the pain
I lick the blood, that's running through your veins
I bite your heart and lead you to death
Only the sacred fire can save your breath

[Chorus:]
Sacred fire
Burning higher
Sacred fire
Is my desire
