Welcome to the other side
There's no place where you can hide
Where demons rule with endless power
There you will spend your last hour
Unfortunately you are not in heaven
And your sins are unforgiven
You sold your soul and lived a lie
Don't ask me why you have to die

Step into the fire
You bloody liar

[Chorus:]
Follow your obsession
Get your funeral procession
Follow your obsession
Watch your funeral procession

Welcome to the other side
Where shadows live without pride
The fruit of poison takes control
And the mortals take it's toll
Blood stops running through your veins
And the death takes away your pain
On a bed of roses you're lying there
Motionless with this evil stare

Step into the fire
You bloody liar

[Chorus:]
Follow your obsession
Get your funeral procession
Follow your obsession
Watch your funeral procession

The enemies inside your head
Now they're gone or now they're dead
They're put your body to lie in state
And now you know this is your fate

Step into the fire
You bloody liar

[Chorus:]
Follow your obsession
Get your funeral procession
Follow your obsession
Watch your funeral procession
