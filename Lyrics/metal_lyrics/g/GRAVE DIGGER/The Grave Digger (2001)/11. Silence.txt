You are lying there, I hear no silent cry
A nameless spirit under the cloudy sky
You've left my life and you left my heart
I feel endless days of present and past

Eagles fly into the night
And the world seems to die
Please come back into my life
I need you warming light

[Chorus:]
I open the grave
And close your eyes
I touch your face
Where your spirit lies
Feel the silence
Feel the silence

Why have you left me - my beautiful one
I can't accept it that you have gone
I kiss your lips, your face, your golden hair
I'll see you in heaven, I will meet you there

Eagles fly into the night
And the world seems to die
Please come back into my life
I need you warming light

[Chorus:]
I open the grave
And close your eyes
I touch your face
Where your spirit lies
Feel the silence
Feel the silence
