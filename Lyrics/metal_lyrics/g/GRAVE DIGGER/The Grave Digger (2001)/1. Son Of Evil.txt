Unborn child of the coming darkness
Would you guide us through the time of dreariness

Face like an angel
Sing the Sabbath song
The power of evil
Poor child of sin

Licking my blood - this shadow of madness
Stealing my breath and leaving me soulless

[Chorus:]
I'm the fear
Deep in your soul
Cause I'm the son of evil
I'm the hate
I'll bring you to death
Cause I'm the son of evil

This nightmare roars - feeding despair
Breathing fire - disturbing the air

Face like a creature
Sing the Sabbath song
This Jesus of ruin
Praying with Judas tongue

My funeral is open and I'm buried alive
Birds singing poems of my satanic life

[Chorus:]
I'm the fear
Deep in your soul
Cause I'm the son of evil
I'm the hate
I'll bring you to death
Cause I'm the son of evil
