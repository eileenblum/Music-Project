[Japanese Bonus]
[by Iron Maiden]

O. K.
I'm just 16, stayed out of trouble
Out of money, out of love
I got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas and here I go

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
(Get out my way) (Play it)

I've spent the night in every jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free

Pulled her at the Bottle Top
The whiskey dancing disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
That's the way it's gonna be

I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free yeah
I'm running free
