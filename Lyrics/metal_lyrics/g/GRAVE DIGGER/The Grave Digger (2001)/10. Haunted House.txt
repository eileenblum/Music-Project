In the greenest of the valleys
Once a fair and stately palace
But when the night had thrown her pall
The deadly clouds awaken them all

On a black throne reigns upright
A faceless skull the kingdom of the night
Evil things no human kind
Heartless spirits cold and blind

[Chorus:]
Deadly ghosts in robes of sorrow
Deadly shadows in the morrow
Dancing round the home of glory
Enchanted by the melody
Haunted Palace
Haunted Palace

Hear the tolling of the bells
And the pain of the dead swells
Hear their voices screaming for life
Wanderer be careful cause they want your wife

[Chorus:]
Deadly ghosts in robes of sorrow
Deadly shadows in the morrow
Dancing round the home of glory
Enchanted by the melody
Haunted Palace
Haunted Palace
