It's twelve o'clock in London town
Human beings creeping round
Pestilence all over the land
People dying and there's no end
Screams and laughter fill the air
The undertaker is everywhere
He's celebrating his bloody meal
If there's no money there's no deal

[Chorus:]
Cause he's the king
King Pest
Be my guest
King - King Pest
He takes the rest
King - King Pest
The unknown guest
King - King Pest
He takes the best

Big black shape with a skinless smile
A pale white skull waiting for the time
Despairing screams echoe through the night
Disciples of fear calling for the fight
Between life and death no chance to choose
Try to pay the bill but you will loose
He collects the victims for the open hell
The king of destruction with his mortal bell

[Chorus:]
Cause he's the king
King Pest
Be my guest
King - King Pest
He takes the rest
King - King Pest
The unknown guest
King - King Pest
He takes the best
