Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered weak and weary
Lost my wife named Leonore
An angel now for evermore
Thunder, lighting crushed the sky
A raven stood before my eye
Flew into the chambers door
When such name as Nevermore

[Chorus:]
Raise your face to the midnight sun
Don't touch the angel, don't hide and run
Look into the eye of this evil toy
Fly with the raven seek and destroy

Caught from some unhappy master
An unmerciful disaster
The raven fades away my sadness
Made me smile but made me restless
Prophet said I, thing of evil
Haunted horror, priest of devil
Let me stay there with my pain
Demonic sorrow crawls through my veins

[Chorus:]
Raise your face to the midnight sun
Don't touch the angel, don't hide and run
Look into the eye of this evil toy
Fly with the raven seek and destroy
