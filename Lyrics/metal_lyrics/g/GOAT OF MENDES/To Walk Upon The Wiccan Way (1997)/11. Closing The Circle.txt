Youthful maiden, Mother, wise one
Thanks we offer thee
Honour and love go with you - Hail!
Farewell and Blessed Be!

Mighty Sun-King, Horned One, Stag
Spirit wild and free
We loved your dance, we bid you Hail
Farewell and Blessed Be!

Winds and breezes gently blow
Unbounded, wild and free
We thank you now and bid you Hail
Farewell and Blessed Be!

Sparkling fire, red glowing flames
So high and bright to see
We thank you now and bid you Hail
Farewell and Blessed Be!

Softly soothing waters blue
Of lake and stream and sea
We thank you now and bid you Hail
Farewell and Blessed Be!

Earth of green and flowers wild
So colourful to see
We thank you now and bid you Hail
Farewell and Blessed Be!
