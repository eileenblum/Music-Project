The crossroad's bathed in silvery lunar light
Arrive! Hecate, glorious Empress of the Night
The moon, your pale blue eye is gazing down on me
Heralds your presence, sweet nocturnal entity
Leave now the gloomy realms of the Lost and of the Forlorn
Light up your torches and guide those who are Paganborn

Fire - Lighning fills the crumbling sky
Water - Rain pours from the clouds up high
Wind - Sweeps across the barren fields
Earth - Is sated by the blood I've spilled

The wolves now sing their mournful tale of sin
To bid a welcome to their unforgiving queen
Wraiths and spectres leave their long forgotten tombs
To join our Sabbat underneath the crescent moon

I roam Acherons unsilent shores
Make raw strands of pure magic unwind
I am lupine, voluptuous and cruel
Nightly haunt of your weak and feeble minds
I am the purest of Black to be embraced by the seeker
The third aspect in the circle of life
By cold moonlight I prowl as the sun's getting weaker
Up from Hades I rise, for your lifeblood I strive
I'm Hecate!

We are the night
Witches and Warlocks join with me
Neath her blue light
Darkly Mother, Hecate

Powers unleashed
For her maternal trinity
Hail the Great Beast
Queen of Witchcraft, Hecate

We are the night
Witches and Warlocks join with me
Neath her blue light
Darkly Mother, Hecate

We're Paganborn
From the burning sun we flee
Under the Horns
Lunar Princess, Hecate
