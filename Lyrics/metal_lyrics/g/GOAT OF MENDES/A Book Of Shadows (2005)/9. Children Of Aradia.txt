All we assembled at thy shrine
Mother, darksome and divine
Thine the scourge and thine the kiss
Grant us power, grant us bliss
As thou were named of old by men
Artemis and Ceridwen
Hells Dark Mistress, Heavens Queen
Lady of the moonlight's gleam
In a place so wild and lone
We dance around the Sabbat stone
Aphrodite, Arianhod
Lover of the Horned God
Lore of the Witches Child we bear
Of Diana and proud Lucifer
In between Light and Dark we are
We're Children of Aradia
Heart joined to heart and lip joined to lip
Five are the points of true fellowship
That will bring ecstasy on earth
'Cause you're the Circle of Rebirth
"My daughter I've sent you, Witch
Child divine
Whose fathers proud light was forbidden to shine
The Rebel Angel's heirloom she bore
A book bound in shadows, filled with ancient lore!"
No more we shall know slavery
Under some upstart deity
The Witch Child taught us what we need
For fighting of the Christian creed
Lore of the Witches Child we bear
Of Diana and proud Lucifer
In between Light and Dark we are
We're Children of Aradia
Clad just by the sky we honour thee
As token that we're really free
For centuries we sang the rhymes
There will be no more Burning Times!
We're granted secrets, given spells
To give the oppressors their own
Hell
Their rules we all shall overthrow
No other Law but Love we know!
Lore of the Witches Child we bear
Of Diana and proud Lucifer
In between Light and Dark we are
We're Children of Aradia
Heart joined to heart and lip joined to lip
Five are the points of true fellowship
That will bring ecstasy on earth
'Cause you're the Circle of Rebirth
Invoke thy groom, the Goat of Mendes
Renew our powers to defend us
Join with thy children, grant thy boon
As we are drawing down the moon
So celebrate in greenwoods shade
With staff and chalice, stone and blade
Beneath the light of moon and star
We're Children of Aradia!
