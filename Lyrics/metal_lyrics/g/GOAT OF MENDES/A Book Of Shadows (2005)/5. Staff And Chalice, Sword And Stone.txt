Wake Up!
Eternal Champion
The One who's known by thousand names
Wake Up!
Time to prepare
To sail the endless Sea of Fate
Again...
(Scream)
Midnight, I'm lying in bed but I'm screaming
Although I'm still caught in what seems like a dream
Shadowy faces are constantly whispering in tongues
I recall from past lives and they're beckoning to me
The visions, the names, oh they are so familiar
I'm eternally doomed to remember them all
Somewhere in this intricate web of dimensions
Someone longs for a Hero to answer his call
Oh no! My feverish shouts of defiance
Echo unheard in the maelstrom of fate
My body and soul lie battered and broken
On this Wheel of Rebirth to which I am strapped
Once more I'm drifting away into the Unknown
To reincarnate into mind, flesh and bone
Once more to recover four artefacts needed
The Runestaff, the Chalice, the Sword and the
Stone

[Bridge:]
Eternal battle
Of Law and Chaos
The Cosmic Balance hangs awry
I'm doomed to stand
Between the Powers
Shout my defiance to the sky
A lonesome Champion
Trapped in Infinity
Within the Multiverse I roam
I am the one
Who's bound to wield
Staff and Chalice, Sword and Stone

[Chorus:]
A Staff of Runes
Axis of Fire
The Grail of Law
Unveils the Liar
Black Sword of Chaos
Fierce Storm it brings
An earthen Gem
The Stone of Kings
A host of Chaos rises
Tightening its grip across the planes
Forces of Law in dire retreat
Helpless to watch as Balance wanes
The Eldritch and the race of Man
Are moved as pawns in a cosmic game
By powers born out of their dreams
But for a dream no one can be blamed
And just a single champion
Is summoned forth to fight what futile seems
To battle ancient gods and show
That they are just a dream within a dream
I toppled the towers of Londra
Under a dying sun I fought on icy plains
As Mankinds designated hero
I utilized Eldritch powers to vanquish my own race
As the Pale Prince of the Ruins
I stood on MelnibonÃ©s raped and ravaged shores
NO!!!

[Bridge:]
Eternal battle
Of Law and Chaos
The Cosmic Balance hangs awry
I'm doomed to stand
Between the Powers
Shout my defiance to the sky
A lonesome Champion
Trapped in Infinity
Within the Multiverse I roam
I am the one
Who's bound to wield
Staff and Chalice, Sword and Stone

[Chorus:]
A Staff of Runes
Axis of Fire
The Grail of Law
Unveils the Liar
Black Sword of Chaos
Fierce Storm it brings
An earthen Gem
The Stone of Kings
Don't shed a tear
But Love isn't eternal
Nor Forces of Light
Or Powers Infernal
Just four Watchtowers remain
And one hero to unify all
A Staff and a Chalice, a Sword and a Stone
Eternally remain when all else is gone
Dreams, emotions and gods
Eventually will die
But Fire, Earth, Wind and Sea
Are the essence of infinity
