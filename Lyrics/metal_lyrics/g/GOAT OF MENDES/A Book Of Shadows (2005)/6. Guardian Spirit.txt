Finally the last leaf has fallen
From the withering tree of your life
Kind was your soul, wise your deeds for your loved ones
Vast is your shadow, bleak the space you abandoned
Now you are washed on eternity's shore
And this tightening hull is no more
I took his eyes
I struck him with disease
Most gruesome fate
To bring him to his knees
For those who're blind
Against the Christian Lord
Shall be destroyed
Along their Pagan Gods
At least you're free from all struggling
'Gainst a God you had been forced to love
An outcast of Eden on pathways so hopeless
Despised by a Saviour who plunged you in darkness
In peace now sleep far beyond all life's tortures
Pulled away from God's grasp by far more benign forces...
The pawn of God saw desperation
For lack of faith leads to damnation
They buried him in Christian filth
Against his faith, against his will
Those who had sacrificed their Lord
To cleanse them of their wickedness
And nailed him high upon a cross
So they might easier kiss his ass!
A kind soul cannot be defiled
And cannot be threatened by Hells
Fires from Below
For he was a true Nature's Child
And back to Nature he'll go
He refused to be Gods puppet
And he refused to bend his knee
So use your imagination on my fathers' damnation
May you find your salvation by drooling in glee!
As Guardian Spirit he will stay
Protects my life and guides my way
Now the warm soil rests thick on your body
With the dark night your blanket to be
In a garden of stones rest for aeons eternal
A birch on your grave grows as silent memorial
Enjoy in silence eternal embraces
The Earth Mother now your tortured body caresses
I took his eyes
I struck him with disease
Most gruesome fate
To bring him to his knees
For those who're blind
Against the Christian Lord
Shall be destroyed
Along their Pagan Gods
His offspring I eventually might take
Instead of his strong mind I couldn't break
His son I'll claim
And as soon he leaves his guard
I'll intervene
And grab him by the heart
I stood on the threshold of death
But all attempts on my life you could thwart
I now know that my life's got a meaning
And I know it from the depths of my heart
Father, although I am missing you dearly
I still know that your spirit lives on
When I look in those innocent eyes
Of my son and your heir, Gwydion
As my Guardian Spirit you will stay
Protect my life and guide my way
My Guardian Spirit you will be
Yesterday, Now, Eternally
Blindness and pain were your eternal companions
Now your soul is free of its carnal dominion
May your spirit eternally remain
Rest in peace 'til I meet you again...
