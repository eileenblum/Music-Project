Fighting hard against defeat
We are the agents of a new frontier
Technological gods
A race created by machine to kill, destroy and die

You're my enemy, and you'll suffer for it
So the war continues

We are the sacrificial knife
Placed upon an altar of despair
Manufactured chaos

No escape, your life is cheap
Nothing left, no way home

Battle cries prophesise the nature of the trauma in the air
Holocaust in total
Shrapnel reign, drops in iron burning death on one and all

You're my enemy, and you'll die the same as me
So the war continues

We are the sacrificial lamb
Placed before an altar of despair
To pay the ultimate cost

No escape, your life is cheap
Nothing left, no way home

Now the battles done
Buried in the silence
The last survivors will contemplate
The road that lead us here
We fight for our master's pleasure
And they ensure that we die

(in) War

So till your soil fertilised in blood
It's all that we are what we become
Slave energy for future crops to feed
(On) the ashes that remain
