I must be dreaming
Chaotic visions overwhelming
Something missing
Feel the absence (like a) yawning chasm
The cosmic rhythm
Swings from stable into fluctuating
The old imbalance
Shifts it's sites from ancient houses

Calling out in the dark of night
Fallen angel rising
Tear a hole through the veil of time
To the end of Eden's reign

This is not the end of us
We've just begun

Tiny seconds left
Balanced on the edge
Distil the cup of peace
An ocean of disease

Calling out in the dark of night
Fallen angel rising
Tear a hole through the veil of time
To the end of Edens reign
World reborn in the changing tide
The new dawn is rising
All the dead wood is swept aside
To rebuild the world again

This is not the end of us
Children of the sun
So why crawl beneath the gods
When you're made of stars

The sky is open now
The wheel has spun around
The blind of all can see that this leads to something
So start counting all the signs
That are perfectly aligned
They try to hide what is revealed
They pretend this isn't real

But we are all the last to know

So close your eyes
Stay asleep
Stay unsatisfied
Insecure in the day
Where there's no place left to hide

Calling out (in the) dark of night
Fallen angel rising
Tear a hole (through the) veil of time
To the end of Eden's reign
World reborn (in the) changing tide
The new dawn is rising
All the dead wood is swept aside
To rebuild the world again
