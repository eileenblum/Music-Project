Breaking out of this chrysalis bathed in new life
See the world through reanimated eyes
Evolution is done, waste by-product of time and light
As the cycle rolls on
Feeling human inside, contracting iris within the light
Living prominent dreams, new born foetal reality screams
Door is opening to the next stage of us

All that was broken down, scattered pieces of the dead regime
Fairytale debris field, depicting chaos driving change
Build upon the ruins and decay, fixated on recreation
While Shiva dreams innocent in catastrophic R.E.M

Blessed is the tune of the open wound
Singing songs of sacrifice and lessons learnt
Call my broken will to arms
To rise against the dust and build an order out of shed blood

Reaching undiscovered heights and greater depths of understanding
As we're writing of a history of broken dreams and shattered forms
All that never made it through was not designed for transformation
This dreaming is infinite, this mind (will) forever be unknown

Blessed is the tune of the open wound
Singing songs of sacrifice and lessons learnt
Call my broken will to arms
Dividing all the dust to separate the facts from what is known

Reach a renaissance in flames
Burning for the glory of it all
Casting forth to where the air is still
Dreaming deep within the cosmic hush

Dream in flames!

The apex reaches for an ounce of sunlight
The golden crown upon a moments head
We are the ones with a morbid fascination
Forsaken everything we've learned from this

So as quickly as it came it will wash away


The descent was sweet at first
But there is no chance of making it back

Nothing is golden now, bitter cracks in the foundation
Artifice broken down to expose the face of dying shame
Nothing is worthy here, bloated world is rank corruption
As Shiva's dream manifests to tear down fractured walls again

Blessed is the tune of the open wound
Singing songs of sacrifice and lessons learnt
Call my broken will to arms
To rise against the dark consuming everything that ever was

Every end fills a need that's beyond all control
Evolution becomes a waste by-product of time and light
As the cycle rolls on
Feeling human inside, contracting iris within the light
Living prominent dreams new born foetal reality screams
Door is opening to the next stage of us
