Night is running cold
As we prepare the feast
Remembering deeds, beyond the great sea,
Bunch of Vikings memories

Agnes, oh Agnes!
Jewel of Normandy
A generous gift from goddess Freya
In the pillage after victory

Agnes, Agnes!
Jewel of Normandy
A generous gift from goddess Freya
In the pillage after victory

Dance around the fire
That toasts the pig's skin
Rattle with moon, shuffle the stars
Let we have a parody

In this night we drink together
Countless horns filled with mead
Until the dawn calls
We stand on our feet with tencay

Agnes, Agnes!
Source of inner ecstasy
Scream in French as we hammer together
In horned symphony

Agnes, Agnes!

Scream in French as we hammer together
In horned symphony

Until dawn we speak
Of brave warriors deeds
Conquered shores, raided lands
Poor wretched enemies...

In those times we fought together
With Odhinn's blinding rage
No pain shall make us fall
Taste a bond to immortality

Sca is sliced with drakkar ships
It's time to slow, the winds of skips
Storms are defeated with mastery
Hands and wood in perfect synergy
Reigns, kingdoms, lands afar
All within a Viking's gasp
Dreadful incursion have no resistance
For without warning they are unleashed

With lightning speed they're complete
Decks are filled as lands are depleted
