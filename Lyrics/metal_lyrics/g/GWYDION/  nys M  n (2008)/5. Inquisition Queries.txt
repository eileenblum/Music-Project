Hands of the Light, tools of the Dark
Cleaners of souls

They'll torture me and punish thee
(for we are) Bearers of heresy?

Have I too much?
A richness to touch...
For the church, overmuch?

They'll torture me and punish thee,
Share a terrible destiny!

Learn from vivid fires
Beneath your bare existence

A ploy to command
Higher than priests and kings
Manipulate all decisions
Behind a feign spirituality

Act of faith is what I stand
To regain my stolen freedom

Followers of a wickedness
Darker than utmost sinner souls
Stunned by the immense power
A legacy of elder times

Accept, as undeniable,
The revered lore...

Screams of irony
Echos through the halls of time
For the schemes of humankind
Are impossible to control

Piles of wood are erected up the hill
Citizens gather to see...
Amusement of inquisitions times...
Morbid process of burning flesh

Deliverers of salvation
Architects of purgatories
Purifiers guided by light
Avatars to case human pain
What great spiritual power
What great benefit indeed...
Nothing better for such temptation
Than innocent human bait...
