Ages ago a secret was lost
The true tale of the Shapeshifter
How he escaped everlasting prison
â¦ How he baffled all other gods
So he could return to Midgard,
Before the end of time -- Ragnarok!

Muspel merged
With the energy of Niflheim
Thus, life was createdâ¦
Among the gods that were created
There was Loki, brother of Odhinn
Better known as the Trickster

His desire was to rule all Asgard
Bend every will to his own
Deception guided Lokiâs stepsâ¦
As none of the Asa gods would listen,
And none would follow his pathâ¦

Unable to convince a single soul
Vengeance tainted every upcoming deed
Then another chapter began,
As the creations of Gods
Were utterly destroyed

Even capable of shape shifting,
Loki was finally caughtâ¦
And promptly imprisoned
Aside of his son-wolf Fenrir
In a remote island, the Gulf of Black Grief
He was shackled for eternity,
A prison to last until Ragnarok

Satisfied, the Gods have returned
Underestimating his clevernessâ¦
Through the mind of Fenrir,
He command the Jotuns
To bring his salvation.

Giants invaded Asgard in a frenzy battle
Capturing the necklace of Brigantia
Surprised, Gods were slow to react
As the chase begun,
The necklace achieved itâs destiny

Drawing the power,
Trickster was freed
And returned to Midgardâ¦

This way the balance
Was level once again
Evil and good shared
The same opportunities
