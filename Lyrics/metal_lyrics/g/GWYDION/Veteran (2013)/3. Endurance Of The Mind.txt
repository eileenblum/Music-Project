Left behind is the comfort of plains
Ahead a harsh way to follow
Reversing course of rivers and springs
Until the top of mountains - the grove of learning

Overcome the holes in this permeable shell
Vulnerable to the edging bites of swords

Prepare to cope with an unforgiving reality
Carry a stoic heart whenever needed
Find balance in suffocating mayhem
Focus on its weakest point

Brave warrior, ready to face death for our cause
Reason! This illogic primitive emotions
Replenish a rational mind
Primordial fear? Jettison that fear!

Lips broken in cold, immersed in blood 
Skin turns dark as it pads impact
Gritting teeth gets a compass musical
A tested mind!

Left behind is the comfort of the plains
Ahead a harsh way to follow
Reversing course of rivers and springs
Until the top of mountain - the grove of learning

Prepare to cope with an unforgiving reality
Carry a stoic heart whenever needed
Find balance in suffocating mayhem
Focus on its weakest point

Brave warrior, ready to face death for our clause
Reason! This illogic primitive emotions
Replenish a rational mind
Primordial fear? Jettison that fear!
