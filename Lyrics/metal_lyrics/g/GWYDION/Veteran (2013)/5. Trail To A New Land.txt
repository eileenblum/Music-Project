Gulls harsh singing greets the day
Marvelous chant of shores!
Vicious storms, dry food scurvied mouth
First time in months, left behind at last

Living close to the concept of infinity
Time's progression is dim and slow
The purpose: to chase a new world
Expand the windows of our tiny home

Minstrel's delight, song of the daring souls
A madman's dream, a test to our fate
Outraged waves throw spent men overboard
Blistered hands grasp worn drenched ropes

You can't see in this paradise
Without handshakiing hell first

We travel, in a permanent motion
Guided by stars and planets alone
But to where?

Judging by these charts, 
we achieved the emptiness!
End of all things, the greatest of falls!
What is hidden beyond?
Which secrets to unfold?
A legend to rise, grow and form,
to last for eternity!

Thus we find the trail
to this new unclaimed land
Redefine the landscapes of the earth
Draw deserts, cliffs, mountains and plains
A veil was lifted, letting rays of light go through

Mark of ownership, unrolled exuberant banner
Twisting wildly under the fury of the wind

Collect the fruits of your bold charges
Sunken ships shall not rest in vain
Bloat the decks with spice and gold
Fulfill the hunger of a new empire!

Bathe in glory, defier of death!
Trick the elements, perils and succeed!
This day others should not forget!
Request a chapter in the annals of history!

Minstrel's delight, song of the daring souls
A madman's dream, a test to our fate
Outraged waves throw spent men overboard
Blistered hands grasp worn drenched ropes
