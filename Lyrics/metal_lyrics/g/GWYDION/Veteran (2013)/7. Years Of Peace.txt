With the mildness of dandelion spores
Dust clouds float gently,
embracing the absence of patterns
Finding dizzy sleep on this ground
Covering the golden booze,
oozing from a merry pile of jars

Slowly my eyes adjust to the clarity outside
Piercing the brain like relentless mining picks

Stubborn ember's light flickers and shut
Ashamed when obfuscated by the rising sun
Only for a brief moment,
It won't be long until they're lit again

Festivities are still roaring,
a homage to glorious days
After witnessing years of victories,
fierce and brutal expansion
What's next to come?

Now we can only rest, rest and eat
And drink, and smoke, and stumble, and roll
But even with these endless celebrations,
the horizon is a line of monotony
Surprisingly bitter gift for the accomplished success...
At least, for a warrior

We swirl, and dance like sottish creatures,
Expelling energy from every pore

We let morning invite us to sleep, 
something that night has evaded for many weeks...

Our dreams filled with vivid images,
The heat of battle...
Sweat dripping inside the armor

Slowly my eyes adjust to the clarity outside
Piercing the brain like relentless mining picks

Stubborn ember's light flickers and shut
Ashamed when obfuscated by the midday sun

Slowly my eyes adjust to the clarity outside...
NO!!!
