The drive which fed this lasting existence
Urge that impelled it forward, steadily on
Strolls unconcerned in our vicinity
Causing flashes to appear
swarm vision with images

Thrusting swords! Splintering shields!
Cries of war
Years devoted to relentless training

By fall, past century's outcome must be settled
One army will finally collapse, crumble, phase out!

Fight to bash away all foes
Clean this plague
Clean this taint away
To never return

Postulation of surprise
Anticipating the hunter's route
Lure his path with desirable baits

Thrusting swords! Splintering shield!
Cries of war
Discipline of persistence, progression

The time has come! Onward! Charge!!!

Distill chaos into measurable variables
Reject chance by principle
Confine luck to a damp cell

Theorem of Invasion
When the target is stretched too far

Apply tilt rule "divide to conquer"
Postulations of surprise
Anticipate the hunter's route
Reverse his nature
Transformed into a prey

By fall, past century's outcome must be settled
One army will finally collapse, crumble, phase out!

Fight to bash away all foes
Clean this plague
Clean this taint away...
To never return
