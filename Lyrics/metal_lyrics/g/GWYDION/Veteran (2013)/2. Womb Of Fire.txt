The immense front of water
disintegrates over the rocks
The raged sea rises, it bends,
and explodes delivering its foam
Iodized, scents of sea suppress
the yells which announce
A new life, boundless life

Destroy that barrier
Which keeps you in isolation
Follow the breeze,
let it guide your path

Organic combination of stardust
Chaos masked as order
Divine disciplined mass of cells

Gasp for air one first time
Newborn, be fed!

Far inside the guts of destiny (revolving)
He bears the fate of a warrior!
There's nothing to deny!

Bandua GodFather guide his path
May cover our foes with a burning wrath
How you'll survive? A mystery!
Fulfilled will be this prophecy!

Fire, it burns like fire... The womb unveils
Smell up the snow dear child
Inhale, feed up from what thin air provides
Exhale, let shallow breathing flow...

Bandua GodFather guide his path
May cover our foes with a burning wrath
How you'll survive? A mystery!
Fulfilled will be this prophecy!
Water is your element
And even tough thirst is what makes you move
It's in fire that your vision will come true
Yell, Yell, to Life!
