Which secrets are kept by this timeless being?
How much weight their branches have still to endure?

With a dense foliage it
Hides a cumbersome truth
For inwards is a burden of nine worlds!

Descending from the heavens
To the top of this giant tree
The air fizzles and sparks erupts
From nowhere to see

Multi colour rainbow named Bifrost
A highway to mortal's host

The cosmic tree, never rests, never plea
It's name Yggdrasil
Grows of the past and forever will last
Even with Nidhogg at its hell

Sturdy roots bind planes together
From Hel to Asgard
The spiritual and physical life
Is carried by elongated arms!

A channel of vitality to the slums
As a well, a spring, or a fountain it brings
Brings the substance outwards
Defiantly is resists to the passage of time
To never collapse!

But it's roots are chewed by the accursed Nidhogg
Other perils lurks with the form of ants
With hunger they feast upon it's buds and leaves

From the underworld
Serpents attack the most tender wood
Leaving wide gashes where pieces
of vibrant bark stood

Those wounds are repaired
Every morning by Norns
Sprinkling them with water
Preventing its decay

The cosmic tree, never rests, never plea
It's name Yggdrasil
Grows of the past and forever will last
Even with Nidhogg at it's hell
