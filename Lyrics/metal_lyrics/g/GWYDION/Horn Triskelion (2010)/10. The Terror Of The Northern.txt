On the verge of a new century
Pious lands were hit by tragedy
Villages licked by flames...
Trail of charred outposts becomes

With bare sails to penetrate the sea
Warriors carry axes through the sand
Few but valued as a great war-band
Which consumes human sanity

Survivors worked their prayer
To ward against this evil
Asked their lord to protect them
Against the terror of the northern

Concede the highest favour
Preserving and guarding bodies
Free us from the savage northern
Tribes who devastates our realms

They aged and young would have
Their throats slit
Frail maidens and lads too
Not a single trace of mercy

Repel the evil from us
We altogether implore
Bring thee the ruling realm
We plead on bare knees

To the king of glory
Who pity us with true peace
Soundness, hopes and strength
Give us peace and harmony

Bestow us unmitigated hope
Genuine faith also
Concede us continual charity
And let completed be

Sanctify our humble prayers
Availed in achieved this old
Glorious measure

Praise be peace and glory
To the trinity
Who is most-magnificent
For the people, Amen

Summa pia gratia nostra
Conservando corpora et
Custodita de gente fera
Normannica nos libera

Deus regna!

Repel the evil from us
We altogether implore
Bring thee the ruling realm
We plead on bare knees

To the king of glory
Who pity us with true peace
Soundness, hopes and strength
Give us peace and harmony
