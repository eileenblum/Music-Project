Among the battlefield
The lifeless steel shines bright
Somebody's groaning near
He knows he doomed to die
Soon Semargl will bring them down
Into the land of the Chosen One
Where they will get their bless
Into the Reign of Silence
The last rays of the Sun
Are fading in their eyes
Among the Battlefield
The Lonely raven cries
So far away from friendly home
Out of the land of Thousand Bogs
And they preare to fade
Into the Reign of Silence
The cold touch of skies
To all those who die
The winds from beyond
Are bringing the Night
Almighty Peroun take us to your realm
Soon Silence will rule
In this Pagan Reign
The Wisemen in white
Said Blessed is who's died
Preparing the death
They are making the Rites
Semargl will meet
Them at Golden Gates
Now there is no hate
Just equal in death
The Radiant God is fading away
The Gloomy Semargl is coming to change
They silently talk to the Homeland
Good Bye. This time is to die
Their life now flows away
And souls now leave their hearts
And nevermore again
They'll be back to the land of Sun
The last rays of the Sun
The last drink of the air
And they prepare to die
To go to Silent Reign
