I had vision from nowhere
I saw the dragon's flight
I was the crying willow when
White magpie was my bride
Now I am sitting on the throne
Incrusted with the flames
There is no doubt I shall re-born
But flesh will stay the same

The crooked fingers draw the line
Inside my inner space
The ancient spirits touch my mind
Through burnt skin of my face
I see immortals by my side
For aeon now I lust
The mystery will be my sign
My past life is a dust

Now I feel my disappearing pain
All I've felt my past life was in vain
Now I know the fire is the main
I know I know my name

Soul is the fire!
I know my soul is the fire!

I am the alien form of life
For those who lived before
There are no birds in skies of mine
I only dare to soar
No one will reach me at the top
Because the stones melt here
The lightning is to be my sword
The clouds shall be my steels

Now I feel my disappearing pain
All I've felt my past life was in vain
Now I know the fire is the main
I know I know my name
