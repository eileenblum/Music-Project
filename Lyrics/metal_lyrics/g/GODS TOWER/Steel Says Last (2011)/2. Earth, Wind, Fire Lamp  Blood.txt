At the dead of the night when the moon shines so bright
And the rowan trees're alright in the dark
When they come close to me then I breathe easily
Hit the light is around

Now we know where we are going
Kind of seeds we have to sow in
When you are ready then call me
To let turn alive Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood

Let me tell you the truth of the one lied to you
Realize break it through again and again
Turn around and you'll see what it's all has to be
The revival is near

Now we know where we are going
Kind of seeds we have to sow in
When you are ready then call me
To let turn alive Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood

We are Earth, Wind, Fire and Blood
