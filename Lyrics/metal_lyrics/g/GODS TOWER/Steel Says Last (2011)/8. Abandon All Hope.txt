Rise! The rage of our ancient pride
Raise! The flag of blood and holy light
Hate's the power we've been saving up
So let's fight them under red stripe on the
White flag fluttering so proud and free
We shall get our sincere liberty
Dreams of freedom are to get so real
There's no one who dares to stop us on this
Way of long-awaited sacrifice
Fire of justice burning in our eyes
We're the nation who can shake the skies
There's no one who dares to stop us on this
Way we march together in all arms
Now's the time for us to put out stars
We don't like and to light new ones up
So let's march on under red stripe on the white

Bells are calling us to gather up
Hail to true and ancient our Gods
Hail to all the people who act free
What will be will be but we shall raise the
Flag of true and real liberty
Raise! The flag of our History
There's no way to suffer lies around
That's no more we're going out of underground

Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!

Light of darkness we don't ever mind
All we see the years of lies behind
Now we are to break it finally
What will be will be but we shall rise to
Live forever mighty, proud and free
It's the only way for us to be
You can run but you can't ever hide
We shall kill you if you're our enemy

Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!
Abandon all hope!
