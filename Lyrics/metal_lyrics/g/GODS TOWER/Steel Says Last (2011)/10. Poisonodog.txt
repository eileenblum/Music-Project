Now! He hangs around
I know here comes the hound
With the fangs besprent of
Poison! He's breaking bounds
In the name of the mounds
And the end is getting
Closer! Rushing through woods
Breaking trees, tearing roots
Desecrating our
Temples! He is the dog
Howling out in the fog
And I know he's just a
Dog with scimitar!
Poisonodog!
Why should we all die?!
Poisonodog!
Why should you live?!
Ground! Crumbling away
Because this is the day
Of the came the coming
Over! Just feel the pain
And the beast is unchained
While the world is growing
Older! Forest is dead
And the fields boiling red
And the rivers getting
Frosen! Time is up now
And you can't stop hound
And I know he's steelclad
Dog with skimitar!
Poisonodog!
Why should we all die?!
Poisonodog!
Why should you live?!
