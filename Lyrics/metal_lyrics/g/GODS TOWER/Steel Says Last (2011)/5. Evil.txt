Evil makes us hypnotized
In my world is it my life
You saw me burnt and you can feel it
All I know that evil lies
World is what we want to be
That's the same all history
Forever lost and you can touch me
All I know that evil wins

Evil! Evil?
In my world is it my life

World is what we want to be
That's the same old history
All was a dream all was unreal
Real world we'll never see
Evil makes us hypnotized
Someone's crying on my side
You've got this law and you can touch him
All I know that evil lies

Evil! Evil?
In my world is it my life
If you think I'm a liar you could be right
I don't know, I don't care and I won't realize
I'm a doors of the house of illusions
If you wanna know why then you're gonna just dive
Into the depths of your inner streams
Into kingdom that never have been
Everyone's just a slave of illusions
If you wanna knowÂ  why then you're gonna just dive

Evil makes us hypnotized
Someone's crying on my side
Forever lost and you can touch me
All I know that evil lies
World is what we want to be
That's the same old history
Forever lost and you can feel it
All I know that evil wins

Evil! Evil?
In my world is it my life
