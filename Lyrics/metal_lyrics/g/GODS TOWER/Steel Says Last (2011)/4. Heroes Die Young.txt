Bright life time is speeding up
My bird is rushing
Steel wings instead of my hands
No! I will smash them

The height is the battle
My majestic battle
And without this battle I will die
The height is the battle
My majestic battle
In the battle I only can fly
Razing them to the ground!

Are heroes like arrows
The life is proud but the warriors die young

Once more I have hit the mark
My foe is burning
Respite... but it never stops
I'm always learning

The height is the battle
My majestic battle
And without this battle I will die
The height is the battle
My majestic battle
In the battle I only can fly
Razing them to the ground!

Are heroes like arrows
The life is proud but the warriors die young
My war is the height now
War spirit I hail
I am like a rider
From most ancient tales
Like retaliation
I am falling down
I'm take them to hell
If I have to die young!

The height is the battle
My majestic battle
And without this battle I will die
The height is the battle
My majestic battle
In the battle I only can fly
Razing them to the ground!

Are heroes like arrows
The life is proud but the warriors die young
