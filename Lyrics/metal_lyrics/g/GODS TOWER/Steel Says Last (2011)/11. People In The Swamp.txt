Alone in the own country
There's no escape and no wind from other side
Among the fallen bowed trees
No more hope and freedom in the eyes
The bog between two dry lands
Everyone has invisible big hump
Unfabled reign of silence
Inhabited with the people in the swamp

Among the fallen bowed trees
No more hope and no freedom there is at all
Life seems dead unknown actress
Who died of grievous silence in the hall
They swim downstream like a driftwood
That's the price of a calm and quiet life
Some shelter and some simple food
What can you ask for if you live in a lie

The bog between two dry lands
Everyone has invisible big hump
How can you use your talent
When all the time you have to go over bumps
Life taught not to trust anyone
Rich neighbors used to rob you with brazed smile
The grace is false under the sun
Meanwhile the swamp slowly devours you alive

Unfabled reign of silence
Inhabited with the people in the swamp
Ignoring any violence
Don't you become unfeeling as a stump
I will not longer talk to you
Chasing welfare you have lost intelligence
The story ends to tell the truth
Drowned man alive and there is no second chance
