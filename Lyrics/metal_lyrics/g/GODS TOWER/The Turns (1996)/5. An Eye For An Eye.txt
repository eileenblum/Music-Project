I pray my Lord
To keep my reason clean
To keep my old sword keen
My prayer is my wing
I have to die or win

Let there be war for justice
Let there be war for honour
Let there be war for vengeance
Let there be war for power

I pray my Lord
To let me drink my wine
To save me if I die
Before I end my life
To let my starshine bright

Let there be war for truth lost
Let there be war for homeland
Let there be war for true laws
Let there be war without end

I pray my Lord
To let come true my dream
To make me fast as wind
To keep my old sword keen
I have to die or win

Let there be war for Heaven
Let there be war for lifetime
Let there be war for ever
Goddamn an eye for an eye

I call my hords
I call them all
I know they want
To support my Holy war
I pray my Lord
To bless my life
To bless my sword
My war an eye for an eye
