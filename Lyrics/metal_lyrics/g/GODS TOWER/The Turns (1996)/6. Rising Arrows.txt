Sunrise here we go
To start the show
Arrows let them rise
The springtime comes
Leda now you rule
We hail to you
Sunrise spirit comes
It's born by you

Rising Arrows

Master here you are
The Radiant
We are looking for
A light of your land
Arrows let them rise
Into the skies
Fire in my eyes
I see your shine

Rising Arrows
