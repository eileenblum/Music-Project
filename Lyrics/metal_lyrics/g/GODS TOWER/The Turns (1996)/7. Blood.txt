Always blood is flowing on
And coming through the walls and
Always blood in dreams
Excitig thoughts the blood is real
Always we are hungry
Looking for tranquillity and
Always we can wind it
Start enriching in the bloodfeast

Always truth is blood and
Blood is flesh and flesh is skin and
Always skin's to tear to
Eat the flesh to spill the blood out
Always drink it on to
Spend this life forever it was
Always never ends
There is no law the truth is bloodfeast

Always truth is one
Is only one the real thing and
Always means this one
Is our cores these cores are selves and
Always selves are souls
The truth dispersed in cosmic darkness
Always never ends
There is no law the truth in bloodfeast

Always taste is red
And so delicious so eternal
Always blood is life
It rains outside and never becomes
Always bathe in blood
And choke with eat enjoy this fun and
Always we were blind
But now no more until the bloodfeast
