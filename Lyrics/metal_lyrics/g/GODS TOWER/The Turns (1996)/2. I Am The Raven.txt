I know my native mystery
My mystery's my fate to fly up
My fate to fly up liberty
My liberty's my ways in sky
Why call me back from Heaven?
I am the raven bird of grief
I am bird of grief the sorrowbringer
Why call me back from Heaven?
Black sorrowbringer misery
I am misery the lament singer
Why call me back from Heaven?
I prayed my Gods to give me wings
Give me wings to learn to fly
There is the Heaven far away
Far away from greed and lies
Why call me back from Heaven?
There is no evil in the sky
In the sky there is no evil
Why call me back from Heaven?
See raven flies up liberty
My liberty is when I'm flying
Why call me back from Heaven?
I fly
