When the Sun is dancing
Rolling over Hills of Noone
Butterflies are lazy
Madness is what I discover
Distant sounds of strange ways
'T means the sunny days are over
Someone knows of my name
Universe of disorder

Curtain disappears
Doomsday show is going on
Something in my ears
Music of my narrow home
Twilight Sun is actor
Really great eternal hero
Happy end of this world
The end of show is near

Broken hearts are bleeding
They feel sorry for this story
Noone can't stop heeding
Hailing to the actor's glory
Twilight Sun is dancing
Rolling over Hills of Noone
Warriors of wasteland
Singing "world is over"

There is a home I live alone
The storming waters in my pond
Unbeaten tracks and endless road
Since the creation of the world
And I don't pine for if I die
And I don't pine for if I lie
No way to see the crown of skies
Because that fire in my eyes

And I don't pine for
If I go insane
And I don't pine for
If I were afraid  
And I don't pine for
If you say hello
I'm only dreaming
I shouldn't care at all
