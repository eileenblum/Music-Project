Look into my eyes and you'll see your fate
Dancing in the shadows of the fairy-tales
Turn your-self off this world come with me
Turn your-self off let me show your dream
We shall see the place everything goes by
Somersaults in dew of the morning light
Spirit of the life dance is all around
Here we go to fly up high right now

Meditate my pupil you're not alone
Forget the time when you were on your own
Never be afraid to look around
Everything is yours don't let me down
Knowledge that you feel is so mysterious
That's the way that new reality goes
Strange world that you see is not a snare
Potion of the dream is boiling there

Salting leather rolling turning
Make my business witchery
Dreaming waiting hearing clouds
Are whispering to me
Riding horses of the sunrise
Calling spirits of the trees
Don't you see I got the knowledge
Of Ancient Mystery
