One who waits in mysterious land
He can see Seven Rains
Come with me let me show you the way
I'll take away
And now you've gotta be afraid
Seven Rains of Fire
Look at me and you'll see my crown
I'm the king on the run
I am rich, I am poor, I am dead
I will show you land
And there you've gotta
Seven Rains of Fire
I make me up now I am there
Now I don't care
I'm really here I'm really there
So why do you stare?
It's time to tell what do I want
You're waiting for,
You're waiting for
So let us go to move the hills
To show what you have got really to fear
Seven Rains of Fire
They're watching you
Na-na-na I'm a prince of a dark
I'm a king of a light which of us doesn't fight
Every night that I cannot sleep
I try to see in my telescope
There I see that the planets come down
I look around na-na-na-na-na
Light of dark and the dark of dark
And the rain of rain and that pain in the brain
But they're watching you
And they're watching me
And they're watching us
And they're watching everyione
Seven Rains of Fire
They're really watching you
