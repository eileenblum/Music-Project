There is a monster deep underground
Nuclear warhead and steel
It's full of wires the iron hound
It's always in for the kill
There's no thinking just plan to ruin
Warplanners worship the death
The global murder is what he needs
The whole world is to be craze.

Everything that you love and adore
T'will destroy instantly
Living in dream of final world war
Entity of steel and hate
We don't need to ignore
Power &amp; Reason

Nuclear warhead Reactive heart
Created only to thrill
Somebody's dreaming to press the start
To break the peacemaking seal
The mind is hidden nobody knows
The temple of holocaust
The final countdowns to final show
We know the reason is lost

Everything that you love and adore
T'will destroy instantly
Living in dream of final world war
Entity of steel and hate
We don't need to ignore
Power &amp; Reason
