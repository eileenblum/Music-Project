First day we make axes of stones
Weapon of wild ones, blood flesh and bones
Second day we got swords of steel
Growing so stronger learning to kill
Third day we became archers
Spitting with death, the cold blood butchers
Fourth day we've found out a powder
The mighty dust to amplify our power!

We shall rise again!
Civilization! Look at me!
Civilization! I am free!

Fifth day we've invented the tanks
Machine guns and mustard gas
Sixth day we've built aviation
To rule in the air, to sow extermination
We dropped the bomb, we washed all away
But next day there were stone axes again!

We shall rise again!
Civilization! Look at me!
Civilization! I am free!
