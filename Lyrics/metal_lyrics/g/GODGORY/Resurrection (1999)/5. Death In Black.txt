I am the harvester of life
Making your life black
I have called your name
There's no turning back

I am, the death, ruling, with your time
I can, but I won't give,
you the time you need 

You fear me more than ever
You know your time is up
I take away your sorrow
I rule your mortality 

I am, the death, ruling, with your time
I can, but I won't give,
you the time you need
