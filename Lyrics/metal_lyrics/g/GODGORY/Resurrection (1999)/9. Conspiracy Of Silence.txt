[Bonus Track]I see my ugly face staring back from broken glass
I see my pain staring back at me
Inside my secret place in the dark
I hide from you in my dreams I pay you back with pain
The monkey on your back haunted you
we covered it up
twisting, tangling in the spider's web
We never said a word no one knew
what we went through
All the children hid in their own shame

No more lies light a candle in the darkest cave
Misery tears flows when the silence breaks
Waves of grief sharp nails in unhealed wounds
Conspiracy of silence

We hated to love you but we did
right to the end when the demon took your 
life away
The silence was a lie now it falls
into the light
It hurts so much but this has to be

No more lies light a candle in the darkest cave
Misery tears flows when the silence breaks
Waves of grief sharp nails in unhealed wounds
Conspiracy of silence
