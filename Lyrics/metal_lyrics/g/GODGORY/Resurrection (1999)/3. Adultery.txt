Welcome
to the red light world
come to me child
and show me what you've got
no need to cry
as you pay
the price for my greed
my lust, my hunger

They came with promises of gold
but there where things untold
your flesh was bought and sold

and now you dance with the devil at night
the red lights burning bright
crawling at his feet, you're a piece of meat
being sold by your master
this is a one way journey to hell
you'd better serve your master well
in disgrace you kneel your wounds won't heal
the vultures feed on your flesh

Taste my fire
this is not love
sweet gutterchild
this is power
domination
the beast within
gets his prey
sweet flame you've burned
and now you're gone

They came with promises of gold
to late the truths unfold
your flesh was bought and sold

and now you dance with the devil at night
the red lights burning bright
crawling at his feet, you're a piece of meat
being sold by your master
this is a one way journey to hell
you'd better serve your master well
in disgrace you kneel your wounds won't heal
the vultures feed on your flesh
