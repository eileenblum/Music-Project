Deep inside of me
in a grave
lies the dreams that I
Cherished the most
I killed them all for you
all for love
that was my sacrifice
the price I paid

Standing naked in the pouring rain
no guiding light, no will to fight
mourning my dead dreams

I know that I have to
live the lie
the winner takes it all
the loser dies
deep inside of me
in a grave
lies the dreams that I
cherished the most

Standing naked in the pouring rain
no guiding light, no will to fight
mourning my dead dreams
