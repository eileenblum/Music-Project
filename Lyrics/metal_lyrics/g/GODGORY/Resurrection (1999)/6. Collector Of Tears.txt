Now I should cry
it was years ago
Inside of me
so much I can't control

I am hiding from life
I isolate my self
I keep it all inside 

I never speak the words
that tells how I feel
I walk around in silence
and hide from things so real 

I do not longer care
I am filled with fear
I hold back my tears
