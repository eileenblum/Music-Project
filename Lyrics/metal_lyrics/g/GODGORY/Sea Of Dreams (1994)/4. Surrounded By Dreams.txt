Cold December night darkness descending outside
Surrounded by silence and time
Dreams start to arise
I wish it was real I wish it was life

Escape from reality

All the dreams I have and I want them to come true
It will never happen wouldn't you be broken too
I sit here alone with all the dreams in my head
Please stop messin with me, stop messin with my head

When I close my eyes I still can see
All the beautiful places where I never been
I wish I could see this in reality
But I can only have it in my fantasy

Escape from reality

The places I have seen with my eyes closed
They are printed in my mind them I never lose
I can't visit them but they can't be taken away
In my memory forever they will stay

Sadness overcomes me my soul is unleashed
I spoke to my master who guides me in my dreams
I enter my dream world with tears in my eyes
Hunger for the beauty reality starts to die

I'm longing for my dreams everynight
cause they make justice to my life
When I feel the fear I start to dream
Reality I no longer can see

Escape from reality

If I don't have my dreams I don't have anything
All would be senseless why can't life be a dream
I'll try so hard to see joy in reality
But I have my dreams that's all that matters to me
