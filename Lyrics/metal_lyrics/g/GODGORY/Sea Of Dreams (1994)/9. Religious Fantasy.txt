Preachin' about a nice paradise
That don't even exists
You are so full of shit in your brain
That you don't understand

Someone created the lies that you buy
You believe in what they say
Can't you realize it's all fantasy
Find out when you die

You trying to talk to the people you meet
And they don't care a shit
You feeling helpless and out of control
Religion is your friend

Many other fools like you
Believe's in the same paradise
That must be something you just can see
Through your religious eyes

I guess that you never learn
When you die you gonna burn
Or rot away in the underground
And if there was a paradise
You gotta ask the reason why
You ended up in that place
I will never believe your lies
About the disgusting paradise

You were preaching about a nice paradise
That don't even exists
You were so full of shit in your brain
That you didn't understood

I hope you see there was no paradise
It was all in your eyes
Lived your whole life with the lies
I'm glad that you died
