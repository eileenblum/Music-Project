I am the blood flowing in your veins
I am the one who's making you insane
I am the one who's eating on your brain
I am the one who gives you all the pain
I am the demon that lives inside of you
I'll make you do thing you don't want to
I control you everything you do
I'll just say and you will obey

I am your heartbeat and your feelings too
I am the hatred you carry around
I live inside of you til you are underground
I am the tears you never cry
I am the demon that lives inside of you
I'll make you do thing you don't want to
I control you everything you do
I'll just say and you will obey

I have lived inside you for a long long time
I will surely miss you the day you die
Then I transfer into another body
I can never die I'll just live inside

I am the hatred when everything turns black
I am the one who gives you a heartattack
I am the one that make your wounds bleed
No matter what I'll do the guilt is on you
I am the demon that lives inside of you
I'll make you do thing you don't want to
I control you everything you do
I'll just say and you will obey
