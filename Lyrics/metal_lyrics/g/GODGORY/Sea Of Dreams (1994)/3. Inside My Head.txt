Welcome to a trip with me
Inside my brain to insanity
A guided journey to misery
You listen to what I say
I don't know you, you know my name
We sit and talk and you're gettin paid
I can't explain how I feel
When everyone is judging me

I hope you find the reasons why
I'm sittin' here and almost cry
It cuts so deep inside of me
But at the same time I feel complete
Is life a mission or is it a gift
I can't think more see you next week
What would you think if I told you the truth
In this world we are born to loose

The thoughts I have is makin me
So afraid for reality
I'm sittin' here in the chair again
Speakin emotions direct from my brain
I can't tell this to anyone
Just the ones there trust is found
Maybe you think I'll be better of dead
But I just wanna know who I am
