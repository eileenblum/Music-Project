The night is dark my heart is black
Sittin here alone with a candle lit
I mourn you taste a tear on my lip
Who decided that just you, you have to die

Shadows gazing and stands so tall
Moon is full and so is my head
You are now walking among the dead

Memories of you is all I got
In this world where everything is lost
I don't believe in good or evil
The only thing I believe is in sadness that I feel

Shadows gazing and stands so tall
Moon is full and so is my head
You are now walking among the dead

When I close my eyes to go to sleep
In memory I search so deep
Of the finest picture i got of you
You are not with me that's sad but true

Shadows gazing and stands so tall
Moon is full and so is my head
You are now walking among the dead
