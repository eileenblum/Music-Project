I am now layin on my deathbed
Cold and weak and full of pain
My skin is wrinkled and I'm searching
for a reason to not pass away

I have been sick for a long time
The cancer has taken my soul
I lay alone in a dark room
Wait every day to be fetched by death

In silence I'm lying
Deathwish burning strong
I just wanna sleep forever
I'm to weak to take my life

I am now dreaming that I'm dying
My soul is free from all the pain
I am now crying, crying in happiness
But I wake up to reality again

I hate this life that I'm living
People surrounds me to take goodbye
I can feel it this is my last time
I close my eyes and smile to my death
