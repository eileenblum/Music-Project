I am walking in the winter night
Under the moon alone
Shadows hanging over me
Like painful memories
Can't you tell me where I belong
In this society
I don't care about anything
It's all destiny

Someone else is telling us
How were suppossed to feel
I am so sick of it
the news on T.V.
If you don't feel like others do
Then you're a stranger
Can't help it but I hate it all
Then I'm danger

My head is full of voices
Which are calling me
I can't sleep because they speaking
My mind is full I want it free
Sometimes it feels I wanna cry
I wanna scream I wanna die
Can't you see I'm afraid
To fall a sleep and let voices take
Control of me like they done before
I'm not sure I can take no more
Sometimes I need to clear my head
In silence, In silence forever

Sometimes I need to be
Alone in silence
Sometimes it's hard to be
solitude in silence
I guess it doesn't matter to you
How I am feeling
That's the sign you're giving me
When you never set me free

I am walking alone again
No one can touch me
I need this to clear my head
The cure is pleasing
