When darkness is fallin' and you feel alone
You pray for love but none you found
The girls in graves are callin out your name
You gonna get love but it's from the underground

Your paralized legs starts to walk
The moon is full and the shadows crawl
Cemetary is misty and cold
You wanna have love but with no one old

You look at the stones and read their names
You startin to dig you feel insane
The spade hits the coffin you get a chill
This one is dead you don't have to kill

You have just commited a crime
But you don't care the girl was fine
What will you do when you are done
Were you proud with yourself when you made love

You know it's wrong to dig up people from the graves
Is there something that is'nt working in your brain
When you were younger no one gave much love to you
Alone in this world no one knows that you exists

You're a psycho and sick to the core
You dig up the girls and make them to whores
Don't you know that is wrong
The dead are helpless and you're feeling strong

Is this some kind of revenge
When you were little no one gave you a chance
No one knows what's going on in your head
All we know you make love to the dead

Now you are dead and gone and lyin' in the dirt
The dead ones rest in peace they are no longer disturbed
