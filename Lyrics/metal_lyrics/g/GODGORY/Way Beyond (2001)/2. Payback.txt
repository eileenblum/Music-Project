Let the truth be known
We've seen the world
Painted in blood
It lights a fire of rage in our hearts
That never burns out
Indescent, unholy
We will never believe in your lies
Perverted, unworthy
You can call us whatever you like, cause

Beware! as we howl in the night
Sons of the damned
Beware! we will challenge your might

Hear them now
The desperate cries
From the lost world
For those who will never be given a chance
We must cry out

Indescent, unholy
We will never believe in your lies
Perverted, unworthy
You can call us whatever you like, cause

Beware! as we howl in the night
Sons of the damned
Beware! It is time to payback

No more lies
From your black tongue
We will make sure
That justice is done so this world can be free
From your existence

Indescent, unholy
We will never believe in your lies
Perverted, unworthy
You can call us whatever you like, cause

Beware! as we howl in the night
Sons of the damned
It's time to payback in blood
