There is a voice that call to us from inside
it speaks of new time coming soon
We feel the scent of revolution in the air
The winds of change are growing strong
Let's make the temple shake
Tear it down, brick by brick
Life through death the only way

There is a wall of ignorance in our way
painted red with our blood
Let's kill the giants that stands in our way
because their time has long since passed

Let's make the temple shake
Tear it down, brick by brick
Stand up now, be not too late

Let's make the temple shake
Tear it down, brick by brick
