Rise
My disciples
Let no one live to tell
Hate
Can live forever
If it's nurtured well
They will never learn
Blood will flow again
War in the promised land
A never ending pain

Fight
In the alleys
Where stones are met with led
Kill
Our cause is sacred
Don't stop to count the dead

You will never learn
Blood will flow again
War in the promised land
A never ending pain

Death
Another vengeance
Uphold these morbid lies
Pray for this lost world
Where the children dies

We will never learn
Blood will flow again
War in the promised land
A never ending pain
