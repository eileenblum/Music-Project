Christians sentenced you to burn
Witchcraft is what you're accused of
The stake is already prepared
They know you won't go innocent from here
Flames is touching my skin
I'm screaming in pain
I pay for my sins

Flames hotter than hell, caressing my skin
My blood is boiling, over death I can't win
There's no escape, I'm turning to dust

People stare as my body burns
With pleasure in their eyes
I will come back to haunt you all
So don't sleep too tight

Flames is touching my skin
I'm screaming in pain
I pay for my sins

Flames hotter than hell, caressing my skin
My blood is boiling, over death I can't win
There's no escape, I'm turning to dust
