So now my time has come
There's no return
I hear the reaper call out my name
And I'm so afraid
Of that which will come
Help me
Hold me please
DON`T WANT TO DIE
Fear cuts like a knife in my flesh
And I'm trying to hold on to what I got left
But it's too late
Soon I'll be gone forever
Cold God help me I feel so cold
Can't you have mercy on this broken fool
Give me more time
Why can't I live forever

I'm standing on a ledge
Inside my mind
Staring down into the darkness of the abyss
The shadows from my past
Arise from the depths
Haunts me
Grasps me, as I begin
MY FINAL JOURNEY

Fear cuts like a knife in my flesh
And I'm trying to hold on to what I got left
But it's too late
Soon I'll be gone forever
Cold God help me I feel so cold
Can't you have mercy on this broken fool
Give me more time
Why can't I live forever

Come to as a child
Watch out these shadows will devour your mind
Come play with us now, forever
Reach out take my hand
I'll take you to a safer place

All is calm now
And the shadows are gone
The night comforts me
And I'm no longer afraid
My last thoughts goes to you
I pray that you will always remember
And as I walk away forever
I hope you will forgive me

This is the moment of truth
The time is right
I leave the burdens of life behind
And cross the river
Pass the coin to the ferrymans grasp
He will
Grant me
Eternal sanctuary

Free! At last I am on my way home
It's goodbye forever I'm not coming back
I won't look back
All is behind me now
Free! At last I am on my way home
It's goodbye forever I'm not coming back
I won't look back
All is behind me now
