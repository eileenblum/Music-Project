You let the world I love grow weak
And won't listen as I speak
Of children dying for profit's sake
You modern version of the snake
Innocent's fill the nameless graves
Their way out from life as slaves
You are a demon, a living curse
with a fat and bursting purse

Here comes that feeling again (I wanna scream)
There is a burning anger inside of me
It drows as life grows colder

I wanna make, I wanna make you pay for your sins
I wanna make, I wanna make you pay crush your skull
I wanna make, I wanna make you pay

The curse lives on inside of me
As I grow up with your eyes I see
We walk around with heats like stones
Your values breed onto our bones
I know the sale of another tank
Bring loads of money to the bank
But still I fight and struggle within
To be free from my father's sin
