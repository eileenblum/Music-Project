I thought you were sleeping in your bed
You looked so peaceful and serene
But you had left this stinking earth
Your soul flies free among the stars

Oh my friend I miss you so
and tears will fill this hole inside

By my friend I'll never see you again
We buried you in my mothers garden
Now you rest eternally

I know that death comes to us all
And now you're gone forevermore
Can't end this grief can't end this pain
The wheel of time is rolling still

Oh my friend I miss you so
and tears will fill this hole inside

By my friend I'll never see you again
We buried you by my favourite tree
Now you rest eternally
