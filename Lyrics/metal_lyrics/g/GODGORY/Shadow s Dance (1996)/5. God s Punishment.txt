When darkness came so silently
It was the end of humanity
All was burning nothing left to save
The streets turned into a mass grave
The people that was still alive
They pray to God with no faith inside
I have learned that he's the saviour
Is this a miracle of a faviour

When I see their faces melt down
Will I be the next one to scream

I'm strain to cry but no one cares
I'll just wanna die away
I'm not believer so I guess I've to pay
All alone in this forever

I'm closing my eyes and wish for my death
Mankind is dead but I still got my breath
I wander through the body filed street
All I see is human meat
Tell me why I'm the choosen one
To live in this earth without the sun
Cause I'm not a believer and I never been
I spend my days living in sin

There is no one left to scream
this is my life and not a dream

I'm strain to cry but no one cares
I'll just wanna die away
I'm not believer so I guess I've to pay
All alone in this forever

I won't give my life to the Christ
Get feeded with religions lies
I will create my own path
Sooner or later I will meet my death

I got no saviour for my soul
I don't need no fuckin lord
If it come to heaven or hell
It doesn't matter that I'm already dead
Because I don't matter that I'm already dead
Because I don't believe in his lies
He showed me that I can't die
If he is so good and bring happiness
Why does he give non believers punishment

Now the lord has showed his mightiness
I'm condemned to live in his nothingness
