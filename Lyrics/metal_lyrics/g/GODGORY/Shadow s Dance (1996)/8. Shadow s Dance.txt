The terror comes at the end of the day
When all my strength has withered away
The flow of time has touch so cold
Its freezing me as I grow old
I pass into another sleepless night
to carry on this endless fight
To reach the stars and find peace of mind
But I am lost I stumble like behind

Struggle on all in vanity
Struggle on lose my sanity
Here they come again (madness)

At the end of the day I lie
In darkness I start to sweat
As anguish embrace my soul
I'm crying at twelve a clock
The shadows starts to dance
I'm spinning I see them
Whirl in the shadows dance
IT RILLS ME

Oh my god I feel so alone
This nightmare wears me to the bone
Nowhere to run? nowhere to hide
The terror twists me from inside
Everynight it's all the same
the shadows play their wicked game
Just when I think I've scaped the pain
The shadows rise and come again

My sins are haunting me over and over again
I am on my knees praying for morning to come
But the night is long, seems that it will never end
when the sun won't come and chase all the shadows away

Then at last the first sun ray
Marks the begining of another day
I look around all the shadows are gone
And for a while I am left alone
But I know I will never be free
Cause the shadows are living inside of me
And everyday when the night draws near
I start to tremble and shiver with fear

Struggle on all in vanity
Struggle on lose my sanity
Here they come again (help me)

At the end of the day I lie...
