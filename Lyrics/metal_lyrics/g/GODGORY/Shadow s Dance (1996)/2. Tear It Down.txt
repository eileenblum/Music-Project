There is a voice that call's to us from inside
It speaks of new times coming soon
We feel the scent of revolution in the air
The winds of change are growing strong

Let's make the temple shake
Tear it down, brick by brick
Life through beath the only way

There is a wall of ignorance in our way painted red with blood
Ley's kill the giants that stands in our way
Because their time has long sine passed

Let's make the temple shake
Tear it down, brick by brick
Stand up now, be not too late
