No further offerings of our own flesh and bone, the stranger found in pieces on shore, has limbs to spare, and can grow more 

A sign, an omen, a living totem, a walking fountain of meat. 
Asteroidian limbs grow again and again, pleasing the pool of teeth 

Sacrifice anew of fresh sinew, his scent sinking like teeth in soup 
Sentries arise from the halocline 

Water will flow from elder to embryo, the driest of days are days of old, 
Bring every bowl, fetch every pail, cup thy hands both dry and frail 

We'll all be drunk with water again 

When we've regaled the demons enough, bring our gift back up 
And feed him well with the oiliest slop 

Yank the rope and hoist him high, he'll regenerate overnight 
When fins follow, let him drop
