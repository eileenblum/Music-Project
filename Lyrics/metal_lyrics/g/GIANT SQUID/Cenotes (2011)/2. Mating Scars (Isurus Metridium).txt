A bloodied rostrum and missing fins, teeth marks raked from gill to grin. 
From far away, it's easily seen, the ordeal through which I had been 

Specific gravity, taken it's toll, fateful events left their holes 
Teeth replaced from ones behind, nictating membranes hide swollen eyes 

Uncanny, I sailed straight to thee, in tonic immobility 
One drop in a million 

Spiteful seas and sharper shores, I'd suffer all again 
And navigate with magnetic pores, a thousand chance occurrences 
Uncanny, I sailed straight to thee, in tonic immobility 
One drop in a million 

To migrate is to suffer 
Like fleeting friends, thermoclines come and go 
A family asunder, I cheers the deserters, 

An unfathomable reward, now breaths and grows
