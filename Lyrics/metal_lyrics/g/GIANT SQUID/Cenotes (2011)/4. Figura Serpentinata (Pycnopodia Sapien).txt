Donât let them know what the child can do 
Put him to sleep with the strongest brew 
And make him more symmetrical 

Burn all the pieces, leaving not a quantum 

Donât let them know what the child can do 
Growing back three where there was two 
And keep his reach contralateral 

Donât let them know what the child can do 
Cover him in ochre to hide his Linckian blue
