Former alps make reluctant isles, ants in a storm, we are all condemned 
Now the greatest minds sit not on spines, we are all their nutrients 

Every drop of reserve, unfrozen, still did not reach the highest peaks 
So a clever, brine cracks a faucet of time, pouring archaic seas, 

Each set of waves smarter than the last, climbing tides never recede 
Once benign pools now smile right back, patient for us to concede 

A millennium, ago, my father was of my age, rumor has it, I look just like him 
Subterranean rivers flow through chrono fissures, I will follow them and see for myself
