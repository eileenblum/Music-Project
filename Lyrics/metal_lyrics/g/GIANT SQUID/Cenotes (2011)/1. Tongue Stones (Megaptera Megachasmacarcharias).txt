What was the catalyst, the final offense, that forced her presence 
To intervene, to make known, this planet of stone, is truly her bone 

And her flesh, ripples with troughs and crests 
And our lakes, are her breasts 
And her veins, quench our thirsts 
But we pour our filth in first 

Our judgment came not in flame, but in flood 
A crawling lake of brine, thick with oil, thick with blood 

Beg for, forgiveness from higher ground 

Scents of cetacean serpents carried for miles 
One baleen grin hides another serrated smile 

When, pectoral fins block out the sun, all is lost 

For those out of her reach, she'll swell rivers into the creeks, 
Pushing creeks into the streams, until the highest lakes boil and teem 

Torrential flows carving pinnacles clean 
We are debris from which god's hands filter feed 

When new shores lap at our highest peeks 
The world as we know it will flow past their teeth
