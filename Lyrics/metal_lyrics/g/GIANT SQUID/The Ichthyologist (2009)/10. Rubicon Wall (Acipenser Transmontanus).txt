I chose this place because it has no bottom to interfere with my fall
Anaerobic beds of silt preserving still the shock of what I saw
Vivid descriptions I'd do anything to forget
But here I am crushed by a million frigid tons of regret
I will rest in one piece away from clawed things that would otherwise eat all that's left of me
The world is not ready for what I saw down there
That fateful day starting an endless autumn, words did seer my pupils
Liquid acrylic quickly will freeze a broken will in water heavy as tar
Somebody please take me to the deep where I can carry the weight of this burden you left for me to bare in frigid waters high above my head
Surrounded by all the dead frozen like me in the saltless sea
You can pay your respects at the shore now
Goodbye, my love...

I chose this place because it has no bottom to interfere with my fall
Anaerobic beds of silt preserving still the shock of what I saw
Vivid descriptions I'd do anything to forget

Thanks to minigorbi for correcting track #8 lyrics.
