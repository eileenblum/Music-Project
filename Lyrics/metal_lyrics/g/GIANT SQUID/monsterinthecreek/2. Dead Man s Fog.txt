Our bow cannot be seen
From where we stand on the stern fog has taken everything
The men's faces show their concern
The cold is worse that we feared
I despair the end of my years

[Pre-chorus:]
The more it stings the more I try
Keep waking up each time I die a little death I cry
A thousang leagues a million miles
The secrets buried in the vault beneath the oceans wide

[Chorus:]
This beacon's light has burned for as long as I've known
Though tonight the horn must bring us in
For the tower ceases to glow dare we raise our anchor
Let the tide have its way
When waves crash on shores unseen jagged reefs calling our names

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
