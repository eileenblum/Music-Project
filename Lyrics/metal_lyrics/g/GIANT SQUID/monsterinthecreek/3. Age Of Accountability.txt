As truth's war still plummets
I'm sick to my stomach for my rose I would leave
My barren lonely star
Sketch me a picture
Use only your mind
My imagination will make it turn out just right

[Chorus:]
I would give everything
Gathered from worlds afar
Sift through realities
Figure it out
One world to another
Search the heart of man
To die in the dreamland and never walk free again

[Chorus]

The fact that you are alone
So full of infertile grounds weak and oblivious
Speaking without a sound
The boy's soul plummets
I'm sick to my stomach
For my rose I would heal any scare
Unlike me her wound stay open and bleed
Left no choice head to the woods and flee
