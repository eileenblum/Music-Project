This wagon has lost its wheels
Now dig in with your heels and carry your own weight
With the snow up to our knees
All I can think is how you'll be

[Chorus:]
First to be eaten
You will you will
With the shit this deep you'll have to leave all the things behind that you don't need
You have fallen behind me
There is nothing left to eat

[Chorus]
