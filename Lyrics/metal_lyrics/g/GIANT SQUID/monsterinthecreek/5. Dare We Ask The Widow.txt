These castle walls are finished at last
Will they hold out the elements or just the past
Bury it all out in the yard
Down by the pond and the old livestock

[Chorus:]
Exactly where I wasn't shown
The site of his ashes now buried in snow
Now take this flock far into town
They have eaten our fields down close to the ground
With the master dead and planted deep
Who can possibly care for these tired sheep

[Chorus]

I can't reap what you've grown
I can't plow these fields alone
I can't bring the harvest home by myself and myself alone
These castle walls are finished at last
Will they hold out the elements or just the past
And bury it all out in the yard
Down by the pond and the old livestock
