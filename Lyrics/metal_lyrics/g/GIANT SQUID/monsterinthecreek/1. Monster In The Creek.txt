Old sea captain warned us today
When the lord surely looked the other way
Something in the stream outside of town
Reached up and dragged my poor child down

[Chorus]
Has the devil caused this hellish heat
To lure our children down to the creek
Eleven miles from the nearest waves
What manner of beast has swam in from the bay

Young man dive in with hopes to free
My boy's body from the jaws of the thing
At the deepest part of the swimming hole
Refuses to give back the life it stole

[Chorus]

Bring your guns and dynamite
The monster in the creek dies tonight
Fire at whatever moves within the muddy waters of Matawan
Life fuses tossed deep
We'll blow the demon right out of the stream

[Chorus]
