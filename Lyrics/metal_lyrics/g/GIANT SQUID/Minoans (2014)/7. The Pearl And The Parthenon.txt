I soldiered to the top of the Acropolis
With you, my love, strapped to my chest

Before you saw year one,
you saw the Parthenon
And left a shark as a gift to the Gods

Your sleep evasion,
led to our nightly excursions
Through the cobbled mazes of Athens

You were startled by the barks of stray dogs,
echoing off the ancient agora walls

Thank the Gods of Olympus,
that taverna's lights were still lit
And the inn-keeper knew,
which direction was best

Before you saw year one,
you saw the Parthenon
And left a shark as a gift to the Gods
