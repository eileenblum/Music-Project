These walls faced no foes
Nor challengers to the throne
Harmony and peace,
encased in a labyrinth of stone

Frescos fall around us,
and ceilings turn to dust
As the incisors of destiny,
sink deep into us

All the pottery we painted,
and the pillars we erected
Will anyone ever know of them?

For where we paved roads,
and convinced water to flow
Is falling through the cracks again

Our mastery of crop,
and proto-government
Will be buried in the memories,
of no living Mediterranean

We will be forgotten, we will be lost
A sunken island, legend to none
