How much is a palace worth?
Far more than this mound of dirt
Charge me what you will
I'll still make out in the deal

I'll buy the whole bloody island if I have to
And turn the damn thing upside down

There's more here than shards and bone
I won't rest 'til my spade chips a throne

I'll buy the whole bloody island if I have to
And turn the damn thing upside down

Too old are these ruins
I will make some new ones
