Centuries of brine bestow upon us endless power and meat
Tides are all the fortifications we need

To trade with thee, you must sheath your swords
Share your bounty or your bones will feed the coral

All of the Aegean sea bows in the shadow of Crete

Salinity births our prosperity
Behind unassailable sands lie uncanny luxuries

Centuries of bronze bestow upon us endless peace and meat
Dominate the waves and fortress walls become obsolete
