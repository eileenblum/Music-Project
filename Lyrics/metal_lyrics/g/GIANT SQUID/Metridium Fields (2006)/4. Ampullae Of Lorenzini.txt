Why weren't you here
When I stood alone
You won't believe
All that I've learned
And all that I have known

She pulls me through
All of her bodies
Calling out
Magnetically

Her depths hide nothing from me

I befriended deepest fathoms
And returned stronger still
Starving for your praise at the crest of every swell
I find dissuasion of tides
I find dissuasion of tides

She uses no words to reveal her deep
Your shallows blur all that you speak
To the equal before me
I find dissuasion of tides
I find dissuasion of tides
