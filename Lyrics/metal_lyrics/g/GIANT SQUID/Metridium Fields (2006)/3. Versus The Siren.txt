She wails and whispers longingly
Calling out to those no longer listening
Her sweet incantations lost in infamy
Siren fools no one but still she will sing

Fall just like those before you
I will
Fall just like those before you
Pass still

Her lure can redirect the oldest currents
Countless have fallen before
Where winged feet will soar
Fall just like those before you
I will
Fall just like those before you
Pass still

On by
And I will
Pass still
On by
