When you looked towards the heavens
You faced the wrong way
Your actions slaughter saints
To whom you need pray

No need to take communion
You've been feeding all along
On ancient existence
Old as time is long

The rising sun desecrates the embodiment
Of a blue earth
Destroying the balance of a system in place
Since all life's birth

Revolution
In the water

Untold treasures
Lay hidden inside
Bodies left plunging
A black hell awaiting

Don't swim through the water here
Don't feed from the food found here
What floats above all men must fear

Don't swim through the water here
Don't feed from the food found here
What floats above all men must fear
