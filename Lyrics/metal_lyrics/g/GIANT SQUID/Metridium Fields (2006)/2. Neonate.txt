You're free from your womb now
But this maternity ward is a feeding ground
Don't look back for ages
Your mother's toothy smile can smell you for miles

You too will eat your young
You too will eat your young
Consume all that crosses your path
Each morsel may be your last
Never cling like the remora
To those you spawned you in the past

You too will eat your young
When there's only enough for one
In times of need this must be done
From womb to gut it has begun

Eat your young

The songs of giants lure you
Will you follow
Their scents of gluttony tempt you
Will you follow

Energy is precious and journey long
Feed now and breed again
The birth is food
Now feed on

Tides pull and convince
Their direction is the best
Waves hide all that lies
Well beyond their crest

You too will eat your young
From womb to gut it has begun
Eat your young
