[Mitchie:]
Those eyes
Painted on my back
What the fuck is going on
Terror
Terror carving out my insides
Lost
Alone
Who's watching
Who's watching

[Andrew:]
Laid low in totality
Weakened
Fragile
The airbags didn't work
What the fuck is going on
Run away
The jaws open wider
Nobody is coming to help
The door's locked
The car's on fire
