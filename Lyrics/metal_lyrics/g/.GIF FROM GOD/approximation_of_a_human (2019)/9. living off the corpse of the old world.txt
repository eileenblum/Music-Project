[Mitchie:]
A rehearsed monologue
A mirroring tongue
Convictions ending in ellipses
An actor or accomplice?

Soon you will forget that there are guns to peoples heads
Soon you will forget the starving stomachs when you are well fed

You're an actor and you see my plight's your stage
You're just a coward searching for a spotlight
You cared enough just to pose for the camera
So go stand with the pigs you fuck
I bet tomorrow you will call them on your neighbors
Decrepit architecture forms the subject systemic decay unavoidable: planned
Machine learning mechanical being
Infertile, ineffable
Override revision
In my dreams I felt the warmth of the sun as it bleached my bones
