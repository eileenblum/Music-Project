[Mitchie:]
A critique in infamy circles
"In theory" looks different here than there
The nihilist knows and it shows and he called it art
A malice veiled truth, naivety's hidden counterpart
Academia is a scam, a sham shaped leviathan
Million dollar words, fifteen cent ideas
Argument for arguments sake is a snake
Choking an already beat to shit notion that your opinion matters even in the slightest
Yeah maybe these efforts will come and go with little consequence, but make no mistake
I would rather die miserable and fighting than a smug smile having done nothing
I'm miserably anyway
Do us all a favor and let this one go

[Andrew:]
Motherfuckee Greed inconceivable
Cellular rejection imminent
Eternal decay fundamental
How much is left for you to take
Apocalypse birthright
A decapitated head
Buried in black sand
Orhanic decimation
Technocratix domination
Will you give me new lugs
When all air is gone
Analog torment
Digital world
