[Mitchie:]
These cityscapes
Bare a resemblance to our skeletal bodies
Wandering through an empty rib cage
Our predecessors called home
I called it home too
Only now do I understand that we were already dead
This whole time I have been walking through a fucking graveyard
These towers and buildings
Will forever stand in ruin
Marking the face of the planet
With the scars of it's inhabitants
These neighbourhoods
These cities
These streets
We are but ghosts
Wandering empty halls
Clinging to life for the sake of survival

[Andrew:]
Beta burns usher in the new era
Desquamation of your body and home
Ionizing our way ti the future, a future of our own
One by one they all succumb
To what we've created
Carving new paths
Through the surface, through the trash
Before the end of oceans
Before the end of thylacine
