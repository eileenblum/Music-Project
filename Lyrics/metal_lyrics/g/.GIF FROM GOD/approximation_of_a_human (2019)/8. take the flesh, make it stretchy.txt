[Mitchie:]
Such shit
Stratifying strategy
Epitomize the persona of suffering
And sell it for all you can
I ate it all up, every fucking word
And now you think
A wall of walking corpses will make you a star
And the endless roar of emptiness starts to sound a lot like applause
All the boys look the same
All the boys forget my name
You found the look but lost the message

Oh god praxis
Yeah theirs a weight to it
It has a ring to it
It fucking hurts me
Yeah yeah
When I no longer can believe that you will stand up for me
Or that you ever would have
It hurts to know that all my favourite songs really meant nothing at all

[Andrew:]
Algorithmic survival engine
Blood shed on hollow circuitry
Doesn't matter who's
The machine speaks death
One ten one five one three one
Hyperbolix matter resolution
My sacrifice
Flesh laid on the alter
God help me
The machine speaks death
Cables in my mouth spasm
Short verge on locus obsolescence achieved
I will lie in the waste I created
The machine speaks my once name
