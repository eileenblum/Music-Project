[Mitchie:]
Spilled my secrets down a rabbit hole
I can't see anything. So I just...
Slept for a week no fun still weak from this fuck up
It's really... I usually walk the same way home, but not today
No, no this place will do the trick
Pose like snow angels in the summer
Yes we... we could make this work
You asked if I'd like to listen
The call beckons a returning favor
And I think it's my fault
Exchange my blood for a simple trade made in the name of escape.
Convenient albeit it's been going on for too long
You lose a bit of yourself when you're a liar.
