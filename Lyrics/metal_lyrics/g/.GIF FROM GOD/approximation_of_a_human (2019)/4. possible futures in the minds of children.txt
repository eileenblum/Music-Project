[Mitchie:]
With each thoughtless step the floor sings a quiet reminder
A weight to carry
The floor sings a quiet reminder

Scratch and scrape at the illusive surface
A grief stricken anatomy resides below
It's cities and streets have been choked
By clouds of black ash and smoke
The trade has been made and we will burn for sure
We will burn for sure
The crackling of splintering wood echoes across the leveled earth
As you ventured about for forgiveness
Merciless depletion. Carnivorous consumption
And still your pursuits seek absolution void solutions
Commodified conservation, posthumous restitution.

Remember with each thoughtless step you ruined the world.

Shame on you.
You labeled lives as living units of production.
You're a living unit of destruction.
Now all you have consumed grins as the earth's cavernous jaws open to take you back.
You will die unseen in a ritual of healing

[Andrew:]
There's a roof over all our heads
And it's slowly caving in
There's a cop behind my shoulder
Watching what I do
A car crash mindset
A straw house waiting for a hurricane an itch you'll never scratch. A wall you'll never climb
A whisper in your ear that never goes away
A dream that you will never ever ever wake from
Lying on a bed made of glass
Myopic ans miserable the loneliness will grow
The roof will just collapse and it only gets worse from there
The only light I see now is the glow of a screen
The promise of a world that I can't touch, can't feel, can't see
inconsequential epheral digital
