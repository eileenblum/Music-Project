[Mitchie:]
Woeful sights under wicked lights
Nurture a life in common
You said our love is to leave
Our love is to me
Elevated on on broken backs and fingernails
Where we have been
Nothing is meant, everything is and I know there is more
A collective breath, death I wouldn't know but look up.
Look past it's shadow.
I hope we make it out alive
But I admit
Clawing at its edges together would wholly suffice
A commitment to a dying wish persists
But still...
I would love to see the sun with you

No vitals. No pulse. No way out. I have seen the earth choke. World demise revealed. Acceleration principle. Flesh construction.
Consummate, deathless..There is only one. One self. One ten one nine one seven one six one five one four one three one two one. Sun poison.
Sickening. Heat death. Die burning. No choice. No birthright. No will. Only one remains.
