[Mitchie:]
Hail storm of eyes, rain down to find a place to reside in the places
I hide.
So much for a moment.
A space to breathe.
It's a lasting complication or it is for now at least.
Dial in just the right frequency, take those liberties.
Ears bleeding.
It's hard to admit that without this nothing feels worth while.
It's got me freaked.

[Andrew:]
No way but forward in isolation
Running, crawling, screaming
Don't look behind you
There is a presence imperceptible
Time lost meaning
No car
No desk
No 911
What will you do when your teeth fall out?
Left with gums and nail
A lackluster prey drive
Hungry
Hurting
Help help help
There was never a plan b
Just a flash drive and a scalpel
Why is it so hard to admit that, without this nothing feels worthwhile.
It's got me freaked
