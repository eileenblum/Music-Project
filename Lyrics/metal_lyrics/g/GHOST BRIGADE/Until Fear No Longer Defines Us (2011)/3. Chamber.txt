Oh how long is the day
I can't stand this light
I want to travel through darkness
There's nothing to see anymore
The last touch of your cold skin
Both gentle and painful
A silent whisper tells me to leave

No longer needed
Denied feelings
For the rest of your life
You live in fear
This is not our path
It wasn't made for us

This endless time feels like a prison
Bars made of memories and walls made of cries
Drinking the tears and eating the souls
We're all doing time and that time ain't ours
We're all doing time and that time ain't ours
I am drinking the tears away

Can't feel the ground
It's not the same
Everything changes
I hate your face
I want the ground to take me and swallow me whole
I want the ground to save me and hide my soul
If you want to disappear, please follow me

This endless time feels like a prison
Bars made of memories and walls made of cries
Drinking the tears and eating the souls
This endless time feels like a prison
Bars made of memories and walls made of cries
Drinking the tears and eating the souls
We're all doing time and that time ain't ours
We're all doing time and that time ain't ours
I am drinking the tears away and eating the souls
We are losing our souls again

If you want to disappear, please follow me
