Now, I'm still here to love you
But I need you to be ready
One day you have to carry me
And lay me down to the hole
It's a shame I'm not the light you need
When you feel lost in the dark
It's a shame you can not follow me
When I need to be understood

I am not the one to tell the truth
Not the one to tell a lie
Is this the heaven I knew or just another hell
Hear the storm rising again
And I'm just a grain of sand

Storm is fading away
Leaving dust flowing in the air
Watching the view still unknown
Can not remember this place
Feel your hand in mine
Or is it just a feeling
How deep have I fallen this time
Can I still climb back

I'm not the one to tell the truth
Not the one to tell a lie
Is this the heaven I knew or just another hell
Hear the storm rising again
And I'm just a grain of sand

Feel the storm rising again
I can hear it inside my head
Again I had to let you go
But remember what I said
I needed this time for myself
To find out what went wrong
Even though the years have gone by
I still don't know you

I'm not the one to tell the truth
Not the one to tell a lie
Is this the heaven I knew or just another hell
I'm not the one to tell the truth
Not the one to tell a lie
Is this the heaven I knew or just another hell
Hear the storm rising again
And I'm just a grain of sand
