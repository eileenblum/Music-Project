Watch as the white ocean waves hit the shore
and purge your soul of all burden and routine
There's an open fire inside me
Come look closer and embrace it

Under those lights I felt safe
Closer to home than ever before
If only I could've seen further
But the blood we carry isn't always red enough

Crossed the bridge, to modify the incomplete
One more time - lose, reclaim, conceal &amp; repeat
In a storm, hidden from the beasts of prey
One last time - lose, reclaim, conceal &amp; repeat

And here I lie in my room
Where everything is nothing and nothing is everything
For some, the more things change the more they stay the same
22:22  Nihil.
