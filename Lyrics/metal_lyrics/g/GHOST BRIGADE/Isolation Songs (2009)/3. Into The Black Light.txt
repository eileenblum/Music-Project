Surrounded by leaders
We are the dregs of life
Do not panic, leave no trace
Pretend to not care
Do you ever dream about making a difference
Do you ever dream about making a difference

I have waited all my life
for someone to get me out of here
I never knew the view from the edge
of the world would look like this

Our thoughts beaten senseless
Collecting compassionate stares
Blind to the world in front of us
Deaf to your own will
Surrounded by deceivers
Come reap the harvest with me
Break hearts just to feed the anger
The anger that used to be love

I have waited all my life
for someone to get me out of here
I never knew the view from the edge
of the world would look like this

I have waited all my life
for someone to get me out of here
I never knew the view from the edge
of the world would look like this

From the shadows - Into the black light
