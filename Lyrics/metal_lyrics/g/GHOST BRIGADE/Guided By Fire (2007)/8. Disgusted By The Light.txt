They're gonna grill the truth out of you
Compression for everyone
It's not a miracle how you break
Seeing the signs of declining
No one is going to help you out
It's like the breeding horses

You told me how you've been, been waiting

Always praising final hours
Like the time was never right
Able to sense the rising light
Yet still feels I'm sinking
Never beared no resemblance
Against any living soul

You told me how you've been, been waiting

Surrounding cold makes me smile
I saw the animal in you, raise skies
Surrounding cold makes me smile
I saw the animal in you raise skies, the time is now

The light is with me, the rest of me is gone
Need no help to save myself
This is my hell, go find your own one
This is my hell, go find your own one

You will fail, you will see
You will see the difference
