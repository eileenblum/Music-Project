How sick you ever wanna be
Able to see the light
Suffer boy leash won't break
How hard you try

Helplessly tilt the time for me
Can you help this only for me

Walls around you grow taller
Hard to keep em [?]
Heaven beside you bargain [?] with [?]
Buy yourself your own kingdom

Helplessly tilt the time for me
Can you help this only for me
First to find [?]
It's hard to be [?]

Lightning [?] for [?]
Lack of regret wakes me [?]
