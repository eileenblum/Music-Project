Feel it rush in your brain
Like lightning breaks the sky
Stand alone and die raising arms

Wishing you could stop
Wishing you could stop
Wishing you could stop
Wishing

I bet you ain't never ended
Your day way like this
I bet you ain't never ended
Your day way like this

Cabin fever - raising voice
Cabin fever - raising voice

Cast down my name with your only way
Cast down my name with your only way

Look at my way, look now your way
Stay focused, stay awake
Getting it all with a
Get it in order
Get it in order
I, I wanna blow you away

We keep it still, we keep it steady
Calming us down, making us slaves

Cabin fever - raging voice
Cabin fever - raising voice

Second time we were hanging lower
Counting seconds but it won't work

Look at my way, look now your way
Stay focused, stay awake
Getting it all with a
Get it in order
Get it in order
I, I wanna blow you away

Getting tired, I wanna know
Better days await

Better days await...
