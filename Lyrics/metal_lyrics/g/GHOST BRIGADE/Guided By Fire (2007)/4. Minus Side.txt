Taking life for itself
You call yourself a man
Declare it as a sin
Who are you to judge
Can't stand alone behind your own words

We made you as a coward
We blame you, you loser
We name you as a coward
So you deserve to fly away

We have seen so many fail
Trying to change people for better
Evolved to minus side
And the number is growing

Maybe the end of war
It could clear us all
Maybe the end of all
And another day would be dark

So many gave their lives for serving god
Stopped so late or stayed in the dark

I believe in this simple world
I believe in you
To choose your side the day you born

Unlike the unborn
That's your only salvation
Think you're feeling better
The full circle has done

Maybe the end of war
It shall deem us all
Maybe the end of all
And another day would be gone

So many gave their lives for serving god
Stopped so late or stayed in the dark

I believe in this simple world
I believe in the spoken word
I believe in this simple world
I believe in you
