Who's there to lie to for a little more
Got so evil, how could this happen
Living shell of a human, I can't trust you
Pain is much more than I could ever be

Made your mind
Inner source saw a place to exceed god
Why need god
What's safe to see we let the eyes
I can see no god
What you create, what you make

So you are a human with no one
Show me the ways how you make everything shine
I'll make you walk through fire and desire
Let hell be loose, everything that I ever wanted

Made your mind
Inner source saw a place to exceed god
Why need god
What's safe to see we let the eyes
I can see no god (What you create, what you make)
Turn away

Lack of trust
Helpless deep within to someone
Stop crying
Say something what is real
This time your god won't help you
