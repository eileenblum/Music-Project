Crawling ditches
Searching for early days
Look at this world
It says clearly not for you

[?]
It's not for pretty eyes
You gonna take it
It's pointing straight at you

How alone you must be
That you can't really feel
Hopes of freedom you can't get out of head, you
In this day lay standing in a crowd
Screaming, screaming

Reading wishes about lies, diseases
It's making me feel sick and poor
'Cause you gotta go, you gotta move
You gotta have lot of goals
Don't you ever lose this [?]

How alone you must be
That you can't really feel
Hopes of freedom you can't get out of head, you
In this day lay standing in a crowd
Screaming, screaming

The wishes won't go any further
[?]

How alone you must be
That you can't really feel
Hopes of freedom you can't get out of head, you
In this day lay standing in a crowd
Screaming, screaming
