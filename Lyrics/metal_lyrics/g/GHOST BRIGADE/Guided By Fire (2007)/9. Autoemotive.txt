You're living in a lie
I learned it from you
All the shit took a twisted turn
I'm tired of running
Living in a pile of crap
And following you
Learn how to judge and control
Learn how to keep the smile forgotten

Kept myself awake, revenge
I got it in the end
And what I got, I got nothing, revenge
It all turned against me
It all turned against me

Keeping up the straight look
Just waiting the pulse
Push myself away from you
Take you on everything
'Cause you threw me over the line
I myself couldn't prolong shit
I'm just waiting and wanting

Kept myself awake, revenge
I got it in the end
And what I got, I got nothing, revenge
It all turned against me
