Show no mercy to anyone
Thought that all nauseous is past
It's all coming back
Stronger than ever
Blood in your veins belongs to me
Ain't going to reckon you to be my voice
Not the one to speak for me
Some day flames will reach up there

Blames and accuses through times
Reveals some serious problems
Times of agony and pain I feel so dead
Blames and accuses through times
Reveals some serious problems
Times of chaos and pain

We're gonna drag you down with us
Help you open your own eyes
And help you see
This is for your heart
The note you left behind
Wasn't only owned for me
It was owned for everyone
This growing disease called need

Blames and accuses through times
Reveals some serious problems
Times of agony and pain I feel so dead
Blames and accuses through times
Reveals some serious problems
Times of chaos and pain
