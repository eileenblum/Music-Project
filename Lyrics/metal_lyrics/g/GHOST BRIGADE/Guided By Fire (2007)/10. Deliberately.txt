Got a point of the lost
Realise the damage done
But I won't back down this time
Losing everything that I've ever had

Yet another day lays done
This promise fail in my name
Yet another day you're gone
Lie to yourself one more time

My crooked heart will be slaved
But still I won't back down
Scream your lungs out
For easen the pain inside

Yet another day lays done
This promise fail in my name
Yet another day you're gone
Lie to yourself one more time

Will this never be over
Don't be afraid if your heart is colder

Will this never be over
Don't be afraid if your heart miss

My bleeding heart gone for good
I feel so tired I'm heading home
