In your dead city
There was never enough light for all of us
In your dead city
The absence of it's soul made me want to leave
Into the unknown
Feel the fever piercing through your mind
Into the unknown
This is the last time you will ever see me burn

Let me drown to light with my ghosts
Let me drown to light with my ghosts

Only a few miles from home now
A rousing fire in my eyes
Closer to salvation
Free from the weight of you

Let me drown to light with my ghosts
Let me drown to light with my ghosts
Let me drown to light with my ghosts
Let me drown to light

Innocent lies
A love that never dies
Will you catch me when I fall
Crimson eyes
A light that never blinds
Promised to fight
Till I meet myself again
Innocent lies
A love that never dies
Will you catch me when I fall
Crimson eyes
A light that never blinds
Promised to fight
Till I meet myself again

Can't remember what it felt like the last time I left.
Unable to compromise
Can't remember what it felt like the last time I left
Unable to compromise

Seal my mouth
All screams quieted down
Seal my mouth and feel the fever rising

Innocent lies
A love that never dies
Will you catch me when I fall
Crimson eyes
A light that never blinds
Promised to fight
Till I meet myself again
Till I meet myself again
Till I meet myself again
