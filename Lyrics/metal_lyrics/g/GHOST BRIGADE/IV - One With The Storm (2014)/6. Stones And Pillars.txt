Crawl my way through growl and crust
The hardest job I've ever had
Your heart is heavy but so is mine
As I swore to you once you're never gonna walk alone

Placing this image of a man
In between stones and pillars
Deep in the shadows
Armed and protected from curious eyes

I'll keep walking till my feet give out
Any my veins are dry like that wishing well
I still have purpose
One task to do
It's like wandering without a compass
But I'm still searching for you

Misery
It is our curse
Desperation
Feels like drowning in shallow waters
In between stones and pillars

Found some burned wood and six rusty nails
Somehow I knew exactly what I'm supposed to do
Building this monument for us to remember
What was it like when there was peace

Misery
It is our curse
Desperation
Feels like drowning in shallow waters
Misery
It is our curse
Desperation
