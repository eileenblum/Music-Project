When everything is said and done. And there's finally some time to breathe. You are overwhelmed by the calm. Senses focused for the one and only you love. I keep you safe at any cost. You must keep moving on until everything is lost. There's nothing that could break us apart. No sudden moves to shake your ground. There's no one who could make you complete. You've got a long way to the graves. One lie could tear us apart. And one look could change everything. Even your heart. Fragile life can be lost in a flash. You have grieved enough. You have to stand up. There's nothing that could break us apart. No sudden moves to shake your ground. There's no one who could make you complete. You've got a long way to the graves.
