Slowly blinking light
Calls you home
Where your bloodline began
And where the meadows bathe in a cold morning sun

No place like other
It's so easy to breathe

And you felt the closeness of her
Yet you knew she was long gone
Tied your eyes
And the light won't hurt you
And kept the secret deep inside

Waiting for a closure
There is no remorse in your eyes
Only anger can keep you alive
And memories of a view from the past

No such thing as you are
Unique creation from the heart

And I felt the closeness of you
But I knew you were gone
Tied my eyes that the light wouldn't hurt me
And carried the secret inside

You tasted the venom
And felt the teeth and claws
Bared more than anyone dares
Swayed between real and unreal

You tasted the venom
And felt the wipe and chains
Bared more than anyone
Swayed between real and unreal

I fared open your mother's rib cage
Took out her beating heart
Looked deep into her dying eyes and asked
Was I ever worth of this?

Freak of nature

You tasted the venom
And felt the teeth and claws
Bared more than anyone dares
Swayed between real and unreal

Now you're here to show us why
A broken heritage should never be shown
Now you are here to tell the secret
Why some things should never be born

Tear open your mother's rib cage
Took out all her love
Looked deep into her dying eyes and asked
Is this my price?

Freak of nature
