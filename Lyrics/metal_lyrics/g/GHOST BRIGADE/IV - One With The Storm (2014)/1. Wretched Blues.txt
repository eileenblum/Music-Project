Walking slowly.
Distilled blood designed to never fail.
Sedate and pure. Cold by choice.
Stylized pain.
I am feeling blue.
Lacerated and swallowed down below.
I was fearless but now I'm screaming scared in nothingness. In this emptiness.
So I let this void to fill up my heart

Of fire and endless resistance.
Where shadows bit like flames.
They sing of fire and endless resistance.
Where echoes call your name.

Medicated and ready.
To accept life.
As it comes and as it ends.
Expectations.
And the highest of hopes.
You're supposed to be happy. When everything around us is alive and green.

Of fire and endless resistance.
Where shadows call your name.
Of fire and endless resistance.
Where echoes bite like flames.

Forevermore.
Hollow men on hollow ground.
Crushed bones and bruising souls.
Multiple substance abusers.
