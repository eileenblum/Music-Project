Try to stand up
Can't feel your feet
Trying to survive
You have no will to live
You want to get out
Walk through that door
Too weak to seek for help
But you know you have to try

Just one more time

Waiting for the end
Or a change direction.
'Cause you know you are ready to take everything you get
You get nothing done
Emotionally broken
You feel sick
When you find out that your best friend is a liar
Like we all are

This is not the first time
When I'm in this condition
And it's not the last time when I promise to change everything
Another year
Another wasted season
A decent boy holds the line alone
Another day
Another wasted hour
I'm standing on the edge of open grave
Let the shovel sing

Squeeze all the anger into a box
Seal it tight and bury it deep
Squash all your wisdom and light up the skies
Rub the blade till your fingers bleed
They preach about family and love
Yet in the end nothing's sacred
Halos are fading

This is not the last time when I'm bound to take the step
And it's not the first time when I promise everything
This is not the first time
When I'm in this condition
And it's not the last time when I promise to change everything
Another round
Another empty bottle
That same boy tries to be a man
Another prayer
Another pointless promise
I'm standing on the edge of open grave
Let the shovel sing.

Spilling lies upon your father's grave
Let the shovel sing
Let the shovel sing
