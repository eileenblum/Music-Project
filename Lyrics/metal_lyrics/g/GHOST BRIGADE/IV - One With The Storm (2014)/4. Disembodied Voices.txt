A fiery rain is keeping me awake.
With every drop killing another promise.
Mind's drifting in nothingness.
Life in circles.
And I know that not so long from now.
Hope will conquer all.

They said time heals.
In a year or so you'll be alright.
Time doesn't heal.
It only makes you forget.
Mind's drifting in nothingness.
Life in circles.
And I know that not so long from now.
Hope will conquer all.

Tomorrow's a way out.
From all of my graves.
Tomorrow's a way out.
From all of this.
From all of my graves.

With a thousand snakes at my feet I rise.
With death in my eyes.
Run with the speed of light.
Until hope conquers all.

A fiery rain keeping me awake.
With every drop killing another promise.
