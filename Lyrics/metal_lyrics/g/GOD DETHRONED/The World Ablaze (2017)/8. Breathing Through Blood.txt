Frozen stiff I lie on the ground
My mouth is dry, I'm bleeding out
I wait for help, but they won't come
There's snipers all around

Breathing through blood
As I die here in a pool of mud

Abandon hope, it is too late
I'll die here now, it is my fate
Our campaign, it failed completely
A wretched cause, all misery

Stabbed in my chest
Schrapnel wounds
My legs are gone
I'm going blind
I feel the pain
I'm so cold
My life force is slipping away

Breathing through blood
As I die here in a pool of mud

Frozen stiff I lie on the ground
My mouth is dry, I'm bleeding out
I wait for help, but they won't come
There's snipers all around
