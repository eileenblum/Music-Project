In Blind fury
We climb over the edge
Across no man's land
Deliver the final blow

Charge! Take no prisoners
Merciless. We take no prisoners

Close to victory
Force them to their knees
Knock them off their feet
We're close to victory

Mount your bajonet
We know no mercy
At point blank range
We shoot to kill

In Blind fury
We climb over the edge
Across no man's land
Deliver the final blow

Charge! Take no prisoners
Merciless. We take no prisoners

Close to victory

Mount your bajonet
We know no mercy
At point blank range
We shoot to kill

Close to victory
Force them to their knees
Knock them off their feet
We're close to victory
