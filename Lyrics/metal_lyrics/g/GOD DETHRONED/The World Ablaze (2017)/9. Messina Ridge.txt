Break through the stalemate
Capture defenses on the ridge
Devastate front line defences
Assemble the troops in
No man's land

Fire a creeping barrage
To support the infantry advance
Outflank strong points and
Machine gun nests
Repulse another attack

Detonate the mines
Beneath their front lines
Pillars of fire
Vanished an entire army

Messina ridge

The creeping bombardment threw
Up smoke and dust
Blocking the view of the defenders
The forward zone was overrun
Anticipate a counter attack

Detonate the mines
Beneath their front lines
Pillars of fire
Vanished an entire army

Messina ridge
