Retreat denied
The army's set in forward motion
Taking lives for king and country
Our battles gloryfied

Annihilation crusade

Bloodthirst reigns the battlefield
Pincer movements make it real
Victory for us to take
Decimating forces

Annihilation crusade

Dominate in infamy
Death defying lunacy
Our spirits can't be broken

Barrage fire is unleashed
Pounding the enemy
Their spirit has been broken

Retreat denied
The army's set in forward motion
Taking lives for king and country
Our battles gloryfied

Annihilation crusade
