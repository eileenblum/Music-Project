Fight for your country
Fight to stay alive
This trench feels like a prison cell
Stuck in mud and blood

A wasteland full of human debris
Shells are raining down on us
The World is ablaze

Relentless bombardments
Pounding the front line
The World is ablaze

Storming through no man`s land
20.000 down. Crushed by the enemy
Our captain just got shot

No peaceful death in this
wretched place
God forsaken
The war is lost
The world ablaze
