Nicholas of Romanov
Forced to abolish the throne
The white guard we are
Loyal to the crown of the tsar
The white army

The communists took control
Over Russia
Cossacks and volunteers fought
Against the red plague

The white army

Our stronghold in the north
Overrun by the red guard
Against the odds escape
Across the ice
Oh mother Russia we march
Day and night

Hardened by the ordeal of
The ice march
Remnants of a fallen realm
We fight back
We're cossacks rising

Escape across the ice
