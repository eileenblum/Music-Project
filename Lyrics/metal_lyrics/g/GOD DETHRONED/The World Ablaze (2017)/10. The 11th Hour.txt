Defeat a defeated army
Whatever the cost
Cessation of hostilities
Paid for in blood

The night was frigid
Shrouded in drizzle and fog
As the marines tried to find their
Way in the gloom
Nothing was visible but the flash
Of enemy guns
Pierced with bullets they dropped
To the ground

After four long years
The end is near
A war of attrition
The war to end all wars

Defeat a defeated army
Whatever the cost
Cessation of hostilities
Paid for in blood
On the 11th hour of the 11th day
Of the 11th month
Peace was signed that day

After four long years
The end is near
A war of attrition
The war to end all wars
