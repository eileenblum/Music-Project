Deep inside enemy territory
Far beyond the front line
Hold your ground, no retreat
Outnumbered ten to one
Another attack with no effect
Impossible to break through
Stormtroopers break our might
On the wrong side of the wire

Another life is lost
Buried in a nameless grave
Another body maimed
Praying for a swift ending

On the wrong side of the wire

Surrounded by the enemy
We hold our ground
Impossible to reach the lines
We hold our ground
