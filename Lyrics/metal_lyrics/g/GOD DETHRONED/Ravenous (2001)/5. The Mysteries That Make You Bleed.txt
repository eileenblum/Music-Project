Some mysteries will make you bleed
While other steal your sanity
Some eat out life, slowly, rapidly
And in us it all combines

Maybe your soul projects the purest of darkness
Some mysteries will make you bleed
While others steal your sanity

I'm in your head, stirring up your soul
You're messed up well
I'll entertain you in my hell

I'll ravage and rape your soul
Pillage and plunder your mind
Stricken and shredded to pieces
But living i'll leave you behind

Pray, prey
Pray for a shadow where i can't find you
Pray, prey
Pray, for in hell there's nowhere to run to

I'll ravage and rape your soul
Pillage and plunder your mind
Stricken and shredded to pieces
But living i'll leave you behind

Pray, prey, pray
Pray for a shadow where i can't find you
Pray, prey, pray
Pray, for in hell there's nowhere to run to

I'm the demon in your head
Your soul is my domain
Let's play the game again
Hide and seek in hell

I'll ravage and rape your soul
Pillage and plunder your mind
Stricken and shredded to pieces
But dead i'll leave you behind
