Scum of the earth
Winged vermin of the night
Sharpened teeth, poisoned blood
Madness is running through my veins
The taste of blood it feeds my soul
Feels so good i kill unbound
You're gonna give it all to me

I want your blood
I want it now

A killer divine searching for blood
Sucking you dry i'm devoured by your blood

Villa vampiria

You ran into me
In the final hours of the night
Two black holes in your neck
In this empty street i killed you swift and quick
Emotionless a heart of stone
I'm dead inside i kill unbound
They die with horror in their eyes

I want your blood
I want it now

A killer divine searching for blood
Sucking you dry i'm devoured by your blood

Villa vampiria

Welcome to my house
I like bathing in blood
Your body cut open
I like bathing in blood

I want your blood
I want it now

A killer divine searching for blood
Sucking you dry i'm devoured by your blood

Villa vampiria
