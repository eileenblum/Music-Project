Another christhunt
A broken crucifix
And with the blood of christ
I quenched my thirst

An image of christ
Trampled to a thousand pieces
Between the shattered statue of the holy virgin
A crucifix plunged into the holy shrine
And with the blood of christ
I quenched my thirst

Another christhunt
A broken crucifix
And with the blood of christ
I quenched my thirst

I am the iconoclast
Born from the womb of the whore
The whore of babylon
With endless rage i came
I came to ruin the treasures to the church so precious
I'm the antichrist
And on i ride into the night

Another christhunt
A broken crucifix
And with the blood of christ
I quenched my thirst

On flames of fury i scourge the christian realm
Within my trail the hounds of hell

Another christhunt
A broken crucifix
And with the blood of christ
I quenched my thirst
