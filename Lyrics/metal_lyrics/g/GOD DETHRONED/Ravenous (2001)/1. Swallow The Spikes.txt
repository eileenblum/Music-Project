Have you ever sinned yourself oh reverend
Pointing your finger at the masses
Paying retribution for all shit gone wrong
Have you ever sinned yourself oh reverend

We'll cut off a finger
For every sin you've comitted
We'll cut off an ear
For every lie we hear
We'll cut out your tongue
Swallow the spikes
Your stiff corpse
Will be fed to the worms

How many times
Have you betrayed
Christ and your god
Whatever his name
They've left you now
Left to die
It makes no difference
You're dead now

(swallow the spikes)
Enjoy your last supper
We'll cut out your tongue
We'll make you swallow the spikes
Till your stuffed and done
