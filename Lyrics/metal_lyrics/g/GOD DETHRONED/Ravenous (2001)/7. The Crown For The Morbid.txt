Hear me
I am the crown for the morbid
The fire in the eyes of the rabid
I am the hate inside the psychotic
And the fear consuming the phobic

I seek to overthrow you
With the powers given to me
By your own weak mind
That turned on you today

I am the worst of intentions
That dwells inside you all
I am the instinct never mentioned
That makes humanity fall

I am the swine devouring pearls
Right before your coward eyes
I am the venom that consumes you
The serpent in your paradise

I am the reason why
The innocent are slaughtered
I am the laughing lie
That's never uncovered

The unsilencable cry
To kill your beloved
I am like death inside you
And i loathe you all

I'm the multiple in personality
The sickness that is eating you
In your sane psychotic episodes
I'm the voice that speaks to you

Only you will know
I am as real as can be
I'm the final words you'll read
I'll be the end of your story
