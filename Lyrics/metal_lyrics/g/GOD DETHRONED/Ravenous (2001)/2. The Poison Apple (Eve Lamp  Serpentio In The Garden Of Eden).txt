Oh eve, do you like my snakeskin suit?
Oh eve touch my skin it feels so smooth

Oh eve, i've seen you naked in the garden of eden
Eve come with me to the tree of ancient wisdom
Eve don't fear me
I'm just a serpent and i like forbidden fruit

Eve take a bite (fear not)
Eve you're a god (the poison apple)
Eve you're divine (you're a god)
You won't fall from grace (the poison apple)
Forbidden fruit (oh eve) it's so good for you (the poison apple)

Oh eve, don't let adam rule over you
Eve, i'll need you more than he'll ever do
Please multiply my seed as the stars of heaven and the sand on the seashore

I'm crawling all over you
I wanna taste your forbidden fruit
I'll take you to heaven now

Oh eve, do you like my snakeskin suit?
Oh eve touch my skin it feels so smooth

I'm crawling all over you
I wanna taste your forbidden fruit
I'll take you to heaven now

Oh eve, i've seen you naked in the garden of eden
Eve come with me to the tree of ancient wisdom
Eve don't fear me
I'm just a serpent and i like forbidden fruit

The poison apple
