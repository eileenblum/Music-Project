Lord of foulness swallow me
Intro your morbid world of darkness
Sickening harp rasps accompany
My voyage of damnation

Unchain the soul
From decaying corpse
For the majesty, to corrode

Trying to still
His endless thirst
Breath is grasped away
Feeding the altar flame

Chopped in half, you bleed
Your will to live faints away
Forfilled with darkness, seek the gates
Internal rot, cosumed by worms

Suffocate in your own blood
Arterial bleeding
Mutilation from within
Bacterial raids

Trying to still
His endless thirst
Breath is grasped away
Feeding the altar flame

Oh world invisible, we can touch thee
Oh world intangible, we can touch thee

Oh world invisible, we can touch thee
Oh world intangible, we can touch thee

Suffocate in your own blood
Arterial bleeding
Mutilation from within
Bacterial raids
