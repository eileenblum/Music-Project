Invincible, high upon her throne
All her powers will be show
Insame manoeuvres of her mind
Rites complete, destruction of mankind

Born from the womb of chaos
She rules the unborn human-race
From a place where no life dwells
Sister of darkness, whore from hell

Thirsty for the childrens blood
Owl and hellbounds by her side
As the blood drips from her lips
Even the brave fear this malicious sight

Magic staff and torch in hand
Black book, ancient runes, witches chant
Sworn enemies of the world anew
Bat's blood and left eye, witches brew

Born from the womb of chaos
She rules the unborn human-race
From a place where no life dwells
Sister of darkness, whore from hell

Magic staff and torch in hand
Black book, ancient runes, witches chant
Sworn enemies of the world anew
Bat's blood and left eye, witches brew

Born from the womb of chaos
She rules the unborn human-race
From a place where no life dwells
Sister of darkness, whore from hell
