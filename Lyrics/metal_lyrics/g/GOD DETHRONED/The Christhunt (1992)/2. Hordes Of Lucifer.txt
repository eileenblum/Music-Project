Sinister fields
Summon the weak
Blinding their eyes
Grinding the opposition

Untamble hate
Causing death
Forks of fire
Ripping the sight of tiranny

Satan
Master iver mortal christ
Still having the upper hand
Lucifer

After thousands of years
Loosed from his prison
Silhouettes of gallows rise at the horizon
The sign of his return
The chosen ones jerk in the tight noose
See the fury in his eyes
Prince of darkness lead me the way
The plath leads towards hell
The stench of corroded souls fills the air
Lost inside the endless halls
Inside the cathedral of abomination
Paintings show the horror of terror
Terror of god's greed

Commanding the dogs
To cleanse the land
Lords of sickness
You will remember my name

The courtroom of lies
Is rotting away
Flames consume
The book of distorted reality

Satan
Master over mortal christ
Still having the upper hand
Lucifer

When the last sparks of light are absorbed in the night
Witches streak the skies
Feasting till dawn then disappear out of sight
The gates of thy kingdom will open
Enter the realms of chaos
Follow the hordes of lucifer

Sinister fields
Summon the weak
Blinding their eyes
Grinding the opposition

The courtroom of lies
Is rotting away
Flames consume
The book of distorted reality
