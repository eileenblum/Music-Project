Visions harass my life
Drowning all christian rats
Chaos opressing religion
God finally lost his throne

Fall of christ, their grip fainting away
Disbelievers escape their tiranny
Ripping throats of all their enslavers
Paradise in total desolation

Set thou an unholy man
To be ruler over him
And let satan stand
At his right hand
God dethroned

Priest kneel for reprieve
Death is all they recieve
Life slipping out of their bodies
Lucifer finally in command

Set thou an unholy man
To be ruler over him
And let satan stand
At his right hand
God dethroned

Monks die, a bloody death
Churches burn
Apocalypse, no escape
Satanic raids
Your god is dead

Set thou an unholy man
To be ruler over him
And let satan stand
At his right hand
God dethroned
