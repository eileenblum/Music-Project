When the sunlight breaks the dawn
The cross on which he's nailed drips with blood
His body is mangled, emaciated
The downfall, the final defeat

The dark one is the night
Searching for a body of the dead
Smealling the air of passed life flesh
Formless body, limbs were scorched in the sun
Fornicate the holy, reaping the innocent dead

Aaaaarrggghh, questions irse when hours pass by
Who bestole the holy grave, morbid truth I search for thee
When the night falls in, the unknown travels from grave to
grave
Untamble bestial sin, blasphemy of the holy flesh

Infernal, sights: the lord of flies disgraced his grave
Bloody, dawn: facing evil was the fear of christ
Infernal, sights: Now his corpse is stolen by necrophiliac
Bloody, dawn: Death is more present than god ever can be
