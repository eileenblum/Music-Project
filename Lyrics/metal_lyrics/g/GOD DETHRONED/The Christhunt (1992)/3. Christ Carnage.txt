Strorming the gates of hell
Christ carnage
Warlords lead you the death
With a frenzy in their eyes
It's a chaos in your realm
You attack my world endlessly
But I'm crushing your skull and your neck
Die!!!

The messenger of death, he's fallen from the skies
The signs of terror, arrival of the lord of flies
Chopping like a mill, dismember the skull from your neck
Hacking around me, the earth is water'd with blood
The last holocaust, begins with the final attack
War, blood flows like a stream into the sea

Countless bodies
Cover the earth
Nocturnal wars
Balance the sign of the cross

Christ carnage christ carnage!!!!
