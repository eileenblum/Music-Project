Hear the lions roar the coloseum serenades
Their mighty growls make you think they didn't eat for a week
Running for your life but once you've caught his eye
then kiss your ass goodbye
You scream in anguish, but the audience favour the lion
Christianity, inferiority, food for the lions in the roman game

Nero's heroes

I bite off your legs
No, no, please God no
I'll grind your crispy bones and I rip your flesh
Our majesty's favourite game and death is the first prize
