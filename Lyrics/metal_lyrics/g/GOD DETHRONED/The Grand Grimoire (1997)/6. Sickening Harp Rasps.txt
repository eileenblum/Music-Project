When the night comes and you fall asleep
I'm always there to bring you the darkest nightmares
I can hear you scream, you're body is bathing in sweat
When the ghost inside you penetrates your mind

I would like to rape your soul
When you're unconcious and blind
Do you feel the fear
When my blood crawls through your veins

Sickening harp rasps and the choirs of damnation
tempt you to me
I whisper your name
I want to suck your blood and to rape your mind
'till your body is disappeared in the shadows of death

[lead - Jens]
[lead - Jens]

I would like to rape your soul
When you're unconcious and blind
Do you feel the fear
When my blood crawls through your veins

Eventually you go insane
Bearing no longer the pain
when you've cut your wrists
I flow out of your life
