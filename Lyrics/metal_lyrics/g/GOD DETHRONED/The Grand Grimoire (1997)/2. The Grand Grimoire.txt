I am here to unleash the Armageddon
Send by the dark one to extinguish the fire
When I find the grand grimoire, I crumble the earth
When God's creation is gone my master has won

666 I am the warlock and I bring you damnation
666 annihilation, abomination, immolation, extermination

I need the grand grimoire, I'll find The Grand Grimoire

Slave of darkness, help me to cleanse the earth
Bring me the book the mortal ones try to hide
Let satan's eyes guide you while you search
kill the disobedient, enslave the weak

This damned earth now burns, for I found The Grand Grimoire
Watch the bloodred sky turn black, fucking black
My mission is fulfilled, I silenced the world forever
When the mist is gone, there's darkness and the sight of
nothingness

666 I am the warlock and I bring you damnation
666 annihilation, abomination, immolation, extermination
