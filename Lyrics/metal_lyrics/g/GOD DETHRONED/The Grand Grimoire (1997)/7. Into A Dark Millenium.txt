When your soul is free to wander, where would it go?
Do you think it is safe with God in heaven?
But what if the angels took over his power and might
They could torment it ofr milleniums to come

Oh, angelface, who's side are you on

It's a war, the second war, and the heavens shall burn

You could be the victim of Gabriels jealousy
Escaping Lucifer and his hungry hellish flames
You mortal fool with your naive heavenly devotion
Your beloved guardian angel is now tightening the skrew

It's a war, the second war, and the heavens shall burn

[lead - Henri]

Oh, angelface, who's side are you on

Into a dark Millenium
