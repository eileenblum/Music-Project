Driving the masses
In narrow passages
Gassing them all into sleep

Waiting in line
Till a shock ends your life
Who is the beast in here

No daylight
Only on the day you die
Life imprisonment
Slaugtering the faithful

No daylight
Only on the day you die
Life imprisonment
Slaughtering the faithful

First a meaningless life
Then a meaningless death

A life of stress
Comes to a useless end

[Repeat all verses]

Out of the womb
Now meet your doom
Dayling you'll never see
Only on the day you die
