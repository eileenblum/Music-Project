Eyes watch you from a step away
A wide grin as I manipulate

In the dark of awareness
The arena of the blind
The hell you see is nearer than you think

I feed you new filth today
Open wide as I manipulate

In the dark of awareness
The arena of the blind
The hell you see is nearer than you think

As I wreck the dreams and hopes of countless eyes
And feed my filth to millions
Focussed on the addiction of wide screen lies
Fixed on the messages unseen

Unseen - Evolved - Machine - Subliminal

Unseen - Evolved - Machine - Subliminal

Now I've caught your attention
Fix your gaze on the information maze
Filter out my hidden agenda

As I wreck the dreams and hopes of countless eyes
And feed my filth to millions

Focussed on the addiction of wide screen lies
Fixed on the messages unseen

As I wreck the dreams and hopes of countless eyes
And feed my filth to millions
The world consumes in synchrony
Willing virus for my chaos remedy
