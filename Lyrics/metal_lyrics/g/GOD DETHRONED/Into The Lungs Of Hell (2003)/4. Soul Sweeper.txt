I am the great deceiver
I have caused so many wars
Those who opposed me
Never lived to tell

Soul Sweeper

I had my acts accepted
I had my will understood
I caused all the mindtrips
I manipulate
Now it will all be different
After so many years
The church is empty
All the magic's gone

Soul Sweeper

God is dead, your god is dead
God is dead, I am the devil

Soul reaper
Soul sweeper

I am the great deceiver
I have caused so many wars
Those who opposed me
Never lived to tell
I had my acts accepted
I had my will understood
I caused all the mindtrips
I manipulate

Soul sweeper

God is dead, your god is dead
God is dead, I am the devil

Soul reaper
Soul sweeper
