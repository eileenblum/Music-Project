The truth is buried under a thick layer of lies
The accidents that happened were never a coincidence
The course of history was not that unpredictable
Our way of thinking leads us in the wrong direction

Don't you think they know where you were last night?
Don't you think they know what you did last summer?
There's nowhere you can go undetected
The all seeing eye is there all the time

They decide what's right or wrong
The words you speak, every word you read
They'll put you away, enemy of the state

Every move you make
Every step you take
All the tings you read
All the things you like
They're checking you
Enemy of the state

The truth will be buried under a thick layer of lies
All accidents that'll happen will never be coincidence
The course of the future will never be unpredictable
Our way of thinking should lead us in the right direction

They decide what's right or wrong
The words you speak, every word you read
They'll put you away, enemy of the state

Every move you make
Every step you take

All the things you read
All the things you like
They're checking you
Enemy of the state
