Dictators of the free world
Dictators of the oppressed
Claim to have God on their side
In the battle against evil

Your god is dead
The devil is you

Don't talk to me about values of life
If you cross the line time after time
Point your finger at your enemy
I point my finger at you all

May god be with us in the battle against evil
But you're the one who killed your god
And placed yourself upon the throne

Upon the throne, the throne of God

Dictators of the free world
Dictators of the oppressed
Don't try to wash your hands in innocence
You and all your vermin
Your colour is blood red

Behold the gods of terror
Play their game of crime
Behold the gods of terror
Drag us down in misery
Behold the gods of terror
Speeding the end of time

[Repeat all verses]
