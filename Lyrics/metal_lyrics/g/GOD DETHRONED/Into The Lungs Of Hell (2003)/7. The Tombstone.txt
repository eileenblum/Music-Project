Darkness surrounding me
I'm waiting here till you free me

Lifting the tombstone
And what do you see
Lifting the tombstone
A skeleton waiting to be free

Don't wait too long
The worms, they're raging on

Lifting the tombstone
And what do you see
Lifting the tombstone
A skeleton waiting to be free

Imprisoned in this box with blackness

Feels like you've forgotten me

Battles in the north
Bats in the sky
South of heaven is where it all went wrong
Digging a hole in the blackhole sun
Draining the chalice of blood with the body of christ

Moving the tombstone

Moving the tombstone

Do you hear the sound of the wind in the trees?

Do you hear the grass growing, my body decomposing
It's cold, it's so cold
It's cold, six feet under
Do you hear the sound of the wind in the trees?
Do you hear the grass growing, my body decomposing?

Darkness surrounding me
I'm waiting here till you set me free

Lifting the tombstone
And what do you see?
Lifting the tombstone
A skeleton waiting to be free

Don't wait too long
The worms, they're raging on

Lifting the tombstone
And what do you see?
Lifting the tombstone
A skeleton waiting to be free

Moving the tombstone

Moving the tombstone

Lifting the tombstone
And what do you see?
Lifting the tombstone
A skeleton waiting to be free
