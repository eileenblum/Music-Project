I am the leader of the local mob
I live by the rules of crime
I have never felt any remorse
When I oppressed the weak

I need you to satisfy my need for greed
To reach my goal I became a politician
I will tell you all the things you wanna hear
Empowered by my propaganda system

Sigma enigma
I open the door to a new dimension
Sigma enigma
I will create your reality
Believe in me, I am the answer to your questions
To be concealed forever and ever

All of them who once where against me
Just dissappeared like they`d never been there
I am so good, I am the greatest
Live by my code, it`s all based on fear

Sigma enigma
I open the door to a new dimension
Sigma enigma
Your God is dead so here I am
Believe in me, I am the answer to your questions
To be concealed forever and ever

My way is just another road to ruin
You don`t know, you shouldn`t know anyway
I lie to you, I rip you off but you don`t see it
When you find out who I really am it`s too late

Sigma enigma
I open the door to a new dimension
Sigma enigma
Follow me into my hell
Sigma enigma
Nothing is really what it seems
Sigma enigma
