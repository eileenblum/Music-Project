The priest is raped, the churches burn
Reality of lost existance
Catastrophy was long foreseen
Nothing`s done, it had to be
Rape the world for inbreed ghosts
The lunatics to reign this world
Dehydrate the holy wells
Castrate the redeemer

You`ve deceived me, you`ve betrayed me
You ran away with the devil`s gold
Cut the flesh, slay the soul
You`ve deceived me, you`ve betrayed me
You ran away with the devil`s gold
I will teach you obedience
Loyal to the crown of God Dethroned

Spirits of a higher kind don`t show their flesh
You must be blind
Give your blood to Satan`s son
It`s a dirty job but should be done
Nightmares of the holy ghost
Smacked around a banished foe
Creators of the devil`s children
Spread around your demon seed

You`ve deceived me, you`ve betrayed me
You ran away with the devil`s gold
Cut the flesh, slay the soul
You`ve deceived me, you`ve betrayed me
You ran away with the devil`s gold
I will teach you obedience
Loyal to the crown of God Dethroned

Jesus wept, Mary bled
Forlorn the tales of religious fantasy
Jesus wept, Mary bled
Forlorn the tales of religious lunacy

The priest is raped, the churches burn
Reality of lost existance
Catastrophe was long foreseen
Nothing`s done, it had to be
Rape the world for inbreed ghosts
The lunatics to reign this world
Dehydrate the holy wells
Castrate the redeemer

You`ve deceived me, you`ve betrayed me
You ran away with the devil`s gold
Cut the flesh, slay the soul
You`ve deceived me, you`ve betrayed me
You ran away with the devil`s gold
I will teach you obedience
Loyal to the crown of God Dethroned
