What do you do when you lost faith?
Just pretend it`s nothing
A crown of thorns on your head
You are the king of the damned
Now you`re here, your body drained
A victim of betrayal by your own kind
They followed you, now they sold your soul to the devil

Rusty nails through your hands
Rusty nails through your soul
Rusty nails, spikes in your flesh
Rusty nails, blood in your eyes

After a day your body`s sore
Flies feasting on your body
Your mouth is dry, your brain is numb
Constant hallucinations
The criminals hanging next to you blabber all kinds of bullshit
It makes you crazy, it drives you mad
You wished them dead now don`t you?

Rusty nails through your hands
Rusty nails through your soul
Rusty nails, spikes in your flesh
Rusty nails, blood drips in your eyes

Long was the walk through Jerusalem
Dragging the cross all through the streets
Lost all contact with sanity
Hallucinations torture your feeble mind
Temptations of lust and blasphemy
Sucked dry by the whores of Babylon

Rusty nails through your hands
Rusty nails through your soul
Rusty nails, spikes in your flesh
Rusty nails, blood drips in your eyes
Rusty nails through your hands
Rusty nails through your soul
Rusty nails, rusty nails
Rusty nails
