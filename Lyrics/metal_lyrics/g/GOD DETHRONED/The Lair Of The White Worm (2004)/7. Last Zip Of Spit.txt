Dictatorship is what you aim for
But what you need is a kick in the teeth
What makes you think God protects you
Soon you`ll learn that`s not the case

I`ll take your blood to feed my hate
`cause it`s you I despise
What I`ll do is save for you
The last zip of spit

Chopped off your head, chopped off your limbs
Chopped off everything
Cut out your heart, cut out your eyes
I ripped you all apart

I`ll take your blood to feed my hate
`cause it`s you I despise
What I`ll do is save for you
The last zip of spit

Stab your knife into my back
And twist the blade around
You could kill me easily
But not if I would kill you first

I pull out the knife plunged into your chest
The blood is spraying in my face
So I can`t even see you die
I guess your veins will be drained

I`ll take your blood to feed my hate
`cause it`s you I despise
What I`ll do is save for you
The last zip of spit

Stab your knife into my back
And twist the blade around
You could kill me easily
But not if I would kill you first
Die !

Broken bones stick out of your flesh
It was me out of control
Then the final convulsion comes
It brings you peace eternally

I`ll take your blood to feed my hate
`cause it`s you I despise
What I`ll do is save for you
The last zip of spit

Stab your knife into my back
And twist the blade around
You could kill me easily
But not if I would kill you first
Now die !
Die !
