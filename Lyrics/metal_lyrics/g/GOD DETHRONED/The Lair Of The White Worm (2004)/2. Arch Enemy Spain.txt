From the south they came
In battle for the king of Spain
In the lowlands hell
After the iconoclast
Heretics rage unbound
Against the church

The duke of Alva, coming from Spain
Fought our country with an iron will
Raised the blood council the devil`s way

Their army came so strong
To control this land they thought
They forgot the sea
Then the buccaneers they came
To fight arch enemy Spain
Reclaim our land

This war would last for 80 years
The prince of Nassau, lead this rebel land
Victory, the enemies defeat
Win the war against arch enemy Spain

The king of spain, sick and tired of this game
Hired an assassin, Balthazar
This rebel leader had to be taken away
To become the assassins prey, Balthazar

The duke of Alva, coming from Spain
Lost this country against his masters will
Retreated his armies or what was left

Then the assassin came to kill our prince for Spain
Shot in the head
From the south they came
In battle for the king of Spain
In the lowlands hell

Balthazar, Balthazar, I forgive you
