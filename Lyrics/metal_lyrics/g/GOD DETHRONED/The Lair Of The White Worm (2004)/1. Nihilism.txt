Hang all the living `till they`re dead
Start a war to end a war in your head

Watch the crimson dawn as blood rains from the sky
Target destroyed, another target destroyed
Cleans the earth with the fires of choronzon
Target destroyed, another target destroyed

I am the enemy of the grandest kind
Extinction of the human race is on my mind
And what`s the point of digging countless graves
When there`s no-one left to dig these countless graves

On the killing fields the countdown has begun
Target destroyed, another target destroyed
For a nihilist nothing is at least something
Target destroyed, another target destroyed

Hang all the living `till they`re dead
Start a war to end a war in your fucking head
Watch the crimson dawn as blood rains from the sky
Target destroyed, target destroyed, another target destroyed
Cleans the earth with the fires of choronzon
I am the enemy of the grandest kind
What`s the point of digging countless graves
When there`s no-one left to dig these countless graves

On the killing fields the countdown has begun
Target destroyed, target destroyed, another target destroyed
For a nihilist nothing is at least something
Target destroyed, target destroyed, another target destroye
