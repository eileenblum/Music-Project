I make you see the things you don`t wanna see
I make you feel the things you don`t wanna feel

You`re in my blood, I`m in your blood
I hate you for it you fucking slug
You`ve created me, I`ll be haunting you eternally
You fucking slug 

Salt in your wounds

Anger, hatred, violence, all the time
Bleeding, dying, screaming "help me"
Give it back, pass it on, on and on, on and on
This sickness must die with me

The demon you once feared now becomes reality

You`re in my blood, I`m in your blood
I hate you for it you fucking slug
You`ve created me, I`ll be haunting you eternally
You fucking slug 

Salt in your wounds

The meaning of hate became clear to me
A life with violence is my reality
More and more, day by day 
The anger is consuming me
A murderer grows in me
I`ll keep the wounds open
I think of you when I torture them
A cry for help will not be heard
More and more, day by day
I realise there`s no turning back

What you did to me I`ll do to them
A suicide or a life in pain
Lost all dignity
Self inflicted pain

The meaning of hate became clear to me
A life with violence is my reality
More and more, day by day 
The anger is consuming me
A murderer grows in me
I`ll keep the wounds open
I think of you when I torture them
A cry for help will not be heard
More and more, day by day
I realise there`s no turning back

What you did to me I`ll do to them
A suicide or a life in pain
Lost all dignity
Self inflicted pain

Salt in your wounds
Let`s pour some salt in your wounds
