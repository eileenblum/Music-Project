Overcrowded realms filled with lunatic zombies
Conflicts of interest and religions "for a better world"
A spark to start the fires of war
Baring hate and living without sense

Kingdoms tumbling, people crumbling
World is numbing and fading into darkness
Careless, senseless, wandering into nothingness

Leaders of the realms, hiding and running
From the mirror of death and evil

I wait and wonder where we are to go
Loss of hope becoming stronger
It won`t be long till the final breath is to come
Death is hunting a rotten sickness

Kingdoms tumbling, people crumbling
World is numbing and fading into darkness
Careless, senseless, wandering into nothingness

Leaders of the realms, hiding and running
From the mirror of death and evil

A new world order
First class disorder
The coming of the grey race
We`re trapped in so many ways
Like rats in a small cage
Fighting for a little bit of space
A new world order
First class disorder

Kingdoms tumbling, people crumbling
World is numbing and fading into darkness
Careless, senseless, wandering into nothingness

Leaders of the realms, hiding and running
From the mirror of death and evil

A new world order
First class disorder
The coming of the grey race
We`re trapped in so many ways
Like rats in a small cage
Fighting for a little bit of space
A new world order
First class disorder
