The shelling is waxing to a demented fury
Soldiers buried alive, swallowed by the earth
Out of the haze, a dense line of men
Begins to approach over corpse strewn roads
Gigantic roaring of innumerable guns
The wave of fire has moved up to the first lines
Decisive battle, the last charge is here
The great moment's at hand

Join our march for victory
Over enemy soil
Affect the course of destiny
For my king and my land

The earth is raped
And sown with dead
Ruined beyond recognition
The madness never ends

Trapped in their trenches, they've got nowhere to run
Declining resistance, they're falling one by one
Outnumbered and wounded, they await their final blow
With bajonets on our rifles we hunt them down

Join our march for victory
Over enemy soil
Affect the course of destiny
For my king and my land

The earth is raped
And sown with dead
Ruined beyond recognition
The madness never ends

The war is over, the killings' done
All hail to those who joined our march for victory
The fields are empty, the souls are gone
Of those who lie on fields of death and desolation
A kingdom gone, all hail to them
We gave their lives for fields of death and desolation
