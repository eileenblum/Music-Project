Another gory carnival beckons
Going through shredded wire entanglements
Attack through dense rifle fire
Over the edge into the trench â storm of steel

Iron splinters battering down on our heads
Wade through a storm of steel
Shots exchanged at point blank range
Dying in a storm of steel

Human sacrifice
On enemy soil
In the grip of rage
On the brink of death

A full battle-strength company going down
To a few demoralized men
Feeling completely apathetic
Our rage broke down like a storm

My eyes are drenched with blood
Bleeding to death in a murderous sector of trench
Behind crimson surging clouds
Hear the echoing cry of war â storm of steel

Immense desire to destroy
Inflamed by berserk fury
Corpses lying all around
In this apocalyptic scene

Human sacrifice
On enemy soil
In the grip of rage
On the brink of death

Iron splinters battering down on our heads
Wade through a storm of steel
Shots exchanged at point blank range
Dying in a storm of steel

Storm of steel
