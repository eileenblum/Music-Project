Shells of shrapnel flying over our heads
Fountains of mud pile up to the sky

Atrocious artillery fire
Creating a colossal wall of flame
Rattling machine guns
Spewing fire like mad machines
Thunderous roaring
Bombs looping high up in the air
Shells falling down in the trenches
Soldiers collapse in a bloody heap

Fire storm

Incredible massing of forces
In the hour of destiny
To fight for a distant future
And the violence it unleashed

The clouds of our gas shells beaten back by a headwind
Overwhelmed by the blunt force, a raging fire-storm

This place looks grisly
Scattered around this scorched site are bodies
Burned beyond recognition

Shells of shrapnel flying over our heads
Fountains of mud pile up to the sky

Atrocious artillery fire
Creating a colossal wall of flame
Rattling machine guns
Spewing fire like mad machines
Thunderous roaring
Bombs looping high up in the air
Shells falling down in the trenches
Soldiers collapse in a bloody heap

Fire storm

Incredible massing of forces
In the hour of destiny
To fight for a distant future
And the violence it unleashed
