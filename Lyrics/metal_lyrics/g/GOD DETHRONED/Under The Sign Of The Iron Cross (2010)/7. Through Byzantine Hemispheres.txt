Beast in the east
Cross the frontiers
As a cure for the pain
They reclaim their lands

Harsh winter conditions
Poorly equipped men
Rebel militia fighting
For both sides

Massacres conducted on local population
Occupational forces committing ethnic cleansing

Masses of men collide
In a fight over dead land
The puppets on the front line
Their ignorance is used for a lost cause

Through Byzantine hemispheres
