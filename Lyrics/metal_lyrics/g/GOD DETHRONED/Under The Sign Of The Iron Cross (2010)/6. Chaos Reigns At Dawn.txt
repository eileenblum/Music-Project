Bloodthirsty eyes
Lying in wait
Behind rifles and machine guns
In the dead land
Fighting, raging, killing
Take no prisoners
No living soul in the wasteland
We want no prisoners

The guns ahead fall silent
Defenders have been finished off
The ground is littered with corpses
Chaos reigns at dawn

Hovering clouds of choking yellow gas
Drifting slowly about
Death is spreading around
There where the wind blows
No air left to breathe

Emerging from clouds of dust and smoke
Shock troopers appear, from the frontline
Feel no dread of approaching death
Chaos reigns at dawn

Phosphor shells explode
men rolling on the ground
Desperate horror
Unable to quench the flames

The wounded are wailing around
Crying for help
Pale faces staring into the eyes of death

Bloodthirsty eyes
Lying in wait
Behind rifles and machine guns
In the dead land
Fighting, raging, killing
Take no prisoners
No living soul in the wasteland
We want no prisoners

The guns ahead fall silent
Defenders have been finished off
The ground is littered with corpses
Chaos reigns at dawn

Hovering clouds of choking yellow gas
Drifting slowly about
Death is spreading around
There where the wind blows
No air left to breathe

Emerging from clouds of dust and smoke
Shock troopers appear, from the frontline
Feel no dread of approaching death
Chaos reigns at dawn
