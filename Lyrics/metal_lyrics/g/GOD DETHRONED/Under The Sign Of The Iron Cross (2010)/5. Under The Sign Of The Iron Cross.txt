Born of arrogance
Conceived from a plan millenniums ago
Tactical supremacy
The seeds of disaster already in the plan
No more loyalty
Strike hard, kill fast and claim the victory
Defeat the enemy
In an all out war

The enemies are overrun
We'll force them to their knees
Behold the master plan
We'll force them to their knees

Evade the stalemate
Sweep the country in a decisive blow
Provoke the enemy
Out of their defense and destroy them all at once
Invading armies
Crush the enemy with a massive strike
All hail to the emperor
Under the sign of the iron cross

For my country here is my master plan
We will overrun the west, then take the east
No two front war, we can only take them one by one
"A man if born and not made a strategist"
They have chosen me to be the mastermind
For God and empire this is my master plan

The enemies are overrun
We'll force them to their knees
Behold the master plan
We'll force them to their knees

Born of arrogance
Conceived from a plan millenniums ago
Tactical supremacy
The seeds of disaster already in the plan
No more loyalty
Strike hard, kill fast and claim the victory
All hail to the emperor
Under the sign of the iron cross
