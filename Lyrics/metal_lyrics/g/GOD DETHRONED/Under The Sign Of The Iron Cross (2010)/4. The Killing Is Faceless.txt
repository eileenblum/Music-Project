Bombardments pulverising trenches
Soldiers ripped to pieces
Or buried underneath the earth
All must die â the killing is faceless

Hammering the enemy
Heavy casualties
Clinging to a death trap

Never cease fire
Continuous assaults
Artillery bombardments

Infantry shock tactics
Artillery positions
Firing down the hill

Heading for disaster
Marching on and on
Through an endless field of craters

The shelling remains relentless
Human remains hanging in tree branches
Fighting in fortified graveyards
All must die â the killing is faceless

Stormtroopers lead the attack
Thrown into combat, no turning back
Flamethrowers clear the trenches
Fight for your country, die without glory

Struggling onward wade through mud
No breakthrough, counter attack
Mission impossible, all hope is lost
Fight for your country, die without glory
