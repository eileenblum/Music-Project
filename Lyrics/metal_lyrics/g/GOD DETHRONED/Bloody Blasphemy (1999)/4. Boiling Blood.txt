Bastard, bastard, a purple haze is all is see. Boiling blood. Foam at your
mouth, your eyes turn away. Boiling blood. I'm a voodoo child and I just
finished this little puppet. The spitting image of you. I'm gonna torture this
little creature. Pathetic lookalike of a loser that's you. Stick needles and
pins in it's spine now you're lame. Saw off your legs and suck out your
brains. Bastard, bastard, a purple haze is all is see. Boiling blood. Foam at
your mouth, your eyes turn away. Boiling blood. In my veins, boiling blood.
Through my brains, boiling blood. Stabbing victims, boiling blood. Draining
bodies, boiling blood. Boiling blood.
