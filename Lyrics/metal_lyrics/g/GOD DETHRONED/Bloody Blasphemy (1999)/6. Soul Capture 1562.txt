They're never silent, the seas, on which we sail. Longing for distant shores
we cannot find. The weather's bad and we need shelter. But our captain sails
on and on. I dare you God to challenge me. On these wild and stormy seas. I
challenge you to shink this ship. But your powers weak and I will win. And
then a spirit appears on deck. The captain he commands 'Leave this ship'. The
spirit remains frozen, the captain shoots. But his gun explodes in his hands.

The spirit laughs. I curse thee captain. And your ship to wander the earth.
And all the souls you'll ever engage. Won't live long enough to tell the tale.

[lead - Jens]

From the ivory coast to the West indies I've sailed. And I was there to ship
the slaves to their destiny. The seas have never been too rough for me. But
this time I must admit it's beyond insanity. I dare you God to challenge me.
On these wild and stormy seas. A spirit spoke, a spirit cursed this ship. To
dwell eternaly. THe spirits of the universe have gathered to watch me bleed.
And when this curse will ever leave I don't know. I never believed in demons
or in witchery. Well they are here they've taken my soul.

I dare you God to challenge me. On these wild and stormy seas. A spirit spoke,
a spirit cursed this ship. To dwell eternaly. Across the seven seas, she
dwells eternally. Acros the seven seas, she dwells eternaly. Help me, join me.
On my endless voyage.

Soul capture. 1562.
