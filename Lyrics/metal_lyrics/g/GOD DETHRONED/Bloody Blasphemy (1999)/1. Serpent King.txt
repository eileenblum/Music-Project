I'm the serpent king. From the heavens I once came. And I choose your soul. To
have and hold forever. Feel my presence every second. But my body travels
undetected. Now. I'm gonna shoot you from real close. I'm the serpent king.
From the heavens I once came. It's your soul that I will take from you. For I
am the serpent king.

You're coughing up blood. But that's only temporary. As soon as it stops.
You're free to be a part of me. Feel my presence every second. But my body
travels undetected. Now. I'm gonna shoot you from from real close. I'm the
serpent king. From the heavens I once came. It's your soul that I will take
from you. For I am the serpent king.
