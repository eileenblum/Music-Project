Firebreathing through your unseigable fortress. I'm the devil and Michael De
Ruyter's my name. I ride on the waves, right through your chains. You are my
prey and you'll never forget my name. A firebreath, a crimson sky, in a lake
of fire you will die. The English pride, consumed by flames, you'll never
forget my name.

Firebreath, spritting forks of fire. Firebreath, attacking a crumbling empire.
Firebreath, the Dutchman's anger. Firebreath, a fire's breath. The voyage to
Chatham. in 1667. The three day wat, never equalled again. Capture the Royal
Charles, the English flagship.

The river Thames, the bleeding English heart. A firebreath, a crimson sky, in
a lake of fire you will die. The English pride, consumed by flames, you'll
never forget my name. A thousand cannonballs, rain down on my deck. Of the
Seven Provincies, the republic's battleship number one. But they do no harm,
cause Satan's wings protect. His servant's life, from the English last
convulsion.
