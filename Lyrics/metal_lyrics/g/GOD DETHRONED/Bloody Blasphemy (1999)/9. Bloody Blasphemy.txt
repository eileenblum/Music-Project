On the day you died, they just left you there. Did you think that I didn't
care? I just hated the idea of having no share. My stomach ached for some
juicy flesh. That night on the hill. After the golgotha kill. You thought I
would help, but I'm sorry. Jesus Christ. They nailed you alive. I tore you
off, it hurt I'm sorry. I was waiting, then disappearing with you, for you to
shine before God. Holding you in my arms with love. To eat you with love, with
love.

Bloody blasphemy.
