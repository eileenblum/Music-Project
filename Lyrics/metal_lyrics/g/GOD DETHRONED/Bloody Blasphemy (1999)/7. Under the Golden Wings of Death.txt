Shrouded in a cold dark mist, my mind is urging me to kill, forced, by an
unseen hand. I cross the boundary between good and evil time and time again.
As I watch you die. While the blood runs down to earth. Your screaming warms
my body. Like the sun on a cold winters day. I'm the captor of your soul.
Stole you from this earth. Never to be seen again. Unaware in that night.
Under the golden wings of death.

Shrouded in a cold dark mist, my mind is urging me to kill, forced, by an
unseen hand. I cross the boundary between good and evil time and time again.
Under the golden wings of death. Shrouded in a cold dark mist, my mind is
urging me to kill, forced, by an unseen hand. I cross the boundary between
good and evil time and time again. I'm the captor of your soul. I stole your
body from the earth. Unaware in that night. Of the horror that was coming your
way.

Under the golden wings of death.
