I am staggering through these empty streets.
I know I've been here before.
But still I don't know where I am.
Or where to go, the world around me seems unreal.

City lights creating shadows on the walls.
Macabre world. I'm seeing things I cannot see.
What's happening? I can't find my way.
Macabre world. I think I lost my mind.

Out in the freezing cold.
I fail to find a trail.
Walking for hours.
In desolate streets where no-one goes.

I feel so old.
I hate this place
I feel so old - This cannot be me.
I feel so alone - This cannot be real.

Out in the freezing cold.
I fail to find a trail.
Walking for hours.
In desolate streets where no-one goes.

Judas has been haunting me.
When I turn around the other way.
It seems like it's all changed.
A missing link, no open view.

City lights creating shadows on the walls.
Macabre world. I'm seeing things I cannot see.
What's happening? I can't find my way.
Macabre world. I think I lost my mind.
