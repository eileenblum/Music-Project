(You've got)
No comprehension for my train of thought.
Realising no-one cares a damn about me.
Disqualified by the tyrants I see.
What if -I'd love to- make you scream.

Symptoms of hate.
My decision's made.

No more attention for the rules of you game.
Pushing the needles, feel the stabbing pain.
I had a bad trip according to design.
It made me restless, now I do know why.

Symptoms of hate.
My decision's made.
This withered soul.
Will destroy you all.

And bring you down!
Down!
Falling down!
Feel my raging breath.
Now!
Down!
Falling down!
Let me bring you doom.

Now give me one fucking reason why I should let you go.
Let me inject my disease and take over control.
Just give me all that is left from the hope you caress.
let me inhale your fear. Suck you dry. Makes me smile.

Down!
Down!
Falling down!
Feel my raging breath.
Now!
Down!
Falling down!

I will bring you down!
Down!
Falling down!
Feel my raging breath.
Now!
Down!
Falling down!
Let me bring you doom.
