In 2014 they take the world by storm.
We don't know who they are, but they'll come that's for sure.

2014
The dawning of a new day.
Take the world by storm.
All is lost and gone.

There's story in the bible, it's written in blood.
Nostradamus' predictions don't go beyond this point.

2014
The dawning of a new day.
Take the world by storm.
All is lost and gone.

Apocalyptic raids.
See the horsemen ride.
Apocalyptic raids.
When the sky turns red.

Something wicked this way comes.
The beast is rising. All (hope) is lost.

Apocalyptic raids.
See the horsemen ride.
Apocalyptic raids.
When the sky turns red.

In 2014 they take the world by storm.
We don't know who they are, but they'll come that's for sure.

2014
The dawning of a new day.
Take the world by storm.
