Looking at these white walls everyday of my life.
Behind the bars in the window of my prison cell.
I've been on my own the last seven years of my life.
A failure of society. They put the blame on me.

My shrink he thinks he's got me under control.
But I made him my slave, I won't let go.
As soon as I come out I'll kill again.

[Lead: Delahaye]

let this be a warning.
Don't keep me locked away.
I bow to no-one.
I feel stronger every day.
You say I'm nothing because I fail to exist.
So I won't stay here because I fail to exist.

They think they've got me under control.
But I made them my slave, I won't let go.
As soon as I come out I'll kill again.
Outside they think they're safe. Just think again.

I'm sick and tired of staring at these walls.
Don't wanna see the bars no more. Now open the cage.
Seven years alone, on my own was long enough.
I might be a failure of society, but don't you say I fail to exist.

I fail to exist.
