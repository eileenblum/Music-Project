When the night falls, Mary walks the streets.
When she gets your attention, you'll meet the beast.

Oh heavenly creature.
Black as the night.
Unpure as Jezebel.
Satan's delight.

Filled with hate, in her cold black heart.
Voices in her head. Meet the beast inside.

Angel of vengeance.
Seducing you.
Once you get to touch her.
Vengeance is sweet.

Die. You will die on your knees. Die.
Feel the Judas kiss. From her poison lips.
Now close your eyes before you die.

Oh heavenly creature.
Black as the night.
Unpure as Jezebel.
Satan's delight.

Mary's got a dead cold heart.
Her pitch black soul has died so long ago.
Killing keeps her alive.
On wings of pestilence (she flies through the night).

Mary's on the streets at night, killing for lust.
Davil's daughter, Judas' harlot. Satan's delight.

Angel of vengeance.
Seducing you.
Once you get to touch her.
Vengeance is sweet.

Die. You will die on your knees. Die.
Feel the Judas kiss. From her poison lips.
Now close your eyes before you die.

Oh heavenly creature.
Black as the night.
Unpure as Jezebel.
Satan's delight.

Mary's got a dead cold heart.
Her pitch black soul has died so long ago.
Killing keeps her alive.
On wings of pestilence (she flies through the night).
