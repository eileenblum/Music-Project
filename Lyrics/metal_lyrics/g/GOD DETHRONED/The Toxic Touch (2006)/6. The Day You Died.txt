Feel the touch of death.
Feel the toxic touch.
Life never meant anything to you.

But now when it's almost over.
When the end comes closer.
You regret the fact you never really lived.

Life's abandoning you.
In a brutal way.
The curtain falls, it's all over.

Now you're scared.
To cross the border.
I wish I could help you to ease the pain.

The fire in your eyes has died.
You are the one who walks in a dead end street.
Now you cry. You cry bitter tears.
This day will stay in my mind as the day you died.

Don't think about, this punishment.
You never cared 'bout anyone but yourself.
Still I wish, I could take your place.
To make you stay with us and live your life.

The fire in your eyes has died.
You are the one who walks in a dead end street.
Now you cry. You cry bitter tears.
This day will stay in my mind as the day you died.

Alive.
Stay alive.
In my mind you stay alive.

The fire in your eyes has died.
You are the one who walks in a dead end street.
Now you cry. You cry bitter tears.
This day will stay in my mind as the day you died.

Alive.
Stay alive.
In my mind you stay alive.
