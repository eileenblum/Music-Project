I drown in depressions.
Countless addictions wear me down.
Here's a confession.
I'm gonna kill myself tonight.

The downward spiral.
An endless stream of accidents.
I feel so useless.
I'm better off dead.

Hating life.

Look in my eyes. You'll see the dark.
A sharpened knife. Will set me free.

No more frustrations.
About all the bad shit in my life.
I see no future.
Don't wanna fight another day.

I hate this life.
So much you won't understand.$
I'm sick and tired,
Of this downhill ride.

Hating life.

I hate this life.
I have paid my dues.
I don't see the light.
So I won't stick around.

I drown in depressions.
Countless addictions wear me down.
Here's a confession.
I'm gonna kill myself tonight.

The downward spiral.
An endless stream of accidents.
I feel so useless.
I'm better off dead.

Hating life.

Look in my eyes. You'll see the dark.
A sharpened knife. Will set me free.

Hating life.
