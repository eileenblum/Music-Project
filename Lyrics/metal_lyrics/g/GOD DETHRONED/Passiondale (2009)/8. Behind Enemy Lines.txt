The march has come to a hold
From victory to disaster
Massive assault but your enemy runs faster
Attacking in waves, still no one returns
Battalions die in demise
It's time to get behind enemy lines

Behind enemy lines

A battalion on top of the hill
With a grand view it's an easy kill
A big dense cloud of smoke fills the sky
Blown into oblivion
The effort was big, the tunnel was long
It was worth the work and the enemy's gone
We finally marched on, then the first tanks came rolling in

Fear is in your eyes
Another bloody curse
Crushed by a fucking tank

Chaos in your mind
Running out of luck
Down the muddy road of extinction

Nothing you can do
Nowhere left to hide
The bloody thing spitting hell fire

You want to stay alive
You keep your head low
But the time has come to meet your maker

The march has come to a hold
From victory to disaster
Massive assault but your enemy runs faster
Attacking in waves, still no one returns
Battalions die in demise
It's time to get behind enemy lines

Behind enemy lines
