Tales of disaster traveled fast
The ruins of nature, debris of man
The war is over, the cause is lost
Nine million dead

Shellshocked and wounded
Legs lost, arms shattered
False promises, false hopes
Nine million dead

Prisoners of war convoyed to the camps
Now the war is over, you're not going home
Another cold winter lies ahead of you
Death is your reward, prisoner of war

Architects of war
Weary of battle
Fragile alliance
Fallen empires
