Daybreak, cannons fire
Attack a bleeding empire
Their armies they lie in wait
No escape it's too late

Join our army, join our war
Now's the time to settle the score
The war to end all wars

From far they came, from foreign lands
Grim forces marching on
Under a darkening sky

Arch enemy you won't defy
Take no prisoners, take their lives
March into the enemy lands
March, two, three, four

Under a darkening sky

Die
No hope, No glory
Die
No victory
Die
Under a darkening sky
