Your country needs you, so come and join our war
It's fun and takes you places you've never seen before

Dying races colliding on battlefields
Bodies lying around you and rotting in pools
Drowning in mud, your army is stuck
As far as my eyes can see there's misery

Trench wars caused by stalemate
Digging a hole, now it's your home
You wanna leave but you're stuck in the mud
Then there's the rat. He becomes your best friend

Don't stick your head out. The sniper never sleeps
Cannons roar as you storm the enemy

Dying races colliding on battlefields
Bodies lying around you and rotting in pools
Drowning in mud, your army is stuck
As far as my eyes can see there's misery

Drowning in mud

Trying to stay alive
Drowning in mud and die

Trench wars caused by stalemate
Digging a hole, now it's your home
You wanna leave but you're stuck in the mud
Then there's the rat. He becomes your best friend

Don't stick your head out. The sniper never sleeps
Cannons roar as you storm the enemy

Dying races colliding on battlefields
Bodies lying around you and rotting in pools
Drowning in mud, your army is stuck
As far as my eyes can see there's misery
