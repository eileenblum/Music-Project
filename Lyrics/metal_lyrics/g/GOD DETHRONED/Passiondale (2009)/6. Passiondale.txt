Take a shot at glory on the hills of Passiondale
Prepare the artillery to blow away the troops on the other side

Traumatized, entrenched for life
Cannons point at the enemy
Under siege for years and years
We're swept away from the earth

A serenade in lead
For all those who died
Wartime atrocities
No sign of life

No escape from Passiondale

Grenades rain down on our fortress day and night
My brain is numb
I lost all my friends
Will it ever stop
There's no escape, it seems too late
For god and country, we try to endure this living hell

Take a shot at glory on the hills of Passiondale
Prepare the artillery to blow away the troops on the other side

A serenade in lead
For all those who died
Wartime atrocities
No sign of life
