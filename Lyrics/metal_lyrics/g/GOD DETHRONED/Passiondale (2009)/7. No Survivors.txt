The sun is dawning on another sea of blood and mud
March against machine guns like lambs being driven to the slaughter
Tornadoes of shrapnel
The wounded sinking in three feet of mud
Dying grotesquely
Wading through the swamp among the carnage

No!!!!!

-Our last assault for victory
-Shattered by machine gun fire
-Bombs rain down in cataracts
-Carnival of death

Shellshocked, paralyzed, staring into the gloom
Penalties for desertion
Death the reward for cowardice
Salvos, cannonades, unleashing hysteria of rage
The senselessness of it all grew like a cancer in the minds of the troops

No!!!!

-Our last assault for victory
-Shattered by machine gun fire
-Bombs rain down in cataracts
-Carnival of death

No survivors

For weeks I have waited in this mud
I'm shaking, I'm wet
The stench of my dead friends
Relieved when we finally march in
This waiting is killing me
Traumatized eyes, as we go in
Bodies everywhere, the bullets scream
We can't survive but we march in
Nothing to win but I go in
Don't care if this killing is a sin
I just want to end this hell I'm in
I hit the bottom, we did not win

No!!!!

-Our last assault for victory
-Shattered by machine gun fire
-Bombs rain down in cataracts
-Carnival of death

No survivors
