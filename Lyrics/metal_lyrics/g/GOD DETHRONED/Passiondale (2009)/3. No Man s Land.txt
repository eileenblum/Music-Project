The salient is an arc of flame
Machine guns fire in hysteria
Thousands of soldiers die every day
The wounded scream in agony
Witness the last attack of the cavalry
Gunned down and shot to pieces
The artillery created a landscape equal to the moon

Through a storm of steel
Through no man's land
Bullets blow you to kingdom come
No man's land

Only the rats grew fat on attrition
Glutted with the flesh of dead soldiers
Loathsome, bloated creatures
Half blind and big as cats
The morale of the army
Was sinking in the swamps of the salient
Vicious in victory
We're out for war, war to the death

Through a storm of steel
Through no man's land
Bullets blow you to kingdom come
No man's land

Stuck on a bayonet, or shot at dawn
Life expectancy, there is none

Men slipped and slithered
Through bloody soil on the battleground
Divisions were going across like terriers intent on flushing rats from a hole

Through a storm of steel
Through no man's land
Bullets blow you to kingdom come
No man's land
