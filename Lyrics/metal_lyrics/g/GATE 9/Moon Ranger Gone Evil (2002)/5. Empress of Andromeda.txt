Hey, Goddess of cosmic equilibrium. 
Craft our souls to raise as Titans, as 
We praise our dawn. 
Help us paint a sky, 
In neon colours, as we get high.  
Travel with us, in supersonic speed, 
As we crash with the horizon. 
Empress of Andromeda give us, 

[Ref:]
Bless us your highness, bless us with
Astral powers, help us to might, 
let us lick of your divinity, 
let us fed of your wisdom 
let us drink from you fountain.
