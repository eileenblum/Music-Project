Hey, just fire your engine, 
When your mind gets slow, 
Lock the door and hit the gas, 
and aim low. 

Hey, just fire your guns, 
Go straight but, left next turn 
And if you loose, you got 
the gas you burn. 

Drive on through the night, 
As the darkness surround you, 
You learn to know the only, truth. 
You aint got a million to one. 

[Ref:]
So just head out on La Strada Astra, 
A speed machine with light as limit, 
Youâre faster than neon, and darker 
than blue. And it burns like fire. 

Lower your shoulders 
and turn down the lights, 
There are no limits 
Lower your shoulders 
and turn down the lights, 
There are no limits 
In the next, turn right. 

[Ref:]
So just head out on La Strada Astra, 
A speed machine with light as limit, 
Youâre faster than neon, and darker 
than blue. And it burns like fire. x 2
