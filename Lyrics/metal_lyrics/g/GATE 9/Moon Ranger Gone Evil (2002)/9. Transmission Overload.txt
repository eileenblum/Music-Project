Overheated by the break of dawn, 
Deep, dark and red. 
See the sky has turned green again. 
Feelinâ the boiling blood....yeah, 

Hey, man connection established, 
To the frequencyâs not yet known, 
Let the waves fry you brain, 
by the vengeance of time. 

Hey, man connected by fire strife 
Clock of atomic distortion, 
Eternal cosmic dimension, 
blurring by vision. 
Divine to internal progression 
The frenzy of external devotion, 
Now longer, a manic submission, 
As I connect.

Feel the fire inside.....
