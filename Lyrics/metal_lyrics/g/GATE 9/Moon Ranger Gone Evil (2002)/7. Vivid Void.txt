Hey man, the sun rises in horizons 
In a new dimension of time 
The clock ticks like a pulsar drop beat 
Our planet is out of its orbit 

[Ref:]
Our journey starts as we leave our planet, 
A forth dimension, an eclipse of time 
Let the planet rest in cosmic sleep 
As we crown us kings in a power stream. 

Sucked up in the power vacuum 
Loaded in negative energy, 
The fourth dimension is our home 
And the we black sun that we now obey. 

[Ref:]
Our journey starts as we leave our planet, 
A forth dimension, an eclipse of time 
Let the planet rest in cosmic sleep 
As we crown us kings in a power stream. 

Vivid void, vivid void......
