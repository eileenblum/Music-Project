I got a gift, of receiving at frequencies 
Higher than, the mighty Gods, divine connection. 
I will receive from unknown location, 

Ready to float into Zodiac reflection, into fluid materialisation. 
Just float, just float, just float into divinity. 

[Ref:] Slaves of Tide, Weâre the slaves of tide. 

Iâm yet to be reborn this way, 
As I drift into the Zodiac, as a state of mind. 
My liquidity feels like an ever floating stream. 

[Ref:] Slaves of Tide, Weâre the slaves of tide.
