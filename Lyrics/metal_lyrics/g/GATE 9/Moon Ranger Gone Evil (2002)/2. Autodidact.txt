I was not raised this way, 
This is not the way I was brought up. 
I learned how to live well, 
I learned to live of the land. 

I'm autodidact......

Iâve learned to live supersonic, 
I was not brought up this way, 
Iâve learned to burn my fuel, 
how to use my key. 

I'm autodidact......
It's a mess...
take it away...
I'm autodidact.....
