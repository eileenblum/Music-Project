Hey man itâs gotta be a bummer, 
When you got the mighty God on your side, 
Knowing that I got the Goddess of total, 
The Goddess of total hedonism. 

If your God offers temperance 
My suggests to burn the fuel, 
got to choose between redemption, 
And the queen of Hades. 

[Soundclips of Anton LaVey]

[Ref:]
Gotta be a bummer to obey self-denial, 
When pleasure is sacred. 
Gotta be a bummer, 
to deny the pleasure of sin. 
When pleasure is sacred.

Hey man itâs gotta be a bummer, 
When you got the mighty God on your side, 
Knowing that I got the Goddess of total, 
The Goddess of total hedonism.
