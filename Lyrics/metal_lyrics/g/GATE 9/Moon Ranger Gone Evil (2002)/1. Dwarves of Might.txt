Hey- crusinâ- the ship of might, 
Neon overblown, by the break of dawn, 
The pink clowds, of the riverbank sky. 
And then we turn our heads. 

[Ref:]
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 

Hey- crusinâ â supersonic, dwarfs of might, 
Into the skyline, through gate 9. 
The last one to open, the last to close. 
Crusinâ â the dwarfs of might. 

[Ref:]
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might. 
Open all the nine,
here comes the Dwarves of Might.
