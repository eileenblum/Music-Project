Again an image in my mirror, but it's not the same
Lost its perfection without another face
As a celebration of guilt recall my demons
And another battle that's maybe my last

Now I am alone here with my crows
I'm waiting but I don't lose my hopes
I can't hear my angel singing anymore
Now remain cinder of your wings

Remains your gift of lies and apathy
Now remain only suffering

Remain cinder of your wings

Running again through the past and through the stars
Searching nothing but an illusion to kill the truth
To see you fly again over the sky
Not crawling through the land of lies

Few simple words are through to destroy my heaven
Reality becomes my hell make of remorse
Emptiness and pride, but forgiveness makes me so weak
Can I accept it?

Again an image in my mirror but it's not the same
Lost it's perfection without another face
As a celebration of guilt recall my demons
And another battle that's maybe my last

Now I am alone here with my crows
I'm waiting but I don't lose my hopes
I can't hear my angel singing anymore
Now remain cinder of your wings
