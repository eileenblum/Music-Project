Another night begins deleting hypocrisy
And we start again to breathe and live
We are nothing for five long days
Long sleeves shirt to hide some fuckin' ink

I must be yielding behind my mask of lies
And we are here together, we are the kings
Like some tools steering by a hostile fate
We cut the strings to make us free

This time runs faster and we hide from it
I hope that this night will never end
I call you brothers and it's forever true

And all the promises and all the dreams
We can't forget reality
And all the words and all the dreams
I'm sure one day it will be true

And now this hope makes me find
Find the beauty in life again

I can see them eyes behind the smoke of cigarettes
I hear them laughs like a sound that screams our hopes
I don't want come back I know

This night one day will last forever
No failure. No compromises
And no remorse

Until the end like a path of blood

The sun is rising, reality finds me again
But I know that next time will last forever

Next time will last forever
