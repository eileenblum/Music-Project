Now remorse is my only fellow till I'll take my last decision

Thousand sighs along this march that bring us to end
Thousand as voices inside my head
Trying to remember the way to come back
Trying to realize that it's too late to repent

Now remorse is my only fellow
Till I'll take my last decision
And than I'll be alone again
And than I'll be alone forever

Realize that you're alone in life
Realize that you're alone in death
Only solitude's eternal
And only our demons walk with us
Till the end of days

Can't I trust in every traitor
With a knife for every throat
And than I'll push it upon me
And I'll push it upon my dreams

Realize that you're alone in life
Realize that you're alone in death
Only solitude's eternal
And only our demons walk with us

Abandon hopes, embrace reality, be aware and cold as clay
Abandon love, forgive present, be pure and rationalist

Aware and sadist pure and rationalist
Embrace reality be pure and rationalist

The final choice is move by heart
All that remains are memories
Pray to keep them forever, pray to be aware

I can abandon my only fellow of solitude
