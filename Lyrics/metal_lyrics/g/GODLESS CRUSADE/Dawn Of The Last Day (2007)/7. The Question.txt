I embrace the end
A convalescence between life and dream
Without possibilities of recognizing reality

in this way there's no light
Darkness reflects all my fear
No tears to cry only my curses to forget
With blood on my hands
Forever rising in this new beginning

Don't call it faith
My new hope is born from conviction
The search for perfection will never end
This emptiness fill our days
Of eternal gray only new hope
Can make we fight and rise above

The need to fight for my ideals
The will to die what I believe

Only this question
What have done to make your life not pitiful?
Ask it yourself

Is it worth to going on?
