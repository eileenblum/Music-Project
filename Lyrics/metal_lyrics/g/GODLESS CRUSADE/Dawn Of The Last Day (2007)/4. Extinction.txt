The day is near when man bless his own crown
We are so grateful for the endless power of the intellect
That makes us superior

That anyone left, cause we return faster than time
We seem to be, the perfect creatures, this is our sentence

Beautiful miracles inspired by you
Art, medicine, technology

We are so humble, but we fell so divine
It's our duty to punish the ungrateful with your
beautiful miracles inspired by you
War, bombs, genocide

And we must fight for respect of our gift
Kill and die for your name

May, may this be an excuse
To satisfy our blood thirst
Weapons are a gift to use
In the name of god, in the name of lies
Apocalypse is your will
The end of days by the hands of man

Let the fire purify your souls
Let the fire command us all

Let innocents admit there own blame
Look these innocents choke into the flames

Let useless humans extinguish their race
Let useless humans die for your name

The will of god
Stupidity of man
