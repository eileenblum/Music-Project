The circle of affliction and torment collide
With the finest feeling
So much that it becomes remorse
The memories consume my ego

And they find me again from past
Burning as flames of repent
When realize the ruin made by my hands
Till bite my tongue till I choke with my own blood

The recollection is unforgiven
Perfect and now so far
It makes me descend into hysteria
It makes me pray for a second chance

The circle of affliction and torment collide
With the finest feeling
So much that it becomes remorse
The memories consume my ego

Past was an image of perfection
Happiness no matter cost
But didn't understand it

And they find me again from past
Burning as flames of repent
When realize the ruin made by my hands
Till bite my tongue till I choke with my own blood

I pretend more than perfection
And destiny will be my gift and punishment
Can I crawl again than remorse is devouring me?
It all is lost what is life without love?

I'm finally sure, I breath one last, my only will
is to live the past forever, live without your memories

I pretend more than perfection
And destiny will be my gift and punishment
Can I crawl again than remorse is devouring me?
It all is lost what is life without love?
