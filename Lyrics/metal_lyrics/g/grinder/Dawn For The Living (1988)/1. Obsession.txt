Obsession brings you to your death
Your souls spilt, darkness commanding your breath
In an age of love and trust
You'll be exorcises of your lust

Born to burn
To die in pain
In the name of hate
Help is far to late
Soon the world will know
Obsession is taking control

On the altar of death of life
You''ll lie - no mercy - you'll die
The fire becomes extinct in your eye
Always obey the beast inside

Born to burn
To die in pain
In the name of hate
Help is far to late
Soon the world will know
Obsession is taking control

[Solo: Andy]

Obsession is taking over your mind
Blackens your skin-deprives you of light
To kill your hate will grow
But your will to live is gone

Born to burn
To die in pain
In the name of hate
Help is far to late
Soon the world will know
Obsession is taking control
