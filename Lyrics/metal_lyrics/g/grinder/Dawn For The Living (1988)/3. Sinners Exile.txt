Holy father
What will you say
Who decides about
Life and fate?
No!
Not you, you are
Just like me
A bit more violent
A lot more mean...

Infect the masses with you kiss
We don't need no god like this
Don't want to hear what you pray
Ain't gonna live just like you say!

[Solo: Lario]

Father
Betrayer
Inquisitor
We'll never die
At Sinners Exile!

Holy father where Is your hand?
While other starve you get fat
Don't you care about what Jesus said?
You should lift up your fat ass

Infect the masses with you kiss
We don't need no god like this
Don't want to hear what you pray
Ain't gonna live just like you say!

[Solo: Lario]

Father
Betrayer
Inquisitor
We'll never die at...
Sinners Exile!

We'll never change our ways...
Never!
