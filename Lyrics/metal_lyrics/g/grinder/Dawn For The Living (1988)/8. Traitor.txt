Free his blood
From its chain
Pay your tribute
To the insane - Burn the torch of hate
To feed - the fires of pain
For war he calls
His friends would fall
We'll die - life by life
As long he is laughing at our side

Feel the power
The hate of his game
The poisoned life blood
Flow through his veins
Slave to the pleasure
To follow his creed
A mind cold as ice
Traitor will rage tonight

Traitors came
Shocked the world
Voices of warning
Never been heard
You knew his aim - he just declared
But you never dared - to say a word
Writing in anger
Addicted to danger
More - give us more
Enslave us - cheat us - on and on

Feel the power
The hate of his game
The poisoned life blood
Flow through his veins
Slave to the pleasure
To follow his creed
A mind cold as ice
Traitor will rage tonight
