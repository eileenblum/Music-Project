Fever, fever
Burning in his head
Fire, desire
Wishes he was dead
Keen eyesight
Begins to fade
Wonder
If he'll see another day

Defect
Perception
Image
Limbs
Lost equality
He is ready to leave
Leave an empty world
On through Delirium

Addiction, addiction
In withdraw! again
Spastic on his feet again
The last bottles
An hour ago
Drink it, one more
Support your
Dead throats

Defect
Perception
Image
Limbs
Lost equality
He is ready to leave
Leave an empty world
On through Delirium

[Solo: Lario / Andy / Lario / Andy]

He gave his best
He drunk it fast
Turned inside out
No doubt about

When he jerked
And when he fell
The others laughed
He felt so well

Booze is god
Booze is lust!
The only thing
In which he trusted

For now he is dead
Now he is safe
With a bottle
Upon his grave
