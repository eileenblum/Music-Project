From far away, a stranger has come
Old and wise he is known by everyone he knows
How to contact the spirits he is linking
Heaven and Hell...

He is healing wounds
Gives you vitality
He winds you up
Fills you with energy
He is the one
Who conquers the death
Commanding the air
Guiding your breath...

Column of fog around him, makes him
Invisible - psychological force
Makes him invincible
He might be aged
Hundreds of years
The web of time
He is ruling; supreme...

At the gates of our town, the magician arrives
Relying on a stick his hand is holding tight
For a second I look into his eyes
Burning bright
Like magic fires...
