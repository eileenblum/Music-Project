The way you look at me
The way you turn me on
The way you make me feel
Is the way you make me sick

Hey people
Look into the mirror
Do you think you look
Different then me?
Hey Fuckers!
If you think you're smarter
I call you...
Nerds! Suckers!

Well dressed
Symbol of society
You nerd symbol of success
Stop picking your Fucking nose
Mom's calling you to come home

Hey people
Look into the mirror
Do you think you look
Different then me?
Hey Fuckers!
If you think you're smarter
I call you...
Nerds! Suckers!

sucker, Fucker
Suck Off And Die!
Fuck Off And DIE!
