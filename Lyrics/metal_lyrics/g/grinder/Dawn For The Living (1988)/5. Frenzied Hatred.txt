[Solo: Andy]
Are you going out tonight?
Tell me!
I'll be right behind
Rain so cold, your steps so fast
Nervous eyes ain't gonna rest
no one there to see you home
For I wont leave you alone
You'll give me all I need
Only walls will hear you scream..

I am - addicted to your blood
I'll be - lurking in the dark
You are - the only thing I need
Victim - of my Frenzied Hatred

Shut up bitch - hold your tongue!
Can't you see I'm the only one?
I love the way you look at me
Gazes full of agony
Your little hands defend your blood
But I will take all that you've got
Tear your clothes torment your mind
Come on women! Feel my knife and die!

[Solo: Andy]

The souls of the lost meet in the dark
When someone's flesh is gonna be torn
After all he'll reach your blood
And the murderers hate will be reborn

[Solo: Lario/Andy]

Deliverance
Insanity
Deliverance
Insanity

My hands shiver, her life is gone
I can't remember what I've done
Again my hatred was too strong
Please father - take the sinner home

I am - addicted to your blood
I'll be - lurking in the dark
You are - the only thing I need
Victim - of my Frenzied Hatred

Deliverance
