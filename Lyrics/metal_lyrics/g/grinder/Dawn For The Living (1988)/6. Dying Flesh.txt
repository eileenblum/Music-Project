Dying and falling they don't feel their feet
Slave lives are fading away
Nowhere to go to but towards their end
Restless they are never released
Crying so desperate and screaming in pain
So far from where they belong
Out of humanity full of torment
Nothing to carry them home

Subhuman beings in endless pain
Mistreated and forced to their death
Branded like cattle and chained by their necks
Moving inanimate flesh

Falling
And rotting away
Fear the coming of the day
Never knew what they were living for
The enslavers will is their fate
Sun is burning, merciless steps getting slow
The devil is joining their rows
Deprived of humanity, slaves in distress
Pray to expedite their death
Abandoned
Dying
Flesh!

Guess they can take no more
Torture...Whipping...Murder!
There'll be....No De.....Liverance!
Can't walk, no more, not a step,
Stand up.. Obey your...Master!
When i...Want you...To Be!

[Solo: Lario/Andy]

Move on!
Die on!
Take breath!
Dead Flesh!

Dying and falling they don't feel their feet
