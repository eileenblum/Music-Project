Hey folks, come on let's go
We've got another job to do
Move it brothers
Climb on the horses
Introduce ourselves
As the bandit forces
Come on everybody
On your marks
Let's earn a million golden bucks
No one to stop us now
Come on you hoods
Let's go for dollars

Train raid, train raid
A perfect plan
We'll never see the jail again
Train raid, train raid
We'll try again
'Cause we're the famous Dalton clan

Averell, Willy, Jack and Joe
Are waiting for the train to come
But there's some error
They don't expect
They wait upon the iron tracks
The train is coming, what a show
The Daltons kind of over rolled
Joey screams, his brothers mute
Don't worry, they'll be back soon

Train raid, train raid
A perfect plan
We'll never see the jail again
Train raid, train raid
We'll try again
'Cause we're the famous Dalton clan

Train raid, come on folks
Let's do the train raid
Attempt number 205 is on today, oh yeah
We won't fail again
We won't miss the chance
Ain't no one gonna laugh
About the Dalton gang anymore
