Lying in my room
Silent, well improved
Out of reason, out of mind
No reaction, instincts died
But I'm alive

Reason is dead
The dreams that you've had
The person is lost
The change is perfect
Madness is gone
The system has won
Logic is real
To fit society
Total control
Total control
Total control
Total control
Transformation

Machine head is working
The program is living
White walls, protect reality
A trapped existence in lethargy
Termination of my dreams
Replant my eyes and change
The truth of sight

Reason is dead
The dreams you've had
The person is lost
The change is perfect
Madness is gone
The system has won
Logic is real
To fit society
Total control
Total control
Total control
Total control
Transformation

My resistance torn
But I'm reborn
Recreation of my mind
My memories denied
But somehow I'm alive

Reason is dead
The dreams you've had
The person is lost
The change is perfect
Madness is gone
The system has won
Logic is real
To fit society
Total control
Total control
Total control
Total control
Transformation
