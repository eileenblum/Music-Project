You don't belong
You don't belong
In the world of today
Nothing you do
Nothing you say
Will cause any change
One single fate
One single fate
Won't be missed in this state
That's all you are
That's all you'll be
And there's nothing you'll leave

Just another scar
Within the skin
A tiny drop of blood upon a pin
Another crack within the wall
Just another leaf to fall
Just another tear
Within the sea
Another day of the year
Another person within the crowd
Not even worth to care about

Another scar, another wound
A handful of dust to pour into the tomb
Some new disease
Some different death
Just another hole within the flesh

Just another scar
Within the skin
A tiny drop of blood upon a pin
Another crack within the wall
Just another leaf to fall
Just another tear
Within the sea
Another day of the year
Another person within the crowd
Not even worth to care about

Another sentence
Brand new law
Again equality picked the shortest straw
Another high jack, another riot
An armed third world
Another mercenary hired

This is the world you live in
This is existence
This is the cycle of the strong
And the weak
The nature of the wolf
To beat the sheep
So keep being brave but quiet
And be satisfied

You don't belong
You don't belong
In the world of today
Nothing you do
Nothing you say
Will cause any change
One single fate
One single fate
Won't be missed in this state
That's all you are
That's all you'll be
And there's nothing you'll leave
But another scar
Just another scar
