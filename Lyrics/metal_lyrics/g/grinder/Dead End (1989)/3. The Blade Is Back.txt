They've cured me once again
No doubt about my attitude
I'm okay don't be afraid
Disease already left my head
Feeling good, feeling fine
Nothing to burden my mind
I'll keep it calm, I'm alright
No wicked needs to satisfy

Happy walking down the street
Smiles of peace and amity
Are nothing but a hollow truce
'Cause I know better things to do
The first female legs I see
Remind me of what I need
Screaming women running fast
The kind of fun I like best

Can't take 'em, don't need 'em
Can't even stand to see 'em
The way they smell
The way they talk
I really hate the way they walk

Be sure, I'll never stop

I know you don't like me
But I don't really mind
You might think I'm mean
Believe me
It's the only thing she needs
Won't take pity on her cries
I'd better keep it to the hard line
Call me ruthless, call me cruel
But I'm convinced of what I do

The wicked anti-female
The pretty girl's nightmare
The throat cutting insane
Is on his feet again

Can't take 'em, don't need 'em
Can't even stand to see 'em
The way they smell
The way they talk
I really hate the way they walk

The blade is back
