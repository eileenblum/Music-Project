Caged into the chopper
Crossing the green
Camouflage confusing his eyes
His company down under
Shots from nowhere
Loyalty'll be denied in time

Followed the call of pride
Patriotic to fight for stars and stripes
Heroic left his home
To invade a land
Where he doesn't belong

Agent orange cleared his sight now
A different face stared at him somehow
Gas changed the conflict
Sort of deranged
Hope and honour
Have fallen with the green

Deprived of the green filter
No more cruelties censored
War can't be ignored any longer
Wishes he was out of sight again

The green is gone
Shelter's slain
The hidden heroes
Delivered to the pain
It's in his face
Where they run, where they fall
It's in his mind
Unable to close the scar
Heroic image uncovered
Escaping from it's challenging disguise

Into the green
Into the green
Where mortality's unseen
Into the green
Where war games are so easy to play

Soon it was done
The hell of Vietnam
Unveiled it's violated grace
His company down under
Strategic demands
Raged like a tropic disease

It's been hard to watch 'em die
Trying to forget Operation My Lai
Though he didn't really mind
To hear some Viet Cong's women cry

Agent orange cleared his sight now
Loyalty was kicked away somehow
Turned the chopper
Left the violence
Into the green
Where war is as once

Deprived of the green filter
No more cruelties censored
War can't be ignored any longer
Wishes he was out of sight again

Into the green
Into the green
Where mortality's unseen
Into the green
Where bravery's what it means

Invisible, in the green
