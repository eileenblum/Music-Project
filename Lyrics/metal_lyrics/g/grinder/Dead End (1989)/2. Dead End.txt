Don't leave me waiting
Open the door
Never felt like this before
I guess that death has scored
So help me
Get me off the floor
Slowly moving clearing the place
Ain't nobody see you and me
Invisible in the streets
No one to hold me
I'm leaving here

At the edge of nowhere
At the ruins of myself
At the crack of light
Where being's finished
End of time
One step to eternity
An inch from reality
One thought from decay
While living seems so far away

Charons been already payed
Crossing the liquid end of fate
Won't take long to pass the gate
Dimensions fade but I feel the rain
Guess I'm deprived of vitality
In physical lethargy
No more being no more pain
No body, to feel an ache

At the edge of nowhere
At the ruins of myself
At the crack of light
Where being's finished
End of time
One step to eternity
An inch from reality
One thought from decay
While living seems so far away

Welcome to the cold
Welcome to a cold world
Welcome to your grave
Welcome to the lost souls eternity
At the dead end of light
At the dead end of time
Into the nightmare
Depression fills
My empty head
Terribly lonely, it's myself
That's killing me
Abandoned, kind of sad
Some empty shell, kind of dead
The silence of the big sleep
Some pounding noise inside of me

Life, turned to a kind of being
With shadows sitting by my side
My hands are cold as ice
Is this myself inside

No one to talk to
Nothing to long for anymore
A grey dimension out of reason
Out of nature
No individual, not a face
In fictive mirrors
Mute, out of thought and sight
Deaf, blind and paralyzed

Life, turned to a kind of being
With shadows sitting by my side
My hands are cold as ice
Is this myself inside

Life, turned to a kind of being
With shadows sitting by my side
My hands are cold as ice
Is this myself inside

At the dead end of time
Dead end of light
Dead end of time
Dead end of light
Dead end of life
