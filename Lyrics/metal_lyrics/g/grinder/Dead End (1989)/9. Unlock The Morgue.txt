Here they lie
Cold side by side
Sometimes in the dark aisles
I notice someone opened his eyes
Observe their veins
Pumping some liquid to brains
Dead hearts mute
But there's life running through
Listen, hear them whisper
Through lips still closed
But there's some words stuttered
Right out of dried up rotten throats
Limbs in convulsion
Quaking partitions
Nothing to keep 'em asleep
Their hearts start to beat
The dead are alive

Forgotten by absorption by the night
Undead reeling on the edge of life
Reach to be delivered
Hungry for the big sleep
Desperate searching for the door ahead
Still they're blind and damned
Some helpless crawl
This is not their world

Assassinating truth
They lurk behind you
Dead within the waste of life
Schizophrenic awakened the vision
Their blood is cold
The fear is gone
Am I dead or am I dreaming
Are these living or lies
Force is growing, no resistance
Unlock the morgue
Spread the dark

Surround me
Hit me with an empty gaze
Hatred expression of a rotten face
Eat me with your eyes
Subtle piece of life
Lost, abandoned from reality
Tear me to share eternity
Beyond the earth
This is not their world

Assassinating truth
They lurk behind you
Dead within the waste of life
Schizophrenic awakened the vision
Their blood is cold
The fear is gone
Am I dead or am I dreaming
Are these living or lies
Force is growing, no resistance
Unlock the morgue
Spread the dark

Hypnosis, entering the floor
Guide their souls through the door
Whispering unnamed
Death is still untamed
To give the lost
The only that they need

Unchained the dead
Escaping from their cage
Defenseless cities
Gonna bleed from their rage
Where reality's torn apart
Is where the nightmares start
Unreal, is it what it seems to be
Some vision of some personal insanity
Damnation takes its course
This is not their world

Assassinating truth
They lurk behind you
Dead within the waste of life
Schizophrenic awakened the vision
Their blood is cold
The fear is gone
Am I dead or am I dreaming
Are these living or lies
Force is growing, no resistance
Unlock the morgue
Spread the dark
