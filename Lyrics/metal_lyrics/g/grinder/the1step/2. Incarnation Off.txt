You might spill the blood of the symptoms
But you'll never catch the soul of the cause
You might spill the blood of the symptoms
But you'll never catch the soul of the cause
You - you might hang a lot of the threatenings captured
But are you sure? - Is the virus really cured?
Violate - exterminate
You'll never gonna dominate
THE BEAST; THE WHORE; THE DEVIL
Do your best to detect the infected
THE BEAST; THE WHORE; THE DEVIL
You're raging blind and slay some selected
THE BEAST; THE WHORE; THE DEVIL
DROWN YOU IN A BARREL OF LIES
THE BEAST; THE WHORE; THE DEVIL
Are laughing at the dying...
The blood of the symptoms
The unfortunates ash
The reasons keep on being untouched...
There ain't no
Sunshine
To dry up the bloodyard..
THE JUDGE; THE TRIAL; THE GALLOWS
There's a lot more necks to break
THE JUDGE; THE TRIAL; THE GALLOWS
There are plenty of life's left to take
THE JUDGE; THE TRIAL; THE GALLOWS
Trying to conquer the evil in mankind
THE JUDGE; THE TRIAL; THE GALLOWS
There ain't no rope to hand 'em high enough...

[Chorus]

Blasphemy, mortality
Agony death penalty disturbing the tranquillity
Anarchy, inner enemy
Anger and morbidity completing instability
[repeat]

Violate! - VIOLATE...
Beast, whore and devil,
Beast, whore and devil,
Judge, trial and gallows
Judge, trial and gallows
Beast, whore and devil,
Beast, whore and devil,
Violate! - VIOLATE...
