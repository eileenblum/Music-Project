The way you look at me
The way you turn me on
The way you make me feel
Is the way you make me sick...

Hey people -
Look into the mirror

Do you think you look
Different than me?
Hey fuckers
If you think you're smarter
I call you...
Nerds! Suckers!

Well dressed
Symbol of society
You nerd symbol of success
Stop picking your fucking nose
Mom's calling you to come home

Hey people -
Look into the mirror
Do you think you look
Different than me?
Hey fuckers
If you think you're smarter
I call you...
Nerds! Suckers!

Sucker, fucker
Suck off and die!
Fuck off and die!
