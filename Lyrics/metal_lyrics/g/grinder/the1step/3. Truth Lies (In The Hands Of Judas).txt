Forbidden deeds might be alright - tomorrow
When to live when to die
No one knows
Where to stay what to say
How to move
How to feel how to behave
What to do - but how could you know?

[Pre-chorus:]
Wash your hand in innocence
You're morally responsible for your sins
I'm the conscience
I'm the norm
I'm the sentence...

[Chorus:]
Life is full of doubts
Truth lies in the hands of Judas
Existence's never sure
Truth lies in the hands of Judas...

Cry for what you believed...
You're getting used to your lies
Perpetual denial
A little wondered not afraid
About the disguise
Obeying the new order
Simply - minded
Honour and betrayal
Hard to divide
But how could you know?

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

TRUTH LIES!
TRUTH LIES!
TRUTH LIES!
...In the hands of Judas...

[Repeat 1st verse]

Wash your hands in innocence
You're morally responsible for your sins
I'm the conscience
I'm the norm
I'm the sentence...

Wash your hands in innocence
You're morally responsible for your sins
I'm your conscience, I'm your norm
I'm YOUR JUDAS...
