Listen people what can I say?
I'm a really fucked up personality
You know I'm hangin' around all day and night
With my body pretty busy though my mind is tired
Picking up the phone to give my friends a call
But I didn't pay the bill so it won't work at all
I've got the muddiest burgers and the cheapest booze
A bunch of pills but nothin' else to consume...

[Chorus:]
Reeling on the edge, reeling on the edge
I'm full time stoned and I'm half time dead,
Reeling on the edge, reeling on the edge
How should I dare another step?
...I'm afraid someone's gonna push me just a little too far...
...can't get rid of the fear they won't open the door for me...

I'm not used to stuff to read
What should I learn from books or stupid magazines?
Walkin' through the park watchin' open air TV
Witness violation entertainment for free
Children rob their mother's robbers keep on robbin' joggers
Thank God no one's gonna rob me cause I've got a lot of brothers
But maybe I just need another try...

[Chorus]

Fuck!
Listen to me!
Kicked in the teeth again
But I won't lose my head
If I could only have the chance...
I don't need no charity
But I can't cope with enmity
As long as I'm sitting in the pit!

I'M ALONE
Fighting a 1000 feet trying to kick me down
I CAN'T TAKE
People being all the time so sorry 'bout my fate
I'M NOT A FOOL
As long as I'm me and do not have to think like you
I'M ALIVE
I'm a living personality that cannot be denied
I'M ALIVE
I'M ALIVE
I'M ALIVE
I'm alive!
