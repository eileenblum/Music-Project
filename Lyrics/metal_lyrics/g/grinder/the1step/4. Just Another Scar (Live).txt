You don't belong, you don't belong
In the world of today,
Nothing you do, nothing you say
Will cause any change,
One single fate, one single fate
Won't be missed in this state,
That's all you are, that's all you'll be
And there's nothing you'll leave;

Just another scar within the skin,
A tiny trip of blood upon a pin,
Another crack within the wall,
Just another leaf to fall;
Just another tear within the sea,
Another day of the year,
Another person within the crowd,
Not even worth to care about;

Another scar - another wound
A handful of dust to pour into the tomb;
Some new disease -
Some different death
Just another hole within the flesh;

[Chorus]

Another sentence - brand new law
Again equality picked the shortest straw;
Another highjack - another riot
An armed third world,
Another mercenary hired;
This is the world you live in,
This is existence -
This is the cycle of the strong
And the weak;
The nature of the wolf
To beat the sheep;
So keep being brave but quiet -
And be satisfied...

You don't belong, you don't belong
In the world of today,
Nothing you do, nothing you say
Will cause any change,
One single fate, one single fate
Won't be missed in this state,
That's all you are, that's all you'll be
And there's nothing you'll leave

But another scar,
Just another scar...
