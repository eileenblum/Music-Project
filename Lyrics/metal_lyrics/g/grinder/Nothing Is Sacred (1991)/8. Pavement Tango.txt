I've got the beat
I've got the booze
There's no one doin' the limbshake
As fucked up as I do
My way of jerkin' round
Is kind of unique in town
But what I'm really proud of
Is my unmolested top ten breakdown

Do the pavement tango
The heroin pogo
Do the needle mambo
Everybody in the whole damn ghetto
Do the pavement tango
The heroin pogo
Do the needle mambo

Sister sells her pussy
To afford herself a trip
Around the clock on duty
She won't find a plug to fit
Casual urge to defecate
Pretty under control
Itching heels, tattering hips
Waitin' for gettin' balled
