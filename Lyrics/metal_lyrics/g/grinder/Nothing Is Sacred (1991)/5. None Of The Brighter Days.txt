Seconds, minutes, hours
Keep on passing by my desperate self
Depressing black and white
No touch of grey to paint my shell
No sequence to the synthetic smiles
That reach my staring, empty eyes
Half asleep no motivation
To push me to activity

None of the brighter days to come in time
None of the brighter days to light my life

The mirror shows the undead scheme
Of a fractured personality
Silence and tranquility
The only friends I have
No amount of drinks enough
To reach the edge of happiness
None of my memories
Are worth enough to fill my dreams

Never more, never cry
Never laugh, never die
Never lucky, never sad
Never normal, never mad
Loneliness, abandonment
Decay of mind, desperation
Depressive boredom
Depressive life
Depressive me
Depressive time

None of the brighter days to come in time
None of the brighter days to light my life
