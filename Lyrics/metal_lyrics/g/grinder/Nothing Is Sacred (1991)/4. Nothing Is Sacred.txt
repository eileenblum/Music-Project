We're mean enough to tell the truth
We're mad enough to fuck with you
Nothing's holy in business cruel
Nothing's sacred to us too
Extreme enough to reach your minds
Sure, this is kind of suicide
Nothing's holy in business cruel
Nothing's sacred to us too

You're pretty smart
You're pretty cool
You know better than all of the fools
Got lots of friends
Opinion sucks
As long as they feed your butt with bucks
Strange thing
People lickin' your shoes
Play much better than others do
Are you really objective
Or just havin' a laugh?
It's a matter of taste
Not a matter of cash

May we suck your dicks
Or kiss your asses?
No one needs success like that
Who do you think you are?
All of the guys are working hard
Sweat and tears, it took lots of time
All broke down when you wrote those lines
All that bullshit will never be missed
Fuck that business
Let the music live

Nothing is sacred
Nothing is sacred
Nothing is sacred
To us too
