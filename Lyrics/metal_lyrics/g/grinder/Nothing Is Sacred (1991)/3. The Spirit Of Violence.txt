Suddenly you feel it
Your senses gettin' torn
Adrenalin shooting
Arteries seem to boil
Nervous, angry
Staring through a red lens
Interior gladiator's just slain your defense

The root of all disgusting
The godfather of sin
Meet me in the depths of mind
And let the game begin
Assassinate your conscience
My turned apostate friend
Incestuous brotherhood of souls
Control me if you can

The reborn me is threatening myself
Can't reach for where the slaughter dwells
My guts are frozen
My blood's like ice
Interior gladiator spreading the cold inside
