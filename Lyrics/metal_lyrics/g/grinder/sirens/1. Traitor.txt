Free his Blood
From it`s Chain
Pay your Tribute
To the Insane -
Burn - The Torch of Hate
To feed - The Fire of Pain ...
For War he calls
His Friends would fall
Well die - Live by live
As long as he`s laughing at our Side ...

[Chorus:]
Feel the Power
The Hate of his Game
The poisoned Life blood
Run through his Veins
Slave to the Pleasure
To follow his Creed
A Mind cold as Ice
Traitor will rage tonight ...

Traitors came
Shocked the World
Voices of warning
Never been heard
You knew his aim - He just declared
But you never dared - to say a Word
Writhing in Anger
More - give us more
Enslave us - Cheat us - on and on

[Chorus 2x]

Rage tonight
Rage tonight
