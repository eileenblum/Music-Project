My rebirth has granted me new eyes in order to confirm my species lives. This is my oath to exterminate the human race from valleys to the skies. From creation to revelation now ultimate eradication.

Plague

The blood lust in the air keeps me motivated, the very crust of the earth now separated. They develop hollow hope in their sedation I am immune due to my mutilations. The blood lust in the air keeps me motivated, the blood lust in the air keeps me motivated. I excel to the last sign of life.
I exterminate this race with satisfied eyes.
