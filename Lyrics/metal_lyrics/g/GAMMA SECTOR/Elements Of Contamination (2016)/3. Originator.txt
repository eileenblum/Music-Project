I was created through the most putrid womb of filth.
Research begins
I become destruction. I feel power running through every fiber that is me increasing my chance to finally be free.

I am the catalyst (I am the catalyst)

I spend hours striking and the chamber finally falters. I emerge to unfamiliar experience a piercing wave. Infecting my mind I spiral into a frenzied state my senses finally awaken.
I circumvent security, I long to be the one to leech. Every drop as you writhe and bleed lurking in darkness in between.

I reach my target and wait for the perfect opportunity. I have paved a path to guarantee my legacy this step is the shortest yet this is most important.

As I smile cheek to cheek and as I watch this monster bleed. I realize I've rewarded this entire planet, as I smile cheek to cheek and as I watch this monster bleed. I realize I've rewarded this entire planet.

Father, bastard, traitor. Father, bastard, traitor.

I circumvent security, I long to be the one to leech. Every drop as you writhe and bleed lurking in darkness in between. I reach my target and wait for the perfect opportunity.
