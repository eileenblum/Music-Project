I am no man nor am I a monster. I am torment, I want nothing but disaster. I plan my prey become the hunter yet everyday the obsession grows stronger. A crimson flow under a dusking sky all innocence in sight is set aside. For a single night of ending a wasted life.

I'll bring this world back into the light only justice resides in death.
So now that I've felt my first urges I've set to fulfill them with quickness. Striving for the one thing that I want, finding amusement in your run. Infection spreads throughout your brain. No cure for a nucleic plague humanity will not be saved.

I am no man nor am I monster I am torment, I want nothing but disaster. I plan my prey become the hunter yet everyday the obsession grows stronger.
A crimson flow under a dusking sky all innocence in sight is set aside.

For a single night of ending a wasted life I'll bring this world back into the light. Now I have you right where I want you. If you think it'll help just close your eyes.

I am no man nor am I a monster, I am torment, I want nothing but disaster.
I plan my prey become the hunter yet everyday the obsession grows stronger. This is pure decimation. A cruel display of contamination.
