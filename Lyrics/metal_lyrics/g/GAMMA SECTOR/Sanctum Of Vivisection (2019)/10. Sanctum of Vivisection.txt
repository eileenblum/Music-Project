I object
For you wish to abuse
The power I have granted you
I curse these lands and any soul that stands by them

The way is shut.
It was made
By those who are dead
And the dead keep it.
And the dead keep it.
The way is shut.

Seen before by a prophet
Which you failed to recognize
All the visions sought for nothing
All the visions sought for nothing

For you wish to abuse
The power I have granted you
I curse these lands and any soul that stands by them

[Dickie Allen of Infant Annihilator:]
Blinded by light
Deafened by the screams of the damned
The sanctum consumes what I once was
My soul added to the unholy collective
Locked behind the ancient walls
I scour the halls
Locked behind the ancient walls
I scour the halls

I can't help but cry
At the pitiful sight
Before my eyes
They starve for power
They thirst for attention
Seeking something
Finding nothing
Seeking something
To make them happy
