We are molded together
By fate and mutual need
For knowledge and power
For our goal we will bleed

Lured in, our realm
Your personal hell
Catch your breath
We just want you dead
We only need your death

Founded by similar disposition
To the night mother we give submission
We've built this collective to will her decisions
It seems our goals are finally coming to fruition
It seems our goals are finally coming to fruition

We are molded together
By fate and mutual need
For knowledge and power
For our goal we will bleed

Blessed upon us to carry out
This world will see her power
Give thanks and kneel
The conditions sealed
All your burdens be healed

We just want you dead
