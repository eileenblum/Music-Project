I can't comprehend silhouettes in size
The trunks age right before my eyes
I'm lost, what can I do
Unfamiliar shapes and hues

The terror eats at my mind
I can't escape this feeling

It feels my flesh should flake away
Like petals from the roses
Like leaves from the trees

Is it just my mind or is it something more
The frost cuts through my feet like shards of ice

I can't help but fear myself
Is something out to get me

[Dave Simonich of Signs of the Swarm:]
Tormented by these delusions
I can't help but to fear myself
My mind at harvest
Like the wilted rose

Bound to this desolation
True decay, true pain
Death release this hell
Fearing what I am, I fear myself

Tormented by these foul delusions
I can't help but to fear myself
Like the wilted rose
Bound to this desolation
True decay, true pain
I've come to fear myself
