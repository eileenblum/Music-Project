As I trek through the trees
Branches creak out to me
The once heavenly body
Serving as a satellite
Our moon, our beacon of light
Is blooded tonight
Though I only see through the gaps in the leaves
I sense the horror that awaits me

I hear you there
Footsteps and signals shared
As I walk bundled in cloth and fear
I feel you proceeding to gather near Grasping at my skin
Rasping in my ear
Yet you never appear

My vision clears but only for a moment
Upon my arrival
I face the cathedral
Blinded by light
Deafened by the screams of the damned

My panicked mind has betrayed me
I scream to the heavens yet there is no mercy
The sanctum consumes what I once was
My soul added to the unholy collective
Locked behind the ancient walls

Upon my arrival
I face the cathedral
Blinded by light
Deafened by the screams of the damned
