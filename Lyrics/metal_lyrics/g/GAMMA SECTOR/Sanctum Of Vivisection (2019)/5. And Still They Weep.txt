Engulfed in the pool of suffering
Their call for help concealed
The weight of death smothering me
Anguish is all I feel

They cry for peace

Knowing it will be ignored
And still they weep
A writhing mass, a pitiful horde

Despondent
Forlorn
Abhorrent
No more

Our only hope, putting our trust in
A mirage of a savior's choice
To cleanse us of our corruption
Lost in songs of rejoice

They sink down to their former state
Even worse than before

Knowing it will be ignored
And still they weep
A writhing mass, a pitiful horde

They cry for peace
They weep
