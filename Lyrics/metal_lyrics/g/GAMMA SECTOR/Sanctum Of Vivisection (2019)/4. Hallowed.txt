Choking as the spirit leaves

Choking as the spirit leaves
My aura drained from me
Scratching at my eyes
My lungs subside
The sky looks down
Laughing at my cries

My soul ventures forth
Reaching back to me
My chest holds no home
My head holds no memory

Lifeless my former shell lies
Left in the snow, left to die
So I walk forward towards the front steps
As my body takes it's last breath

A weight lifted, feeling so free now
My perception shifted, I see how
How I got here, the mistakes I've made
The overwhelming fear, of being betrayed

The sky looks down
Laughing at my cries

Scratching at my eyes
My lungs subside
Left to die

My soul ventures forth
Reaching back to me
My chest holds no home
My head holds no memory
