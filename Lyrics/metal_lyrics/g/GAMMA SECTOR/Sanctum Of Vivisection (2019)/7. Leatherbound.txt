Awakened
Straps at my hands and feet
Rubbing my skin raw
Making my flesh bleed

Needles digging deep into me
Their contents tricking my psyche
How can this be?
With everything I've seen

Was it all a lie
How can I trust my sight
Was it all a lie

In walk my captors
Filling the room with laughter
They provide no answers
Only more mystery nothing to gather

No sign of escape
Bound to a slab
No sign of escape
Bound to a slab
Bound to a slab by leather
No sign of escaping

Awakened
Straps at my hands and feet
Rubbing my skin raw
Making my flesh bleed
Awakened
Straps at my hands and feet
Rubbing my skin raw
Making my flesh bleed

Needles digging deep
Tricking my psyche
