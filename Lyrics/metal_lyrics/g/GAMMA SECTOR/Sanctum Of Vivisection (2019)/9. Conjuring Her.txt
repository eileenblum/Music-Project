The air reeks of sulfur
Wandering eyes
Nailed to the altar
Circling flies
Beckon your brothers
Call to the skies
Where crows parade like vultures
They sing of sacrifice

Annihilate the body, extinguish the soul
Fires of sacrifice burn through the coals
Slicing my palm, crushing the leaves
The blood oozing out of my hands as I squeeze

Words of sin
Bring a gust of wind
An unholy force
Reaching deeper within

They sing of sacrifice

You will be denied of salvation
Doomed to eternal damnation

Fall to your knees
Bow before me
Bow before me

Words of sin
Reaching deeper within
An unholy force
How did it come to this

You will be denied of salvation
Doomed to eternal damnation

Annihilate the body, extinguish the soul
Fires of sacrifice burn through the coals
Fires of sacrifice burn through the coals

Slicing my palm, crushing the leaves
The blood oozing from my hands as I squeeze
The blood oozing from my hands as I squeeze
