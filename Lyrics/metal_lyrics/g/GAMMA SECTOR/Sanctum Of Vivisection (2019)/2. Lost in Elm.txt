Tracks in the snow
Mark the tragic journey
Bit by the cold
As the moon's phase is turning

Dead leaves crunch under feet
Leaving a state of peace
Echoing darkness
Losing sight
Losing light

Reaching behind, an abundance of hands
An effort to prevent this lonely soul
From meeting a familiar fate

The pleads
Lost in elm
Turn back
Leave this realm

The smell of freedom
The taste of imprisonment
Hangs in the air

Winds howl
Spirits scowl
Upon the mortal trespassing their sacred lands
The smell of freedom
The taste of imprisonment
Hangs in the air
Like the fog clinging to the trees
The moon red above
Bleeding through the leaves

Like the fog clinging to the trees
The moon red above
Bleeding through the leaves
