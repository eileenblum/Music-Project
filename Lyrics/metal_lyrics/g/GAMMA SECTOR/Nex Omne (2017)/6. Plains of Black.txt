Human skin wrapped around an alien frame
Doomed to walk this
Earth, you will die without shame
For you had no purpose, you had no aim
Everything that you forged destroyed in endgame
This planet was begging, pleading
This planet was begging, pleading
To be purified, to be purified
To be purified, to be purified
To be purified
When the ground starts to quake and the world begins to break
A broken mass it will forever remain
Princeps universe
The land rotting, plains of black
Decay spreading through the cracks
Decay spreading through the cracks
Decay spreading through the cracks
The universe dreading the path that this planetâs heading
For you had no purpose, you had no aim
Everything that you forged destroyed in endgame
Iâm coming for your throat
This planet was begging
This planet was begging
May my efforts complete me as
I complete them
