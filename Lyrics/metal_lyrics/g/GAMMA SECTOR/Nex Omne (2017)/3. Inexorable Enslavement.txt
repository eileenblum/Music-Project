[feat. Lucca Schmerler of Mental Cruelty]We've been infiltrated
From as long as I can remember
My kind has been the defenders of our planet and its species
But the time has come to surrender
Or this planet will enter a state of internal bleeding
A sea of eternal seeking
Eternal seeking for safety and refuge
Oddities begin to show
Nightmares begin to grow
In my mind in our homes
Nightmares begin to grow
Contorted
Everyone discordant
Distorted
Contorted
Darkened skies emerge on the horizon of the day
A realignment of my mind leads me to this compliant state
An urge to obey
I just cannot shake
A shadow shrouding over the congregation
A light lingers on the on the surface of our faces
Rising closer to our purpose
The final convergence
Psyches pierced and filled with fear
The will to live not present here
No longer leaders darkened skies emerge on the horizon of day
A realignment of my mind leads me to this compliant state
An urge to obey
I just cannot shake
They appear in the atmosphere
Useless effort interferes with victory to save our peers
The best engineers to make demands clear

[Lucca Schmerler:]
Slaves, chains
We are doomed
We are damned
How could we have not seen this earlier?
Once a peaceful civilization
Now a hostile, spiteful nation
