[feat. Dan Watson of Enterprise Earth/Infant Annihilator][I. Light]

The fuel of the planet can no longer withstand
This is the faltering bodyâs final stand
As it burns out it transmits the darkness
As gravity pulls the sphere, the crust finally forfeits
Contractions of the core
The planetary nebula begins
To pour from the pores
A dead future lies in stone
It changes from white to black
Then drains out to nothing more
The last trace in space is light years away
A foreshadowing of death to any life in the way
As all light is replaced by darkness and hate
The amusement floods my brain
There will be no life to remember this day
I have obtained the power to destroy and create
The bringer of night, eraser of day
The fuel of the planet can no longer withstand
This is the bodyâs final stand
As it burns out it transmits the darkness supernova
Collapses into the neutron star
Devourer of light and the life it brings
Exterminate light
Exterminate life

[II. Life]

The second chapter beings
I will smite this entire universe
For it is filled with sin you will bow and bend
To the rules of the ancients
One life ending, brings the beginning
The soul descending the sacrifice now ascending beyond mending
The death of this entity slaughtering enemies
Miasma of rotting flesh
The atmosphere reeks of death
This extraterrestrial loss of life

[Dan Watson:]
Organic substance will expire, expose the flesh of fire
I will purge the universe of this curse
Malignant parasites repopulate and reproduce
Their endless appetites feed on the world that they populate
Prometheus will watch you burn in the fire he gave you
Your god wonât save you because he answers to me
I will erase every living thing
Their breath will be squeezed from their choking lungs
Spewing forsaken blood their death beliefs
Their bulging eyes look upon their creator as he turns his back on another failed creation
