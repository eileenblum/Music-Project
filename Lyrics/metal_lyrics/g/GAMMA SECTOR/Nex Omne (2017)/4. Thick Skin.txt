I toy with the victims
Enjoy then
I trick them
Implants pierce the thick skin
Restriction within them
Nightmares commence this unfair suspense
I'm ready for control my patience growing thin
They drop like flies under a black sun
The darkening of skies on the horizon
Their function and will shall cease
A step forward to fulfill this prophecy
No longer a nightmare
This is reality
They drop like flies under a black sun
As I break through the walls of their minds
Their souls will be as foretold by the signs
The darkening of skies on the horizon
With empty sight they organize the structure
Chains lay at their sides as they further the scripture
Dried out eyes and severed tongues, individuals no longer
A savior among the soulless kind
A savior among the soulless kind
Severed tongues and dried out eyes
Severed tongues and dried out eyes
Severed tongues and dried out eyes
