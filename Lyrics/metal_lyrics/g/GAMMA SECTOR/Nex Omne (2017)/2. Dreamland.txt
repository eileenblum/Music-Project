We have multiplied, we have taken flight
We are hidden in darkened skies
We carry tools to render minds
You will succumb to the light
You will hear their feet stomp
As they march towards justice
They will come to us
We shall arrive superior minds
Discreet mutilations performed as if we were upon cattle
Besiege the inhabitants
Absorb the energy
We will create a Dreamland
Dream
Tranquilizers take over nervous systems
This is mere abduction in my hands
This is a dream being fulfilled upon your land
Let them rot away, the highest divine
Emerge with the signs to deliver our will
Let them rot away overwhelmed to obey
To fill this planet with decay
