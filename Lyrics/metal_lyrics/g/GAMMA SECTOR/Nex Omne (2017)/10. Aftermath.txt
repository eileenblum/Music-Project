[feat. Jimmy Harrington]So as we deserve the destruction
Debris infected with deathly corruption
Spheres disappear with spontaneous combustion
Hear the sound of fear, halt all production
Focus is aimed at stopping this plan
Light years away he stretches his hands
Planetary removing hatred swallowing, engulfing
I rip through layers of crust erasing one by one
As the ashes of this tragic ending invade the air
Behold erosion
Planetary removing hatred
Swallowing, engulfing, eraser
Every planet now reduced
To rubble and nothing more
To rubble and nothing more
To rubble and nothing more
To rubble and nothing more
So as we observe the destruction
Debris infected with deadly corruption
Spheres disappear with spontaneous combustion
Hear the sound of fear, halt all production
Halt all production cores are crushed in
Planets all around gone, nothing to trust in
Leaving worlds haunted the ancient one taunted
A foreshadowed messaged of imminent judgement
A first impression the hive-mind adjusted
The last step of a vision to destroy something
Something once beautiful corrupted
Something once beautiful corrupted
Something once beautiful corrupted
Something once beautiful corrupted

[Jimmy Harrington:]
Every conscience is blind to the selfishness
Of the obsession of planetary isolation
The bleeding obsession with falsification
Oh, so the revocation begins
I've waited eternity to bring it to an end
This is just the beginning
Of the universe brought to its knees
Contrary to belief life and death will meet

I'm ending existence as far as the eye can see
Life and death shall meet
Life and death shall meet
Life and death shall meet
Life and death shall meet
