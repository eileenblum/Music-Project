Nex Omne
In quo de creatione hominis,
Per quos morte eius fuit machinator.
Reliquis in universo,
Et adduxerunt ad odium
Sepultus est in tenebris,
Nex Omne.

[English translation:]

Universal Death
Wherein the creation of man,
By whom his demise was engineered.
Against the remaining universe,
Brought his hate to bear
By dark matter interred,
Universal Death.
