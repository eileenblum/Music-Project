In one moment we see the beautiful fall of everything created
This great void feeds on anything once its been weighed in
Souls encased in shells that paralyze
Blackened haze enshrouds from the outside
Deep in the belly of the beast the seed has been waiting to hatch
Death now opens its jaws wide â unblinkingly staring all in the eyes
Every trace of withered matter rendered
Helpless, hopeless, mortified
Helpless, hopeless, mortified
Darkness fills presence
Complete pit of onyx
It laughs until you've died
Filled with fear and past tense cries
Petrified for the rest of time
Set to dine on the light inside
Compelling all eyes to be locked in its gaze
Never to return from this mass spacial grave
The banks of space, littered with carcasses and tragic fate
Death begins to eat its fill
From the skies, from the ground
Dragging existence down
Death is the strongest form of will
Now gorging itself
Nothing that lives can deny what it must consume
This world falls silent
Stare into the void of ruination
It welcomes you
Nothing that lives can deny what it must consume
Nothing that lives can deny what it must consume
In one moment we see the beautiful fall of everything created
This great void feeds on anything once its been weighed in
Souls encased in shells that paralyze
Blackened haze enshrouds from the outside
The banks of space, littered with carcasses and tragic fate
Death opens its jaws wide

As worlds fall silent
Stare into the void of ruination
It welcomes you
