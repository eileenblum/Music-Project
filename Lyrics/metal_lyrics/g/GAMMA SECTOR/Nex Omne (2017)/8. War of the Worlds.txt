[feat. Rheese Peters of A Night In Texas]Distorted gravity directed at the enemy
As the body grows closer
As my core grows colder
The atmospheres collide crushing all remaining life
Entombed in ice
The atmospheres collide crushing all remaining life
Entombed in ice
Distant disintegration
A global reduction of all land and oceans
As the ice shatters
The barren
Earth is revealed once more
Only to endure complete annihilation
Magma seeping from the very inner core
The blue planet near extinction

[Rheese Peters:]
These two celestial bodies
Now resemble each other
Red, barren and broken to their cores
Washed over by liquid flame
Just before they crack and begin to break
Their skies will be black for days
As all life on
Earth suffocates
A war of the worlds on a cataclysmic scale
An end so grand neither planet can be remade
Now watch as they begin to wane
No more oxygen, no more hope for anything to remain
Only destruction, both planets will now be replaced
By nothing but dust and debris, death and decay
All chance for organic life has been erased
