Every single surface on this crimson planet is serving the purpose
Of bearing the broadcast of this divulgence
Revealing
Convergence
You'll bring assistance without any conscience
There's no coexistence you'll erase the distance
The last of resistance was ripped from existence
The planets persistent to merge in an instant
Subservient to a cause now clear
Everyone working planetary gear
From a "leader" they thought they'd never fear
Permeant whispers of death that is near
The early ancestor that resides here
Can only watch in horror
As the species disappear
Perceptions change
How could we believe?
How could we trust?
How could we trust?
I now realize we brought upon this onslaught
You'll bring assistance without any conscience
There's no coexistence you'll erase the distance
The last of resistance was ripped from existence
The planets persistent to merge in an instant
