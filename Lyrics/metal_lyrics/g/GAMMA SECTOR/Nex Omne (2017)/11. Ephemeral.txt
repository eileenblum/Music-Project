[feat. Ben Duerr, Matt Perrin &amp; Duncan Bentley]I'll have him as he gloats
While I wait
I practice on less honorable throats
Their eyes turn heavenward
As I slice their juggulars
We will fill the atmosphere with the utmost fear
The apex is here
The universe's direction was lost now found
When this battle is won you will be shut down
You won't hear the slightest sound as
Your legacy falls to the ground
I deliver the final blow, now the galaxy will know
Your death will serve as a prophet of this declaration of obliteration
We are ancients
Regicide
Oh, but you have forgotten the power I hold
You have underestimated the abomination of this universe

[Ben Duerr:]
Blasphemic martyr
I demand your valueless life to cease
Ageless treachery
A deathless essence escaping mortality
Majesty incomparable apart from those who fall at my feet
Agonizing eradication abides unto your destiny
Relinquish your power
Lay down your soul you must answer to me
Despot deluging, engulfed in flames of defeat
Blasphemic martyr, your corpse intended for meat

[Duncan Bentley:]
I embody all you see this universe abides by me
Don't you understand by killing me you'll bring on eternal non-existence
This galaxy will decay as the stars fall from the sky
Worlds collide
There's no use in fucking running this universe will die
The knife slices his throat as this universe bleeds
No, how can this be?

My legacy
Forsaken lifeless eyes gaze upon a universe devoid of life
