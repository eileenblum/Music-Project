World Demise
Last Breath Of Life
There's Nothin' More But You
All The Buried Seasons In War
This Vision Can't Be True
After Many Years Of Rage
What Have You Realized?
Hundred, Thousand, Millions
Only Numbers For Your Pride!

You Are The Last In Line
No Way To Run Or Hide
You'll Pay This Genocide
Come In The Underworld

Now It's Time To Judge The Crimes
Brutal Sounds It's On You
Set The Torture, It's Not A Fiction
At All Will Be So Smooth
In Your Life Too Many Lies
The Main World Is Always Hate
This Is Underworld Empire
It's Not The Other Side

You Are The Last In Line
No Way To Run Or Hide
You'll Pay This Genocide
Come In The Underworld

In The Blue Light, We Pretend To Know
Why This World Must Be So Grey And Cold
No More Gloom Refuge And Not Deceit
Nature Will Avenge And All Their Breed

You Are The Last In Line
No Way To Run Or Hide
You'll Pay This Genocide
Come In The Underworld
