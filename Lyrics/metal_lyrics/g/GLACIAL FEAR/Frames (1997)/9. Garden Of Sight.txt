Master, Help Me
Tell Me, Am I Upset?
Macabre Machine
Luggage Of My Loveless

All Around Secret Shadows,
In A Lake Full Of Hate
Time Is Going Fast,
My Holy Garden, My Fate

Cradle, Decoy
Defect, Will I Obey?
Robber In Lust And Flesh,
Image And Hades

When The Sun And The Planet Moon
Will Together Arise
Draped Of Silent Hunter
I Will Ponder Again

I'm Blind, I'm Blind, Tide
Killed By Time In The Scrub
In This Hell Of Life

Tears Of Despair
Laugh I Betray
Dreaming, Suffering
Drowned In Pain

All Around There Are Still Shadows
Am I Lonely Again?
Night And Darkness Veils
I'm In Charge Again

I'm Blind, I'm Blind, Tide
Killed By Time In The Scrub
In This Hell Of Life

I'm Dreaming Myself Alive
I'm A Swindler Prince
Shattering Alone
Across Tears And Despair
And This Law I Betray
And My Sin Crucified,
For Reasons Which I Don't Know Why

In This Garden Of Sight
I'm Blind, In This Garden Of Sight

We Have Saved The Best For Last
But I'm Still Here
I Should Run, Run More Than Fast
Though This Passage Corrupted
'Til The Future, 'Til Past

Master, Help Me
Tell Me, Am I Upset?
Macabre Machine
Luggage Of My Loveless

All Around Secret Shadows,
In A Lake Full Of Hate
Time Is Going Fast,
My Holy Garden, My Fate

I'm Blind, I'm Blind, Tide
Killed By Time In The Scrub
In This Hell Of Life

Pointed Heart, You Bare
Deadly Pale
Obfuscated Object
A Quarrel Maze
Pointed Heart, You Bare
Deadly Pale
Obfuscated Object
A Quarrel Maze

I'm Blind, Blind, Tide
Killed By Time In The Scrub
In This Hell Of Life
Still Blind, Blind, Tide
Dead And Alive
Out In This Life
