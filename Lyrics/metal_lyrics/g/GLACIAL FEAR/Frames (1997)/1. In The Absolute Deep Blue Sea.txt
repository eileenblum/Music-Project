Livid Waters We're Wasting Away
On The Old World Of My Vessel
While That Wave, After Wave
Was Breakin' The Nocturne Infinite Blue

A Queen Tall And Thin
Of Violet Veils Worn
With Hair Of Pale Corn
Hovered Erect!

Toward Mine Coordinates
Without Frictions Preventing Her
While The Sun Upon The Sea
Was Throwing Its Splitting Rays

Crystal Of Refracted Light
We're Reflected On The Smooth Surface
Of The Ice, At The Horizon
I Saw A Siren

Incite Me To Fight
Against His Wind

What Do You Want
What Are You Looking For
What Do You Want
What Are You Looking For
You'll Grovel Again
Down The Oceanic Sand
To Search Shining Stones
To Hide Crying Eyes

Castaway
After A Night And A Day
Castaway
After A Night And A Day
At Last I Saw The Coast
But It Was Only
A New Beginning
To Be The Absolute...
