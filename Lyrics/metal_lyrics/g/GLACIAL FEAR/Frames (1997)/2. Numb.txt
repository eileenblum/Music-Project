Borin' Days In Failure
Makes Me Feel So Wrong
Something Strange I Would Suppose
Lead Me Wretched Life
Even If I Watch The Sky
There's No Place To Rest
Drop By Drop Deliver
Out Of Time I'm Dim

Capturin' The Daylight
Please Let Me Disappear
If Felt In A Nightshade
I'm Glad To Be Here
Escape Into Inner
Until Frigid Zones
Now Nothing Can Stop Me

Capturin' The Daylight
Please Let Me Disappear
If Felt In A Nightshade
I'm Glad To Be Here
Escape Into Inner
Until Frigid Zones
Now Nothing Can Stop Me

Out Of Time
Interzone

Escape Into Inner
Until Frigid Zones
Now Nothing Can Stop Me

Overspaces
Still Alone

Escape Into Inner
Until Frigid Zones
Now Nothing Can Stop Me
