Remain - Suffer - Resist
Alive!
Remain - Suffer - Resist

Lights Off At Night,
Many Years Of Mental Trip
But Still Alive
So Lost Behind,
I Refuse The Bright Of Lights
I'm So High

Remain - Suffer - Resist
Alive!
Remain - Suffer - Resist

Nothin' Is So Painful
Than Justify Our Own Living
And Still Looking Around
Trembling With Hate
Without Guarantee
