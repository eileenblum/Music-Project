This Is Your Slice Of Life
Nobody Is By Your Side
Too Many Things You've Left Behind
You're Still Going On Your Way
Runnin' Alone
Inside Your Pride

What Have I Done
Why Should I Blame
Why Should I Care
Gone It's Gone
Everyday It's The Same
It's A Sharper Shape

Wonder Why I Have To Choose
These Structures Are Condemned, Are Fools
We'll Search The Answers Inside Ouselves
We'll Live Our Life Over The End

No Freedom Of Choice
It's Imprisoning You
Bleed In Anger
Downed By Laws
Dictators Witness
Theocratic Stubborn

Wonder Why I Have To Choose
I'll Show To You The Wonder World
The Divine Justice As You Know
Can't Help You To Restore

Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?

Where Is Your God?
Where Is Your God?
Where Is Your God?
Where Is Your God?

Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?
Who Is Your God?
