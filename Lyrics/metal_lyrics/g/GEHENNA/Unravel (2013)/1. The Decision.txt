From the womb
Along a bloody trail
To the slab

Wish that from then to now
Circumstance could change

The noose tightens
Decide to cut deeper
Turn away
Change is better

Breathe
Fill your lungs
And stagger on
Into a thick black ocean

After squirming for so long
You are finally gone
