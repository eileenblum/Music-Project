[Music and lyrics by Sanrabb]

A THOUSAND KILLINGS
A THOUSAND FIRST TIMES TO DIE
DEATH IS CLOSING IN FROM ALL SIDES
WE DON'T CARE WHO LIVES OR DIES
THE TRUTH BE KNOWN IN A WORLD OF LIES

INNOCENCE DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE
WITH ONE THING ON OUR MIND
WE TRULY ARE THE KILLING KIND
SCREAM OUT FOR BLOOD!
MANKIND HAS RID ITSELF OF ITS COWARD CONSCIENCE
AND NOW WE SCREAM OUR FOR BLOOD
BLOOD WE SPILL. WE LOVE TO KILL

INNOCENCE DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE
WITH ONE THING ON OUR MIND
WE TRULY ARE THE KILLING KIND
SCREAM OUR FOR WAR

WAR!
