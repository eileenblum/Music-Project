[Music by Sanrabb, Lyrics by Dolgar]

CHAOS IS STRIVING FORTH
UNEXPECTED
THE ULTIMATE WEAPONRY
UNLEASHED UPON MANKIND
GAINING POWER FROM THE VICTIMS
AWARENESS OF DEATH
REALISE YOUR DEATH WILL NOT BE THE FINAL HORROR

THE WORLD IS BURNING
MANKIND WILL BE NO MORE

STILL AMAZED
THIS TECHNOLOGICAL TERROR
WAS MADE BY HUMAN HANDS

GENOCIDE

ENTIRE NATIONS ARE WAITING TO DIE
TRULY INNOVATIVE
HOW MANY WAYS DEATH WILL FIND

WHO PROVOKED THE GODS TO RETURN
THEY CAUSED SUCH ANGER
THAT ALL LIFE MUST BURN

TURN THIS PLANET
INTO A PLACE
WHERE THE ALIEN SPECIES
WILL BE LIFE ITSELF
