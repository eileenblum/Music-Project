[Music and lyrics by Sanrabb]

TENSIONS RISING
ANCIENT BLOODFEUD RENEWED
OVERCOME BY ANGER
THE DAYS OF THE EARTH ARE NUMBERED

REBEL
ADMIRION BLACK
THE GLORY DAYS ARE OVER
ADMIRION BLACK

THE FINAL DAY HAS COME
ALL PREPARATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE
RELEASE THE FINAL FLOW
STAND BY AND SEE THE FLOOD FLOW
ARMAGEDDON YEAR 2000

HUMANITY GOES TO WAR
IN ETERNAL DEFIANCE
GODS REIGN EXISTS NO MORE

REBEL
ADMIRION BLACK
THE GLORY DAYS ARE OVER
AS SATAN ATTACKS
