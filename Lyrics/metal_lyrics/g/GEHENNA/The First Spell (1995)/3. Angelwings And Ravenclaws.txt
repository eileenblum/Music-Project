Crossing the channel of fire
The wings of the dragon shall carry me high
The sky so dark and cold
Known only to the spirits that grew old

We rush towards th ravenclaws
They silently await to crush us all
We await the coming
Cursed as hellbound lizards we all shall crawl

Not the blessed
Nor the gifted
We choose the true evil
Not the feeble

We lords of dogs
We lords of the hammer
We lords of swords
We call upon thee
Souls of the infernal
Ghosts of the wicked
Spirits of all that is evil
Dance to the masters organ

We call upon you
Incarnated souls of disaster
Spread the fire all high and loww
The ravenclaws have waited to long
