Soon his eyes stare up on you
The sun Lucifer
The seal of Sin
Upon your chest, protect you

In the sky the morning star soars
Way up high remind us all
The years to come all love will die

Before the sun, a star sends its light
Set your ritual.........right
Streams of torment
Streams of blood
Fear for your doul, your spirit

Remember me gaze at the sun
Light your fire let them remember
Forgetful they are
Still they are gods

In the sky
Way up high where I roam
All love will die

Let the ghosts gather
Wandering endlessly
All of them old and new
Let them all gather

All hell your ritual seam to attract
