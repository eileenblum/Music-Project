Pure Darkness
Prevail
By the eight we condemn you to hell
Where is God as you cling to your faith?
Your last hope is in a grenade

At the end of
Nowhere
Sweaty palms and
Coward stare
Here
This is
What you fear

Sacrificial
Anatomy of God
Disaster breed
Without worth

No greater meaning
No higher truth
No blissful being
Just darkness
And you
