Cut out the tongue of the christian deciever
Let the pain purge him like in ancient times
Leave him to lament
Leave him to suffer
His tortured soul is going to burn

Destined to never see
To be a slave
in heavenly misery

Wakes up eyes shut
He worships a god unknown

No salvation for this dying believer
Only pain

Worships the corpse
A fading memory
Dead is the legacy of the crucified one

Cut out the tongue of the christian deciever
Let the pain purge him like in ancient times
Judgement is drawing ever closer
A world of pain awaits the slave
