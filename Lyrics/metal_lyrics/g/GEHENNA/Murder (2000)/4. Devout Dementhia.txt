How big was your sacrifice?
Have you sold something
You couldn't do without?
Ignorant of what would follow
Your stupidity
You now find yourself on your knees
Struggling to achieve
So eager to please
You stuggle to become
Nothing

Doing what you do
Not knowing why
Not knowing that you are a mutation
Of the original lie
Continuing the plague cultivating the sickness

Slowly
Killing you day by day
Abusing you
Starving you
Until you shrivel up
And blow away
And now you find yourself
In a coffin among the dead

You cannot leave where would you go? Your mind is twisted
Distorted
Continuing the plague cultivating the sickness
