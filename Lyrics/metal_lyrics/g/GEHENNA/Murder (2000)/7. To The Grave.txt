Where does he live?
He that controls your flesh
Does he breathe in your blood?
Does he feed while you sleep?

Polluting your thoughts
Your soul is bleeding still
As you drain you feel
The urge to kill

In a world where madness
Is majority
Are you sure it's not you
Who is the parasite?

As you fight
Your mind's confusion
Life presents it's best
Solution
