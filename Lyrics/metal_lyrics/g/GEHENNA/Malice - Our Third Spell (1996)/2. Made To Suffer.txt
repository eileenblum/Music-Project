[Music by Sanrabb and Sarcana]
[Lyrics by Sanrabb]

Midnight,cling to your soul
You are writing in pain
Fire calling you back to suffer again
Anger results in failure
You believe in a dying god
Burning,you cannot look the other way
You believe in a dying god

Will tomorrow bring you pain ?
Will tomorrow be a new day ?
Rise and shine or fade
Are you alive or are you dead ?

Time will tell

Mankind seeks an evil god...Believe
Satan lives eternally

When morning comes can you feel your beating heart?

Show yourself
In light of night?
This is the way to hell

Time will tell
Time will tell

Mankind seeks an evil god !
