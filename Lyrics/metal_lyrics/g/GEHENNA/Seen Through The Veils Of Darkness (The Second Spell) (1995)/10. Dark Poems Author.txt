[Music by Sanrabb, Sarcana and Dolgar, Lyrics by Sanrabb]

SEVERED WAS HIS HEAD BUT STILL HE COULD SEE FAR, FAR AWAY
THEIR OPEN PLAINS, THEIR OPEN FIELDS

WHERE RIVERS RAN WITH BLOOD THEY LIFTED HIS BODY
DRENCHED IN SUMMERIAN BLACK WATERS OF SIN

CLIPPED ARE THE WINGS OF THIS ANGEL
HIS VOICE HAS BEEN SILENCED
STRIPPED HE HAS BEE LIMB FROM LIMB

THE PASSAGE LIES OPEN, THEY ARE ALL WRITTEN DOWN WORD BY WORD
THEIR AUTHOR, LORD OF THE CRYPTIC SEAS

CELESTRIAL GUARDIAN OF THEIR TALE AND SCRIPTURES
LEAD THEM TO THE FIRE BURNING
AND THEY SHALL GROW

WHEN ALL THIS HAD BEEN DONE HIS SIGHT WAS STILL UPON THEM
NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT HIS EYES WOULD SHUT
THROUGH HINNUMS EMBERS, A LIGHT SHALL BLIND HIM FOREVER

"THROUGHOUT ETERNAL SPACES DREAD SILENCE FELL.
HEAVEN TREMBLED AS COMPASSSIONED ENTERED HELL. TO
THIS EXTENT I GRANT THEE MY SECOND SPELL."
