[Music by Sanrabb and Sarcana, Lyrics by Svartalv and Dolgar]

IN A CROOKED HOUSE AS OLD AS THE FOREST
A CHILD WAS BORN IN FIRE

HER HELLISH VOICE, HER FURIOUS SCREAMS
IN MY CRYSTAL THAT NIGHT I COULD HEAR

TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN: THE DAY SHE WAS BORN
SUFFERED AND DIED IN THEIR CRYPTS

A WITCH IS BORN [REPEAT x4]

WITH EYES OF LIGHTNING, RAVEN BLACK HAIR
SHE WAS A BEAUTY

SHE CAME HERE TO RULE AS ALL
WITH HER CRUELTY

I ADMIRE HER BEAUTY, AND
THE MADNESS THAT SHE BRINGS
SINGING IN AWE
HAIL O NEW BORN WITCH

A WITCH IS BORN [REPEAT x4]
