[Music by Sanrabb and Sarcana, Lyrics by Dirge Rep]

ALL THIS IS SEEN IN BLACK AND WHITE
THIS STORM, THIS SEA

A VIOLENT INFERNO, OUT OF NOWHERE

"DEVIL, PAINTING MY SOUL BLACK
YOUR BLOOD FLOWS IN MY VEINS
MASTER OF RATS, LEADER OF BATS
YOU ARE THE SUN, YOU ARE THE MOON
YOU ARE THE WIND THAT SWEEPS THIS LAND"

I WILL CROSS WITH GLORY AND PRIDE

"THE SUNSET THAT NEVER ENDS
THE WAVE THAT NEVER STOPS
THE TREE THAT NEVER GREW OLD
DARKNESS AND PAIN FOREVER REIGN
YOU ARE MY BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE SKY, O SHAITAN"

I GAVE MY SOUL AND I WILL BURN
A RIVER OF MADNESS, A PATH OF SIN
THE PIT OF HORRORS THAT YOU SHOWED ME
IS WHERE I WILL DWELL AND STAY IN COMMAND
