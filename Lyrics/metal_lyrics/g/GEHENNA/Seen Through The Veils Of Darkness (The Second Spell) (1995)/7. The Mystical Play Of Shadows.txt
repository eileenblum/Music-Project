[Music by Sanrabb, Lyrics by Sanrabb]

EVERY NIGHT A DARKER ONE
A TIME OF DEATH AND SLAUGHTER
A CHANGE OF LIGHT, A DARKER NIGHT
I SAW THE LAST DAWN
ELDER FORCES AROUND ME
OF THE MORTALS LEFT BEHIND
LEAD ME AGAIN TO THIS SHRINE

THE WOLVES IN THEIR MIDNIGHT SPEECHES
SCREAM MY NAME OUT LOUD IN TORMENT
AS THEY HAUNT YOU, HAUNT YOU ALL
FOREVER (SO EVIL, SO DARK)

THE DEAD SCREAM AND WRITHE
IN PAINS THEY FEEL POST-MORTEM
THE THRONE OF THOUGHTS STANDS
THIS IS THE END OF BOTH FIEND AND FRIEND
