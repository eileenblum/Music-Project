[Music by Sarcana and Sanrabb, Lyrics by Sanrabb]

MY EYES CLOSE AND I SINK
FROM THIS EXISTENCE TO A POINT OF BLISS
THE SILENT SHADOWS SEEMS TO COME MY WAY
NOW I SEE
PIERCED ARE THE EYES OF THE RUN
THROUGH I SEE A BLACK DAWN RISING
FOR CENTURIES IT HAS GIVEN YOU HOPE
BUT IT IS SLOWLY FALLING
NOW DRAINING YOU
DRAINING YOU OF LIVE
GRANTING YOU DEATH, THE DARKEST
LIFE GAVE YOU SOLACE BUT NOT ANY MORE
LIFE ONLY SHOWS YOU THE HORROR
HORROR... GOD'S OWN
