[Music by Sanrabb and Dolgar, Lyrics by Dolgar]

MONOTONOUS LANDSCAPE
STRETCHES ENDLESSLY
AND CONCEALS MANY LOST LIVES
AN AGE OF EVIL MEMORIES
WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN, WILL
NOT BE FORGOTTEN

IS THERE SORROW IN THE AIR?
IS ANXIETY SOWN IN FROZEN
GROUND?

...TEARS OF ANGUISH...

TODAY ONLY RUINS ARE LEFT
AS THE EARTH'S OWN SCARS THEY
STAND, SILENT
STONE BY STONE, COVERED WITH
SNOW
DO YOU KNOW HOW IT HURTS
