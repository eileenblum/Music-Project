[Music by Sanrabb and Dolgar, Lyrics by Sanrabb and Dirge Rep]

ABOVE THE EARTH SWARM THOUSANDS
ON THE GROUND THEY RUN BY THE SIGN OF THE SUN
IN THE WASTES SUMMONS A VOICE
A VOICE OF DESTRUCTION, THE CALLS FOR STARVATION
ABOMINATION TOWARDS TEH SUN
NOW THERE IS NOWHERE TO RUN

FOUL AND CURSED
A HOME OF UGLINESS, TORTURE AND PAIN

TAKE ME THERE

THE HORROR THAT HIDES BEHIND THIS SUPERNATURAL BEING
FOUL AND CURSED

THE STENCH OF THIS DESERT
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

HE IS LORD OF FLIES
