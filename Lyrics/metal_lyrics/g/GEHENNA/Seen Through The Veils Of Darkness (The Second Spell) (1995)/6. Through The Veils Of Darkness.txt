[Music by Sanrabb and Sarcana, Lyrics by Sanrabb]

I LEAVE THIS WORLD BEHIND
IN ABENCE OF MY BODY
WHERE TAILS OF TROUBLED SOULS
SHALL LEAD THE WAY

I SWORE TO RETURN TO THIS PLACE OF SUFFERING

AND WHEN I SEE THE DEMON'S EYE STARE AT ME
I KNOW MY TIME HAS COME
AND ALL I COULD DO HAS BEEN DONE
BROUGHT TO THE END OF MY TRAIL
I STOP AND BEHOLD ALL THE DIFFERENT WORLDS
I AM SHAPELESS, DEAD AND LOST FOR WORDS...
