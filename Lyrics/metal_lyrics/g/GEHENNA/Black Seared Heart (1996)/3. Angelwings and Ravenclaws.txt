[Music and lyrics by Sanrabb]

Crossing the channel of fire
The wings of the dragon shall carry my high
The sky so dark and cold
Known only to the spirits that grew old
We rush towards the ravenclaws
That silently await to crush us all
We await the coming
Cursed as hellhouse lizards we all shall crawl

Not the blessed
Nor the gifted
We choose the true evil
Not the feeble

We lords of dogs
We lords of the hamlets
We lords of swords
We call upon thee
Souls of the infernal
Ghosts of the wicked
Spirits of all that is still
Dance to the masters organ

We call upon you
Incarnated souls of disaster
Spread the fire all high and low
The ravenclaws has waited too long
