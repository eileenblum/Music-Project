[Music by Sanrabb, Lyrics by Svartalv]

In a crooked house
As old as the forest
A child was born in fire

Her hellish voice
Her screams and yells
In my crystal that night I could hear

Ten thousand children
That day she was born
Suffered and died in their cribs

A witch is born

With eyes of lightning
Raven black hair
She was a beauty

She came here with evil and the cruelest plague

I admire her beauty
And the madness that she brings
Singing in awe
Hair o' new born witch

A witch is born
