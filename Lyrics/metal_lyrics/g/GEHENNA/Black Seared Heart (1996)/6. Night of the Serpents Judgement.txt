[Music and lyrics by Sanrabb]

Many nights I have waked
Waiting for the four winds to gather
Here in the desert there are no roads
They went away the night before

Silence only surrounds me
For things left behind
Be it a gate to this shrine

The wolves in their midnight speeches
Scream my name out loud in torment
I shall haunt you, haunt you all
Desecrate your neverdying souls
Only darkness can hold this lonesome soul

In darkness I drown the pains away
I shall haunt you, haunt you all
Dececrate your neverdying souls
...your souls...
