Solitude on the glass
Ancient land in the drops
Seven birds from mountains
From the heights flying down
From the heights flying down
Seven birds from mountains
Fleeing 'till reach the seeds
In the seeds fall asleep
In the seeds covered by
Fragrance of green grassveil
Plantheart is hammering
Seven birds slumbering
Perisperm, embryo
Shivering in their husk
Tightening from the moist
Fissuring, prostrating
Spread the wings, embrace light
Feather's fire, dance is sign
Flying from green streamlet
Seven birds ascending
