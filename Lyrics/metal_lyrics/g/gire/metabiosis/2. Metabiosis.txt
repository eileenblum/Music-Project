Springtime wedding, secret one
Unsealing a treasure scarce
Wanderer in deep shadows
Of a moment shining-eyed
Summer maelstrom, opulent
Nurturing a fire sweet
In the weave of dense kerchiefs
Grassbearded wayfarer
Autumnal foil, sallowing
Into throbbing, sad music
Awakening in mirebed
Made by seedy mournings
In the gloom of Winter songs
Ever seen the drowning one
In a silent, dreamy, wet
Wondrous love who's dying?
