Out of her hair of fire
Four dark horses shall gallop
On their wings all angels screaming
'Neath the earth fallen down!
Out of a halcyon sun
Four dark horses shall gallop
On their hooves all muddy faces
Howling into you!
Out of the olden divan
Four dark horses shall gallop
Her cooling voice flutters softly
Goldensunrise breaking!
