Sunlight has whirld into gullies
Into the moss and stones away
Waters are carrying for you
A sign of slumber in yellow
Mother Bear, night is impending
Dreams are but ancient miasmas
Frostpast is breaking out of my bones
Cover my world so tiny
Thy fur mine asylum
Silented isolation
Mushroomstrand in my heart
Limesnailshell forsaken
But still have to walk and pass on
Sink into murky leafworld
Coalcoloured law that breaks me
Into a fish-shaped secret
