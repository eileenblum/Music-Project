Linger in cleft
I wait for traveller
Strike them with iron club
Strike them and bring them death

Murder and robbery
Strip them of all I fancy
Leave them hidden
For wild beasts to eat
Rich or poor
Weak or strong
Scare you to death
AMBUSH

Drift into the spider house
And hear me not until I am upon you
These paths are foreign to you
Fight or flight
I will bash you

A coward I am
But this knowledge makes me angry and frenzied
In the instant I pound you
I will feel nothing
The guilt will come when I rest
And consume me until I am a deadly wreck
