And so it was that shivering and filthy among the pits, pelted by rain and blinded by wind, we travelled to ??? with the dead.
The sage led us here to study the rot. Streams flow past and in their snaked inflictions the expressions are more austere.
To drink of the sadness and hush down below. The silence ??? us and gave the gift of sight.
Of other places separated by death and ??? with blood.
The torches were lit, our faces revealed: mirrors to begin breathing the smoke of elders.
We lie with the ancestors and witness the grief, the world.
Marked by their dust, the moon signals that the ritual is done.
When the thorns have pierced our tongues and the blood has been spat upon love and the colour is red, the abyss of death is coated anew.
