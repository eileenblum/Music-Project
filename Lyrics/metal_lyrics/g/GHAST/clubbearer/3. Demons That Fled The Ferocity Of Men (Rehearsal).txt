We had left a life of merciless death for something we had glimpsed in dreams.
A place we could sleep unarmed and fear could be left to the past. We drank away our memories, fucked and kissed goodbye our scorn.
In secrecy and ritual we smashed our swords and buried our names. But those whom weâd left behind needed only to see a face.
So they brought their steel upon us. So we let death into our hearts and slew our foes where they stood and left their corpses at that place.
Towards more vultures, hate sheathed to the waist and death in our hearts where it has always belonged.
Amidst blood forever; I knew the sword was hatred and most fierce vengeance is all.
