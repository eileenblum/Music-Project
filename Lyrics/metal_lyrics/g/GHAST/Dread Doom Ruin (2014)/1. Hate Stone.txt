The stone is cold and wet.
The magic-men remove the gloves and
place their right hands on its surface,
their eyes closed as they chant the incantation in unison.
And then they each splash blood from their palms
onto the sacred pillar and the spell is cast
They have sealed their hate into the stone
and all of them drop to the ground about it, lifeless.
Every living thing that approaches the stone
will feel conflict and be driven to violence.
Plant will suffocate plant, beast will attack beast,
insect will devour insect
and man will kill man
near this sacred stone
