We had left a life of merciless death for something we had glimpsed in dreams.
A place we could sleep unarmed and fear could be left to the past.
We drank away our memories. Fucked and kissed goodbye our scorn.
In secrecy and ritual we smashed our swords and buried our names.
But those whom we'd left behind needed only to see a face.
So they brought this steel upon us. So we let death into our hearts and slew our foes where they stood
and left all their corpses in that place _____s more _____ftures, hate sheathed to the waist and death
in our hearts where it has always belonged.
Amidst blood forever. I knew the sword was hatred and most fierce vengeance is all.
