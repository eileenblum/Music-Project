I have been drifting as a spirit,
But I am still gripping to mankind.
Always drawn to the same place
Beneath the stars and the moon.

Many times, I fell.
May this once my skull
Meet with the rocks and break.

Let me rise and leave this corpse
A shell among the pine.
And whoever finds me,
Follow my gaze.
Gather us all, like the sea.Â
