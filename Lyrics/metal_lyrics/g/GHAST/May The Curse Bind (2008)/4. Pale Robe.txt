As I wander this night I feel wild
And this mist is as colourless as my face.
The Vapours have damaged my throat and lungs
As I breathe.
I have lost myself in thy grasp, O mist.

Bear me down,
Cloak of the sea,
Robe af the moors.

I have lost myself
I have lost the will.
Bear me down
Cloak of the sea,
Robe of the moors.
