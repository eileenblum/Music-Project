Bellis Intergalactus

Ancient cosmic wormhole
Chaos lord arise

I have arrived from the future
Into a terrible past
Chaos and war on the plains of Dunkeld
The armies of darkness amassed
Is this a twisted dimension?
Is this true reality?
A symbol of evil is flying once more
Above the proud spires of Dundee

A burning black sun
The siege of Dunkeld has begun
Defeat of the ancient town is nigh
In hoots we trust

Horrifying fecal demons
Rising up out of the caverns below
Dark robotic astral zombies
Eating the peasants who live in Glasgow
Siege engines of hell's creation
Blasting the walls with unholy fire
Undead forces marching onward
Army of evil so tragic and dire

Look up to the sky
A glorious battlecry
The forces of justice call his name

In hoots we trust
We trust
By the power of the Holy King of Unst
Hail hoots
For the glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle, in his power we must trust to set us free
Confutatis Maledictis Caledoniae
In hoots we trust

I am the Bane of Cowdenbeath
The Scourge of Auchtermuchty
Arch-Foe of the Questlords of Inverness
Come face me in battle, Angus
And prepare to meet thy doom!

Your dark dominion has corrupted Dundee
With a swing of my hammer I'll end this misery

Legendary battle
Epic war is fight

What mystic enchantment has Zargothrax spun?
My weapon has no effect, this fight can't be won

Pathetic mortal scum!
In this dimension, your hammer has no power over me
Now, kneel before your Emperor
Kneel before... Your God!

In hoots we trust
We trust
By the power of the Holy King of Unst
Hail hoots
For the Glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle, in his power we must trust to set us free
In hoots we trust
By the power of the Holy King of Unst
For the Glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle, in his power we must trust to set us free
In hoots we trust

In hoots we trust
We trust
By the power of the Holy King of Unst
Hail hoots
For the Glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle, in his power we must trust to set us free
In hoots we trust
By the power of the Holy King of Unst
For the Glory of Dundee
To win this epic battle, in his power we must trust to set us free
In hoots we trust
