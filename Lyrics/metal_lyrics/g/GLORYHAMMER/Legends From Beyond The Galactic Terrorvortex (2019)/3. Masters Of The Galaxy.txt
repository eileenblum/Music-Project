Far to the East, an army of evil is rising
Deathknights of Crail
Under the spell of sorcerer's twisted design
To darkness we hail
With their blades of black fire they enslave the land
Obeying their master's will
The force of their terror no mortal can stand
Knights of evil, kill

Long ago in the distant future, they were a force for the light
But now in the ancient times, they slaughter peasants by night

We are the Masters of the Galaxy
We're the Lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
On a quest for all eternity
We're the Masters of the Galaxy
We're the Lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
Knights of Evil, arise

Leading the charge is the mightiest scion of evil
Mighty indeed
Proletius his name, grandmaster of death and decay
Worship or bleed
In another dimension he fought for the king
And the glory of all Dundee
Now corrupted by darkness he kills everything
Mwah ha ha ha

Stabbed through the heart with the Knife of Evil, it infected his brain
Anti-Telharsic power now flowing through his veins

We are the Masters of the Galaxy
We're the Lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
On a quest that's never ending
We're the Masters of the Galaxy
We're the Lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
Knights of Evil, arise

Grand Master Proletius! Dispatch your Knights of Evil to slaughter more peasants in Auchtermuchty!
As you command, Lord Zargothrax. Deathknights of Crail... to battle!

We are the Masters of the Galaxy
We're the Lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
On a quest for all eternity
We're the Masters of the Galaxy
We're the Lords of Space Dundee
The destroyers of reality
Knights of Evil, arise
