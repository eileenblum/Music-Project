Quest for Fife to end pain and strife
In search of the enchanted engine!
Far and wide, I roam through Speyside
Into the deepest dark dungeon

There it waits, behind golden gates
Sealed in a chest made of diamonds
Heart pure as steel I must reveal
To hold artifact in my hands

A gleam of steam surrounds the machine of might

And in my dreams I am flying (whoa oh)
Over Cowdenbeath
Across an endless horizon (whoa oh)
Fly forever free
Below me I can see the world so far away
And in my dreams I am flying (whoa oh)
Flying through the Kingdom of Dundee
On a jet pack made of cosmic steel

Run for your life! The cave now is rife
With laser trolls' sudden appearing
Wizard must know where I was to go
Though he sent his hordes I'm not fearing

Battle is fight with beams of black light
Clashing with my mighty hammer
The evil troll shoots, lacking power of hoots
Never they will prevail

There is a goblin in the castle...take heed!

And in my dreams I am flying (whoa oh)
Over Cowdenbeath
Across an endless horizon (whoa oh)
Fly forever free
Below me I can see the world so far away
And in my dreams I am flying (whoa oh)
Flying through the Kingdom of Dundee
On a jet pack made of cosmic steel

Now it's time to
Fly away, star-born defender
To realms beyond space I soar
Clouds beneath and stars lie before me
No return forevermore, so
Hail to you, all that I've known here
With speed of light I'm to rise
Heavenwards, wielding the hammer
Riding on the astral fire far beyond the sky

And in my dreams I am flying (whoa oh)
Over Cowdenbeath
Across an endless horizon (whoa oh)
Fly forever free
Below me I can see the world so far away
And in my dreams I am flying (whoa oh)
Flying through the Kingdom of Dundee
On a jet pack made of cosmic steel
