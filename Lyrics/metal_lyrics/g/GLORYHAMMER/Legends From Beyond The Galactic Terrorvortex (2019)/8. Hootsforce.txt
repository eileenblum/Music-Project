Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring
Fight for the ancient story
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory

All across the land of Fife, grim chaos reigns supreme
Shackled by the mind control of the dark lord of Dundee
Yet still there lies the chance of hope now Angus has returned
The sigil of the Hootsforce in the sky tonight will burn

Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring
Fight for the ancient story
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory
Fight 'til we die, in a battle in the sky
Fight all the foes before thee
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory
Hootsforce arise

Hootsforce!
We are the Hootsforce!
Hootsforce!
We are the Hootsforce!

Forces of resistance, it is time to make a stand
No longer will Lord Zargothrax enslave our ancient land
Sub Commander Ralathor, engage your nuclear force
The battlefield of Cowdenbeath is where we'll set our course	

In a submarine
Beneath the seas
Of Achnasheen
We remain unseen
But now the time
Has come to rise
Ascend into the skies
Hootsforce

Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring
Fight for the ancient story
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory
Fight 'til we die, in a battle in the sky
Fight all the foes before thee
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory

Fight 'til we die, in a battle in the sky
Fight all the foes before thee
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory

Fight for the king, for the hammer and the ring
Fight for the ancient story
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory
Fight 'til we die, in a battle in the sky
Fight all the foes before thee
Fight for your life, we must fight for Fife
For the power and the glory
Hootsforce arise

Hootsforce!
We are the Hootsforce!
Hootsforce!
We are the Hootsforce!
