Have you ever seen the galaxy ablaze
Have you ever fought a wizard face to face
Have you ever watched the Kingdom turn to dust
As a unicorn devours with its lust

I have seen many worlds
And travelled through time
But nothing prepares
For ultimate fight

I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise, from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win
The Battle for Eternity

Have you ever killed a goblin on the moon
Have you ever rode an eagle to its doom
Have you ever seen the spires of proud Dundee
Burning with the fire of destiny

The Kingdom of Fife
Will never to die
Raise up your hammer
And scream to the sky

I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise, from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win
The Battle for Eternity

I am the final defender

I am the final defender
The last hope for this galaxy
Dundee will arise, from evil demise
I'm the one with the power to win
The Battle for Eternity
