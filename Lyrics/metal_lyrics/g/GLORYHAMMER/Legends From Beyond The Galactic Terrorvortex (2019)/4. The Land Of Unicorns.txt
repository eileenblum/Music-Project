I have arrived, in a world ruled by chaos and evil
Darkness enfolds the land that I once called my home
Lost in the realm of an ancient and powerful wizard
Now I must quest to take back the Crystalline Throne

Legends speak of a glen
Where truth and justice still reign

Ride far away cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns

Follow the path, laid down by the forces of justice
Over the stones, and into the mountains of fire
Fighting with trolls, and undead defenders of chaos
Onwards I ride, in search of the land I desire

Descend out of the mists
The valley of Achnasheen

Ride far away cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns

The mists are clearing now
I see the realm before my eyes
Ralathor the warrior greets me to the mystic land
The Land of Unicorns

Ride far away cross the mighty River Tay
Over mountains into the unknown
Follow your heart, let it guide you through the dark
To the Land of Unicorns
