Remember the days long ago, when we fought side by side for the glory
Battling foes of Dundee in a war in the sky
Now in this valley we hide, the last hope in this desperate story
Onwards into the unknown you must quest forever

In an alternate dimension
Under spell of evil warlock
There's no chance to return to our home

Now we're far away, lost in a different reality
Slaying dragons
Fighting to save the Kingdom of Fife
We are warriors
Wielding the hammer so glorious
Fighting with the power of the laser dragon fire

I have discovered a scroll, telling tales of equipment for wizard
A jet pack of ultimate steel with the power to fly
It lies in a cave to the north guarded by unholy creatures
But if your quest is to fail we'll all die together

With the boost of mighty jet pack
Into outer space you can arise
And find your destiny once more

Now we're far away, lost in a different reality
Slaying dragons
Fighting to save the Kingdom of Fife
We are warriors
Wielding the hammer so glorious
Fighting with the power of the laser dragon fire

Ride forth, mighty warrior, beyond the crystalline gates of the Land of Unicorns, into the great plague lands of Caithness... there you must seek your true destiny. Many perils await you on your journey, but victorious you will return with the power to defeat Zargothrax for all eternity!

Remember the heroes
Who died in the war of Space Dundee
Now lost in another galaxy

Far away, lost in a different reality
One more final battle to save the Kingdom of Fife

Far away, lost in a different reality
Slaying dragons
Fighting to save the Kingdom of Fife
We are warriors
Wielding the hammer so glorious
Fighting with the power of the
Ancient holy tragic raging laser dragon fire
