The Questlords of Inverness ride
Far far away, to the ultimate light
Travelling throughout the time
The Questlords of Inverness ride
To Galactic Fortress!

They storm the universe in interstellar time
From the town of Inverness beneath the ancient sign
Warriors of power steel who hear galactic cry
Unicorn defenders, unafraid to die

Zargothrax is riding on, with crystal key in hand
Nobody can stop him, bring death across the land
Questlords of Inverness, the time has come to fight
Ride to space battle with brave highland's might

Questlords arise, fight til we die
For the honour, the glory, the pride
Ride on the wind and hail to the king
When the Questlords of Inverness ride

Mighty heroes quest to Mars to fight the demon horde
Undead force of terror, will fall beneath the sword
Raise the flag of Inverness, rally all the troops
Fight for Dundee and the power of Hoots

Unicorn! Show me the way
Lead me to the ultimate fortress
Unicorn! Reveal the truth
Of the ancient crystal galaxy
