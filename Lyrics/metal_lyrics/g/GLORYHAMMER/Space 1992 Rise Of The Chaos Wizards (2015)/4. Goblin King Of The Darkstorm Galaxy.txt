I have returned from centuries of slumber, now the universe must burn
I feel the power, yet still I thirst for more, ancient secrets I must learn
I ride the twilight, in search of cosmic fire
The Goblin King knows my desire

Regis! Kobalos! Cast unholy fire!

Goblin King of the Darkstorm Galaxy
Ride on the wings of doom
Grant me the power to fight my foes
And defeat the lords of the moon

This magic crystal is the artifact you seek to unleash evil from the sky
You must find the portal, the crystal is the key...all universal life will die!
Deep beneath Dundee, the mighty citadel
There lies a passageway to Hell
