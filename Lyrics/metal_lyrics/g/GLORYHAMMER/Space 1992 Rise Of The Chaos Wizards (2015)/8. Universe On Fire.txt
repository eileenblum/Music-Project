I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Carrying the breath on fire within the lungs of steel
Soaring to light the flame forged by cosmic ordeal
Ascending in mighty dragons with metal wings and claw
In a great battle foregone one thousand years ago

Now lead me to the stars
Atomic flame ignite my heart

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Gliding across the sun to soak up all its might
Charging my solar gun and prepare for epic fight
Questing through nebulas in search for crystal stone
That gives me the overdose of force to claim space throne

It is time, take up your arms
Nova bombs and plasma guns

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light

Set me on fire

I wanna set the universe on fire
Feel it burn tonight
Set the universe on fire
There's no end in sight

Bring me to the holy raging power
Where I find my destiny
The universe on fire
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
