There was a time when legends of Crail ran true
All over, their majesty everyone knew
But now in the future, defeated by evil untold
We yearn for the knight from story of old

A hero cannot be defeated
Simply by making him die
Proletius will rise
A hologram hero will fight

Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious, riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle force

Inside the chamber of cryogenetical fire
A magical wizard is doing a spell
Powered by robots, a hologram coming to life
To stand at the side of the king of Fife

The galaxy knights are rising
Reborn from the ashes of Crail
A force for the light
To whom we eternally hail

Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious, riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle force

[Spoken:]
Mighty warriors of the galaxy
You have proven yourselves to be mighty indeed
Now, who of you will join me in my Space Knights of Crail?

Victorious eagle warfare
So glorious, riding high up in the sky
Victorious eagle warfare
Brave warriors questing hard until they die
With nothing above but the heavens above
Fight against power of evil corrupt
Guiding us on through the war
Eagle force
