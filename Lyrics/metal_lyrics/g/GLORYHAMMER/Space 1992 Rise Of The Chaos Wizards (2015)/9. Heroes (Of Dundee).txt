As word spread of the demon army invasion that was threatening Mars, mighty warriors of the entire galaxy began to assemble in preparation to fight for the power of the cosmic justice. Crystalline darkness was falling upon the hearts of the assembled host. After a thousand years of peace, the Intergalactic Space Empire of Fife was about to once again plunge into a bloody war, standing behind the banner of Angus McFife XIII. Riding his ancestral laserdragon, the brave prince of Dundee stood before his proud legions and raised the Hammer of Glory to the heavens.

Fly! On gigantic dragons made out of steel.
Strike! With the Hammer of Glory, we will prevail
Kill! Our cosmical enemies with full force, blasting forth without remorse

Rage! With bold supersonic velocity
Trust! In our lasers to storm 'cross the galaxy
Die! For the universe that we are fighting for, to win the war, forevermore

For Dunkeld and Cowdenbeath, an epic war is fight

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee,
We are riding forth to free our galaxy
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee,
We are heroes, legends we will be!

Fear! Our troll mass destruction artillery.
Hear! Our battlecry echoing through the sphere
Ride! On the back of the dragons, we're standing proud, wrath unbound, we hold our ground

For Crail and for Aberdeen, an epic war is fight

We passed primordial black holes
Fought goblins and trolls on faraway stars
Together we dashed through infinity for honour and glory
From Neptune to Mars to Mercury
To bring it all to an end, to make our final stand
In unity we rise, we will ascend to realms we must protect
Mighty hammer connects
The force to annihilate Zargothrax

Yes, mighty warriors! In the name of cosmic justice we ride.
Glory will prevail this day...hail to the King of Dundee!

We are heroes, heroes of Dundee,
Now the time has come that we'll make history
We are heroes, heroes of Dundee,
We are heroes, legends we will be!
