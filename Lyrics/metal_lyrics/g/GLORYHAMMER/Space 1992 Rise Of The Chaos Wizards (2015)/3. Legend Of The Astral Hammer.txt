Slashing my way through an army of goblins on the dark side of the moon
Far overhead lunar dragons are swarming, my hammer will be their doom
Angus McFife the 13th my name, the scion of mighty Dundee
Intergalactic great hero of steel, ruler of the whole galaxy
Wielding this ancestral weapon, the Hammer of Glory its name
The kingdom of Fife will forever proclaim

Legend of the Astral Hammer
Forged in the heart of the celestial fire
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Minuscule goblin, impractical sword
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Powered by lasers entwined in a star
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Crystal enchantment of steel

Aeons ago the starlords descended Powerful unknown to man
With three epic weapons to safeguard from doom, concealing them far 'cross the land
Relics of legend, relics of might, forged in a time before time
For thousands of years unfathomed unknown, deep in a mystical shrine

Descendant of ultimate fighter
Now battle a war in the stars
Defending the kingdom from Demons of Mars

Now Zargothrax rises once more
To threaten the force of the light
Assemble the heroes of steel
Prepare for the ultimate fight
