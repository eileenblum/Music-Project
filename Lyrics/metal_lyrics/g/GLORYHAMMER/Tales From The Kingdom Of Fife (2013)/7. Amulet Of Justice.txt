Now I am mounting dragon, girdled by a golden gleam
to dearch for the last artefact I saw in my dream
a thousand legends twine around the mystery
how to find the periapt that setsthe spellbound free

Power of the universe
will guide me the way
my hammer I hold up high
so I proclaim

Amulet of Justice
your destiny awaits
in a land now reigned in shadow
by a wizard full of hate
i will ride across the highland
i will sail across the seas
the one and only hope for Fife
your mystic legacy

At the bottom of Loch Rannoch there is lying deep below
a necklace made of pure silk, with a gem as white as snow
i dive into the dark to avert calamity
brought by evil wizard over beloved Dundee

Power of the universe
will guide me the way
through worlds man has never seen
lone and arcane

Powers of the universe
have shown me the way
now I have the amulet
the kingdom I'll save

Quest complete!
