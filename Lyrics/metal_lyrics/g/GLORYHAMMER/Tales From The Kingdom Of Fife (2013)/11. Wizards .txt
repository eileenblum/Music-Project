[Bonus Track]High in the Cairngorm Mountains
An ancient war still burns
A magical missile shoots and fireball explodes
These are the spells of the wizards
Fighting the demon horde
A secret battle for eternity

Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Ancient and powerful keepers of chaos
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Casting their magic over the mountains
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Brewing a potion in the dark tower
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Guardians of time

Far from the past they travelled
In to the future they see
The crystal ball reveals all history
They see the coming battle
Across the galaxy
Where evil and good collide in a final war of steel

Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Ancient and powerful keepers of chaos
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Casting their magic over the mountains
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Brewing a potion in the dark tower
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Guardians of time

Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Ancient and powerful keepers of chaos
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Casting their magic over the mountains
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Brewing a potion in the dark tower
Wiiiiiizaaaards!
Guardians of time
