They came with the first light of dawn
setting their sights on Dundee
led by the sorcerer Zargothrax
slaying all people he sees
they ride to war on once noble beasts
corrupted by wizard spell
the unicorns used to be good
now they are forced to serve hell

Down from the mountains
and across the river Tay
an army of undead unicorns
are riding into the fray

Fireballs and lighting are raining from the sky
chaos and bloodshed while all the people die
in this epic battle begins the final war
tragedy will strike this day, prepare thee for
the unicorn invasion of Dundee

The townpeople had little hope
they were not ready for war
fireballs make everybody die
and buildings collapse to the floor
the beautiful princess was raped
and taken prison with cry
Angus McFife swears a mighty oath
"I will make Zargothrax die!"

The forces of darkness
are invading proud Dundee
there must find a hero
to save its destiny
