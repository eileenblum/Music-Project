Dundee! Mighty city on the
banks of the silv'ry Tay
your sacrifice will always be
remembered that fateful day
but now that the time has
come to regain our fallen pride
we march to war with an army
of eagles by our side
oh Dundee

Swiftly across the sapphire sky
the magic dragon flies
Angus McFife is atop his back
hear the battlecry!
down below, the knights of Crail
have rallied to the cause
the hammer of glory is their guide
a great majestic force

The final battle has begun
for freedom and Dundee

Oh brave chivistic rainbow
give me strength og angelic might!

Far from the north a hero comes
his armour made from wolf
he heard the call the defend his king
the barbarian warrior of Unst!
now at the side of lord McFife
across the land they ride
he know the way to the cidatel
where Zargothrax must hide

many evils guard the way
the castles has great might

In the epic rage of furious thunder
legends create their tales
when the twilight calls and the dark lord falls
our glory will prevail

The tower is high and mighty
we cannot climb the walls
we must find our way through the secret
tunnels of the dwarves

Through the ancient tunnels, the waariors make way
into a darkened cavern beneath the fortress great
led by a hermit, Relathor his name
the way to the castle his secret to betray

Mighty unicorn, that flies in the sky
touch the universe with your wings and hail the king

Now in the fields of Dunfermline
an epic war is fight
the knights of Crail make evil die
bring glory for the light
meanwhileinside the citadel
McFife has found the way
faceing to face with Zargothrax
and single combat waged

The evil wizard falls to doom
and drowns in liquid ice

In the epic rage of furious thunder
legends create their tales
when the twilight calls and the dark lord falls
our glory will prevail
