Riding my steel into faraway lands
searching for dragon to claim back the throne
into the forests of deepest Strathclyde
where time no centurieshas been foretold

A mighty warrior
questing to valleys unknown

A village of wizards revealed my the way
they saw it by searching a magical ball
enchanted chamber with mirror and fire
defeat it and dragon would be the reward
the be the chosen one
a hero must rise to the rest

Demon attacked me but then it was slain
the dragon appeared and a battle was fight
I spoke from the words of a powerful scroll
and magical dragon became now allied

Mighty and glorios
he flies through the emerald skies

Magic dragon
casting a spell on the mountains
covering wizards in glory
flying through majestic skies
searching for mighty powers
to defeat ultimate evil
ride on the wings of a dragon
flying through majestic skies
questing for the steel
