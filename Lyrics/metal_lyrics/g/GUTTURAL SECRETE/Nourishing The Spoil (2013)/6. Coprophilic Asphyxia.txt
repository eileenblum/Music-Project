[written by: Jensen/Thompson/Fitzgerald]

Obsessing over piss and shit,
Fecal orgy shit stained I sit
Gagging from the stench so vile
Suffocating with a smile
Puking on myself, regurgitating fecal matter
Feels like razorblades, carving up my throat
Self indulgent narcissism,
Giving myself deep incisions
Mixing shit with my blood...
Blood clots begin to form in my veins from the
Blockage of brown
Losing oxygen to my brain
As my body shuts itself down
Laid out, my cadaver is lifeless
Covered in a pool of my own shit
The stench grows, as flies start to swarm
Claiming my body as the home for their unborn
I bleed, they feed, on me...
Gorge on my shit
Infesting their kind into me, planting their seed
Maggots emerge from my corroding corpse
Devouring every last piece of me
My obsession of filth has turned into reality
