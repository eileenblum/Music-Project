[written by: Jensen/Fitzgerald]

Slowly incisions made, let's begin...
Bloated skin gently creased, stink released
Through openings of a loathly nature
Hints of varicose veins accent purple meat of subfigure
Minuscule itineraries for errorless lesions
Silver is dressed to impress,
Radiant and eager to seperate
Flesh meet silver, may she take your coat?
She glides effortlessly,
Content with the warmth against her sides
Until bone is reached...
Such barricades a breakable fix
Appendages cut to symmetrical fashion
Precision mandatory for this routine
Silver knows no flaw regarding butchery
With every stroke she glistens,
Disassembling she shines,
To truncate is her business
Flayed is splended heap,
Limbs placed in unorthodox postures
Elegance amongst repulsion
Brilliant with a knife
Displaying the fruits of one's labor
