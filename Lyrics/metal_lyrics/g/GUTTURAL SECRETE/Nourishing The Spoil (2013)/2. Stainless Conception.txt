[written by: Thompson/Fitzgerald]

Conception...elegant process to create life
Something pure, beautiful
Grossly molested...
Lovers connection perverse
Mindset rank, filthy cognition to spoil privilige
Unwanting to flesh, demanding is the need for
Partner to ejaculate upon implement shine
"Rub it in", she implores...
Semen rubbed point tickles turgid labia
As timid hand helps to provide slow, full insertion
A tender gasp suggests initial reaction to egregious infiltration
Mind opaque from border line shock
Lovesome cunt walls engross favorable suiter
Each stroke wetter than the next as
Stimulant fluid trickles to nestle puckered bloom
Discomfort addressed with soft palm upon brow
Her eyes depict insecurity, pleading concrete gaze
Look of agony and pleasure merge
Climax close, unconciousness closer
Eyes turn to white as she vomits
Muttered verses of ... "fuck me"
A cold sweat unsues, blade slid from crimson heavy canal
Embracing one another in nauseous drivel
