[written by: Jensen/Fitzgerald]

Oblivious to one's surroundings
Masturbation has lost its appeal
Plentiful crop of the feminine kind
Antagonizes rapist wit
Patience is key for wanted progression
She looks nice...
I'm sure she'll bleed just fine
Light breeze pierces sassy long hair
Cinnamon scent trails behind
Unknowingly escorted home
Location confirmed...
Rock to face meeting to follow
She makes her way to her door
Before she can turn around, her head is caved in
Knees buckled, body collapses
Through the door she is dragged
Leaving a trail of cranial remnants behind
Stripped and spread...
Beatings continue while her body is still warm
Dead with no feeling, but continually raped
Cumming inside her, thumbs press lips to smile
Was it good for you?
I'll cuddle for awhile, but I really must go soon
Carried upstairs, placed and tucked into bed
Kiss to the forehead
I'll call you tomorrow...
