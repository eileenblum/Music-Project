[written by: Thompson/Fitzgerald]

Awaken to cervix lavished with incisive cutlery
Pain endorses silence, yet whimpers seep
Sight blurred, but feeling of wet and warm
Welcomes your touch
No teeth, cracked lips, what once was a sweet mouth
Trickles blood and phlegm
Tear ducts rippling, take in abomination
Your sisters lie scattered amongst you
Most dead, few clinging to life
Ungentle to delicate features,
Engulfed in the rot
Of fellow gender you soak
Completely disrobed you slither across silky insides
Determined to escape,
Yet escape embellishes imagination
The uninviting sound of footsteps pulsate your ears
Through the door comes generous assailant
Introducing his steel toe to your face
Appearance smashed, life drains from
Soft green eyes...life is no more
Your soul belongs to no god,
Your soul belongs to pain
Dead lump of flesh sexually disorganized
Mangled where you were fucked...how ironic
Look what faith has brought you
What's it like to receive no answer?
Do you now see?
