[written by: Jensen/Fitzgerald]

Knife is placed to the skin, carve away...
Insignificant features genetically linked to you upon conception
Self proclaimed impurities urinate the need to butcher
Ones self in foul demeanor
Reluctant to stop, timorous to continue
Integrity of health depletes
Blood loss heavy, yet shearing persists
Scathing pain, but pleased with progress
In her mind, she is stunning, gorgeous
More attractive with each incisive glide
Struggling to hang on she keeps grinning
Achieved perfection gratifying
Ravishing cutting implement receives one final heartfelt lick
As it is placed upon untoughened throat
And slithered to unseal cartilaginous structure
Blood ejected, covering pubescent trinkets across the room
Dead weight plummets, divine decent
Beauty is only a knife away...
