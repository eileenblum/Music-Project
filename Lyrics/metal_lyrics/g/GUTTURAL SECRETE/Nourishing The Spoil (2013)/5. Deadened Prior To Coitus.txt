[written by: Thompson/Fitzgerald]

Lie there, be still...
Do you really love me like you claim to?
Is there nothing in this world you wouldn't do for me?
I have something for you, but you have to trust me...
Tender muscle tissue accedes lank syringe
Potent serum introduced to blood stream
Cadaver function becomes sterile
Your motionless body becomes a canvas for lunacy
A secong thought...irrelevant
Hands wander across flesh so still
Each leg tended to and spread ever so gently
Exposing pulchritudinous slit
So inviting...
Through this exercise, passion and trust is what you seek, but...
Humiliation and degradation is what I give
Grab your face, not so gently, look into your eyes
Softly tell you the the awful deeds you are about to succumb to...
Spread legs pressed back to exposeknotted exit
Tongue laid across exterior
Subtle taste of shit, tastebud inticing...
Accomodates belly full of hot piss
Saliva thin coats starving rectum, below average lubricant
Will suffice...
Ass fucked repeatedly...
Hand ran gently through hair, "You're doing just fine honey.."
Stink tunnel flooded with seminal bliss
Her loves knows no bounds when she has no say...
