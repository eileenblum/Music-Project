[written by: Jensen/Fitzgerald]

Inhale!
Unappealing vulgarity bestowed upon sensual instability
Sense of smell begins to corrode
Becoming partial to this odor...
Exit said values, moral compass disowned, refusal non existent
Cognitive collapse, necrophilia bound, intimate with the breathless
Hands caress this tumescent accumulation of hominal waste
As insertion to epithelial duct is introduced
Can't you see she's blushing? Maybe it's just the rouge...
How about we imperfect this perfection
Hushed anatomy opened up, all goods removed...
Inner beauty gutted, gently placed in silver vessell
Shiny curvature splattered soft crimson shade
Amongst the swell, an over abundance of gingery blubber
Extracted from such a portly bellied up lover
Revel in curtled texture, sieved through fingers
A taste inquired...Dainty!
Corpulent soaked digits graze cold lips
So as to taste herself
Obscenities of sweet distaste whispered violently
Persistent affection to something so un needing
Love struck the moment she was rolled
Through the double doors...
