The scent of perfume over vaginal rot, Stiffens my cock as I dig her grave
in the desert floor. Such a sweet young thing, she thought she was too gorgeous,
For the world, but who's going to want her now? Only a few more feet until this
cunt is gone forever. Once dug, my hole is filled with precious tender pieces,
Of pubescent innocence, ridding the world of, One less cock tease.
