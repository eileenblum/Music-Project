Plus size women jolt my perverse need, To relieve the skin from their bodies.
Telling them that they are gorgeous, I take them home, and fuck them until they puke.
After I am done fucking these fat cunts, I'm disgusted at what I have done.
It makes me sick knowing that I just fucked a fat bitch. Take a blade, gut the bitch,
now she's dead and I'm relieved. Now that she is deceased, it makes me erect,
Knowing that she will be part of me. Take a scalpel, shove it up her asshole.
Slice up to her neck, peel her skin away. Hanging the skin, that I have removed,
To dry and shrink down to my size. Cut the pieces in sections from me to sew.
This garment of skin reeks of pain. Place myself in her god given skin,
Now I have become her. This cadaveric disaster is what I foresee.
Rubbing what's left of her cunt all over me, Looking at myself in the mirror,
Who can say I don't have a feminine side! Would you fuck me, I would fuck me?
