Forensic by trade I clean up the aftermath. Tools in hand searching for the cause of death.
One victim I found was covered in her own shit, With maggots spilling from every orifice.
Aroused by the sight of the white colored parasites, Fixated on the warmth they will bring
to my throbbing cock. Making sure there's no one around to see what I'm gonna do.
Slide my cock into the first hole I come to, The feeling of this penetration. Send me into a
surge of ecstasy. A bitches cunt does not compare, To the truculent grinding of larvae
on me, Fucking me with their teeth, As they feed off my bulging prick. Nibbling penis as
well as excrement. Uncontrollable pumping urging me to cum. Flaccid is my meat pole
from ejaculation. Jarring up the squirming horde. Evidence for my pleasure.
Leaving a few attached to my cock. Body bagging this mound of flesh that I have
Defiled, I am in love with her dead rotten, Gaping holes stuffed with maggots
Off to the morgue goes the love of my life.
