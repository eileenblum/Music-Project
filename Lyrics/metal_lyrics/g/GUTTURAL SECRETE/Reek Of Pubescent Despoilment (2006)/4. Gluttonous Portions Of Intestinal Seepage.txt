Scouring the morgue for the grossly obese. Find the chamber where they keep
the frozen meat. Slabs full of numerous bodies to feast upon. I must get them to gorge
on what's inside. Stuffing my face... With their intestines... Filling... my guts... with theirs.
Gluttonizing all their organs, I rape the flesh of the deceased. Fixated with the taste of
this seepage, That leaks from my mouth, Stomach full of human intestines,
I have no room for more, Packing up what's left of the fat fuckers guts,
Filling large containers to add to my stock, Freezers at my home are restocked
every year, With gluttonous portions of intestinal waste.
