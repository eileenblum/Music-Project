Obsessing over piss and shit, Fecal orgy shit stained I sit. Gagging from the stench so vile
Suffocating with a smile, Puking on myself, regurgitating fecal matter. Feels like razor blades
carving up my throat. Self indulgent narcissism, giving myself deep incisions.
Mixing shit with my blood. Blood clots begin to form in my veins from the blockage of brown.
Losing oxygen to my brain as my body shuts itself down. Laid out, my cadaver is lifeless.
Covered in a pool of my own shit. The stench grows, as flies start to swarm, Claiming my body
as the home for their unborn, I bleed, they feed, on me, gorge on my shit, Infesting their kind
into me, planting their seed. Maggots emerge from my corroding corpse
Devouring every last piece of me. My obsession of filth has turned to reality.
