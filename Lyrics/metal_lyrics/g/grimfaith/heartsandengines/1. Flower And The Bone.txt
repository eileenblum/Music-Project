[Feat. Lisa Johansson]

[Creepy Crawlers (Intro)]

âIt wasn't fair
A clumsy father's fist
And little me
Unable to resist
And I was locked again
He used to mock
Into the deepest basement
Of a raw rock
A basement store
And little me in vain
Those creepy crawlers
Used to entertain
They told me stories
Of the Flower and the Bone
They used to feed me
With the bodies of their ownâ

[Verse 1:]
It seems that fatherâs near, alone
To start an ultraviolence show
Why don't you come and sidle up to me?
I've got a gift to turn it real - a fantasy

[Chorus 1:]
The silence is not aloud
The scream I need
I want it now and here

In silence I can't exist
No reason why
My angel is a freak

[Verse 2:]
Why are you standing here alone, alone?
You are the meaning of the show, the show
Why don't you come and sidle up to me?
I've got a gift to turn it real - a fantasy

[Chorus 2 (with Lisa)]

Why donât you come and sidle up to me
I've got a gift to turn it real - a fantasy

[Chorus 3 (with Lisa)]
