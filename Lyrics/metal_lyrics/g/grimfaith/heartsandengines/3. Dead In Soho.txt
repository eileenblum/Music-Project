[Chorus 1 :]
Call me, lovely Reaper
Deeper into the City
And Iâll be your pet, Yeah
Until Iâm dead,
Until Iâmâ¦

[Verse:]
Dead in SOHO
And the world is getting hollow
Dead â there was no higher plan for me
Dead in SOHO
Iâm the God, Iâm Andy Warhol
Dead â Iâve suffered plans for everyone myself

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Here we are at the suburbs
Of the Art World
Here we are at the home of sorrow
Masters â Disasters

[Chorus]
