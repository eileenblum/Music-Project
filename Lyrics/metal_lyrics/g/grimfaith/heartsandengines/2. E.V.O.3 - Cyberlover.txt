[Verse 1:]
There is nothing wrong with a cyber-skin
Critical caress after inner sin
Will I get a cure for my loneliness?
Who is going to share my last breath?

E.V.O. â 3!
And I am ready to believe
Opens the source of all
And I receive forbidden joy

[Chorus:]
Cyber Lover
Is ALWAYS waiting for me
Is ALWAYS waiting for me

[Verse 2:]
Ready? She always is!
As a priest to remit a sin
Ready and always will
I can realize she'll never stop for me

Turn on the love machine
Let me dream the greatest sodomy
E.V.O. â a sonic queen
Make me realize that life is not for me

[Chorus]
Cyber Lover
Is ALWAYS waiting for me
Is ALWAYS waiting for me
Cyber Lover
Is ALWAYS waiting for me
Is ALWAYS waiting for me

[Verse 3:]
When I get you
I get wet you
Weak to start again
But you can

Can't restrain you
Or repair you
Late to shut you down
Cause it's aching â AAAAA!!!

[Chorus]
