Time is now for me to close my eyes
Love is gone, the flowers wither, the poet dies
Excellence - the perfect wound is done by my own hand
Music plays I hear the melody that I had left

Leave me alone in this life
Leave me alone, don't leave me alone
In this sacred chamber of love
Leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Without you I'm dying
Leave me alone in this life

Light me the way to the places of rebirth
Shiva, let me feel your breath behind
And present me your eternal wings
Shadow man -
I am standing between the ruins of my heart

Take my flesh and choose the better form for me to live in
From your words I know - you won't reject my future being
As I fall back to the bottom of your fire pillar
Memories of love will be the last drop in the ocean of my despair

Leave me alone in this life
Leave me alone, don't leave me alone
In this sacred chamber of love
Leave me alone, don't leave me alone
As I open my arms
Take me alone from this life
