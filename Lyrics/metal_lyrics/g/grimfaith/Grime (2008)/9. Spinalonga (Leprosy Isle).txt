Prague and Paris, Venice and Rome
Everywhere praised
But nowhere loved at all
Big land is lost behind, this wind I trust
New shores on my horizon
And sail is fast

Shall I find
Place for a slow suicide?
No shadows where I can hide
I leave my stormy life behind
Spinalonga
Shall I find
Place where my loving mother died?
I'll leave my stormy life behind
No shadows where I can hide
Leprosy Isle

Life and smoke - I stand between
Watch them burning
Somebody on a hill
These pity faceless - eyes full of fear
Remind my parents
Do I belong here?

Genius child of eternity,
I burn my senses in vain
World's darkness comes out victorious
Vanish my soul! Fall the rain!
