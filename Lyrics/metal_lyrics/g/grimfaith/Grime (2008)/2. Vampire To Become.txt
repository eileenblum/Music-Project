Come to me
My beautiful
My blood stream
Is under your rule
Come to me
Accept my call
Your gothic grace
Is what I'm longing for

I can feel
The pain in your eyes
You burn your flesh
By mortal drugs
I can see
Your eyelashes black
And small young holes
On your white neck

Vampire to become
I'll live to feed my burden
This is an order
The evil rule will never fall
Vampire to become
Azure of life is over
Under the cover
Under the cover of the night

Come to me
Accept my call
Your gothic grace
Is what I'm longing for
Come to me
Oh, pretty face
So very tight
Is your embrace

You can be
The princess of night
Dressed in black
With a frozen heart
Come to me
My beautiful
My blood stream
Is under your rule
