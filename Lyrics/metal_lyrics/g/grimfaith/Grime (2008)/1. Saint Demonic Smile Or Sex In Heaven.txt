She invited me to travel underworld
She is wearing air and a head of goat
Music in her words, fire in her breast
Yet she's not the dweller of Earth - She is a guest

She gave me a chance to feel her inner flame
Moving gently in dance the passion came
Power of her charming saint-demonic smile
Made me feel like drowning in the sands of time

Back to the 7th Circle of Heaven
Back to the 7th Circle of Heaven
Love on the 7th Circle of Heaven
Making the wild Sex in Heaven with You

She is on her knees shivering her tongue
Saint-demonic kiss shades my sun
Almost satisfied victim 69
I discover sacred blood in her arm

She invited me to travel underworld
She is wearing air and a head of goat
Music in her words, fire in her breast
Yet she's not the dweller of Earth - She is a guest

She is on her knees shivering her tongue
Saint-demonic kiss shades my sun
Almost satisfied victim 69
I discover sacred blood in her arm
