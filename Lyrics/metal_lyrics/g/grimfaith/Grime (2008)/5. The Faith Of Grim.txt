Look into my eyes, free out your lust and swallow me
Beauty is my beast - the evil seed that kills me
Look into my eyes, free out your lust and swallow me
Beauty is my beast - the evil seed that kills me

Grim Faith be my sail, blow hard wind full of ash!

Witches and demons, chaos and fears
Enter my deep dark place
Father of horror, hangman and lover
Enter my Grim Faith
Wolf cubs and babies, vampyric ladies
(Are) welcomed to my abyss
Never reflected, (by) evil created
Join me in Grim Faith

Look into my eyes, free out your lust
Beauty is my beast - the evil seed
Look into my eyes, free out your lust and swallow me
Beauty is my beast - the evil seed that kills me

Grim Faith be my sail, blow hard wind full of ash!
