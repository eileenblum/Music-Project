From the razor's blade smiles the demon
Saying the words of the end
Under the blooming season
Nailed to the cross is the kindest Saviour
Nailed hangs the son of the shadow Nothing

So kiss his feet, eat
Eat the dust by your spit tongue
And bleed, bleed, bleed
In the cradle of flesh you'll say

Nothing's left to decide Nothing's left to live for
Nothing left to believe
Nothing left to cry for
Nailed to the cross is the kindest Saviour
Nailed hangs the son of the shadow Nothing

Brightest ever sunshine's in the shade of mother's cries
Funeral of last hope
Entering the raven's eyes
Tongues of disbelievers drowning in the sweetest lies
Funeral of last hope entering the raven's eyes
So kiss his feet, eat
Eat the dust by your spitted tongue

The demon with your heart.
