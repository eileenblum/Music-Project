Secret of the sea, secret of time - no one remembers
Secret of lives - never-ending
Secret of her face, secret of love - no one ever felt
Secret of her heart - a pearl red

O-oh, Guttiere - sea of beauty
O-oh, Guttiere - cast your spell on me
Love of a 1000 mermaids I'll give for your kiss
Fall in love with the devil, nothing evil in this

Secret of the sea, secret of time - no one remembers
Secret of lives - never-ending
Secret of her smile, burning lips - no one ever kissed
Secret of her flesh - my body needs
