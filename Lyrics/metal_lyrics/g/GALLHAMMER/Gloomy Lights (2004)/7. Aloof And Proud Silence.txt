I hear scream of doom. Tears, name of lie. I stand in the silence.
Torture, we must play war. Our father gave us torments. Endless. I hope world dies.
Here is no peace. Never die hypocrisy. Hopeless, we may day. Darkness is glowing. 
I stand at the edge of the hopeless. I await the end of everything.
Aloof and proud silence. Endless nauseous days.
Now we stand alone. We must go on. With pride and hate.
