The hands rise up into the setting sun
The unbeknown thoughts, I look for it
The land is missing
The dusk, the cries, the scared

The last prayer, not to reach
Thus the thing I saw
The eternity, the darkness, the pleasure
I fall to the cold bottom

Oh dirty my hands
Oh dirty my flesh
Oh dirty your hands
Oh dirty your flesh

The way to the end
Glow away eternally
The land, dusk is seen
The fear, the hands, it doesn't reach

Oh the unbeheld fate

I keep walking
