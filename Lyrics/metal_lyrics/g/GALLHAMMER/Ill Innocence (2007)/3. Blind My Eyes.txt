My eyes blind
My ears deaf

Please blind my eyes
Lasting colors torment me
Please deafen my ears
Auditory hallucinations torment me

My eyes blind
My ears deaf

Please take away my body and soul
Permanent scars torment me
Please deafen my ears
Auditory hallucinations torment me

I did not want to notice it
I who am ugly
I who am dirty
Please stop it
When will my confession end?

I do not want to look anymore
I do not want to hear it anymore
When will my confession end?

However, it is me entirely
