Usual white dream, I saw it there
I forgot what I saw
White cloud, I saw a little while ago
What is it?
Where is it?
And...
No sounds, no sounds
There is nothing, it doesn't reach
In there, the place there
I was in there a little while ago
Is it wrong?
What am I?

White
Light
Heat

Awesome, not broken
It's your hands, let me go
Awesome, not clear
It's my mind, delete it

It is wrong, it is wrong
I can't hear
Well, whatever, I saw it a little while ago
White dream that I saw a little while ago
There is nothing, there was nothing
And...
Come and go, come and go
There is nothing, there is nowhere
However...
I don't know, I don't know
Like I said, I was killed a little while ago
White of midday sunshine

White
Addict
Junks

Awesome, not clear
It's my mind, delete it
Awesome, I can't see
So that...
