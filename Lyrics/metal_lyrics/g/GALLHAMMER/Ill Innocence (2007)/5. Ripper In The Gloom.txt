Break your inner fear
Break it by yourself
Never afraid, keep your mind
Never, keep your life

It's up to you
Not afraid
No one helps you
Ripper in the gloom

Run away and hide
Cry for someone's help
The cry is never reached
Break it by yourself

It's up to you
Not afraid
No one helps you
Ripper in the gloom

Yami wo kirisake
Your life is in your hands
