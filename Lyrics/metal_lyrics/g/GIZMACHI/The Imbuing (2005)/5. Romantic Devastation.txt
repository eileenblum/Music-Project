Same just a game I'd like nothing more
Than to make you my whore you're denied
Your pride denied

Compensate separate stimulate my escape
Sever my god, these clothes off,
Such a cheap thrill, pleasure is nil

Take her back to a place she wants to be... not here with me

Again the same just a game played
Together stability remains denied
Your pride denied
Taken back to a place... alone I strive

Thriving towards things I could never
Change or shape I'll try forever
Romantic devastation
I've drawn my new demon
Romantic devastation
