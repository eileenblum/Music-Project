Hold on. drop. I won't go.
Symbolic tendencies exist predictable this declaration
Is my fist I will not fear demise
I cannot be demise blot out and obliterate
Hold on.
Erase and exterminate hold on
I forgot annihilation. hold on. I am now. determination.
Hold on. or drop. there's nothing left.
Wandering eyes will roam. it's all the same falling farther home.
Hold on. don't forget me
Death's eyes forming my time so alone
This is what death sounds like
