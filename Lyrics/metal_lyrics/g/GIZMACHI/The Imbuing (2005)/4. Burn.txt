Burn
Silence, mesmerize, minds twist and blur my
Eyes
Control is not something that I possess
So tell whose turn I lied, I lied, I lied
Again disgusted grunt thought inside my head
Who would never try to tread, disease is called
Knowledge inside I'm dead burn.
I can defy.
Revolting repulsive shocking the notion
That I can defy the waves in the ocean.
Close your eyes confide, see what's in your eyes
Round again walk inside my friend, kick me down now,
Straight through my hea, relive the pain
That digests my brain...
Come on I've gone insane
Are we dead? this cannot be, learn to live life without me,
We have learned prophets can see
Everything in spite of me... burn
I know that you know... so don't follow me.
My divine prolong your death, you will burn
