Prolong the agony
Judgment verdict guilty
I love the taste of blood
Open wide look inside

Sail away, fade away, gone astray, ive got more
Enemies just for one day yet I pray
I just pray to me
I have this pain, want to wash it away
Men of cloth that are demons within... just wearing skin
I just pray to me then I learn
I open your eyes, I found nothing inside
I love the taste of blood
Closed this time colorize

Divide dooms fine
Fever burns warm
Observe the cure
