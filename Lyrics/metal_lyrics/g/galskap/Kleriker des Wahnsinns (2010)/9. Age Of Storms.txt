A hellish kind of terror
Deferred by archfiends
Its only destination:
ItÂ´s to create - hate

Infesting sacred place
The meaning of hope destructed
Despairing calls - futile
Aggressive attitude to life

Naivety - their death

Canting reverend of doom
Ruptures the remaining resistances
Immortal rage awaken
Light forces betrayed
