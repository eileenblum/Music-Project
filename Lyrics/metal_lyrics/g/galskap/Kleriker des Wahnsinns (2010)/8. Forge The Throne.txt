No more chains of flesh
No more divine ruler
No more sacred traitor
No more Christianity
No more god - you bitch
Earth no more

No more pretender
Neither hate nor scorn
Break down all rules
Break down that so called
Humanity

Rise and ignite
Destroy the old order
Create your own throne
Of justice and sin
Set up the flag of dominion
Conquer this fucked up world

Forge the throne
From blood and skulls
Set up the flag of dominion
Conquer this world
It's all in your hands:
"All aimless life has to burn"
