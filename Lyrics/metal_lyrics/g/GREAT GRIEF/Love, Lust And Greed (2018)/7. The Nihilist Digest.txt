Wandering mouth, this is the best night of your life.
The bottle saved
You but it's all a fucking lie.
This is the end of your days, so fuck off, it's time to leave.
I am leaving behind an empty shell to remember my life.
The next time I sleep, the world won't bother me.
This is the nihilist digest, my self loathing confession.
This is it, we pass no judgement.
To those who feel used and abused, the ego burns your skin.
You're boiling from inside.
Painstakingly beautiful and toxic.
I'm in love with your vanity.
Your mother fucked like Monroe.
Your father danced like Mick Jagger.
So let her drink 'til she dies
'Cause to him nothing matters.
Cure my ache.
I'm jaded 'til the end of days and I see no fucking end, Christ.
We are the all singing, dancing crap of the earth.
What's the point.
Put your head in the sand.
All you have is broken skin, now try and fucking live with it.
Well I have to say I'm happy you don't like me.
Life's a bitch, but it's easy.
You're pathetic, I'm leaving
