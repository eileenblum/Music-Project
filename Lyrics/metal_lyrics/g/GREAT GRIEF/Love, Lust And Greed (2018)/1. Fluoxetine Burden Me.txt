Months of self-reflection gone down the drain.
You're back to your old ways, burden me until I break.
How does it feel to love me but push me away.
How does it feel to abuse me, turning me every day.
What's left to do with you, now that you're alone?
Why must I bury you, now that you're my home?
I see your pale reflect my broken ego,
And your frail glass-prone skin suits your well-endowed blood flow.
There's so much fire in your heartâ¦
Too bad I'll water it down.
I wish I could take you as my own, but I'm already gone.
Without you I don't live, I barely flow.
Without you I don't breathe, wither and bloat.
Open the curtain, watch the show.
A tale of two, becoming a singular whole and bleeding out.
