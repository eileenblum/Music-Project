I'm feeling fine, I'm buried deep.
Mouthful of pills helps me sleep in peace.
Yeah I look fine, but I'm not well.
My mind withholds a personal hell.
My eyes sink down to sea, as they swim and float far beyond your reach.
And I know I'll never be OK with this mental crutch, a half a gram a day.
Born tired and mentally weak.
I am the damage that dwells real deep.
What's the point of being alone if I regret every thought of being born.
Let me learn to love myself.
Let me learn not to despise myself.
And it'll all be fine, just go and close your eyes.
No excuses left, still filled with hate.
Pulling my hair out with every step.
I can not leave this house, my only window of peace, shut with blackened sheets.
The breeding life form within these walls is much more alive than me.
What's the point of being born, if I can't even be alone.
Let me learn to love myself.
Let me learn not to despise myself.
Yeah, pills make me feel like home.
Born tired and mentally weak.
I am the damage that dwells real deep.
What's the point of being born if I can't even be alone.
Let me learn to love myself.
Let me learn to be alone.
