Love is lust and greed, but for her I'll bleed out.
I'm a stranger to every single person that I meet.
So wrap this belt around my neck and pull until I sleep.
I would give anything to go back and fix that sinking ship.
Broken hearts never match, a burning house, never a home again.
Let me sleep, plagued for me.
And I swear to you, if you're reading this.
I'll never bother you, I'll take these feelings (deep down) and learn to accept it.
"How unselfish and apathetic"
"The roses in your hands turned into rusty nails, but I can see the sparks inside of you"
This isn't love, it's abuse.
Rushing, convulsing, bleeding out.
Remission ends in grief and drags you down.
Salivating, your rush it finds new pray.
Now she can't live with herself.
So another family grieves.
I would give anything to go back and fix that sinking ship.
Broken hearts never match, a burning house never a home again.
Let me grieve, plagued by me.
