Your teeth fall out of your mouth.
No sense in keeping anything in.
Your senses numbed by your dulled youth.
You're beaten, black, bloody and blue.
Inhale the smoke, shortening your life by the minutes.
Your blood, it pours from your mouth.
How far did she get under your skin.
You're crying and she has left you.
And now your malice controls you.
Inhale the smoke shortening your life by the minutes.
Burn your skin.
I come alive holding back every thought that I've had.
This isolation is hell.
The soil black, walls of glass, hailstorms of self dread.
This isolation is hell.
I grab my belt, wrap it tightly around my neck.
There is no peaceful way out.
I kick the chair from my feet.
This is how I go out.
This isolation is hell.
This isolation is home.
