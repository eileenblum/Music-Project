My body riddled with a fever of doubt, I can't shake the feeling I'm burning out.
Your presence left a bitter taste in my mouth.
Take a new shape when your shine goes down.
Love lead us to burning buildings in abandoned towns, though it was meaningless, there's still truth to be found.
Watch me dull my body to death, with pills, alcohol and meaningless sex.
This is my pathetic leisure, a way to deal my self doubt.
This white lie I will tell myself.
I'll find meaning when the days are done, I'll find meaning when I'm not around.
Ivory lie;
You're my manic vice.
Deceitful eyes; you're my manic muse.
I see you begging, dancing for my gaze.
Your fingers twitching, skin sags/hangs off your face.
I took my life into my hands, you wasted your breath for days.
A pointless compulsive endeavour, did you ever make a change.
Church filled with lovers, who won't remember you.
Your bourgeois vanity trail, resembles an empty funeral.
Cut the power and end the charade and leave this life you made.
Step foot into the living room, the one you never go into.
Centered a shallow grave,
Filled with the lives you claimed.
There's a lesson to be learned, from every bridge you burned.
Stay silver; not gold.
Because in the end it's not what will unfold.
