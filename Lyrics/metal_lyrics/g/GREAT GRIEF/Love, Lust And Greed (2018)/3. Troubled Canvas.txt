Things have been going the wrong way, since we realised there was no right way.
So let me rewind to the startâ¦
Your most-compelling argument was the day we drifted apart.
"I don't want to love anyone else, but I've had trouble even loving myself"
Things have been going the wrong way,
Was there ever a fucking right way?
I am forever drifting apart.
I'd leave but I've been dragging my heels since the start of it all.
I am beyond pathetic, just like you.
You took all my troubles away with your art.
Spread it across a canvas, made universes out of malice, grandeur and harm.
Pale and blue, but red at the roots of it all.
Pale and blue, blood red at the roots of it all.
Things have been going the wrong way, since we realised there was no right way.
So I've got to move on from this art.
Your most compelling argument was the day that you gave me back my life.
So watch me leave with stride.
