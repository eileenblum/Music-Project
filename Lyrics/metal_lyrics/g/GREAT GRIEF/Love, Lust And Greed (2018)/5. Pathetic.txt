Grab me by my wounded neck, you look so tired lover.
Become the beast with two scarred backs, you look so bothered lover.
A genderless nymphs short-sighted dream, you look so flustered lover.
Is the promiscuous man's war.
You look so menacing lover.
Feel my slithering tongue wipe the floor of your stomach.
I look pathetic and I act so greedy in this light
Can you see my scars in this dress, you look so manic lover.
Must you trace the blistered lines, you look so burnt out lover.
Can there be one more secret time, do you feel cheated lover.
I am an addict of your light.
Did you find consent when you spiked her drink,
Was it fizzing to the top as she took a sip,
Has this question not been answered before,
Taste the bitter truth and walk out the door.
As your axe falls to rest, her body begins to quake, as your axe rises yet again.
Her head is in your hands again.
