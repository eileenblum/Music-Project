Her lips drew life from the world, red coated, blood bloated.
A voice of malice taught me malice ways and we're trying not to make them stay.
Faux born, ivory divorce.
The palest ghost I've ever seen.
I'm sick of waging war against my fucking self.
Let it happen, let them bury me.
You sit there trashing your vertebrae, while crying over the magistrate.
There's no room for you or your lack of perspective.
Right speech, wrong ways.
You've been here for way too long, and now I can't fucking stay.
Her lips drew life from the world, red coated, blood bloated.
A voice of malice taught me malice ways and we're trying not to make them stay.
What is life.
What is love.
You've been here for way too long and now you can't fucking stay.
Sick of waging war against my fucking self.
I can't even think straight anymore.
Wrong speech, wrong ways.
You've been here for too long and now you can't stay.
