It's what you fear the most
It is the thing you see
In your worst nightmares
Haunts you
Stalks you
Finds you
Take you from this world
Plotting it's next move
As you plans yours

There is nowhere to hide
Nowhere is safe
You will be taken in when it's least expected
Snatched up without a trace
You'll have no fucking clue

Where you're [2x]
Being taken [2x]
But the pain that awaits
Is worse than any Hell
[2x]

You will be torn to shreds
As your soul is harvested
As you take your
Last breath

The last thing you'll see
Death came
In the form of your self
