[feat. Dan Watson]There is no father
Everything you've been told is a lie
My soul is fucking black
There's no savior left for purity
Everywhere I turn
I fall deeper into this hole
Into the depths of
This dark shadow that stalks me
It is my fate to rot here in my own personal hell.
Everlasting pain of realizing my existence
Means absolutely nothing
I wish I could stop this feeling
Fuck
I'm just fiending please give me a answer
A way to abruptly end this shit
To fucking cut all the ties
You say you're in the dark
I am the fucking dark
I bring all life to it's knees
And that's what sets us apart
I am the fucking dark
I am the one who has been clawing at the inside of your skull
My broken nails slowly etching trails into your bone
You were never alone
I've been watching you
Incubating inside the womb of your rotting mind
Your soul is mine
