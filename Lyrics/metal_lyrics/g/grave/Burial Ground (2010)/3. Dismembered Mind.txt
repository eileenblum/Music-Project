Born from the hidden
The dark and the suppressed
A lifetime of misery
in the ranks of the oppressed

In my skin I pen my sins
the burden of penance carved in flesh
My body is a map of pain
a scar ridden wasteland

I regret reciting forgiveness
I repent cutting deep not to forget

Mutilation for absolution
to avoid the horrors of damnation
My pain and blood will bring
salvation and humiliation

A festering sickness
that rages inside
From birth of fragile flesh
to decay upon the cross

I regret reciting forgiveness
I repent cutting deep not to forget
In my skin I pen my sins
the burden of penance carved in flesh
My body is a map of pain
a scar ridden wasteland

Born from the hidden
The dark and the suppressed
A lifetime of misery
In the ranks of the oppressed
A festering sickness
that rages inside
From birth of fragile flesh
to decay upon the cross
