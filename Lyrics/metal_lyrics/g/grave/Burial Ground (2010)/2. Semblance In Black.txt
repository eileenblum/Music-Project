Visitor in my dawning sleep
comes to me without a sign
A semblance in black.
Silent as ice with visions
of hell and despair

Persuading and leering
to gain my consent
to show me the fiery pits
sent from a world
of torment and wrath!

Collecting the borderline minds
collecting my borderline mind to control
expecting oppression for life
companion in black.

persuasive through silence
expecting obedient reign

Join me, Take me
show me the fiery pits of hell
take me home!
Show me the fiery pits of torment
I beg of thee
Hear my final cry

collecting my borderline mind to control
expecting oppression for life
companion in black,
persuasive through silence
expecting obedient reign
Join me
Take me
