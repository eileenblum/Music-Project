"This place is a tomb." [Event Horizon]

On the trail of spirits realm
far beneath the sacred ground
I was lost but now I`m lost!
Roam the night with hollow eyes

Take my soul
Hear my pledge
Set me free
Burial ground!

Seen my name carved in stone
Withered flowers by my head
All around me saddened cries
Conversations into thin air.

Hear my pledge
Set me free from the burial ground
Let me rest far below
The burial ground

Remembering clearly
Leaving the physical realms
I was lost but now I`m lost
With the moon as my only friend
I pursue my quest for blood

Doomed and cursed to roam the night
Forever dead, yet alive
Remembering clearly
Leaving the physical realms
I was lost but now I`m lost!
