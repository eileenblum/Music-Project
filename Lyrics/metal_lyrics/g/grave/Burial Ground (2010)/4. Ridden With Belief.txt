Sentenced forever
to a life in deceit
For my bloodline it`s destiny
slave to the holy

Disciples and creed
The blood of Christ given to me
Church of sin behind
the front of holiness
Crosses cry forgiveness

In the night
Fornication, mastication, willingly
To please the lord.
Keep it in the family
hidden behind sanctity
ridden with belief

Sentenced forever to a life in deceit
For my bloodline it`s destiny
Slave to the holy disciples and creed
The blood of Christ given to me
hidden behind sanctity
ridden with belief

Church of sin behind
the front of holiness
Crosses cry forgiveness in the night
Fornication, mastication,
strangulation, holy nation
Corrupted and blinded
Accepted within
The covent of Christ!
