Centuries of hate
Has passed since the dawn of me
I have seen the future - infinity
Demonic since birth,
I haunt your mind and crave your flesh
Hell on earth, hails through me

Death and decay follow my steps,
mayhem my friend
I have ruled the fields of plague
Sardonic rage flows inside
my charred burning heart
hell on earth - Endlessly

Demonic since birth
haunting your dreams
Sardonic rage
Hell on earth, hails through me

Conqueror
Centuries of hate
has passed since the dawn of me
Stripping your minds from your sanity
ripping your minds for eternity

Demonic since birth
haunting your dreams
Sardonic rage
hell on earth, hails through me!
