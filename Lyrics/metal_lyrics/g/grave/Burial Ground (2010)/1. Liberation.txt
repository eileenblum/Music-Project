Finally here to walk down the path
Bloody steps towards the light
Staggering on through my last breath
fallen I am, and frail
Transformation of my lost soul
As spirits breed

Regenerated through a dark mind
bright turns to black
white turns to red
as the angels weep
my soul is raped repeatedly
fallen I will remain

Liberation of my lost soul
spirits bleed
generated through a dark mind
godspeed!

Scarred I was born
from religion and faith
my hearts belief so fake
dark side oppressed
and expressed silently
forlorn eternally

expected to follow the blinded flock
rebellion overload
devotion, diverting a killing spree
forlorn finally
bright turns to black
white turns to red
my soul is raped repeatedly
fallen I reign as I revel

Through bloodstained skies
transformation of my lost soul
as spirits breed
regenerated through a dark mind
bleed!
