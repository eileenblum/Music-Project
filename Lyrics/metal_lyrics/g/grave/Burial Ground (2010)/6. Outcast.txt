Famished and pale
a fraction of his glory days
Bloodshot eyes
Knowing nor pleasure or pain

Lost in a dream
To walk among the chosen ones
Forever saved
To struggle in filth and obey

Live by my words and you will be saved
aroused by the mass
Excused to fulfill his holy sin
Deranged Sympathy
For those less fortunate ones
Exceeding his goals
He wanders the crossroad
of faith and despair

A reject of pride
Outcast, sinner
Selected by might
The glory of god
Can`t save you now
You struggle in filth
Verming, blashphemer

Ferever a slave
Enjoy your heavenly stay
Live by my hand
and you will be saved
Wander the crossroad
of faith and despair
