Far beyond this world they take me in my dreams,
To the point of no return,
Ripping of flesh and beliefs,
Countless dead I see.

As they rise before me,
By demons bred,
Bodyparts they feed me,
For the very first time.

Time is on my side this feast will never end,
On this night of glory,
Ripping of flesh and beliefs,
The fallen angels I see.

And they gather around me,
By demons bred,
My first kill they bring me,
At last some peace of mind.

How I wish that this was not a dream,
I would give up anything to be,
One of those who brings me every night,
Far away solitary.

Countless days have gone, I'm longing for my sleep,
So that they can bring me,
Back to the place of my beliefs,
Back to my reality.

Please don't wake me,
I feel the flames,
Please don't judge me,
Hell is here for me and you will pay.

Strapped down to save me from myself,
You can't lock my mind away.
