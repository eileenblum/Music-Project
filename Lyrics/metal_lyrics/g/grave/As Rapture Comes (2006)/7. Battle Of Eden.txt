Sinful nature in the holy garden of delight,
Spawn of purity and insanity,
Weakened followers searching since the dawn of time,
Slaves to the grind and the word of god.

Charge!

Fallen from the skies leader of the battlefront,
Charging forward with the blackest of souls,
Hatred in their eyes and hatred in their hearts,
Eagerly awaiting holy genocide.

Charge!

Just follow the demon and prepare to join,
The battle of Eden.

Screams are silent now where was the grace of your god,
Lustful burning feast will forever reign,
Sinful nature in the holy garden of delight,
Was it all you were told about paradise.

Just follow the demon and prepare to join,
The battle of Eden.
