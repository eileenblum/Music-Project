Hellcome to the end,
Suffering by my side,
Believe in what you want,
The final judgement has arrived.

In vain you'll beg for salvation,
Your pain is what I thrive.

Flames by your side,
Watching the angels die,
I'm free I chose my side,
Your final breath is soon to be.

In vain you turn to the skies,
Your pain is what I thrive.

Earth in ruins,
Christ wiped out,
Domination,
Has begun.

Domination,
Has begun,
Salvation,
In the eternal fire.

Hellcome my dear friend,
You're free on our side,
The feast has just begun,
Forever dead is heavenly.

In life you reached for the light,
Below the darkness we thrive.
