Sinner walk my path,
Paved with the ashes of corpses,
Strangled mangled by my hand,
Bloodshed in the name of your god.

Slow I will crush your dreams,
Flesh is all I need.

Father forgive me for my sins,
It didn't take long for the pain to kick in,
Stangle mangled by my hand,
Raped and torn to shreds of life.

Slow you will bleed for me,
Flesh is all for me.

Join me hear the laughter of hate,
As I watch the burning angels.

Join me through eternity,
Fear me through eternity.

Father bleed for me,
Flesh is all that I need.

Fear me through eternity,
As I burn the watching angels.
