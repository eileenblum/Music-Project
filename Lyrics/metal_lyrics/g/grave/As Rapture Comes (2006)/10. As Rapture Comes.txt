The holy prophecies of the end of days,
Sacred epiphany they follow blindly,
Without exception or doubt.

Waiting for centuries for a sign to come,
The true believer alive or dead,
Shall join the angels to meet their holy one.

Hell is here.

Hell on earth for seven years,
I see them fall to the ground,
As rapture comes.

Dawn is rising across the land demons from below,
Soon to be the leaders of the place you call home,
Awaited afterlife in heaven you won't find,
Hell is here.

Seven years of sodomy seven years of dusk,
I watch my bloody hands and shiver in lust,
The reign of Satan across the earth,
Is the beginning of the end.

Your holy prophecies came to end today,
True believer alive and dead,
Fall from heaven into the fiery pits.

Hell is here.

Hell on earth forevermore,
I turn the crosses,
As rapture comes.
