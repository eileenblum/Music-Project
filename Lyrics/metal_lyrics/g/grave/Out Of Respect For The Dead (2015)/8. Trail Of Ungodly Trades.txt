Gathered here again to embrace the night,
to summon spirit and beast,
the coven is my family through ties of blood,
connecting Heaven and Hell

Trading their lascivious thoughts for immortality,
demons lurk in every soul biding their time

Speaking in tongues and rolling their eyes
in search for secrets and truth,
as the candles flicker and the walls cry blood
the passage opens once again

Set the beast free,
embrace his hate,
summoning the dead,
summoning the dead

Hollow eyes around me, I smell their putrid breath,
returning to what once was their home,
relatives, fugitives, murderers and thieves,
eager to return in human form

Gathered here again to embrace the night
to summon spirit and beast,
as the candles flicker and the walls cry blood,
the passage opens once again

Trading their lascivious thoughts for immortality,
demons lurk in every soul biding their time
