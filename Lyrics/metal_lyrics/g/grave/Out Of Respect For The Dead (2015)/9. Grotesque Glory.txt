I arise from the dark rotten soil,
awoken from my restless sleep,
slowly my limbs regain control again,
claws of doom, crackling of bones

I remember the days
when I ruled all living, dead and foul,
regaining my strength for centuries,
it is time to strike and rise

Rise my friend, our battle awaits to be fought again,
my years of lust grows stronger by each day,
raise the dead, take me to where our worlds collide,
our force of death will conquer all that breathe

With staggering steps I stumble through this land of ash, fire and gore
seeking my true companion of death,
his severed head beneath my feet, I curse the gods of all living, dead and foul,
forever trapped in this wasteland of grotesque glory

Rise my friend, our battle awaits to be fought again,
my years of lust grows stronger by each day,
raise the dead, take me to where our worlds collide,
our force of death will conquer all that breathe

Ripping through the night in anger, slashing through the fields,
fields of black and dormant mud where blood once flowed,
streams of fire glowing cold with an everlasting hope
to redeem our fallen warriors and the dreams of nevermore

Rise,
raise the dead,
rise

With staggering steps I walk across the lake of frozen blood,
cursed to forever roam this land, my kingdom restored

Rise my friend, our battle awaits to be fought again,
my years of lust grows stronger by each day,
raise the dead, take me to where our worlds collide,
our force of death will conquer all that breathe
