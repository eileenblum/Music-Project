Far below the living in a plain pine box
I was put to rest for their sanctuary,
the bells they ring but not for me,
forced to pay my sins in holy remedy

But my eyes still bleed
and my hands are clinched
Far below the sun,
buried on these hallowed grounds

Terror in their eyes at the sight of my remains,
unearthly wounds and scars,
ignoring my last wish to remain godless and free,
they wash their hands of me

Exhume my bones and take me home,
far from the cries of the dead,
save my soul from this sacred ground,
I see the smiles of the dead,
I'm forced below against my will,
reveled by illusions of my last will
