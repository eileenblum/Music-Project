Lurking in the shadows on the prowl again
to satisfy my need for rotten limbs,
the moon is my companion shedding light upon the pale,
I dig and crawl in stinking soil to feast again

The night is calm and quiet now, my grunts the only sound,
I found what I am looking for again,
affection towards rotting flesh is my sick deed,
these people still need comforting and care

My new friend unveiled,
age and gender unknown,
the rush of desecration
in my veins

Forced to accept my command,
death cannot be the end
so I gather their bones for a feast,
Out of respect for the dead

Out of respect for the dead,
Out of respect for the dead,
Out of respect for the dead,
Out of respect for theâ¦ dead

The night is calm and quiet now, my grunts the only sound,
the moon is my companion shedding light upon the pale
once again
