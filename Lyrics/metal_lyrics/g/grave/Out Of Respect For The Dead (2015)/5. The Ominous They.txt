Disrupted in my peaceful sleep
by sounds familiar again,
dormant spirits in this creaking house
come again for pleasure and pain

Cold,
afraid,
dark,
restless souls disrupting my sleep

"They" claim the house as theirs
and come alive at dusk,
lost among the dead,
revealing the horrors of afterlife

Cold, still decaying "They" roam the night,
afraid of changes, disrupting their world,
dark in mind and dark in heart,
restless souls demanding to return again

The ominous "They",
lost and ridden with grief,
returning to obtain serenity

Cold, still decaying "They" roam the night,
afraid of changes, disrupting their world,
dark in mind and dark in heart,
restless souls demanding to return again

Lurking in the shadows, awaiting the night to come,
reliving life in an endless vortex of pain and suffering,
trapped between the worlds of the living and the dead,
"They" cry out in frustration remembering past lives
