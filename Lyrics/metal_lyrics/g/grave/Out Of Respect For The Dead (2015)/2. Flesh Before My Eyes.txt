Never felt a part of this gruesome world,
on the edge of what they accept,
feeling so hateful and lost within,
born in sin, heart of stone

Heart of stone

Rebel since the early days and always derailed,
born and bred into the lords command,
never trusting anyone but myself,
cast the stone, break the seal

Common sense declares,
they must die,
overflowing life,
purposeless, benign

Murder in my blood,
a sweet arousing sight,
Flesh before my eyes,
forever my destiny

Torture in the air,
stained by rot they rest,
as I walk among the pain,
my purpose now complete

Murder in my blood,
a sweet arousing sight,
Flesh before my eyes,
forever my destiny
