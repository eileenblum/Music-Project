Starved through years of worship and sin,
my dark side of life,
as my hunger grows my faith declines,
lust for flesh stronger than God

Perished through years of divinity,
love to you is hate for me

Raised to obey their fairytales unquestionably,
ridden with fear and whipped with words about sinners' fate,
as my true self emerges violently,
lust for God through blasphemy

Blessed by the words of the fellow flock
"Praise the newborn son!"
but my faith is stronger than flesh and blood,
death to you means life for me

Reveling in sin amongst a pile of dead,
piled against their idol on his cross of shame

Darkness growing closer,
my fear is gone as death arrives,
hatred growing stronger,
my dreams are real,
now forever I shall burn

Piled against their idol on his cross of shame
