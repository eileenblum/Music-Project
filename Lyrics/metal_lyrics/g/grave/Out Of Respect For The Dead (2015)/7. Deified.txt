Stranger in a strange world, forgotten and alone,
imagining a higher truth with me as the divine,
searching high and low for the weak of mind
to build my empire and revel in my law of dirt

Scheming and illusive, my way of life,
gathering my followers of truth,
promising eternal life for those who obey,
every twisted sick compulsive stray

I tether them to silence and lash them into shape
molding their minds to suit my paradise,
I'm in charge, they follow every wish and word,
reversed psychology has now put me on their throne

I'm glorified, deified,
turned myself into God in their eyes

I tether them to silence and lash them into shape
molding their minds to suit my paradise

Come and share my dreams,
come and share my sins,
live through my revelations,
my way is yours for life

Scheming and illusive, my way of life,
gathering my followers of truth,
promising eternal life for those who obey,
every twisted sick compulsive stray

Come and share my dreams,
come and share my sins,
live through my revelations,
my way is yours for life
