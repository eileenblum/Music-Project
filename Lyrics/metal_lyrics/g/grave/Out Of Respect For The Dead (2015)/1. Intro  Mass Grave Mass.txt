Waking up in silence in a trench of rot,
completely buried by the dead,
their screams are silent now, the mission complete,
to forever be forgotten in this hole of hate

The stench of my friends and family,
as a morbid reminder, all over me

Starting my ascent through the pile of twisted flesh,
I can't believe I'm still alive,
my intended grave looks so peaceful from above,
another unknown pit in the forest of genocide

Left alive,
left alone,
I say farewell
as the spirits call my name

Gathered just like sheep
for the cleansing of humanity,
marched into the night,
paraded to the sound of rapid fire

Through the helpless screaming
I heard them dropping one by one,
absence of their trusted God
as the dawn breaks the forest weeps

Waking up in silence in a trench of rot,
completely buried by the dead,
their screams are silent now, the mission complete,
to forever be forgotten in this hole of hate

Left alive,
left to rot
so I say farewell
as the spirits call my name
