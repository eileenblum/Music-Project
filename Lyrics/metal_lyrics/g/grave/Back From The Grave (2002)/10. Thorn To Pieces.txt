Seeking the answers to my state of mind
Can I go on with the demons inside?
Trying to rid of these thoughts
The urge to kill for pleasure is so strong

So I do it again
Nothing else seems to mind

Blood on my hands and blood on my mind
That's the way that I spend my days
The war that rages inside of me
Is always won by the dark half of me

So I do it again
Cause they told me again

Never will I spare your feeble life
On your knees they will find you
Thorn to pieces
Never will I shed a tear for you
Or the ones yet to come

War against those who cross my path
War against those who deny the dark
Blood on my hands and blood on my mind
As I hunt down the next one in line

Never will I spare your feeble life
On your knees they will find you
Thorn to pieces
Never will I shed a tear for you
Or the ones yet to come
