No way out of here
Trapped in a vacuum between the living and the dead
I hear them call me from the other side
Disbelieve I have been my whole life

Guide my soul to rest

Who will decide my faith
Some say the body will decompose and turn to dust
Spirits appear in front of me
Reaching for my mind to decide

And I choose to be...

...Bloodfed - not misled
Not sacred - or Godled

You drink the blood of Christ
I drink the blood of you
I would not have it any other way

Back with the dead again
Since my first visit it has now come clear
Rather that spend my afterlife among the praying
I'd rather be...

...Bloodfed - not misled
Not sacred - or Godled
