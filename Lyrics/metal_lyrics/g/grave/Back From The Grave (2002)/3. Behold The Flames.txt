Dawn of creation for the second time
Sin or salvation which one will it be?

Meet the one who they call the fallen one
Rules reserved now as evil is in command

Sin or salvation?
Feel no sympathy
For the ones left behind
Their times is soon to come

Ignore the one who they call their saviour
Rule reversal under my command

As the night falls
Take your first breath
Behold the flames
As the world burns

Wasn't it worth it to die?
Better on the dark side
No preachers and masses and lies
Never more look to the sky

As the night falls
Take your first breath
Behold the flames
As the world burns

Now that you've seen our side
Can you return to the lie?
Wasn't it worth it to fry?
Rid all the troubles of fire

But they told you Jesus is still alive
Angel choirs versus angels' cries
Should not be a problem to decide
Are you in or out?
