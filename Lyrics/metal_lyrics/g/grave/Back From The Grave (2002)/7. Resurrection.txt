I thought that you would appreciate me
Just tried to keep you for eternity
First time failure is seems to me
The thought was not to make you bleed

Seemed like a good plan to prolong your life
Covered with chemicals since your last breath
I've been trying to preserve you
To bring you back into my life

Dreams of eternity
Turned you into morbidity
I can not undo this pain
That I've caused you

Flesh begins to rot and peel away
Resurrection of your body has failed
As you feel your life drain away
The sound of death is ringing in your head

All my dreams are shattered
How shall I proceed?

I thought that you would appreciate me
Covered with chemicals since your last breath
I've been trying to preserve you
The thought was not to make you bleed

Flesh begins to rot and peel away
Resurrection of your body has failed
As you feel your life drain away
The sound of death is ringing in your head
