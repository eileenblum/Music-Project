From the darkest depths of hell
Spawn of evil is set free

Domination since the dawn of time
Soulhunter will prevail again

The only angels you'll ever see
Will be the dark ones - Below

Trying to please the holy one
See what that has brought you to
Live by the book, live by the lies
The purest souls is what we crave

Step into the flames
You are our guest for eternity

No use to look to the skies
Clench your hands one last time

Domination for eternity
Soulhunter has prevailed again
