I am reborn I have seen the light
I was lost but now I'm found
Judgement Day is soon to come
Sinners beware and bow down

I see them in the streets
Speaking to no one

Weak in their mind and weak in their hearts
So convincing to themself
I've seen the truth, Dead is better
Than living in a self-created dream

Let me guide you down
Path #666

Through the portals of damnation
Prepare to taste the virgin's blood
Darkness surrounds you as we part
Your body from your soul

I have seen the truth, Dead is better
Than to live in a state of dreams

Now you're reborn but now by the light
Tormented screams is now your mass
Now admit taht our salvation
Has more to offer that Paradise

Through the portals of damnation
Prepare to taste the virgin's blood
Darkness surrounds you as we part
Your body from your soul

"Hell is only a word...
Reality is much, much worse"
