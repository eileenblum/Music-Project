Damn the ones who put me here
Four white walls to save my soul
I will not deny what I have done
But to me it is normal not a crime

Stripping flesh from the bone
Tearing limb from limb
Eyes that no longer see
Is a feast for me

So I suffer quietly
Let them try to figure my inside out
Maybe I should give them a taste
Human flesh converts the most doubtful mind

Stripping flesh from the bone
Tearing limb from limb
These are things that I do
To feel satisfied

No more tears falling from my eyes
No regrets, no repent
I decide who will live or die
In my world, I am god

Now they can't hurt me no more
Since my body is just an empty shell
I have left in search for
Another body to inhabit for a while

No more tears falling from my eyes
No regrets, no repent
I decide who will live or die
In my world, I am god
