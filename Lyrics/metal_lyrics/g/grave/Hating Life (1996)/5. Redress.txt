Put me down I'll set you up
You're just like the others
Damn you for being so superior
I couldn't careless if you were found burnt
On your kness and beg
And I might just spare that fancy head
On second thought you're not worth the cleaning of my tools afterwards
Done my deeds
More grets
Your high horses rode a way and made my day
Tearing my sanity
Was this right this done deed
As I gaze at you now nothing speaks against me
You put me down
I set you up
Guess you were like the others
Let's see now if someone cares
When they found you burnt
