For decades I have waited for your response
Cause deep inside I felt that we had bonded long ago
Now a lifetime has passed before my eyes
But I've seen nothing but your face behind the veil of that snow white dress
We were ment to be for eternity
Spent your twenties between the sheets with everyone exept me
What was left for me
Couldn't eat sleep couldn't be
Call it insanity
My blushing bride I'm back
I lived this life for so long
Unknowing or not you should have seen you're top of priority for me
Now a lifetime has passed before my eyes
But I have still seen nothing but your face behind the veil of that snow white dress
We were ment to be for eternity
Spent my twenties in solitary
Now our time has come
On your knees
Ready or no there I come
All over you my pale white bride
Now I'm free
With you lying here next to me
You are cold all over now
Not just your heart
What was left for me
Couldn't eat sleep couldn't be
Call it insanity
My blushing bride I'm back
My blushing bride goodbye
