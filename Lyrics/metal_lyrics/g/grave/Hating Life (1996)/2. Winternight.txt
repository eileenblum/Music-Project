Looking in to your eyes
What do I see
My lost love staring back at me
I love you with all of my heart 'til death do us apart
You left me winternight
What's left for me
What's left for me
What's left for you
We were ment to get her for eternity
And live our life's in sweet harmony
But life's shit and so are you
Winternight
What's left for you
But life's shit and so are you
Winternight
What's left for me
I love with all of my heart 'til death do us apart
Winternight
What's left for you
What's left for me
What's left for you
What's left for me
What's left for you
