Words spoken
Grim but true
To be never forgotten they were carved in you
Carved in you
Worshiped since the ancient walked our world
Used as trust when you are lost on another harvest day
Harvest day
I hear their voices but dear not listen
Words spoken
The same a sacrved in you used as trust when you got lost
on another harvest day
Harvest day
I hear their voices but dear not listen
