Searching for the entrance to this maze they call life
Running around in circles of this lifes big wheel
Never thought that it was true what they said I guess
I'll have to learn the hard way
Like a freak in a show
Beaten and scorned
Locked a way and kept restrained
Like a freak in a show
Beaten and scorned
Locked a way and kept restrained
Imprisoned for no crime
I'll be here 'til the end of time
Vengence will be mine if these straps would loose nup
Pay back time for all of you who've helped me to get well
Like a freak in a show
Beaten and scorned
Locked a way and kept restrained
Like a freak in a show
Beaten and scorned
Locked a way and kept restrained
Imprisoned for no crime
I'll be here 'til the end of time
