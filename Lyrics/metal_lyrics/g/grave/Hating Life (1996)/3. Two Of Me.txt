Would you like to come in
This is sacred place for my sin
Have a taste of my goods
And if you please me I'll be good
There will never be tweo of me
But deep inside
I know one is more than enough
It is over now
All the lies
You must see this with your own eyes
I am god
You are waste
But deep inside these walls were the same
There will never be two of me
Deep inside I know one is more than enough
So have you seen enough or shall
I do some more works of art
To convince you that this is right
To join me in some clean sing of my reich
