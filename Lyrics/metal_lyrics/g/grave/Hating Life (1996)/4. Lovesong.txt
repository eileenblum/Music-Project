You were everything for me
With eyes blue as the sea
You're an angel in human disguise
I gave you all of my love
And if I would die now
You have sealed my destiny
I'll drown in your deep blue eyes
You gave me all your lave
What happened between us
I long for what we had and what shoul be
And if I would die now
I have sealed your destiny
I'll drown in your deep blue eyes
To live without you makes life so painful
You were everything to me
And will always be
