Buried beneath the rain from this clouded sky
I can't breathe but still emotions flow through me
Like I never left your side
I can hear you cry from my final place of rest
Sorrowfilled moon shines through my six feet roof
I long for you to bring me back
Silently I'm cursing all beliefs
Wondering if you dream of me
Like I never left your side
I can hear you cry from my final place of rest
If you love me you should join me
Share this void I min
If you love me you'll make sure well stay together
Buried beneath the rain from this clouded sky
I can't breathe but still emotions flow through me
Like I never left your side
I can hear you cry from my final place of rest
Sorrowfilled moon shines through me six feet roof
I long for you to bring me back
