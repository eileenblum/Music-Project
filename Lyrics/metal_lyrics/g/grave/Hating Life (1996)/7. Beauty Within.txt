Liar save me your speach
Liar save me your speach
You are perfect for me
There is no excuse for your repulsiveness
They say its all in my head
That I must realize it's a figure of speach
But I'm curious to find out myself
Beauty comes from within
Let's see if that is true
Too late for regrets
Now that you're open wide
Why punish punish me
Guess that I was wrong
That was no pretty sight
But I'll try again until I find mrs. right
Thay say its all in my head
That I must realize it's a figure of speach
But I'm curious to find out myself
Beauty comes from within
Now I know that is so
This little unborn life is truly adorable
Why punish me I had to know
What is right
What is wrong
This proof I found
It say it all
