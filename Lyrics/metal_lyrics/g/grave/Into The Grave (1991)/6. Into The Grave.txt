Enter the gates, gates to madness
You feel that the end is near
you know that your end is hear
Shadows from hell reflect in your mind
into the darkside you go for eternal rest

Winds of death are blowing cold
annihilated earth is what it leaves behind
Funeral in the night, open grave
Your coffin stands open, your face is pale,
servants of the dark are taking you into the dark soil
You descend your soul

into the darkness, into the grave
Your life on earth belongs to the past,
into eternal death, your faith has died,
into the darkness, into the grave.

Face the death, look him in the eye,
you can't turn back once you've come this far.
Pray for your life to a non-existing god,
realize that it's over.

Into the darkness, into the grave
Your life on earth belongs to the past
into eternal death, your faith has died
Into the darkness, into the grave
