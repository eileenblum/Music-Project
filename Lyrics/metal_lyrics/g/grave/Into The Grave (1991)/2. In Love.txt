You lie so nice in front of me
As I brought you from your grave
You lost some skin and a lot of weight
But still you look sexy in your new shape

People blame me for being insane
But I am just in love
Why doesn't anybody understand
That sickness is my command

Every morning I think you are there
I ca still feel the warmth from your body
I've missed you for far too long
That's why I bring you back where you belong

People blame me for being insane
But I am just in love
Why doesn't anybody understand
That sickness is my command

I have thoughts of commit suicide
So I can be where you are now
Where you are I want to be
That's why I bring you back to me

When we get home, I'll split your legs
On this dark day of desecration

I love you as much now as back then
When you were alive and loving wife
After this I'll try again
To pull the trigger and make my day

People blame me for being insane
But I am just IN LOVE
Why doesn't anybody understand
That sickness is my command
