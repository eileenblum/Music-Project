As you're lying for your death
and wait for the sign, to walk through
The portholes to achieve eternal life

Soon to change your life to face the
truth that life after death is a lie
Hating life, your faith has died

Now when your end is near
you enter the dark
you feel the pain and want to die
So where is your light
and life after death
It's into the grave
eternal rest

Where is your light?
Where is your god?
Where is your eternal life?
Ashes to ashes
dust to dust
into the dark
into the realm of death

Hating life, your faith has died
