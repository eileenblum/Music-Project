A life in terror in a landscape cursed by hate
Where people fear each other and seal each other's fate
The most self-destructive creature has been created
Slaying its victims and the world to them related

In fear they are banished to live
In pain they are destined to die

Afraid
From whom who will take their lives

Sent to the final confrontation
It's time for pain to set in
As the creature believes in resurrection
It's time for them to smell the coffin
As they once are lost and into the sickness they fall
There's no way they will see the light
when death makes his call

In fear they are banished to live
In pain they are destined to die

Afraid
From whom who will take their lives

For reasons so fucked up,
you destroy what you built up
The end has come and their belief
will turn to pain and be their grief
There is no escape from this world of hate
As time passes by you know it's too late
Trapped within your fear screaming out your pain
It's time for you to die, never awake again

A life in terror in a landscape cursed by hate
Where people fear each other and seal each other's fate
The most self-destructive creature has been created
Slaying its victims and the world to them related

In fear they are banished to live
In pain they are destined to die

Afraid
From whom who will take their lives
