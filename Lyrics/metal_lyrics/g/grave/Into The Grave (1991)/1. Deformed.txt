Wired by the smell of death
As your end is drawing near

He make yo cry he make you bleed
But you feel no fucking fear

God won't wake you from your sleep

Banished from life
the stinking air
Drastic suffering,
you are deformed

DEFORMED

Your screams fill the stinking air
Painful death is waiting you

God won't wake you from your sleep

Banished from life
the stinking air
Drastic suffering,
you are deformed

Revolting face
putrid remains
One eye left,
bloody hands

Banished from life
the stinking air
Drastic suffering,
you are deformed
