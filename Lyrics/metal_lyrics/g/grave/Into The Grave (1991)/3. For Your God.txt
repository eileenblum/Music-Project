Holy Mary is crying blood
As you are dying for your God
Sacrifice in the church of sin
Blood pours still, demon's win
Victim in the claws of evil
Bodies split in front of his eyes
Pray to god one more time
Before you hear the bells chime

You searched for salvation, but entered damnation
Trapped by the claws of death, you die for your god

Gates of pearl, place of sin
Priests will die when the ritual begins
Feel the heat, taste the smoke
You pray to god as you choke

You searched for salvation, but entered damnation
Trapped by the claws of death, you die for your god

You were born thorugh me and you shall die for me
You shall destroy the son of the holy
When I later call for you, you shall be slayed on the altar
As a sacrifice so I can exist and rule the world with evil

Holy Mary is crying blood
As you are dying for your God
Sacrifice in the church of sin
Blood pours still, demon's win
Victim in the claws of evil
Bodies split in front of his eyes
Pray to god one more time
Before you hear the bells chime

You searched for salvation, but entered damnation
Trapped by the claws of death, you die for your god
