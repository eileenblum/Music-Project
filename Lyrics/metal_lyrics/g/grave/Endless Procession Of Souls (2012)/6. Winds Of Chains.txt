Trashing storms arise
Leering beneath your feet
Ripping winds and ice
Tornado upon the horizon of doom

Human desolation draws near
Just as meine prophet foreseen
The sound of steel shatters through the night
Carving through your brain and soul

The Winds of Chains

The day of days has come
Chaos roams the streets
Burning, looting, raping, shooting
Bad news for everyone in sight

The Winds of Chains

Inhuman condition
Natures rebellion
Trashing storms arise
Leering beneath your feet
Ripping winds and ice
Tornado upon the horizon of doom

The day of days has come
Chaos roams the streets
Burning, looting, raping, shooting
Everyone in sight
