Born into strict policy
To serve and worship his name
Forged in Christianity
To never understand free will

Locked inside you struggle to understand
Is this my destiny?
Seeing daily life with the parish eyes
To please and praise his word

Passion of the Weak
Imprisoned mind, beaten and scorned
Passion and holy seed
Breeding the cult for the end of days

Sunday mass to sing his praise
Or face his wrath
Let the children come to me
Sublime supremacy, sickening beliefs

Locked inside you struggle to praise his word
Is this my destiny?
Living daily life with the parish lies
Dawn of rebirth, come to me

Passion of the Weak
Imprisoned mind, beaten and scorned
Passion and holy seed
Breeding the cult for the end of days

Locked inside you struggle to understand
To please and praise his word
