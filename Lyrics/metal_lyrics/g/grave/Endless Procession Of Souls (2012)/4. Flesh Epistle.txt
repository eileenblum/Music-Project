Lashing through the night
Seeking lust through flesh
In my darkest memories I feast
For the price of sanity I trade humanity
Disregarding your beliefs
Save me

Sick of life I roam the streets
To cleanse them all
I was never meant for this life
Echoes of flesh in my head, insanity?
To repent I fill my veins
With your dead rotting blood

Flesh Epistle

Ripping your dreams apart
My craving for your flesh in overload
Sinful quest of the damned

Flesh Epistle
