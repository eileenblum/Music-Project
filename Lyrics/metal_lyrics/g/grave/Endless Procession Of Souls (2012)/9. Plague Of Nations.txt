Terror is rising in the East
Never endish suicide
Holy war put you to death
Bombing, killing, murder
Brainwashed from birth
Medieval ways practiced today

Ready to die for your God
Martyr death gives you praise
Oppressive laws, living like slaves

Raging death, on they slay
Spreading terror, the end of the world
Genital mutilation, veil of oppression
Bombing, killing, murder
Ravaging madmen born to die
Holy war unjustified

Ready to die for your God
Martyr death gives you praise
Oppressive laws, living like slaves

Descending darkness, evil has landed
Force fed with your God, a lunatic herd

Innocent victims perish in the flames
Holy war is upon us now

Ready to die for your God
Oppressive laws feeds your hate
