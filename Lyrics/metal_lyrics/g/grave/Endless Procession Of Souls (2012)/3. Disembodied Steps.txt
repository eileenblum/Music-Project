Ghastly sounds follow me through the night
Like a trail from the shadowland, the spirits roam free
Seeking contact in the dusk, taunting my sleep
Remnants of life carried through death
In the world beyond my dreams

Leave me be
I deny your being

Disembodied steps, echoes through the night
Like a reoccurring dream they visit me
Restless souls trapped with me
Seeking comfort and eternity

Oneway conversation with my walls
I record their moaning all around me
Figure in black sweeps across the room
Refusing my presence, redeeming my conscience

Leave me be
I deny your being

Disembodied steps, echoes through the night
Like a reoccurring dream they visit me
Restless souls trapped with me
Seeking comfort and eternity

Driven to the breaking point
Is it just my loneliness fuckin' with my mind?
Centuries of hate trapped inside these walls
Living death claiming their rights
