Born in the winter plague
To command the blindly led
Sworn to authority by the weakened flock
In search of meaning and faith

Bring forth the child of light
Show me the wonders of your Christ
Incestuous sodomy, spawn of your dreams
Beyond your sanity my throne of thorns await

Lord of the blind and weak
To uphold divinity
Lead me astray
Far from reality, take me away

In the name of the dead, sick, lost, son
I deny your king
In the name of my own free mind

Born in the winter plague
To command the blindly led
Lead me astray
Far from reality, take me away

Bring forth the child of light
Show me the wonders of your Christ
Incestuous sodomy, spawn of your dreams
Beyond your sanity my throne of thorns await
