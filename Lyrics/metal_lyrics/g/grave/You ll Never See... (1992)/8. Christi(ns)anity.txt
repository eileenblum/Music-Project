Living in a constant dream of a place you've never seen
Preaching all those feeble lies of a life in paradise
Your faith is just insanity too scared to face reality
Stupid enough to believe all this christinsanity

You make me sick
Feeble son

I'll laugh at you when you die because you won't get a better life
Dreaming of your paradise can't you see it's only lies
Your end is coming closer now another day you'll never see
Blind you are and dead you'll be your faith is just christinsanity

You make me laugh
Chosen one

I laugh right upon your face I laugh at your religious faith
I laugh at you when you cry I laugh at the crucified
Living in a constant dream of a place you'll never see
Preaching all those feeble lies of a life in paradise
Your end is coming closer now another day you'll never see
