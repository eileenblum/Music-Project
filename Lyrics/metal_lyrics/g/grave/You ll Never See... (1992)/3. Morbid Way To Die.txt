You are captured in a forgotten world
Where blood is fire and death is god
You feel lonely but you're not
Surrounded by mutants you will rot

The end is near you are going insane
You are still alive slowly rotting inside

It's a morbid way to die

Your life fades away as you wish for death
You beg for help to take your last breath
The plague has arrived you will turn to dust
Putrefacted body rotten inside

The end is near you are going insane
You are still alive slowly rotting inside

It's a morbid way to die

Brought to die among the gods
Your flesh is dust in your dreams you are lost

Morbid way to die
Morbid way to die
