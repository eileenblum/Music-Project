All alone in darkness
A vision passed his eyes
Of a better life in heaven
Of a life in paradise

To hear the screams of tormented pain
As dying victims feed the flames

Looked back at life found himself betrayed
Betrayed by god and his way (of life)
Lived his life to those lies
Betrayed by the light for which he died

His body now sets its final course
He is nothing but another corpse
There was no heaven but there was hell
In the fire he will forever dwell

Awaiting for the angels
To come and set him free
To take him to heaven
The place he longs to be
To hear the screams of tormented pain
As dying victims feed the flames
A big black shape invocates him
To open portals for him to see

He was obsessed
Obsessed by paradise
Was it worth to die
For a god and his lies?
