You will never see ...heaven

Take my hand and walk with me until the end
You will never see heaven

Come and walk with me my friend
I will guide you to the end
Into the grateful pit
Into the ever black
Where there is no return
You will forever rest

You will never see heaven

I'm the one to set you free
I release you from this life you live
I seal your destiny
And you will writhe in pain
As I make you one
With eternity

Take my hand and walk with me until the end
You will never see heaven
Joh. 3:16 + Mark 15:34
Burst of laughter when you die
Your belief won't save you now
In your pit you lie naked
Forever dead and mutilated

Come and walk with me my friend
I will guide you to the end
Into the grateful pit
And you will writhe in pain
As I make you one
With eternity

Take my hand and walk with me until the end
You will never see heaven
