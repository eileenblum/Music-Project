Oh my saviour set me free release me from my agony
Grant me your eternal reich take me to where corpses lie

Look into my dying eyes still gazing with ecstasy
Take me away end my life end my misery

I feel the urge to leave this earth
End my grief give me my relief

Make me one with the soil give me eternal peace
Let me never see more end my fuckin' grief
I don't want to see the light I want to die on this night
I wanna feel eternal pain I wanna feel the burning flames

Let me die in pain let me see the flames
Take my life away sacrifice me

Oh my saviour set me free release me from my agony
Grant me your eternal reich take me to where corpses lie

I feel the urge to leave this earth
End my grief give me my relief
