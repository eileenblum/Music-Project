A world in darkness
Where the insane lead the blind
Embrace a history written in blood
Depraved and corrupt

Quench our blood thirst
With the prophets tears

Scourge of Prometheus
Incinerate the sickness from this earth
From ashes to blown away dust
Charred corpses on display

Wash away the filth
The stench of rot and decay

Remains of the fallen
Bleeding from the skies above
All is silent
Waiting for a final breath
A lonely angel crying
Standing at the brink of death
Wings clipped by flames
Blackened with despair

Beneath the shifting sands
In ruin cities of the damned
Souls of the past
Guard the wicked ways

Erase the unworthy with nuclear fire
Burn their cities to dust
Turn deserts into glass
We rather reign in hell than serve in heaven

Quench our blood thirst
With the prophets tears

Remains of the fallen
Bleeding from the skies above
All is silent
Waiting for a final breath
A lonely angel crying
Standing at the brink of death
Wings clipped by flames
Blackened with despair
