In Eternal Battle
The Quest of After Life
In infinity
Raving Mad or firm convinced
Sets the tone in life
Forces gathered on both sides
Claim the final price

At the end of days
Deathstorm

Slay in trust of promised wealth
"Heaven Will Receive"
Soldier In the name of God
Marching on
Justified by church and state
never questioned or surveyed
Insane... Restrained...
By the Ties of Christ

At the end of days
Deathstorm
As the weak pray
Deathstorm

Madness in the house of God
Stains humanity
Repent! Believe!
