Struggling through this wasteland of lost time
When will I ever rest
Forced by darkness, forced by fear
Forever bloodcaressed

What have I become?
Feeder of lies, stained by hate

Storm inside my vessel of lost souls
Their moans awaken me
Urge for darkness, urge for blood
Never Christ caressed

What have I become?
Feeder of lies, stained by hate

For the price of sanity, I will bleed you dry
For your christinsanity, and your lies

Darkened my mind
Empty my eyes
As I lay my soul to rest
You will burn!

Storm inside my wasteland of lost time
I will forever reign
Saved by darkness, saved by lust
Forever stained by hate

For the price of sanity, I will bleed you dry
For your christinsanity, and your lies
