The seal of god is broken
Broken to shreds
Faith in ruins, obsolete
Redemption, extinction

Raging hate
Rape the cross
Death to you is life to me
Fallen angel son

Take my hand, sinner and saint
Feed my damnation
Faith in ruins, obsolete
Stigmatized, paralyzed

Raging hate
Turn the cross
Death to you is life to me
Fallen angel son

Fallen from above in a shroud of light
Demons awoken by the thirst for blood

The gates of hell are open
Welcome home
Skin crawls from the heat
Transform to perfection

Raging hate
Burn the cross
Death to you is life to me
Fallen angel son

Mist of blood
Turns to dust
Welcome home
Fallen angel son
