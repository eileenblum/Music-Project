Lying under the falling rain
The urge crows in me
The sweetest taste deepest red
Caress my lips as I embrace the dead
As I suck blood

Look into my vicious eyes
Tell me if I am wicked
The necrolust grows inside
Inside my sick head

I know you rest under that flower bed
And I am going down

On a bed of roses under a clouded sky
I cover you with kissess your blood makes me high
They say you're dead so I should leave you alone
I'm so in love that I son't care
On a bed of roses under the falling rain
I rape your corpse again and again and again

Wander beneath the clouded sky
I think it's time to say goodbye
To say goodbye to my wicked world
To join the sleep of my eternal love

I go under my gun, take farewell to the sun
It's time to be as one
