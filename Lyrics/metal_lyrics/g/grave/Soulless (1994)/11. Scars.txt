Scars from a shattered life
Sunk into an emotional abyss
Memories of blood
Multiple voices inside of me
Dismembered personality
I'm lost in my sick head

I am paranoid (will I ever be the same)
Lost in void (will I forever be insane)

Shadowed, clouded are my eyes
Buried in my disordered mind
My freedom will come when I die
Demons inside of me
Ripping the hour of need

I am paranoid...

The dark half of me a side I cannot see

Scars...
I am...
The dark...
