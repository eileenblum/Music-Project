I'll take you into the ever black
I conquer your weak soul
Flood of pain falls like rain
As I grant your eyes my evil desire

Tears you feel are tears that bleed
I rape you slow infernally

Come inside of me hear the symphony
Of the crying souls

I'll take into the ver black
Your bleeding soul I caress
Undressed from skin you cry within
On your virgin flesh I sin

Tears you fee...
Come inside of me...

Tears - unknown to me
Fear - unknown to me
