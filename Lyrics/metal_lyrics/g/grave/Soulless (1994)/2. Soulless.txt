In my dominion I control the weak
And in vain in pain they turn the other cheek
I'm souless

In my dominion I tear their soul apart
Pure eternal hate run through my soulless heart

I'm soulless to the core I'm 666
I am your death I am the crucifix
On which you are nailed

Their pain makes me strong
I breathe from their fear
I am the one man call wrong
I laugh at their tears
I live where angels cry
I make them suffer my sin
Screams released in agony
As I undress them from skin

In my dominion blood will always reign
I damn your soul to everlasting pain
I'm soulless

I'm soulless to the core...
I am your death...
