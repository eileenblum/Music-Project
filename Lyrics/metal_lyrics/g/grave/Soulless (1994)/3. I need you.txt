In the name of the father
In the name of the son
In the name of the holy ghost

Is that why you killed me
Well at least you tried
Tried to put me to rest
But I survived

I am your soul I am your master
You are my tool to bring disaster
You know I love you but that's a lie
I only need you to survive

Pray to your god, you pray as you spit red
Pray to your god, you god will fail and you
Will be dead...

Try to ignore me but that won't do
I won't leave before I've killed you
In the name of the father...
Your god is dead and I am the one

Pray to...
