Another body emptied from soul
Engulfed by my infernal breath
Bloodlust over me I'm losing control
Condemned to suffer you'll rest
As you follow me into infinity

The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed - godshed

My soul has turned to black
Nothing exist now but pain
I shall now return
Dead I will remain
And you'll follow me into my lechery

The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed - godshed
I must be bloodfed - bloodborn

Another body bleeds from it's soul
Victim for my infernal need
I'm in control your blood in me
Condemned to suffer my insanity
And you shall lead me into obscurity

The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed - godshed
I want to see you dead
