Welcome to sinland
The paradise of the damned
You give me pleasure I give you pain
When I am done you'll never see again

There is no turning black
I'm turning black

Lost is our glorious world
Sin we explore
We enjoy your pain
And through your pain we will be reborn

To fulfill my endless desire
I enter the land of fire
To create my infernal breed
It's your blood I need

Your life is under siege
I slay you I damn the weak

To fulfill my endless desire
I throw myself into the fire

Welcome...

There is no...
I am the black...
