Close your eyes fall into the arms of Morpheus
Come below with me into my kingdom you
Will fall

Fall from your dream in a blood stream
Fall from life into my paradisal genocide

Visualize the darkest world of morbidity
My paradise, a realm of lust and perversion

Close your eyes sleep forever
Close your mind. Explore
With the angels
Crying, weepng, dying
As we go to war, against your soul

Blood strained is your soul as it is lost
To my sinful lust
And bleeding you shall die so close your
Eyes and fall

Fall from...
