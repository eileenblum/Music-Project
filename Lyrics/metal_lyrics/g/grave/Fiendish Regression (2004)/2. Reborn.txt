Empty eyes following your steps
Solely assigned to taste your Flesh
Far beyond any hesitation
Soon you will meet the Undead

And he stands before you in all his pride
Once a human, brought Immortal life
For the price of eartlhy being
He was blessed with Killing spree

The Blood before your eyes clouds your perception
Is this for real or just a dream?
As you feel the claws Ripping through your bone
One word echoes inside your head

Blood

Blood For Master
Blood For My Soul

Now that I have joined the Undead
I've learned the Pleasures of the Flesh
For the price of earthly being
I roam the night Immortalized

Now I stand before you in all my pride
Once a human brought Immortal life
And to bring you into our world
I command the draining of your Blood

Blood For Master
Blood For My Soul
