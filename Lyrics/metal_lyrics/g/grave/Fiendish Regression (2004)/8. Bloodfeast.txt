Bloodfeast
Your body on the altar like so many before you
Stripped down against your will to Satisfy my Sickening Lust

Scream on my temporary guest
No one will hear you in my Descecrating hour

Trying to live without this Ghastly passion
But to me it's not a deviation

Burial
I clean your Bones before the remains are concealed
Far below I hide away the parts I no longer need

No more Screams from my temporary guest
Her head is on my shelf

Trying to live without this Ghastly passion
But to me it's not a deviation

Ever since my early days I have felt this way
Far from normal yet the only way
To feed the Urge inside for fresh human Flesh
So stop the judging, this is my reality

Bloodstreams
Running down the altar, I gaze on it in a trance
Longing for another friend to Satisfy my Sickening Lust

Deep inside I know that I will Kill
Again and again and again and again

Trying to live without this Ghastly passion
But to me it's not a deviation
