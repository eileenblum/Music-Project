Trapped inside this mortal body
My wish is his command unknowingly
Forever it seems since I was free
My urge is growing stronger
I want to Slay them myself

Just like it used to be

Placed on earth to satisfy the need
To breed the bodies for Dark supremacy
Once I also was one of those
Whom I now seek to bring back with me

Come with me, come Die with me
I offer you Eternity

Mission accomplished one more sent down
So I search for another host
You who are descents of holy seed
Will always be the only target for me

Come with me, come Die with me
I offer you Eternity
