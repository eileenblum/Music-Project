My secret friends inside tells me my daily plans
This far they've never failed me
My one and only choice in life
Has been to follow their commands
I never question them, So why should you?
My sole existence is to Kill

Insanity for you may be my daily deeds
Alone with my blade seems so surreal

Say, can you hear them?
They whisper to me "Judgement day has come"
Don't incarcerate me
It may seem strange to you but it's my reality

My secret friends inside tells me my daily plans
I never question them, So why should you?

Say, can you hear them?
They whisper to me "Slay for us tonight"
Please get them off me
This is my honest truth, my blade doesn't lie
