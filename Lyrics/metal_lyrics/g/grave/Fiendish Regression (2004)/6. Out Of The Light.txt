Hatred stronger than ever
Since you turned your back at me
How can I put my trust
In someone false like you

Blinded by the tales, I chose my path
No more lustful living, I changed my ways
And before I knew it, I was enslaved
Under the sign of christ, I fell from grace

Not a sign of proof, only the words
Spoken from the preachers, the selfelected
Seeing sin in everything to gain their grip
I must find a way to get me out of the light

You don't need to save me
I'll save myself
Don't try to pursuade me
My life is Mine

Hatred became my fate
Under the sign of christ I fell from grace

Blinded by the tales
I must find a way to get me out of the light

You don't need to save me
I'll save myself
Don't try to pursuade me
My life is Mine
