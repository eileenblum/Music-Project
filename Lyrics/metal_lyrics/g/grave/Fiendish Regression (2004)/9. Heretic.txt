Weighing good against Evil
Weighing light against the Dark
Ask yourself what seems reasonably
The choice for you and me should not be hard to make

Fanatics bred through fabrications
Based purely on Lies
Mislead, astray, following the herd
Weak minded with no selfesteem

So, just leave me be
My Heresy is rooted deep inside my Black heart
Leave me be
My Heresy is rooted deep inside

Some turn towards a stone, others clinch their hands
Some fall on their knees in choral speech
Take a look around you in the world of today
How can you seriously believe in gods existency

So, just leave me be
My Heresy is rooted deep inside my Black heart
Leave me be
My Heresy is rooted deep inside
