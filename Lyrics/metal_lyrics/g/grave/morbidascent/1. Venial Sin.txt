I fornicate and revel in lust
Still forever in the grace of god
Repenting my petty crimes
I pay by praise and start again

Confide in me, my child
I'll wipe your conscience clean
It's just another venial sin

Sin by sin, I cannot fail
My holy church defends me
Repeating my petty crimes
My reason and my trust divine

Confide in me, my child
I'll wipe your tears away
It's just another venial sin

Confide in me, my friend
I will wipe your conscience clean
Your robe is as red as the blood on your hands
Yet clean as the virgin white

The children seem so pretty
Through the eyes of our lord
Sin, my son, sin!
I will make you pure once again

I fornicate and revel in lust
Forever in the grace of god
Repenting my petty crimes
I pay by praise and start again

Sin by sin, I cannot fail
My holy church defends me
Repeating my petty crimes
My reason and my trust divine
