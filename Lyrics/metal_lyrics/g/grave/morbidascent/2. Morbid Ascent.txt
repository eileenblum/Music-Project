Crawling through the fields of human flesh and decay
This forgotten tomb has been my home
Reaching for the skies above to grasp my release
To rise again and to find my peace

Silent souls in the dusk, entombed and confined
On the darkened mountain side they lie
A stray of lights upon the skull guides my path
From the underworld I shall rise

Morbid since birth
Beneath your scorched earth
Awaiting my arrival, to the fallen world
To triumph and reign

Crooked horns crown my head
Disciple with a cause, unearthed for so long
Demonic grin I bear and my fathers eyes
Face of death upon my skin

Morbid since birth
Beneath your scorched earth
Awaiting my arrival, to the fallen world
To triumph and reign through pain

Silent souls in the dusk, entombed and confined
On the darkened mountain side they lie
Reaching for the skies above to grasp my release
From the underworld I shall rise

Remnants of death carried through life
Finally ascending through fire
Announcing my arrival with a blackened sun
In your fallen world I triumph and reign
In the shadows
