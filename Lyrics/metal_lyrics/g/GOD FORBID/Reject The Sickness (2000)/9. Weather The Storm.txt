Meaningless morals of class unlike you
A struggle of embrace words which ring untrue

Weather the storm
Go your own way
Weather the storm
Go your own way

For freedom against the lies told to you
Events yet to come

Sanitized anger of parallel journeys drive to
Chaotic change unjustly accused of constant abuse
At the hands of others bent on control
Returning home through the unseen eye of a child
Not knowing right from wrong

Regurgitation of old becoming new,
Corrupting bowels of society values
Plague for domination
Lower class bent on redemption

Weather the storm
Go your own way
