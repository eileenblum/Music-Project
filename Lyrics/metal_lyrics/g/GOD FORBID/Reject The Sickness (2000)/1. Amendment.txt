NO MORE

Retribution, handed down to you
Generation, to generation
Guilty by association

We are laid to rest
No more of the lies
Justice shall be served in my eyes
Eradicate the flow of society
Joined hands together in unity

Justice for all as the saying goes
If you dont have the money it just isnt so

Decades of aggression towards a common source
The belief of freedom is murmured all at once
No choice for you or me
Free liberties are the promise yet to see
All are created equal as the saying goes
But if you look different its not so

So many colors races and creeds
But in the end is liberty guranteed?
Freedom of choice is up to you
Only if you follow through

So many colors races and creeds
But in the end is liberty guranteed?
Freedom of choice is up to you
