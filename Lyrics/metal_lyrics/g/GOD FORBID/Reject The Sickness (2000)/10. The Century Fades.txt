Death lies in wait, unready to reveal itself.
The emptiness of tradgedy left in its path.
Wrecking havoc, no not time or place only that it will be too late.

A dark mist falls before your eyes. the eternal
Sleep has become, no thoughts or words serene pleasure now exist.
Echos of laughter remain a fond memory.
