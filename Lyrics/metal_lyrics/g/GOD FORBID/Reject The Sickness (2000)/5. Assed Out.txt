Chosen few to walk in peace
Standing at the gate
Crossing all the fields of dreams you
Must not hesitate life has dealt the
Hand from hell which there is no escape
Testing all the cards of chance to unseal
Your fate

Assed out is what they see. on wrong move
Assed out they will be
Step by step they move searching viscously
Not knowing the price of their insanity

Assed out is what they see. assed out is what they ll be

Come into my realm of pain filled with deceit and lies
If you cross my path again you will meet your demise
Time has come to stand and what now must be done
If you chose to fight no more
You will now have won

Assed out
