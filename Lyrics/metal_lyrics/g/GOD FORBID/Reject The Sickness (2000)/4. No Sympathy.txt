Your words fill me with distrust
From all your spoken lies
Your speech means nothing to me
My hatred lasts forever

Will grow throughout the years
Will grow throughout the years

Language spoken silent has made it so real
Each waking momentleft your tragic end is near
Each waking moment left your tragic end is near

Laughter and chaos made intense your treacherous
Ways make no sense. disorted visions of the past
Dissillusioned by what is clear, you love to hate
What is feared
