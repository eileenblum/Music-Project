Try me again
No one believes
There is no concern
Only truth remains
Sorrow is discouragins, pain is absolute
Stress becomes the everyday
Agony leads to evil thought
Ravage thoughts open mind
Fear create my blood thirst
Murder seems rational
Lust sin cost life
Fall before the one theyll be no mercy
No return needless penance, justice served
