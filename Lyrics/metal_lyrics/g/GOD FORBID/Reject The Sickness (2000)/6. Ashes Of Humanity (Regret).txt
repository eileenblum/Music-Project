Why is it like that? my words have gone unheard
Things I meant to say, are lost never to be heard.
I loved you and now miss you
All my tears are now falling for my lost words.
I hope your happy where you are, rest in peace
Regret

The day of reckoning is now at hand, we will miss you
Until the end of time, my hope is that your free
Your new home I feel is good for you
Though I wish we could speak one last time.
Things neglected now seem so far away
I hope you can forgive me for what I had not said
Are you happy for this pain I feel. will I remember?
Yes I will, I will see you one day.
So rest in peace, good bye I will not forget the joy
You brought.
Your spirit is now endless
No more pain
