Saviors and sinners, all gather around
A moment of silence
Failure and judgment, cast them aside
Open your mind

Choices made, you're on your own
Promises betrayed. The seeds are sown
Voices linger, repeat the truth
I've witnessed my rebirth. Ends. With. You.

Charlatan, false prophet, look at yourself
A moment of silence

I beg the universe to show me the way
I said I'd give it all, close my eyes and pray
Steal another day

Choices made, you're on your own
Promises betrayed. The seeds are sown.
Voices linger, repeat the truth.
I've witnessed my rebirth. Ends. With. You.

(God ends with you)
Don't waste another day
Don't let it slip away
God. Ends. With. You. God. Ends. With. You.
Don't waste another day
Don't let it slip away
Don't waste another day
Don't let it slip away
