Why can't you see all the fury inside of me?
Why can't you see? Why can't you see it?

Alone with my thoughts as my mind begins to ponder
I see what we are, and the way were.
The lack of interest in my reality
A glimpse into my past, look towards the future.
The truth right before me
Standing, standing in a circle, in a circle of death all around me
My life exhumes an odor of survival

I want it all
As my world begins to crumble. The body starts to shake
Hoping everything will be ok
My sanity is fading. Lost within myself
Father...I will call to you, the depths to which we fall

In these changing times, loss of distinction is irrelevant
To a lasting existence

Let's go

I want it all
As my world begins to crumble. The body starts to shake
Hoping everything will be ok
My sanity is fading. Lost within myself
Father...I call to you, the depths to which we
The depths to which we fall, the depths to which we
