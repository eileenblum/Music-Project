We build this monument, there's only one more chance
I am the architect. We build these dreams
Something from nothing, again and again
This is unstoppable, this is unstoppable

Its how it always ends...I want to start again
Breaking down, but not within. Sometimes,
I'm overwhelmed by all I see
Broken Down, but never again.
My eyes are wide but forever, isn't faraway

I am the architect. We build these dreams
Something from nothing, again and again. This is unstoppable
Thank you for this day, one more chance to create

Its how it always ends...I want to start again
Breaking down, but not within.
Sometimes, I'm overwhelmed by all I see
Broken down, but never again
My eyes are wide but forever, isn't faraway

This is who I am. This is who I am
Destiny. I bend you to my will
Can't you see, its all part of me
This is who I am..I want to start again.

This is who I am...It's how it always ends
Destiny. I bend you to my will
Can't you see, it's all part of me
This is who I am...I want to start again
