Fire..this moment has arrived
Desire...take a look into my third eye

No one knows where life will lead us
Fate carries us up and down
Can't take it, can't trust, the words you uttered are busted
Broken, twisted, and bent but whole again

No time to rest. No time to wonder why
Walls closing in on all four sides
Where will this path lead? Realize what has been done
We must remember...where we all come from

Super elevated thoughts of you, thinking your words held the truth
My time and my patience has come and gone and been wasted
Force-fed your lies for far too long

No time to rest. No time to wonder why
Walls closing in on all four sides
Where will this path lead? Realize what has been done
We must remember...where we all come from

No time to rest, walls closing in
And will I die?

No time to rest. No time to wonder why
Walls closing in on all four sides
Where will this path lead? Realize what has been done
We must remember...where we all come from

Walls closing in on all four sides
