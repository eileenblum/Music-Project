Cut off at the knees
Forced to suffer, beg, and plead
God help me in this time of need
Life is fragile, it's here and gone
The ones we use to love have all moved on

Waking to a rising sun, a new day has begun
Under this blue sky, we give it one more try

A few good men walk alone
Back into the breach we go. A few good men walk alone

Taking giant steps along the way
Turning my dreams into reality
Looking forward, but I can't step aside
Anonymous whipsers will not die

Waking to a rising sun, a new day has begun
Under this blue sky, we give it one more try

A few good men walk alone
Back into the breach we go. A few good men walk alone.

Never, never, never
Go! Into the breach we go. A few good men walk alone
Into the breach we go. A few good men walk alone
