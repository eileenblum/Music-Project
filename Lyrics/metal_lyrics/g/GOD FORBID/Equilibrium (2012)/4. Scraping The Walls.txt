No sense of direction, my time is set
Will these feelings let me go?
Lost in the moments, caught in a world of madness
Pursue a vision, set your goal

I am scraping the walls again, making my way
And I am making my way. We all believe in a savior

A frameless picture, your sense of purpose.
Deliverance, free from doubt
Lost in the moment, caught in a world of madness
Pursue a vision, set your goal

And I am scraping the walls again, making my way
And I am making my way. We all believe in a savior

There's no time like now, caught in this moment
No sense of direction, my time is set
Step back and see the vision, a frameless picture
A sense of purpose
Deliverance, free from doubt
We all believe

No time like now, caught in this moment

And I am scraping the walls again, making my way
And I am making my way. We all believe in a savior
And I am scraping the walls again, making my way
And I am making my way. We all believe in a savior
