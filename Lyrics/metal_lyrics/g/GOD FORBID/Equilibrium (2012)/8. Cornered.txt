Looking for my purpose day by day
This madness around me drives me insane
You call yourself a friend, but I just feel the pain
I want my freedom back..before I snap

Full of rage and disgust. Broken down into pieces
Flames in my gut. I can take no more

Fighting for my survival, my placement in this game
Throughout the passing years...I have seen a lot of change

Full of rage and disgust. Broken down into pieces
Flames in my gut. I can take no more
Painted into a corner. Confused and fatigued
The emptiness has me intrigued. I can take no more

Downtime, the search within yourself
The great escape, to know who you are
When no one is around you
Flames in my gut

Downtime, the search within yourself
The great escape

Full of rage and disgust. Broken down into pieces
Flames in my gut. I can take no more
Painted into a corner. Confused and fatigued
The emptiness has me intrigued. I can take no more
