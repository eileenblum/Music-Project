I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not
Not ready to fall

No regrets, no dismay, nothing ventured and nothing gained
Never fear the storm of change, don't look back
I'm not ready to disappear. I won't go
Into the herd of forgotten sons
Seeds of doubt, sabotage with smiling faces

Tear down the walls and face your fears
And see what can become

Deception...infected thoughts to bring you down
Impossible...it's real, too real

Keep strong and realize
You have power..the power of one

Tear down the walls and face your fears
And see what can become
Th will, in your heart, will let you overcome

No regrets, no dismay, nothing ventured and nothing gained
Never fear the storm of change, don't look back
I'm not ready to fall...Fall...Fall...Fall

Tear down the walls and face your fears
And see what can become
The will, in your heart, will let you overcome
