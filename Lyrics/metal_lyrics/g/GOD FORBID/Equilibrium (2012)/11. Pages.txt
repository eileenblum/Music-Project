The night returns...they'll be no mystery
As the pages keep folding in time

To all those, to all those non-believers
Our path is lit for devastation
We will conquer deciders
The element of misguided authority

The night returns...they'll be no mystery
As the pages keep folding in time
The page is folding

A new day, a new day is upon us
Enlightenment
We will not submit to interrogation
Invasion of our privacy, no longer taken

We don't belong. We will not stand down
We can't let this go. We will not be forsaken

The night returns..they'll be no mystery
As the pages keep folding in time
The page is folding

As the pages keep folding us by

We don't belong. We can't let this go
We will not be forsaken. We will not be forsaken

The night returns..they'll be no mystery
As the pages keep folding in time
The night returns...they'll be no mystery
As the pages keep folding in time
The page is folding, the page is folding, yeah
