What was this choice? What was the choice you made?
What was the decision made?
How did you come to it? How has it affected?
And now what will you do?
What's in your brain? Answers given, words taken
What answers? Nothing is for certain
What was given to you, huh? But the one thing I know
What do you know huh? Tell me, what do you fucking know?

Torn apart but I'm still whole
(You've broken me from the inside out)
The blame is mine, but not alone
(I couldn't hate myself enough)

I never wanted to compromise, redefine the path in my life
See the malice behind your eyes, know the truth or desensitize
I can't let go! Down the drain I wander
Feel my pain mother fucker.

Lay your sins on me? I'll give it away
We all live again, we all live again
Now its time to move on. Set me free
We all live again, we all live again

My design will not be ignored. Refined...awakening
Witness the earth open up to you
Awakening
Why can't we live?

Finally , I'm coming to (The last drop from the hourglass)
Time to move on, time to move on
Move on...move on

I always wanted to overcome, become a man and never run
I see the light of the rising sun, this is my life, the only one
Make it so! Down the drain I conquer
Feel my pain you mother fucker

Lay your sins on me? I'll give it away
We all live again, we all live again
Now its time to move on. Set me free
We all live again, we all live again
Set me free
We all live again, we all live again
