The dirt of this world washes away as the sun disappears
Behind the cloud
A new start
The rebirth
Another chance

Rain on down
I don't mind the rain
It cleanses me
Hides the tears which cloud my vision
The vision to see

[Solo: Doc]

Past mistakes remove
You can try again
Inhale the air around you
Don't let time pass by

Rain on down
I don't mind the rain
It cleanses me
Hides the tears which cloud my vision
The vision to see

Not a care in this world
Not a care in this world
Live in this moment
Right here and now
Nothing is promised
Except for the storm

[Solo: Doc, Dallas]

And in this moment right here and now
I can't stop the rain
Release my pain
And let me breathe again
Prepare for the storm

Rain on down
I don't mind the rain
It cleanses me
Hides the tears which cloud my vision
The vision to see

Not a care in this world
Not a care in this world
And in this moment right here and now
I can't stop the rain
