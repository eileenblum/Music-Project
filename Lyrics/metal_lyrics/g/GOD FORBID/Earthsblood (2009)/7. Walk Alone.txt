[Solo: Doc]

Why would you walk into the fire?
Under a shield of love
I give myself to you
Tugging at the strings of my heart
Oh how I wish you were here
Turned on me, and left me empty
You took my heart and changed me
Under a shield of love
With every glance, I give myself to you

You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We step into the unknown
You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We step into the unknown

The pain I feel without you eats away at me
The slow drawn breath released from my body
Over
Over and over
The restriction of air
Shifting your point of view
Where do you take your stand?
What do you lose?
Addict
Under a shield of love
With every glance, I give myself to you

You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We step into the unknown
You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We become one

Broken down...my barriers
And walked right in
What do you lose?
The sacred bond we hold in our grasp is closer to hell
Than the heaven we see in our dreams

[Solo: Doc]

Broken down My barriers
And walked right in
You're tugging at the strings of my heart
Am I the fool for searching for the truth?
It's only lies...
It's only lies
If I find the truth I seek, I won't read the signs
Under a shield of love
With every glance, I give myself to you

You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We step into the unknown
You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We become one
