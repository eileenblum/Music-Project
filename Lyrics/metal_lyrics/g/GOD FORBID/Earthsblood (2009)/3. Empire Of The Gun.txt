It seems like yesterday
That day I held you in my arms
Now I'm gone
The warm embrace of my protector is lost forever
I will make it back to you or die trying
You are with me every step I take
I know not why
But I must honor you
I swear I will make it back home
Back home

Soldiers won't be cast into their afterlives
For a fight they never believed in
Go!

It seems like yesterday
That day I held you in my arms
Now I'm gone
The warm embrace of my protector is lost forever
I will make it back to you or die trying
You are with me every step I take
I know not why
But I must honor you
I swear I will make it back home
Back home

Soldiers won't be cast into their afterlives
For a fight they never believed in
I wasn't born to die

[Solo: Doc]

Empire of the gun
Empire the...gun
Empire of the gun
We will not fail
We will not falter
Empire of the gun

Soldiers won't be cast into their afterlives
For a fight they never believed in
I wasn't born to die
But I would sacrifice my life
