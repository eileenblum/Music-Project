Where do we go?
Where do we begin and end this journey?
My back
My back against the wall
And my head raised high
Forward against the odds
A heavy burden
Trapped between the extremes
Coming apart at the seams
Left alone to stand on my own

You're shallow
So shallow...
Come on

Here I am above the world trying to break you down
Misguided attempt to restore the balance
Isolation from the outside world
A heavy burden
Trapped between the extremes
Coming apart at the seams
Left alone to stand on my own

You're shallow
So shallow...
Come on

Surfacing above the world in suspended animation
Surfacing above the world in suspended animation
Beaten into the ground
Coming apart at the seams
You're shallow
