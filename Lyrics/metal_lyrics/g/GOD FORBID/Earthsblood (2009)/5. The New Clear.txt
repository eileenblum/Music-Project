It's all a dream
A spider's web
You're a number
Symbiosis
Symbiosis
The rhythm contorts
Stretches
Manipulates
Ii waits for an answer that never existed
Never existed
Never existed
Never existed
Never existed
We dream in blood and circuits
We dream in blood and circuits

Find me because I'm there
Find me because I'm there

You are all the abstract
You are nothing
Both the same

You are the new clear
You are the essence of our earth
And now I summon your spirit
Please God
I cherish my life

Our dreams are the only thing we have when things are down
Your courage to show the fool the world will clear the path

Find me because I'm there
Find me because I'm there

You are the new clear
You are the essence of our earth
And now I summon your spirit
Please God
I cherish my life

You're a clone of disaster
The edge of chaos
The beginning of life
The end of death
Pleased to meet you
My name is soul
Repeat after me
My name is soul
Soul
In dark spaces unknown to man
A mystical power lies within your hand

Find me because I'm there
Yeah

The paradox is heaven in our bones
The victors' book is lost

[Solo: Doc]

The paradox is heaven in our bones
The victors' book is...

Find me because I'm there
Yeah
Find me because I'm there
Yeah
