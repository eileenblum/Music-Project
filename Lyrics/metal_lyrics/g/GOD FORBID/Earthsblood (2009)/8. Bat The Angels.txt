Cast me to the fire
Nail me to the first cross you see
I am a sinner
I am a disgrace
These scars on my back will soon be replaced

We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels 'til they die

My dreams are that of an angel
And I believe the angel lives in me
I am a sinner
I am a disgrace
Feel this
This change through me
Feel this
The world will pay

We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels 'til they die

My dreams are that of an angel
And I believe the angel lives in me

Out the sky
We bat the angels out the sky
We bat the angels out the sky
