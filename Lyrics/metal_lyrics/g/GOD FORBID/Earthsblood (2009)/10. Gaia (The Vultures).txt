What is it you said?
Say it again you piece of shit
I spilled your blood, and the earth soaked it up
The blood in my veins fueled with the fire of past generations
I spilled your blood, and the earth soaked it up
You pulled the finger of the only one that left me in chains
I spilled your blood, and the earth soaked it up
Now I'll never walk away
Never walked away
I can't try to hear your words
I won't try to be a vulture
I thought I could turn away
Hide to try to live in this world

Gaia

What is it you said?
Say it again you piece of shit
I spilled your blood, and the earth soaked it up
The blood in my veins fueled with the fire of past generations
I spilled your blood, and the earth soaked it up
You pulled the finger of the only one that left me in chains
I spilled your blood, and the earth soaked it up
Now I'll never walk away
Never walked away
I can't try to hear your words
I won't try to be a vulture
I thought I could turn away
Hide to try to live in this world
Make of this what you will
Make of this what you will
