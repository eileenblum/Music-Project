Listen to these words of wisdom
It's time to break down the walls, break down the cries
And when I wake does the sun shine on me?
And when I sleep does the moon look from above?

It's time to break down the walls, break down the cries
It's time to break down the walls, break down the cries

And when I wake does the sun shine on me
And when I sleep does the moon look from above
Have you ever taken the time to judge the blood?
Have you ever taken the time to think about it?
