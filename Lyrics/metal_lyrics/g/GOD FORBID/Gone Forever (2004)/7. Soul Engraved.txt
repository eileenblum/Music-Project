And in the end I'll rise
Endured the event that should have been my demise
Looking forward to new life, my second chance
In a candid instance I witness life flash before my eyes
My sense of purpose is encouraged by my will to survive

Looking past that day toward my future.
What will it be? Knowing what must be done.

And it shows my seams are frayed,
Give me the strength,
Strength to face the day.

My soul has been engraved, give me
The strength, strength to make this change

Battered and torn form a selfless act,
My spirit not broken
I'm back with a vengeance, fists clenched,
To grasp this destiny
My will to conquer all,
Understanding of what I must do.
