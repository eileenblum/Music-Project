What exists around us?
The right to choose free spirit
Master of fate embrace
Time to judge them, aversion to believe the lies
What are we waiting for?
Preserving the right to decide

Unaware of what exists around us

Chasing the dreams, the shadows behind me
Everything's clear

Force-fed awaken realize
