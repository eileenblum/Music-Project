I lived all these years, Lost in a hollow shell
Darkness clouds the corners of my mind
Will I ever see the truth?
Will he ever reveal himself?

Will I be gone forever?
Will I disappear?

Mirrors all around
Destroy me, reflections move
Through the darkness
Yet I stand still in fear and suffering
Fear is the only end

I lived
