As the sunsets and life reverts to dust
Night falls over my eyes,
A sigh of relief for the end of this day
My hopes and dreams
Is this what has come to be?

Sky is gray washed out world
Deep in this place I won't go

Smell of rotting flesh, a look of disbelief
Wooden cinders scorched the earth
Mother forgive us what have we done?
What does the future hold?
