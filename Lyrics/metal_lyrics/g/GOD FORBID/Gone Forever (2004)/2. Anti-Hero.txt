Send us to die across the seas
Where it's told we want to deceive
Send us so far from home
Empty hearts want to believe the fight is for humanity
Look at yourself heroic state of existence
Patriot in your mind
Look around you, the world is caving in
Victim of life, the antihero
Torn between right and wrong the antihero
Black white dead all over
When does the war against war begin?
