Suicide on the horizon
I count these miseries to ten
Contempt is a lifestyle
Contempt is a lifestyle

The demons strike twice
Demons, these demons strike twice
Contempt is a lifestyle
Contempt is a lifestyle

Suicide on the horizon
I count these miseries to ten

These past of the tint of light turns to twilight
'Cause I won't understand
Better days
'Cause I won't understand

'Cause I won't
Bow down won't let this eat me alive
Crawl out of my hole
Exorcise the demons

Better days
These past of the tint of light turns to twilight
'Cause I won't understand
Better days
'Cause I won't understand
