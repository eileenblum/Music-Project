The weight of the world
Upon me, what do I seek?
The horror of what has become
The touch of your hand

She was a precious lie
I always dreamed of
Took lust into love

The power behind your eyes
Makes me believe
My faith in you
Can do no wrong
I would crash the gates of hell

Is this where I belong?
