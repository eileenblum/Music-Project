Into the wasteland we ride;
Aftermath of this guilt-stricken world
Misled and deprived... conscious... A call to arms
A pawn in this new world order
Amongst the chaos, change of importance
My deliverance, will to survive
Burn the city; erase our people
All is lost; this flag will fly high
A transformation... my awakening to the truth
As I struggle... to exist, where the weak are cast aside
Amongst the chaos, change of importance
My deliverance, will to survive
Burn the city; erase our people
All is lost; this flag will fly high
Released from my prison; an invisible cage
My relentless urge to: fight, fight, fight
