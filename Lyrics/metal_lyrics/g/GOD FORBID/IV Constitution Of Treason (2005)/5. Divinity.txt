Demise of my virtue, was created by
My decision to cross the line in the sand
And on that day I realized the divinity of it all
Deep inside my mind I was wrong,
The only question left to burn
You will be judged for your crimes against,
You will be judged for your insolence
Bind yourself with these chains they'll heal you
This is your last chance to realize
Deep inside my mind I was wrong,
The only question left to burn
Deep inside my mind I was wrong,
The only question left to burn
We'll be purified, when we ask for rain
We'll be purified, when we ask for rain
See the light of my divinity
See the light of my divinity
