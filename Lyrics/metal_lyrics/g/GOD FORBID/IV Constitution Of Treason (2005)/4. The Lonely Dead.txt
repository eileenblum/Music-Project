Alone is to feel death crawling beneath your skin
We must remember the dead
I look down to the ground before me
Worried no longer, we were free for the first time
Now more lonely than we ever been
Around the fire we wonder; if they are alone as we are
The lonely dead lonely
Alone is to feel death crawling beneath your skin
We must remember the dead
Around the fire we wonder; if they are alone as we are
The lonely dead lonely
Dead we are the lonely dead, dead we are the lonely dead
When we speak we speak of the new age
And we realize the dead
Our lives in the ruin of change
Our first choice was to bury them
Our first choice was to bury them
Dead we are the lonely dead, dead we are the lonely dead
When we speak we speak of the new age
And we realize the dead
Our lives in the ruin of change
Dead we are the lonely dead, dead we are the lonely dead
