Perception governs the democracy
It no longer exists; constricting my ignorance
Freeing my soul
Lost in time
Will I ever get high enough to see?
I'm at the end of the line
I must break these chains of humanity
Euphoria transcends my reality
Spiritual disaster at my fingertips
Judgment day has come at last
The clouds bleed black
As the tentacles of the divine
Replace my blood
Strength beyond strength
It's time to take 'em down
Take down the oppressor
It's time to take 'em down
It's time to bow before
Strength beyond strength
Judgment day has come at last
The clouds bleed black
As the tentacles of the divine
Replace my blood
It's time to take 'em down
Take down the oppressor
It's time to take 'em down
It's time to bow before
Strength beyond strength
