Every day I live, I remember the sacrifice
Every day I live, I ensure it's not in vain
For those who gave their all
You shall live again through me
My solemn vow you are forever now
This may be the last we see our hero
This is an oath to the fallen heroes
This is an ode to the ones we lost
This was then and now,
The last days before return
The memory will not be silenced or erased
In the glory of your worth
This is an oath to the fallen heroes
This is an ode to the ones we lost
This is an oath to the fallen heroes
This is an ode to the ones we lost
I... I'm dying again
This was then and now the last days before return
The memory will not be silenced or erased
May your deed bring peace?
A new resolution of change
This is an oath to the fallen heroes
This is an ode to the ones we lost
I... I'm dying again
This is an oath to the fallen heroes
This is an ode to the ones we lost
I... I'm dying again
