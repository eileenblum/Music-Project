This is the tale of Mr. Black
Broken down and beaten
A product of an enraged nation
Mr. Green-church never obeyed his pact to the masses
Then led us to a path of apathy
Now they all sit with a sense of false security
Their lie is in the truth of program
This episode of existence has come to a bitter end
And now it's time to tell ourselves
We wrote the constitution of treason
The unspoken demise of an unbroken nation
We wrote the constitution of treason
The unspoken demise of an unbroken nation
We are the traitors to our own kind
We have one last chance to make things right
Our nemesis is our way of life
Bring 'em down, strap 'em up, no remorse
Cross out the lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
A whisper and a breath has blood running from my eyes
In the last days of man the world is flipped upside down
A superficial account of importance
A greed ridden place of an remorse
Look between us and lies, this twisted reality
Look between us and lies, this twisted reality
We wrote the constitution of treason
The unspoken demise of an unbroken nation
We are the traitors of our own kind
We have to make things right
Our nemesis is our way of life
Bring 'em down, strap 'em up, no remorse
Cross out the lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
