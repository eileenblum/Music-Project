The spirit to walk within, this circle of life
My hope, my wish, my thought
To travel a road of judgment
Gripped between two worlds... a battle of acceptance
For who I am uncertainty has plagued my way
Under this flag, this badge I wear
I find my strength, my will motherfucker
My will to carry on
My will to carry on
Now you're lost, it's a prison inside of me
There's no doubt as to who I am?
Lost your touch all I can do is die inside
There's no chance
No I will find the answer
These hidden powers in me... stand tall and persist
My will be done
Under this flag, this badge I wear
I find my strength, my will motherfucker
My will to carry on
My will to carry on
Now you're lost, it's a prison inside of me
There's no doubt as to who I am?
Lost your touch all I can do is die inside
There's no chance
I traveled this world to find the best in me
The answers for sure as my reflection stares back at me
