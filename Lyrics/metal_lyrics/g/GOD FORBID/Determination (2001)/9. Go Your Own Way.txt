Forget you all and your rules
They are pointless; I go my own way
Will take what I need, what I want
They tried to sway me: my thought and actions
I'm not trying to hear it (I can't hear you) I do what I want

My path chosen is narrow; it leads me there [2x]
It has been written; if I fall let, me be

It works for me
I go my own way; to err is human [2x]
Scream as I inflict vengeance
Love and hatred go hand and hand
Emerging Love and hatred
