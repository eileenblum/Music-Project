Prey to your god,
So sinister, yet so commonplace... Subconscious network

The Erie light you worship so readily
Peer in your eyes, in your mind.

Used you as your own enemy...
Fixate on its gloried role.

Profiled and led away, from the truth, like many fools
Some hope of a way to brake its glare

Masses steered by fabricated thoughts, societies wet dream and its goals,
Societies wet dream,

A long forgotten past,
Replaced by what is "now",
Reeling out of control, growing,
Finite possibilities lay in wait.
