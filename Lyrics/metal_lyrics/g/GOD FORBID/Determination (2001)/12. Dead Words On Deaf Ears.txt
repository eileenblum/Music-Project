Figures that lie; concealed; wait unannounced
Lie stricken with fear paralyzed, to cold around you
Silence, the answer given
Flustered, when questions arise

Do not look towards me for you inclusion
You are alone, Fate a clever disregard for life

But the return of doubt, awaits,
Mirroring changes keep the process alive,
As life gives way Mirroring changes
Devastation the answer, how it has come to be,
Deliverance from harm is your hope of attrition
For what, was said the frivolous response which is now clear
Dead words on deaf ears
