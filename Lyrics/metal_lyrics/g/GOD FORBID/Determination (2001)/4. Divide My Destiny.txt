In time all things become clear
This line as I proceed to follow
I see what is preferred
Divide my destiny, the only thing that matters
Are the ones I left behind?
Their words ring out with truth

Comfort your cries no longer
We are through, no one to pick you up
When you fall down
We who watch and feel your pain

Nor will I allow those around me to poison my judgment I know, what is best
For me, I am able to decide what is destiny

Searching for someone; some to be there...
My destiny
Their words hold truth
