Where do we come from, where do we go from here [4x]
Where are we now; we are right here

With every bit of my strength left, I will fight for what's mine is mine
Clever of you to avoid the truth, and hide your evil ways
No sympathy is what I yield, my anger knows no bounds
With every bit of my strength left, I will fight for what's mind is mine
No sympathy is what I yield, my anger knows no bounds

No can hold me, no can know my pain
If I am breathing, my lie is still the same
I see what you hide, gaze into beyond and realize

May your deeds crumble beneath your feet?
Leaving you... Helpless and Alone
