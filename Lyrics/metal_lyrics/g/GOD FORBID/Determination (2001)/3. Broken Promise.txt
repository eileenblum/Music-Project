Arcane events bring new vision
The claws you wield are visible
Echoes of souls you have taken
Cry out; cry out in anguish

I uncloak anger... my anger I have for you
Broken promises, turned your back on me
Surrendered my own judgment for you
Fell Victim to your charm surrendered

Found in you no wrong
Would have trade life for you

Souls cry out in anguish
My skin now hardened by mistrust
Reality awaken by your; hollow touch
Permanent scar now remains
