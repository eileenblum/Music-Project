I hear the voice... of an old friend, he calls to me
When I am subdued
Loud as day, I here this voice call to me in distress
What to do, I feel the presence of another

As I walk through the house where he once lived
He means no hard, come to me when confused
Helps to relieve doubt, led me through ups and downs, I call him a friend

My one true friend, always there to help
Me through my darkness
What to do, I feel the presence
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing...
