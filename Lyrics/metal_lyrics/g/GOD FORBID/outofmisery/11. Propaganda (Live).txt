[originally by Sepultura]Why Don't You Get A Life And Grow Up
Why Don't You Realize That You're Fucked Up
Why Criticize What You Don't Understand
Why Change My Words, You're So Afraid

You Think You Have The Right To
Put Me Down
Propaganda Hides Your Scum
Face To Face You Don't Have A Word To Say
You Got In My Way, Now You'll Have To Pay

Don't, Don't Believe What You
See
Don't, Don't Believe What You Read
No!!!

I Know My Ways, I'm Here To Stay
I Didn't Start All This Yesterday
I'll Prove You Wrong All The Way
Life Teaches Me You're Always Alone

Don't, Don't Believe What You
See
Don't, Don't Believe What You Read
No!
