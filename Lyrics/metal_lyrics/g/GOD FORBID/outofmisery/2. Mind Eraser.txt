Sacrifice,can you feel the hand
of god oppose your will to die...
your time has now come...
you are satan's son,
the end of life is near, your death is clear
the time of life is short, you are now reborn.

Time to die, hear the cries, damned souls
returning from inside. You can't escape
though you try, there's nothing left but to die.
Your time has come you are Satan's son,
you feel the hand of god oppose you will to die.
Your life is now here your rebirth is clear.
Time to die, hear the cries,
damned souls returning from inside.
