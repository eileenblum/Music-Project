Habeeber comes across the seas,
He searches now for you and me,
His blood it boils for our way of life
He kisses his family and says goodbye
New faces new lands new chances old plans
Prepare now he takes from you Habeeber

Ripping through your soul just like a knife,
Hunting like a demon out for your life,
Killing all that you care for crushing all that you have in store,
Living in a life that wants you not surviving as your mind slowly rots
Living inside a burning spell haunted by Habeeber's hell
Do not sleep on them

Anger what feeds my brain, pain pumps through my veins
Arrogance consequence discipline through death
Vengeance shall be ours even if I am torn apart
Destruction in my path disgust runs my mind,
Pain makes me laugh soon will be my time.
End now wicked plot as I have no fear finish now right here let me stand no longer
