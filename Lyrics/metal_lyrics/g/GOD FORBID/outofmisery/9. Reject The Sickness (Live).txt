shattered dreams of you and i.
m always awakened distilled by tourtured lies
growing through out eternity
the love that died is now eating at me,
choice made to prolong death
the empty feeling of your last caress

no one knows where the time has gone
destined to stand all alone,thriving off the
anguish of life
the broken hopes of yesterday forsaken to believe
the fire burned beneath,he fear has become stronger
behind her stubborn pride

state of confusion
reject the sickness

torn between love and hate.that is what i feel
hoping to understand why,my heart aches for you as you
crush my pride

my soul cant find rest,a contrast in view has made it clear
thoughts shared were untrue.cloned feelings of past failures

state of confusion
reject the sickness

shattered dreams of you and i,awakened distilled by tortured lies
growing through out eternity. the loved that died
is now eating me.
choice made to prolong the death
the empty feeling of your last caress
