The guilty go free
While innocence is tortured
Beyond the shield of justice lies
The whip of shame
Truth not for everyone
Get up and grab yourself a gun
The time for anarchy will reign
To be the one behind the darkest lies

As you stand before the altar you will see the gavel
Of Justice bring you chained to slaughter
Festering ashes, left in dismay
Rotting corpses, never to breathe again
Sadistic judge one sided untrue ready to stand and devour you
You must stay true, to what you do

The guilty go free
While the innocence is tortured
Beyond the shield of justice lies
The whip, the whip, the whip, of shame
Never to know your name

Never, never to see the light
Captured souls lost all rights
You cannot believe in the right
All justice has lost sight
The time is now for you to see
How your soul belongs to me
You cannot believe in the right
All justice has lost the sight
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to be
Madman are now free

You!
You cannot believe in the right
All justice has lost sight
Is now for you to see
Your life now belongs to me
