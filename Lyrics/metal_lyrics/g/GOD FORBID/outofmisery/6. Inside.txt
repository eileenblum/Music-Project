Love, the ultimate lie
Buried beneath the, crimson eye
Truth told through, erotic dreams
Nothing is, but what it seems
To know love, the essence of hate
By now you'll see, it's too late

You
Come feel my pain,
Your love drives me insane
Follow me
You. Hate. Fear. Hope. Me insane.
Follow me, to the ends of the earth
Trust in me, for what it's worth
Feel. You. Hate. Trust.
Follow me, to the ends of the earth
Trust in me, for what itâs worth
Come inside
Follow me
Trust in me

My longing, for your love, is no lie
The truth hidden, in your eyes
Feelings, that overwhelm my soul
When I know, I'm inside
Follow me, to the ends of the earth
Trust in me, for what it's worth
I'm inside
