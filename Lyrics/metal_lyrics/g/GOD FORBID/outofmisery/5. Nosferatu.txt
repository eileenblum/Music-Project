He's coming
He's coming
Nosferatu's coming

He's coming for your life, almighty evil
Nosferatu ruler of the night
Once bit you are his slave, forever more
Damned to the grave
You will see how you become one of them
Right in front of you
Nothing left that you can say, and thatâs because
All you must do is die

Nosferatu comes for you
Rules your life and all you do
Now, the time, has come, you are the one
You, have now, been chosen, as his son
If, you stand, before, the master's throne
You, will see, your life, you're all alone

Nosferatu comes for you
Rules your life and all you do
Nothing more that you can say
Nosferatu comes your way
Now, the time, has come, you are the one
You, have now, been chosen, as his son
If, you stand, before, the master's throne
You, will see, your life, you're all alone

Nosferatu
Ruler of the night
Can't you see, him standing there, besides the walls?
Burning life, taking what, he needs to feed
Time has come, you are the one, you have no choice
Took your life, and your soul, you lost your voice

Nosferatu
Ruler of the night
Nosferatu
Heâs taking my own life

The ruler walks though the darkness
Through the fields of the dead
He's standing beside you
Controlling your head
Nosferatu
The ruler of the night
Nosferatu
Heâs taking my own life
He's back from the grave
You will be his slave
Oh my God what can you do?
Here comes Nosferatu
Nosferatu
Nosferatu

Now, thereâs nothing you can do
The rash is on its way
Heâs chosen it for you
The time is on your side
You will die here tonight
Thereâs nothing left to say
There asking now, are they?
Nosferatu comes for you
