Quietly but always watching
Hidden in the night
Eagerly waiting the morrow
Hidden from your sight

Spotted only in your dreams
But nevertheless there
Lurking back from out your vision
Never seem to care

Repelled only by a knife
Their kind will bring you fear
Follow not their song in darkness
it Leads away from here

Female faeries, frightful horrors
Riding on the storm
Luring travellers away
In their hideous form

They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight

They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight

Semblance of a poor old woman
In ash-coloured clothes
Apron thrown across the shoulder
But it's you she loathes

Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside

Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside

They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight

They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight

Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside

Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside
