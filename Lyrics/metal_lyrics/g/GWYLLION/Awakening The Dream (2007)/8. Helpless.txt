See me wandering, in the darkest deep of shadows
The world above so bright, my dearest enemy
Where once lived happiness, where sorrow couldn't bear
But I am drowning here, too far to even care

See me wandering, alone and cold and bare
My deepest memories, no grief, no sadness there
It's dark and cold in here, in this forgotten lair
Loneliness prevails, how could I ever dare

I can't pray for mercy, 'cause there's no soul to hear
So I stay here, helpless, in my remains of sense
There's no place for regret, 'cause only I am here
So I remain helpless, behind this solid fence

Hear me muttering, of long forgotten times
My head is bursting, with long and brutal chimes
Still can see the past, a road enclosed by limes
But haunting through my head, are black, distorted rhymes

Hear me muttering, about my dreadful debt
I can't remember why, so long my soul has slept
Immortal, my regret, endless have I wept
No tears will wash away, the secret I have kept

I can't pray for mercy, 'cause there's no soul to hear
So I stay here, helpless, in my remains of sense
There's no place for regret, 'cause only I am here
So I remain helpless, behind this solid fence

Can't you see why I am weeping,
can't you see that I repent?
No one knows the pain that I feel,
no one knows just what I meant

Years will come and years will pass but
I can't leave this unlocked cell
Leaves will grow and leaves will fall but
endless is this living hell

There's no soul that lives in darkness,
no soul knows eternal pain but
My soul will forever perish,
evermore 'till I'm insane

I can't pray for mercy, 'cause there's no soul to hear
So I stay here, helpless, in my remains of sense
There's no place for regret, 'cause only I am here
So I remain helpless, behind this solid fence
