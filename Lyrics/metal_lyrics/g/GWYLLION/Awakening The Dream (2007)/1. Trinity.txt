Right on the eve of battle,
Next to the battleground
Two brothers stood there quietly
Expecting yet the third

Legend tells us of the brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are unified

Once for truth and once for wisdom,
Prophecies and visions fade
Once for love, once for horror
Fading in the night

This is not the truth, but not a lie
It is no wisdom but a...

Right on the eve of battle,
Next to the battleground
The third was striding to his kin
United once again

Legend tells us of the brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are unified

Never linger
Soon you will find the way
Through the never
Sadness will go astray
Lead the way
Harvest the day
Soon you will find your way

Once for truth and once for wisdom,
Prophecies and visions fade
Once for love, once for horror
Fading in the night

Never linger
Soon you will find the way
Through the never
Sadness will go astray
Lead the way
Harvest the day
Soon you will find your way

Trice denied, still believing
Standing up to the world
Three will stand after all is gone
The Holy Brotherhood

Right on the edge of battle,
Deep in the battleground
The Trinity is striking back
United once again

Legend tells us of the brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are unified

The legend tells of brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are one!
