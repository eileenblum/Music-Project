It was for you
All that was true
For this ending shall not come

In my heart you belong
Makes me weak, makes me strong
Feels like dying though I belong

Fear all the thoughts I had
My memories became more than that
My tears keep on flowing
The wind keeps on blowing
Forever you are

Deep within it is so clear
Where it begins can't we just be near
I keep on searching
The next thing that's lurking
Forever you are me

All I have now
Is my sad cry
Should I wonder what shall come

All the lies beyond the secret's fading
My own mind becomes a dreadful trap
For you came to me strangely behaving
Maybe all of this is to forget

Fear all the thoughts I had
My memories became more than that
My tears keep on flowing
The wind keeps on blowing
Forever you are

Deep within it is so clear
Where it begins can't we just be near
I keep on searching
The next thing that's lurking
Forever you are me

All the lies beyond the secret's fading
My own mind becomes a dreadful trap
For you came to me strangely behaving
Maybe all of this is to forget

All the lies beyond the secret's fading
Maybe all of this is to forget
For you came to me strangely behaving
My own mind becomes a dreadful trap
