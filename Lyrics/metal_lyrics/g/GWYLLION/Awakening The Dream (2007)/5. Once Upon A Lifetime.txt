Once upon a lifetime
Never far away
Once upon a lifetime
It leads you astray

On your path to glory
It takes you by surprise
On your path to glory
You will meet your demise

How
Should I
Know?
What I will see?
What I will think?
What I'll be feeling?

Should I embrace this vision
Should I despise these thoughts?
Should I despise this vision
Should I embrace these thoughts?

I will acknowledge your voice
I will concede
I will acknowledge your voice
I will pay heed

(Can't see, is there)
No
Way for me?
Can't I flee?
Am I
Free?
I can't see...
Won't I be?

Is there
No
Way for me?
Can't I flee?
Am I free?
I can't see...
Won't I be?

I am!

Dreams unfold as days go by
And stars stand brightly in the sky
I will never say goodbye
'cause this will last until I die

I will embrace this vision
I won't despise these thoughts
I won't despise this vision
I will embrace these thoughts

I will acknowledge your voice
I will concede
I will acknowledge your voice
I will pay heed
