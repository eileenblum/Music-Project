Could this be the end of thoughts
A lesson to recall
A start to feel this fight of mercy
A breathless thought of sin

Cause every time the earth moves
I start choking
I wander off alone
Cause every time the lie fools
I am falling
It's a reason to go insane

Hear my pride
I'm already wasted
With every thought
Inner fight
I'm already fading

Look away beyond goodbye
Where the lightning strikes inside
Maybe for one day release it
With a perfect world in sight

Cause every time the earth moves
I am crawling
I start dreaming of what has been
Cause every time I feel that
Of what I'm choosing
Don't you hear the sound of sin

Hear my pride
I'm already wasted
With every thought
Inner fight
I'm already fading

I found my strength in those
that didn't want to compliment me
My only reason to embrace this life
Is on defensive

Hear my pride
I'm already wasted
With every thought
Inner fight
I'm already fading
