Heralds of progression gather
A plot wrought in malignant delight
There's nothing that lasts forever
But nothing will change our faith tonight

Ages of knowledge rejected
Searching for more but there's less to find
Answers remain undetected
Questions arise inside

The heart of our dream lies shattered
Came to an end in the dead of night
NaÃ¯ve aspiration scattered
In new-born obsession to ignite

Ages of knowledge rejected
Searching for more but there's less to find
Answers remain undetected
But questions arise inside

Burden so deep
Hindrance so steep
Eternal sleep
Seduce me...

Chasing the wind like a spirit fly
Through autumn trees towards the sky
Drifting away as years pass by
On the roots that we deny

Chasing the wind like a spirit fly
Through autumn trees towards the sky
Drifting away as years pass by
From the roots that we deny

From the roots that we defy

On these roots we still rely
