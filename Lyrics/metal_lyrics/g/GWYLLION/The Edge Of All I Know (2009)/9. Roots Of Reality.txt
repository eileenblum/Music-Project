Soon the daylight will come, then it will be gone
For now the wicked control the void in my soul
Doubt is ruling my mind, and
I found out nighttime awakens the beast inside
Flee the recurring dream that's haunting me

Silent the night awakens me
With the song of an evening breeze
Open my eyes but I can't see
And all motion seems to freeze

Question the roots of reality
But the notion seems so real
Trapped in a state no-one can flee
When there's nothing left to feel

Soon the daylight will come, then it will be gone
For now the wicked control the void in my soul
Doubt is ruling my mind, and
I found out nighttime awakens the beast inside
Flee the recurring dream that's haunting me
and you

Nightmare awakens the fear in my heart
In a never-ending theme
Feel insanity rising up in me
How do I know it's a dream?

Even the man who is pure in the heart
And speaks in prayer by night
May become the wolf when the wolfs-bane blooms
And the winter moon is bright

Silent the night awakens me
With the song of an evening breeze
Open my eyes but I can't see
And all motion seems to freeze

Question the roots of reality
But the notion seems so real
Trapped in a state no-one can flee
When there's nothing left to feel

Soon the daylight will come, then it will be gone
For now the wicked control the void in my soul
Doubt is ruling my mind, and
I found out nighttime awakens the beast inside
Flee the recurring dream that's haunting me
and you

When the night conquers all I can see
And my soul yearns to be set free
Time to be remembered what used to be
And to wonder who used to be me
