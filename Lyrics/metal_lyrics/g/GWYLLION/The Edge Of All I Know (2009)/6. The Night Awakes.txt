The night awakes, a storm in sight
Seek everything you want to hide tonight
The selfish hide away into their homes

The breeze betrays what lies in sight
For everything you want to fight tonight
And maybe you'll awake before it's dawn

Fear - a distant emotion, feeding your anger and whispering doubt in your mind
Faith - deceitful devotion, bleeding in madness, delivering hope for the blind
Trust - a word with the power to grant you freedom, if you can leave all else behind
Truth - the hunger for knowledge, one of the greatest virtues of mankind

The prospect of an epic fight
Is masking fears with pure delight
No thoughts are spent on that what lies ahead

Adrenaline rules basic fright
No profit is found in defeat tonight
No heartbeat is delayed before it's dawn

Fear - a distant emotion, feeding your anger and whispering doubt in your mind
Faith - deceitful devotion, bleeding in madness, delivering hope for the blind
Trust - a word with the power to grant you freedom, if you can leave all else behind
Truth - the hunger for knowledge, one of the greatest virtues of mankind

Goodbye to life as you've known it all
Everything you've ever fought before
Cause maybe the truth is what lies ahead
And maybe the strength is yourself instead

Fear - a distant emotion, feeding your anger and whispering doubt in your mind
Faith - deceitful devotion, bleeding in madness, delivering hope for the blind
Trust - a word with the power to grant you freedom, if you can leave all else behind
Truth - the hunger for knowledge, one of the greatest virtues of mankind
