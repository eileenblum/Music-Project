Silence, breathing, honour by surprise
Weeping clearly through disguise
Seeking, reaching out into a depth
Longing, ruling, try to hide

Fear all you fear when clouds disappear
Behind all the madness you try to be unseen

Hunger, raging, sense to feel alive
Charging knowledge, see no crime
Depend, awake, all the senses burn
Feeling, seeking to return

Fear all you fear when clouds disappear
Behind all the madness you try to be unseen

Faster, stronger, than the average
Every bone seeks all it missed
Burning darkness creeps inside of me
Maybe I am my own enemy

Fear all you fear when clouds disappear
Behind all the madness you try to be unseen

Lay down the pain that you felt deep inside
I know how it feels to burn your heart out
Clearly I'm not judging on anything
Lay down the rage that you want to set free

Lay down the pain that you felt deep inside
I know how it feels to burn your heart out
Clearly I'm not judging on anything
Lay down the rage that you want to set free

Trusted the voices
That cried out my name
We had no options
We chose the same

Hunting, further than I've ever gone
Chasing beyond what I've done
Searching reasons to endure this pain
Anger, sadness, go insane

Fear all you fear when clouds disappear
Behind all the madness you try to be unseen

Lay down the pain that you felt deep inside
I know how it feels to burn your heart out
Clearly I'm not judging on anything
Lay down the rage that you want to set free
