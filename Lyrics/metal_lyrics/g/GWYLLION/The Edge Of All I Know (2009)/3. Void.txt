Take your leave tonight

Destination hidden
On a path so clear
How can someone so close be so hard to find

Close my eyes, remember
Anger flows inside
Hide the pain and all the fears inside my mind

Feel the void inside me
Hear the silent decree
Taste the emptiness and take your leave

Loneliness surrounds me
Solitude defines me
Taste the emptiness and take your leave tonight

In my dreams appearing
Lost within my sight
Blackened is the void within when all else dies

I see you approaching
Ignorant, sincere
I'm impassive but inside my fears arise

Feel the void inside me
Hear the silent decree
Taste the emptiness and take your leave

Loneliness surrounds me
Solitude defines me
Taste the emptiness and take your leave tonight

Once upon a failing star
I feel you inside me
A fleeting glimpse felt from afar
But you're not here to see...

Take your leave tonight

Feel the void inside me
Hear the silent decree
Taste the emptiness and take your leave

Loneliness surrounds me
Solitude defines me
Taste the emptiness and take your leave tonight

Destination hidden
On a path so clear
I should care less but reprise, feel tears arise

I see death in your eyes
You're deaf to my cries
But you'll never be the last thing on my mind

Feel the void inside me
Hear the silent decree
Taste the emptiness and take your leave

Loneliness surrounds me
Solitude defines me
Taste the emptiness and take your leave tonight
