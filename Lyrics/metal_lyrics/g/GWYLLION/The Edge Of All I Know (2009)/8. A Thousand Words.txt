Deep behind chestnut eyes
Lies a secret known to few
Proud, enclosing no lies
A deep-brown that speaks to you

Standing tall across the room, a world is in between
Too far away to reach you, yet so close that I can
Feel you inside of me
On the edge of all I know a voice calls out to me
I listen harder than before but
I cannot hear what it's saying to me...

Deep within my own chest
Lies a weight too hard to bear
Straight, exposing but jest
A posture that's hard to wear

Standing tall across the room, a world is in between
Too far away to reach you, yet so close that I can
Feel you inside of me
On the edge of all I know a voice calls out to me
I listen harder than before but
I cannot hear what it's saying to me...

A look, inner self exposed
Understanding without speech
A touch, in silence enclosed
For a thousand words to breach

Standing tall across the room, a world is in between
Too far away to reach you, yet so close that I can
Feel you inside of me
On the edge of all I know a voice calls out to me
I listen harder than before but
I cannot hear what it's saying to me...
