Long ago
I attended in a dream
Left behind
In my misery, groaned with pain

Crazed inside
Anxious and furious derailed
Lost in motion
No-one was left to blame

And it, it hurt inside

People tried to warn me of the past, the track would hunt me down so fast...

Looked up
Memorised the eternal rain
Took a notion of clearance
My future gain

And it, it hurt inside

Filled my mind
With a future
A life ahead

People tried to warn me of the past, the track would hunt me down so fast...

Never saw the trail of lies, the fight, the cries that sprung into my eyes

Lately I feel I'm suffocating
Down in happiness
I'm drowning in a river of a life I never had

It feels so irreversible
A break, a crack, a split
A notion of insanity
Is lurking in my head

Will you be mine, my life, by my side
My trust, my truth, my sacrifice
Cause you're the only one I want
The one I depend on

A light awakes, a rule to break
A finalised embrace
A turn into a formal space
Forever undying maze

Long ago
I attended in a dream
Left behind
In my misery, groaned with pain

Crazed inside
Anxious and furious derailed
Lost in motion
No-one was left to blame

And it, it hurt
