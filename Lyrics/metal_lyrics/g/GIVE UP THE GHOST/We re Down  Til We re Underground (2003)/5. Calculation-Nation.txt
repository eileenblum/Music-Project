You and me equals we (add it) I am one life minus one And it is my math to do So fuck you (And you don't understand 'WE' 'cause
you don't understand 'ME') I'm sorry, so sorry, for not making sense I have been shot in the left side of my chest The dust in
the air, that irritates my eyes, floats in the light that beams from the hole in my chest
