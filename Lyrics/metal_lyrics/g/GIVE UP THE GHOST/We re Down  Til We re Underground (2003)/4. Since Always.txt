Cold cold keep shakinf Sing sing keep sinking Let the cars keep swerving Let the songs keep skipping Crush crush keep kissing
Shoot shoot keep missing I used to compare myself, but I don't care anymore I never had it You never had it We were young and the
sun didn't shine on us Where's the life you thought you'd live? Where's the life you thought you'd give? Sipping on sympathy
Feeding on tragedy This is our therapy, for open heart surgery I never had it You never had it We were young and the sun didn't
shine on us Where's the life you thought you'd live? Where's the life you thought you'd give? I'll never have it You'll never
have it We were young and the rains came down on us We're humming 'Reveille' just slightly out of key (our love is real to me) In
Sundays best singing free of things we'd like to be In leftover puddles we drown ourselves quietly This is our therapy This is
for you and me Our love is real to me
