Jesus and all his saints couldn't save our wretched face And no man parting some sea could keep you from me We had to walk away
from the streets that knew our names I stutter soft and say "I'd give you anything Anything and everything And you can tell the
town We're down til we're underground" We last the heartache sound when our order was found I burned a testament that misused
'heaven-sent' We made a comeback and it, it was recieved quite well The carth, for all it's worth, never seemed so far from hell
Preach on and on Spread the good word of the holy healing Breathe in, breathe out and on Likely lifers put to song and dance and
air has never seemed so clear I got a love/hate relationship with love and hate I get lost here and there, You could say I was
into the fact you even cared I'm a believer of there's nothing up above that could or should replace my Sunday's saving grace I
repeat the times that I said you don't exist My gospels from the church of Radio Activists
