Sitting only cuz I couldn't stand to walk much further under black skies with watered eyes I was watching the tide rolling in
And I was thinking I should make fun here and start over again My legs barely hold all of my heart and soul My ears hardly hear
only our sound is clear My mouth merely moves the words just disappear My eyes see so clear the reason to care Maybe we weren't
supposed to wake up today Leaving me room only to celebrate that nothing's changed If I was there- If you were here the world
could end I wouldn't care So wake me up never, please, lock the door, and lose the keys My legs barely hold all of my heart and
soul My ears hardly hear only our sound is clear My mouth merely moves the words just disappear My eyes see so clear the reason
to care To set the record straight- I never could relate And just when it all went wrong- You sang a different song Never knew
someone who knew how the years had been and I never thought that I would ever end up like this So hidden, far and gone, I'm so crowded
alone And I hope you understand, you fixed my broken plan
