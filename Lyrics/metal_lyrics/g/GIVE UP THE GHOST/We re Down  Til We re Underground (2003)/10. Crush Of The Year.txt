The future could be ours or, it could just be yours We could just be walking closer to closed doors It was spoken, then broken-
we're hoping arms are open A wedding rings surrendering, and dying pretty is living well Just press stop Take it out, turn it
off- return it I've got reasons for everything- everything except this We could be the B-side to their hit song without no soul
We could sound like things were fine, and find out they weren't at all We could go back to where we once lived life but felt so
small Back where we started which was nowhere at all Just press stop Take it out, turn it off- return it I've got reasons for
everything- everything except this This is a remix of the same tears you shed before This is a remix of the same fears you shared
before I thought that they made it clear- (and they did) Our sound is not welcomed here (You should know) This is the crush of
the year In our night-vision dreams, know what I mean? You see yourself where you should be
