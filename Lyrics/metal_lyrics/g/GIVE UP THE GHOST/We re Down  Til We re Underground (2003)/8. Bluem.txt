Lemme say that I know when I should be confessing I'm counting everything- my change and blessings Chemists cursed me imbalanced
I ran through the streets until my legs gave in "Hey, even without light, I could see that we were failures" And I am coming
clean of dreams that don't exist Oh God it's in the air when it should be safe between our hands "And love, even without light, I
could see that we would fail" Lemme say what I mean Lemme sleep on your floor Lemme learn to love Cuz I can feel my face sinking
through bruised bones, barely hiding my mind Failure facsination- I got a count on all I'll never have And I am dying to not give
up on this (and I confess, fixation is my fix) And I've been running around trying to find my home Twenty years on the run trying
to find my own (and I confess, a house is not a home) My head is red- My bones black and blue Fever burns- choke on words at the
thought of you (and I confess, fixation is my fix) Sing a song for the disenchanted Hum a hymn for the misdirected A little love
for sons and daughters Shadow sitting life in forgotten corners (and then) I fell hard over myself again I confess my love for
everything I woke up and needed sleep again I confess my love for everything With the music bleeding in my veins Goddamn the
yesterdays With the love for all there is to love We're who you're dreaming of With the music bleeding in my veins Goddamn the
yesterdays With the love for all there is to love You're who we're dreaming of I confess
