Stars lead the way home when the sidewalks ending And I don't recall why we are still pretending I turned myself in for crimes I
didn't committ I needed to feel truly innocent There was a song, and I forgot the name of it It seemed sincere and this is kinda
how it went "It's one of those night when you're not sure of who the real 'you' is anymore" Generations can do whatever they want
to It's midafternoon and I'll be leaving soon Saviors are few and far, between two parked cars headed for anywhere- because
anwhere is better than here And in the ride, I have become aware, I'm probably not going anywhere It's one of those nights when
you're not sure who the real 'you' is anymore I said that, "I would end myself, but I think too much about my family, you see?" I
need to see if I can breathe in a different world This is my swan-song to my criminal boys and girls And no one really loves as
sure as the sun does fall And a fact without no truth just isn't a fact at all I want out of here I need to find the stars but city
sky'd hidingthemas if we are ashamed of what we've ruined the words I wrote Stuttered the times I spoke I've never been to close
with love, life, trust, and faithI need out of here I need my head clear I know my voice isn't great, but at least it's sincere
We are so conditioned to fall It's sad the story of the year is still nothing at all
