Send my regards, see my new scars? I'm half-dead from all these love songs Intro to incoming end- sing the ones that make you
want to live The world is spinning 'round and 'round and we're just staring at the ground (It's only everything) It's been too
long since the last time we felt alive We're digging our own graves- We're damning our own prayers And these are songs the world
would sing, but they're too deaf for honesty And these are lives the world would lead but they're against injury Dance to the
misery of your life put to back beat Dance to the sound of everything you ever lost- never had nothing at all I wouldn't be here
if I never plugged into this outlet There is a world waiting for us to live in it (viva love) Sing everything you ever loved, for
eveything you will one day love Long live the sound of desperation Long live the stereo destruction
