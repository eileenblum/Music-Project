Our love is all the we ever had Our love is all that we'll ever have Boys and girls, guys and dolls You were finding faith in
bathroom stalls And broken beds spring fractured spines Fall for the right kids all at the wrong times And in a world of sluts we
keep the wet dream alive Yea, our daught is drying out You go nowhere in a nowhere town and no one's listening to the sound of
breaking down and breaking out is just wishful thinking We're taking walks around the hearts and homes we'll never own You go
nowhere in a nowhere town and no one's listening to the sound of breaking down and breaking out is just wishful thinking You go
nowhere in a nowhere town We're growing up by falling down We love the songs because we live the songs in condemned flats between
rights and wrongs And all we know is that we'll never know We love the hearts but the hearts love us even more (Keep loving. Keep
brething. Keep living.) Desperate and true- Thinking of you Borrowed and blue- Sinking with you
