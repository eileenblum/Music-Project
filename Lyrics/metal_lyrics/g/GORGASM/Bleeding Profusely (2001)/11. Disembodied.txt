I stare at their dead faces
Behind a bloody rotten human mask
Like Lambs to the slaughter
I lured them to their doom
Deceived by my intentions
To fuck them like no other has before
Handcuffed to the bedposts
Then gagged and vivisected

Breasts loped off to admire
Mastectomies done with a wire
Emasculated victims
Sodomized with their own cocks
Disembodied genitalia
Trophies of my sick deeds

Carving off the flaps of skin
Which appeal most to me
Stapling their flesh to mine
Assuming their identity

Knocked unconscious to molest
I undress them of their flesh
Razor blades excoriate
Bleeding as I masturbate
Encase myself within their skin
Feminine or masculine
My only need is to consume them
I'm a demon dressed as human

Kicking and screaming
Begging and pleading
Their pitiful cries I despise
Destined to be a part of me
Until their flesh rots from mine
Now that I have them they cannot fathom
The cruel ways in which they will die
Slashed and molested
Raped and dissected
Genital organs enshrined

Victims lobotomized
I've skinned and sodomized
Cadavers swarm with flies
Horrifying demise
