Naked bedridden bloated gluttonous pig
Stagnant and swelling festering sack of pus
Engulfed in mounds of fetid flabby mass
Stinking behemoth, gross abdominous

Massive tits sagging growing out your back
Folds of skin hanging rolls of dimpled cheese
Each crevice reeks like crack of dirty ass
Starving as you gorge yourself with tons of food
Oblivious it's actually swallowing-YOU!

Prey on others sympathy to bring you food to stuff your face 'til you're 
full
Like some fucking fleshy fat balloon
Your body expanding day by day
Lying in your piss and shit
Your arms too short to wipe you own soiled ass
Crippled by your appetite
You're at my mercy, you'll soon see I have none

Slashed and spilled from your bladderous husk
Buckets of red cottage cheese for me to force feed you
Every last chunk of your fat, and I'll make certain of that
Quenching you hunger and thirst, stuffed 'til your fucking colon bursts!
