Deep within a ruptured vessel, putridity has come to life
Growing in a stagnant stench, visceral discharge is corroding
Pushing forward through the skin, blood and fluids running down
Former bone now becoming, liquid rancid fecal stench
Nerve endings explode in pain, life expectancy falls away
Realize you're close to death, collapsed lungs cannot draw your breath
I'm a sexual deviant, I 69 the dead
I caress her rotted corpse, as I fuck her lifeless head
Cock is covered dripping bile, draining fluid into jars
Tendons snap as limbs are broken, your screams of pain are slowly dying
Redefining living being, ravaged by this disease
Puncture wounds never becoming scar tissue as I
Revive the corpse for fucking, decomposed to my liking.
Drained of all your blood for my sanguine lust
Slave to my cruel religion
Slipping away, fetish for pain
Probing the rot, lusting your cunt
Sexual bloodlust feasting on my thoughts
Gangrenous formations from arterial recession
Skin becoming obsolete, vocal cords cut, you try to scream
Almost can't hold back the vomit clenching my teeth
Stench of rancid cunt that I must eat
Clitoris, gnawed and slowly torn
