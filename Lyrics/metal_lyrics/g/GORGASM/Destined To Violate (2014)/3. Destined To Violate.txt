Wounded headless bleeding, my next victim
Another whore to cut down with my fucking knife
Twisting innards decayed, flesh is rotting
Crushing human form, deteriorating, massive bloodflow
Bone shards penetrating through the skin
Lost and bleeding, pleading for her life
Pain leads to unconscious state of dying
Defecating. Bowels seeping rectal fluid
Taking pleasure in my acts of torture
Repulsive slayings. Inserting needles through the wounds
I relish the taste of annihilated flesh
Tongue inside your leaky crack
Breath caught in her throat, on my sack she will choke
Crushing skulls caving in, bleeding from the eyes
Eviscerate with no remorse, re-infectious maimed
Forlorn, forsaken, I don't care
Derisive torture consuming the blinded subject
Set forth to wander in my delightful torment
Lust for vengeance taking hold, no reprieve of violence now
Disgraced foul rejection fuels my violent contempt
Racing thoughts turn to madness, swallowing your teeth and cum
Muscle tissue torn away, butchering your horny flesh
