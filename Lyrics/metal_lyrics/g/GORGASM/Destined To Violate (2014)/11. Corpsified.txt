Forcibly sodomized, kept alive to have as my own
Necrosexual disfunctioning drone
Fucking their souls into the unknown
Peel the maggots from my skin, cum in the form of larvae
Fuck-fucking you from within
Rip-ripping you til you die
Twisting off dismembering genitals, put them now where skin used to be
I get aroused to see the blood, cum on you lastly as you bleed
Bones you've lost, stick them up, fuck yourself till you bleed
Out your ass, it shall pass, blood smeared shit and my seed
Peel the maggots from my skin, cum in the form of larvae
Fucking you from within, ripping you til you die
Indulge in the pleasure of seeing you die
Forging your carcass from the last bit of life
Come to me and eat my flesh, bring me life and I'll bring you death
Unconsciousness moves made by hate, erotic insertion severe life by the blade
Suffering knowing your life won't last
Struggling for it to pass away, corpsified
She'll be suffering the rest of her life
I'll be there while you're struggling to die
Keep her alive, forever young, to be killed, raped, and left to rot.
