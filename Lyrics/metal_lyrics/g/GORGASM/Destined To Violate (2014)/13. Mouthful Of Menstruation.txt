Strapping her down, spreading her legs, tear off her clothes
Frantically searching for means of escape
Presenting my knife, brings a look of dismay, tasting her flesh
Bury my face in her warm dripping cunt!
Fondling her lips, tickling her clitoris
Plunge deep in her open gash
Feel it start to drip, juice begins to seep
Just one lick the taste seems so familiar to me
Damp and dark, the moisture spreads
Down her thighs, now dripping red
Wipe my chin with certainty
Hands confirming my suspicion
Pull the string out with my teeth
Smile smeared with her menstruation
Ravage her cavity
Obsession consumes me
A taste like no other, I must have another
Sickness is my disease.
