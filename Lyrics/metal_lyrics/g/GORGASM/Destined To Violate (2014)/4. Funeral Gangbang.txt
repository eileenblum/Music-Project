Locking up the doors, shades drawn tight
Dimming the lights, patrons line up inside
Soon to reveal, this night's feature fuck
Lying in wait, open the casket lid
Let it begin, sick festivity
Nine swinging cocks, seeking their nourishment
Dragging out the prize, from her pine box
Tearing off her dress, one by one, she'll be done
Fill each hole, stuffed til full, funeral fuck fest begins
Cold and tight, I slip inside, lubed just right
Leaks formaldehyde, pussy almost feels alive, never felt this satisfied
Jerk and squirt, down her throat, dismal gaze
Dead eyes stalking me, awkwardly as climax is reached
Swarming like vultures the sickness is spreading
Bring out another to gorge our hunger for the dead
Eating her cold dead cunt my cock's stiff as the dead
Tasting her rot, gang rape the corpse, dead and defiled we leave our victims slight
