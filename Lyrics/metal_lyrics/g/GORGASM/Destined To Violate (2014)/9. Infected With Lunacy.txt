Murderous brutal rampage
Crippled and crushed, bones protrude in jagged arrangements
Swarming with flies, blood and shit splattered canvas
Flesh sagging sack, face is non-existent
Bury my face into your bloody stool
Munching on chunks as I contemplate loss of lucidity
Jamming my cock into the nest
Of maggots spewing from the abscess
Ballsack repeatedly
Slapping her sloppy hole increasing
Cunt detriment
As I impale her with my fist
Caked in atrophy
Flavor filled pustules now begin to seep
Tear through her flesh, covered in red I now put her to rest
Feeling inside, twisting and tearing the organs she hides
Rip off her flesh, fucking her skinless body is the best
Grind up the rest, I will devour until nothing's left
