Chain and secure the chapel doors.
Axe in hand I stand Before the
congregation. Figure of Iniquity
Scourge of the Christians I impose
my will. Orgy of murder I'm driven
to kill. Hacking my way through the
herd. The meek inherit my wrath.
Headless bodies convulsing. Limbs
decorate the pews. Twitching victims.
Covered in entrails. Raping survivors.
Drunk on the blood of Christ.
