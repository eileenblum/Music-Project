Bodies rotting. Decomposing
flesh falling From bone. Suffering
alone sickened by the sight Of
vile perversions. Waiting for what
lies in store. Losing your mind as I
step inside. Before you realize I've
already begun the process. Your
limbs quickly reduced to stumps.
Evacuation of your bowels provokes
demented laughter. Your shit
floats in a pool of blood. Heed the
hatchet splits the bone. Torture for
amusement. Sick absurdity. Silence
follows dismembering. Excitement
subsides Until the next offering.
