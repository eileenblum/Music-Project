Chloroform works good, much better than I expected.
Lie there nice and still while I prepare you for my need.
Unconsciously you choke, cock plunged deep inside throat.
Teeth are extracted. I get harder when you bleed. Hands gripped to the 
chair. Smell of fear is in the air.
Fingernails embedded, raked from the last before you.
Dehumanized and beaten. Cunt-lips half devoured, eaten.
Vile seductions reign. Propped up slumped in blood.

Writhe in my descent, feel every bone crack inside of your body.
I won't feel content until I see what's inside
your pain I intend. Feel my insertion.
Captive torment. I won't extend any emotion.
Sired repulsion. Concubine of Despise.

Peel your cunt lips open, blood and cum drip down your thighs.
Depending on my mood I won't make you suffer long. Try to fight to free your 
life.
Soon you'll be embalmed.
I can't let you die just yet.
You are my amusement.
My sadistic rapture, violently entrapped, I am faithful to each scream.
Inseminated cur just another breeder.
Bleed to live, live to bleed.

Cock in hand ideas begin to fornicate.
A grimacing stare frowning down I masturbate.
Acting on my impulse, gouging out your eye.
A stiff cock hard and ready. Shoved in nice and tightly, squirming, 
fighting, twitching, masticate.
Grimly deformed.
Sink my shaft in.
deeper  I dig my tool. Pupils start to dialate. Mouth a gasp for air.
Another hole to violate, and fill.
Deep within her full of dung.
Emptying out my sack.
Covering her with rotted cum.
Gargle up my stew.
Savor down each loving chunk.
Shifting in your mouth.
Wire your jaw nicely shut.
