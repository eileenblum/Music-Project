Fetish for horror, brought them to me.
Frenzied and impaled,
All the blood is sickening.
Hands soaked with vomit. Torture is my need.
Punctured and murdered.
From their screams upon I feed.
Enraptured, by my capture.
Purged and probed, one last fuck.

Anal skewer, frozen in your misery.
I procure, killing is my tendency.
Lie and wait-for what I'm going to do to you.
Wretched in pain for all the deeds I'll put you through.
Blood will spill-taking life so easily.
Make you still-dying death so violently.
Sodomy-engorging assholes with my shaft.
Impatiently-I'll await your final breath.

Strapped the bodies gored besides me.
Twitching, pulsate, writhing, fighting,
Violating, penetrating!
Bludgeoned disfigured holes remaining.

Fetish for horror, brought them to me.
Frenzied and impaled
All the blood is sickening.
Hands soaked with vomit.
Torture is my need.
Punctured and murdered.
From their screams upon I feed.
