Midnight looms, my eyes open The graveyard calls to me.
An abscessed Eden of putrid bodies.
Masturbating: as they rot with the creatures below.
I intend to victimize the entombed.
I won't stop 'till each body's been exhumed.
Searching for newly dead to excavate.
I'll display her rotting corpse in erotic state.

Open the coffin, VOMIT!
Spewing with excitement!
I undress the bodies. Erotica unearthed.

Morning dawns, relatives come to visit the deceased.
Traumatized, their loved ones posed on their graves with their genitalia 
exposed.

Memory of death instead of life forever remains.
