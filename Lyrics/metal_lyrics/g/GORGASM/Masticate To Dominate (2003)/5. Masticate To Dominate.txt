Twisting the knife-embedded in flesh.
Scarring daggers into the eyes.
Lust!!!
turned into rage, released as hate.
Slowly I cut straight to the bone.
Features contort distending in pain.
Scream if you like I find it exciting.
I will enjoy making you suffer again and again
Until your face goes blank!

Crushing appendages.
Torment excruciating.
Suffer!!!

Slumping in a heap,
lying there unconscious in a short lived purgatory.
Bleeding broken
Fastened tightly to the table. Voltage ripping through the body to revive 
with agony.
Brought back to hell!

Suffer!!!

Watching the knife gush from the flesh.
Staring into your dying eyes.
Lust !!!!
Turned into rage, released as hate.
Slashing the knife across your throat
drowning in blood gasping for air
seeing you die I find exciting.
I have enjoyed making you suffer until the end:

The end of your fucking life!
