You see thereâs something that Iâve held inside too long
But thereâs no room for any doubt at all in here
Repeating their words oh hold your head up high
Just so I can bring it all down and out

Sorry to say your show is over
Sorry to say youâre just like them alright
Your little hardheaded mind and your eyes are that blind
You pick wisely who you mess up this time
Come on so letâs just move on out of here

Youâre an extension of your little narrow minds
And all the missionary work youâve left behind
Theyâre still holding your strings oh youâre dancing so fine
Pretty little rebel yeah you live just to die

Sorry to say your show is over
Sorry to say youâre just like them alright
Your little hardheaded mind and your eyes are that blind
You pick wisely who you mess up this time
Come on so letâs just move on out of here

Leaving so precious and so right
Maybe one day you will be fine
Taking it home will leave them no trace
To fall is what you need to pay it back

So letâs just move on out of here

Sorry to say your show is over
Sorry to say youâre just like them alright
Your little hardheaded mind and your eyes are that blind
You pick wisely who you mess up this time
Come on so letâs just move on out of here
