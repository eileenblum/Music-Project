I remember the days I donât recall
It was a time of innocence and decadence
Oh the fights, the fun and the ignorance
Now youâre always under influence

A long hard fall from oblivion
The apple doesnât fall far from the tree
Too young and scared to let it be you and me
Too full of ourselves to see how it was gonna be

Never had an easy living but itâs the only life youâve ever known
Youâve been good youâve been bad youâve been different
Thatâs how it goes for people like me and you

Ainât it strange how the cards are dealt?
You say tomorrow seems as bad as yesterday
That you live because you have to not because you wanna stay
Then thereâs those who die trying to get away

Never had an easy living but itâs the only life youâve ever known
Youâve been good youâve been bad youâve been different
Thatâs how it goes for people like me and you

So sick of people telling us who we are
Iâm neither or Iâm everything and in between
Iâm nothing or something that youâve never ever seen
Lifeâs a repetition how itâs always been

Never had an easy living but itâs the only life youâve ever known
Youâve been good youâve been bad youâve been different
Thatâs how it goes for people like me and you
