Can you hear a big bird singing somewhere in the back of your mind
Itâs loud enough to make you wonder
Can I please hear it one more time

Saying Iâll never leave you
Call me and Iâm on my way
Somehow I can always see you
And I can feel you in me everyday

You say you travel on a winding road
Itâs long enough to wrap you up
How can you tell if itâs real
The way it touches is sure hard to feel

Too much of nothing can hurt you
And too little hurt even worse
I wonder if Iâll ever get to you
Or if youâll have to get to me first

Into the street of the city
Where we donât have to think so hard
And we donât have to worry now do we
Just look at the world from a hole in the wall

While on your way to see a troubled friend
You loose your way and never see her again
I think I know how it feels
The way it touches is sure hard to feel

Too much of nothing can hurt you
And too little hurt even worse
I wonder if Iâll ever get to you
Or if youâll have to get to me first

Into the street of the city
Where we donât have to think so hard
And we donât have to worry now do we
Just look at the world from a hole in the wall

Look and see a sky is forming
Holding so many rains
It makes you feel real lonely
And the feeling is like a ball and chain

Down on the street of the city
Where you donât have to think so hard
And you donât have to worry now do you
Just look at the world from a hole in the wall

You put in the back of your head now
Save it for another time
And when it gets too heavy to carry
You may always put it down on mine

I promise Iâll never leave you
Call me and Iâm on my way
Somehow I can always see you
