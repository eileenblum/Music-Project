It was never never, ever never theirs to take and never theirs to sell

Did you notice when they stole your life?
And that the price never reveals the cost?
Trapped in labor trained to stay in line
What are they doing with whatâs yours and mine

It was never ever, never never theirs to take
It was never ever, never never theirs to take
And never theirs to sell

Four hundred years and weâre still going strong
One way bridges and apartheid walls
Same old bullshit with a different name
Canât call it playing âcause itâs a fixed game

Can your hear that old song stuck on repeat?
Familiar problems never cease to exist
Self-righteous men with a broken will
Strong minded women always pay those bills

It was never ever, never never theirs to take
It was never ever, never never theirs to take
And never theirs to sell
