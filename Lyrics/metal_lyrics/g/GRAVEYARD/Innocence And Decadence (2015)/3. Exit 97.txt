Just as the sun slowly catches the ground she walks by
They walk with me through darkness and cold-hearted minds
In this dream and on this ride you are mine
Oh havenât you seen they shine brighter than stars in the sky

No one
No one
No one else can make me go

If nothing is real they havenât seen this one
And the wound of the spear two chosen ones
âTil the end

Some say itâs few to find love to be true words inside
The winter still comes but your vision will lead to the light
Out from me and in to you everything grows strong
All that Iâve got might not be that much but Iâm giving it all to you

You are the one
And I will give it all to you

If nothing is real they havenât seen this one
And the wound of the spear two chosen ones
âTil the end
