Baby your mindâs already made up
You just donât know it yet
Or maybe youâre just letting me down easy
I know you tried, tried to keep us together
But in the end there was nothing left to keep

I said, I said that I love you and I always will
Now that would have been true if only time stood still

It was too little too late and now too much is not enough
I know we got it wrong I did too little too late
Someday youâll see the shades of grey
So baby please donât let your love turn to hate

Now summerâs here but my baby ainât
I never got the chance to say donât go
Because you were already long gone by then
Uncertainty had me in a chokehold
And all I could think to say was so far from right
It made the wrong words seem like poetry

Honey I hope you realize,
Being persuasive doesnât always make you right
I know we got it wrong, I did too little too late
Someday youâll see the shades of grey
So baby please donât let your love turn to hate
