It was a light rain that fell
It fell heavy on our heads that day
Benny wasnât even there to see it go down
Maybe he knew they wouldnât let him stay

Itâs cause and defect

We all saw the dark clouds coming
Thatâs when he painted the basement blue
He stepped right out took a step closer to dying
Two steps more without even trying

Itâs cause and defect

Itâs like climbing a dream
Tumbling down a failure
Trippinâ on a nightmare
To see that no one is there no one is there

No matter no matter their motives
The consequences are the same
Predictable systems with no one to blame
Wisdom of experience nowhere to be found

Itâs like climbing a dream
Tumbling down a failure
Trippinâ on a nightmare
To see that no one is there no one is there
