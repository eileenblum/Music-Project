I might not be much to look at and I might not have much to say
But if you let me love you baby thereâs a good chance youâre gonna stay
Smooth talking, dancing and bragging honey itâs never been my thing
Maybe my voice can give you comfort if you stick around to hear me sing

Wonât you stay for a song
Wonât you stay one more song
Wonât you stay one more song

My place among all lovers it sure ainât number one
Although I am good enough for you to miss me when Iâm gone
On stage when I face a crowd of people inside I still feel alone
But I know Iâm a decent singer and most days I can keep my tone

Wonât you stay one more song
Wonât you stay one more song
Wonât you stay one more song
