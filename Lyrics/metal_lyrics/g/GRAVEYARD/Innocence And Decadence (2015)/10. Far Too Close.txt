I could feel it all that day and how life just ran away
Somehow they got you and almost took what they need
I heard the bells were ringing and darkness growing from the pain

And if you leave where would you go
Cause I will follow, slowly Iâm making my way

How I keep on wondering Iâve looked for reasons but they fail
I keep on wondering what have we done to let it fade

Never seen the colors fade so fast and for time to move so slow
I hear them riding in the wind like a shadow of my sin
This time youâre wrong but the fear makes you forget
You know I wish I was closer but Iâm a million miles away

An endless night to come and sides so steep and the fall is far too close
For the one and all I know, Iâll see them from above with you
