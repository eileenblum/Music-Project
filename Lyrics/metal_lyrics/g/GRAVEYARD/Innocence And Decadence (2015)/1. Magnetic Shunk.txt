Youâre a magnet to my mind baby donât know what to do
But I would plow through shame to sit right next to you
Itâs nobodyâs business who you give your kiss
But Iâm telling all the world what theyâre about to miss

I know youâve done a lot of loving before you did me
But I could never guess how sweet it would be
Practice makes perfect now ainât that true
So get ready honey now Iâm gonna do you

Nothing feels better than your skin on my skin
Donât care about the others or where youâve been
I can play dirty and I know you play rough
One, two, three, four shakes is never enough

I know youâve done a lot of loving before you did me
But I could never guess how sweet it would be
Practice makes perfect now ainât that true
So get ready honey now Iâm gonna do you

When you walk into a room floating across the floor
I get awestruck I get dumb an easy prey a sitting duck
When you lay your eyes on me with that smile on your face
I wanna feel your touch again oh I canât wait until weâ¦

No need to be gently baby I like it raw
Treat me like I was crime and you are the law

Bite me spank me baby pull my hair
Iâm gonna rub you the right way and kiss you right there

I know youâve done a lot of loving before you did me
But I could never guess how sweet it would be
Practice makes perfect now ainât that true
So get ready honey now Iâm gonna do you
