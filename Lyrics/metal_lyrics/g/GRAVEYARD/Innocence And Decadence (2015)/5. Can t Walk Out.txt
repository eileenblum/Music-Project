We saw you try to walk out on yourself
Walk out on what you had become
We saw you walk out on the universe
Walk out on the world until it came around
Walk, walk, walk, walk out on your self

You saw us sit down to drink your wine
Saw you dance through life âtill your music died
Dance, dance, dance âtill your music died
Dance, dance, dance âtill your music died

Waiting for shazam

But you canât walk out on the universe
Gotta keep dancing when your music dies
No you canât walk out on the universe
Gotta keep dancing when your music dies

Watch out here it comes â Shazam
Here it comes â Shazam Shazam Shazam
Shazam

What is a true urge and what have we been taught?
Pushed reality aside to live your truth
What was it that never let them pin you down?
You pushed determination down their throats

Push, push, push, reality aside
Freak, freak, freak, freak them out and sing

But you canât walk out on the universe
Gotta keep dancing when your music dies
No you canât walk out on the universe
Gotta keep dancing when your music dies
