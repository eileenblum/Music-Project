I've been alive and I've been dead
There is something wrong with my head
Laughing in this curse called life
No longer makes any sense

There's a hole in my soul
That cannot be filled
God knows that I've tried
And blood has been spilled

I've sold my soul for a bottle of gin
And traded for a pack of smokes
Your evil ways has conquered me
And I know there is no turning back

There's a hole in my soul
That cannot be filled
God knows that I've tried
And blood has been spilled

Have you seen
Life through my eyes
Then you'll change
Your point of view

I've been to the bottom and I pointed down
Never gonna look up again

This is no way to be ...
Don't care what it's doing to me
So one of these ...
I've just begun my search

This is no way to be ...
Don't care what it's doing to me
So one of these ...
I've just begun my search

This is no way to be ...
Don't care what it's doing to me
So one of these ...
I've just begun my search
