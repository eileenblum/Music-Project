Years pass by,
the hours bend
I am deeply inside myself, and I'm
moving and thinking again

Of all the people,
Of days gone by, forgotten times
Of all the people,
all round me moving slowly and laughing and crying

Living and dying is easy,
when time fades away
The people of tomorrow
are the children of today
Can't be denied, no
Can't be denied, no
It can't be denied, no
It can't be denied

Slow hand's folding
Move the mind
The children growing
faster, a sign of the time

A sign of the time,
the reason to ask where I am
Got a halo of gold and a black cloud
and I believe that I am stuck in this place where I stand

Living and dying is easy,
when time fades away
The people of tomorrow
are the children of today
It can't be denied, no
It can't be denied, no
It can't be denied, no
It can't be denied, no
Can't be denied
Can't be denied, no
Can't be denied
Can't be denied, no
