There are three things
That leads to pain
I think that Belial
Has started his reign

The first one is booze
Your life it drains
Takes you to prison
Criminally insane

Satan's finest
Well, that's for sure
Making you want them
And begging for more

The second is money
Makes the world turn on end
The rich men are leaders
The poor, they can starve

The worst one is women
They must be Hell-sent
Tearing your soul out
And makes you drink more

Satan's finest
Well, that's for sure
Making you want them
And begging for more

God in Heaven; the shepherd above
Will die in his grave
Satan is smiling
Your soul he will save

His kingdom is filled
With those who believe
The meaning of life
Is one of those three

Satan's finest
Well, that's for sure
Making you want them
And begging for more

Satan's finest
Well, that's for sure
Making you want them
And begging for more

Making you want them
And begging for more

Satan's finest
Well, that's for sure
Making you want them
And begging for more
