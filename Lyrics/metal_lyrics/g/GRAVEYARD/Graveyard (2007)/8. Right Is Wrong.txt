Turn the page
And tear the new off

Please, let me tell you
There are two ways to go
The first is the wrong one
And the last path you'll see
Makes you fall deeper
In hell you'll soon be
Forbidden fruits gonna taste better

Right is wrong
Whatever you choose, one side of you'll lose
Your ancient soul
Walking down a two seam path
Because you choose right

Choose the right way
If salvation you seek
And if you would die
The good lord you'll meet
And come to heaven and then you'll
Be surrounded by love
You know it seems like the right road
Well, I don't agree

I don't cling when you are blessed
Thinking you're holy, when you are possessed
I need your peace when you're in charge
Condemn the breeze when your soul is cursed

Right is wrong
Whatever you choose, one side of you'll lose
Your ancient soul
Walking down a two seam path
Because you choose right

Whichever you choose
My friend, one thing you'll learn
That life is full of
Right and left turns
When you decide you only make things worse
Discover the pattern that's written enough
Follow your heart, and continue your search

I don't cling when you are blessed
Thinking holy, when you are possessed
I need your peace when you're in charge
Condemn the breeze when your soul is cursed

I don't cling when you are blessed
Thinking holy, when you are possessed
I need your peace when you're in charge
Condemn the breeze when your soul is cursed
