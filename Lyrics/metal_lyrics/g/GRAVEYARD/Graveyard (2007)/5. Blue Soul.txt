I believe my time ain't long
I got a feeling I am going wrong
And if u see me coming round
You know my words will only bring you down
Blue is the color of my soul
Bad times breaking up my lifeline
Now my days are overcast and
I can seem to find my way off of this lonely road

And i believe that before too long
all my sorrows will be overcome
I don't know but i've been told
You ain't worth much
when you're blood is cold

Blue is the color of my soul
bad times breaking up my life line
now my days are overcast
and i can seem to find my way
off of this lonely road. no!

well have you heard the screams
of a thousand dead
the reaper wispers in your ears when you're falling dead
one more day and i'm dragging on
i touch the people that i welcome home
tears falling from my heavy eye
snow's falling from my yellow sky
one more day and i ask my self
how long how long before I do pass on?

red sun burn my eyes
white vision arise from the yellow side
blue is the color of my soul
and i can seem to find my way off of this lonely road no!

red sun burn my eyes as i wake up
blue soul bad times breaking up my lifeline
red sun burn my eyes as i wake up
blue soul bad times breaking up my lifeline
