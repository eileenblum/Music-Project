Do you recall all the first ones
turning to smoke and 6 was 9
we loved it then and we love it now
but you are walkin' on that thin line

This time it's all up to you
we all know you're on the fast track
you turned the wrong step years ago
into a deadly parasite

You're so awake that you can't see
still trying to believe that you are free
killin' yourself and the ones you love
only one thing left for you to do...

When you stumbled and fell
we were there and had your back
everyone knows that you know it well
gotta get off that thin line

This time it's all up to you
we all know you're on the fast track
you turned the wrong step years ago
into a deadly parasite

You're so awake that you can't see
still trying to believe that you are free
killin' yourself and the ones you love
only one thing left for you to do...

When i feel good I'm movin' slow
you aughtta try to change the pace
i know your flame needs air to burn
so you should stop and take a breath
or else your life will end

I like to let my head fly
but i don't let it eat my mind
don't let the speed of life blind your eyes
slow down and start feeling fine
if you don't quit you'll surely die
get off that thin line

Got no excuses left to you
feel like runnin' away from yourself
so beat so tired am having to lose
only thing is to get off that thin line

This time it's all up to you
we all know you're on the fast track
you turned the wrong step years ago
into a deadly parasite

You're so awake that you can't see
still trying to believe that you are free
killin' yourself and the ones you love
only one thing left for you to do...
