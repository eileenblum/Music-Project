When the sky if falling and the earth is burning
Just want to close it off and blot out the sun

Goodbye autumn wind,
Say hello to spring breeze

Sweet momento of the river, but water gets deeper
I'm feeling the stream but it's dragging me in

I'm sucking what whirlpool
Going round and down

Give me a blind man's eye,
And I'll count all the stars in the sky
Drink the hangman's wine,
to cross that river of mine

My powers are weakening, sicking through that hole
I'm rumbling and tumbling while I stop downstream

But I know a plan,
yes I know the way

Give me a blind man's eye,
And I'll count all the stars in the sky
Drink the hangman's wine,
to cross that river of mine
