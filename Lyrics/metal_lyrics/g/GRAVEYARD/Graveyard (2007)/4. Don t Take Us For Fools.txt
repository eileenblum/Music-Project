Distracting our minds
Make our life feel worthwile
Changing our ways
And make us feel less
Cause you are using your brains
And you're using our arms
Make us lose our sense in useless things

Money for reason, is not in your head
More isn't enough, just gaining wealth
We're calling you treason
You make use feel ...
You think we're just glad, oh, having our health

Sometimes, we got to get up
And break down that system that's keeping us down

Play that god, that we all should serve
Your goal is our souls and it's tearing up holes
Why is there no-one, stopping your madness?
Try to get away, when we open our eyes

Sometimes, we got to get up
And break down that system that's keeping us down

Sometimes, we got to wake up
And realise that this isn't right

What makes you think that you have the right
To impoverish the sun that we all should share
Because the ones, who were the first
To put up fences and claim land for their own

Sometimes, we got to get up
And break down that system that's keeping us down

Sometimes, we got to get up
And realise that this isn't right

You take us for fools
But one thing you'll see
'Cause the way that you rule
Is just tyranny

You take us for fools

All the .. that you lost
Civilisation ends
The bastard's creed
It's just tyranny
Just rise and say no
To the one ...
And take all the wealth
