Buried in darkness again,
Free from the thoughts of you
Had happiness within my reach,
But as usual I threw it away

Seeking the answers below,
On the bottom, everyone knows
That life is for the living
But today I'm not one of them

Turn around and walk away,
Listen closely to what I say
Have you seen what I have seen?
Have you been where I have been?
My path that leads to hell

The worm inside my chest,
That's feeding on my pain,
Has lived there for many years now
Since the day that innocence died!

Turn around and walk away,
Listen closely to what I say
Have you seen what I have seen?
Have you been where I have been?
Down the path that leads to hell
I cease to begin

One thing I know,
that in your time you're getting tired of your peace of mind
Rise up again,
no time to pretend that actually I'm one of them

The ungrateful are the dead,
Though they rest in peace
But I am the living dead
Oh God, give me rest
