New Day when beauty's all gone.
And blues follows a lifeless prowl
My traveled mind spins way too far
My whining head is impossible to hold
My eyes are dead the dub ice cold
The spies are all gone
Suddenly the sky is clear but so hard to feel
Quiet hatred blows my mind as everything around me all breaks down
As they watch by the fires a reality you a

Change is all I want but I can't do it all
When the crystal world can the darkness call?
No I'm no good you're no god
When you do tear down my fences to fall
New day now they're breaking my wall
I'm building an army for my mental wall
Just give me your mind your head and your soul
Give me your sun and show me your moon
One step closer they will sigh
Your future with the past
Heads may go so we can choose before they take you out
In shallow truth and hate your days go by
Experiments in lies
We're all in line to step aside till you stick to their plan

They say you're insane so don't say a word
If it has a name, it has no trace
The dust makes things red
The life that you lived will never come back
And there's nothing easy so hit with the rain

They say you're insane so don't say a word
If it has a name, it has no trace
The travelled mind is all about freedom
The dust that you breathe makes everything red
Life that your lived will never come back
And there's nothing easy
So hit with the rain

Change is... But I can do it all
When the crystal world can the darkness call
No I'm no good you're no god
When you do tear down my fences to fall
No I'm no good you're no god
When you do tear down my fences to fall
