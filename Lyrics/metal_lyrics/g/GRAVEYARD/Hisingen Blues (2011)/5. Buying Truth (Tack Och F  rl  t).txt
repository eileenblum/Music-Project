You lost your touch and it ain't no fun
You lost your job, now you're acting dumb

There's no doubt about it, you're a shadow of your past
You created nothing, nothing that will last
I said, I know your tricks
You won't get me hooked

When was the last time that you felt alive
Did you forget how to hand out the lies?
In your world they're buying truth
... below even though out for real

Ain't got much, but you think you're tough
I said, I liked you when I didn't know you well
Glory days are over, yeah, you had your time
Broke, you're left with nothing, nothing but a dime

When was the last time that you felt alive
Did you forget how to hand out the lies?
In your world they're buying truth
... below even though out for real

I see through you, you're like an open book
I know your tricks, you won't get me hooked
Don't ask me for forgiveness, it ain't no use
I'm gonna hunt you down, yeah, you're bound to know
You're bound to know

When was the last time that you felt alive
Did you forget how to hand out the lies?
In your world they're buying truth
... below even though out for real
