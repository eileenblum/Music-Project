Standing at the base of the pyramid
But itâs never gonna meet the end.
Youâre not supposed to know that it exists,
When nothing set us, nothing do deny.

If you leave your place in the fond days
To see the castles made of sand.
Watch it fall into the sea or either way
And you donât see how youâre feeling okay.

Your suits, the law, the uniforms,
They agree on the same patrons.

Time is what you got,
So do you know who youâre standing on
When they say itâs cheap, thatâs how hard it goes
And cause the swipe of the game it suppose.

Your suits, the law, the uniforms,
They agree on the same patrons.
You know that life was made for so much more than this
More you wait, the more lose life control.

Oh, I donât want your job,
No, I wonât live your life,
No, I wonât live your life.
So I wonât live for you
No, I ainât got a boat,
No, I ainât got a boat.

I see yourselves tonight, Iâll understand
What it is that makes a man.
When I hear them say that the lots you own
I hear insistence to broke your mouths.

If we can make it through the uny,
The worldâll become a jungle in doubt.
Itâs the suits, the law, the uniforms bringing grieve on the sand patrol.
You know that life was made for someone more than this,
More than wait is profit and control.

Oh, I donât want your job,
No, I wonât live your life,
No, I wonât live your life.
So I wonât live for you
No, I ainât got a boat,
No, I ainât got a boat.

Itâs the suits, the law, the uniforms bringing grieve on the sand patrol.
You know that life was made for someone more than this,
More than wait is profit and control.

Itâs the suits, the law, the uniforms bringing grieve on the sand patrol.
You know that life was made for someone more than this,
More than wait is profit and control.
