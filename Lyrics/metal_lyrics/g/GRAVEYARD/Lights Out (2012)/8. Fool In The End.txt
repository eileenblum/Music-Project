I remember when it hit me,
Couldnât see a way back.
The pedal of the story
The pressure and the thrill.

What can you expect when it all began
What did you think your music was to bring?

Feel like a need a thousand years and a lot of riot to all,
The time I spent in waiting is a lifetime in itself.

âcause so many fools now call you the friend,
I hopw you know that you are one of them.

Why did you think that you can have it all for free?
Could you see me, I was actual fun,
Did you think Iâll ever be an easy run?
Canât you see that youâre the fool in the end,
Youâre the fool in the end.

Itâs been right all my life,
You lend me something I chose.
I know that I once more really raised those blues.
Sometimes you should leave and you can let it be,
Itâs been a lot on my life, it ainât something I chose,
I got the restless blues, I got the restless blues.

Why did you think that you can have it all for free?
Could you see me, I was actual fun,
Did you think Iâll ever be an easy run?
Canât you see that youâre the fool in the end,
Youâre the fool in the end.
Why did you think that you can have it all for free?
Could you see me, I was actual fun,
Did you think Iâll ever be an easy run?
Canât you see that youâre the fool in the end,
Youâre the fool in the end.

Youâre the fool in the endâ¦
