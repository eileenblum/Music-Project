Shaking, aching, faking, trying to be on this
Admit it to myself, Iâve got nobody left to call a friend.
I wanna drink again.

Whining, dining, crying, lying, denying, burning all the chloroform.
Holding back my tears, I never felt like that long day.
I wanna drink again.

Ainât no light in my tunnel, but the gold tooth in the devilâs smile.
I walked a wide road a thousand times
It never led me anywhere.

Ainât no light in my tunnel, but the gold tooth in the devilâs smile.
I walked a wide road a thousand times
It never led me anywhere.

Loosing, bragging, losing, sleeping, sliding on to that embodied
No use to pretend, I see the reaper coming round the bend.
I wanna drink again.

Willing, dealing, stealing, cheating, beating, burning all my bridges.
I ainât got no pride, these turning hands got nothing to defend.
I wanna drink again.

I hear the lonesome sound of the guitar,
Itâs coming through the wind.
A bottle keeps on sliding, weeping out my blues,
I bring years with lands.

Ainât no light in my tunnel, but the gold tooth in the devilâs smile.
I walked a wide road a thousand times
It never led me anywhere.

I hear the lonesome sound of the guitar,
Itâs coming through the wind.
A bottle keeps on sliding, weeping out my blues,
I bring years with lands.
