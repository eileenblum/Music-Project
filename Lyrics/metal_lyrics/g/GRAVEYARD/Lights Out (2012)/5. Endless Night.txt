I see you right through the charade
No way Iâm going back again.
Give me a name for all thatâs bad
Seems to me itâs all Iâve got.

I was born to endless nights
Oh, my try, it leads in vain.
Some people think that Iâm the man
Because Iâve thrown away all that I had.

I donât think no one learns
So many tries have come to help.

I was born to endless nights
Oh, my try, it leads in vain.
Some people think that Iâm the man
Because Iâve thrown away all that I had.

One last try before things fail
With my luck Iâll end up in jail.
Iâm going to war, to war with myself
Putting my head, my head on the shelf.
Iâm losing our battles all over again
Iâm going to war, to war with myself.

I was born to endless nights
Oh, my try, is in vain.
Some people think that Iâm the man
Because Iâve thrown away all that I had.
