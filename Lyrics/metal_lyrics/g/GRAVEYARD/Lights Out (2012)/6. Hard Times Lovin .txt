Darling, Iâm leaving now,
But itâs only for a while.
It wonât seem so long once Iâm back into your arms.
Each night I go to bed
Wishing I was at home, next to you.

I know you wonder what I do when Iâm gone,
âcause, honey,
I know what you have heard
And I know what people say
And sure Iâve tasted fruit of many kind.
Once I had a piece of you
There was on me for nothing else.

Stay with me and see what tomorrow brings
âcause, baby, I know those days I let you down
Weâll make it through, through these hard times.

Oh, baby, you and me are the same,
Slightly used and damaged, thatâs okay.
I even think itâs good, no matter what they say
âcause they got you here today, right here with me.

It was something in your eyes
That made it clear.
I knew that he was right, not a shadow of doubt
When I felt your touch.

I know those days I let you down,
But weâre gonna get through these hard times
See what tomorrow brings,
Will you love me and stay with me forever?
The pieces came together,
The pointless random people have felt my last caress
No more faces passing by.

I know those days I let you down,
But weâre gonna get through these hard times
See what tomorrow brings,
Please love me, as they will live forever.
I got no need for no one else, no one else.

Once I got a piece of you, there was no need for nothing else,
No one else.
