How low, how long? Lower than the sea.
Too long to go, too far to even try to reach.
And donÂ´t you even try to let it go.
While everything around me is breaking down so slow.

Where will you go when we all fade away?
Where is your silver touch above the sun next to us?
So when you walk outside to see the reasons fall.
Do not forget the light that doesnÂ´t make you crawl.

But youâre staying home at just the saddest news
There is no side to chose.
And the numbers grow and push you down so low,
Youâll never let it loose, donât ever let it loose.

Oh, was it a low way down to leave us behind?
So stay where you are,
DonÂ´t come around no more.
But if it has gone too far
Iâve been asking for you
No, I won't to see you you call the way the others do
If these are your prayers I wonât follow you through.
When the flame turns blue not even you will lead us through.

ThatÂ´s why I never go if you see me I move slow.
My head runs off I spread the bad news where I go.
YouÂ´ll see the ones that lost theyÂ´re minds into their hole.
Like all your loved ones played the best part of their role.

I canÂ´t help you now, when you ask me how I see the trouble in your way.
If youÂ´re out of time you just stay in line donÂ´t ever let it loose.
DonÂ´t ever let it loose.

Oh, wasnÂ´t it a long way down, they leave us behind.
So stay where you are,
DonÂ´t come around no more.
But if it has gone too far
Iâve been asking for you
No, I won't to see you you call the way the others do
If these are your prayers I wonât follow you through.
When the flame turns blue not even you will lead us through.

DonÂ´t ever let it loose.
DonÂ´t ever let it loose.
Oh wasnÂ´t it a long way down.
Not even you will lead us through.
When the flame turns blue.
