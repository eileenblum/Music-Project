Into the tragedy that delights my heart with fire
And yours was there to die as I struck once again

With lightning so fierce I blew God's child away,
so I shed this blood and feast on the entrails

Within the wandering herd, sheep of the Sang Real,
we act as wolves with an hunger eternal

Feel a hunter draws near,
wants to scar that skin so dear.
Hear your scream escapes the woods,
where the soil stained red.
And the animals couldn't pity another death,
where trees hide my newest kill.
Ochone, see fair angels weep so long,
and rain made all the trails be gone

You cried my name into the distant horizon,
Where hope could not perceive
Your urge for lucky saviour.
Here your soul did flee and left your tiny life.
Here I digged your grave
It will embrace your body save... from the Sun
