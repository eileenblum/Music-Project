Shine as my wrath!
Knife of infinite kills
You belong to me
My hate is yours
Shine like no star ever signed
The grave of innocense
The ancient wrath
Of a soul thrown into the dark
Give me domination
In glory of blood and fire!
Give me strength by the Council of Chaos!
Spirits of the Ganzir Gate
Take this life to rise up high
So we may see earth fall
Deep into the pits of despair
Where life will merge in a black void eternal
