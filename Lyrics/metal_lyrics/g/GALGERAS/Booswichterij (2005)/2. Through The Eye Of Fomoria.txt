The chimes spoke stars in rusty winds
As the rider arrived at last our haven
One hand risen, one tend the horse
For warfare driven he shall set flame in our course.

Here we find chilly void
Ever since our fathers tamed the Lands of Lochlann
Here we hail Crom Crauch welcome
Death worldwide makes love begone

Here the Evil Eye signs our shields
And our swords so sharp wait for more kingdoms to conquer
Down with their banners, down with their heads
The Horde marches towards new bloodshed

Human, see the cold be our herald
And snow covering our trails
Where our ships have landed
The horizon is ablaze

Fire forged in the heat of destruction
Cries raped silence once and again
The followers of the earthwhore are dead or enslaved
The Land of Youth became the Land of Graves
