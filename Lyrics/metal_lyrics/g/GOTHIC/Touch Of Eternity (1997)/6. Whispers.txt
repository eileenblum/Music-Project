Standing in silence
Listening to the wind
It's a vision of a sad whispering
Which cries for the light
To blow away the shadows

I Whisper

The distant music of my sorrow
Is flowing like the wind
In the front of my eyes
My very blind eyes...

[Solo: Alin]

This was my first time
