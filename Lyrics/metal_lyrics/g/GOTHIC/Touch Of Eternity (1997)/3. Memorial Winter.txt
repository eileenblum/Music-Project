My brothers are dead
Here I am alone
I'm fighting, I'm proud
To worship the dirt...
My brothers, I praise you
There's nothing left for me
I won't haunt your shadows eternally...

Use your eyes instead of your fucking soul
Don't seek your deepest sides of dreams in trash
Honesty means cry
It feels so strong when you try to make an order

In a fake tomorrow
We'll be crossed souls again
I hope I'll see you happy
As we'll meet someday again
