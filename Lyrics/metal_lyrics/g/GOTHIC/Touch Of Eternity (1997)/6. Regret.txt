I, who am I?
In your eyes
Who am I?
Sky, a free sky
I will see
When I die

My tears - that no one sees
My prayers - that no one wants to hear
My thoughts - that no one knows
My pain - that no one wants to hear

Bloody prayer...

[Solo: Emil]

The happiness I never saw
The real joy I never heard
The love I never knew
The real life I never felt
