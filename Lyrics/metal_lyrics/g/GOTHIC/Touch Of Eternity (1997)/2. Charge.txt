If I support on broken dreams
When I feel the flowing hate
When aversion's not what it seems

And when the charged is the one who waits
In a world of frozen tears
Take away this cheated mirror

Becoming more than a man

Charge the wind
Charge the fire
Charge the sorrow

As the truth believes in lie
To avoid this endless search
To escape from fallen name
I'm settled down in peace
and I know it's time to leave
Drab and dirt I don't want to know you
