On the road to darkness
There's a roam that someone knows
Will it be showed?...
Like the deepest secret
You paint the rage in a coloured way
Your mask is afraid...

Hate - you want to come inside me
Hate - you think you'll set me free
Hate - you know I'll fight until
My last day will come

The voice of innocence is asking now:
Am I born just to die?
