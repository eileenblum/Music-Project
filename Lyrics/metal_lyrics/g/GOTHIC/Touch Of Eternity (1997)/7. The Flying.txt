Doesn't matter what I shall make
Whatever I'll try to break

Like a shadow
Inside of me
Is my lost soul
That always bleeds
Where's my brother?
Where's myself I used to love?
Scaring masks I see in me.

I'm flying away
I'm falling in my own thoughts
I'm erasing this game
I'm another one that goes away

I've heard the voices
Calling me in vain
Between the sun and misery
I don't believe in me again.
