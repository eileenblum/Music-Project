Forgotten in pain
By those who loved me once
I'm praying that just my silence
Will be heard
And I know that the time
Is my father...

I begin to accept the betrayal
As a primal sense of life
I want to run and hide
But I'm scared
Don't blame me for my pain
Forgive me for my hope.

Silence in my pain...
