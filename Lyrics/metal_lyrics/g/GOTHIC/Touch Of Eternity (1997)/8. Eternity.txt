[Alin:]
In my heart
In my soul
There's nothing right
But I'm pleased, my lord

[Cornel:]
I've paid enough to be so soothed

God, forgive me
For what I've done
My anguish cry
Means nothing else but none
Years of shadows
This is left behind
I'm independent
There is so much to find!...

My life, my fate
This is eternity
