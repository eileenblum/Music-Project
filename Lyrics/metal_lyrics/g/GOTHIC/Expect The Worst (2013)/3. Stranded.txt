[Music: Petrut, Lyrics: Petrut]

I stand beside my fellow mates
No fear, no tears, you`ll fell our hate
We`ll bring you down and you will die
Feel the blast from all our eyes
All is now within our grasp

For all the sorrow in this world
I`ll take my chance for what is worth
Final mission: terminate
We`ll haunt you ever in your dreams
Fantastic ghosts from outer realms
Eradicate your every trace !

Love and hate will fall apart
Something stranded in my heart
You let me down
Now you`re falling with no bond.

Welcome your fate
Infinite wait
