[Music: Petrut, Lyrics: Petrut, Klepsy]

There is no hope
In future times
In the unknown
I`ll close my eyes

Your wings were broken by your fears
Decayed from pagan thoughts - so clear
Fallen faith is what you need
From your past - your presence

No one can see what I`ve been through
My faith has turned its face from me
Been travelling on , I`ve reached the end
I`ll take my place out of this world
