[Music: Petrut, Lyrics: Petrut]

Gone forever - away from my sight
I see a window upon space and time
Like a shadow they took you far away
Falling teardrops on a rainy day

So many different faces
Once again pierce through my head
A thousand memories that now are dead

Yes I still remember all those times
When we were so true my friend
I`ll have to take this with me `till the end

All went around
And came around
Now our faith is lost
As we have our faces down on ground

Gone forever - away from my sight
I see a window upon space and time
Like a shadow they took you far away
Falling teardrops on a rainy day

[Guitar Solo - Alin Moise]

Gone forever - away from my sight
I see a window upon space and time
Like a shadow they took you far away
Falling teardrops on a rainy day
