[Music: Petrut, Lyrics: Petrut]

As we rise
The angels fall from the sky
Drowning in fear
In the greatest river of tears

As you see, the story goes beyond all beliefs
When a man walks this earth in obscurity
A warrior brought down by a million fists
Ostracised, victimized to their rotten bliss

Towards the end
They`re lying and faking
Now you`ll see the shattered side of soul.

We come for them all
They are at our mercy
There`s no fallen god to save us from the cold
