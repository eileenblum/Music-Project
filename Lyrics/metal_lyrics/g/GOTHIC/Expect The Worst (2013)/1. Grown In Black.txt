[Music: Petrut, Lyrics: Petrut]

Wheel of destiny is sent
I stare with hate at my best friend
Old,alone and compromised
I see the end through my own vice

I try to victimize the one I was before
Regarding nothingness I enter at death`s door
Trying to justify myself within these four walls
Burning that cigarette, rekoning my universe

I see the world is fading down
The emptiness is going round
I`m old, alone, with no sustain
The grown in black is here to stay

Now when the days are gone
I`m looking back with hate
All I loved back then is lost
And nothing to replace
And when I walk this desert
I`m going all alone
Was grown in black to say
`Here there is no dawn !`
