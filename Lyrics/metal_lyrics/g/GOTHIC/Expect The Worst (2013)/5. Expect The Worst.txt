[Music: Petrut, Lyrics: Petrut]

So I ride towards
The abysses of the scorn
So I feel within
The abysses of the sin

No pain will justify this
Poor hollow soul reaching its bliss
You feel like loosing all control
But that`s allright
Expect the worst

Sometimes you`ll crave the anger
A war of nerves will drain
Expect the worst

In your back a sluggish stench
Senseless words are all you spit
I wonder if you have a heart
Living without makes perfect sense
