Reaching the gates of tomorrow
Time is flying astray
Feeling the past in your sorrow
Hoping for another day

Marching the land of illusion
A heavy burden of confusion

Facing the fears in your silence
Burning in the afterglow
Never loosing your balance
As you go all alone.

Destroying the masses
Thy will imposes.
