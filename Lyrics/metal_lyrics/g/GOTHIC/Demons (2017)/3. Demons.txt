Here I am
Surrounded by old demons
They never left

In the process of redemption
Time will tell
And the fear is left behind me
Fail the master plan
All that's left is the time waitin'
For the end.

I feel their breath inside my dream
The darkness stains around me
A web of black, surrounding scent
The night is growing senseless.

Believer â Deceiver
Crawl down in the deepest mud.
Creation â Isolation
Be alone your entire life.
