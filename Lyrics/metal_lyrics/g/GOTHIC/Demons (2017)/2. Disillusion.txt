We grew apart
Betrayed our hearts
Our souls are black
Our minds are flack
You wanted that
Now take it back in your face

I bow with shame
Living the blame
I felt so blessed
Givin' my best
You let me down
I'll never do it again!

That was a warning from a higher ground
This is the calling from the skies above

This moment had to come
Look what we two become
Maybe someday you'll see
The friend I always been

Our souls are black
Our minds are flack
You wanted that
Now take it back in your face

I felt so blessed
Givin' my best
You let me down
I'll never do it again!

Yeah
We're becoming
Something
Time will take away.

We grew apart
Betrayed our hearts
Our souls are black
Our minds are flack
You wanted that
Now take it back in your face

I bow with shame
Living the blame
I felt so blessed
Givin' my best
You let me down
I'll never do it again!

That was a warning from a higher ground
This is the calling from the skies above

I have to split our ways
To see some better days
To have some time alone
To seek the fortune's call.
