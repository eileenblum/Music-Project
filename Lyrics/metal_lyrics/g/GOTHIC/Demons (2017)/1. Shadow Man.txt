Living low, my purpose
No regrets
Just an empty presence

Born to roam around
To breed the air
I don't need much more in my own lair.

I'll do the fuck I want!
Tell me something
I did it all!

I can decide
Of my own life
I have no plan
I'm a shadow man.

Failing out my life
I feel no shame
Don't point me, society's to blame

Got dirty, got wasted
No remorse
Don't you wait, I'm on a collision course.
