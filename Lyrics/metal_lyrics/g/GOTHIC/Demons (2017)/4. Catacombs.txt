The morning came undone
Found us turned to stone
As the night turned into day

Smoke and shattered walls
A horror sight unfolds
Only ashes will remain

Fire surround us
This is a funeral march
And we are home
Buried deep in catacombs

The morning came undone
Found us turned to stone
As the night turned into day

The distant sounding bells
A choir of wailing shells
The planet's final breath

Fire surround us
This is a funeral march
And we are home
Buried deep in catacombs

Fire surround us
This is a funeral march
Fire surround us
This is a funeral.
