[Music by Gomorrah, words by S. Olafson]

Malignant Form Concealed In Grey
Shaman In Neoplasmic Form
Consuming Life Without Remorse
Ripping Hell Throughout Its Wake
Walking With Death You Feel No Pain
Unconcious Of the Life Within
Yet Slowly Sapping All Your Strength
There Is No Rush For This Impending Doom.

Beyond the Alchemist To Sense Oblivion
Who Would Think To Care Or Look
A Body So Fit With No Fear Of Death
Looking Not To It's Cerebral Code

Each Day It Feeds A Little More
This Creature Clawing Deeper Still
Planning It's Deadly Route With Care
Laughing As It Makes Its Way
No Measure Of Violence, Just Avarice
Growing As You Lose Your Mind
Hidden Battke Is It Will To Be
Manic Cull To Cleanse This World.

Dragging You To Its Stygian Darkness
Unaware You Have Answered Its Call
Riddled With A Parasitic Life
Letting You Live Till It Needs Your Soul

Unknown, The Origin Of Its Mass
Emerging From A Timeless Realm
Beneath The Act Of Conscious Thought
Brought Into Being, A Deiform
Knowing That It Stays Immortal
No Excise Or Act Of Cain
(No) Spilling Of Its Precious Ichor.

Body Laid Down On Cold Marble Slab
Prepared to Enter Fiery Depths
Remembered On Carved Slate Of Grey
The Dream Of Death Now Reality
Purpose Served It Years For More
Not Failing To Find An Open Mind
Reaching Past Fresh Cortex Shell
Embodied To Play Its Game Again.
