[Music by Gomorrah, words by J. Griffin]

Women And Children, There's No-One Forgiven
Old Men Splutter Their Last Breath.
From The Age Of Three, Just These Walls And Me
And Here I Will Crawl Til My Death.
Once Your Minds Read Your As Good As Dead
From This Hell-Hole There Is No Escape.
Some Of Us Are Tame And Some Even Sane
But Freedom Is Too Much Red Tape.

Lost, Lost In Leros.
Lost, We Are The Forgotten Souls.
Lost, Lost In Leros.
Lost, Lead Our Lives Like Puppet Dolls.

They Call Us Crazy, That Might Be As Maybe.
But Animals We're Certainly Not.
Like Dogs We're Fed Then Tied To Our Bed
Just Waiting There Until We Rot.
In These Kennels We're Caged Our Madness Enraged
And The Children Cry All Day And Night.
No Toys To Play Above With Their Beds They Sway
Beyond Reach But Within Their Sight.

From Day To Day Naked We Playh
Like Zombies We Walk Round The Yard.
And Hell We Create As We Vociferate
But Heard With Complete Disregard.
Like Rubbish We're Binned As If We Had Sinned
But I Can't Recall Doing Wrong.
Does Nobody Care Is There No Heart Spare
How Long Can This Carry On.
