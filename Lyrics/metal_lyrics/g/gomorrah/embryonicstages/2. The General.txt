[Music by Gomorrah, words by J. Griffin]

"Thou Shalt Not Suffer A Witch To Live" 
[Exodus XXII, v18]

I Here By Show You The Devils List, Cos By The Devils Work They All Exist.
I Order You To Hang Them High, Burn Them At The Stake And Watch Them Die.
Place Them In The River Tied Thumb To Toe, If Their Heads Should Rise Then We Shall Know.

General, Is What They Call Me. Your Witch I'll Find For A Handsome Fee.
Witchfinder's My Official Role, To Try By Fire At The Burning Pole.

Show Me The Girl With The Immortal Soul, That Innocent Face Of A Baby Doll.
Behind Those Bright Eyes Lays Something Dark, And Upon Her Smooth Skin Lay Satan's Mark.
She Don't Fool Me For I Am Wise, My Needle Test No-One Defies.

I Am The One That The Old Women Fear,
Arrive In Their Town And They All Disappear.
Reputation Before Me Serves Me Well,
How Far Can I Go, Just Who Can Tell.
Devil Disciples I'll Find You All,
Your Names On The List, (And) You've Just Had Your Call.
On These Norfolk Hills We've Found Your Trail,
My Assistant And I We Never Fail.

Townspeople Scared Of Their Trickery,
Inflicting Death, Causing Misery.
Livestock Lost And Much Hunger Felt,
They Hired Me For I Am Their Help.
I'll Rid Your town Of The Devil's Work,
Just Pay Me Well And I'll Cleanse This Dirt.
