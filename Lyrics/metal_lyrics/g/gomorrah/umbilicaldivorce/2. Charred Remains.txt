[Music by Gomorrah, lyrics by S. Olafson]

Suicide Pact, A Self Cremation
Doused With The Blood Of My Own Execution
Felo-De-Se By Propherous Ignition
All Watch In Horror As I Slowly Die
Charred Remains

You Mutha Fucking Bastards
Can't Begin To Know The Things I've Seen
These Charred Remains Still Live With Me
My Friends That Once Had Been
Running From A Blazing Hell Falling From The Sky
Killing Hoards That Wait Below

With No More Hope I Watch Them Die

Let The Cleansing Flame Purify All My Thoughts
Confusion Of Life I Don't Care What It Means
The Only Way Out Shall Be My Hand
As I've Done Before Now I Do Once Again
Charred Remains

Napalm Of War, It Fed My Need
The Need For Fire, Engulfing Me

My Pleasure Grows, I Know The Day
To Join The Ones, I Lost That Day

You Mutha Fucking Bastards
Can't Begin To Know The Things I've Seen
These Charred Remains Still Live With Me
My Friends That Once Had Been
Running From A Blazing Hell Falling From The Sky
Killing Hoards That Wait Below

With No More Hope I Watch Them Die

Blistering Skin As The Flames Set To Work
Screaming With Pleasure Not Long Will I Last
Thru' Melting Eyes I See Not A Thing
Engulfed With Desire, Gladly I Die
Charred Remains

Watch Me Fucking Die
