[Music by Gomorrah, lyrics by S. Olafson]

I Lay Down My Head
The Darkness Of Night Brings My Dreams?
Now I Enter Thru'
The Domain I Fear Yet Lust For Too
And Seek Again My Bride
To Drain Me Like No Lady Could

I Am The One

Where Comes This Demon Whore
From Life This Demon Whore
Where Comes This Demon Whore
From Life This Demon Whore I Know

She Now Hears My Worthless Call
She Whispers Clear And Stops My Fall
Her Wings Unfold
Beast, Goddess, Transforms Herself
By, By, By, Be By My Side
Pure, Naked Her Form Now Manifests

Where Comes This Demon Whore
From Life This Demon Whore
Where Comes This Demon Whore
From Life This Demon Whore I Know

Knelt Astride Me Prone
She Now Employs Sheer Carnal Joy
Scream As Climax Nears
Raking Her Claws Tear At My Throat
Die, I Am In Death
Pleasure And Pain, I Am Fulfilled

I Am The One

Where Comes This Demon Whore
From Life This Demon Whore
Where Comes This Demon Whore
From Life This Demon Whore I Know

Demon, Demon, Demon Whore
