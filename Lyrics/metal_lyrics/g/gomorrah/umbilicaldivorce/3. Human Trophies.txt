[Music by Gomorrah, lyrics by J. Griffin]

"Words by Tracy Edwards"

Solitude Beckons Upon My Night
Pleasures Of Love The Long Lost Flight
In My Departure From Reality
Live My Twisted Tales Of Melancholy
These Depraved Thoughts Fed By Demon Drink
Inebriated Murmurs I Hear Myself Think
Maybe Cruise The Bars And Ensnare Some Prey
Bring Them Back Home I Know He'll Stay
Unaware Of My Ill Intentions
Never Sensing My Bane Sensations

Come With Me And Join My Friends Now
Human Trophies Adorn My Home Now

Desires Robbing You Of Your Last Breath
No One Sees Within These Walls Of Death
Lying Still There In Eternal Sleep
How My Manhood Enters Deep
There's No Need for Any Force
In This Post Mortem Intercourse
Feeling Of Power Over Lifeless Soul
Feeds My Hunger For Total Control
Nevermore Am I To Be Alone
You Shall Never Leave Our Home

The Blades Of My Knife And Saw
Through The Blood I Now Drill This Whore
Tear Off His Limbs And Head
No Longer Do I See The Dead
A Stench Permeates The Air
Another Trophy I Here Declare

The Painted Skulls I Hide
The Body Parts I Fried
The Carrion I Strip
Cadaver In Acid Dip

As I Enter This Domain In Which He Dwells
Clouds Hover Over Rich In Putrid Smells
I Sense Dark Secrets Never Before Told
Pictures On His Wall Let It All Unfold
A Forest Of Fear Swells In My Head
Through Dreamless Slumber I Sense Mortal Dread
Hold Myself Together For I Must Take Flight
From This Charnel-House, Try With All My Might
I Know That Solace Lies Beyond That Door
God, Will I Ever Flee His Quietus Claw
