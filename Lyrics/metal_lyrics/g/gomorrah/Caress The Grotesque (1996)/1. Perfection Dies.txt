[Inspired by Friedrich Schiller]

Even beauty must die:
That which subdues both gods and mortals
Leaves the steely breast of the stygian Zeus untouched

As I wake I hear these words in my mind
Their meaning is one that I cannot find

My head it pounds with a tempered thought
Did my eyes betray that which I sought?
What was his gift for I can't ignore
The question posed now as before

Once and once only did love soften the lords of the shadow
Then, on the very threshold, he sternly revoked his gift

What was his gift for I can't ignore
The question posed now as before
I can't begin to realise
That I'm the one to which they empathise

Aphrodite herself has no power
To assuage the hurt of her lover
His tender flesh ripped by the cruel boar
Nor can the godlike hero be saved, deathless mother
At the Scaean gate when, falling, he achieves his date
She rises out of the sea
With all the daughters of Nereus

And the mourning begins for her glorious son

All good things must come to pas, too soon
Perfection dies
Trusting vanity, fading
Perfection dies
Look back, the mirror shows, Narsus
Perfection dies
Grieving for what I lost, slowly
Perfection dies

See! Where the gods are weeping
And the goddesses, all of them
Weeping that beauty passes
Perfection will always die

Good, a lament in the mouths of loved ones
What is common goes to Orcus unsung

And the mourning begins for her glorious son...

All good things must come to pas, too soon
Perfection dies
Trusting vanity, fading
Perfection dies
Look back, the mirror shows, Narsus
Perfection dies
Grieving for what I lost, slowly
Perfection dies
