Too weak to stand crawling in this darkened place
Of my being there is no trace
Hnad of wrath it greets my pain
Tyrant kin still holds the reins
This famine soil sees this flower spoil

Enshrouded in darkness
Every sound now strikes fear
Alone in my kingdom, no one knows that I'm here
No clues given in this unlit tomb
Bizarre extension to my bearers womb
Open my eyes that lie here drowning in tears

Open my mind to the long lost years
Tormented silence somehow beckons my dreams
Perpetual anguish, how fruitless it seems

Incarcerate... Void existence
Disregard... Non entity
Experiment... No resistance
I'll never find tranquillity

Glaring eyes are hounding me
Not understanding what they see
In an attempt to reimburse
Presenting me an empty purse
Blinded by the mystery
A testament to atrophy

Incarcerate... Void existence
Disregard... Non entity
Experiment... No resistance
I'll never find tranquillity

Living by the rules that my wisdom permits
Under the guidance my senses remit

No light to reach for, there's no reason to doubt
No hope I can will for and no reason to shout
Open my eyes that lie here drowning in tears

Open my mind to the long lost years
Tormented silence somehow beckons my dreams
Perpetual anguish how fruitless it seems

Joy of knowledge, I'll never taste
Potential mind has gone to waste
With their test they'll apparently
Recuperate my infancy
Inculcated with nature's way
No common ground on which to sway
Born again immaculate
Petrified inanimate
Innocence whiter than snow
Pure to a world I'll never know
