Withering beneath my feet
My eyes that scorch the earth dilate
I drink the rivers dry each year
I drown my freezing pain
To quench my endless thirst again
Will take more than the falling rain

Anti season sister cold
Has faded and has watched me grow
And now I walk among you
A source of life to all I see
A single glance to the weak
Can reverse that state with ease

Burning, feel me weaken you
Fading as I linger
Sweating, lifeblood leaving you
Closing in much tighter

Who would want to live against
The mightiest of elements
Feel the wight, my burning heart
Tearing land and life apart
Seasons go, I come again
Eternal, blessed lions mane
I take my place among the stars
Looking down from afar

You to me are lumps of meat
Cooking, basting, excrement
Some worship me and travel far
To sleep at night then back for more
The key to life, I give birth to all
Omnipresent fireball

I yearn and cry
Break from the earth to azure sky
Above me lies my natural realm
Divinity from where I fell
To live again, to rise once more
A demigod to those who went before, once more

Blistering, dehydrate
Your throat it dries, your skin it flakes
But bathing you in warmth
I seem to fill you with a love of life
To appreciate all that I am
You must overcome, adapt, survive

Anti season sister cold
Has faded and has watched me grow
And now I walk among you
A source of life to all I see
A single glance to the weak
Can reverse that state with ease

I yearn and cry
Break from the earth to azure sky
Above me lies my natural realm
Divinity from where I fell
To live again, to rise once more
A demigod to those who went before, once more
