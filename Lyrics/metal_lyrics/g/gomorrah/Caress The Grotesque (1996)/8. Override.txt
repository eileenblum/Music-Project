Unjustified, condemned by my guilt
I feed on the innocent
No mercy I need, obsessed by my thoughts
Unleashing my need to kill
Control's all I fear, increases all I hate
Darkness impairs my vision, destruction is your fate
Destruction, your fate

No more rage, no more pain

Life or existence, truth or a lie
What is the truth, which is the lie
Voice in my mind asking me why
Deformed or a freak, victim to die
See through the dark, blind in the light
Bow to the weak, willing to fight

No more rage, no more pain

Pure adrenalin rush, this host in which I lust
Unholiest of sins, the pleasures I win
Satisfy my need, the hunger I feed
Soulless, in a maze of deceit

I shall live eternally
Your torture I need, your tears are my blood
Your screams are the air I breath
Controls all I fear, increases all I hate
Darkness impairs my vision, destruction is your fate
Destruction, your fate

Pure adrenalin rush, this host in which I lust
Unholiest of sins, the pleasures I win
Satisfy my need, the hunger I feed
Soulless, in a maze of deceit
