Living safe and happy with friends far and wide
In this community with people by my side
So why did no one notice when four years ago I died

Why did they not find me
On the first day that I died
More were soon to pass on by
Before there came the rancid flies
The first week I but wondered
The second puzzled me
The third then made me realise
that a fourth was yet to be

Here I now lay
How long must I remain
Why must I be seen this way

I have had my time
Did I need to die?
Now low here I lie

Letters fall to the floor
Watched by silent eyes
Every know at the door is met by soundless cries
I live in debt and pay no bills, still I have my home
No one cares so no one knows, tell me why this should be so

Laying here, serenity
Silent heights, a lonely climb
Melancholic company
I've been absent for sometime
The first year was so lonely
The hate grew in my mind
Three more years were soon to pass
Open the door to a gruesome find

Here I now lay
How long must I remain
Why must I be seen this way
