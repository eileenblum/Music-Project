Another life finds me numb
Permeate my weakened veins
Motion
Confusing me
Marble dance in ecstasy
Endless worlds beckon me
Opening my brainwashed mind

Feeling the shape of where I have not been
Tasting the rage of the ice and the green
Falling through the light, the few become one
Beneath the sad eyes and the weight of the sun
Feed on me

Laugh at the sky and its love for the ground
Touching the rough, odoriferous sound

Eat of the fruit and the bird in the sky
Rejecting the Zen, understanding the dry
Season the sect of the seven unseen
Gaze from the path to the bold and the keen

Once here now stay
Blood turns foul grey

Orb is the seed, lust draws my eye
Craving the tree as the river runs dry
Beauty caresses, senses I bleed
Stare at the rain to the one that I need
Dark final rape
Forging the blade, mapping the spine
Ripping and tearing the flesh that I climb
