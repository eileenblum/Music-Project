Everything that I do, everything that I say
Everything that I am, everything within my day
That you once thought was me
No longer lives, no longer breaths
But held within is hate and rage
Suppressed when I'm in company

To see my true self, to own my soul
No man shall have that hold on me
I now acht my life, my life so well
And show you who you want...
...To see my true self is to own my soul
No man shall have that hold on me
Which is why I now act my life this way
And show you, show you what to see

This is not me, but what I want you to see
this ain't a change, but what I will always be

The skin you see and recognise
Beneath there beats a different heart
Beats as sure but you can't see
that I now play a different part
Blind before but now I know
My true self and all my goals
All this time I never showed

Everything that I do, everything that I say
Everything that I am, everything within my day
Emotion is a curse to which I never bend
Don't look deep into my eyes
Their vacant stare offends
Everything that I do, everything that I say
Everything that I am, everything within my day

This is not me, but what I want you to see
this ain't a change, but what I will always be
