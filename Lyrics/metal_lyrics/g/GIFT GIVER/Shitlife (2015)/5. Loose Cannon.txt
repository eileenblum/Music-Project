[feat. Frankie Palmeri of Emmure]There's no telling what the fuck I might do. It doesn't matter who you are, I'm liable to hurt you. Some days I only see red, starting fights when I should walk away instead. I just can't keep these inner demons fed. Come try and stop me. Don't be afraid, go ahead.

I'm a loose cannon, starting shit for no reason. Could be the son of the devil, a motherfucking demon.

I get these urges and they just won't quit. They happen more than I would like to admit. Don't come too close, because your fucking health is at risk. You push me too far and you'll fucking cease to exist. I'm a loose cannon, starting shit for no reason. Could be the son of the devil, a motherfucking demon. Let's just say my mood will change with the season, but I can't help it. My whole life I've been a fucking heathen.

A loose cannon, yeah I can't fucking help it. Sometimes I don't know how to feel. Guess that's the hand I was dealt with. Sometimes I wish I was dead. I fucking wish I was dead. Some days I only see red, and I'll start a fight. I just can't keep these inner demons fed. Try and stop me. Don't be afraid, go ahead.
