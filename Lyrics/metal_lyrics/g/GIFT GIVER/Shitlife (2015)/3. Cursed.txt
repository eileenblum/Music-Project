This curse will be the death of me
And I'm OK with it
Why the fuck else would keep making the same mistakes over and over again?
Willingly digging my own grave
I feel its presence and it sees what I see
I know one day this curse will be the end of me

Yeah, I'm broke and my life is shit
And every single step I take I'm trying to end it
I'll never find a way to catch a break
Mistake after mistake
Another smile to fake

I'm always dwelling on the past
Grieving over all the shit that never lasts
It never lasts

So, just throw me in the fucking back of a hearse
My mind is rotting, I can't shake this curse
And you know it's only getting worse
Just throw me in the fucking back of a hearse

This curse will be the death of me
And I'm OK with it
Why the fuck else would keep making the same mistakes over and over again?
Willingly digging my own grave
I feel its presence and it sees what I see
I know one day this curse will be the end of me

Go ahead and curse my name
'Cause in the dirt
I'm gonna rot the same
And I know this curse won't let me leave this earth
So I'm left here to rot.

I'm always dwelling on the past
Grieving over all the shit that never lasts
It never lasts

Go ahead and curse my name
'Cause in the dirt
We rot the same

Go ahead and curse my name
'Cause in the dirt
I'm gonna rot the same
And I know this curse won't let me leave this earth
So I'm left here to rot.
