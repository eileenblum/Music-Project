Don't say you're sorry, cause I know it's a lie. I'll hold this grudge on you until the day I die. You're just a coward, and it makes me sick. Next time I see your face, I'm gonna spit in it.

Maybe one day you'll finally get it, maybe the angel of death will come pay you a visit. Maybe then you'll understand my frustration, while you're rotting away in the hole that you were placed in. Some say success is the sweetest revenge, but I'd be fine with watching your life end.

Don't say you're sorry, cause I know it's a lie. I'll hold this grudge on you until the day I die. You're just a coward, and it makes me sick. Next time I see your face, I'm gonna spit in it.

Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted. I've said it twice, but you don't fucking get it. Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted. You fucked me over, now I'm feeling sadistic. How does it feel? How does it feel to be a face in the crowd? I bet your mother's proud of how her mistake turned out. How does it feel to be at home with no purpose, wasting away in your room? You're never gonna resurface.

You fucked me over, now I'm feeling sadistic. I've said it twice, but you dont fucking get it. You fucked me over now I'm feeling sadistic. I know you're sorry, but it's not that simplistic. You fucked me over, now I'm feeling sadistic.
