I'm gonna make you wish that you didn't exist.

I can take you to the place I go when I'm all alone with nowhere to go, maybe I'll even let my demons show. I can take you where no one has been. I can show you the ropes of how to live in sin.. Or maybe you should just keep your fucking distance.

I can make you wish you didn't exist, you'd be so miserable that you can't resist the urge to hack and slice away at your wrists. All your problems solved by a razors kiss. Do you really wanna fuck with this? Yeah, do you really wanna fuck with this? Why the fuck would you come knocking on hells door without knowing exactly what you're in for? What did you expect? Get it together, fucking come correct. What did you expect? There's no love here, only disrespect.

I can take you to the place I go when I'm all alone with nowhere to go, maybe I'll even let my demons show. I can take you where no one has been, I can show you the ropes of how to live in sin.. Or maybe you should just keep your fucking distance.

Now let me show you that the devil exists. Just shut the fuck up and give me your wrist. Now let me show you that the devil exists. I'm gonna make you wish that you didn't exist. There's no love here, only selfishness and disrespect. There's no love here, yeah this is what you get when you fuck with a hellhound. Cause there's no turning back, you're on the devils playground.
