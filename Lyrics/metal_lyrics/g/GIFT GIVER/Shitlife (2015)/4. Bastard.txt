I've got this lack of feelings in my guts, and it just goes to show that I don't give a fuck. I'm just so sick of always feeling stuck, and it's just my luck. God damn, my life's fucked.

Sometimes I wonder why I turned out like this..

Some days I wake up feeling like I could murder everyone and their brother, sister, daughter and mother. Some days I wake up feeling nothing at all, I sit and question my life cause I'm so sick of it all. You'll find me dead with no story to tell, I'll be shaking hands with all my friends in hell.

So what the fuck is up now? Yeah, what the fuck is up now? I hear you talking that shit, that you know nothing about.

Sometimes I wonder why I turned out like this. But then I stop and embrace it, cause shitty people exist. Now listen up, I insist. You can't tell whats going on in my head, just like you can't kill someone who's already dead. So what the fuck is up now? Yeah, what the fuck is up now? Bastard.
