I thought you heard enough the first time. I'm taking everything that's yours, just to say that it's mine. Yeah, what the fuck did you expect to find? You couldn't run with the pack, so you just got left behind.

I could sit here all day and fucking put you on blast. I used to call you my friend, but that's a thing of the past. I knew your charade wouldn't fucking last, but I never expected that you would flake this fast.

So just let me say it, I've been waiting for the chance to really say how I feel. You talk a big game, but I watched you bail the day shit got real. You fucking bitch. I know you hate it, but you can't even question. I'm a mad motherfucker, with some bad intentions. I'm just releasing this tension, I know there's figures in the bank that you must have failed to mention.

I thought you heard enough the first time. I'm taking everything that's yours, just to say that it's mine. Yeah, what the fuck did you expect to find? You couldn't run with the pack, so you just got left behind.

You're not worthy of the life that you made. If you were dead, motherfucker I would spit on your grave.

I used to call you my friend, but that's a thing of the past. I used to call you my friend, I knew it wouldn't last. Fuck this shit, I knew everything was a lie. Tell me everything was a fucking lie. You were never our friend. You just wanted a free ride. So tell us the truth you scumbag motherfucker. You flaked out on us, but now who's the sucker? Haha you fucking faggot.

I could sit here all day and fucking put you on blast. I used to call you my friend, but that's a thing of the past. I knew your charade wouldn't fucking last, but I never expected that you would flake this fast.
