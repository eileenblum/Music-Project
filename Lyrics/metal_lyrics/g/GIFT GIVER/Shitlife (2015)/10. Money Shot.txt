Go ahead, come and take a shot at me. You've been waiting for the perfect opportunity. So what the fuck are you sitting here waiting for? I'm right here motherfucker, come settle the score. Don't be afraid little bitch, I hear you talking that shit. You ran your mouth about my friends and I, but you won't admit. Already caught you in the act before, and you threw a fit. So come and say it to my face, and get your fucking wig split.

You're talking shit like it's nobodys business, and when we're face to face you're gonna need a fucking witness. I'll blast you with the quickness. A moneyshot to your face, there won't be no forgiveness. Quit running your mouth, before I chew you up and spit you out. You just keep running your mouth. Just some fake motherfuckers that I need to weed out.

I'm sick of your shit, and that's a fucking fact. I can't seem to ignore it, so I'm gonna react. You better watch your back.

If you see me, better watch your back because the people you talk shit about run in a pack. Go ahead, come and take a shot at me. I know you're waiting for the perfect opportunity. So what the fuck are you sitting there waiting for? I'm right here motherfucker, come settle the score.

I'm right here, come settle the score.
