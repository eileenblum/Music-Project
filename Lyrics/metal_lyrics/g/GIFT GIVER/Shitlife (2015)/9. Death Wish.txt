[feat. Tyler Dennen of Sworn In]I've been spending every fucking day biting my tongue til it bleeds, cause all these words that I speak keep rotting out my fucking teeth. I bite my tongue til it bleeds. I keep rotting all of my teeth.

I try to block it out- everything he says to me, but I'm forced to do it cause the devil's watching over me. I try to block it out, but he won't let me be. Why won't you let me be? Why won't you let me?

I can't look back, and I know it's not just in my head. I'm waking up everyday, but I just wanna stay in bed. Why does this have to be the path I tread? It's hard to give a fuck, knowing you were born dead. Nobody ever seems to have a fucking hand to lend. I've got shit for luck, and dozens of these so called "friends". I'm dying faster than I should intend. It's hard to give a fuck, waiting for your life to end.

Why does this have to be the path I tread? Why did I have to be born dead?

I try to block it out- everything he says to me, but I'm forced to do it cause the devil's watching over me. I try to block it out, but he won't let me be. Why won't you let me be? Why won't you let me be? I think I'm dying at the age of 23. I know I'm dying at the age of 23.

23 years, and where the fuck have you been? How could I ever forget the marks that you left on my skin. I always knew this motherfucking house was not a home. I always knew this motherfucking house was not a home. I always knew this house was not a home, fucked up from all the time that I spent alone. High expectations, but I'm not a fucking drone. My mouth has been shut for so long, it might as well be sewn.

It's hard to give a fuck, knowing you were born dead. It's hard to give a fuck, waiting for your life to end.
