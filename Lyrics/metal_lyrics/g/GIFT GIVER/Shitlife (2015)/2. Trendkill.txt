I'm not here to save you, I'd rather be the one who lets you fall. I'm not here to support you, I'd rather sit back and laugh while I end it all. I want to fucking end you all. This is the fucking trendkill.

Stop trying to be someone that you're not. Just grow the fuck up. Yeah, that's some food for thought. You walk around like you're original, but all I see here is motherfucking pitiful. You and your friends are nothing but a gimmick. You were given a life, but you don't fucking live it. You're just too busy trying to be hip, but little do you know.. we don't give a shit. When will you motherfuckers finally quit? Don't fucking get too close, or else you're gonna get hit. Get bent.

Give up on your dreams, that's my only advice. You'll never amount to anything.

I'm not here to save you, I'd rather be the one who lets you fall. I'm not here to support you, I'd rather sit back and laugh while I end it all. I want to fucking end you all. This is the fucking trendkill.

Just what the fuck are you trying to prove? You're all the same from your hair to your shoes, your fucking shitty tattoos. But I guess I'll never understand elitists, seems kinda hard trying to pretend to be shit- that you're not. Yeah we all know that you're not.

Give it up, you're never gonna be hip. Nobody gives a shit, when will you fucking quit? You're all the same and it's a fucking disgrace. So know your fucking place, or come and get a taste. You and your friends are nothing but a gimmick. Watching, waiting for the next haircut to fucking mimic. You're all the same and it's a fucking disgrace. So either know your place, or come and get a taste.
