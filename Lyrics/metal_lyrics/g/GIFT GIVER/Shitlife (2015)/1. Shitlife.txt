I just can't take it anymore. I've got a gun in my mouth, with my head on the floor. I just can't take it anymore. I'm losing all of my friends, got nothing left to live for.

I sit alone and I can't help but think "why?" my fucking friends have to die, all in the blink of an eye. Wishing that I could push these feelings aside, but I'm too fucked up inside cause I just couldn't say bye. Dead friends, dead ends. It all begins to blend, and now I can't make amends. Now I'm just waiting for my shitty fucking life to end. How did it come to this? Why don't you come and grant my motherfucking death wish.

This fear of growing up has been wearing me thin, and I can't pretend that I'm comfortable in my own skin. I'd pray to god if he'd listen, but he's too busy with his children. So I run with the devil because he gets it. They say repent for your sins, but I'm too busy fitting in. Aren't you sick of fighting battles you can never win?

I just can't take it anymore. I've got a gun in my mouth, with my head on the floor. I just can't take it anymore. I'm losing all of my friends, got nothing left to live for.

I don't give a damn what path I choose, they say it's easy to stray when you've got nothing to lose. I don't give a damn what path I choose, I'll fucking take my own life. Yeah, what's it to you?

The fear of growing up has worn me too thin, and I have never been so uncomfortable in my own skin. SHITLIFE.
