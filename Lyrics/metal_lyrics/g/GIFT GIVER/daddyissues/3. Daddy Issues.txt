Who the fuck do you think you are,
Running your mouth?
What makes you think that'd take you far,
Running your mouth?
It's funny that you thought
I wouldn't have you all figured out.
Your time is up,
And now I have to tell you,
Get the fuck out.

This song's for every fight,
Every appetite you ruined for me.
Who do you think you are?
Who the fuck are you?

You thought this was a one way street,
But all it led to was the end of you and me.
I never needed you anyway.

Did you think that I'd forget?
When you told me "I'm not fucking sorry".

For every fucking ounce of self-esteem you stole from me,
I'd pull the trigger on the world
If I could end it today.

Did think that I forgot?
This is what you fucking told me:

Just kill yourself.
Why don't you kill yourself?
Just kill yourself.
Why don't you kill yourself?
Just kill yourself.
Just fucking kill yourself.

I didn't need you anyway.
All I wanted was an apology.
