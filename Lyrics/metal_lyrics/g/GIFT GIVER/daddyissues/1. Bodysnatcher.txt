I heard you're out for revenge.
So come and get it motherfucker.
I heard you want it,
I heard you're coming for me.
Come and get your revenge.

I've got a fistful of cash
That says you won't do shit.
And if you really want my life,
You can fucking have it!

You can fucking have it!

It's just matter of time before we're crossing paths.
You're not so big
When you're out from behind your keyboard.
I hope that you can run fast.

Where are you going? [x2]

I heard you're out for revenge.
So come and get it motherfucker.
I wanna feel it,
I wanna see what you've got
Come and get your revenge.

I've got a fistful of cash that says you won't do shit

I always knew you wouldn't do it [x2]

I fucking told you, mama's boy,
You wouldn't touch me.
