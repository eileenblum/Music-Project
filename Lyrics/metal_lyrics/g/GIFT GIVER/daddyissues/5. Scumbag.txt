That's right!
I never cared for you.
You make me sick,
and I just can't wait to break these ties
that I have to you.

I bet you think you've got the world in your hands.
Starving for attention
Do you think you're a man?

Talking about "swagger".
Yeah, I see right through that shit.
Piss and moan about your life,
But never changing it.

I bet you thought that you meant something to me...
But all you need to know
I'm everything you couldn't be!

I'm calling you out,
You little bitch.

I'll call your ass out for everyone to see.
I'm calling you out.
You lost my respect and your fucking dignity.

Thinking you got everybody fooled,
But you're not fooling me,
you're not fooling me.
You're just a sheep clothed like a wolf.
You're just a wanna-be,
Yeah, you just want to be.

Without your friends,
You're nothing but a no-name bag of scum.
Without your friends, you're nothing
You're not fooling anyone.

I'm calling you out. [x2]
You're always biting off more than you can chew.

What makes you think that you meant something to me?
You've lost your dignity.
You've lost your dignity.

Bitch.

I'll call your ass out for everyone to see.
I'm calling you out.
You lost my respect and your fucking dignity.
