I hope it breaks your heart
Knowing that I am always above you.
I fucking hope your world falls apart
Every time you hear my name.
I hope your conscience tears you apart
When you remember what you said to me.
And don't you think for a goddamn second
That I'll let this slide one more time.

One more time.

You always told me I would go nowhere.
But what you failed to realize,
Was that I never cared to go anywhere.

I'm not buying time.
I'm all for taking this world on a joy ride.
I don't care...
I don't care if I live or if I die.
I don't give a fuck if I live or die.
I'm all for taking this world on a joyride.
And while I'm at it,
I'll take what is fucking mine.

I hope it breaks your heart
Knowing that I am always above you.
I fucking hope your world falls apart
Every time you hear my name.
I hope your conscience tears you apart
When you remember what you said to me.
And don't you think for a goddamn second
That I'll let this slide one more time.

I swear to god,
You won't recognize this person I'm in total control of.
I'm just a fucking man with two faces
That you'll wish you had never...
You wish you had never heard of.
