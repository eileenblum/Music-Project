It's getting old.
Your eyes, your lies, you parasite!
You get off on attention.
Fucking impure affection.

It's getting old.
You think you're plated in gold.
Your time is up, I don't give a fuck.
Can you see my intentions?

Bending over backwards,
Just to find out you're fake.
Devoted so much time in you
My first big mistake.
I've never tried so fucking hard
To make things work out.
I fought so hard for nothing,
Now I want out.

I want out.
Just shut your goddamn mouth!

I've lost my mind,
So you better say a prayer for me.
I'm dead inside,
So I'm sure there's nothing left for me.

It's getting old.
Your eyes, your lies, you parasite!
You won't get my attention.
Fuck your bullshit intentions.

It's getting old.
You think you're plated in gold.
Time is up, I don't give a fuck.
Do you see my intentions?

There's no more respect here.
I'm done wiping up your tears.
There's no fucking respect here.
I never wanted to be here.

Are you happy?
You got what you wanted from me.
Are you happy?
Are you fucking happy?
Are you happy,
You watched everything get taken from me.
Are you happy?

Just shut your goddamn mouth!
Fuck!
