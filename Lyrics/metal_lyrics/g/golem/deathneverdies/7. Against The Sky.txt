There was a time when I was a sacred guardian
I was created to be a defender of the faith
Too many years have passed from my tragic end
That's time for me that someone woke me up

Four wicked souls have snatched myself from my own past
I'll spread the storm, I will destroy and I will do it for them

Start to pray, I'm 'round the corner
And death is by my side
'Cause I've no fear of kingdom come
I was born to raise my sword against the sky

So my own dark march has taken place for you
Upon the remains of someone else, I'll build my fate

If I look back in my life
I see nothing deserving to be remembered
Every place was a dark moor
And I went forward the shadows to look for the stars

That time is over 'cause I have turned the page
So now I've got another mission to complete
Time is coming, I'll be ready, let's start the unholy war!

Now my steel will break up a never ending rain of blood
Stop to sleep, stop to dream, break my chains. So set me free!

I will follow you to the edge of the world
I will not give you any time to rest
But before you will close your eyes, I swear
You'll know who took yourselves to the grave

Golem is my name!

Start to pray, I'm 'round the corner
And death is by my side
'Cause I've no fear of kingdom come
I was born to raise my sword against the sky
