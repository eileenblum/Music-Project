I won't try to fill an abyss
With four disgusting words
But maybe so I seem to be
Alive or less alone
When I tell the emptiness
That sometimes I've down on me
'Cause maybe I deceive myself
That someday you will see

All that days wasted in false promises
Have left to me the anger for a hopeless future
And that rage of tenderness that I can feel for you
Is only a naive apology for something to remind

Fate has decided 'til the end
The lot of this wrong story
By leaving the step to a hanging speech
To a kind indifference

How it's hard to drive away that past
Only made by ghosts that laugh at your shoulders
Above all, when you don't come through to drive them out
When they are the only ones remained which try to make relief
For your never ending pain

All that days wasted in false promises
Have left to me the anger for a hopeless future
And that rage of tenderness that I can feel for you
Is only a naive apology for something to remind

I would try to make up for what is lost forever
But I can only realize that I am too much late
So I cannot feel remorse for what has been
And for my anger I could come through by myself

All that days wasted in false promises
Have left to me the anger for a hopeless future
And that rage of tenderness that I can feel for you
Is only a naive apology for something to remind
For every time you lie
For all you've left behind
