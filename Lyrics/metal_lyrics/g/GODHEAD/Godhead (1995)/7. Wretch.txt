I feel you rot, 
I see you fall.
I hear you say
I turn away.

I see you retch.
I feel no less.

Though I don't believe your words.
I understand your pain.
I have felt to many times
The grip of hate and shame.

A smile turns to sorrow.
A spark to flame inside.
Your words are only echoes.
Shadows in your mind.

Though I don't believe your words,
I understand your pain.
I have felt too many times
The grip of hate and shame.
