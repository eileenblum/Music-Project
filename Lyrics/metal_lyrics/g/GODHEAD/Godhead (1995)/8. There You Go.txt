Don't you take me from this place, 
And don't you ever leave it.
I'd forever stay in here 
If only I'd believe it. 

Never mind what's come to pass. 
All of that is over
As I watch you walk away. 
And my life is over... 
And my life is over...

There you go again (Nothing saves me from anything).
Take from me my hope and direction (can you see me?). 
There you go again (My mind is numb to everything).
Give to me your pain and despair.

Take the knife that's in your hand.
Close your eyes and thrust it.
As I walk within your reach 
I know I can trust it. 

Your betrayal is complete. 
The final blow you dealt it.
Your revenge has been so sweet. 
Even if I helped it...
Even if I helped it...

There you go again (Nothing saves me from anything).
Take from me my hope and direction (can you see me?).
There you go again (My mind is numb to everything). 
Give to me your pain and despair.

I shallow grave awaits for me.
Far beyond another.
Only time is left to see
If you killed my brother...
And you killed my brother...

There you go again (Nothing saves me from anything).
Take from me my hope and direction (can you see me?).
There you go again (My mind is numb to everything).
Give to me your pain and despair.
