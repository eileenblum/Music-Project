I am, I am. 
I am, I am. 
I am, I am. 

I live in your mind. 
You've seen me before. 
Can't leave me behind.
I'll haunt evermore.

Created by youm 
Your failures and fears. 
Remembered by few. 
Always in your tears. 

For I am, I am. 
I am, I am. 
I am, I am the one you hate; 
The one you hate. 

There is nothing real
For you to see.
Your life's so surreal.
That's why you have me.

For I am, I am. 
I am, I am. 
I am, I am the one you hate;
The one you hate.

You run from me
But you can't see
You created me. 
You'll never be free. 

You run from me 
But you can't see 
You created me
You'll never be free.

For I am, I am.
I am, I am.
I am, I am the one you hate;
The one you hate.

I am, I am. 
I am, I am.
I am, I am the one you hate.
