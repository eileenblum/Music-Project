She takes my hand 
Far away from my home.
I take my head, 
Wonder why I can't speak.

And I wonder why I can't
Keep my tongue inside my head.

They killed my soul.
I grow old in this hole.
I want to stay.
Here I lay go away. 

Life in my hands
Falls away from my grasp.
I take my hands,
Wring them out, tear them down.

They killed my soul.
I grow old in this hole. 
I want to stay.
Here I lay go away.

And I'll never be like you, I'd rather change.
I won't rot until I'm through, I'd rather change.
Stagnate far away from me, I'd rather change.
Treachery is all I see, I'd rather change.
They take my eyes,
Pluck them out, cut them up.
I tell them no,
But their ears would not hear.

And I wonder why I can't
Speak in tongues with you no more.

They killed my soul.
I grow old in this hole.
I want to stay.
Here I lay go away.

And I'll never be like you, I'd rather change. 
I won't rot until I'm through, I'd rather change.
Stagnate far away from me, I'd rather change.
Treachery is all I see, I'd rather change.
