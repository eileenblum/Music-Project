Can you feel me now? 
There is no way out.
Can you tell what's on my mind?

I control you now. 
You can feel my power. 
Lick my wounds they'll set you free.

I will take you now 
Where your mind will sour.
You can rest your head.
Take my peace instead.

There's no pain in here.
There's no death to fear.
Lick my wounds they'll bring you here.

I will take you now
Where your mind will sour. 
You can eat your head.
Take my pain instead.

Come inside, take the ride, losing time.
All is well, in my hell, take your life.
Watch my hand, destroy man, and your world.
Come with me, you will see, the end is yours.
