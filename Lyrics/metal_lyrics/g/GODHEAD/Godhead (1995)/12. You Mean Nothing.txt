I can't breathe when you're with me, I can't even think. 
I swallow every promise you can never keep.

Now that I see you for what it is that you are.
I know there's nothing that you can do anymore.

Don't take this wrong, no,
Your never wrong.

But I'll tell you something.
You mean nothing.
I'll tell you something.
You mean nothing to me now.

As I wander through this joke that I call a life, 
I wonder why I even tried to make it mine.

Don't take this wrong, no,
Your never wrong.

But I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing. 
I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing to me now. 

As you can see I already can feel no more.
Ignorance is good when you've found there's nothing left.

But I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing.
I'll tell you something,
You mean nothing to me now.
