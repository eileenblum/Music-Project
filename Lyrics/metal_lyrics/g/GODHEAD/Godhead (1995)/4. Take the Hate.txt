Keep away from me now. 
I know how to kill myself. 
Live behind the iron wall
That you've built around yourself.

My dismay was complete 
When you wrote your master plan. 
Now I live filled with hate
That I hold within my hand.

Thank you for doing this to me.
I'd never know it for myself.
Thank you for doing this to me. 
I'd never find out for myself. 

Take the hate in me now. 
Fill it up within your veins. 
Mind the stray thoughts of life.
They grow dimmer every day.

Thank you for doing this to me. 
I'd never know it for myself.
Thank you for doing this to me.
I'd never find out for myself.

Thank you for doing this to me. 
I'd never know it for myself.
Thank you for doing this to me.
I'd never find out for myself.
