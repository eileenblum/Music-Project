You search for me in places 
Where you'll never find me. 
I've seen the empty faces.
I leave them all behind me. 

Reaching out for something
That's beyond my grasp.
Coming back with nothing,
Hoping this won't last.

The victim and the fall.
I suffer through it all.

There's nothing more.
I have no more.
I am a whore. 
There's nothing more.

I find within your ruins
Only death and dust.
Looking through your sewage,
My bones begin to rust.

I feel the need for something
That's beyond my grasp.
Reaching out for nothing,
Knowing this won't last.

The victim and the fall.
I suffer through it all.

There's nothing more. 
I have no more.
I am a whore. 
There's nothing more.
