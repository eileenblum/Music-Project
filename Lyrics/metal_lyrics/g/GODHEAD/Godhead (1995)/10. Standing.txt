You have no place yet to be.
I have not seen what you see.
Live through hell you've never known.
You will know what you've been shown.

Take what you can from this place.
Watch all the freaks fall from grace.
As the world dies in your eyes.
You will be shown all it's lies.

Standing where I should not be.
Seeing all the horor before my mind was free.
Beyond what I could see.
Standing where I should not be.

Watch them melt into the sand.
Drip and twist into your hand.
Scratch, pick the flesh from your face.
Your head, gone without a trace.

Standing where I should not be.
Seeing all the horor before my mind was free.
Beyond what I could see.
Standing where I should not be.
