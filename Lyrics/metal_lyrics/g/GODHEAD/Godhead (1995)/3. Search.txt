When I sit by myself
I know it's the lonely way. 
What I had in myself 
I have lost along the way. 

But I choose by this time 
To be isolated. 
I know you must think now
That I am already dead.

But I still belong to me. 
But I still belong to me.

Search in my soul to find me. 
Search in my soul...
Search in my soul to find me. 
Search in my soul...

When my mind tells my soul 
I need to be with someone. 
I reject all I feel
For I'm not a chosen one. 

You will see that I know. 
I will never be assured 
That the one I will be 
Has been lost along the shore.

But I still belong to me. 
But I still belong to me.

Search in my soul to find me.
Search in my soul...
Search in my soul to find me.
Search in my soul...

Search in my soul to find me.
Search in my soul...
Search in my soul to find me. 
Search in my soul...
