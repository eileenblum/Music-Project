Feel the hate from my
Misery surround you
As you watch me fall;
As you watch me die.

Slowly I decay
From the world around me.
Slowly I decline
As you hear me lie that I live...
Lie that I live.

Feel the cold from my
Icy hands around you
As you slowly fall;
As you slowly die.

Never to return
To the world you know of.
Fear you will know well
As you hear me lie that I live...
Lie that I live.

You have not known pain
'Til you've lived as I do.
You will never know
'Til you hear me lie that I live...
Lie that I live...
Lie that I live...
Lie that I live...
