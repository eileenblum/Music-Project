You're never satisfied with what I want to be.
You're never satisfied with how you control me.
You're never satisfied with anything you see,
And you'll never let it be.

Forever taking what was never given out.
You never thought of those that had to do without.
You were the chosen one you had to take that route,
And you make the martyrs shout.

And I don't know what you mean
When you say that I'm unclean,
And I don't know why you hate
Everything that made you great.

Forever looking down on what you used to be.
Forever criticizing all humanity.
Forever holding us from ever being free.
You have killed the God in me.

And I don't know what you mean
When you say that I'm unclean,
And I don't know why you hate
Everything that made you great.

You're never satisfied with what you are today.
You're never satisfied with what you had to pay.
You're never satisfied with anything I say,
But I'll never go away.

And I don't know what you mean
When you say that I'm unclean,
And I don't know why you hate
Everything that made you great.

And we don't know what you mean
When you say that we're unclean,
And we don't know why you hate
Everything that made you great.

Unclean...
