Take away...
You take away what you have made.
I don't know you.
I don't know why you've betrayed.

I don't know you anyway.
I don't know you anyway.

Hand me something I can hold on to
That is something I don't have from you.

Hand me something
I can hold on to right now.
I don't need this.
I don't need the run around.

I don't need this anyway.
I don't need this anyway.

Hand me something I can hold on to
That is something I don't have from you.

You can't feel me.
You can block away my life.
This is madness.
This is poverty and strife.

You don't love me anyway.
You don't love me anyway.

Hand me something I can hold on to
That is something I don't have from you.
