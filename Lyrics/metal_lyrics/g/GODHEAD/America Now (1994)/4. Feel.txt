Never knew there was an ordinary way.
Never even seen the light of day.
Holding back from what I thought would bring me pain.
Only now I see was wrong again.

I'm forever lost in thoughts within myself.
Never giving time to anyone else.
You take the only thing I hold to myself dear.
Now I see my future's crystal clear.

Crossed the path of what was undetermined lives.
Killed the road to their salvation.
Now I hear them in the darkness as they cry.
I will never feel elation.

Rid the past of all the wrong that I have made.
Or I'll take these actions to the grave.
Please forgive me all I wanted was to live.
Remorse is now the only thing I can give.

Crossed the path of what was undetermined lives.
Killed the road to their salvation.
Now I hear them in the darkness as they cry.
I will never feel relation.
