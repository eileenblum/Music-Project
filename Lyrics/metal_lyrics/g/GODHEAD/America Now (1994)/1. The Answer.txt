Save me from myself,
Turn me into someone else.

I answer to no one.
You won't speak for me.
I answer to no one.
I will never be a someone.
I will always be alone.

Take me to where I'll like it.
Give me the strength to find it.

I answer to no one.
You won't speak for me.
I answer to no one.
I will never be a someone.
I will always be alone.

Show me the way to somewhere.
Help me away from nowhere.

I answer to no one.
You won't speak for me.
I answer to no one.
I will never be a someone.
I will always be alone.
