I don't believe you when you say 
That you don't know what you want.
I try to understand why you. 
Are never happy? 
You live your life in fantasy, 
And glass cathedrals.
Why don't you come down from your cloud 
And face reality?

I want, I love, I need, I breathe, 
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed... 

Behind the walls they built for you. 
You live your orchestrated life 
Inside your heart you know it's wrong. 
But you can't stop it. 
Your soul it longs for something more. 
But you can't find it. 
And so you blame me for it all 
And choose another. 

I want, I love, I need, I breathe, 
I lust, I trust, I cheat, I bleed...
