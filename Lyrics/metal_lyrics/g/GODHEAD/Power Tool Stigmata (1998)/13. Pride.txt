I can't know what you feel inside. 
But your face can't hide your foolish pride. 

Keep in mind all you left behind 
Was in chains that bind: is that a sign? 

I can't read what you keep inside your mind, 
Protecting what I find within your walls. 

Things I feel that I know just can't be real. 
Trick and try to steal my life away. 

Cold deception goes both ways. 
Watch yourself or you'll get bathed. 
In the darkness that is light. 
As your spirit dies tonight.

I'll tell you something- I know I must be strong. 
For your giving me something- That I know is wrong. 

I can't know what you feel inside, 
But your face can't hide your foolish pride. 

Keep in mind all you left behind 
Was in chains that bind: is that a sign? 

Your intentions become clear. 
All deceptions disappear. 
The inception of your plan. 
Marks the end of modern man. 

I'll tell you something- I know I must be strong. 
For your giving me something- That I know is wrong.
