I can't see myself too clearly, the clouds are rolling in. 
I can't hear the noise around me but I know the sound of sin. 
Where will I be when the world falls down? 
Head first in the mud bent over with Devils all around. 

Kill this craving, 
I can't stop myself. 

Calling for me in my sleep I hear the sirens flying in. 
Can't turn back I'm in too deep I take another shot of gin. 
Keeping the world from consuming me. 
Can't hold back the demon growling from deep within my sea.

Kill this craving, 
I can't stop myself. 
Madness, raving. 

Take me straight to Hell.

Calling for me in my sleep- can't turn back I'm in too deep.
As she rides upon my chest- pain or joy I love her best. 
Takes me far into her soul- crawling, churning, can't let go. 
As I ride upon her breast- takes me down before I save my soul...
