Wishing on planes that I thought were just stars. 
I stretched my hopes from near to far.
I crashed my plane into mountains of sand. 
This boy will never be a man. 

Take me. 
I want to forget my name. 
Break me. 
Let me be the one to serve you. 

I'll tell the man that lives inside my head. 
I want to be like you instead. 
Keeping the promise that I made before. 
Just one more hit, I'll be your whore.

Take me. 
I want to forget my name. 
Break me. 
Let me be the one to serve you.
