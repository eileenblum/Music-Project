Sifting through the ashes of my life, 
I thought I found the one that I could always trust.
Slowly I began to learn that I
Can never judge the things that mean the most to me. 
And all the hate and anger, 
That they all put on you. 
You just threw on me 

And I don't believe that I, could ever be with you. 
And I don't believe that we, could ever be together. 

Calling out to you, try to show the truth. 
But you just carry on. 
Killing everything that we once had, 
And never really understanding why. 

And I don't believe that I, could ever be with you. 
And I don't believe that we, could ever be together.

You've taken everything and left me here with nothing.

And I don't believe that I, could ever be with you. 
And I don't believe that we, could ever be together.
