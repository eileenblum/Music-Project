Pick away at my bones, There's nothing left to see
I've been forever drowning in what you want to be
The soonest I'd be leaving isn't quick enough for me
I don't need a reason to be free
Breathe my life untill you see
There's nothing left for me
I've wasted far too long
Feel nothing after a time
Don't know why, down my spine
Grieving is unrefined
Can't cross the line
I look for a sign
Can you conceal the way you feel
And what you steal from what is real and
Breathe my life untill you see
There's nothing left for me
I've wasted far too long
wasted far to long
Breathe my life untill you see
There's nothing left for me
I've wasted far too long
