A feeling like your left behind
The door is closed and you're confined
To everything you've done a thousand times
You're setting weaker every day
The room is filled to your dismay
It's getting harder to convey just what you're living with
Trapped alone
Burning out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self pride
You kick your feet to run away
But all your effort goes astray
You feel as though you're made of clay and dirt
Now every bone is cracking in
You feel it underneath your skin
You wish you knew the origin of what your living with
Trapped alone
Burning out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self pride
Terror is hear beyond your fear
A ghost of your memory
Desperate dreams can't intervene
The ghost of your memory
Trapped alone
Burning out from the inside
Overthrown
By the lies of your self pride
Terror is hear beyond your fear
A ghost of your memory
Desperate dreams can't intervene
The ghost of your memory
