You've got to wake up, no time to make up
The life you wasted and everything that broke apart
Don't disregard me or this emergency
You are the one that has started this atrocity
I've got a feeling inside that you've got something to hide
And that's what I'm waiting for
There's no apology for your hypocrisy
I'm coming down on you with all of my ferocity
I feel the hate in me awakening (can't stop remembering)
I hide my face to stop my suffering (can't stop remembering)
I feel the hatred, from every word you said
Consume untill I'm driven to my death bed
Now you're inside of me, you'll never let me be
I see the terror of all your inhumanity
I feel the hate in me awakening (can't stop remembering)
I hide my face to stop my suffering (can't stop remembering)
I can't believe the fear and doubt you bring (can't stop remembering)
You made me what I am it's sickening
I feel the hate in me awakening (can't stop remembering)
I hide my face to stop my suffering (can't stop remembering)
I can't believe the fear and doubt you bring (can't stop remembering)
You made me what I am it's sickening
