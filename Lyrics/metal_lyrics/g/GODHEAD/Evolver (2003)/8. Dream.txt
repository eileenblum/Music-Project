If you'd listen to what I have to say to you
You would never be the same again, You're like porcelain
Close your eyes, feel inside
You wonder why i brought you here
If you'd open up just once and hear my words
I would say no more
I would say no more, and you'd feel the same
Dream like I do,It's killing every part of you
Dream like I do, No matter what they think of you
All this time, your surrounded by the ones who lie
Close to you, and they held you from there ugly truth
I'd do anything to reach inside of you
Make you understand
That the answer to your question lies in front of you
Dream like I do,It's killing every part of you
Dream like I do, No matter what they think of you
I would say no more
I would say no more, and you'd feel the same
Dream like I do,It's killing every part of you
(See the way your heart is dying all around your world)
Dream like I do, No matter what they think of you
(Feel the way your soul stops trying, you the prisoner)
