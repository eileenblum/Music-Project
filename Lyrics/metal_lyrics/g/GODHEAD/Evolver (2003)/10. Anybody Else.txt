See me dead before you 
take my mind
I can make you understand
I have tried to help them
Tried to speak
Wasted effort makes me weak
And I want a breakdown
So I can be unbound
I want to be anybody else right now
They'll use this against me
Try to take
All the progress that I'd make
Don't you turn against me
Try to run
Undo damage you have done
And I want a breakdown
So I can be unbound
I want to be anybody else right now
They don't try to break me
They just cut and rape me
I want to be anybody else right now
And I want a breakdown
So I can be unbound
I want to be anybody else right now
They don't try to break me
They just cut and rape me
I want to be anybody else right now
