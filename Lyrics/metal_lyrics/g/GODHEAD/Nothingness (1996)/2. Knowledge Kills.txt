And as I crawl through the sewer of life, 
I feel the wall growing shards like a knife. 
No time to think as the suffering begins.

The icy hand holds me close to the edge. 
I feel the wind as I'm pushed off the ledge. 
I know my mind will forever be enslaved. 

I don't really want to see. 
I don't... 
I don't really want to know. 
I don't... 

Before the sun kills my life and my soul, 
I travel down to the depths of my hole. 
I feel the breath of the world begin to change. 

I don't really want to see. 
I don't... 
I don't really want to know. 
I don't... 

I take the mud and the sand and the dirt.
Rip off my skin before I feel the hurt. 
I turn to you as I watch your face explode. 

The more I know the more it kills me. 
The more I know the more it kills me. 
The more I know the more it kills me. 
The more I know the more it kills me...
