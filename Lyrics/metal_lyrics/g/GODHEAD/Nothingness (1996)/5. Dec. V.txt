I never give what I could take. 
I always steal what I could make. 
I always cross the thin blue line. 
Just look me up, I've done my time. 
I see the world outside my door. 
I take from it you ask what for. 
It's made me what I am that's true. 
I say to you. 

Stay in your place. 
Don't cut your face. 
I'll crush your plan 
If I can. 
Your my disgrace. 

I know just what to say to you 
To make you weak and destroy you. 
I'll break you down and kick you out. 
Show you what life is all about. 
And when you try to run away. 
I'll say sweet words to make you stay. 
And when your back to serving me. 
Here's what I'll say. 

Stay in your place. 
Don't cut your face. 
I'll crush your plan 
If I can. 
Your my disgrace.

Stay in your place.
Don't cut your face. 
I'll crush your plan 
If I can. 
Your my disgrace.
