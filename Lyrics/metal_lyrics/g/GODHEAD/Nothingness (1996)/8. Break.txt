I'm trapped inside the world you sell. 
A product in your plastic, perfect Hell.

Compressed beside your head, 
Just wishing I was dead. 

Break my mind- break my will- break my soul. 
I crumble as I watch you take control. 

Sell me on all the points you make. 
Take from me all the bones you break. 

Forever in your pain. 

Break my mind- break my will- break my soul. 
I crumble as I watch you take control. 

Give me the life I can't endure. 
Your world is anything but pure. 

Forever my torture. 

Break my mind- break my will- break my soul. 
My will to live has fallen down your hole. 
Break my mind- break my will- break my soul. 
I crumble as I watch you take control.
