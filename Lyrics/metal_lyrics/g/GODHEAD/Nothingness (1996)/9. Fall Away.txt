Equally distant 
From the path I've chosen for myself, 
And the alleyway that I must navigate my body through. 

As I watch you drain yourself
Of the life that you've been dealt; 
As you fall away.

Distort my reason.
Distort my view.
This is the torture 
I get from you.

Equally wretched
Are the feelings that you've given me, 
And the knowledge that I'll never be at peace within myself.

As I watch you drain yourself
Of the life that you've been dealt.
Never knowing of my pain.
Never feeling my disdain.
As you fall away... 

Distort my reason.
Distort my view.
This is the torture
I get from you.

Distort my reason.
Distort my view. 
This is the torture 
I get from you.
