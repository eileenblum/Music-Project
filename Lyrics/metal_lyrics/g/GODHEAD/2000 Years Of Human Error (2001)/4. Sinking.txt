Standing in the back of the line 
I feel the others try to push me down and keep it away from me 
Grabbing at the one thing that i know is mine 
Can't you see me with my head to the floor 
feel the recklessness of absolute desperation 
Valued Sentimental pieces of the life I thought held in my hands 

Why do I always try 
To better what I am 
Can't realize that I've always been sinking 

Failing everyday 
It only helps to aggravate 
The sickening feeling inside that won't go away 
Fall Down 
Pick yourself up and fall down 
This is what its like to be me, me 
Can't you see what I see 

Why do I always try 
To better what I am 
Can't realize that I've always been sinking? 

What I am is what I feel 
But what I feel is nothing real 
And what I know is all I want 
Is to be saved from this spot 
Is to be saved from this spot 

Why do I always try 
To better what I am 
Can't I realize that I've always been sinking
