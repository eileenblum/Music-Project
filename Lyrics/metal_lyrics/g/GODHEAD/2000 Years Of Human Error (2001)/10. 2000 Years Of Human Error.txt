I thought you'd tell me the truth 
But when you opened your mouth out came a family of lies 
The book we already read 
Could never helpus from your conglomeration of lies 

You probably believe what you told me 
A never-ending cycle of greed 
Pass it down to each generation 
Another flock of sheep to mislead 

Scratch me harder 
Til I bleed 
God the father 
Spreads his seed 

Liars, liars 
You sell it all to me 
lLars, liars 
I'm what you'll never be 

Give me something 
Something real 
Everything I see is nothing I can feel 
Give me something 
Something real 
Everything I see is nothing I can feel 

Liars, Liars 
You sell it all to me 
Liars, liars 
I'm what you'll never be
