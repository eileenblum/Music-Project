I got a gun in my hand and I feel like a man 
I'm the pope of my generation 
I got to push over your god damn walls 
I don't listen to your condemnation 

Can't you see the pain that you bring 
Is only the cost of everything 
That you wish to stop and bring to an end 
But it only makes me hate you more 

Careful what you wish for 
It can only bring you down 
Keep your spirit on the ground 
Emptiness the only sound 

I know what it takes to break you 
And I'll kill everything that made you 
(And I know what it takes to break you down) 

Take everything that you teach me 
And it don't add up to a pile of shit 
All the methods you use you tried to reach me 
They don't matter a single bit 

I'm alright inside, I'm just trying to hide 
From all the propaganda you want to choke me with 
Keep your face away, keep your hands away
Don't want your fingers in and out of my life 

I know what it takes to break you 
(I know what it takes to break you down) 
And I'll kill everything that made you 
(I know what it takes to break you down) 

I know what it takes to break you 
And I'll kill everything that made you
