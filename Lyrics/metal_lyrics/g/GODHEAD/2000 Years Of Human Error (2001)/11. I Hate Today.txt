Slowly he settles down to give them what they want 
He tries to keep himself together 
I would slam my head into the ground 
Before I'd tell you this 
He turns his head to the floor 
As it falls away 

I'm a product of your hate 
Just the one that you'd create 
Is anyone listening to a word I say? 
I hate today 

You taught me everything I know 
The blame will surely show 
I tried to keep it down forever 

The days have taken years 
To conquer all my fear 
I stand before you now 
Sickened and cut down 

I'm a product of your hate 
Just the one you'd create 
Is anyone listening to a word I say? 
I hate today

Thanks to storm for correcting track #6 lyrics.
