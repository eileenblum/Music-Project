I want to be overcome 
But I can't, I am numb 
I want to see what's become 
Close my eyes, bite my tongue 
If you'll believe in me I'll try not to die 
If work keeps me living its got to start giving me life 

I'm so tired of living here 
I'm so tired of living here 

I want to run and be free 
But I can't, I'm so weak 
I want to hold you again 
In my arms, my old friend 
I have just one more chance to feel 
What is real 
I can't keep going I feel my mind slowing 
My heart's torn apart 

I'm so tired of living here 
I'm so tired of living here
