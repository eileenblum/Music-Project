To the gates bearing this frown,
The threatening forces storm the grounds,
Ceasing escape, our pain must drown!

Once moved freely through these lands,
Retaining crown under demands,
Rising solid we shall stand...
For our command!

Storming oppression,
The last obsession,
Last rites before
A life no more.

Storming oppression,
No false conception,
My rites for more
Apply no more.

Doors of oppression must come down,
To the gates pleading in frown,
Determination gains the crown.

Storming firmly for the throne,
Mighty fortress overthrown,
Falsely forbidden we were left...
But not to rest!

Storming oppression,
The last obsession,
Last rites before
A life no more.

Storming oppression,
No false conception,
My rites for more
Apply no more.

AHHH!
