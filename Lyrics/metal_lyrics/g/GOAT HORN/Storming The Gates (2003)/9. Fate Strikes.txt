Can't sense the end is calling near,
Awakened fate, the gates appear,
Now summoned of the calling,
The claws of time stop crawling,
With brittle cheer, a silent fear.

The light - the mystery has come to be!
A chosen face for destiny!
Moving forward on to be,
Dreams not dreamt, this is for real!

Swept into the calling breeze,
Fate stricken sight revealing ease!

Fate strikes adjourning this appeal,
Final flight chosen course conceal,
Oppressing fortune to be free,
On due escape farewell to thee,
We're on to be...

Fate's brought us here tonight,
And now I see the light,
In through the gates we go,
On to the end where we don't know,
Our destiny finally told!

The fog now clears from lands once feared,
Forsaken fate, gates re-appear,
Last rites are brought before me,
Fate strikes, no final warning,
Forever never endlessly.

AHH...
