[Sacrifice Cover]

Brain dead, descending to flame
No way to survive or have life regained
Re-animation to bring back the dead
Revive the soul, resurrect

Synthetically revived to regain control
The spirit world sends back my soul

Pierce the needle through the back of my head
Chemicals flow, I'm revived from the dead
Brain exists, my soul descends
Re-animated, my sleep ends

The final curtain has been opened to regain my soul
Blood restores my flesh, ice cold

Awakened, now I break the silence of life
Raging uncontrollably, pummeling with spite

Re-animated
