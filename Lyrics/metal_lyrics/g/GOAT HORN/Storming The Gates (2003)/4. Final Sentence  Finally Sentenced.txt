Awakened - forbidden dreams confess.
Burning - the scorn of what I bless.
To forge ahead correctly we'll betray,
Breeching stray, effecting final days.

What was done - facing the final sentence.
Come undone - dismissed without a preference.

Revealing - while living to descend.
Reaching - fulfilled what I intend.
Behold the season of reason to believe,
Expired past too late we can't retrieve.

By no one - release overdue penance.
What was done - facing the final sentence.

It's come to be,
Finally,
Sentencing will be received.
From this plague I am relieved.

Rise and see,
Finally,
Grace will cease the storming breeze,
This submergence has taken ease!

Finally,
Sentencing,
Once it's chosen I'll be free,
Stricken by reality!

Eternally,
Swirling free,
Envisioned gleam triumphantly,
Ongoing grace to be received...

Finally!
