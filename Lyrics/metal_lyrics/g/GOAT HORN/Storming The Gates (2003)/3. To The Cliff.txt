The time has come to do away,
Clear the waste, none to betray,
Destroy the false, imposters we will slay!

Now off to the cliff,
For we will dismiss,
As we do away,
With what we dismay,
What ever is in our way,
The objects pushed astray,
I will feel never again,
Any sense of betray.

To the cliff...
As we persist to clear possession we won't miss!
Cease to exist as every problem is dismissed,
Launch all dilemma into the abyss!

Broken by rock,
Over the cliff!
