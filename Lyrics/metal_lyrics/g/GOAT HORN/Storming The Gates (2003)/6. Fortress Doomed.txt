In the distance, the shadows appear,
Intent is growing near!

Through strength we will deny,
Refutation under threatening skies!
Through the trees guided in storm,
Attempts impelled, creations reborn!

Drink from thy bow,
Courage will lead us in!

Through the gates, to tame the throne,
Onto where we see our home!
Attempts assure intentions stern,
Intimidation dies intern!

Aligning for the light beyond,
Embracing firm upon our dawn!

With all concern the vision is clear,
In sight the last frontier!

On horizon the fortress appears,
Interrogation under doom filled sneer!
Holding strong, pushing beyond,
Crusade storms further on!

Drink from thy bow,
Courage will lead us in!

Through the gates, to tame the throne,
Onto where we see our home!
Attempts assure intentions stern,
Intimidation dies intern!

Aligning for the light beyond,
Embracing firm upon our dawn!
