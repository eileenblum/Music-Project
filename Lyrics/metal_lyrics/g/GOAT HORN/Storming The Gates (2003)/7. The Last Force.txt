Breaking the ruin, through forces of doom,
Conquest for wasted warriors consume!
Clouds we steer in a wrathfully sneer,
Shedding clear a path that will endear!

Confidence in security we have grown,
Endless eternity on the throne,
Last rites secured inside our home!

Feel - the - last - force!
Rising to stand over command!
One last force - must enforce!
Bracing the land by our own hand!

Flames are racing, our fuming keg is gracing - beyond!
Congress praising the silver shine they're facing!

Inside the fortress our forces now thrive,
Aside the mistress remorse will hide!
Restless soul soldiers conquering toll,
And the patrol, for good has taken control!

Smashed astounding foundations taken grounding,
For the sounding envisioned final counting!

Confidence in security we have grown,
Endless eternity on the throne,
Last rites secured inside our home!

Feel - the - last - force!
Rising to stand over command!
One last force - must enforce!
Bracing the land by our own hand!

Flames are racing, our fuming keg is gracing - beyond!
Congress praising the silver shine they're facing!

And now we bear the right,
Our vital fortress shielding bright!
A blaze thrown to the sky,
This shedding light you can't deny!

Instinct assures our reign is known,
Confident in security we have grown,
Endless eternity on the throne,
Secure your faith inside the last force!
