[Arthur]

Rising from the ocean like a fortress
from the black,
The Pagan sacred isle "Ynys Mon"
It looms before me now there's no
turning black
As my Kingdom and my destiny come

I'm sailing on the wings of time,
The paths of fate unfold, entwine,
For I must face the warning tribes
I must embrace and unify
Kneel,
This Dragon Isle Cathedral forged
upon the anvil
and honed from the stone,
Steel
Sceptress its mountainous steeple
Land at no command but its own,
This throne,
Dragon Isle of Ynys Mon, home

Hallowed down the centuries,
through this sacrificial age,
These dark foreboding towers of stone
It is my calling I was born to this place
Where the timeless seeds of history are sewn,

I'm sailing on the wings of time,
The paths of fate unfold, entwine,
For I must face the warning tribes
I must embrace and unify
Kneel,
This Dragon Isle Cathedral forged
upon the anvil
and honed from the stone,
Steel
Sceptress its mountainous steeple
Land at no command but its own,
This throne,
Dragon Isle of Ynys Mon, home
