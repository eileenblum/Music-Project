[Morgana]

The perfect spell, you could not resist,
I cast it well, beguiled and bewitched,
The evening fell and knocked like before,
But this time Hell had come to your door,

Trick of the light, (Shape)
Shapeshifter,
Thief in the night, behind a lovers disguise,
Dream (Hey)
Shapeshifter,
Tracing the face of a lie your eyes betray

My changling heart can mould you within
This fire starts with vegeance and sin,
I guide your hands, control every move
I steal your love, I win and you loose

You've taste Hell and still you wants more,
