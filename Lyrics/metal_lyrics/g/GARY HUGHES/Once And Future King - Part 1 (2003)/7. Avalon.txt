[Lancelot]

It's a emotional crime,
You should be here by my side,
I'm set on manking you mine
I cross a dangerous line
Oh, but I can't barely describe
The way i want you inside

I love you,
I need you,
The truth will not decieve you
This heat grows stronger every day,

Don't you go, won't you stay
Girl I'm beggin' you to find a way
For this feels so strong it just can't be wrong
And it grows, every day
Just like dreaming but I'm wide awake
You and I, we belong, this is Avalon

You're an obsession of mine,
The only face in my mind,
You are my one of a kind
As sure as love is not blind
Oh, and though your love is implied
I'll peel away your disguise

I love you,
I need you,
The truth will not decieve you
This heat grows stronger every day,

Don't you go, won't you stay
Girl I'm beggin' you to find a way
For this feels so strong it just can't be wrong
And it grows, every day
Just like dreaming but I'm wide awake
You and I, we belong, this is Avalon

We live in turbulent times
We never know what we'll find
I see that look in your eyes,
You turn away but can't hide
Oh, you're giving all the right signs
So just give in and don't fight

I love you,
I need you,
The truth will not decieve you
This heat grows stronger every day,

Don't you go, won't you stay
Girl I'm beggin' you to find a way
For this feels so strong it just can't be wrong
And it grows, every day
Just like dreaming but I'm wide awake
You and I, we belong, this is Avalon
