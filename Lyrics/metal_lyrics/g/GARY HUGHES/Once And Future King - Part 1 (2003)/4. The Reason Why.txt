[Lancelot]

In this world we are more or less
entwined in a race
Losing ground, it's a brittle mess,
designed to decay,
We never dream to think of others,
Lie in the face of truth

We're ensnared in the ties of love
then bound by a ring
Spring is short as the cries above,
resound, deafening
But 'silence' greets the brink of summer,
"Why?" meets the winter's chill

Show me the reason why we put
chains on our lovers
How can we justify this king of control?
Show me the reason why we enslave
one another

We swear to keep our promises, in
time we renege,
And though we sleep in the dragon's
lair, we're blind to the flames
We're callous, disrespect our brothers,
Fight in an age of fools

Show me the reason why we put
chains on our lovers
How can we justify this king of control?
Show me the reason why we enslave
one another
