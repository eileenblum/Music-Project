[Galahad]

Born of a nightmare nad your heart never breaks
One of the black lair's fateful mistakes,
No one sensed the storm was comin'
No one sensed the mountains start to crumble
The laws tore

Dawn and the light snares every crime like a stain
Spawns as the rites tear, tempers the blame,
No one breached your lies and cunnin'
No one reached your heart but now its over
The walls fall

For you dared, now the battlefield is bloody,
And you shared, what was sacred is undone,

You're the queen, it's obscene how
you lied and schemed
You're a fake; there's a snake deep within ya
It's a web that you weave out of vile deceit
You've got blood on your hands,
You're a sinner

Your thrust at the heartland with the sword of bretayal
Trust tore apart there, honesty failed
No-one's left to save you woman
No one rests; the blame is on your shoulders
For all time

Is your soul full of sandness?
Is your heart full of hate?
Were you touched by the madness?
passion and fate;
No one cares and now you're runnin'
No one can deny that now it's over
You're long gome
For you strayed and I should have
seen it coming,
Now you pray, only look what
you've become,

You're the queen, it's obscene how
you lied and schemed
You're a fake; there's a snake deep within ya
It's a web that you weave out of vile deceit
You've got blood on your hands,
You're a sinner
