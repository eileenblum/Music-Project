[Merlin]

The time has come
There's no other way now
This crime is done
It tore what remained of our reason
'Right' is gone
This 'Wrong' is the shame
As it buries the soul for your treason

This night has come
It falls from the rain clouds
This blight is done
Flawed with the stains from your scheming
'Sight' is gone
We're 'blind' by the pain
So we stab at the heart of the demon

Crawl out, bruised by the landslide
Fools fate, destiny's jaws
Ground down, used and abused by
Love like a silent blade
Shout; bleed as the dammed die
Too late, venom and claws,
Gouged out, wounded and tongue tied
Love
Love cuts you down in flames

This plight has come
Full circle again now
But what was done
Can't be erased to redeem her
Trust is gone
The people are shamed
She must burn at the stake to appease them

Crawl out, bruised by the landslide
Fools fate, destiny's jaws
Ground down, used and abused by
Love like a silent blade
Shout; bleed as the dammed die
Too late, venom and claws,
Gouged out, wounded and tongue tied
Love
Love cuts you down in flames
