[Arthur]

Life, testing my courage tonigt,
Stretching my sanity,
Broken and bruised, open and wounded inside

I thought that you loved me, you lied
Stabbed at the heart of me,
Callous and cruel, showed me no mercy this time

This web of lies is to blame, binding the pain,
You betrayed me time and time again,
Why don't you answer me,
You left me crying in the rain, blind and afraid,
Now the broken words I have to say
Echo but my heart has turned away,
You'll never lie me again

Gone, ended before it's began,
I need no sympathy,
I was a fool and now the damage is done

This web of lies is to blame, binding the pain,
You betrayed me time and time again,
Why don't you answer me,
You left me crying in the rain, blind and afraid,
Now the broken words I have to say
Echo but my heart has turned away,
You'll never lie me again
