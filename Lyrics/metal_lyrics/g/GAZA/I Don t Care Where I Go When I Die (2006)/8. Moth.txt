We support your cause.
When you're not strong enough to make the right decisions.
We support your god.
When you're not smart enough to make the right decisions.
You're still breathing through puke breath.
You're still sucking off rashes.
You're still lapping at the lardy teats of Hawthorne Heights.
We'll dance our legs to pulpy nubs until he smiles through the death cloud.
