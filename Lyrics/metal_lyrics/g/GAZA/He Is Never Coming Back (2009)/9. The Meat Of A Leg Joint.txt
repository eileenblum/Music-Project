The sky was gray and you were a small child without bones in your arms.
Now you're a man who died propped up against a fence in the shadow of your
favorite bible story.
Still without bones in your arms.
A mourning husband with a pistol in his hand.
He will smile at you with the meat of a leg joint in his teeth.
