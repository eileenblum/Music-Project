I pulled the dead horse out from under a tarp in my back yard piece by piece.
Once proud, once full of strength. She was gold.
Mostly hair and bones now.
I dragged a leg around the yard for hours wearing a path.
I left it there in the sun abandoned like a child's bicycle at the call of a mother.
Mostly hair and bones now.
