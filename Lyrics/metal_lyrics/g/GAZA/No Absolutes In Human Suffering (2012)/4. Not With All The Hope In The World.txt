The earth was warm from the sun.
You weren't ivory like the movies.
The dirt stained you, dissolved you, eroded you, revealed you.
You couldn't escape that. Not with your faith.
Not with all the hope in the world.
So I kissed you on the teeth and laid there with you in the sun.
And you answered more questions there than you ever did breathing.
The dirt eroded you. Dissolved you. Destroyed you.
