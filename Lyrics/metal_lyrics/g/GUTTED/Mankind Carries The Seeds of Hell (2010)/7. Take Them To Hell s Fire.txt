I can feel you thru these walls of mine
I have been locked here
And now I'm totally forgotten
No one's body can take it for so long
On the endless shores of the human agony

Bring me a piece of your body
Bring me something I've never felt

There's nothing there but You
Captured as an animal,
Fed on my long dreaming suffering

Entrails, rotten body parts
These are what you had
But I will never give them back to You
It makes me crazy, cannot hide my feelings
Blood, lots of blood this is what I need

Give me your blood;
Guve it to me as a gift

Those walls, they're never existed
But you stand on those walls of mine

Who is it? Me? You?
Are we the same?

I'm gonna kill you both,
Make a pile of your body parts
And let them burn
With the power I got from you

You can see it was grown inside of me
And when it's free it kills
Living behind my eyes
Hidden, wild animal

Now it is free, waiting for me
Waiting for my command to kill
All the memories they are dead now
Sweating from inside
Sweating blood and agony

Those walls, they're never existed
But you stand on those walls of mine
Bring me a piece of your body
Bring me something I've never felt

It is over now, look at me dying
Cut my throat by your hands
Cut my arms by your hands
Take them to the fire of Hell
And never bring them back...
