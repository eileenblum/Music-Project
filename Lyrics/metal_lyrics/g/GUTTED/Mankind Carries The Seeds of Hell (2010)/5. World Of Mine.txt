Enter into the world of mine
Into the world which can't live without me
My blood runs in every river
My flesh feeds the dead and undead
We are pulsing together
Our bodies under the same control

This is my world, can't be destroyed
This is my world, dying without me

Flame of ignorance burns in their eyes
Flame of ignorance will burn them away
As I surrounded by them
They are eating my flesh
And drinking my blood
Feed my slave as the pigs
They will die as the worms and reptiles

Fighting the enemies
- That's the way They'll learn from me
Fighting the enemies
- That's the way They'll die alone
Consuming the enemies
- Soon They'll learn from me
Soon They'll die alone
- Consuming my own enemies

They worship me, idolize me
They grab me and drag me into Hell
They bound me, fed on my flesh
They will live on as They're consuming me
They will march on as I die
My life becomes their life now

I'm rotting under the surface
My body is the substrate of their life
This world is dying now
Can't live on without my flesh and soul
I will come back one day
Revenge will be written on my flag
