Dead bodies whispering thru the night
They brought back the taken souls
Dead bodies whispering thru the night
They'll make you feel when they arrive

Souls of the raped children
Stained in every single way
Experienced memories
They come alive again

Behind the black, deep hole
Behind the black, deep eyes
Eyes of the witnessed
Faces of who buried

They are six feet deep into the ground
Near the Hell, near their home
Never to come back again

Condemned to never forget

What happened to them
Stays in their heart forever
Never ending pictures
On the never ending sufferings

Relatives of the strange ideas
Parents of the child abuses
On the highest flame of Hell
They will be punished by Those
Who were once raped
