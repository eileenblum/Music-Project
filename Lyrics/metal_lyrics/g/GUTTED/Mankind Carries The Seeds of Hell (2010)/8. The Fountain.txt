One thousand years
Fragility of existence
Driven by our love

Eternity of our love
Prallel stories of our love
Out of tree of life
Rejuvenation
The deity sacrificed himself
To create the world

Fear of death
Never accepts dying
Driving me crazy
Driving me mad

You will never die
Death is just a disease
You will never die
Death is what I fight
You will never die
The cure is in my hands

Together we will be
Together we will see the Light

Xibalba collapses and supernovas,
The quests fail and succeed
Death will never conquer
The Deity sacrificed himself
To create the world
