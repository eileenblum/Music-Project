Bow before me - I'm your masterI'll devour all of your memoriesDrop to your knees - Start to worship meI will smash all of your memories I'll keep killing you until the end of timeThen you'll feel what the real suffering isI'll make you suffer with my endless powerIt continues forever and ever after In this place - You're my servantYour dreams have been cursedIn this hell - I drink your bloodYour body is decomposedAgainst me - You have no chanceI'm sucking your energy Your soul will be hurtIt is hanged on my chainsYour soul will be burntOn the fire I've created I'm fed on your dreamsAnd after the digestionI will puke them outOne by one Cage of your tortureRules your controlControl which haunts youImmortality I made you serve me, you are my slave nowCannot escape from this hell of mineThis is not a nightmare, it's realityThe pain what you feel real as hell You will be damnedDamned forever Out of your bodyNo longer humanMemories torn apartI took them away Now you know - What I've doneThat's irreversibleYou stuck here - No escapeMemories won't get backA memory prison - Built from bloodWalls bleed endlesslyA memory devourer - That's meYou will get what you deserve
