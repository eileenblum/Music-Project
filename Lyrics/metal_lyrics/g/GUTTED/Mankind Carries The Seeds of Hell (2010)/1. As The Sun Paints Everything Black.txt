As the sun paints everything black
Earth sweats blood of human's flesh
Green of our world passes away
Peeling, rotting, shedding its skin

Skin melted, colours faded
Dead men walking on the street

People of the Earth - You brought Hell
People of the Earth - Face the aftermath
People of the Earth - Walking as the dead
People of the Earth - It's time to be erased

Our sun imbibes our senses
Imbibes everything that moves
Imbibes everything that breaths
Imbibes every one of us!

(We are the) cancer of this planet
Breeding, breeding
Infection must be stopped

(We are the) infection of this panet
Breeding, breeding
Cancer of this planet

We are in the hands of the designer
Hold us for a while
But we cannot escape from him
Destiny follows us as a shadow
Strikes when our time is up
Our time is up!
Chains of the world's end unleashed
Our time is up!

Try to hide, try to run
Try to cover, in vain!

You can feel it thru your skin
You can smell it thru your nose
You can see it everywhere you go
(That) everything is painted black
