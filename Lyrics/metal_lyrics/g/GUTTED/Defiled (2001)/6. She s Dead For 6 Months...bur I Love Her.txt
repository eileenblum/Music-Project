I'm lying in my bed my mother by side of me
She'd dead and motionless just starting at me
Dead for six months and even she loves me
Guiding me through the hard times
The smell in my house is unbearable
My mother's body is half eaten by worms
Rancing through my mind a strange illusion
I whish she comes a little closer now
Smell of her rotting body makes me insane
I want to fuck her this mournful day
Her severed body takes my pain away
Her legs spread open then I stuck my cock
Rotting pus on my standing,, bloody cock
I feel the paradise when I milk off
