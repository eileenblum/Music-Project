I woke up the morning, by the early sunbeams
It ain't special cause, I do it every single day
But there's something in the air today
I don't know what but a really smell
My opened eyes make the awakening perfect
Horrible pictures in my sight
The evening ended with murder
My young little sister's lying named in her bed
I howl for my parents but its too late
Now the massacre come back to my mind

Brutal murder in the family-room
Parts of body deep in blood

The evil
Ghost who possessed me last night
It's called the lack of parental care
