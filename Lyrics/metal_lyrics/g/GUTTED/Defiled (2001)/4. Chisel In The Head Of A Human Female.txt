When I realized that your body was given to someone else
My human thinking mind got totally gone
When we met I had all tools near me
I could feel the smell of someone else
If I could see the face of it in you
You have been him
In that very moment
Spoiled thoughts ran around in my mind
I knew I would kill you
But did not know how
But when I saw the chisel
I had no complain anymore
It reached you faster than I thought
I could clearly see how brain splashed
Not only my brain but my face got full of blood
I tasted and realized how much I love you
If you loved me
You would not have done this
And I would not know what a chisel can do
I do this with anyone that lies to me
But you have been the one that created on me
