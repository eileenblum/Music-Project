I've had a fight with my husband
He gave me a lifelong experience
He got home in the middle of the night
He was intoxicated - totally drunk
I was talking to him about our future
When I got hits on my face
Total lack of morality
Living inside stupidity
An animal instinct lived behind his eyes
Which was forced on me through his arms
Why have I married you?
I asked myself lying on the ground
Then I passed out, my body collapsed
Next scene in my mind:
His voice calling my name
Facing down in the anteroom
My arms nailed to the floor
He was standing by me, holding something huge
You're gonna die tonight!
The disillusion was more than pain inside me
All my dream were shattered away
Blood on my hands, tears in my eyes
Empty thoughts in his head
How could I escape from this nightmare
Why does he enjoy it? Thinking... and then
Terrible pain strikes my backbones
He attacks me with a rolling pin
He is disgusting, hate him, hate myself
I've chosen this man, I can't believe it!
He went tired, I passed a out again
Waking in the hospital - a real nightmare begins
Now I'm just lying here
This bed will be my prison - forever
He took my life, my future
Everything that once I had
