Family - intimate nest of calmness
Father - mother and the children
Parental care by alcohol and drugs
Father never gives a fuck about raising
He is an alcoholic important
Molesting individual thoughts
Every night is a possibility
To violence, drade, kill
The children are in an agony of fear
But never violate the regulation
Drunken father by the table
Calls for the children
It was his last act
Intuitive reactions against rules
Rapid movements, tortured body
Deadly intentions
Concealed hate strikes again and again
Father preaches no more
But his relatives free than never before
