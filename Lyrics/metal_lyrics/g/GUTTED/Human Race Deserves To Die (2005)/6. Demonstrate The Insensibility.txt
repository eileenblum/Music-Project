The world locked me out, you along with me
If I think about you, all I feel is disgust - I don't need you!
It hurts when you touch me, though I used to love you
I will never forget it, but I don't need you anymore
Kind words turned into fights, loving touches became bloody
Broken bones, crushed skin
Is what you gave me over the years
I fear thinking of you, and even the sex hurts
But I had to spend a quite a few nights with you
When, before the Lord, I said: through thick and thin
What I got was always the thinnest
I wanted to run away but you found me
Law is still on your side, nobody believes me, because I got no money
Makes no sense to fight - I have to give you my child
