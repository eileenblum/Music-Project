My scroll imbalance
Has taken the lives of hundreds
Some say it developed as a product of my malicious lineage
My mother - a Flemish whore circus freak who thrived on flesh
My father - An inbred butcher with an addiction to dead sex organs
Which ever way you see it, a deadly poison now swims in my semen
It will rot and burn a pussy inside out on contact
It will engulf and scourge the sweet lips and everything else that is pussy

Innumerable corpses decorate my habitat
From furnace to freezer they cover my home
Hidden in floors and ceilings - Liquefied and painted on my walls
It reeks of death on a hot day

It was not till anal sex that I realized another way
When I get off in their asses - they didn't burn from my death sperm acids
I should have been happy but I'd grown accustomed to sex and murder simultaneously
I cherished coating their insides with my napalm trajectories
Her cunt must burn
I sedated her with a 9-iron till I was ready for round two
Her eyes, mouth, and pussy are soon to be go
It always takes a second to burn and now I watch her wail in excruciation

She begins to curl up like an ass ball and I finish her off with a Cleveland steamer
She was my only girl to be fucked twice before death
Her skull will be my ashtray
The pelvic bone my crowm
