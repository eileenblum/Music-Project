It started out, As a romantic evening with my
300 pound aunt Phyllis

We had a bucket of ice and the finest champagne
On this fat bitches body, My fluids are soon to reign

The thought of running water turned me into a madman
As I pulled down my pants and pissed on her face

She sat there quite clueless, Eating her steak!!!

Psychotic impulses spurting out though my dick
A full bladder, Has once again, Drove me to insanity...

It dripped down her neck, To her jiggly fat tits,
The fat bitch is lucky, I don't have the shits!!!
