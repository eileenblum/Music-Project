No son-of-a-bitch, could ever fart better than me,
The stench of my gaseous statments
Could suffocate a child back to a fetus

It smells like an army of insects
Crawled inside my body and died
It smells like the sewage of city
That's been backed up for 499 years!!!

The skin off their bodies.
Begins to turn gangrene.
As soon as they smell my rot
And while they cough up their insides.
I laugh in a fury of madness and hate

You could cut the stench with fucking knife!!!

That son-of-a-bitch. Couldn't fart better than me.
No son-of-a-bitch. Could ever fart better than me!!!
