[Words by Delgado JosÃ© Espronceda 1808-1842]

Y encontrÃ© mi ilusiÃ³n desvanecida
Y eterno e insaciable mi deseo:
PalpÃ© la realidad y odiÃ© la vida.
Solo en la paz de los sepulcros creo.

"And I found my hope had vanished by now
And eternal and insatiable was my desire:
I felt the reality and hated the life.
I believe only in the peace of sepulchres."
