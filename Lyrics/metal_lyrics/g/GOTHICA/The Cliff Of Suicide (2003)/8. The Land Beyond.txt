From the rugged mountains, 
Down to the valley, 
Amongst the fresh clouds 
Which cross my body, 
The wind doesn't let me breathe 
And I dream of dying. 

Everyday I want to enjoy 
That sensation of mystery 
Which I perceive sometimes, 
So strongly, 
It swells my heart, 
Forgetting that there's no going back. 

Delicious dream erases my fear 
Of the end which is coming.
