[Lines by Christina Georgina Rossetti 1830-1894]
Thou sleepest where the lilies fade, 
Thou dwellest where the lilies fade not: 
Sweet, when thine earthly part decayed 
Thy heavenly part decayed not. 

Thou dwellest where the roses blow 
The crimson roses bud and blossom: 
While on thine eyes is heaped the snow - 
The snow upon thy bosom.
