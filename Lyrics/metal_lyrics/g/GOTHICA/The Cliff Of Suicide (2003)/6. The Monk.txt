Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas, 
Nocturnos lemures, portentaque. 
[lines by Horat]

Agitur animus in noctem et 
Tenebrae oboriuntur. 
[lines by Seneca]

"Dreams, magic terrors, spells of mighty power, 
Witches, and ghosts who rove at midnight hour." 

"The mind gets confused and 
wanders groping in a thick darkness."
