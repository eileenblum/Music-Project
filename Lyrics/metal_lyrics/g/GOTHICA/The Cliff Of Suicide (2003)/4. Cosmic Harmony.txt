A gentle throb, a warm breath, 
The consciousness of travelling, 
Of the mysterious end 
Distinguish us from cold shadows. 

Mute voices in the universe, 
So different, so anonymous. 
Creators in the arts: 
Orphic, evocative spell. 

It's cosmic harmony which gets lost 
Into the infinite emptiness.
