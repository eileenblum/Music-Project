Standing on a Brink, Looking to a Distance
Seeking but not Finding, blinded by Divine Light
and Finding oneself in Darkness
Creating but Destroying...

A Diamonds Space stretches above him
And it keeps Mystery of this Silence
A Circle of his Dreams narrows
and leaves nothing face by face with him...

A Conception of Infinity: what is it?
How many Signs are in this Number?
Unconscious Horror nibbles a Single Call
of a Primitive Amoebas!

Standing on a Brink Seeing Emptiness
Seeking, Finding Darkness...
Blinded and founding Sight in Darkness
A Circle of his Dreams dissolves into Atoms!
And They turned into Tears falling
on the Mystery of Silence!..

Dreams... Solitude... Silence...
Sitting on an Ass... On the Infinitive Ass of Eternity...
Sinking in a Space of the absence of Thoughts!..
Dreams... Solitude... Silence...
