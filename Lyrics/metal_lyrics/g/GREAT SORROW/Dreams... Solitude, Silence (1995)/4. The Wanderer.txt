The Purple Star fell through beyond Horizon
And Glow has gradually melted away
My Hope dies, I'll go on my Way again
along Oblivion Highway...

Oh, I'm Lonely Wanderer
I'm doomed to Long Suffering
And my Life is a Way
between the Past and the Future

But Hope does not leave me
and I will find my Rest...
and I will enter a new World!

I'm like a Bird released, I rush about
from One Shore to Another
I can't find my Shelter and a Reply
to my Question... Nowhere...

But Hope does not leave me
and I will find my Rest...
and I will enter a new World!
