Poisonous Wind Soars over a Green Lake of Death
and rocks Bloody Drops on it's Surface...

You run away from a Grey Reality
and dive in Rainbow Waves of Dreamland
Soft Water-Plants entwine your Body
and pull you down to Bottom
Into swampy Filth, and no Way out from there...

Scarlet Green Lake of Death absorbs a New Victim!

Sweet Dreams turned into Nightmare
Your Terrible Dreams turned Reality
You try to resist but it is too late!..

Dirty Bandage and Rusty Needle
are callow gods of a Black Cult
They keep their Mysteries of the Bottom
of the Lake in the Valley of Nightmare!..

You Run away from a Grey Reality
Just think: can you pay for it with your Pain?
