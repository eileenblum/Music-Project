The Light has died
and Bleakness hang over me
I gaze in it, I make request!
My Soul is full of Pain,
the Inevitable oppresses me,
I'm not Free
How long this gonna go,
I can't resist...

Enormous Clot of Matter
is rushing along in a Maze of Space
it absorbs Time and Space
it threatens the Universal Harmony

The Orchestra is out of Tune
under Man Conductor's Hand
I hear an ill Sound
of Doomed Melody in Agony...

The Light has died
and Bleakness hang over me
it gazes into me and it keeps Silence...
My soul is full of Pain,
the Inevitable oppresses me,
I'm not Free
How long this gonna go,
I can't resist...

Enormous Clot of Matter is rushing along...
But if a Tree can't bear Fruits
it must be cut down!
But All has Limits and Prelude
can't stay in endless Agony...
Oh, Preludy of Tears!
