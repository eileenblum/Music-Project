Scintillating Sun rises over
a Terrible Splanding Rich Tumult of Paints
A Fantastic Scerco, a furious Dance of Despair
into Dazzling Protuberance

Poisonous Sphere of Useless Being
grinding Clambering Mind with Cynicism
Pungent Wash of Venous pus
crawls in Deafening Peals
of Hysterical Loud Laughter...

Powerful Pulsation of Universal Orgasm
under a Mad Allegro of Unimaginable Agony
A monstrous Pain of Dissolving
Naturalness in Blossoming Scabs of Leprosy

A Crystal Platform of Doomed Mind
cracking and disintegrating to Bits into Nowhere
And Absurd Restoration of Rotting Modification
a Diamond necklace on Blackened verdure!..

Suffocation Helplessness tears away
a Sticky Rubber from inflames Face
Thin Needles driven into Eyes
and drive a Glance through Cracking Eyelids
back in Clot of Abscessed Neurones...
