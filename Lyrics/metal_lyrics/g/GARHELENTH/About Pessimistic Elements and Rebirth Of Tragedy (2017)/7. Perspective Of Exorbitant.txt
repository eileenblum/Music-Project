[Lyrics: Hilnorgoth Jun.10.2010 / Edited Jan.20.2011]

When textures are hiding
Then meanings are writing
With countless lies
Beyond deception
A sinister soul
Who search for blood
Exorbitant "Neither of them know"
Exorbitant "Neither, neither"
Prophecy untrue, sacred unfold
They'll come to advise us
Meanings of life has been liar
Corpse of the minds
Carnages of ancient rusts
Crosses and signs are meaningless
Exorbitant "Neither of them know"
Exorbitant "Neither, neither"
"War between war
Hate between hate
For this age of dark
Slaves to altars
Feeling logical darkness
As we climb the ladders of hell life goes on past
They've never been ancestors nor demons, nor gods"
