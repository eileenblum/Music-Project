[Lyrics: Hilnorgoth June.07.2010 / Edited Apr.11.2011]

Like silence kill the truth
Turn the pages for the words
A sacrifice beneath the blade
Foolish conscience: destination's unknown
Foolish conscience: temptation's so huge
Philosophic questions
But foolishly answers
Age of fools and little beliefs!
Bushyasta, break the mirror
Turn the pages, for healing (healing)
Foolish conscience: destination's unknown
Foolish conscience: temptation's so huge
Advices to us!
Then blindness of eyes!
Knowing, unknowing!
Questions unsolved!
Nebulous-like grim-heads
Unknowing by kings...
"Take this sword you faithful apprentice
And kill who says the truth
Don't let them speak, nor let them know
Just kill them all..."
