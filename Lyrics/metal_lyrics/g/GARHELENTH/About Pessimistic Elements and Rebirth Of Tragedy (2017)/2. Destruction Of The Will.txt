[Lyrics: Hilnorgoth Nov.24.2010 / Edited Jan.13.2011]

War to hell and war to heaven
Will to love and will to power
Self-forgiveness of human being
Blind eyes that cannot see
Destruction of the will
Revenge and will to kill
Will to reason about good and evil
Rend of flesh, react to speech
Unchain the truth, false theories we have
Curse you all, you must burn in hell forever
Destruction of the will
Revenge and will to kill
"With darkness that is real"
"Disease the false theories spreads everywhere
And fools become our lords!
The power to believe, the power to ignorance
Makes no sense between the gardens on fire"
Bringer of Night-throne!
