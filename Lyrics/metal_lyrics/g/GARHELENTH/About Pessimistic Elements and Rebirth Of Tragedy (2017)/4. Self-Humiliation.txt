[Lyrics: Hilnorgoth Nov.23.2010]

Guidance to hell
Carving an idol
Respect with the one
Self-humiliation
Slavish instincts on your brains
Self-overcoming... (Wonder!)
Death beyond your face
Untruth abstraction
Sacrifices!
"Wildness so evident
By the hand of un-logic signs
The bringers of unwise false theories
They just have to advice
Completely wrong, evenly false
And at the left hand of shame, they are"
Self-humiliation
