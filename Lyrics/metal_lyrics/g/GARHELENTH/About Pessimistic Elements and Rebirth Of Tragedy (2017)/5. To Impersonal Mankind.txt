[Lyrics: Hilnorgoth Jan.03.2011]

Sunlight and twilight
Wretchedness of brains
Will about the goodness
Reaction of all
Damnable advises
By human being
Hellish nigritude
Slavish consent
Perfection or emotion
"Evil arise"
Same confusion
"Slavery"
Hole of the histories
"World of the dirt"
Symbols for worship
"Heads to hanging"
Judgment by man
Foolishness of man
Rays of bad-thinkers
Hatred by wises
Blaze from the old books
Thoughts are same ashes
Moon is dead, sun is dead... hate...
"Give back our souls"
