[Lyrics: Hilnorgoth Jun.14.2010]

Let me know the purpose
Then let me see the words
I don't agree the judgement
I am not yourself
Moral to pessimist
I've not concord with you
When I am not as you're
For what your brain is growing?
Let me know...
Deception of the mass
Direction of glory
Damnation to your earth
Damn to all...
Moral to pessimist
"Angra Manyu comes"
