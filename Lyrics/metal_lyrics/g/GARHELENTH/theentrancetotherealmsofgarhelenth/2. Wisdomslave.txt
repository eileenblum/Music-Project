"Gathering, a plague behind exclusive heretic mind
Slithering, blood flows from eye of the gnostic ghost"

Mountains of grimness
In front of my shabby face
Nothing remains
Decaying moments of time

My eyes are so blind
As I try on the heap
Failure I am to the end
Demonized my soul the darkness

Intense slavery
Visions suicidal
Baptism by fire, baptism by ice

Soul searching distance
Shame of ignorance
Hunting the memories
Whist and later decease

"Then hiding the giant..."

"Stony flesh barded
Principle of writtens
Nostalgia from past forgotten
Since blood stains flows to ground

Cobwebs on corner in table
Philosophic roles, gnostic darkness'
Moments of droll
Shameless moan appears suddenly ahead"

Insomnia... Insomnia...
