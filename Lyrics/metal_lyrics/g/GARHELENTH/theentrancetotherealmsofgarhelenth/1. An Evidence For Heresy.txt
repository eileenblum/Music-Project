Night comes down
Wisdom of nature is here
When graveyards slumber
Comes to our soul
Cancer on brain

Deconsecrate... Mysteriousness...
Blind eye that cannot see
All together gives growth...

Six-hundred misery
Goat from beside
Mournful Nature-hate
Monument of frozen soil
Sacrilegious
Misanthropist
Cleansing with march
Forces of all...

Ah... ha ha ha...

And condemn your fusion with grace
Your choice has been dead!
This time is not so far, death days!
No beauty is everlasting... suspect!
Lust and pleasure awares
Your heart no longer will exist
Became my slave I'm your idol
Inner sanctum, pity from (the) bells

[Music: Hilnorgoth, lyrics: Hilnorgoth. July 6.2011]
