Realm still burns
Their honors (ha ha ha ha)
Holocaust in land
Dark lords

Commands by priests
Slavish obedience
The bringers of plague and misery, were there

Relate from the doom
Unlogical oblivious testaments,
I still see!
I still see!

"Scream from north land
Chalets of old past
Blood-written books
Beyond intellectual aphorisms"

"By the power of the battle-beast we create..."

"As the wall collapse reasoning comes as legacy
Unfortunate shames of malice shall now begin

Eternal judgment of hate growth foreseeable heresy
During hellish fires

Shall sunset role the sky to God and demons bellow
Nor solace makes difference

Tormented intellect, no longer rise again
Abhided in shadow, for it death gives evidence"
