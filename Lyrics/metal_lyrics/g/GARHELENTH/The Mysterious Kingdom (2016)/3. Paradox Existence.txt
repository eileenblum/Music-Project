Older than past
Colder than winter
Darker than shadow
Paradox Existence

Rare as the truth 
Over the castle
Nine hundred Ghouls
Between the mountains
Front of the gates
Of nature throne
In mirage of plagues
Of darkest crown
Monsters of power
Idols of dust
Visions of vanish
Blindness of sight

Older than past
Paradox Existence

Fears upon, tears above
No one exists, fortune of kings!
Paradox Existence, Paradox Existence

Older than past
Colder than winter
Darker than shadow
Paradox Existence
