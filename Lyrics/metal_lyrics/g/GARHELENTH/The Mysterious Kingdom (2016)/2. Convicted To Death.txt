Convicted to life imprisonment forever
Condemned with wisdom in prisons of hate
Bloody tears of Tishtrya
This unperfect circle, rectangular shapes "Wonder!..."

Drowned in moonless and hopelessness night
Funeral procession...
Death conviction has rise again
Returning to darkness we own

Nameless existence and baseless dominion
Vultures are searching for the stench
Wisdoms are lost and the reasons are dead
We answer to questions with NOT!

Drowned in moonless and hopelessness night
Funeral obsessions...

I'm so far away...

"Holocaust is everywhere"
