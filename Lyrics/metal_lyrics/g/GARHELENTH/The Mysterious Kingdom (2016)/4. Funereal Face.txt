In fact I am mortal
With a funereal face
Thoughtfulness with concept
Strong fallacies
Evil in darkness
Demons of mind
Nature's oblivion
Then dreadful existence
Darkness' conceptions
Nocturnal betrayal
Curse of the wolves
Around deception

"Struggle for nothing, with incisive swords"

Naming your world
With darkest splendor
Hiding your secrets
And fight for wisdom

"Struggle for nothing, with fatal desires"

Fighting for reason
Here is no beast
Donât feel infernal
Donât feel eternal...
