Life is nothing except loneliness
We have to live, we have to die
Nocturnal damnation in silence
Shout and scream beyond the elder evil

Grim arts with hatred
"Unconscious deeds"
Ritual begins
"Hatred comes forth"
Tyrants will rise
"Realms of the holocaust"
Mountains of hate 
"Will to power" 

Life is nothing except loneliness
We have to live, we have to die
Nocturnal damnation in silence
Shout and scream beyond the elder evil
