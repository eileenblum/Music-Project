O nature take thy hand of ancient past
From where the snakes are crawling
Come forth upon the man and eden
Open the black wings of Raventhrone

Not, they're coming from hell
Not, we'll face the truth
Not, this kingdom shall fall
Not, the slaves shall free
Pan, nihilism regrets
Upon, the throne of catharsis
