Have you ever been to Darkland
Where heavy haze covers your mind?
Waiting for the day is over
To hide your head under your pillow tonight

Spend your days watching the ceiling
Bound to desperation
You try to thinkâ¦and thatâs in vain
Searching for the answers to all your questions

Then you see youâre on your knees
And your mind is full of disease
When you feel like drown in mud
Sink or swim, thatâs all you got
Opened eyes but narrow vision
Breaking down
Youâre searching for the reason
Seems like all things have gone bad
Struggling in the darkened side of life

Have you ever fade to grey?
Have you ever thought nothinâs worth?
You used to have illusion,
Then turned into confusion

Spend your days watching the ceiling
Bound to desperation
You tried to thinkâ¦a waste of time
You canât obtain the answers to all the questions

Feeling lost and angry
No one hears you cry
Locked inside the walls built by yourself
Youâre asking why

[Chorus]

[Lead // Miguel / Dani]

Face your fear
