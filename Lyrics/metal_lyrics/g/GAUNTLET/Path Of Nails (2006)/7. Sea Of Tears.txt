Iâm lost
Without the heat of your heart
Without your hair between my hands
Iâm down
Without the shine of your eyes
Without the touch of your skin
Drowning in a sea of tears

How long ago did I say goodbye?
I donât know, but all is coming back to me nowâ¦

[Lead // Miguel]

How long ago did I say goodbye?
I donât know, but all is coming back to me nowâ¦
I was a fool, your sweet music died
I was blind, and now itâs too late to start it all again
One more timeâ¦
Donâ say that itâs over, come to me, just one more night

[Chorus]

Maybe you thought I was made of stone
You were wrong, Iâm just made of flesh and bone
Iâm just a man and I make mistakes
I feel the pain, he time is passing by as I watch the pouring rain
I know that you, deep inside, feel the same

[Chorus]

How many times Iâve cried for you
Thereâs nothinâ left that I can do
Look in my eyes and you will see
Our love remains inside of me

[Lead // Dani]

[Chorus]

How many times Iâve cried for you
Thereâs nothinâ left that I can do
Look in my eyes and you will see
Our love remains inside of me

[Outro harmony // Dani]
