He comes from deep space
Watches the human race
And he brings the Doomsday
His skin is cold as ice
His soul betrayed by lies
There was no other way

The whole skyâ¦ in flames
Itâs time to play a gameâ¦ of death
Here comes his master
He builds the Death Machine
Destroyer of our dreams
We have no chance to win
But there is hope in me

He will cross the Universe
Speeding like a Silver Bullet
He leaves a thousand stars
Behind his back
Watching the galaxy pass by
At speed of light

But now he knows the truth
He knows what he must do
And he fights his Master
His power is amplified
By the Supreme Nulifier
He prevents disaster

You know the reason why
You have to pay the price
No one will ever defy me
This mudball will be now
And forever your home
I leave you here, my son
Together we were strong

[Chorus]

Oh, my God, I canât stand the pain
I will never be free again
I canât stand the painâ¦
Never free againâ¦
Never

Beware of the World-Eater
-Itâs one with the Universe-
One day he will come back to Earth

Beware of the World-Eater
-It will never be defeated-
One day he will come back to Earth

[Pre-chorus II]

[Chorus]
