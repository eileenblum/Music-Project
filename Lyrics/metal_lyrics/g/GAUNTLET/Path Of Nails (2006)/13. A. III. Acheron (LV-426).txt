Iâve been dreaming for a long time far beyond the Sun
Floating in the deep blue space, cradled by the stars
But every night I wake up drowning in a soaking sweat
I have to face up to it âcause this nightmare never ends

Riding the storm, rough air ahead
Colony in sight, the complex looks dead
Rain on my face

Here inside itâs hot as hell
Taste the tension, slice the air
We go down into the hive
Ohâ¦my God, theyâreâ¦ still alive!

Motion trackers off-scale, theyâre coming out of the walls!
Registering moement all over the place, we have no chance at all
Exterminate those motherfuckers! Fire in the hole!
Redy for the dust off âcause weâre falling one by one

Donât leave me alone, the wind screams outsid
Stay wide awake, they come at night
To take us away

Sold and betrayed once again
Condemned for a fucking percentage
On the screen approaching fast
Iâm not wrongâ¦theyâre right on us!

Fixing these weapons, straight to the nest
Bursting those eggs I will take my revenge
Holding my girl Iâm face off with the Quee
Stay away from herâ¦you bitch!!
