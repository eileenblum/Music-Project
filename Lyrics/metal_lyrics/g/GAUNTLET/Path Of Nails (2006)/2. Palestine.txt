In the dark alley of Gaza
Fear and misery, a threat for everyone
The tunnel is wasting their lifes away
Years of fighting and nothinâ to gain

Theyâre speaking all the truth
Israel began to rise
Upon a nation still alive

Tears of blood fall on the ruins
Walls of hate in Palestin

Palestine! Palestine!
Burns down in flames

Betrayersâ stench is polluting the air
Tension is high everyday, everywhere
A nation condemned, controlled by fear
Forced to live for their enemies

With âAl-Nakbaâ, desolation
âIntifadaâ is over on the streets
What did you obtain with peace?

Patrolling your properties
Jewish troops take Palestine

[Chorus]

[Lead // Dani]

[Chorus]
