Awaken from the hypersleep
No one knowsâ¦why are we so far from home
Mother, can you tell me?

âSave Our Soulsââ¦or a kind of warning?
We were told to answer any call
Landing on a wicked world

Thereâs no evidence of life
Inside this hostile atmosphere
The vision is so frightening
Letâs get the hell outta here

Beneath a layer of blue mist
Let me enlighten thisâ¦
I canât believe my eyes
Something is moving inside

Suddenly, his face is captured
By an alien incubation
We canât remove it from his skin
Itâs impossible to kill

Around his throat
Like the hangmanâs rope
That goddamn thing
Keeps him barely alive
In an asphyx dream

Bursting through his chest
It dyes it all deep red
Defiantly, it rears its head
Please, donât let it escape!

Disgusting surprise
Too late to realize
What weâre trying to hunt
Has become man-sized

Blood like fire melts the steel
Acid running through its veins
 Hidden in the darkness
Awaiting the prey

Along the ducts comes crawling
You have taken your last breath
Sharpened teeth spear your face
Dropping jaws bring death

[Outro lead // Miguel]
