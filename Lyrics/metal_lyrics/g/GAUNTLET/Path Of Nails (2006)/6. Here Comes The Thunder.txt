Walking across these misery plains
When all for me is said and done
Nothingâs gonna change my life

Just when I think
This life cannot be worst
I hear a crumble from the sky

Screaming with anger I pray to my god
All that I want is to save my son
Caught in the crossfire, itâs shattering us all
The rocket strikes on the helpless ones

âFreedomâ, what a precious wordâ¦
In the mouth of the Powerlords
Playing king, playing God

The U.S.A. keeps telling lies,
Poisoning this world
Kneeling down, as they command

[Chorus]

Weâve come to rescue you
-Heal you!-
And then let you die
And the world is blind
This world is blind

[Lead // Miguel / Dani-Miguel]

[Chorus]
