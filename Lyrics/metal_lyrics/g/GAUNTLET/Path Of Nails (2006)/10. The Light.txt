It used to be so easy
To believe in love
But itâs hard to have dreams
When your heartâs been ripped off

And then you found me
Sinking in a painful sea
Out of love, out of my own
No more light to be seen

I wish to stop the clock
When I look into your eyes
I feel that nothing else cares
When you take me with a glance and smile
All this time without you
I have been lost and found
âTil you came along with me, babe
Iâve never felt so strong

This is real love
Not a fairy tale
You gave me the strength
I needed to face up life again
Everyday you make me wish
To be a better man
Thatâs why I want you to know
I will never let you go
âCos youâre the light I live for

But now everything is over
I never thought you would
Leave me this way
My heart is forever broken
No one could fix the pieces again

I canât believe my destiny
Iâm just guilty of loving you
My life has been erased
And thereâs nothing I can do

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus ]

[Lead // Dani]

Donât you know it?
Can you feel it?
Youâre the light I live for
Donât you hide me the way to your heart

[Lead // Dani]

[Chorus x 2]

Donât you know it?
Can you feel it?
You hide me the way to your heart
Donât you know it, baby?
Donât you know it?
