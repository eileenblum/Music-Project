Follow me
Donât you be afraid
Let me heal your wounds

I have smelt your fear
I have seen your loneliness
Come to me
Join our herd

Give me your money
Bring your family with you
Iâll take care of them
Wipe their wallets
Wash their brains

Be one with Us
We are The Chosen Ones
Letâs make our paradise
Donât care about the price

Iâm the Grime Reaper
Open your mind
Let my rotten lies
Fulfil your life

Bow to our Golden God
Learn the only thought
My shallow friend
Be my slave

We are over you
We are after you
Thereâs no escape from me
Once you have come in

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
