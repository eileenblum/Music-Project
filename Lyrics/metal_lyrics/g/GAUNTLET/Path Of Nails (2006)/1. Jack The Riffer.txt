Straight to your face, breakinâ all bones
Graspinâ your neck right through your door
Heâll bang your head against the wall
Without your teethâ¦boy, you wonât laugh!

Heavy Metal junkie, twisted mind out of control
Heâll rip your het and guts and throw your carcass in a hole
Then sodomize our grandma, burn your house and kill your dog
In hell heâll leave your soul

Crush you all     Thrash you all     Blast you all

Riff you to the core
Hail Jack the Riffer!
He will play at doctors with your sister

Summer dancers, almost famous, fashion clones
T.V. trendies, mudfeet idols, disco thugs
Donât blame on him, itâs not his fault
He hates you all since you were born

[Pre-chorus]

Wreck you all     Grind you all     Eat you all

Riff you to the bone

[Lead // Miguel]

Heâs the one
Hail Jack the Riffer!
He will play at doctors with your sister
Heâs the one
Hail Jack the Riffer!

[Outro lead // Dani]
