I am trapped in a ring of fire
âTil death do us part
All the sweetness became savageness
As the years went by

Oh, here he comesâ¦bloodshot eyes again
The perfect sonâ¦a real coward

Heâs fading out your shine
Heâs fading out your life

Break your chain
Unchain your soul
And let your spirit fly above
From your dark and grey destiny
Donât look back now
And rise your head
You have the will to leave that man
You donât need to live this life
No more
Nevermore

Unchain your soul

You tried to leave him once
But you always felt so scared
Now, even you deny your fate
Youâre under his spell

Oh, no, noâ¦here he comes again
The perfect sonâ¦what a nice husband!

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

The make-up will melt on your face
Showing your real life
How long will you survive?

Thereâs still hope if you grab my hand
Lifeâs too short to waste your time
Donât let him beat you twice

[Lead // Miguel / Dani]

[Chorus]
