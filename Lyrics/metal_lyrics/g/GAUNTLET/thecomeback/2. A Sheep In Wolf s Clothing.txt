Iâve seen people like you a thousand times
Child minded man playing real life
You bet more than you own, itâs time to pay...

Annoying one, piece of shit
Parasite of human beings
Coward one, hollow man
Gossip boy, but nothinâ real to say

You will never dare
To tell me that straight to my face
Just because youâre nothinâ
But a sheep in wolfâs clothing

You pick on me thru your computer screen
Inside your car, behind the shield
How brave you are in your fantasy
Iâll welcome you to reality

Annoying one, piece of shit
Parasite of human beings
Coward one, hollow man
A carcass, just an empty shell

You will never dare
To tell me that straight to my face
Just because youâre nothinâ
But a sheep in wolfâs clothing

And when you least expect it
I will be there behind you
That shadow in the alley
A voice in the silence
The fist that will crush you
The fist that will crush your bones

[Solo: Dani]

You will never dare
To tell me that straight to my face
Just because youâre nothinâ
But a sheep

You will never dare
To tell me that straight to my face
Just because youâre nothinâ

But a sheep in wolfâs clothing
