Driving all night long
On a dusty dead manâs road
Listen to the echoes of a scream
Inside my head...Iâm not afraid

Your bullet killed my body
But not my raging soul
Someday the smile on your face
In a grimace will become

Iâve been waitinâ through the years
For a nice fuckinâ chance
Itâs time to sleep, to say goodbye
Itâs time to rest

Look at me... donât you recognize me?
Follow me...to the never ending fall
Feel the pain... in the bottom of your grave
This is real... this is my comeback!

The chase has just begun
Theyâre hard on my heels...
Watching my lonely evil way
Iâm the target... I donât care!

I still can smell your fear
Guilty man knows the reason why
My revenge comes to an end
From my deepest hate

Now Iâm coming back to hell
Ainât a bad placeâ¦ someone said
Full of friends, full of fun, bad girls,
Drugs and rockânâroll

Look at me... donât you recognize me?
Follow me... to the never ending fall
Feel the pain... in the bottom of your grave
This is real (this is real!!!)... this is my comeback!
