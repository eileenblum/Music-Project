I like to think I left you there
When I stood up and walked away
From the place we used to visit every day
Slightly beaten by the wind
I felt it blew you out of me
I hope it was forever

You fill my mouth with snakes
You set my blood in flames
And sew my eyes so I canÂ´t see the light

Time has come to break the ties
Get the fuck out of my life
You love to stab my soul and hide the knife

DonÂ´t you hear my words?
IÂ´m begging you to leave me alone
You won some battles but IÂ´ve won the war
DonÂ´t take my hand to come along
ThereÂ´s no room for you in my world
You will never ever take control

IÂ´m free from this day
As you die away
Together for the last time
Did I leave you there?

All these years in a rollercoaster
Up and down, a trip to nowhere
We could crash or just go off the rails
I wanted to be invisible
Keep myself inside a hole
I donÂ´t wanna play that role...no more

Too many times IÂ´ve seen
The ugliest side of me
Now I know who I donÂ´t wanna be

Ill got rid of you at last
But sometimes you want to annoy me
YouÂ´re just a shadow of my past

DonÂ´t you hear my words?
IÂ´m begging you to leave me alone
You won some battles but IÂ´ve won the war
DonÂ´t take my hand to come along
ThereÂ´s no room for you in my world
You will never ever take control

IÂ´m free from this day
As you die away
Together for the last time
Did I leave you there?

[Solo: Miguel]

I wont let you in, so read my lips:
I want you dead
