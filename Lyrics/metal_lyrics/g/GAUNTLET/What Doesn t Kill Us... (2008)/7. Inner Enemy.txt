Into the void I am
The conspiracy of my mind is taking control
I'm losing the fight, I canât breathe, no ask for mercy
Life is passing me by
Loneliness is taking me to darkness
Youâre watching me from above
As Iâm sinking in these quicksand
Will you throw me a rope?

It seems that Iâm falling deep
Into the twilight of my life
Iâm just a shadow of what I used to be
Man, itâs hard to carry on like this
When sadness keeps on devouring me

I am my Inner Enemy
The only one I canât defeat
My deadly foe, my archenemy
All the time itâs me versus me
I am my Inner Enemy
The only one I canât defeat

In my nightmares I always lose

Now Iâm back on the road again
Too many miles of sorrow under my wheels
Hours become days as they turn blue to gray
I donât have the right to complain
âCos this is the path that Iâve chosen
Always feeling selfish because Iâve got it all
Trapped in a circle of melancholy
And I canât take no more

You are the only one that will never disappoint me
The only one that will never leave me
Guide me through this sea of sadness
Iâve always known youâre my true love

I am my Inner Enemyâ¦

Donât you hear my call?
Iâm helpless
If I ever meant anything for you
Please, heal me!
