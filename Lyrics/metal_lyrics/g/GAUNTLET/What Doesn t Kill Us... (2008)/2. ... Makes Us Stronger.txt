Overwhelming pile of doubts âround my head
Barbed-wire scarf too tight on my neck
Running barefoot in a field of broken glass 
Along the coldest river I swim against the tide

Working hard, the best I can, but that is not enough
Eaten up with anger and things you canât control
Everything is telling me Iâm in the wrong direction
But Iâm not like the ones who yield to awkward situations

Clench your fist and show your teeth
We wonât give in, we still resist

You hit us once... you hit us twice
We can bleed, but we donât change our minds
If youâre going through hell, just keep going
What doesnât kill us... makes us stronger!

I can hear the children of the fascists
Instructing me in democracy
On the other side, betrayers selling out 
They stole our parentsâ dreams

You so-called our politics, youâre not representing me
Wasting all our time discussing âbout frontiers
Hard times for everyone but it could be even worse
Lucky to be born in the First-fucking-World

The same olâ shit on my TV
Hypocrisy itâs all I see

You hit us once... you hit us twice
We can bleed, but we donât change our minds
You should know, as we get older
What doesnât kill us... makes us stronger!

Sometimes you donât know where you are
Caught in the middle of your life
You hold your breath with all your might
Under a storm of sharpened knives

You hit us once... you hit us twice
We can bleed, but we donât change our minds
My hopes and bones are almost broken
What doesnât kill us... 
Makes us stronger!
