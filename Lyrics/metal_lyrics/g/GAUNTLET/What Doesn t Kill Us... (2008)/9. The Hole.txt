The straw that breaks the camelâs back
Blood stains on broken glass
Primal reactions I canât repress
Refresh the demon again and again and again...

Down in the basement I shut my wrath away 
But thereâs no more room in this rusty cage
Like a pressure cooker where my air is getting thin
The air is getting thin

Storming around the place 
Gritting teeth, cursing under my breath
I feel better if I hurt myself
Iâm still searching for the hole
Where all my anger began to flow
Itâs an ugly trip inside
Iâm afraidâ¦ I know just what Iâll find

Thereâs something here that isnât right
I donât wanna hurt you
I donât want to see you cry
Hidden in a corner, my hands cover my face
I must admit that I need help

Down in the basement I shut my wrath away 
But thereâs no more room in this rusty cage
Like a pressure cooker where my air is getting thin
The air is getting thin

Storming around the place 
Gritting teeth, cursing under my breath
I feel better if I hurt myself
Iâm still searching for the hole
Where all my anger began to flow
Itâs an ugly trip inside
Iâm afraidâ¦ I know just what Iâll find

Angry for this, angry for that
I am done for, thereâs no turning back
In my mouth a bitter taste
Molotov cocktails to quench my thirst
