I donât know how it begun
Were you an insecure boy?
Did the other children treat you like a broken toy?
You saw the force in them
And all your fear became hate
Blaming everyone, the easy way

In hell a madman smiles
His crop is feeding mankind

All of us feel the fear sometimes
Bearing the rage inside
I can´t conceive whatâs wrong with you
What the hell are you trying to prove?
Sowing the seeds of hate
Seeds of hate 

You show emblems you donât understand
You cover your face and skin
I believe your soul is rotten and mean
Alone you have no guts
Without your legion of clones
Youâre nothinâ but the Dead Manâs puppet

In hell a madman smiles
His crop is feeding mankind

All of us feel the fear sometimes
Bearing the rage inside
I canÂ´t conceive whatâs wrong with you
What the hell are you trying to prove?
Sowing the seeds of hate
Seeds of hate 

Hate!
