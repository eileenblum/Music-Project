Oh, say can you see
By the dawnâs early light
We, Defenders of the Earth
For Liberty we have to fight

I pledge allegiance to my guns
And my justice ainât for all
We build the Empire, full of pride
We got The Almighty on our side, yeah!

In the name of (      )
All in Thy name

Non-believers be prepared
We bring the hell upon your race
This is the Book, guidance sure
Slay you all in Holy War 

We teach our people how to die
They will rest in paradise
Shed our blood for The Mission
Beat the world into submission

In the name of (      )
All in Thy name

You and I know we could live in peace 
Despite our different minds 
Tell me you donât want to see 
Your children playing free with mine

In the name of (      )
All in Thy name
