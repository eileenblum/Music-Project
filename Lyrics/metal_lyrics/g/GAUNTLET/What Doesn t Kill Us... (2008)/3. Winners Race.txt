Ready, steady... go!!!

âCome along, children!
Have a good time with this race!
Where the first prize is a shattered life!â

Get rid of your innocence 
And now youâre ready for success
Your bloody parents will be proud
If you take part in this event

Enjoy a golf game with your brand new friends
Where no one cares if you canât play
See a fashion rock show, be a rebel for a day 
Change your expensive suit for a Rolling Stones t-shirt

Just walk the road they set for you
Beware of getting lost
In the Winners Race 
You are the number one
Menâs envy, high-class whores
Pats on the back and high-class drugs
You hold yourself in high esteem
But not so far is your fall

You have no time to lose
This is an offer you canât refuse
If you crush each other, 
You must have good values

Passing all the pricks at full speed
Reflection of your personality
You donât get along with anybody
Itâs something that you canât conceive
Treading on the others to make it to the top in the firm

Just walk the road they set for youâ¦

Your pretty girl is just for show
Does she really start you up?
Who cares? 
Sheâs the perfect daughter-in-law 

Just walk the road they set for youâ¦

Canât stand the loneliness 
Thereâs nobody by your side
Those little things you miss now
Never again in your life

You wanna burn your land cruiser
You donât give a shit âbout your loot
Your artificial family
Expected nothinâ but welfare from you
