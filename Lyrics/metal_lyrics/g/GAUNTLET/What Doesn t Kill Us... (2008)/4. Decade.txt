Face down in the mud
Itâs not the first time, sure wonât be the last
Stand the fuck up once again  
And thereâs nothinâ more to say

Gathering my teeth up off the floor
I spit out the blood, Iâm coming back for moreâ¦ yeah
I have kissed the hard cold ground a thousand times before

The fire remains intact
We can feel it burn inside
Fan the flame and keep it up!

All the sweat &amp; sacrifice is just a matter of pride
I just want to stand right here for all my goddamn life
Itâs hard to walk this road 
But I sure know itâs worth fighting for

Back in â98, when we were born
We were determined to bang down every fuckinâ door
As years go by, we came across the thickest walls
Yes, we kickâem harder âcos we have not had enough

We are the ones who have the right to say how hard it is
We have gone through shit
But itâs the price for livinâ on a will

The fire remains intactâ¦

All the sweat &amp; sacrificeâ¦

All the sweat &amp; sacrifice is just a matter of pride
I just want to stand right here for all my goddamn life
I just want to stand right here
Never thought of givinâ up
I just want to shout it loud and clear
