The gods in man's form have descended on our lands
We received them with arms wide open and offering our wealth
And without provocation they took all our possessions
With the benediction of their kings, in the name of a god and a nation

How dare you judge me as a savage?
I adore the Sun, the Rain and the Stars that guide my way
Use my blood to wash away the white manâs sins
I wonât reject my beliefs for two crossed woods that mean nothing to me

Our paradise has turned to hell
No mercy, no justice
Under The Cross of Shame
Black Legend spreads like disease
Murder and death walk everywhere
Under the shadow of The Cross of Shame

The convicts of your bulging prisons stand out in our fields
You razed our culture to the ground; you changed our gold into misery 

An empire built with greed and pride
Converting by fire and sword 
In the New World heads are rolling 
While in Europe people burn!

Our paradise has turned to hell
No mercy, no justice
Under The Cross of Shame
Black Legend spreads like disease
Murder and death walk everywhere
Under the shadow of The Cross of Shame
