Dead man talking!

I have known you forever
I haven't met you today
You're fucking running off at the mouth
Each and every day

You are in way under your head
Just back up a bit
You ain't the first, nor will be the last
I don't take no shit

I just got you up my ass
You cloud my judgement
Cut the crap
Beware of geeks bearing gifts
The same old tale
You live, you learn
My only silence...
My dying breath!

Revolting flies hovering around me
Filthy parasites
Blabbermouths rule this country
Great spirits have always encountered
Violent opposition from mediocre minds

I don't wash your back so you'll stab mine
That's what I expect
Just a prick playing with his own rules
You're a fucking jerk
