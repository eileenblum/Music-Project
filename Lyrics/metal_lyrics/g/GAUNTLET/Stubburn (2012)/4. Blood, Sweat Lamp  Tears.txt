Evil has landed on this sacred ground
Greed has come even to innocents' town
The Devil in angelÂ´s disguise
All of 'em dance to the music of his wrath
Divide and rule is once more his game
What's in everyoneÂ´s mind, nobody dares to say

You bastards!
Of your own medicine you should get a taste
You cowards!

He pulls the strings in his puppet show
All must pray to the speechless lord
Hard on your heels he'll send his hound dogs
Down on your knees or the exit door is closed

You bastards!
Of your own medicine you should get a taste
You cowards!
May justice, but not yours, condemn you to hell

What I have seen... your rotten soul
What I have done... work 'til I drop

Nothing was enough those years
All my blood I bled for you
Lying in a pool of sweat and tears
Nothing was enough those years
All my blood I bled for you
I have no regrets at all
And I have no fear

[Lead: Aitor Gorosabel]

[Chorus]

All my blood I bled
All my blood I bled
