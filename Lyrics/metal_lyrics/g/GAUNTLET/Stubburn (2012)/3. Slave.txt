Same ol' wounds left to heal deep inside
Same ol' fears numb my mind one more time
In the darkest cell I hide behind the pain
Anxiety grabs my neck and never goes away
Feel like there's no turning back when blue gives way to black
I'm headed for another fall

I keep on fighting every day
No more wasted yesterdays
No more
I'm not afraid of being afraid
This time I'm sure I want to change
I am not my own slave

Into the river I dive
It feels good bathing in the purple light
Hand on heart, I pray for myself
I swear you tomorrow I will be alright

[Lead: Miguel]

[Chorus]

It's never too late to change my ways
I welcome a new dawn
With a smile on my face
Now that I've learned
Yesterday's dead
I am not my own slave
