We've never seen the axe ate away by rust
And we still hear the snake crawling in the grass
No way! We're not gonna trust
Three white shadows that hide beneath a mask

Elimination to build a pure nation
Your childish fascist dream
You turned the greenest meadows
In fucking killing fields

You talk 'bout confrontation
But tiny general's uniform
Was devoured by the maggots
More than thirty years ago

Now you cleanse the blood
From your red stained souls
As if nothing would have happened before

Do you want us to forget?
Do you want us to forgive?
Without regrets there's no redemption
There will be no peace

You demand generosity
From a shattered society
How much damage done in vain
You've been losing your own game
I'd like to meet you face to face
And shoot these words at point blank range
This is coming to an end
You've been digging your own grave

[Lead: Miguel]

Until the day justice is done
Until we've cried a million tears
In the hearts of the wounded
There will be no peace
