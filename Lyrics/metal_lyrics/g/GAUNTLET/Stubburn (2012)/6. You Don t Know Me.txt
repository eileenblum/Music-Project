I am your deepest desire
The one you cannot reach
The passion beyond the fire
Every man's dream

A hope dressed in black
I'll promise you the Earth
Night after night, day after day
Hunting the prey

Walking into walls
So much time, so alone

You don't know me
You don't know who I am
Don't think you hold my reins

I am the perfect victim
Hanging it every day
My little piece of heaven
Is turning now into hell

Sticking my head in the sand
Trying to get me out of my mind
Ripped to the bone, I stand on the edge
Taught to survive

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Lead: Dani]

[Chorus]

You don't know me
You just don't know
Your end move is done

You let this good thing die
