[Intro lead: Dani]

You got me since the first time
More than a fantasy
You were a gift from heaven
An angel sent to me
Someone to rely on
The one that I've been waiting for so long

The road is tougher than it seems
But say my name and I'll be there
Every day you can depend on me
Every day until the bitter end

I've been praying for you
My arms are open wide
But it's hard to carry on
When fear is stronger than love

Everything is over now
It's vanishing into the air
I've been alone before
But never this way
I would be forever yours
If I could live on empty promises

In the longest days when hope is gone
In the endless nights when all is lost
May Lord make that storm clouds rain
To wash my pain away

I've been praying for you
My arms are open wide
But it's hard to carry on...
I have sold my soul for you
For a dream that won't come true
I have sold my soul
For a love I'll never know

I tried my best to keep
Your demons out of your head
I tried to help you
But you ran away from me again

[Chorus]
