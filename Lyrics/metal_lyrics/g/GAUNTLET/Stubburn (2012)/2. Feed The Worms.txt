I'm not sure I want to write this
As I burn my soul to ashes
I'm writhing in my own shit
Yes, I'm writhing in my own shit
I'll get rid of all this madness
Diving in a lake of sadness

I feel safe out in the cold
You're not there, I'm all alone

When everything is said and done
Don't tell me who was wrong
I always cared but now
Honey, I don't want to know
Like a vomit on the ground
Like a dead dog on the road
Let my body rot
For all my guts can feed the worms

Goddamn, I just can't find
Where and when we broke the ties
Things were good before the lies
Things were good before the lies
What the hell was on our minds?
What have we done with our lives?

In your arms I used to cry
But my tears now have gone dry

[Chorus]

I just want to disappear
Kill this pain and fly away

[Lead: Ix Valieri]

[Chorus]

Like a postcard buried in the sand
Like a promise when you're drunk
All our rusted memories
Can't evoke forgotten words
My journey ends right here
But yours has just begun
Let my body rot in peace
And all my guts will feed the worms
My guts will feed the worms
All my guts feed the worms
