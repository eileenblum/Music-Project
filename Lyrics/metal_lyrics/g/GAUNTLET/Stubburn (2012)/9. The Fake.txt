Lack of personality
Puppet dancing on a string
Carried away by the mainstream
You're in every TV show
Brand new look and rebel pose

Nice guitar... Let me hear...
You can't play a fuckin' lick!
But it looks cool in the magazines
Wearing t-shirts of classic bands
You've never listened to before

Open up your ear
There's a thing that you should know
You can't make a silk purse
When your house is full of sows

Dressed up like a crow
Trying out a cold-ass stare
But now it's time to hit the stage and
You're nothin' but a f-f-f-f fake!

Oh no! You again
I watch your video everyday
But I can't hear those Marshalls anyway
You can shred! Bang your head!
And please, be careful
Be careful with your neck

You're authentic, tell the world
That you love Rock'n'Roll
As you've been already told
Honesty and attitude
The main difference between me and you

Listen up here
There's a thing that you should know
You can't make a silk purse
When your house is full of sows

[Chorus]

The latest fashion nowadays
Yeah, you think you're all the rage
My middle finger in your face 'cause
You're nothin' but a fake!

Not for the money not for the fame
It's all about feeling good with yourself
For you it's hard to understand
Love for music ain't for sale

[Lead: Miguel]

You should hear me when I say
You have lost your fuckin' way
'Cause tomorrow you'll deny
What you're tryin' to be today

[Outro lead: Manuel Seoane]
