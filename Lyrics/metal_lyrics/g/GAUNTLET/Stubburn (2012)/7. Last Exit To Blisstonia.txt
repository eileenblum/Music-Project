Many years have passed by since Octagon,
Our beloved, withdrew from his shining throne
Head out to Blisstonia, hit the road
We can't trace any ciphering lights from above

"Bring Claudius back to life and he will reign"
Is the browser's revelation
But thirty shekels and his good name
Is not enough for an emperor's salvation

The golden bug, you fools
Was hidden in the skull

When the laser has its eye on you
And you feel your mind is breakin' loose
Curving everything, deny the line
Gods n' monsters 'round your head
A scary way to face our death

[Lead: Dani / Miguel]

United States of Globex Crisis Council
Is gathered searching for solutions
They say: "The quest for a shrubbery and a shoe
Can guide our souls to raise a revolution"

If I gave my eyes and I couldn't see
Better to sail away and maybe rest in peace

[Chorus]
