I am alive 
Not on the brink 
But people think 
I am extinct 
Don't write me off 
Or even think 
I don't exist 
I'm not extinct 
I stand alone in many ways 
Evolving from a different race 
I have a name I have a face 
And I'm still breathing 
Endangered species are it's said 
A little rare - I'm not dead yet 
Don't strike me off your list just yet 
Cos I'm still breeding 
Gone but not for good and you bet 
I'll resurrect again 
I am alive 
Not on the brink 
But people think 
I am extinct 
Don't write me off 
Or even think 
I don't exist 
I'm not extinct 
One of a kind but I am not 
Just a statistic in your book 
There may be just a few of us 
But I'm still living 
Invisible to many eyes 
It may then come as some surprise 
Re-energised I will arise 
Hey! I'm not finished 
Gone but not for good and you bet 
I'll resurrect again 
I am alive 
Not on the brink 
But people think 
I am extinct 
Don't write me off 
Or even think 
I don't exist 
I'm not extinct 
I won't fade away 
I'm staying 
I refuse to be endangered 
I'll protect my reputation 
That of living not forgetting 
I am indestructible 
I'm made like you of flesh and blood 
I'm not a fossil etched in stone  
I am alive I'm not alone 
Prehistoric I never was 
I'm made like you of flesh and blood 
Unlike the dinosaur I'm not 
About to perish 
I walk this earth 
Alongside God 
I asked "Man am I done?" 
He looked at me 
He said "Live on 
You won't get damaged" 
I am alive 
Not on the brink 
But people think 
I am extinct 
Don't write me off 
Or even think 
I don't exist 
I'm not extinct 
I am alive 
Not on the brink 
But people think 
I am extinct 
Don't write me off 
Or even think 
I don't exist 
I'm not extinct 
I am alive 
Not on the brink 
But people think 
I am extinct 
Don't write me off 
Or even think 
I don't exist 
I'm not extinct
