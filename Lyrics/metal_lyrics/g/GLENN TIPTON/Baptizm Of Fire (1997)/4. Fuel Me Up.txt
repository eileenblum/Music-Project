Don't pass me by 
Without a drop 
Just step across 
And fill my cup 
Gimme more 
It's not enough 
Rejuvenate me 
Fuel me up 
Running drier 
Every day 
Low on gas 
High on octane 
See the needle 
Running hot 
Once you start 
It's hard to stop 
Galvanise me 
To the spot 
Immunise me with 
Everything you've got 
Don't pass me by 
And never stop 
Step across and  
Fill my cup 
Gimme more 
It's not enough 
Rejuvenate me 
Fuel me up 
Are you big enough 
To take it 
Cos now you'll pay 
Pick me up if 
I fall I just need 
Some more fuel 
Don't you understand 
My need creates demand 
Running drier 
Every day 
Low on gas 
High on octane 
See the needle 
Running hot 
Once you start 
It's hard to stop 
Galvanise me 
To the spot 
Better give me  
Everything you've got 
Don't pass me by 
Without a drop 
Just step across 
And fill my cup 
Gimme more 
It's not enough 
Rejuvenate me 
Fuel me up 
Don't preach to me 
I wont O.D. 
You talk too much 
Shut the fuck up 
And fuel me up 
I never stop 
I wouldn't last 
I'd never rock
