As I lie awake in the morning 
Just killing time 
I can feel the pain and the torment 
Building up inside my mind 
Have to get it under the counter 
Stop myself from going blind 
An excess is what I'm after 
Nothing less will satisfy 
So I walk the streets 
And I search beneath 
The cloak of decency that hides 
All that I need 
On which I feed 
Better give me 
Hard Core 
And so the urge returns again 
Hard Core 
Only thing to ease the pain 
Lipsmacking magazine when you're younger 
Hidden in my desk at school 
Big appetite increases the hunger 
Now I need it more and more 
Gimme little something to take until daybreak 
Or I will go insane 
It's building in me, need relief 
You better give me  
Hard Core 
Speak to me of things I like 
Hard Core 
Nothing less will satisfy 
Oh they lie to me 
So it's time to be on my way 
Speak of love but say 
We are way ahead of this place 
So so - so frustrated 
Never naked - never betrayed 
So so - so frustrated 
Never naked - never betrayed 
Take it to the limit 
I admit it you know 
Yes I couldn't give a damn 
Oh is it any wonder 
That I hunger 
Just can't give me 
Hard core 
Seeping back into my brain 
Hard core 
The only thing to ease my pain 
Hard core 
Get it while you can 
Experience it every day 
Hard core 
You want it bad you better pay 
Fax phone line just wanna flick through 
Anytime cataloguing while I kinda change 
I'm gonna order mine this time and 
I'm gonna watch you viewing behind a mirror 
Looking I'm out there ... do it 
Hard core 
Feel the need to return again 
Hard core 
Nothing less will ease the pain 
Hard core 
Hard core
