You can hear the thunder in the sky 
I can see the fire in your eyes 
Don't you even think that you can hide 
You're the same flesh and blood as I 
Damn the very day that we were born 
In the centre of the electric storms 
We will never see the light of sun 
Cursed forever by the hand of God 
Fear is the only friend of mine 
Excuse me while I step out of the light 
We will only see the dead of night 
I'm a voodoo brother 
You're the next in line 
Got a voodoo mother 
Just the same as mine 
Gonna live forever 
But your soul is lost like mine 
On the day we die 
Voodoo brother 
Voodoo mother-father 
Damn the very day that we were born 
In the centre of the electric storms 
Fear is the only friend of mine 
Excuse me while I step out of the light 
We will only see the dead of night 
I'm a voodoo brother 
You're the next in line 
Got a voodoo mother 
Just the same as mine 
Gonna live forever 
But your soul is lost like mine 
On the day we die 
Stepped into volcanic rage 
Spoke to voices from another age 
Walked across atomic plains 
Never to return this way again 
I'm a voodoo brother 
You're the next in line 
Got a voodoo mother 
Just the same as mine 
Gonna live forever 
But your soul is lost like mine 
On the day we die 
I'm a voodoo brother 
Got a voodoo mother 
I'm a voodoo brother 
You're the next in line 
Got a voodoo mother 
Just the same as mine 
I'm a voodoo brother 
Got a voodoo mother
