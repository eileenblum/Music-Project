You can live your life of ease 
If you obey the hierarchy 
I never could see, I never knew why 
I shouldn't stand and speak my mind 
You keep your mouth shut and your ok 
You get to live through one more day 
But I had to say this 
And I had to say that 
And they stuck a knife right in my back 
Closed the lid to bury me 
But while there's still 
A breath of life in me 
Left me for dead 
But there's no way that I 
Will ever give in 
I will survive 
Traitors prosper, rebels die 
And then they say 
He was no friend of mine 
Oh I never say no when I want to say yes 
I never go along and vote for the obvious 
Just because of my 
Point of view 
My expiry date's long overdue 
Oh you never can tell 
What's going on in their minds 
They write your death warrant 
But return your smile 
While there's still a breath in me 
I will not lie down 
They won't get me 
Left me for dead 
There's no way that I 
Will ever give in 
I will survive 
I will survive 
While there's still a breath in me 
I won't lie down 
They won't get me 
Left me for dead 
There's no way that I 
Will ever give in 
I will survive 
While there's still a breath in me 
I won't lie down 
They won't get me
