I see a red door  
And I want to paint it black 
No colours anymore 
I want them to turn black 
I see a line of cars 
And they are painted black 
They pass me by with one 
Who's never coming back 
I look inside myself 
And see my heart is black 
I see a red door  
And I have to have it black 
Maybe I'll fade away 
And not have to face the fact 
That it's not easy 
When your whole world's turning black 
Paint it black 
My world's black 
If we look hard enough 
Into the setting sun 
These things will last with me 
Before the morning comes 
I see them walking by 
All dressed up in their clothes 
I have to turn away 
Until my blackness goes 
Paint it black 
My world's black 
Paint it black 
It's all black
