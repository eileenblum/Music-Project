[Japan Bonus Track]

Cities in the sky
Secrets locked inside great minds
Hold answers to all the mysteries of time
Walk amongst the clouds
Listen to the mountain sounds
Speak gigaically
And tell me how it ought to be
Awake inside 
Learn that you can find 
Every single thing
You ever left behind you
Look into the sun
Raise your voice and say
Oh! Oh!
You gave me strength
And Killed me fear
You answered my prayer
Himalaya
We who know it all 
Simply decided to ignore
For a million years 
All wisdom leaving here
On Tibetan nights
If you reach up you can touch the sky 
As the changing light
Guides you to another life
Another road
As the vision holds
Take in what you can
Regain possession of your soul
Raise your voice and shout
Let it echo out
Oh! Oh!
You gave me strength
And killed my fear
You answered my prayer
Himalaya
I came for help
in deep despair
You answered my prayer
Himalaya
I want to be near you
Time standing still just for me
I want to be near you
I want to be here
You gave me strength
And killed my fear
You answered my fear
Himalaya
I came for help
In deep despair
You answered my prayers
Himalaya
You gave me hope ( You gave me hope)
When no one cared
You'll always be there
Himalaya
