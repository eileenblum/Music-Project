It depends on your point of view 
I'm a healer 
I can heal you 
If you're skeptical no can do 
If you're a believer 
I can heal you 
Run out of remedies as others do 
Then come to me 
I will heal you 
I'll take your pain away  
Then give to you 
A new beginning 
If you want me to 
Stand in line 
Tell me what's wrong 
I'll give you faith 
And I'll make you strong 
Come here close to me 
Feel my energy 
Put your trust in me 
I can heal you 
Look at me 
And you'll begin to recognise reality 
Sickness lives only in your mind 
Look at me 
Give yourself completely 
Look at me 
Trust in me 
Look at me 
I can heal you 
"Save me" 
I can hear you say 
Heal me 
Take my pain away 
Stand in line 
Tell me what's wrong 
Give me strength 
And I'll turn the heat on 
Come here close to me 
And feel my energy 
Put your trust in me 
I can heal 
Come up close to me 
Feel my energy 
Put your trust in me 
I can heal you 
Come up close to me 
Feel the power in me 
Believe me - I'll heal you 
Come up close to me 
Change your destiny 
Trust me - I'll heal you
