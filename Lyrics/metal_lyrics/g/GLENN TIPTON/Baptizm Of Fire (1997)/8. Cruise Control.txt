Sinking 
I'm sinking deeper every day 
I don't care 
I don't care 
I'm outta here 
Seems to me it's time to taste 
Some different air 
And get outta here 
Caughtup in the routines 
Really nothing much to loose 
So risk it all and 
Just cut loose 
Put your life in cruise control 
Set your course and let it go 
And you 
Might find a better way 
Tomorrows looking pretty grey 
Say a prayer 
Cos I've been there 
About as welcome as acid rain 
So do you dare 
Get outta there 
Never take a look back 
Never say that it's too late 
Pull the plug 
On yesterday 
Put yourself in cruise control 
Set your course and let it go 
And you 
Might just find a better way 
Never take a look back 
Never say that it's too late 
Step on the gas 
Accelerate 
Choking 
Set your course and let it go 
Put your life in cruise control 
Set your course and let it go
