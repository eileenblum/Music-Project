You can be immortal
You can carve your name on the edge of time
You can live forever
Never say die

You can be immortal
You can be around till the end of time
You can make your lifetime
One of a kind

Too many stars that never shine
Too many crash and burn
Too many ships that sank in the night
And never sail again

You can re-write history
In a thousand years they'll still say your name
And the unbelievers
You can blow away

Too many stars that never shine
Too many crash and burn
Too many ships that sank in the night
And never sail again

But I'm going to live
Till the end of time
I can walk through fire
And never say die

You can be immortal
You can carve your name on the edge of time
You can live forever
Never say die

But I'm going to live -till the end of time
I can walk through fire
And never say die

I'm going to live for the rest of time
I can walk on water
'cause I never say die

I can walk through the gates of hell
I spit fire and I live to tell

I can fly can't you see
I'm going to be around - be around
Forever - I'm never going to die
I can be immortal
And never say die

I'm going to live for the rest of time
I can be immortal
And never say die
