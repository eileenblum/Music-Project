Give blood
I want blood

Nobody moves me the way you do
I hear your sycophants tell you
Same old stories might have known
Your deception meets an all time low

Oh! this time your crimes
Finally caught up with you
Oh! you bet you'll get
Everything coming to you

[Chorus:]
Don't ask me show pity
As if I would
I want blood

You can scream or plead for mercy
It's not enough
Give blood

Well stick around
It could be fun
I got the bullets
You got the gun
They pull the trigger
When I explain
Vengeance is beautiful
Such a shame

Escape too late
Let's see what you're gonna do
Oh! witness your grip
Loosen as they turn on you

Don't ask me to show pity
As if I would
I want blood
You can scream and plead for mercy
It's not enough give blood

Oh! I'll break down your door
Give blood

Oh! I'm gonna get to you
Don't you remember my name
I'm sure it will come to you

Escape too late
Let's see what you're going to do
You cna bet you'll get
Everything coming to you

[Chorus]

I'm only mortal
But I will force you to
Kick down the doors until
You give blood

Revenge is sweet enough
But nowhere near enough
I want back what you took
Give blood

I want blood
Oh! when I could I would
Give blood

I want back what you took
I want blood
