When I was young and alive
Just looking for ways to survive
I never did quite realise
How time eats away at your life

Now I am older for sure
And close to the end of it all
So I reflect with hindsight
Sitting alone every night

And I was desperate to find
The things I have here by my side
Now that I've let it all go
I cry for the children so

And I've spent all my life
Searching for nothing
And I've wasted my time
To end up with nothing

And I tried so hard to understand
The yearnings of a younger man
I know that I would change my plans
If I could take my time again

When I was young and alive
Just looking for ways to survive
I never did quite realise
How time eats away at your life

I have spent all my life
Searching for nothing
And I wasted my time
And it's all come to nothing
When I was young and alive
I needed nothing
Now I am ready to die
I've still got nothing
