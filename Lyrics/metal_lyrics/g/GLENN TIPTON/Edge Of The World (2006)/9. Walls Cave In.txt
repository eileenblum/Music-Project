They pound their fists
Upon your door
They want your blood
And you know what for

You tried to say
You got suckered in
Each new excuse
Is wearing thin

Suddenly out of the blue
You changed your colours now
Look at you

You don't talk so loud
Now your luck's run out
You got to the top and
There's no way down

Oh! you better stay alive
But you are running out of time

Just when you think you'll win
Well think again - the walls cave in
Oh! you thought you'd won the fight
And then - the walls cave in

Just you and me
And me and you
Face to face
Are gonna see it though

You're gonna choke and they broke your will
And their moving in now
They sense a kill

Your gonna lose
You got it wrong
So don't pretend to sing
A different song

You're under attack
And the odds are stacked
And there's no escape
There's no way back

You're always gonna lose
Too late - you had your chance to choose

Just when you think you'll win
Well think again - the walls cave in
Oh! you're gonna pay the price
And it's down to just me and you

Oh! the bigger that you are
They say the harder that you fall

Just when you think you'll win
Well think again
The walls cave in

When you got a grip on victory
Just let it slip
Just as you think that you
Will take the prize
You always lose
Oh! when you think that you will win
The walls cave in
