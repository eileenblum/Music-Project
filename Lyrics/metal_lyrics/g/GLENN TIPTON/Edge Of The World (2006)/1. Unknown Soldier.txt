They came for me at night
When I couldn't stand the pain
Sent me at first light
I was never seen again
They told so many lies
Which I never could explain
A few good men must die I know
A sacrifice I made
But that's ok
Until they put me in an unknown grave
And the men that put me there
Took my name away
