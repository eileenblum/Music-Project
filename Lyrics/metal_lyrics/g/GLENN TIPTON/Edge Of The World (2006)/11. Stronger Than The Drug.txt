Sent me to see if I can do some good
'cause you can depend on it
To poison your blood
Pay with your life
You disagree
Nothing comes easy
Nothing is free

Oh! my life
Such a cold, cold night

Don't let me down
Don't do it this time
Got enough reasons
Still got enough time
Wasting away
Got to come through
Nothing achieved
Yet still got
So much to do

All my life
Living through a cold, cold night
Just like you
I've got too much to lose

Had enough
Lord above
Keep telling me
I'm stronger than the drug

Saw a light shine
From above and I
Knew right away
I'm stronger than the drug

Got to get away
Where there's a will there's a way
And it bothers me
The state you're in
Wasted dreams

And I know it's true
You live a lie
Just look at you

And I can't explain
The way I feel
The change is strange

I've had enough
Lord above
Keep telling me
I'm stronger than the drug

Saw a light shine
From above and I
Knew that I'me
Stronger than the drug

You will lose
Have to say
That you came from nowhere
Got back that way

I refuse to
Just because you do
I've had enough
Say
I'm stronger than the drug

Say it
Say it
Say it

Stronger than the drug

Stronger than the drug

Stronger than the drug

Stronger than the drug

Say it
