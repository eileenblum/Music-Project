The holy man's coming
Knocking on my door
Don't let him in
I committed no sin
I don't need no help at all

The holy man's come in
Stepped into my room
Turned on the light
In the middle of the night
He said god will see me soon
He's telling me that heaven waits
And this is where I'll go
The doctor said I will not die
There's something I don't know

Too young to die
Don't ask me why
The holy man's coming in
Somebody better help me

The holy man's come in
Standing by my bed
He seems in a hurry
So don't tell me not to worry
I must be close to dead

Holy man

The holy man's coming
Can anybody hear
He stinks of gin - I didn't ask him in
Somebody get him out of here
He put his hands upon my head
The time has come he said
I hate to break the news
He's a bit confused
I'm not quite ready yet

Got a cross in his hand
I don't understand
The holy man's coming
Somebody better help me

The holy man's come in
Standing by my bed
He seems in a hurry
Don't tell me not to worry
I must be close to dead

Said I won't make it
Through the night
Said I won't see the morning light

There's a man in the next room worse than me
So what the hell's he doing in here with me

The holy man's coming
Praying for my soul
I tried to let him know
He can have it if he'll go
And leave me alone

The holy man's coming
Kneeling by my bed
The holy man's coming
Don't tell me not to worry
I must be close to dead
