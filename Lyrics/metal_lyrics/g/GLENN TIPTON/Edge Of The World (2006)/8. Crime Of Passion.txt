In my dreams
I don't feel pain
Only when I wake up again
Seems to me it's such a shame
One crime of passion
Had to take the blame

I can see yet I am blind
And now I have to leave this world behind

The sun's gone down
For one last time
When morning comes
I'll pay a terrible price
Remember me
For what it was like
The sun's gone down
On my life

Can you see a blood red sun
Can you smell
Smoke from a gun
Do you recall
What words were said
We had to listen
Well we won't again

As the night goes by I find I'm running out of time
They will not even let me say goodbye

The sun's gone down
For one last time
When morning comes
I'll pay a terrible price
Remember me
And what it was like
The sun's gone down
One last time

I can see yet I was blind
And now I have to leave this world behind

The suns gone down
For one last time
When morning comes
I'll pay a terrible price
Remember me for what it was like
The sun's gone down on my life
