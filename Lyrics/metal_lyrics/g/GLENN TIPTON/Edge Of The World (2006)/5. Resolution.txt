We didn't start it
Or firearm it
Better call in the U.N. to disarm it
Ceasefire
Tell the snipers
Cause you're dealing with a bunch of fucking liars
Streetfighter
Outsider
But they're never going to take it from us
We believe it
'cause you dream it
One day you'll realise we mean it

Oh! in the night, when the wind and rain
Puts out the flame
The morning sun warms up the blood
And the candle burns again

My resolution is getting strong
I feel so good now I know where I am going
My resolution gives me the power
To get back on my feet when they knock me to the ground

Unify it, don't try it
Just another sell and we won't buy it
Peace treaties are in pieces
You can see it everyday on the tv
They fly around and say they're making cround
But put your money on another breakdown
The real war is right here with us
And it's going to go on and on and on

Oh! in the night when the wind and rain
Puts out the flame
The morning sun warms up the blood
And the candle burns again

My resolution
Is getting strong
I suddenly believe in what I'm doing
My resolution won't go away
I feel it growing stonger everyday

On our way
To change the course of history &amp; time
We shall try
To reach inside and find a strength of mind
Who wants war?

Oh! in the night when the wind and rain
Puts out the flame
The morning sun warms up the blood
And the candle burns again

My resolution is getting strong
I suddenly believe in what I'm doing
My resolution gives me the power
To get back on my feet when they kick me to the ground
My resolution won't go away
I feel it growing stronger day by day
My resolution will never die
My contribution could be my life
