Have you ever been
Very near to where
The beams of the sun meet the atmosphere

Have you ever flown
Through the frozen spray
Of niagra falls on a winter's day

Have you ever swum
Where the sea turns black
And been in danger from a shark attack

Have you ever been on the brink of death
But returned to tell
What others guess

If you think these things absurd
You've never been to the edge of the world

I have been there
I have searched
And I found what I'm looking for - at the edge of the world
I have wondered
'cause I heard
You can find what you're looking for - at the edge of the world

Have you ever seen
Through an eagles eye
A total eclipse from way up high

Have you ever come across
A lost empire
Or walked the desert for a thousand miles

Have you ever stood on mount everest
Left your footprints there
Did you pass that test

Have you ever past close to the gates of hell
Have you walked that road
Yes I know it well

If you don't believe a word
You've never been to the edge of the world

I have seen this
I have searched
I have found what I'm looking for
At the edge of the world

I have wondered
'cause I heard
You can find what you're looking for
At the edge of the earth

Have you ever tried to find
The inside of your mind
Crossed to the other side
And spoke with other kinds

Have you been there
Have you searched
'cause you can find what you're looking for
At the edge of the... earth

Have you wandered
Far and wide
You can live out all your dreams
If you only try

I have been there
I have searched
And I found what I'm looking for - at the edge of the world

I have wondered
'cause I heard
You can find what you're looking for
At the edge of the world
