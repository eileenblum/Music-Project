Oh so young and far from home
They only get one life
They were told it's just a game
There woul dbe no need to fight

Seemed quite real though yesterday
When we got blown away
By friendly fire

Giving orders from afar
They're safe and sound who cares
If a few lives are expendable
As long as its' not theirs

Wonder would they say the same
If they got blown away
By friendly fire
By friendly fire

Sending back photographs of war
I thought you might need some of that
To remind you of what it is like
To be on the other side of
Friendly fire

They turn &amp; look away
As if they always knew
That all their empty words
Can't eclipse the truth - that's okay
Even if they'll never take the blame
At least put me to rest
Give me back my name

I wonder if they'd stillagree
To risk their life expectancy
If they'd been standing next to me
And blown away by friendly fire

By friendly fire
