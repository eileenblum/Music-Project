When I open the gates of the unseen
I will fall into the abyss of fire
when the day of sacrifice comes
I will know the mysteries of death

I drink the sacrificed blood
like poisoned win from grapes of sin
I'm the part of burning space
when men and women are the stars

The knowledge of ancient Celts
and power of tytanic thrones
these secrets will be seen for me
like drap of blood on crystal knife

There is no god in my Dark mind
I'm the heart of ancient Druid
I hold inside eternal flame
of nocturnal magic
