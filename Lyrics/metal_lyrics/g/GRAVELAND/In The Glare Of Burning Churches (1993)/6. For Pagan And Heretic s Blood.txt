They came from the south
in the sunshine
covered by black hoods
with the crosses in their hands
false sons of false god

They arose their black temples
burned forest and woods
placed the black crosses
and predered to worship dead
laying claim to rule sons
of laying claim to rule god

They drank his blood
they ate his flesh
scolfed at the right of nature
and raped the eternal right
sure of themselves sons
of the sure himself god
Possessed with crosses in hands
possessed with flabeau over the pyres
How much blood they have spilled

How much souls they have tormented
they burned the witches
murdered the Pagans
banished the honest spirits
choped the holy trees
condemned to madness sons
by their god usurper.
