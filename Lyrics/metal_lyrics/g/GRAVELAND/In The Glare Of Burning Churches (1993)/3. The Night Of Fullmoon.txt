Pagan country in the moonlight
witches calling for their Lord
incantation of the Darkside
from the book of secret world

Scream breaks off nocturnal silence
they begins the rite of Darkness

Hill in the fog
the heart of wood
altar of goat
infernal gloom
nocturnal rite
knife in the hand
worship Darkside
bless Left Hand Path

Pagans hidden in the forest
in unholy common grave

christians killed the last worshiper
but the Dark Cult is still living
I'm the son of a pagan nation
I got a part of secret knowledge
oh Lord I kneel before Thee
Darkness and Evil showed me thy name
I'm still waiting for thy return
The ancient cult will be again
here the god of war and pain.

Black the ultimate colour, darkness the only aim
evil the proper impulse, death the only mercy

Nothing was forgotten and nothing will be ever forgotten
all those who raised their swords against odious christianity
will live forever in dark legend
