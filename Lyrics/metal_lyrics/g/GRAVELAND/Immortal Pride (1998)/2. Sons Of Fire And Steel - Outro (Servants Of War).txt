Bloody red glow came into sight to brighten
Dance darkness of night up
Gods gave rise to a new war!

This was is not just a war
Today brothers kill each other!
Treason has reared itself a throne
Enemy poisoned our people's souls
By deceit and damnation...

Bloody glows brighten the night up
Echoes brought cry of dying men
We were looking and waiting
Ready to fight
Ready to inflict deadly blows!

Strange god brought treason
Poisinong hearts of many brave warriors!
Every day was bringing pain and disease
Dark clouds covered the sky

Wind brought smell of blood
Dark clouds covered moon up
Our hearts froze
We heard voices of death

Waiting for our day
We prepared sharp arrows and swords
Today Gods give us a sign :
We can take revenge now

Feeling cold touch of our swords
Enemy will learn what fear is
Let rivers of blood be our work

Strangers brought false faith
They turn against our native Gods
They will be damned forever
And their faith will burn with them in hell!

It is time to leave forest
Daybreak is coming
It is time to start a battle
Under a cover of mourning fog

I heard a voice talking to me :
Faithfulness is your honour
Songs of fire and steel
Never forget these words
