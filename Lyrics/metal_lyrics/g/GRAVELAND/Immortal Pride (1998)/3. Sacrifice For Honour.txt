Sit down brave warrior!
Your journey is finished
Now you do not have to
Be afraid of guileful foe
You are among old oaks
Protected by holy place

Look at bloody rivers
No rays from the sky come down
Birds do not build nests
Wolves eat rotting carcass
War everywhere!

Warmth of holy fire will heal your wonds
Fire's sheen will bring calm to your soul
Today you are in a holy forest
Where fire blazes fed blood and mead

Your women and children died
Fire destroyed your village
Don't think about pain
They are with you now, here
And they will stay with you forever

Among holy trees
Your guileful foe will never rest
These lands belong to you
Let your foe be damned forever

Look! Your friends betrayed you
Plundering your granary
And greedily dividing your lands
They paid their footing in foe's
Farvour by accepting strange faith
They will die in Swarog's fire!

Strong winds and thunder-storms are coming
Filling your enemies with terror
Because they have treason in hearts and disgrace
And falsehood is their religion

True faith of native land will resist
Bought at the price
Of shed blood of brave warriors
It will return at the full sheen of glory
And then we will return from distant lands
To stand by Perun's side

You were fighting bravely
Spilling seas of blood
Christians will remember your name
And your bloody pitiless deeds!
Be proud!
Gods appreciated your sacrifice!
