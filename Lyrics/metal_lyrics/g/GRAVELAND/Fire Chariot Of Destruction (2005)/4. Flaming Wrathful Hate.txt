We fight for the right
On what once was ours
Because we have the might
ItÂ´s in our blood of white
Our fight is not against'em
But in favor of us, only
And nothing can deceive us!
And nothing shall deceive us!

We fight for the right
We're proud of our white breed
We shield at any cost
Our honour, our blood, our folk
On behalf of it we shall battle
Maybe sheding our pure blood
But nothing can deceive us!
But nothing shall deceive us!

Hark!

Stingy sons of scum
We won't have any mercy
Your extinction is part of our fates
Your death is the will of our blades!
Day by day, as rises the sun
Ancient fire flames in us
Blazes of our growing pride
As our flaming wrathful hate!

These fires scorch our senses
We ignore all the prudence
Fear is banished from our minds
Our souls trample mercy and we fight!
Swords drown, revenge sworn
Because the blazes of our soul
May never cease to burn
As our flaming wrathful hate!
