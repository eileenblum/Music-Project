I ride!
With the winds I ride!
On my warhorse
I ride to the battlefield
Inspired by flames of hatred
Of my honor and of my pride!

In the distance
Far
I can see the smoke
Of my flaming homeland
Burnt by the foe
And I will not rest
Until I have revenged
All the dead ones of my blood

Day or night
Be clear or stormy
The sky - For my motherland
Europe erwache!
Nothing of none shall never
Scape from my wrath
From my sword!
