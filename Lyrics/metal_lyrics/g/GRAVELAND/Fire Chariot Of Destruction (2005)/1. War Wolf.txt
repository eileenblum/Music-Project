Stand up and fight
May the ancient magic give
You strength
Stand up and fight!
May the wolf inside you
Follow the voice of blood
Follow the northern star
To the lands where the spirits
Of your ancestors
Are waiting for you

Awake the beast within you!
Awake the hunter within you!
Wake up from a long sleep!

You have always been the one
Of the horde of hungry wolves
You followed the taste of blood
Through the thousands of years
In fetters of frosty winter
In heat of summer
In the streams of rain
In snowstorm

War was your nature
Fight was your love
Cruelty - Your passion
Killing - The enslavement of instinct

Your warcry - Cry of war wolf
Freeze the hearts of your foes
And victims
Enslaved by the instinct
You follow the voice of blood
The paths with no beginning
And no end
In pursuit for a victim that
Cannot escape

Nothing can change
Your nature
You are born for war
Warriors like you
Die fighting till the last breath
Wake up and reach
Your heritage!
You identity!
War wolf! Rise!

Stand up and fight!
May the ancient magic give
You strength
Stand up and fight!
Yours brothers wolfs return
This night!
