Wotan! Your chariots
Roll on the sky
The roars of the wild beasts
Roll over the lands
Under the sword of the loyal folk
The heads of your enemies
Turn lands to red

The creators of war triumph
The fire burns down the land
Tomorrow when the sun rises
The earth will revive in glory
Folk in anger and hatred today
Tomorrow in triumph and glory
The sons of blood shall
Follow your voice

Wotan! Bring destruction
May your fire chariots
With the holy fire
Permeate our lands
We will leave in the light
Of it's flames
To return in glory
When the sun rises again
The sons of war follow
Their master

Today your destroy
Tomorrow revive
Today bloody glow of fire
Tomorrow the sunshine
Our fate is bound
By the bounds of blood
We, your sons
Swear an oath of fidelity

Symbol of our faith
Revives from the ashes
The bounds of blood and fidelity
The time of oblivion
Will not fade away
In the red rays of sun
Fiery chariots
Make our dreams come true

Love and hatred
Peace and war
Birth and death
Creator and destroyer
Returns in glory!
