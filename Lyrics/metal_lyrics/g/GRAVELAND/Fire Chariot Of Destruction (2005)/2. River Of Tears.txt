On the river of tears
Bodies of killed warriors lie
Fallen Valkyries as broken flowers
The bravest warriors
Seized by the cold hands of death
Wind covers their bodies with ashes
Covers them in a blanket of red

The lady of a river with her maidens
Shall arrive in a deep sorrow
She shall kiss your forehead
For the last time
The sun is gone and the
Hills veiled in mist

The biting cold
Spreads to freeze hearts
In the red gleam of crying sun
Magic fog raises the bodies
Far away the horizon of oblivion

Wind sways the grass
Dew drops cover sword
Trees bow down
To honor leaving warriors
The sun disappears below
The horizon
World sinks in the color of blood
Silence lulls to sleep
And one can hear only
Quiet rustle of ghosts (Wraiths)
Whispering ancient spells

Out of the dark river
Cold hands raise
River maidens
Raise the bodies of death warriors
To the lands beyond the
Horizon of oblivion
Where sun disappears

When sun is gone
Lady of river with her maidens
Perform ancient rite
Ancient magic and power of earth
Will lead sons of sun
To the lands beyond the horizon
Where the shining paths
Of setting sun
Lead to the land of oblivion
