[bonus track: Polish version of "Into Death's Arms"]

......
Death is part of life
And life is part of death

Here on ancient tumulus
Of our ancestors
May our awareness, will and spirit
Join the past and the future
Of our blood and folk
To reach roots of our strength
And restore ancient glory...

Here among tumulus and stone circles
Our fate is bound
Our heritage and spiritual identity
Hidden deep in the earth
Reach hidden heritage
And restore ancient
Power and glory...
