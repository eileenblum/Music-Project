With rage born of years
Of christian slavery
I destroy symbols
Of christian domination
Falsehood and emptiness I desecrate
Fight makes me a beast
Subhuman are afraid of my name
I am their nightmare

My blood is Gods' blood
Father of my ancestors
Is my father
I erect my temple
On bloody battlefield
On wings of my
Revenge and hatred
Stained in blood of
Enemies of my freedom
My honor is the victory
I inflict deadly blows
To falsehood and traitors
On plain of death and cruelty

Among barrows of beasts of war
I will erect my gloomy temple
Temple of war and chaos
Proof of my bloody deeds
Proof of my strength and will
Statue and symbol of my cruelty
Where its shadow will spread
There will be no love anymore

On altar of war and hatred
I will give my death
With glory and honor
I will enter my father's lands

I am the one who
Wakes hidden dreams up
I am the one who
Summons demons of war
I make you warriors, so fight!!!
May your blood join mine
In temple of war
We will join our strength
