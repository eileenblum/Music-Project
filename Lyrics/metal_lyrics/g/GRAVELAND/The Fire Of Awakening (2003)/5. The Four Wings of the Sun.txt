In the shield of the Sun is the power
The light of the Aryan knowledge
The four wings of the sun
The hope of spirits, and the strength of will
As proud ancient Gods stand by his side
Wotan raises his shield to protect me from the shine
Women and children
Old warriors
Stone statues
Cold eyes and bright eyes
The four wings of the sun
Feed my pride and will
Their shade that falls on the Earth
Paves the way of my dreams
The paths that I walk upon 
Lead me through the darkness
There where my fate is; the warriors old faith
The earth hides the truth of past centuries within herself
I feel her breath and strength
Within her the spirits lay, which call upon us to fulfill our duty
The battle for souls will soon come to be
Runes will speak in ancient tongue
The Runes which wrote my path of life
The Gods look upon me, form their Golden thrones
Above their heads a bright symbol shines
The four wings of the Sun
The ancient Aryan sign 
Wotan rises his shield
To protect me from the shine
