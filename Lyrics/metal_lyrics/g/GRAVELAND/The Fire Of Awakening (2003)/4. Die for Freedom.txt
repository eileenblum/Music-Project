For freedom - Death
For freedom - Blood
For freedom - Fire
For freedom - Destruction 
Warrior awake 
And step upon the path of honor
Bid farewell to your family and land
Because the time for war has come
The anthem of war horns, and battle drumming
Are heard all throughout the lands
The rhythm of war, wrath and destruction
When the enemy crosses your border
Red glows of fire will greet his coming
No one will defend your land, without you bravery and hand
No one will defend your freedom, without your sacrifice
Today is the day that you make a self-sacrifice
For bloodied Gods sacrifice your life
For freedom - Death
For freedom - Blood
For freedom - Fire
For freedom - Destruction 
Even though, today you will be
Fighting against hordes alone
Even though cowards and traitors are outnumbering you
The Gods will always be with you, on your way of war and honor
You yourself against everybody else, will wage a victorious war 
Just like your ancestors you will fight today 
And nobody will take away your honor and glory
Your wrath and will is all that counts now
Your spirits fortitude embedded in blood 
On the battlefield under the sign of Wotan 
One against enemy's hordes
You'll stand proud, ready to fight, never backing out
