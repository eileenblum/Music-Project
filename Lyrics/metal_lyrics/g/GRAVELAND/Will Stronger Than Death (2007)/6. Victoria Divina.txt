I hear singing the children
And shines bright the sun this day
Green of life of grass embraces the earth
Skies of deep blue embraces de grass
Viktoria divina
Viktoria divina we all celebrate

Because our light now
Is free from darkness
And our days shall be endless
Until the end of all times
Because our light now
Is free from darkness
And from all menace t our soil
Since we carry our soil
Dissolve in our blood

Glorious is the lineage of our people
In past and now an so it will be
After many won battles
And many won wars
Remained ashes of foe
Viktoria divina
Viktoria divina we all celebrate

Now it's time to enjoy our time
Because our light now
Is free from darkness
And nothing can deceive
Nor surmont us
Until the end of all times
Because our light now
Is free from darkness
And eternity we've conquered

Sing, O' golden-hair children!
Bloom your home-green, livid grasses!
All joyous voices, sound! Sing!
Viktoria divina
Viktoria divina we all celebrate
On behalf of allfather Odin! Spring!
