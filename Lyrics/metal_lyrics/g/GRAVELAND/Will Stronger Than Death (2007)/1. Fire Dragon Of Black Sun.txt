From the red tongues of fire
The wings grow at horizon
The wind lashes them harshly
Fire is deeper than night

The cry from the depths of the abyss
Tears the silence arcane
The rays of night bend the knees
And there he is, son of the sun,
From his flesh and blood

The red tongues of fire
Reach the depths of the universe
The talons of the fire beast
Stuck in the snake flesh

Fire dragon feeds with the darkness
His eyes pierce the time
His blood is an eternal fire
Matter burning among the stars

On the wings of the eternity
The sun will raise the shield of power
Cold breeze from the land of shadow
Will not freeze the warriors' hearts anymore

Fire faster than the wind
Blood hotter than burning magma
A hiss of a dying snake
The melody of a lamenting darkness
The element beyond the time
The unbridled will flickers
Talons holding out into the space
Searching for the invisible enemy

Rewared with eternal sleep
With dead cold faces
Wake up! Rise
From your stone graves!
