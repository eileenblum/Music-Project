Cruel storm is lashing my ship
I hear my people's cries
Wind sweeps their words away and carry off into the abyss
Icy rain pierces through our bodies
Depth open its skies
We will plunge in the dark abyss
Or we will walk towards our destiny
Written with ancient runes
My comrades fight for life
They are strong, brave and relentless
But their cries mean nothing
Today our destiny is in God's hands
We won many battles
We overcame many brave warriors
We were pleased with gained treasures
And laments of the defeated
But our bravery and ruthlessness
Mean nothing to the sea monsters
Today we will be the victims
If we survive this storm
Wotan! We will sing you a song of glory
Witches put spell on our ship
The course reached us
The course of the committed crimes and desecrated temples
Our greed is punished
Soon our bones fall on the bottom of the sea
Inevitable end is coming
Sea eager for our blood
We will make a sacrifice of bravest warriors
Wind will sing funeral song
Wotan! Take your sons!
