I am a warrior!
I grasp the greatness of my people
And trustful I fight strenuously
For a day I may have right upon
The splendorous heritage of my ancestors
By securing the purity of my blood
My folk's perpetuity, my culture's nobility
My land's integrity, my ancestors memory
I claim for Thee! Ancient braves warrior spirits!
Forefathers and brothers of mine!
Strengthen me - my body and soul
Lead me to victory in combat, glory on battle
For Thee I shall fight!
And I'll battle in the fluids of hatred
For Thee I shall slay!
And fervently I'll raise to the clouds
The my Sol Invictus' banner and bloody sword
With brothers and sister celebrate
Offer Thee the spoils of war
And the enemies' final twilight
Nevertheless if a day the war takes place
Consuming the last breaths of my being
Spilling my blood over the battlefield's ground
And my sword breaks in two parts
My spirit weakens... my anima vanishes...
I shall not flee from warfront
For my duty perfect fulfillment
Even if I carry broken bones on me
It doesn't matter, 'till death, without fear
I'll battle and fight and struggle and strive
Without mercy or smallest remorse
For a whole Era of glories
Triumphs and victories of Thy sons
And forthcoming eons of supremacy
On behalf of dead braves of my blood
Make not vain the loss of my life!
Concede me sit together with Thee
Among those of mine on paradise
Send the Valkyries here take me
Crown heroic my departure!
Listen to me, my ancestors!
Wait for me! I shall arrive!
