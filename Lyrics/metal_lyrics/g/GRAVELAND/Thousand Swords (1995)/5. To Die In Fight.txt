Cruel coldness turns my heart to ice
heavy snowy clouds,
covered the nightly sky
Snow is falling, wind is blowing
and its cold.
Blood in my veins got stopped,
woulded i await my last hour
hen the snow covers my body
when the icy ship takes me
to the land of the gods.
A dream makes union with reality
cold snow hurts my eyes
The forest is far from here
and my horse is dead
I lost my last battle
victory was so near....
in the snowy bed
I found my peace
Now I'm waiting for drackar
Gods promised me
it will come soon
Blood in my veins got stopped,

and my horse is dead

I found my peace
Now I'm waiting for drackar

Darken's speech in the liner notes..

"I am Darken, black druid of darkness and warrior of the new aeon... I
surround myself by blackness, because I wage war in the name of my land...in
the name of my gods...war with christianity, war with false good and mercy
which came from the foreign land and conquered our country.  They were all
talking about love, pardon, they were lying!  They called our gods devils!
they burnt the woods...they burnt our temples.  They brought manslaughter and
plague in the name of what?  In the name of god, who was a man!

All my brothers and sisters, sages and kings died defending their fatherland
and its true gods.  Christianity burnt our temples and replaced them with
their miserable cowsheds! possessed christians baptized our lands, forests,
rivers and people!

They banished the spirits of our fatherland, who lived here from the
beginning!!! They opened our land for foreigners who mixed blood!

My hate and belief gives me the power...gods stand on my side, because I
believe in the spirits of my ancestors,...blackness is the only colour of my
garments, because I made the alliance with darkness for this war.  I hate, and
hate gives me the power... Once upon a time, I was dreaming about thousand
swords....fire reached the sky, and black smoke covered the sun...I wanted to
rink some water from the river, but there was only blood in the river! The
earth trembled, far from me kettle drums and war horns resounded...

One sword to behead the white ruler sitting on the white throne in the vatican.
One sword for the ruler who will come and unite us under the sign of the cross
with broken arms. Eleven swords to behead eleven lords and rulers of the land
united under the blue banner. One sword to revenge my brothers, who died from
the hands of the christian hangmen. Hundred swords to defend our southern
boundaries against black plague and half moon. One sword for me to let me
bravely defend my stronghold, and may I call this sword, "desaster of
christians" soon.
