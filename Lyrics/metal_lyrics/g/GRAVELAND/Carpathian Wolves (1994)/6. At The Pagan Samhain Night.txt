Dark was the sky and cold was this night
I saw in dusk the shifting stars
Inside the circle of mysterious sings
A little casket drowned in blood
The horned one gave me the key
I opened the casket to see my fate
The ultimate fate of mine
Pagan warrior, son of the dark sky...
Fire of eternal hell inflamed the left path
The priest of Darkness, Druid named Schakh
He opened my third eye, his evil soul became mine
We were bonded by blood, our hearts beat the same
"Thou belong to me now, follow me in dawn
We are the same, the soul of man
Look in my eyes, see burning stars
Crucify the lier, create Dark Empire"
Through the veil of fog I heard his voice
I was cold, but sweet as an immortal dream
I know the one taught to survive by the 
carpathian code of life...
He hold the silver sword and Black book
The symbols of mystic strength and wisdom
I understood these signs of Darkness
My knowledge became my secret weapon...
At the pagan Samhain night
I entered the Darkside
Evil arrived far from the North
I know the might of Demonolord
