When the Black clouds cover the moon
And reality turns into nightmare
Lighting cuts through the dark sky
Almighty Perun gave us his sign !
Brothers, wolves, I summon you !
Wind will bring you my howling
And smell of the human blood
Yes, I found another sacrifice
Droops of blood upon the stone
I lick the cold virgins corpse
I an blinded by my bloodlust
I the Northern Carpathians
Mystic eyes between the trees
Brothers hungry for the blood
Through the blood I find desire
The only sense of the evil life
Immortality is true
For the creatures without shadows
There is hell on the earth
In the Northern Carpathians...
Unholy woods of mysteries
Alone witches full of hate
Werewolves hidden in the caves
Forgotten spells of pagan past
Long nights and hours of darkness
Cold mountain winds blow through the trees
Diabolic feast around the fire
Dark shadows dancing with flames
There is a place where Evil lives
There are woods where people die
At midnight blood is more precious than gold
In the Northern Carpathians...
