I came, led by the stars
Spirits of the damned draw me near
Mayhemed winds showed me the way
And now i stay here, born from the wolf

Scream of pain sounds in Darkness
I draw my claws in wall of fog
I scrape, scream, blood covered my scars
my fangs tear the gates to Abyss

Impure spirits, you showed me the way
And now my blood becomes the key
I open this last gate
The Gate to the Kingdom of Darkness

Black wind of the dead
Inflamed my eyes to red
My brothers, wolves, servants of the night
They came from the forest

Burning eyes among the Darkness
Jaws thirsty for the blood, raised to moon
Hired, longing and fear
This is the last night and the dawn will never come
Curse me, my brothers
Because I lead you to death
Salvation for mayhemed souls
Souls of sons of the night in wolves bodies

We've been always and we'll be forever
Tonight we'll die and the next night
we will come from beyond the gates
of Kingdom of Darkness

Gods of Darkness, awoken by our sacrifice
Beast of gloom, spirits of fear
Triumph of unlife's Powers
Banners of the dead smeared in blood!

Black is the ultimate colour
Darkness is the only end
Evil is the right reaction
Death is the only mercy...
