Down in the silence of your heart
Find a piece of me alive again
Nowhere hide
Open your gates wide

From the Land of Discipline
I will find a way
Out, a man made of Pride
Don't feel so down

Down on the Freedom
Down on the Freedom in my eyes
Down on the Freedom
Down on the Freedom in my heart

Down on the Freedom
Down on the Freedom in my eyes
Down on the Freedom
Down on the Freedom in my heart
