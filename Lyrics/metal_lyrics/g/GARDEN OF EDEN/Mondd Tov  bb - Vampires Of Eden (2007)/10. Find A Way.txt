[Bonus Track]You believe in me
Noble savage on our side
We'll find a way
No one ever has to die
Reveal the light
You'll never have to find the time
To seek the right
chance till the sun still shines

Those people's eye
When they lay
The plan of may
Close the night
Find a way
People lie
No more wonder
Same old people die

I will never feed
A relationship of lies
We'll find a way
So that no more precious time
Will fade away
Wanne live or die
Never thought but you may
(One more time)
