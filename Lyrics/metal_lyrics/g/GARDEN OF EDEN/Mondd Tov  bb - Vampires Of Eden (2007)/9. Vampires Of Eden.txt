So great you know me from the night
I give advice this time
Don't care about holy trinity
What matters are you and me
So enjoy immortality
I show you infinity
I'll be the sun upon your sky

Vampires of Eden cross your way
Your soul is all you pay
To join the ideology
What matters are you and me
Let's seek together the holy cross of light
So we needn't hide, we needn't hide

Don't hide your face
Nowhere to hide
The sun is on your side
You needn't hide

We beat the light
Nowhere to hide
Infinity's mine
You needn't hide
