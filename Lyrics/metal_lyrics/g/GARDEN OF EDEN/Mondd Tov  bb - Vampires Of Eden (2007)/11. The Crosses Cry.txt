[Bonus Track]The crosses cry
Even the devils cry
Eternal fever need
Please carry me

Open up the night
revive the Gothic Times
Vampire burned in me
Awake and see

No don't wanne see through
Don't tell me one more lie
Entirely lost in a fiction
Your smile makes me fine

No don't wanna see through evils eye
I'll never let xou down
Lost in a fiction
Always by your side
