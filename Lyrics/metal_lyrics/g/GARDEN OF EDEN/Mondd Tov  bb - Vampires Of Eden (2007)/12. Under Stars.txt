[Bonus Track]Rain, seaside foggy weather thears the bay
We're on the dark side of our time
If you send me now away
I feel I'll go my way
Under stars I'll be even more alive

Your foe like scent
Makes me wanna fight
Just be silent
Put your arms around
Against all Odds
All I want to do
Is making love to you
All through the night

Light, the sun breaks now that gorgeous night
We're on the dark side of our time
If you send me now away
I feel I'll go my way
Under stars I'll be even more alive
