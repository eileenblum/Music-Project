Don't feel the pain, Oh
Don't need the light
You.
But maybe life's a mission
Life is common paid reflection

Don't feel the same, Oh
And never to live
So.
But maybe life's a mission
Life is common paid reflection

Won't be the same
Never that way
I'll be away
Ever you see me on my way
You may always join my mission

My time was never here before
I can see it now
My time was never never before
