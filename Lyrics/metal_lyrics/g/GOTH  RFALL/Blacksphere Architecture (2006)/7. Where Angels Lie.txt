From the winds are rising the ashes of earth, by men, raped and burned
Which is surrounded by dark clouds and sordid emptiness

Icons of creation are standing as stones, waiting for the end
Towards your eyes angels are filing oceans with blood

Blood rivers flowing down the flesh, a human overgasm
As god's holy wine is poured in prestigious gold
The source of lust of the weakest weak

Evil immortal is dressing in sumptuous red through carnal fluids
For the great marriage of life and death

Its path shall lead us to the core existence
With poison or ignorance as beverage
Puisse la connaissance salvatrice nous accueillir Ã  bras grands ouverts
Leading us in the deepest pits, where angels lie

Where angel lie...
A paradise of flames and desolation

A shrine in total putrefaction - a whoke world falling into oblivion
A so-called heaven which man painted in shades of grey
A neglected astra skinned by a torrent of smoke and tears
An organic location where everything shall return to silence

The sky escapes under a funeral mist
And the stars are eclipsing with sin
Symptoms of the endless mourning, of every human massacres
And the hindrance of every remorse of men

In your veins
Evil immortal is dressing in sumptuous red through carnal fluids
For the great marriage of life and death

Icons of creation are standing as stones, waiting for the end
Towards your eyes angels are filing oceans with blood

From the winds are rising the ashes of earth, by men, raped and burned
Which is surrounded by dark clouds and sordid emptiness

Its path shall lead us to the core existence
With poison or ignorance as beverage
Crushing every hope to save what remains of our mother ship, through time
Leading us in the deepest pits, where angels lie
