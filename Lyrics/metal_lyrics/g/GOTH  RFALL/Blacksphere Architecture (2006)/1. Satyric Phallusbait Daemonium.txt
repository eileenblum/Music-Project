Midst earth and half hearted... dying

Once an empire of green chaos
With a merging essence unfolded
Turned to a land of desolation
The creation of deconstruction...

"Dark Archangel; Unholy
Thou adornst the cault
Where matrix bled since genesis
Such a cervix in agony
With cerulean eyes I taste your acrid
Carnal fluids eternally"

A profaned vulva by the will of a Jehovah
Since the first lights, days subtly darken
Into nothingness we progress
To procreate successively

"To please thy hunger for flesh
An unsexed beast raped, blind of greed
Thou surrenderedest to baleful stretches
With a phallusbait thou hast been fed
On narrow valleys dew sprang
Over tides while you sang
A moonlike drew what had been spurred
A vingin whore attireless"

O hearing the cold cries of the virgin's child
An anthem for those who preached morality
With self-narrated faerytales obsession overgrown
On accursed journey to higher worlds, unknown

Silver clouds, below fragile tenderness
Covering the whore
And Satyric Phallusbait daemonium

"Toward thy splendor I nod
Dressed with a sky sublime
Unlicked aura polished with passion
Bent to unhallowed sights horizons
Frozen romance under snowflakes
ChÃ©rissant ton visage blafard"

...euphemist passion revealed with a nectar of mine
A nimbostratus carnival upon a sealed love
Wished by a Faunus Lupercus
For once, wulfgarity applauded

Once an empire of green chaos
With a merging essence unfolded
Turned to a land of desolation
The creation of deconstruction...

"Dark Archangel; Unholy
Thou adornst the cault
Where matrix bled since genesis
Such a cervix in agony
With cerulean eyes I taste your acrid
Carnal fluids eternally"
Until my dust becomes darker
The progenies of man - the greatest plague

A profaned vulva by the will of Jehovah

To become the great ruler of fallen souls

"Toward thy splendor I nod
Dressed with a sky sublime
Unlicked aura polished with passion
Bent to the sights of unhallowed horizons"

"You land of mine, persecuted by man, shall punish us all by an Iron hand - Armageddon..."
