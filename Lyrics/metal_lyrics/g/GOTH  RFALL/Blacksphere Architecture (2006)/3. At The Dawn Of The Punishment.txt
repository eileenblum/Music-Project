In order to escape from abhorrence of life
Some promise their allegiance to God
They sink deep into stupidity
So feeble and blind they are...
Across the dark landscape
Misleading by its appearance
Amon the weak ones

Over humans a great plague shall be spread
By vaginal transmission; fotus-shaped
A disease, limitless, in every society
No matter its doctrine or blood

At the dawn of the punishment
Thou shalt regret thine execrable life
Thou shalt kneel down facing the eclipse
And wish that your life never been so far

Eradication: Haunting my thoughts
Every single day God gives us
Hence I must poison men's existence

Session of massacre upon the channels
Duality in conflict unable to merge
A man-made clinic scheme:
Calamitronic dissolution to chronic sin...

With empty ocular apertures
We look from below
With hope of seeing him
The creator of nothing and everything

Holding in his hand
The almighty virus
To counter the demons
And those masked men behind them

In the night we wander
By the moonlight digging our way
Through sewers between excrements and vermin
Trying to save what remains of sanity

At the dawn of the punishment
Thou shalt regret thine execrable life
Thou shalt kneel down facing the eclipse
And wish that your life never been so far

Eradication: Haunting my thoughts
Every single day God gives us
Hence I must poison men's existence

Session of massacre upon the channels
Duality in conflict unable to merge
A man-made clinic scheme:
Calamitronic dissolution to chronic sin...

With empty ocular apertures
We look from below
With hope of seeing him
The architect of the black sphere

Holding in his hands
The almighty sword
To counter the demons
And those masked men behind them

"By night suffocate, you can't breather here anymore
By man - the stopped run of the haemogoblin
The only true doctrine remaining now
Is the one formerly known as Asphyxia
To escape our world..."

A night feast under the darkened sun
A sacred ritual under the lightened moon
Traveling from locations to others
In a cosmic trip, caressing blades

"Holy steel
Leading mortals to their fatality
In a so beatiful destiny we drown"

At the dawn of the punishment
Thou shalt regret thine execrable life
Thou shalt kneel down facing the eclipse
And wish that your life never been so far

Spiral warfare in a forest of bones
Crushing the wuphoric civilization
With an upheaval of thorns tightening its heart
Oniriction crashing at once
The end of an age believed to last eternally
The failure of the beast, the fall of man
Soothed by bloodrains and lullaby
With the tortuous wind appearing as a prophet
It's time for the dead nature to appear, desolated

A night feast under the darkened sun...
A sacred ritual under the lightened moon

Eradication: Haunting my thoughts
Every single day God gives us
Awaiting at the gate of our time
Its breath ignites our soil to dust

Ã l'aube du chÃ¢timent
In so beatiful destiny we dress...
