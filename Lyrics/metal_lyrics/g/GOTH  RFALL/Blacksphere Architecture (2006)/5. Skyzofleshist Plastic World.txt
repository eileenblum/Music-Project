In the sky falls the flesh of our world
With wide incisions, we unleash the chaos
Collapsing the realm of souls

Ironseas and boneclouds at lost of sight
The toxic air makes you vanish into night
The dead land we crawl; harvesters of blood
Searching life in the ashes of our earth
Bionic whores and mechanic war
Leading what has been called "world"
Sailing on corpseas; beneath the stars
Which distance is not as far as it has been
Under the darkened sun, life is no more...
Fathers fall, fallen gods, failing from the tattered sky

While insanity rises up to the firmament
And the stellar light turns to slavery
Winter waves dive into decadence
And the irrational comes as a burden

Contemplate the last of aeons!
Funeral transmission interrupted by newborn cells
Corrupted by human aberrations
Sleeping in debris of past creation
Then survival doesn't remain as an option
No divine intervention will occur to relieve your fears
With angels we fall, wings wide opened
Doomed by burning avidity

And thus the kingdom of men must be covered by
Broken feathers and ashes rains...

Ironseas and boneclouds at lost of sight
The toxic air makes you vanish into light
The dead land we crawl; harvesters of flesh
Searching life in the ashes of our earth
Bionic war and mechanic whores
Leading what has been called "world"
Sailing on corpse seas; beneath the stars
Which distance is not as close as it has been
Within the black sphere, life is no more...
And from the tattered sky fall the broken wings of man

And thus the kingdom of God must be covered by
Broken feathers and ashes rains...
