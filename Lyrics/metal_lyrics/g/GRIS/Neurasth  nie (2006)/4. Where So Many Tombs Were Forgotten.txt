The night, so dark, so beautiful, as your eyes
Endless lethargic frames of mind
Winds of sorrow divide my soul in pain
The past is a current liveâ¦

Thousands of broken pieces of sharpened glass
Reflect my cold emotions in the empathic ways
Of my desperation

Wandering in the coldest depression
In front of so many nameless graves
In this pessimistic burial ground
Where so many tombs were forgottenâ¦

I dwell in the sewers of lifeâ¦

Thousands of broken pieces of sharpened glass
Reflect my cold emotions in the empathic ways
of my desperation

The night, so dark, so beautiful, as your eyes
Endless lethargic frames of mind
Winds of sorrow blow my sick reflections
To Where so many tombs were forgottenâ¦
