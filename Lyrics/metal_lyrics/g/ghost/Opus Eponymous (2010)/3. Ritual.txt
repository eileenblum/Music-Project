Tonight weÂ´re summoned for a divine cause
Remembrance - No
But for their future loss

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar...

Beduins and nomads
Carried through the times
Through pestilences and famines
These ancient scrolls of rhymes

"Our fallen angel vexed
Was banished from the sky
Recite now from the text
Pray for ALL to die"

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar bed
On this night of ritual
Invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard

"Our father
Who art in hell
Unhallowed be thy name
Cursed be the sons and daughters
Of thine Nemesis
Whom are to blame
Thy kingdom come
nemA"

Tonight we summoned for His unholy fiend
Now celebrate
The End

This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices
From the altar bed
On this night of ritual
Invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard
