Devil's Power Is The Greatest One
When His' And Hers' Holiest Shuns The Sun
A Temptress Smitten By The Blackest Force
A Vicar Bitten Blind In Intercourse

The Witch Hammer
Struck Her Down
Through Our Sabbath
She Is Unbound

It Is The Night Of The Witch
It Is The Night Of The Witch Tonight
And The Vengeance Is Hers For As Long As She Stands By Him
It Is The Night Of The Witch
It Is The Night Of The Witch Tonight
And The Vengeance Is Hers For As Long As She Stands By Him

"All Witchcraft Comes
From Carnal Lust
Which Is In Women Insatiable"

A Moon Shone Bright Above Her Trial
As Flames Ate Through Her Body Defiled

The Witch Hammer
Struck Her Down
Through Our Sabbath
She Is Unbound

It Is The Night Of The Witch
It Is The Night Of The Witch Tonight
And The Vengeance Is Hers For As Long As She Stands
