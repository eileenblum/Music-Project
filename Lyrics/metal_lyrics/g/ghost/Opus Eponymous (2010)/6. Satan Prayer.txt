Believe in one god do we
Satan almighty
The uncreator of heaven and soil
And the unvisable and the visable

And in his son
Begotten of father
By whom all things will be unmade

Who for man and his damnation
Incarnated
Rise up from hell
From sitteth on the left hand of his father
From thense he shall come to judge

Out of one substance
With Satan
Whose kingdom shall haveth no end

Hear our Satan prayer
Our anti nicene creed
Hear our Satan prayer
For the cuming of seed
Hear our Satan prayer
Our anti nicene creed
Hear our Satan prayer
For the cuming of seed

Unholy ghost
Overlord and taker of life

Hear our Satan prayer
Our anti nicene creed
Hear our Satan prayer
For the cuming of seed
Hear our Satan prayer
Our anti nicene creed
Hear our Satan prayer
For the cuming of seed
