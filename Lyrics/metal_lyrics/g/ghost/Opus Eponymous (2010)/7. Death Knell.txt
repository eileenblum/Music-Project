Say, can you see the cross?
Inverted solemnly
Symbol for the goat
Of a thousand young

Six six six
Evoke the king of hell
Strike the death knell
Death knell

Say, can you hear the chimes?
Tolls now for the end
Bells call out their doom
As victor reaches womb

Sex sex sex
Receive the beast of evil
Of evil...

Can you say his name?
Carrier of the light
Legions of this seed
A child you as a spouse will feed

S-A-T-A-N
Under spell
Of death knell
Death knell
