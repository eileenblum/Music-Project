[Bonus Track]We conquered the magic
We counted the stars
Deciphered the clockwork
Enacted this farce

Devoured by shadows
We cling to the light
Deluded by wisdom
The bringer of night

Now and for always
A perpetual rise
A fall of illusion
Your Zenith fades into eternity

Time will soon be gone
Night will turn to dawn
Winds come on strong
So help you god
Come unleashed
You're set free

A genesis captured
Ignited by truth
A martyr disraptured
A vision too soon

Devoured by shadows
We cling to the light
Deluded by wisdom
The bringer of night

Now and for always
A perpetual rise
A fall of illusion
Your Zenith fades into eternity

Time will soon be gone
Night will turn to dawn
Winds come on strong
So help you god
Come unleashed
You're set free

Saecula Saeculorum [8x]

Time will soon be gone
Night will turn to dawn
Winds come on strong
So help you god
Come unleashed
You're set free
