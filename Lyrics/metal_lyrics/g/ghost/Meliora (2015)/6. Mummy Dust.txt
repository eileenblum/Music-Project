I was carried on a wolfâs back
Here to corrupt humanity
I will pummel it with opulence
With corpulence and greed
In god you trust

My mummy dust
My mummy dust

Your cavalier of crapulence
To this feast of rapacity
I will bury you in treasures
Just to feed your incapacity
In god you trust

My mummy dust
My mummy dust

You are the possessÃ©e of avarice
I am the ruler of the earth
I will smother you in riches
Until you choke on sordid mirth

You are summoned in cupidity
Purulence and lust
I am the magnet for stupidity
Divine you feel my thrust
In god you trust

My mummy dust
My mummy dust

[The Collective sings]
In god you trust
