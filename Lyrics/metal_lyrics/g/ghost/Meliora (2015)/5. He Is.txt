We're standing here by the abyss
And the world
Is in flames

Two star-crossed lovers reaching out
To the beast
With many names

[Chorus]
He is
Heâs the shining in the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite
Heâs the force that made me be
He is
Nostro Dispater
Nostr'Alma Mater
He is

Weâre hiding here inside a dream
And all our doubts
Are now destroyed

The guidance of the morning star
Will lead the way
Into the void

[Chorus]
He is
Heâs the shining in the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite
Heâs the force that made me be
He is
Nostro Dispater
Nostr'Alma Mater
He is

[Chorus]
He is
Heâs the shining in the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite
Heâs the force that made me be
He is
Heâs the shining in the light
Without whom I cannot see
And he is
The disobedience that holds us together
He is
Nostro Dispater
Nostr'Alma Mater
And we are falling
Over the precipice
