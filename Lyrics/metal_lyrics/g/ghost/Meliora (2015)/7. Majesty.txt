A higher power underground
From seraph skies and now to chaos bound
He is sitting sacred and profound
In midst of sinners licking up to kiss his crown

Pathetic humans in despair
Defaced, deflowered, now to death devout
A fallen angel in his glare
In midst of sinners kneeling down before His clout

[Chorus:]
Old One, Master
All beauty lies within
Old One, Master
All beauty lies within you

This oasis is a poisoned well
Of rotting carcasses that clog the deep
A prince in exile here in Hell
In midst of sinners flocking up like soulless sheep

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

Your Infernal Majesty
