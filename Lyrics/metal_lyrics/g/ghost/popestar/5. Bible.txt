[originally by Imperiet]The earth was spinning all vacant and waste
And there was silence over the ocean
When a voice came thundering from above
The first day of light was in motion

And the voice said may fruits be created
And seeds take root as they may
And no crimes were yet committed
An life was breathing it's second day

And in his image the voice made a man
And a woman to love one another
And they became rulers of the new born globe
And the third day was their mother

Now who will prey for Babylon
Sing a song to Babylon
On their knees the people of Babylon
You beat that drum 'cause Babylon is falling

Man and woman learn to make fire
And kingdoms and walls were extended
The fourth day the walls were reaching so far
No-one knew how to end them

And no one heard the voice anymore
Metal-cities rose and ascend
The fifth day sprinted in to fall
And a rain fell over the land

There are no walls to stop such a rain
That keeps falling forever more
I was told by a voice the sixth day
The earth was like an open soar

Now who will prey for Babylon
Sing a song to Babylon
On their knees the people of Babylon
You beat that drum 'cause Babylon is falling

The earth was spinning all vacant and waste
And there was silence over the oceans
When a voice came thundering from above
The seventh day was in motion

Now who will prey for Babylon
Sing a song to Babylon
On their knees the people of Babylon
You beat that drum 'cause Babylon is falling
