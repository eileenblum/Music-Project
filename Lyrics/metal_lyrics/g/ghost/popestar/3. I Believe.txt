[originally by Simian Mobile Disco]I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe

It's the same old song
That I always sing each year
But because it's perennial
Don't make it less real

And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe

I believe you could be
(I believe)
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(Oh, it just keeps coming 'round again)

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)

The conclusion I need
Is easily reached with you
You have given me all
And there's nothing left to do

And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe
I believe
It just keeps coming 'round again

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)

I believe you could be
What I need to believe
(It just keeps coming 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
