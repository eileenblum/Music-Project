Many a sin I have witnessed,
and in many indeed I have been
Many a rat I've befriended,
and so many a thorn stood between.

But of all the demons I've known
none could compare to you.

Every day that you
feed me with hate
I grow stronger!

Every day that you
feed me with hate
I grow stronger!

Drink me, eat me,
then youâll see the light.
Drink me, eat me,
then youâll see the light.

Many a mind I have haunted,
and in many a way I have been.
Often the one to have flaunted,
an image grotesque and obscene.

But of all these
dark roads that I roam,
none could compare to you.

Every day that you
feed me with hate
I grow stronger!

Every day that you
feed me with hate
I grow stronger!

Drink me, eat me,
then youâll see the light.
Drink me, eat me,
then youâll see the light.

Every day that you
feed me with hate
I grow stronger!

Every day that you
feed me with hate
I grow stronger!
