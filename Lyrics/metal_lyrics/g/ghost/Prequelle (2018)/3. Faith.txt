There is a scourge
in the guise of sanctity,
a perpetrator with a quill.

Although itâs often
steeped in well spun mystery,
the accuser sends the bill.

I am all eyes,
I am all ears,
I am the wall,
and Iâm watching you fall!.

Because faith is mine!

The Luddites
shun the diabolical,
a fecal trail across the land.

Although it stinks,
feels, and looks identical,
a pack of fools can take the stand.

I am all eyes,
I am all ears,
I am the wall,
and Iâm watching you fall!.

Because faith is mine!
