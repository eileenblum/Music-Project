Can you hear me
say your name, forever?
Can you see me longing
for you, forever?

Would you let me touch
your soul, forever?
Can you feel me longing
for you, forever, forever?

I know the light
grows darker down below.
But in your eyes
it's gone before you know.

This is the moment
of just letting go.
She said,
"if you had life eternal".

Can you hear me
say your name, forever?
Can you see me longing
for you, forever?

Would you let me touch
your soul, forever?
Can you feel me longing
for you, forever, forever?

We dance once more,
I feel your hands are cold.
Within your heart,
a story to be told.

This is the moment
of just letting go,
this is the moment
of just letting go...

Can you hear me
say your name, forever?
Can you see me longing
for you, forever?

Would you let me touch
your soul, forever?
Can you feel me longing
for you, forever and ever?

Forever...
