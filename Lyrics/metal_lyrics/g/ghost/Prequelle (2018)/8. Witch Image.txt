You Have never stood this
close to where you want to be.
You have always waded in the shallows
between me and the deep blue sea.

You'd never want me to appear,
you never want this to be over.
You never want it to reach out
to the edge of time.

While you sleep in earthly delight
someone's flesh is rotting tonight.
Like no other to you,
what you've done you cannot undo.

I have always kept you
closer than you've known.
I am riding in the shadows
behind you on a pale white horse.

You'd never want me to appear,
you never want this to be over.

Someone's flesh is rotting tonight.
Like no other to you,
what you've done you cannot undo.

While you sleep in earthly delight,
still your soul will suffer this plight.
Like your father in Hell,
what you've sold you cannot unsell.

While you sleep in earthly delight
someone's flesh is rotting tonight.
Like no other to you,
what you've done you cannot undo.

While you sleep in earthly delight,
still your soul will suffer this plight.
But like a mother would save
her own child from digging a grave.
