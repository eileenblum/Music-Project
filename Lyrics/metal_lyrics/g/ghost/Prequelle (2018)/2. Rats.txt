In times of turmoil,
in times like these.
Belief is contagious,
spreading disease.

This wretched mischief is now
coursing through your souls.
Never to let go,
never to let go.

Rats!

Into your sanctum
you let them in.
Now all your loved ones
and all your kin.

Will suffer punishments
beneath the wrath of God.
Never to forgive,
never to forget.

Rats...

This devastation left
your cities to be burnt.
Never to return,
never to return.

And filthy rodents are
still coming for your souls.
Never to let go,
never to let go.

Rats...

They're still coming after you,
and there's nothing you can do.
They're still coming after you,
and there's nothing you can do.

Rats...
