Lucifer whispering
silently into your mind.
Who walks behind,
who walks behind?

Standing tall, invincible,
but do not forget your knives
to save your lives,
to save your lives.

Don't you forget about dying!
Don't you forget about your friend, Death!
Don't you forget that you will die!

Donât you vomit savage slurs
spewed up wickedly
to hide from me,
to hide from me.

Navigate all alone
on this tempestuous sea
to ride with me,
to ride with me.

Don't you forget about dying!
Don't you forget about your friend, Death!
Don't you forget that you will die!

Don't you forget about dying!
Don't you forget about your friend, Death!
Don't you forget that you will die!

Lucifer whispering
silently into your mind.
Who walks behind,
who walks behind?

Had you had the chance today
you couldâve sold out too.
Ainât that right,
Swede Saint Peter?

Don't you forget about dying!
Don't you forget about your friend, Death!
Don't you forget that you will die!

Don't you forget about dying!
Don't you forget about your friend, Death!
Don't you forget that you will die!
