You'll soon be hearing
the chime close to midnight.
If I could turn back the time
I'd make all right.

How could it end like this?
There's a sting in the way you kiss me.
Something within your eyes
said it could be the last time.

Before it's over!

Just wanna be,
wanna bewitch you
in the moonlight

Just wanna be,
I wanna bewitch you
all night.

It keeps on giving
me chills, but I know now.
I feel the closer we
get to the last bow.

I donât wanna end like this,
but there's sting in
the way you kiss me.
I'm loving it!

Something within your eyes
said it could be the last time,
before it's over!

Just wanna be,
wanna bewitch you
in the moonlight

Just wanna be,
I wanna bewitch you
all night.

Just wanna be,
I wanna bewitch you
one last time in
the ancient rite.

Just wanna be,
I wanna bewitch you
all night.

Just wanna be,
wanna bewitch you
in the moonlight

Just wanna be,
I wanna bewitch you
all night.
