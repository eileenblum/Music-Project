[originally by ABBA]Youâre so free
Thatâs what everybodyâs telling me
Yet I feel Iâm like an outward bound
Pushed around refugee

Somethingâs wrong
Got a feeling that I donât belong
As if I have come from out of space
Out of place, like King-Kong

Iâm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
Iâm a marionette
Everybodyâs pet
Just as long as I sing
Iâm a marionette
See my pirouette
âRound and âround
Iâm a marionette
Iâm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Like a doll
Like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk
How to walk, how to fall

Canât complain
Iâve got no one but myself to blame
Somethingâs happening
I canât control
Lost my hold, itâs insane

Iâm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
Iâm a marionette
Everybodyâs pet
Just as long as I sing
Iâm a marionette
See my pirouette
âRound and âround
Iâm a marionette
Iâm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Look this way
Just a little smile
Thatâs what they say
Youâll look better on the photograph
If you laugh, thatâs OK!!

Iâm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
Iâm a marionette
Everybodyâs pet
Just as long as I sing
Iâm a marionette
See my pirouette
âRound and âround
Iâm a marionette
Iâm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Youâre so free
Thatâs what everybodyâs telling me
Yet I feel Iâm like an outward bound
Pushed around refugee
