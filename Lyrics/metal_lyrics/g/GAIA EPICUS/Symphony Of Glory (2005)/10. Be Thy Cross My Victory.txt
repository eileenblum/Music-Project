[Words &amp; music by Hansen]

A fire is burning in the night
The stars are shining so bright
It's always a silence before the storm
But when hell breaks loose the rage is born

Listen to the voices inside you
They will guide you and show you the way

We are far away from home
We come from beyond the sun
We fight for freedom my friend
And we'll stand by you until the end

A warrior is razing his sword
Screaming I will die for my lord
The sound of steel and metal is so loud
Raise your head look ahead and be proud

Be thy cross my victory, let me live for eternity

Requiem, Aternaem. Dona Eis Domine
Dans La Glorie, De Ton Ciel
(Almighty god, give us eternal rest, be thy cross my victory)

Time is changing world is burning
Clock is ticking still we're not learning
World is dying people are crying
Have we all just gone insane?
