[Words &amp; music by Hansen]

The years are passing by me
The world will change around me
And life will always be a big illusion

So hard to be a part of
A life that's so confusing
To many things is going on inside of me

I fly on my own
I decide where to go
I have finally found
My own wings of freedom

I speak up my mind
I am no longer blind
I have finally found
My own wings of freedom

To many times of sorrow
To many lies to swallow
I'm breaking loose now and I'm not coming back again

I feel the wind around me
I see the world below me
It's like I'm born again and finally I'm free
