[Words &amp; music by Hansen]

So the day did come, when we got our chance to show the world
That we can be apart, so with this contract we did start
With no cash with no loans, we where making it on our own
But very soon it got dark, it seemed like it all would fall apart

Is there no one who can help us now?
Are we lost? Are we out of the game?

Will there be no release? Aaaah ah ah ah

We had a deal but no it's gone, we cannot finish what we've begun
This cant be right, this must be wrong, where is this hell now coming from?
So very close but still so far, will you help us to heal this scar?
Time runs fast no hope in sight, our dream was fading in the night

There was a light that we did see, was it dream or reality?
We must be strong and carry on, because it's here that we belong
But suddenly the things did change, we would break out from our chains
And finally we did see, the end of eternity

Finally we where seeing the end
Finally it would be a release
