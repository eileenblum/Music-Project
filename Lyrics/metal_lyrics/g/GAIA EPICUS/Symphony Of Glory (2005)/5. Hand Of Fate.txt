[Words &amp; music by Hansen]

If I could walk into the fire
If I could walk right through the storm
If you could see my dark desire
You would be dying but not alone

If I could stop the world from burning
If I could rescue everyone
If you could see me in the mirror
You would be crying all alone

Out there, somewhere
The reasons for everything
Searching, falling
Deep into your heart

The Hand of fate, is never late
It will strike right from the sky
You can try to run, but you can not hide
From the hand of fate

Is there a place without no sorrows?
Is there a place where we can start?
To try an make a new tomorrow
Or will it all just fall apart?

If we all stand together
If we all are ready to fight
There will be a new tomorrow
Because our hope is burning bright
