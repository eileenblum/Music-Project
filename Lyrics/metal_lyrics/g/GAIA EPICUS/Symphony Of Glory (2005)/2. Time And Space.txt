[Words &amp; music by Hansen]

The words I hear is calling out again
They creep inside the darkness of my brain
I'm falling down but cannot touch the ground

The stream of light is closer than I see
Can I escape from my own destiny?
Or am I trapped inside for eternity?

Travel through time and space we will help you survive
Watching the years fly by
If we could start again would you help us my friend
Or would you not dare to try

Something's must change before it is too late
The time is right we gotta have some fate
We take a journey into the past

We see the things that man have done before
The evil the terror the destruction of it all
Is this really worth fighting for?

In the dark you will rise up to light the fire again
In the quest for a reason to start all over again

Lost in time the world is falling everything is falling apart
No escape from the terror that looks you in the eye

Travel through time and space we will help you survive
Travel to a distant place, a journey to save mankind
