[Words &amp; music by Kjelstad]

Why do we have to live this way?
This is no way of living
Can we find another day without hunger and deceiving?
Is there life for all of us?
I think that we can make it
Understand the meaning to life, death and spirit

In a world of war and crime
We are hoping for salvation
Out of the ashes we will rise, to fight for every nation
Like the eagle in the sky
We see the glance of sunrise
The morning glory for us all, we are standing tall

One day we'll live forever for one and all together
We all will see the light when we will seize the day
