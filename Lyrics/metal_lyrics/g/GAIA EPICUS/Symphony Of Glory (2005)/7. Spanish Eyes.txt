[Words by Hansen, Kjelstad / music by Kjelstad]

The first time I ever saw your face
I felt something in my heart
A feeling that I never knew before
Could this be a brand new start?

I was lost in your eyes
Could you be the sun of my life?
I thought that I never could
Have someone like you

She made me feel so funny
The feeling was so strange
I love her very easy, It will never change

She's the one that I would love, to have and know that I
Have met my Sweetie pie
All the days that has gone by, my love will never die
For her my Spanish eyes

The days with you are the best I have had
I hope we will have many more
My life has changed but I'm still the same
The Joker and friend for all

I 'am lost in your eyes
Cause you are the sun of my life
I thought that I never could
Have someone like you

Oh how she looks
Oh how she smells
I feel a tingling in my bells

She's the one that I now love, I have her and I see
That she's the one for me
All the days that has gone by, my love will never die
For you my sweetie pie
My Spanish eyes

Oh my love it is so true, and it is just for you
The love I've never knew
Hear these words and you will see, the only one for me
Is you my Spanish eyes
