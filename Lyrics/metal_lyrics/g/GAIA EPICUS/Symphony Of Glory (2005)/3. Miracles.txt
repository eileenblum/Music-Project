[Words &amp; music by Hansen]

Far to long I have been alone, will I end my life tomorrow?
I have tried to keep on going on, but all I get is sorrow

No one hears my cry

I believe in miracles but will they ever hear me
They seem to be so far away and never coming near me
Will it ever be my turn and will I ever see them
Cause the miracles that I have seen has never been for me

A voice inside is telling me to stay, but it's very hard to do it
I'm afraid of loosing my mind, if I don't find a solution to it

I believe in miracles cause finally they heard me
They used to be so far away but now they are near me
Finally it was my turn and finally I saw them
Cause the miracles that I have seen has always been for me
