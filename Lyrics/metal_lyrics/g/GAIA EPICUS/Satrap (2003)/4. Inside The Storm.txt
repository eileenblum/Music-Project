[words &amp; music by Thomas C. Hansen]

Hear the thunder, see the lightning
Feel the rain comes poring down
Hear my heart beat, see my anger
Feel the force that strikes you down

You've betrayed me, for the last time
Now you must pay for your sins
Kneel before me, say you're sorry
Close your eyes and feel the pain

I am trapped again

Inside the storm
We can fly away to the unknown
If you're cold, ill keep you warm
You are safe inside the storm

See the moonlight, hear the voices
You can hear them calling you
Cannot answer, life is fading
There is nothing you can do

Someone's crying, someone's trying
To keep the life in you
Now you're sorry, but it's too late
This is the end for you

You are safe inside
You will join the ride
You are safe inside the storm
