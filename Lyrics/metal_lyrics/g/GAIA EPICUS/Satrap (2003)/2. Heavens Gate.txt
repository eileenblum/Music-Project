[words &amp; music by Thomas C. Hansen]

Rain is falling down, All over your grave
Hope is all I've got, keeps me from going insane

There is a place far beyond
Where you can go to get the strength to carry on

Fly far away, to the heavens gate
There you can rest in peace
Fly away, to the heavens and you'll find
It's time for you to leave this world behind

Pain is all I feel, and I just can not believe
What I see in front of me, your angel is coming for me
