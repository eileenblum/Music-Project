[words &amp; music by Thomas C. Hansen]

It's early in the morning
And the birds are singing high in the sky
I'm watching the sun arise
For the first time I am feeling alive

I never saw the sign, that the world would come to an end
I could never understand, why we all couldn't live in peace

We don't have much time
We all have to leave the world behind

When fire melts the ice
The only hope is here in paradise
When fire melts the ice
Nothing lasts forever
When fire melts the ice

A thunder storm is coming
The water is rising, there's no way out
A fire is still burning
But very soon it all will be lost

I can never forget, all the times that we spent together
I will never regret, that I took a chance and met a stranger

We still have each other
Cause we made it through the storm
