[words &amp; music by Thomas C. Hansen]

Do you remember the time when I was afraid and alone
You took me into the light and showed me the way back home
But the memories are still haunting my mind
I try to run away but they are taking me back in time

Freedom calls for you my friend
Freedom calls for you again
Forever time has stood still
And now it's time to break free

Do you remember the time when the enemy came to our land
They tried to kill all of us but we had a much better plan
We led them into our trap and killed them one by one
And when the battle was done our freedom we had won

From this hole in the ground I have crawled
For so long I've been cold
Now I'm out and a free man I am
I'll never be a slave again
Never be a slave again
I am free, and I owe it all to them
All the young brave men
