[words &amp; music by Thomas C. Hansen]

Riding down the valley of the Kings
I hear the song of a thousand years
Once you've seen the things that I have seen
Your soul will die if your mind's not clean

In the valley of the kings
Steel meets steel once again
In the shadow you will find
All the victims left behind

For a thousand years they've been coming here
To spill their blood for the King
You can hear the sounds of the fighting men
Who gave their lives again and again

Die for your King
And the land of the free
And the right to believe
The ancient code
Will still carry on
As long as you're heart is real

Die for your king
And the land of the free
Hear the people sing
Die for your King
