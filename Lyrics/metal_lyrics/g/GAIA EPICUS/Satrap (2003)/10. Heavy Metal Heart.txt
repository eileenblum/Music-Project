[words &amp; music by Thomas C. Hansen]

The night time has come
The lights are out
It's time to scream and shout

Once we go on
And start to play a song
We all know where we belong

It's time to go wild again, it's time to thrash all around
It's time to wake up again, to the loud and heavy sound

Heavy metal is in my heart and soul
Heavy metal is in my blood
Forever the music will live on
Forever it carry's on
Heavy Metal Heart

We enter the stage
Like a dog in a cage
waiting to be released

Grinding our teeth
And we're banging our heads
We all go insane tonight
