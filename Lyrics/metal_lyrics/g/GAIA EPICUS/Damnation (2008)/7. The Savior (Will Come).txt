Another day goes by, another desperate cry
A million souls will burn in a lake of fire
When all we had is lost, no more winter frost
A million souls will burn in a lake of fire

Is this the point of no return?
Is it too late for us to learn?
Is this the day that we will pay?
Will it all fade away?

The savior, will save us, our savior, will save us
The savior, he will come

Inside this empty shell, a soul is hidden well
A million dreams will burn in a lake of fire
Forgotten how to love, but remembers how to hate
A million hearts will burn in a lake of fire

Now I see there's another way to get out from this hell we created
All we must do is to change our ways and we all must stand together
