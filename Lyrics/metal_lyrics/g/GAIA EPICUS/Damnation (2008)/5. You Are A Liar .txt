No more blood will flow when I get the power
Everyone will have the right to say what they want
No more! No more illusions you will hear the truth this time
Just give me your vote and I will save your soul

Falling into the same trap again
Never learning so hear me when I say
You are a liar!

I see you on my TV, I hear the things you say
Bla bla bla bla, bla bla bla bla bla
You keep making promises that you will never keep
Corruption is the game but I don't want to play

Liar, liar, pants on fire!

You are a liar and liars will fall
Your aiming higher but I'm gonna take you down
