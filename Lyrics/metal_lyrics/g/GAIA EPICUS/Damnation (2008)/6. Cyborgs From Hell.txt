So what we've feared has begun
It's the end of the world this is the end
Now they will cry out in fear
The metal machines are taking control

Save us, save us
We don't want to die
Fear them, see them
Falling from the skies

It's a cyber world and it's out of control
There is no more places to hide
We created them to serve and protect
But now we all will die, Ooh ho hoo
Cyborgs from hell

They are human machines
Metal and flesh combined into one
A brain from a human was tried
What a mistake, now we will die

There will be no one alive
One by one we all shall die
