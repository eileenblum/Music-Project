The heat from the sun, we face a global warning
It's only just begun, it's time to choose or we will loose

There'll be no place to call our home, the earth will fade away
There's no place to run away when the firestorm is here

Bright light burns your eyes, no more roses, no paradise
There will be no escape from the firestorm

A tornado of fire is burning everything
The massive monster of flames, leaving only ashes behind
