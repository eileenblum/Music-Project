No more illusions, break down the walls
Here comes the truth, crushing at your balls
Oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall

So many signs, so many warnings
You tried to let us know, we didn't want to see it
Oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall

Damnation, the mankind will fall
Damnation, we have doomed us all
Damnation, there's no return
Damnation, It has come to watch us burn

The world is getting warmer, the climate is changing
Pollution of the sky, is this how we shall die?
Oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall

Time is running out, it will soon be too late
We better act right now, cause tomorrow it's to late
Oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall

"As the world starts to fall"
"Darkness will come"
"All forms of life will disappear"
"And our failure will be complete"

Damnation of the world
The final hour is here
Destruction, horror and pain
All hope is lost

All we need is one more hero
To ride out from the dark and save us all
