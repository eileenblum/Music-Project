Now we all stand together
To fight for the right to live
The air will be cleaner than ever
We can breathe without getting a disease

From the dark he will come
And save everyone
Healing the world with his power
All the shadows will go
And we all will know
That now salvation is here

Hate is something that we don't need
We must learn to all get along
Years of fighting will finally end
And they will see that there was no point at all

Salvation is here
Coming out from the dark
The day has finally come
Will he will save everyone?
