You feel that all hope has gone
There's nothing more to loose
You see that the world falls apart
And every day is the same

No more feeling sadness
No more hurting pain
No more tears like rain
No more people dying
No more endless fighting
No more emptiness

There's a hero in all of us
One who will fight for all
No more darkness will blind us
Once again we'll be free
A hero in all

When all the passion has gone away
And you are feeling alone
Remember there is always someone out there
That feels the same as you do
