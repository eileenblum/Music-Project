Down in a hole, dirty and cold
Crawl through the mud and into the light
Fire below, faster we go
Now it is time, weâre gonna break free

The big wheels are turning
Over and over again

Now that we see all the horror and pain
We must walk through the darkness and rain
The sun we will see if we stand through the flood
Because we are bounded by blood

Over the wall, get out of sight
Never give up without a fight
Tormented souls, crying in pain
Now is the time weâre gonna break free
