Stars are shining so far away
Even though they died a long time ago
The world is only a tiny place
In a universe that still is unknown

Are we the only ones? (in this universe alone?)
Is our mission here undone?

Far beyond the galaxy, is there a place for you and me?
And if itâs true then I will follow
The world has served me pretty well, but has now turned into a hell
So I'll be leaving here tomorrow

Fear is filling my heart and soul
But I know it all will fade when we reach our goal
Letâs go! We fly with the speed of light
To a destination that is still unknown

Beyond the universe, destiny will call
Beyond the universe, a future for us all
Forever going on, until we find this place
Beyond the universe, we know there is a place that we can call home

Where do we go from here my friend,
is this the beginning or is it the end?
