Doors are closing, system fails
The final curtain is now falling down
Take a bow and say goodbye
The lights go off for the very last time

No more great reviews
No more applause

Falling down it seems like there is no ground
Don't know how I ended up this way
On the edge is where I spent most of my time
Falling deep into the abyss again

Liquid shadows on the wall
The show is over and the audience is gone
Empty rooms and empty chairs
The theatre of life is ending here

Coming back from the beyond
I see that people have been moving on
Thinking that I might be forgot
But my memory lives on forever more
