Staring at the wall, I see the shadow fall
Is there someone at the door? Have I been in here before?
Voices calling, please donât let them take me
Voices calling, thereâs no place to hide
Darkness falling, terror creeps inside me
Darkness falling, the smell of death arrives

Behind these walls, tears are falling
Behind these walls, every day feels like there's no tomorrow
Behind these walls, the darkness is moving
Behind these walls, here you shall stay forever more

My heart is slowing down, as I lay here on the ground
When I take my final breath, I close my eyes and welcome death

What happened to me?
Am I dead?
Is this really the end?
Can I go back?
Please let me go!
Please, please let me go!
