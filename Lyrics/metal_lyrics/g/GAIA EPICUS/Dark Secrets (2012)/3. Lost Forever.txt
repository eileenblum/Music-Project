In my heart, in my soul
There is a darkness that could unfold
Hold it back, push it down, donât release his evil crown
Itâs a king, itâs a god, it wantsâ control over my blood

Can you hear me now?
Or are you lost forever?
Trapped inside of your mind
Can you see me now?
Or are you blinded forever?
Please donât leave us all behind

In my mind, there is something wrong
I can feel it, it wonât be long
Hold it back, push it down, donât release his evil crown
Itâs a king, itâs a god, it wantsâ control over my blood

No more light, no more me
I have redrawn myself, and ceased to be
You let it out, you let it loose, the evil crown he now will use
Itâs a king, itâs a god, it has control over my blood
