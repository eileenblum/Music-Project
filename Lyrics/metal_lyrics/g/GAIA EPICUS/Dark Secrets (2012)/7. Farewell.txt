There is a voice deep inside, and itâs telling me to go
Far too long I have tried to heal, but I know itâs time for a change

Hold on to your dreams, donât ever let them fade away
Because you only got one life
Even though I'm leaving here today, I wonât forget about yesterday
And you will always be in my heart
But this is farewell

All the years I spent with you, is something I will never regret
Your memory will never die, but now itâs time to say goodbye
