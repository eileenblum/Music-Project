They are calling from far away
The voices are crying for help
and I have to leave tonight

I am flying through a thunderstorm
Navigating in the night
I'm diving from the rain

I am the Raven, king of the sky
Show me the reasons to live or let die
Falling from heaven, a master of flight
I am the Raven fear me tonight

I am the Raven

Below I can see my destiny
Up in the sky looking down at my pray
as they run away

I am gliding silently
Trough the air, down to earth
you'll never hear me come
