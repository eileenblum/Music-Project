Words are pouring from your mouth again
Friendly eyes is smiling, wants to be your friend
There is a beast behind the mask that is ready to attack
Once you walk into his trap he will watch your neck snap

Falling down into the trap, there is no way out for you

Hellfire, burn burn, we wanna watch you burn

Always waiting for another one to come
Starts out friendly and then they break you when itâs done
Like a cat whoâs playing with a mouse thatâs on the run
They chase you down and bring you back to finish whatâs begun
