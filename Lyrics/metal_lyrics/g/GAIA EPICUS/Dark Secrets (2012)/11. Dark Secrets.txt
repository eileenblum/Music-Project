Behind the perfect smile lurks the dark
A twisted mind who likes control
Inside the kindness you'll find hate
A heart of ice and no remorse

Wake up the world and realize what is wrong
Open up your eyes and see all the things that are going on
Find the things that we have lost in a world so cold and grey
When you see something you don't like don't turn the other way

In a cage born and raised, is that right?
The only purpose is to please our greed
Man plays god and can do anything, is that right?
We only see what we want to see, yeah that's right!
