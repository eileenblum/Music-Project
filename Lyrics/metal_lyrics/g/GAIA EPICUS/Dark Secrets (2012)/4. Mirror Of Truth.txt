Once your born you start to die
From the air that keeps you alive
As you grow it's hard to stay true
To yourself and the people around you

Searching, for the answers to it all
Sometimes you may wish that you had never been born at all

Creating a wall, afraid you're gonna fall
You don't want anyone else to see the same as you do,
when you look into
The mirror can tell, even though you hide it well
You don't want anyone else to see the same as you do,
when you look into the mirror of truth

Hate, hate I see it in your eyes
even though you're wearing a disguise
I told you once, I told you twice
I am the truth, I am the real you
