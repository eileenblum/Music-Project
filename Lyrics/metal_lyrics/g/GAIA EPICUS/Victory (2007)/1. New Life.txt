[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

I feel it, I hear it, I see but can't believe it
I fear it, I've tried it, and now I'm free at last

We seem to have lost the
Will to give a helping hand
But it's not to late to make a change

A new life has begun (From the darkness he rise)
Through the years I have learned to live with the pain
As the story unfolds (He reveals all his past)
All the secrets is out a new life has begun

The hard times, the sadness, it's hard to live and learn
You face it, cant race it, you just have to take your time
