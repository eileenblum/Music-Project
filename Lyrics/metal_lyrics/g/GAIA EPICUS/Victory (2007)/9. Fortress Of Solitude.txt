[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

Inside of this soul there is not much control
When the walls are falling down
There is no one to help you when you need it most
You got to stand your own ground

Fortress of Solitude
Fortress of crime
Fortress of Solitude
Don't waste my time

Pictures are flashing and burning my brain
How can I focus with all of this pain?
Noises are creeping inside of my ear
How can I live my life when all I feel is fear?

In good times and bad times you are there for me
The one that I care for but no one can see
The shadow is dancing a warrior's dance
This time I wont make it, I don't have a chance

Fortress of Solitude
You can't win
I won't go down
So don't waste my time
