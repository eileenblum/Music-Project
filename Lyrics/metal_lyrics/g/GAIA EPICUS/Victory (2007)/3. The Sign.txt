[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

Tonight I'm gonna leave this town behind
Gonna pack my things and then I'll say goodbye
Tomorrow a new journey will begin
The iron bird will carry me with the wind

As I start to walk away
You take my hand and then I'll say

Every time when I am away from you
I feel alone and I am missing you
So far away but still you are close to me
In the stars I see your sign
No matter where I go will you wait for me?
Even if it will be for eternity?
A million miles away but I will return
Cause in the stars I see your sign

Tomorrow I am far away from home
Seeing places I have never seen before
So many men have travelled here before
And many will travel here once more

As my journey finally ends
I'll return to my friends
