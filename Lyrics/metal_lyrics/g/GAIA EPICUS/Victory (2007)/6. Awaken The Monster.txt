[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

I'm the ice man
I am the assassin,
I'm just a killer that kills for fun

He had a though childhood
He never knew love
Should we forgive him? Feel sorry for him? No!

Awaken The Monster
It never ever sleeps
It's waiting for the next victim
The hunger never stops

I kill for no reason
Look at me the wrong way
And you will die a slow and painful death
