[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

Brothers of metal unite
It's time to stand up and fight
Let our voices be heard
Forever and for more

Lift the flag up high
Wave it in the sky
Cause metal never dies
It will lead us to Victory

Together we build a force
Stronger than steel stronger than all
Tonight we are all in the crowd
There's no turning back it's gonna be loud

Brothers of metal unite
