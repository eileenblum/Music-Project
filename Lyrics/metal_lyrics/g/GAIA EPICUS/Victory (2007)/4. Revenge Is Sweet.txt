[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

You thought you could do it again
Just change what you want but never ask
This time you have gone to far
There's no turning back you'll have to pay

Revenge is sweet

A contract was written in gold
But turned out to be nothing more than shit
You can take this piece of paper
And show it up your ass you piece of thrash

Paragraph 04 in the contract, broken
Paragraph 09 in the contract, broken
Paragraph 14 in the contract, broken
Paragraph 17 in the contract, broken
