[Words &amp; Music: Hansen]

Beware of the iron curtain
Once it fall you will never get out
Never close the door to your heart
Cause it won't fade away in the night

How could this happen to me?
I am strong, I am not weak

Ah ah The Iron curtain is falling
Ah ah And the walls are closing in
Ah ah The Iron curtain is falling
Ah ah My whole world is crumbling down
Down on me

Sitting trapped in a corner
Boiling sweat runs down my back
Shaking like an earthquake
As the anxiety attacks

The darkness surrounds me
The weight is heavy as hell
My mind is like a tornado
It's spinning inside of this well

I can't feel my arm anymore
And my chest hurts like hell
I am crying like a baby
And I am afraid I won't get well

It's the iron curtains
Don't let them fall

Here comes the iron curtain
