Rise of the Empire
The new world soon will come
Rise of the Empire
The war has just begun

Here he comes, the man behind the mask
He holds so much power, he holds the key to the world
He is no longer human, but a cyborg with no heart
Never turn, your back at this man
He holds so many secrets, he holds the truth of the sith
He once was a human, but now he's more machine

You will never see the light again
If you don't stand and fight
The dark side is growing powerful
But with the force we can take them all

Watch him fly, he's the fastest in the universe
He has always been a fighter, always been the one
But with the anger growing stronger, he gets closer to his fall

Watch it rise!
