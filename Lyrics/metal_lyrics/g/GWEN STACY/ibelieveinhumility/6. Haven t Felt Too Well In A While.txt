if ever your soul was gone

flames turn hollow and empty
drowned in rivers of tears
the ashes fall
buildings crumble

we were once great mountains
now we've fallen to wastelands
we've turned

tomorrow still remembers today
a day when everyone feels and everyone thinks

we'll say gone but not forgotten
we'll mean life's become extinct
we'll say gone

how cliche is this?
the age of sincere emotion has been killed
the age of sincere emotion is dead

to tell you the truth, i haven't felt too well in a while
