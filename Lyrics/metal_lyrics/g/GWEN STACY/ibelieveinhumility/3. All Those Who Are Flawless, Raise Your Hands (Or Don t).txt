i have never seen such fickle sets of morals
i'm just a failure, i made the worst disease
this is your goodness, return to family

honestly this will never end
we stand in line

this is your answer, recall your dying days
goodbye my darling, to swim these endless seas

then compete to see who can recite these lines the loudest

the barrier falls down

you liar
you lie

correctness is in no way connected to the volume of your voice

you dance around your dead
like Kamikaze planes, we're falling down, down, down
