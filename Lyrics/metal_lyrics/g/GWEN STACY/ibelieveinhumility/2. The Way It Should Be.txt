this is goodness, this is selflessness
open chested
your eyes in mine

when one turns cold
the others make a fire
you try to run away
you can't escape the warmth

this is family
this is pure
and my death comes before a single hair on your head is harmed
i love you

this is what you do for the ones you love

to the gates, or to your knees

my beating heart is just a canvas for your name
write it down
return it to the sky

falls like ashes
