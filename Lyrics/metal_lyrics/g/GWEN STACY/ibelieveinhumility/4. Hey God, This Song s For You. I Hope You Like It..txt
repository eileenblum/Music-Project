why do we fall?
so we can learn to pick ourselves up again
it starts with a prayer
it ends with a fight

come and get it
i'm right here
come and get it

without a jump, there is no fall
without a jump, there is no fall
without a jump, no one to catch you

if the world should fall around me
i would still be standing, i would still be free
no one to hold me
no one to keep me here
this is the last time
have no fear

oh yeah
get ready

why do we fall?

my time is here for you my dear

this is a matter of life and death, the dreamer will choose life
this is what it means to live and die by your dreams

take control of your life
find your peace with God and shoot from the hip

who will fight?
who will live?
who will die?
