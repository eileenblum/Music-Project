this world in flames
take my life (throw it in)

we're not dead, still breathing
you said we'd never stop bleeding

you can't stop me, i will destroy memories
you can't stop me, i will destroy

this time you won't have a smile on your face
it's time to prove ourselves worthy

arise, shine, (spread your wings) take flight
arise, shine

make this cloud your resting place
(set this whole world on fire)
this town can hold us no longer
(oh my God)

my God
my Refuge

we will move on (we'll rise above this fire)
we'll turn our backs to the wreckage
