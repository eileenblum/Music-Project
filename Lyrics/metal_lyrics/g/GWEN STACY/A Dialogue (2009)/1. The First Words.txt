Don't let them make you think your doubt is disbelief.
It's time you finally listen to the things I have to say.
I've been talking with no response.
It's time for your attention.
Are you ready to listen?
Now listen for what you've missed every time before.

In this conversation with the known unknown,
Mouth shut, eyes wide, ready and willing.

I've let open the skies this very night.

I'll sit and wait while the stars they take their time.
Because I'm starved with empty hands, and I've been a broken man
Oh pilot of pilots come fly me home.
I'm coming to say goodnight.
If I have one more day to live.
Then I have one more day to fight.
Sometimes it's just too hard to make myself believe,
that you'll catch me when I fall.

Don't let them make you think your doubt is disbelief.

I'm not about to pretend to be something that I'm not.
