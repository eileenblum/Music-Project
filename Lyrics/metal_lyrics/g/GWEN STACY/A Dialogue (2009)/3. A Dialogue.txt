"I have become so bitter that it has reached my core. 
I have become so bitter that it has reached my core, 
but every day brings a battle that I canât win. 
Still it seems that I have all my drones in a row...in a row. 
So I will drown myself in holy water, and call myself at home. 
Iâll drown myself in holy water, and call myself at home. 
Can this be happening? Let me know when to feel, 
and when to live my life again. 
Iâve tried my best to overcome. 
All that I truly have I will lay at Your feet. 
I swear this better be worth it. 
Itâs been three hundred days of cold, and I am so alone. 
What can I make of this? What can I make of this? 
Oh me of little faith. Overtaken by mind and thought. 
I canât believe how far Iâve come, 
but it has taken so many steps to get here."

"You speak your doubts in hope of finding 
something that I have not already seen. 
There are things that are so much greater 
than your heart could truly understand."

"Youâve got me out on my hands and knees, 
but Iâm a faithful son to no one. 
I bury loved ones in memories. 
Guide me as I walk over their ashes. 
I burn my bridges to the ground with failure as my road. 
I burn my bridges to the ground with failure as my road. 
Can this be happening? 
Let me know when to feel, and when to live my life again. 
Iâve tried my best to overcome. 
All that I truly have I will lay at Your feet. 
I swear this better be worth it. 
Itâs been three hundred days of cold, and I am so alone. 
I swear this better be worth it. 
Itâs been three hundred days of cold, and I am so alone. 
What can I make of this? What can I make of this?"

"This is the real world, and youâre falling apart (and youâre falling apart).
