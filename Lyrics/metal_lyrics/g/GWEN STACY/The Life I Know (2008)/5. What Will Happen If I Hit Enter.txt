Looks like I'm stuck here once again
With a thought on my mind, I stare at your open face

Every time I feel as though I try
I fail and no one wants to be a failure

I've had the wrong impression this whole time
And now we're the ones to blame

All I want to do is try
Want to
Pour my heart out for ones to read
Want to
Pour my mind for ones to hear
Want to
Drain my thoughts so everyone
Will have
Something to call their own

Here is the life I know
Here is the life I know

I won't stop till I have your attention
Till I have your attention

This life is now my explanation
You are proof that love is real
Tell me what I have to give
You are proof that love is real

So talk with me as I move my mouth
I'm pouring my heart out
Enough for you to see

These are my words
I want you to know them
I want you to sing them
I want you to feel  
Pour my heart out for ones to read
Pour my mind for ones to hear
Drain my thoughts so everyone

Here is the life I know
Here is the life I know
