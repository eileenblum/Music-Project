How long can you tread water
With no option to sink or swim
How long can you tread water
With no option

We run in circles
Chasing our shadows
On a track that leads to nowhere
I'll pay the price for apathy
Is it me
Is it me
Is it me

Suddenly there is a spark, then a flame,
Then a fire that surrounds me
That surrounds me

Into this dark world I carry this spark
Into this dark world I carry this spark

For I refuse to let my faith go unseen
For I refuse to let my faith go unseen

I made my choice
I'll take a chance
Don't wait for me

No slowing down
No turning back
Don't wait for me

The cross before me road behind me
No turning back
Though no one joins me still I follow
No turning back

I made my choice
I'll take a chance
No turning back
I made my choice
I'll take a chance
No turning back

It's about time we stand for something
It's about time we stand for something
It's about time we stand
It's about time we stand for something
