Down, down again 
My day has come
A captive of my fate

Where are you now?

A dark cloud approaches
Donât let me go 
Not now, not ever 
Donât let me go

When will I see the sun again 

Swallow your pride, let me lift you up 
so I can make you whole again (whole again)
Youâre not dead (I'm not dead)
I'm not dead  
My son your not alone
My son your not alone

Crawl in humility before you walk in honor

There is a world of deceit in all of us 
There is a world of deceit in all of us 

When will I see the sun again 

Swallow your pride, let me lift you up 
so I can make you whole again (whole again)
Youâre not dead (I'm not dead)
I'm not dead  
My son your not alone
Swallow your pride
I'll make you whole again
Youâre not dead (I'm not dead)
I'm not dead  
My son your not alone
My son your not

All is not lost yet 
I am not dead yet
All is not lost yet 
I am not dead yet
