What do you have to accomplish
When you talk less of your maker
What riches you receive

Will do you no good in your place of rest
When it's the time to go

Tell me once again why I'm here
I've done nothing, to receive nothing

Don't wait for me no 
Don't wake me up (Don't wake me up)
Cause I'm a ghost (Cause I'm a ghost)
A ghost with no footprints
I have retreated so far into my own skin
(Fully awake yet fully asleep 
Dreaming my life away)
How long can I live like this (I live like this)

I've got nothing but trust in you
So please carry me to this spot
A place to call home

Make an effort to change your ways
Or your ways will change you

Because I'm carved on the inside
Just a cage of bones to hold
I'm empty on the inside
Fill me with a love to show

Don't wait for me no 
Don't wake me up (Don't wake me up)
Cause I'm a ghost (Cause I'm a ghost)
A ghost with no footprints
I have retreated so far into my own skin
(Fully awake yet fully asleep 
Dreaming my life away)
How long can I live like this (I live like this)

Death has taken over me
But only as an absence
I'm hollowed on the inside
Turn me upside down and shake till the bones fall out
Try me on fit me for size
Use my body as you will

Maybe this time I'll be the one
To control my shakes instead of
Letting my body be my soul
Letting my body be my soul

Make an effort to change your ways
Or your ways will change you
Make an effort to change your ways
Or your ways will change you
