Put yourself on display
You call yourself pure

Maybe we should face the wall,
Close our eyes and kiss ourselves goodbye
One more fight
There is a good chance I might die
If I'm not already dead on the inside
Tell me how I'm going to feel

Hanging heads and teary eyes
Shining smiles and polished lies
How many times can we change ourselves
Before we disappear completely

Let me out of this mess
No one has a reason to act this way
Let me out of this mess

"I must a been so blind"
Save your trust for the ones you can fool

This is family! This is pure!
This is family! This is pure!

Save your trust for the ones you can fool

You don't have a clue what family is all about
You liar you snake you lie you lie
You liar you snake you lie you lie

You call yourself pure
You call yourself pure

Maybe we should face the wall,
Close our eyes and kiss ourselves goodbye

Hanging heads and teary eyes
Shining smiles and polished lies
How many times can we change ourselves
Hanging heads and teary eyes
Shining smiles and polished lies
Before we disappear
