While I wait
Today's the day for approach
Today's the day that I give for the first time
Inside there's nothing else for me
Inside there's nothing else

Where else could I go to find myself?
I'm heading out where I belong
Where else could I go to find myself?
I'm heading out
I'm heading out

I'll take a step
I'll make a step
I'll take a step for truth
I'll make a step for my life

While I wait
Today's the day for approach
Today's the day that I give for the first time
Inside there's nothing else for me
Inside there's nothing

We'll break our necks so we won't look back
We'll break our necks so we won't look back

I am free
If killing yourself is the way to change
Let's go to war

And in all of this
All I wanted was peace
Look at all I've done

Just silence now
What is this I see?
I'll call this bet with my own life
Was this even for me?
Was this even for me?
Just silence now
What is this I see?
I'll call this bet with my own life
Was this even for me?
Just past the edge
A simple move to make
My hands begin to shake

And in all of this
All I wanted was peace
Peace
I close my eyes and feel the water just beneath my feet

Step out onto the water
Stop staring at the waves
Step out onto the water
Stop staring at the waves
