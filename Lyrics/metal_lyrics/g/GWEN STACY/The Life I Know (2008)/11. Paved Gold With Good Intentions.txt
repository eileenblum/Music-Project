I pray that these words reach deep enough to find your heart
I have someone else, someone much more than me, above
This time, this time
This time itâs me
I am completely unprepared for the way life turned on me

I cannot stand
I cannot stand alone
I cannot stand
I cannot stand alone

I am the one
the only one that Youâre afraid of
I am the one
the only one that Youâre afraid of

I am only a human, and I am only worshipful
Iâm not the man I was once before, it has taken itâs toll
Believe it, the best laid plans of mice and men go wrong
This has consumed me

This time itâs me
I am completely unprepared for the way life turned on me

I pray that these words reach deep enough to find your heart
I pray that these words reach deep enough to find your heart
I cannot stand
I cannot stand alone

I am the one, the only one that Youâre afraid of
I am the one, the only one that Youâre afraid of
