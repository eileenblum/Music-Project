Enter left those who have the nerve to play as God
Oh baby were going for a long ride now
Letâs turn out the shadow
And show them what weâre about
Iâve got some lines for you to hear

Hear them from the bottom of my heart

Is this what real men are made of?
Shifty eyes, crooked spines, and lies

Itâs so easy to know the right from wrong

Now run
Run before someone sees what you are
Run before you see for yourself

The selfish receive their own
The selfish receive their own

Iâve got smiles for miles and only I can play
Cause in this world its do or die
Lady youâll love the way I am
Cause lady Iâll make you mine

You may be the king of this town
But you have got the world to prove to me

From the moment you walked through the door
I knew Iâve seen you before
And your face looked oh so much different
But the fear was all the same

Judge me, hate me, love me, what is it going to be?
Judge me, hate me, love me, what is it going to be?
Is this what real men are made of?
Shifty eyes, crooked spines, and lies
But your face looked oh so much different
And the fear was all the same

The selfish receive their own
The selfish receive their own
The selfish receive their own
The selfish receive their own
