Set aside
Sent with no intent to return
What am I to expect
When I don't understand
Here is the life I know

When everything you know
Crumbles before your eyes
It becomes a battle to breathe
Under the weight of disappointment
The places I knew to be home seem strange
I feel the farthest from the ones I love the most

Set aside
Sent with no intent to return
What am I to expect, when I don't understand?

Still I know if I close my eyes and silence my heart
I can hear a voice quietly calling my name
Did you expect this to be easy?
Don't let yourself be fooled
Do you have the strength to move so to move the world

Never underestimate those with something to fight for
Convictions run deeper than blood
I see now that peace is but an illusion of safety
I see now that peace is but an illusion of safety

My complaints, my fulfillment
They are a distant memory
I am made whole in his love
I've finally learned to feel
And no one can take that away

You can not take that away
You can not ever take that away
Don't look for me to back down
Don't look for me to back down

You have the strength to move the world

Still I know if I close my eyes and silence my heart
I can hear a voice quietly calling my name
Did you expect this to be easy?
Don't let yourself be fooled
Do you have the strength to move so to move the world

You have one chance at life
You have one chance at life
You have the strength to move the world (to move the world)
Move the world
