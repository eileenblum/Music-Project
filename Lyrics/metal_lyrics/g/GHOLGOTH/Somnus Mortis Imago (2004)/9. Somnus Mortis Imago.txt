[The last text I wrote for this record cos I wanted to express strong and breathing material, which (almost) represents all those feelings and pictures-both old and new-I 've collected inside my nebulous well, and only waiting to be released or to be burnt down on paper. Every word of it (except  the end of the lyric,which is the continuation of "Absurdum")  is more than a simple " poetic" word.]

Whisper of Moth-wings
I see walls sweating blood
Mirror in Mirror
Virgin girl and Corvus corax
Daemons drawn by one line
The chopped-off hands of Durer blossom
Jesusface as negative
Forest of empty beds
A man falls on his knees, with a barrel of a gun under his chin
Neuroses bloom in Evanescene
The haemorrage of Sun on retinae
Hanged man on the apple tree
Feathers falling outside the Circle
The touch of Serpent's skin,while it's sliding out from the warm vagina

(a hallucination without any sense, an imitation of an apparition: "I walk among the crowd as wolf among sheep.Grotesque little beings appeare before me, pointing at a "hole" in the air. A black hole, like a paper burst through, floating in two dimension between earth and Nothing.This strange rent::the origin of  Ethereal Equilibrium.)

Body flayed, skin deprived
Just breathing Flesh, Tendon, Bone
My infinite blood dyes the white crowd of the Ziplipped
I touch them
Somnus Mortis Imago

Than the Hooded One bends down
And with fingers so beautiful
With fingers so cold, touches my forehead.

(Closure: Moon in Leo:
Gyermek, ki az angyal karjaiban szenderul,
Kinek arcan nyugalom s mosoly fenye feszul,
Gyermek, kinek mehe volt a tenger,
Arva almodozo, kit nem erthet meg ember.)

Thanks to black-gholgoth for sedning these lyrics.
