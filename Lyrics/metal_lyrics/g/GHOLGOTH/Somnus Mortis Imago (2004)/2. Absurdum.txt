[In medias res: ... a chilling,dark blue-toned vision,which is actually a  strong picture of a strange cruxifiction. Night is embraced by magickal aura, words fly through the air:]
["Fullmoon's light dancing on the hillside,]
[Where a tiny crowd marching so noisy and swarming like a beehive,]
[Going up to stand a third in between two crosses.]
[There's one dragger among them, whom will be surely crucified..."]

[But the text is a "bit" different...]

Ancient room- moist and dark
Yellow, timeless mildew on the walls.
In the centre a chair I sit
Walls:
With countless eyes overlaid,
Immense Eyes:(Numbers)
(It) hurts.

In a place foreign
(Where foreignity I feel not)
These eyes urged to watch me

when you' re pushed under water, and you know you have not enough air:

"Lungs adhered, nervepanic
So grotesque"
Through craft unseen
Staring fixed with no eyelids,
Just sitting in the wall
So large are they like human...

Heads.

As warmth fills my heart, a fever begins crawling,
Swelling slowly away in my shape,
Getting closer to my head,
To have it squashed.

The presence of fibrail engrams in gyrus:

Green hand-seems mucous
A tongue, in this palm's middle
Kisses one huge eye
Lick through with pleasure
Lick through with joy
Tastes good...
Cold
Saliva
Cold
Tranquil

Gazing hundreds of eyes
Piercing, bursting me
I can not hide, I'm lame, I think.
Nausea, Fever, Vacuum in the head
Yell- a parched throath
(Muteness.)
Tranquil cold,
Cold
I shiver, (it) hurts.

"Circumdederunt me gemitus mortis:
Dolores inferni, circumdederunt me.
Non omnis moriar."

Absurdum

Unconsciously I stand up
With slow treads I walk to the door
Like a scene of a motion picture
Where each move is gnawing...
Torture!
One Flash
Pain
One Flash
Dull hit on the chest...

[Intermezzo:]
I reach the door. Handle; turned. The door opens, then disappeares. Blinding Whiteness

Through the door of liberty
Out from here, to the white light,
From the room of eyes
To the light depraved.
I step into the crowd,
Into the ziplipped people,
Into the dead...

...to become dead.
