[I would rather enclose this short text, instead of my empty words...]

["When the celestial body begins the stellar agony, the inner core collapses into itself as a child breaks the shell of  a nut. Inside, vacuum comes into being and absorbs  the gas and debris clouds around the star. This stellar energy-accumulation grows untill all sources are empty, and than the pressure difference splits up the invisible caul of the supernova, in form of a great importance detonation, which lasts for a few seconds but destroys every thing around."]

In demonic lost
All is fragmented
Last-breath-shatters
Beyond the Nihil's caul
Closed door...
Closed windows, were they ever open?
( just a Voice sounds behind them)

A star burnt out on the sky
Wounding the Firmanent's skin
Glance arrival of light
It's already dead when we see it.
One star died.
Fallen

(in such a case every child wish something.)

Soul: like sponge
Smoke and a piece of tissue
Omnivore, voracious consumer
To stop is unknown
I see how man unites in the orgasm of Saturation
When Fire devours its own body
Screaming, speechless: "Enough."

A soul full of: Grief, Angst, Broken Toys, Venom, Fibrail Dementia, Souls...
...and all of you.
"Only Lust drives the soul."

(the coming of nausea, inner pulsation)
I'm here
Touch me
Come closer
Embrace me
(retching, and a stabbing ache in the eye)
I'm still here, I've got enough.

(and then the Voice sounded behind from the door and the windows and broke the glasswalls inside the head):
Kill yourself-Need to mutilate
Kill yourself-Kill your friends,family
Kill them all-the people around you
And then kill me.

"people,have you ever felt the power of a dead star?"
