Evil, dark Night
Thou fold thy arms over the sky
Thy claws like icicles, cold and cruel.

The wind fondles the crown of trees
As if they have an eye, in the middle
Of their rotten trunk.

Hundreds of eyes are watching me
Oh, how many haunting shadows
They have seen...

Evil, cold Night
Shadows are gliding in thy forest
Their formless bodies washed
By moonlight
I can see them...

I see those flames,
The Night stabbed me so deep with
His nails.
I feel like I'm dying again.

Mystic fire beings, you are so beautiful
Children of The Night,
I can see the hate in your eyes
Every torment lives in you,
Every sorrow dwells in you,
Where are your possessors?
Burning lonely spirits...

All in vain...
Everything dies which once beautiful was
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
The Death has accelerated
The thorn-wheel of Time,
The fiery scythe falls down...

Flaming shadows of the sore past
In your hand the light fades away
And Today becomes...
Catafalque mist

Everything seems so hopeless,
Everything is so gloomy and sad,
The only thing I know
That the Moon is my shelter,
The Moon is my home

Thanks to black-gholgoth for sedning these lyrics.
