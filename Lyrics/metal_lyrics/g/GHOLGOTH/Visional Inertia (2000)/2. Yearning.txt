Yearning...
 I can't cry,
All my tears disappeared.
The storm froze them on my face.
I'm walking on a path,
And gaze up to the blackened sky,
The stars are winking at me,
I feel the call of the Moon.
The attraction of infinity, runs in my blood
Takes me up like a black magnet.
Forever!
I leave this world behind,
Yet another is waiting for me...
My dark empire, where my life is not a misery.
I see the glowing stars,
They almost blind me.
The Thousand-eyed sky merges with me.
I feel the endless universe
And the cosmic power,
I am immortal...
...just stardust and ash...
Yearning...
