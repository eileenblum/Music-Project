We call out to you from this mire
Of no love and wrong desires
Our path to self realization
Lead to the soul's annihilation

With hearts like holes
We wander in confusion
Our famished souls
Wallow in delusions

A roar and we all fall
No chain restrains the beast
We have entered an abyss
The old speech of tongues now
Heretic's gospels best unsung
All values broken down
Into bitter frowns

Your spine stoops
Then a crack
A whip wielded by ones greed
It can't be held back
In the mire, in the mire

Beckoning fortune
Your pot of gold
No sense, no direction
You lost your soul
To the mire
You lost it all
To the mire
