Pass on the unleavened bread
Don't drink the bitter wine
You are not among the chosen
But soon you will receive what's coming

Christ comes through the window
Christ comes through the roof
Christ comes to kill sin
Christ comes in truth

Heavenly Father angry with his children
Sends his firstborn to kill them
High and low they will all fall
By the swords of Heavens Horde

Holy ground covered by dead religious
On the doors of the Sanctimonious
No mark of lamb's blood painted
Earth is cleansed, no longer tainted

Christ stands triumphant, hateful master
The lion's will is done, disaster
Man cannot suffer enough for his sins
Man cannot suffer enough for the nails.
