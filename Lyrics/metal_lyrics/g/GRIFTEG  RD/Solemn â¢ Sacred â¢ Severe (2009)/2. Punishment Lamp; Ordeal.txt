Sensations are lost
Flat-line of the mind
Radiant eye of the world storm
Calm as the glow of silver

Reign from heaven
Ripples not the stillness
Of the depths
Unto which I have fallen

Days like pearls lined
In a necklace of pain
Pearly gates to pain
Open wide

Punishment and ordeal
You sent me here
King coldness
Of no solace
While my brother's keeper
Won't let go

See me, I am here
Bleeding for you
My inner room
Vibrant with your sorrow

I see your light
As through tears
I lay a shadow
In your shadow

You sleep righteous
Above the throng
The orphan's choir unheard
Billions wailing, so alone
