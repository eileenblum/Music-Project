Jesus dies inside my heart
Judas lingers on
All my values broken down
In a bitter frown

A chain of deeds committed
Weigh heavy round my chest
It can not be broken
Only outstretched

Jesus dies inside my heart
While Judas lingers on
My heart has broken down
Pumping end time rhymes

I leave these words to discourage
See, I block my own path with stones
Drunk with wormwood I stumble
In lies entangled and alone
