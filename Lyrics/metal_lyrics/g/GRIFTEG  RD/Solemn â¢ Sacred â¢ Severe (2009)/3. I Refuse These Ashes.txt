I refuse these ashes
My mind's eye see, my mind's I
While the evidence of weakness
Is piling up in heaps
The filth of sweat and tears
Streaming from me
The greed and lust and all these fears
The lies and alcohol that drips
From my mouth, from my mouth

A mount Zion inside with a ceiling
Undying thirst for us dying children
I fail to ascend as I ponder infinity
Oh, endlessly

I refuse these ashes
My mind's eye see, my mind is I
While the evidence of weakness
Is piling up in heaps
The filth of sweat and tears
Streaming from me
The greed and lust and all these fears
The lies and alcohol that drips
From my mouth, from my mouth
