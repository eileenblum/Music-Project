Angels sang these words to me
Granting hope with a prophecy
The lord of mercy will return
To pour out his love, to burn

Great white mass in gospels sing
Joyous hymns for the King
The funereal psalm that is creation
Soon void of mans distortion

All things good though mostly bad
All the dreams we ever had
All the hate and little love we shared
Will be nothing, will be nothing

There will be silence, silence
Silence over the depths again
The dove will leave no ones hands
Just to find all empty lands
