I am no lover
I am no faultless man
Carry me closer
To where we once began 
Because the days now burn
Like fresh lit cigarettes
You pull me closer
With perfect spinnerets

I feel the seams about to split 
But you're wide-eyed and bushy-tailed
I won't be here forever

And I can feel it
Your eyes like rapid rivers
Move over me
Searching me
Like I can deal with it 
Like I can take in everything
And lose you too
(I know you can)

I am no fucking lover
I'm just a burning bridge
These holy rollers
They just don't stand a chance 
Because you speak so slow
In secret alphabets
You walk so tall now
On slender minarets

I am just a ghost
