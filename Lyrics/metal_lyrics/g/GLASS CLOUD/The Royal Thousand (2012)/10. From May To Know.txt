After all this time
It starts to feel like years inside

It gets to be just like a day on avalanche
These words are a slow romance
I don't believe you would say
Anything to lead me astray

Three thousand miles from here
And nothing helps bring it near

I know you can't understand
My empty hands
I know it's times like these
These things just make you insane

I'm on the front porch with my bags packed 
And where is my chariot?
I don't need golden wings
Just something that can make me free

Everything you say
It always adds another day 
We are all soldiers with loaded guns 
Ready for war
