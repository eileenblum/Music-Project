If you turn your head away
You will miss everything
(it's so sad)
It should mean everything
A love like this lost
And no remorse
"My son, it's just a burden of divorce"

Mark my words
I would drop everything
But a lie to the face
Is the ultimate way
Out of this

If you turn your head away
It might be easy to sleep
(but, it don't matter)
It festers underneath
The body just burns
Like open wounds
"My boy, there's just nothing left to do"

Like Oedipus
Like Laius
Like everything
