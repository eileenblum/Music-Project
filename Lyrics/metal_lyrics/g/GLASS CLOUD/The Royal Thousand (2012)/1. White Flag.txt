Stare if you stare
At the stars, the stars
They'll burn out and fall
In the fields that surround you

If you won't look up
If you keep your chin down

Raise the white flag
Just raise the white flag
If you're just gonna cave in

Just lay down and die
Just lay down and die

Trust me, trust me
I know you feel it deep down
Just breathe, just breathe
If you want it bad enough
It'll come to you

You're giving up all you are
Why do you need a thousand
Eyes pointing back at you?
Why do you want your
Name in the empty banner
Of those with naught to say?

I can see you slipping
I can see you slipping away again
I can see you drowning in the midnight tide
In the tide

I can see the sunlight
Pierce through the door
You are all the things
I choose to ignore

I am a starving man who does impossible things
And you can't see fire if you're standing in flames
Just raise the white flag

Trust me, trust me
I know you feel it deep down
Just breathe,

Just breathe
If you want it bad enough
It'll come to you
If you want it
It'll come to you
But you don't want it

I can see the sunlight
Pierce through the door
You are all the things

I choose to ignore

Trust me
Just raise the white flag
Just breathe
Just raise the white flag
Burn and fall
