Take it all slowly
I'm a slave to the scent of your skin
And you're so lovely
Under the touch of my tongue
And you bite your lips
When you make that face
Heaven between your hips
I stand at the pearly gates

I want everything you have to give to me
So just give it to me

And I wonder
What you might be thinking
Somewhere deep behind your eyes
When I lay you down
On the bed at night
And you look back at mine

Come to me late at night when no one's around
I am the falling rain and you are the ground.
