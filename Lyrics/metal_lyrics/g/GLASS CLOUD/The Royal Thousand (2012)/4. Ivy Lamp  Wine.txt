Was born the son of the god of gods
Eaten alive
Saved in my father's thigh
Twice born to a mortal mother
Shot down with lightning bolts
With open eyes in the face of glory

Torn apart
Limb from limb
Payback is a mother fucker

Underneath the spell
Of the semi-precious
Holy god of ceremonial madness
Cast into the charm
Of the halfway diety
Holy god of divine ecstasy

Where is the new wine?
Dying on the vine
I want roses in my garden

I cam back to the motherland
To prove I am who they say I am
The moonstruck women
And elder statesmen
Await
Deep in the woods
Where you say you came from
