You're not gonna like this
The way it comes across the eye
I'm not gonna fight you 
I'm just gonna open your mind 
You'll catch your death out there
If you don't come inside
There's no need
To run and hide

None the wiser
Only real eyes realize
What the lies are
Realize from the start 
What the lies are

I'm torn up inside from the sight of it
Young man, I'm a messenger
Yeah, a message that burns so slow
But, oh what a breathtaking scene
I'm not gonna fight you for it
I'm not gonna fight you
There's no need
To run and hide

I seldom dream of you
A dream of you would shroud my perfect view

I see clearly now
Shine so vibrantly
And stretch across the sky
As man,
We're just 
Pacing back and forth
And walk between 
The memories that hang
Across the earth

I see clearly now
