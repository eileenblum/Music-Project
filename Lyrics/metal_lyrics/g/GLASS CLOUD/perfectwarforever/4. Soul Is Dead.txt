My soul is gone and I've got nothing left
My mind's in the open arms of death to the lion
Tonight, I'm an apparition
Filthy kid
Bleeding on my skin again
I don't need your problems
I've got mine
I've got my own

I fucking hate the person I've become
Just like you
One breath from the soulless scum
I fucking hate the person I've become
Just like you
One breath and I've got nothing left

My mind's in the open arms of death to the lion
Tonight, I'm an apparition

How can I feel alright?
You've lost your fucking mind
How can I feel alright?
You've lost your fucking mind

It's perfect war
It's perfect war

If the axe keeps falling down
Don't let it catch your neck
Take hold of it now
And swing it the fuck back

I fucking hate the person I've become
Just like you
One breath from the soulless scum
I fucking hate the person I've become
Just like you

Nothing left
My soul is gone and I've got nothing left
My soul is gone and I've got nothing left
My soul is gone and I've got nothing left
Nothing left
