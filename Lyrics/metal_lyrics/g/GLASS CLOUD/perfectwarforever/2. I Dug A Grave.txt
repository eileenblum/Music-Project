I dug a grave
I dug a grave for you
You and me, right off that ledge there
Your open eyes can make
A great mistake
Forget escape (forget escape)

I dug a grave for you (you)
You and me
I'd rather give up and jump off the edge tonight
To end my life
Like a dead, burned rose at the cemetary gate

Just give up in the end
Give up your problems
They haunt you
Dig into the raw nerve
It bites below the skin
Just give up in the end
Just give up in the end
Give up your problems
They drain your mind
It never mattered

I dug a grave for you (you)
You and me
I'd rather give up and jump off the edge tonight
To end my life
Like a dead, burned rose at the cemetary gate

Just give up in the end
Breathe whenever you can
And bite your tongue
If it ever mattered
You bite below the skin

Just give up in the end
Bleeding out of your hands
Your savior's gone
He was never with you

No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what you think
No matter who you love
I'm gonna bury you

My inner self is bleeding out

I dug a grave
I dug a grave for you
You and me, right off that ledge there
Your open eyes can make
A great mistake
Forget escape (forget escape)
I dug a gravae for you (you)
You and me
Right off that ledge there
Your open eyes can make
A great mistake
Forget escape (forget escape)

No matter what you say
No matter what you do
No matter what you think
No matter who you love
I'm gonna bury you

(You say)
No matter what you do (what you do)
No matter what you think (what you think)
No matter who you love
You're fucking dead to me
