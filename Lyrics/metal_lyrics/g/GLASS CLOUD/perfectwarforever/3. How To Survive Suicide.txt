Bright, heavy like-minds
Cutting like knives
Bright, heavy like-minds
Pulling all sides
Bright, heavy like-minds
Cutting like knives
Bright, heavy like-minds
Pulling all sides

Take away the selfish pleasure
This is better
Draw yourself a brighter picture
Live forever
With light
With light, with heat

I should ask you
Something that I've been needing
Desperately to know

Take away the selfish pleasure
Draw yourself a brighter picture
Take away the selfish pleasure
Draw yourself a brighter picture

There's a draft and a hanging shadow
Coming in underneath the door
I am lost in an aimless army
I am leaving a perfect war

As impossible as it seems to even breathe
I am living to show you light and help you find your way
We're colossal with thicker skin and built to flee
And I'll always prefer a life that sails on calmer seas

There's a draft and a hanging shadow
Coming in underneath the door
I am lost in an aimless army
I am leaving a perfect war

And I'll always prefer a life that sails on calmer seas

Bright, heavy like-minds
Cutting like knives
Bright, heavy like-minds
Pulling all sides

Take away the selfish pleasure
This is better
Draw yourself a brighter picture
Live forever
With light
With light, with heat

I should ask you
Something that I've been needing (needing)
Desperately to know
I should ask you
Something that I've been needing

Cutting like knives
