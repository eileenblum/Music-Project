Maybe I've been breathing in too long
Ever since the last time I checked anyway
Burning at both ends just to feel OK
Maybe I've been breathing in too long
Ever since the last time I checked anyway

Something's pulling me
Maybe I'm seeing things, free and clearly
Or maybe I'm just fucking dead
This feeling takes me over
Endlessly in hopeless need
Maybe I'm just seeing things
Maybe I just feel like I've been
Breathing in too long
Ever since the last time I checked anyway
Burning at both ends just to feel OK
Maybe I've been breathing in too long
Ever since the last time I checked anyway

You never wait for me when you go
You've already gone
At least I know, you keep me in the sun
Away from breeding hate and dying slow
If I can't have you
You can leave me in the afterglow

These things
They always end the same
Way out of line
These things, they always end the same
Nobody gets out alive
These things, they always end the same
Way out of line
These things, they always end the same
Nobody gets out alive

They want you to be something
You will never be

Find your place
Turn your back and run

These things
They always end the same
Way out of line
These things, they always end the same
Nobody gets out alive
These things
They always end the same
Way out of line
These things, they always end the same
Nobody gets out alive
They always end the same
Way out of line
These things, they always end the same
Nobody gets out alive
