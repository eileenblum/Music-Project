Bleeding a perfect war
Into deep peace
Graciously free
Overflowing
What did you say?
Push the love away?
What I feel is there forever
I thought you would know me better
There's no words
There's no feelings
Horribly trapped
Stuck like a rat
What did you say?
Push the love away?
What I feel is there forever
You've been breeding a perfect war
Breeding a perfect war
Breeding a perfect war

Hide your face
I never understood your modern taste
I fucking hate the person I've become
Just like you
One breath
And I've got nothing left for you
Breeding a perfect war
With blood
With lust
Breeding a perfect war
Breeding a perfect war
With blood
With lust
Breeding a perfect war

Into deep peace
Graciously free
Overflowing
What did you say?
Push the love away?
What I feel is there forever
I thought you would know me better
There's no words
There's no feeling
Horribly trapped
Stuck like a rat

What did you say?
Push the love away?
What I feel is there forever
And you've been breeding a perfect war
Breeding a perfect war
Into deep peace
Graciously free
Overflowing
What did you say?
Push the love away?
What I feel is there forever
You've been breeding a perfect war
Breeding perfect war
With blood
With lust
Breeding a perfect war
Breeding perfect war
Bleed perfect war
War!
