Let it rain.
Walk in slow with arms outstretched,
We are the brothers,
In my brothers I trust,
I know that the devil watches over us,
Walk in slow with arms outstretched,
Breathe in deep, hold your breath.
Let it rain on me.
Let it rain.
Let it rain on me.
Let it rain on me.
Let it rain on me.

Let it rain on me.
Let it rain on me.
Let it rain on me.
