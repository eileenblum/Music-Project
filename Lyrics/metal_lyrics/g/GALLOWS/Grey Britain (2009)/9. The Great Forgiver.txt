When I died I walked into the light 
but what I saw I didn't like. 
Well I went to heaven but I didn't go in
they don't condemn the sinners.
They condemn the sin.
Heaven is full of fucking scum,
If they live like pigs they will die like one.
There will never be enough forgiveness.

Saint Peter, I must confess,
I'm more of a Devil than my life suggests.
Tell god it's appreciated, but I was born in Hell,
Hell is where we made it.

And if god is the great forgiver, 
then all the scum will be delivered.
They bury the men, but not their sins,
They just say a prayer and take them with them.
Heaven is full of fucking scum,
If they live like pigs they will die like one.
There will never be enough forgiveness.

Saint Peter, I must confess,
I'm more of a Devil than my life suggests.
Tell god it's appreciated, but I was born in Hell,
Hell is where we made it.

Saint Peter, I must confess,
I'm more of a Devil than my life suggests.
Tell god it's appreciated, but I was born in Hell,
Hell is where we made it.
