Forget yourselves, 
you're all going to burn in hell.
You have no redeeming features. 
Cold blooded. Love leeches.

If your hands could talk, 
they'd choke themselves to death before they were caught.
They have seen the horror.

I don't drink the wine, 
and I can't stomach the lies.
A million 'Hail Marry's won't save you now, 
We're burning all your churches down.
