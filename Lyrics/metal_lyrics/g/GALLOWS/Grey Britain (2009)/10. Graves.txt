[Featuring Simon Neil]Black cross burns, 
above our graves.
[x4]

Blood hands rest, 
above our graves.
[x4]

Lie with baited breath, 
I will not wait for death. 
We all share the same fate, 
in our graves.

Calling all you helpless souls,
throw down your swords and tools,
and strike a conversation about my blood hands,
there are no words to say, "I just killed a man".

The black cross burns above our graves.
