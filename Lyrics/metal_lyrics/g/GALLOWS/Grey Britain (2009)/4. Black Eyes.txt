I keep a fresh razorblade in the sole of my shoe,
it helps me when I get stuck thinking of you.
{With my} hands and knees, head on the floor.
Doubled up, {feeling} so sore.

Everything is falling apart, 
I stopped living when I drained my heart.
Cracked ribs, split lips, 
I know where you live.
Everything is turning black.
They ate my bones so you can't go back.
Clawed feet, black beaks. 
I know where you live.

Drink the poison. Trace the veins,
your saviours will not be saved.
You've got the Devils mouth and it's full of lies.
Black eyes.

Drink the poison. Trace the veins,
your saviours will not be saved.
You've got the Devils mouth and it's fucking full of lies.
Black eyes.

Black eyes.
Black eyes.
Black eyes.
