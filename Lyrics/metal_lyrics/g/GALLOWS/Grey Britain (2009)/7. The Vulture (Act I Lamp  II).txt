[Act I]

When you work for the father 
of sinners never saved,
you carry the net, 
and he holds the spade.
You will drag the lakes, 
he will rob the graves.
You will be remembered, 
no one will speak your name.

Cursed are the places you have been,
you lead us there and forced us in.
Take the girls, 
to become the daughters,
and if the horses won't drink, 
drown them in the water.

Live by the sword, 
die for the lord,
Call down the vulture 
to dine on the corpse.
