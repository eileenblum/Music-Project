Drag your crosses through the ground,
throw the carcass to the hounds.
The ship we wrecked is going down.
The river is a bitch and tonight she howls.
Remember me as you pass by,
as you are now, so once was I.
As I am now, so you will be,
prepare for death, follow me.

Four nails, four corners,
four riders and four horses.
Bring me famine, bring me death,
bring me war and pestilence.
Throw your fists into the ground,
beat by beat as the blows rain down.
This is a cold grey world we made for ourselves.
The bed we made is a grave in Hell.

Remember me as you pass by,
as you are now, so once was I.
As I am now, so you will be,
prepare for death, follow me.
The sky tears open and it pours with blood,
the moon turns red and the streets will flood.
Dig out your casket and fill it with stone.
This is the end of the world,
and we are bringing it home.

Four nails, four corners,
four riders and four horses.
Bring me famine, bring me death,
bring me war and pestilence.
Throw your fists into the ground,
beat by beat as the blows rain down.
This is a cold grey world we made for ourselves.
The bed we made is a grave in Hell.

So kill yourself 
'cause there ain't nothing else. 
Go on and fucking kill yourself.

Four nails, four corners,
four riders and four horses.
Four tales, death voices. 
No love, all corpses.
Throw your fists into the ground,
beat by beat as the blows rain down.
This is a cold grey world we made for ourselves.
The bed we made is a grave in Hell.

So kill yourself 
'cause there ain't nothing else. 
Go on and fucking kill yourself.
