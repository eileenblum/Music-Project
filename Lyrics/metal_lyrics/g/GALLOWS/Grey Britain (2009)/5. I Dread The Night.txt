I'm going out tonight.
Got an ache in my guts and my stomach's alight.
So crack your fucking knuckles and straighten my spine.
We are the night.

I'm going out tonight.
Got a burning in my blood that just ain't right.
So I'll tear my fucking muscles while I watch the time.
We are the night.

I'm lying with my back to the floor, 
I ain't ever been in so much pain before.
If I said I wasn't scared I'd be a fucking liar,
my body's burning like it's on fire.

Sweating like I ain't before,
first it was a cold, now it's a fever for sure.
Forget singing, I can barely speak.
I think I'm fucking dying, I can't breathe.

And I wanna be, anyone in the world but me.
Trapped in the body of a man defeated,
I am the shame of mistakes repeated.

And I wanna be, anyone in the world but me.
Trapped in the body of a man defeated,
I am the shame of fucking mistakes repeated.

I'm going out tonight.
Got an ache in my guts and my stomach's alight.
So crack your fucking knuckles and straighten my spine.
We are the night.

I'm going out tonight.
Got a burning in my blood that just ain't right.
So I'll tear my fucking muscles while I watch the time.
We are the night.
We are the night.

There will be no more grey.
We have finished digging the grave.
We are the new black, 
and we're as serious as a heart attack.

We are the night.
We are the night.

We are the night.
We are the night.
We are the new black, 
we're as serious as a heart attack.

And I wanna be, anyone in the world but me.
Trapped in the body of a man defeated,
I am the shame of mistakes repeated.

And I wanna be, anyone in the world but me.
Trapped in the body of a man defeated,
I am the shame of fucking mistakes repeated.

And I wanna be, and I wanna be
Trapped in the body of a man defeated,
I am the shame of mistakes repeated.

And I wanna be, anyone in the world but me.
Trapped in the body of a man defeated,
I am the shame of mistakes repeated.
