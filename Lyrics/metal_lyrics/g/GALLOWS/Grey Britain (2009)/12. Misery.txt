FUCK!
Misery fucking loves me, 
and I love her so.
She is the cold embrace of no escape, 
when I'm left alone.
Misery fucking loves me, 
and I love her too.
She is the dying breath of nothing left, 
that I've become accustomed to.

There is nothing left for me, 
I want to kill myself just for relief.
Black cloud, death shroud.
The weight of the world dragging me down.
I have nothing to offer anyone,
the hopes of the hopeless coming undone,
misery is my only friend,
she is a cold fucking snap, 
but she is not the end.

Misery fucking loves me, 
but I love her more.
She is the last light, the dark nights,
noose around my neck, the hole in the floor.
There is nothing left for me, 
I want to kill myself just for relief.
Black cloud, death shroud.
The weight of the world dragging me down.
I have nothing to offer anyone,
the hopes of the hopeless coming undone,
misery is my only friend,
she is a cold fucking snap, 
but she is not the end.

MISERY!
Misery fucking loves us, 
AND WE LOVE HER TOO.
Misery fucking loves us, 
AND WE LOVE HER TOO.
Misery fucking loves us, 
AND WE LOVE HER TOO.
Misery fucking loves us, 
AND WE LOVE HER TOO.
