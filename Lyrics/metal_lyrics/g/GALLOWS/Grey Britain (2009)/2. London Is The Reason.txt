We are the rats and we run this town.
We are the black plague bearing down.
We have no fear, and we have no pity.
We hate you, we hate this city.

Every mistake you ever made,
the bodies you thought would never need graves.
They pave the gutters of London town,
until the streets become a feeding ground.

London is the reason.
London is the reason.
London is the reason.

We are the rats and we run this town.
We are the black plague bearing down.
We have no fear, we have no pity.
We hate you, we hate this city.

The River Thames is running dry.
The bodies have been piled high,
all the corpses washed up on the shores,
we'll drag them out because they are yours.

London is the reason.
London is the reason.
London is the reason.

We are the rats and we run this town.
We are the black plague bearing down.
We have no fear, we have no pity.
We hate you, we hate this city.

London is the reason,
when it burns down we'll be tried for treason.
London is the reason,
when it burns down we'll be tried for treason.
London is the reason,
when it burns down we'll be tried for treason.
London is the reason,
when it burns down we'll be tried for treason.
Yeah!
