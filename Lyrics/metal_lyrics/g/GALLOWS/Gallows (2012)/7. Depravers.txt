Those nights stretched out forever, followed by nervous days.
Live in suicide weather you become that old clichÃ©.
It came without warning at a time I couldn't see.
I lashed out in all directions, some dark current pushing me.

At an early age, I made up my mind, that I'd live my life truly free.
Condemned everything, but where does it lead?
Sometimes there's no third dimension, everything's just as it seems.

I'm fighting for my future, I'm fighting with my past.
If I keep living in my head, there's no way I'm gonna last.

At an early age, I made up my mind, that I'd live my life truly free.
Condemned everything, but where does it lead?
Sometimes there's no third dimension, everything's just as it seems.

Need it all, need it now.
Total darkness, don't care how.
Need to ride, need to skate.
I've hated love, I've loved to hate.
Sniffed lightning bolts of east end coke.
Need a cigarette though I don't smoke.
Gimme every last thing you can, I wanna black out man.

At an early age, I made up my mind, that I'd live my life truly free.
Condemned everything, but where does it lead?
Sometimes there's no third dimension, everything's just as it seems.

I lashed out in all directions, some dark current pushing me.
I lashed out in all directions, some dark current pushing, pushing me.
