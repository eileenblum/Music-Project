I couldn't blur it all out if I had a thousand years.
I'd need a hundred more to make it disappear.
If I had to do it all over again, there's no way I would.
Everyone would go missing.

End me in the Black Sea, scatter my ashes in the East.
End me in the Black Sea, Odessa, oh Odessa.
End me in the Black Sea, scatter my ashes in the East.
End me in the Black Sea, Odessa, oh Odessa.

You can stare at a car crash, but it'll stare right back.
The violent labours of love in the back of a Cadillac.
You wanna know your fortune, no matter what the cost.
You're at the bottom of the world.

End me in the Black Sea, scatter my ashes in the East.
End me in the Black Sea, Odessa, oh Odessa.
End me in the Black Sea, scatter my ashes in the East.
End me in the Black Sea, Odessa, oh Odessa.

I'm a tourist.
I'm a wreck.
I'm a vomit-green transparency lighting up a cigarette.
I'm a sycophant.
I'm a small time crook.
I'm a hail of bullets.
I'm a name crossed out in your history book.

End me in the Black Sea, scatter my ashes in the East.
End me in the Black Sea, Odessa, oh Odessa.
End me in the Black Sea, scatter my ashes in the East.
End me in the Black Sea, Odessa, oh Odessa.
