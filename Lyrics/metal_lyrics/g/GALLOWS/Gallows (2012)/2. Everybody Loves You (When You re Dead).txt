Everybody loves you, when you're fucking dead.
Could be a needle in the arm or a bullet in the head.
But some things are certain.
When it's your time to go, your sins will be forgiven by everyone you know.
But some things are certain.
When it's your time to go, all your lies and secrets get buried in the snow.

Everybody loves you, when you're fucking dead.
Hashish eaters, Buddhists and men of war bleed radioactive red.
But some things are certain.
When it's your time to go, nothing really matters when you're six feet down below.
But some things are certain.
When it's your time to go, there's no one left in heaven and hell is just a hoax.
