Do you think they're out to get you?
Do you often become ill?
Are your nerves in poor condition?
Are you living off of pills?

Do you suffer nervous breakdowns?
Are you frightened for your life?
Are you often plagued by nightmares?
Can you sleep through the night?

Have you told lies about the process?
Are you convinced they're inside your head?
Are you feeling persecuted?
Are you afraid you'll end up dead?

Do you feel you're being laughed at?
Do you feel so paranoid
That you'd see our symbols shattered?
You would have them all destroyed.

In us, we trust!
In us, we trust!
In us, we trust!
In us, we trust!

There's no way out.
There's no escape
From the vicious circle
We embrace.

There's no way out.
There's no escape
From the vicious circle
We embrace.

Karma's gonna smash your head in
Like a ton of bricks.
Purity hides behind a death mask and
Victim Culture's on the rise.

You showed me the tenderness of a funeral
Just another girl without a room.

Victim Culture's on the rise.
In us, we trust.
In us, we trust.
In us, we trust.
In us, we trust.

There's no way out.
There's no escape
From the vicious circle
We embrace.

There's no way out.
There's no escape
From the vicious circle
We embrace.

Proud hearts, sick minds.
Victim Culture's on the rise.
Bad blood, worse vibes.
Victim culture's on the rise.

You better fear the future.
You better fear what's coming next.
You better fear the future.
Grave diggers keep busy while we obsess.

In us, we trust.
In us, we trust.
In us, we trust.
In us, we trust.

There's no way out.
There's no escape
From the vicious circle
We embrace.

There's no way out.
There's no escape
From the vicious circle
We embrace.
