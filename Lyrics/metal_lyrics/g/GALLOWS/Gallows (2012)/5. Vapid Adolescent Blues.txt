We sat down by the river that cuts the city in two
Film stars for security cameras
Vapid Adolescent Blues
You told me your secrets, I didn't tell you mine
You may be beautiful
But, there's swastikas spinning in your eyes
I'd rather be anywhere but here

I see smoke in the distance
Weighs on me like a hex
Spread yourself with your fingers
Let me pay my respects
Hold my head in place
And I'll hide my face
And you'll feel my mouth in your most sacred place

I'd rather be anywhere
I'd rather be anywhere but
Nowhere, I'd rather be
Nowhere, I'd rather be
Nowhere, I'd rather be
Nowhere, I'd rather be

The bottle, the minutes, the seconds, the daughters, the payphones, the
Lies, the boredom, the slaughter
The world would collapse
The world would collapse
Arch your back
Just arch your back
I'd rather be anywhere but here

I followed my own compass
Didn't care where it leads
Dirty rivers of central London, the Ganges burning steam
In this moment time means nothing but the pulse beating in my wrist
Half drunk in far away places where days of the week are just words on a
List

I'd rather be anywhere
I'd rather be anywhere but
Nowhere, I'd rather be
Nowhere, I'd rather be
Nowhere, I'd rather be
Nowhere, I'd rather be

There's blood on the wind
(There's blood on the wind)
There's blood on the tracks
(There's blood on the tracks)
There's blood on my hands
(There's blood on my hands)
I can't take it back
(I can't take it back)

Nowhere, I'd rather be
