The years I was numb feel no regrets
But there's hard to come cast out like a man
I surrounded myself with outsider art
It murdered my spirit and life fell apart
Alone in the garden I love by the sea
With none of the sense why chill over me
The feel last forever I think you can keep
My days were together and now it's last a week
Time is a bastard, the routine a hore
The sun is exploding what headache for war
With... sleeping the moon holds her knife
Her such one to seven will stand in my life
But in that brief moment our life's be collide
Freedom from cast with you by my side
No need for section who hold holy books
My notice is coming I see how it looks

Ohh, our lives they collide
Ohh, our lives they collide
Ohh, our lives they collide
Ohh, our lives they collide

Born of the... how alive
Born... the state back
Get out of life

Nothing last forever I think you can keep
My days were together my nuts last a week
Time is bastard, routine a hore
The sun is exploding what headache for war

Ohh, our lives they collide
Ohh, our lives they collide
Ohh, our lives they collide
Ohh, our lives they collide

Our lives they collide
My life they collide, they collide, they collide
