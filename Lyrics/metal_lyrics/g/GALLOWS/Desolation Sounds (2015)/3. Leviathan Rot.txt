Let this circle represent the other sun. 
Eclipse the light that surrounds us.
Fall through shadow across the sky.
Practice eternity until dawn arrives. 
In the shadow of the cataract city. 
Fucking up the atmosphere. Their knives below the water.
Just like I'd always feared. Lost in her snowy complexion.
Numb to her artless touch. Searching for a little hell. 
Up in her guts. Life's as cheap as you want to make it. 
In the cloak our hands created. 
Life's as cheap as you want to make it. 
In the cloak our hands created. 
Let leviathan rot. Eclipse the light surrounding me. 
The stations of the upside down cross. 
Life's beauty is its decay. Let leviathan rot.
