I arranged it all in my head. I'd write silences from here on out. 
One last trip across the expanse. It would come to an end. 
Spells still assembled in my mind. They were different now. 
The alchemy was in the words.
The routine of chaos had diminished and died.
Gold for bondage. 

They'll be no swan song just a light to guide you through the snow.
They'll be no swan song just a night when you're truly lost 

I had already sang the night. The magick of it all had left me. 
I was lost in myself. I crawled out of its dripping jaws too many times.
Gold for bondage. 

They'll be no swan song just a light to guide you through the snow.
They'll be no swan song just a night when you're truly lost. 
The night came where I was lost. And no longer knew who I was.
