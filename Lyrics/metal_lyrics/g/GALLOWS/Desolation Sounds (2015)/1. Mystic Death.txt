You need to be afraid. As life's luxe dulls everyone leaves. 
We'll have found our place. Gone together under the waves. 
She will be my name. You mean nothing to me. 
She will be my llame. You mean nothing. 
Even bad dreams are too good, they're too good. 
Even bad dreams are too good, too good for you. 
Even bad dreams are too good, they're too good. 
Even bad dreams are too good, too good for you. 
You need to be afraid. Desolation will be your godhead. 
fve been promised heaven before. All the colours in the darkness.
Crawl back inside her. With love that's shattered. 
Crawl back inside her. With love that's cold. 
Even bad dreams are too good, they're too good. 

Even bad dreams are too good, too good for you.
Even bad dreams are too good, they're too good.
Even bad dreams are too good, too good for you. 

Cut the chord. Walk into the sky. 
Like a world I've never known. It's all there when l close my eyes.
And what's left mirrors what went before.

And what's left mirrors what went before.
And what's left mirrors what went before.
And what's left mirrors what went before.

Mystic Death comes for us all. Mystic Death, Mystic Death comes for us all. 
Even bad dreams are too good, they're too good. 
Even bad dreams are too good, too good for you. 
Even bad dreams are too good, they're too good. 
Even bad dreams are too good, too good for you.
