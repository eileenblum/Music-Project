North thaws, South disappears, East vanishes, West fades.
Cut the love out of my days. You'd see me in chains. 
North thaws, South disappears, East vanishes, West fades.
Draw down the moon and walk away. You'd see me in chains.

l don't need another violent summer.
l don't need another violent summer.
l don't need another violent summer.
l don't need another violent summer.

Of sham youth, sham art, sham revolution, sham hearts, sham love, sham death, 
sham lives, sham sex, sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll.

North thaws, South disappears, East vanishes, West fades. 
Draw down the moon and walk away. 
You'd see me in chains.

ln chains, you'd see me in chains. 
ln chains, you'd see me in chains. 

l don't need another violent summer of sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll. 
l don't need another violent summer of sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll. 
l don't need another violent summer of sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll. 
l don't need another violent summer of sham rock and roll, sham rock and roll.
