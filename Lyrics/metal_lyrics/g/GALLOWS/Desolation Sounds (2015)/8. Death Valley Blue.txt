We are both prisoners. We want, we want, we want, we want. 
To make our escape. We are both refugees. 
We hope, we hope, we hope, we hope. To someday find our place. 
Let it go and disappear. If they don't return baby I'll he here. 
In the end I'd die for you. I'm born again death valley blue. 
Let it go and disappear. If they don't return baby I'll be here. 
In the end I'd die for you. I'm born again death valley blue. 
We are both atheists. We pray, we pray, we pray, we pray. 
We'll never feel his grace. We are both nihilists. 
Our world, our world, our world, our world. Is void and space. 
Let it go and disappear. If they don't return baby I'll be here. 
In the end I'd die for you. I'm born again death valley blue. 
Let it go and disappear. If they don't return baby I'll be here. 
In the end I'd die for you. I'm born again death valley blue.
Let it go and disappear. If they don't return baby I'll be here. 
In the end I'd die for you. I'm born again death valley blue.
Let it go and disappear. If they don't return baby I'll be here. 
In the end I'd die for you. I'm born again.
