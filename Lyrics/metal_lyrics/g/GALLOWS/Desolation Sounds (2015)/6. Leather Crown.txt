Prayer wheels keep spinning and pagan blood returns. 
Haunted by visions of crawling death the invisible worm. 
With a look so gone and a mask so spectral. 
We both know what's behind the green door of a life that's spent so reckless.
Goddamn the day I was born. 
I've been patient for too long. 
Goddamn it all, Goddamn it all. 
Goddamn the day l was born. 
I've been patient for too long now. 
Dreams of the pentagram while I'm inside her. 
Leather crown upon her head unforgettable and frightening. 
A symbol of well being drawn on to her skin. 
Held my spirit in her hands. I should have seen the omen. 
Goddamn the day l was born. I've been patient for too long.
Goddamn it all, Goddamn it all. Goddamn the day I was born. 
I've been patient for too long now. The widening circles of her desire seeking out new flesh.
Cut off from her nirvana a vision of regret.
Only sinking deeper into waters of lust.
Sold into captivity with no one left to trust.
Goddamn the day l was born. 
I've been patient for too long. 
Goddamn it all, Goddamn it all. Goddamn the day I was born.
Goddamn it all, Goddamn it all.
