At the edge of the water. At the foot of the hills. 
Fogs claws at the mountain. And the passing ships. 
If desolation were a sound, I've heard it 
Trample the tall grass. Let distance darken my skin. 
Swim in grey oceans. That end where they begin. 
If desolation were a sound, I've heard it 
There's hope in desolation. It's a familiar sound. 
There's hope in desolation. Black boots on the pavement. 
Under the midnight sun. Older than imagination. 
Savage as can be. If desolation were a sound, I've heard it.
There's hope in desolation. It's a familiar sound. 
There's hope in desolation. 
There's mercy after all. There's mercy after all. 
There's hope in desolation. It's a familiar sound. 
There's hope in desolation. It's a familiar sound. 
There's hope in desolation. It's a familiar sound. 
There's hope in desolation.
