I strike the bell. I light the flame. There is no grace. 
There is no guilt. This is the law. Do what thou wilt. 
Love is the law, love is the law. Love under will and that's all. 
Love is the law, love is the law. Love under will and that's all.

Behold this bleeding breast of mine. Gashed will the sacramental sign.
I strike the bell. I light the flame. There is no grace. There is no guilt.
This is the law. Do what thou wilt. Love is the law, love is the law.
Love under will and that's all. Love is the law, love is the law. 
Love under will and that's all. Bring me though midnight to the sun.
Love is the law, love is the law. Love under will and that's all. 
Love is the law, love is the law. Love under will and that's all.
