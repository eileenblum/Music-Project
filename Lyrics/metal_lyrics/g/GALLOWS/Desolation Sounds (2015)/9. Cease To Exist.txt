You are the forest I'm lost in the trees. 
The cold ground trembles beneath our feet. 
The world's wide void in the curve of her breast. 
Endless beaches through the tears on her dress. 

If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop killing me. 

The low sun hides the last house on the lane. 
Gathering darkness like there's no other way. 
I'll make you a mother light up the abyss. 
In dreaming meadows I cease to exist. 

If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop killing me. 
If I told you this was killing me would you stop. 
If I told you this was killing me.
