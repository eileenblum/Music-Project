Black knuckles and broken teeth
Grey days and grey streets
Same faces that same release
If this town had a name it would be defeat
So sick of waking up to white skies
Can't stand the look in everybody's eyes
They want to kick my fucking head in just to feel alive

So you wanna go?
I wanna go
So you wanna go?
Let's go

Black knuckles and broken teeth
I've got more fillings than a butchers got beef

So you wanna go?
I wanna go
So you wanna go?
Let's go

We're not the same ones
We're not the same ones you and me (no you and me we're not the same)
[x2]
If we were the same ones
I'd draw this knife across my throat and bleed it dry
[x2]

Black knuckles and broken teeth
I know your face from that early last week
About eleven I was walking home
You had a fucking army I was on my own
So sick of trouble from these hearts
Can't take the beatings in the fucking dark
Too bad this mongrel's got a bite worse than his bark

So you wanna go?
I wanna go
So you wanna go?
Let's go

Black knuckles and broken teeth
I've got more fillings than a butchers got beef

So you wanna go?
I wanna go
I wanna go
Let's go

We're not the same ones
We're not the same ones you and me (no you and me we're not the same)
[x2]
If we were the same ones
I'd draw this knife across my throat and bleed it dry
[x2]

We're not the same ones
We're not the same
We're not the same ones
We're not the same
You and me, you and me
We're not the same ones
We're not the same
You and me, you and me
