Mayday Mayday
The captain's lost control again
The fucking ship is breaking up
We're going down in flames

Mayday Mayday
Man overboard again
The sharks have started circling
They only eat the brave

The SS Death lost everything
No one here can fucking swim
So baby, baby hold me tight
While I drown myself in you tonight
While I drown myself in you

Mayday Mayday
The ship has hit the rocks again
This isn't going to fucking work
We're heading to our graves

Mayday Mayday
Man overboard again
We're sinking in the river Stix
No one can escape

The SS Death lost everything
No one here can fucking swim
So baby, baby hold me tight
While I drown myself in you tonight
While I drown myself in you
While I drown myself in you tonight
While I drown myself in you

Ladies and Gentlemen
May I have your attention please
This is the captain of your ship
I'm sorry we depart this way
You left me broken hearted
But I never loved you anyway
No I never loved you anyway
No I never loved you anyway
No I never loved you anyway
