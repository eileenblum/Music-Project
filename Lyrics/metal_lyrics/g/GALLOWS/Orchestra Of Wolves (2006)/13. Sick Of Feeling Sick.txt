[Re-issue Bonus Track]I know tonight.
That you ain't sleeping alone.
Youâre telling me that youâre lonely.
But you wont answer your phone.
Its because youâre on your fucking knees.
Choking him back, while youâre struggling to breathe.
I know tonight.
That you ain't sleeping alone.
Itâs fucking freezing.
In here.
So I shut my eyes
Cos Iâm so sick of fucking being sick.
I know tonight
That you ain't sleeping alone
Youâll always be my queen
Tho Iâm tied to an empty throne
And Iâm so cold I feel like I could die
Your words are so warm
Iâm being buried alive.
I know tonight.
That you ain't sleeping alone.
Itâs fucking freezing.
In here
So I shut my eyes.
You ain't going anywhere
And I ain't got no place to be
So lay down here baby
And fucking lie to me
My flesh and blood are freezing up in the frost
I wanna tell you everything that I know about love
But Iâm done.
Iâm done
So feed me to the fucking dogs
I know tonight
That you ain't sleeping alone
Youâre telling me youâre lonely
But you wonât answer your phone
Itâs because youâre on your fucking knees
Choking him back while youâre struggling to breathe
I know tonight
That you ain't sleeping alone.
You ain't going anywhere
And I ain't got no place to be
So lay down here baby
And fucking lie to me
My flesh and blood are freezing up in the frost
I wanna tell you everything that I know about loss.
But Iâm fucking done.
