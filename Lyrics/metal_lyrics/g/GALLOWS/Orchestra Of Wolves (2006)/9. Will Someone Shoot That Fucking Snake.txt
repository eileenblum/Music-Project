Something wicked this way comes
When i see it every night
You ain't a rockstar yet (you're dead)
You need some self-respect
You always were a fucking prick

Blackening her name
Screaming in her face
I'll fucking drown you in the rain
Will someone shoot that fucking snake

I've got a knife for you
To turn your heart from red to blue
The beating
I've got a knife for you
Engraved with the words fuck you
The bleeding

You're fucked you can't get rescued
The pleading
We've got a knife for you
You're fucking dead when we catch you
The screaming
