It flew in from across the sea
A great plague of misery
A swarm of lonely nights
A dark end to her lonely life

As the waves rolled in
The sky collapsed and covered everything
The clouds burst and the red rained down
To douse all the fires of this town

He walked out a selfish man
With your heart still beating in his hands
But he could never ever break it
He just broke himself

As the waves rolled in
The sky collapsed and covered everything
The clouds burst and the red rained down
To douse all the fire in this town
And the red rained down

Don't lie to my fucking face
You can't hide a life of disgrace

My mother you've got me
And you've got my brothers as well
We'll be with you till the fucking end
To carry you across this barren hell
Every word he said was false
He never showed an ounce of remorse
Left on the only road out of our lives
His hands are burning
Now we're standing in this fucking divide
Don't you ever even worry about that
Me and the boys forever by your side
He rolled in on a pale horse
Dragged away by your lonely corpse
He left with nothing
He didn't make a sound
