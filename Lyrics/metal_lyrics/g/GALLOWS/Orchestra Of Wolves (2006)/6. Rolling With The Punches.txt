I'm forever dragging my fucking feet
Despite the fact that I never sleep
And everyone in my fucking band
Is telling me that I owe them again
I'm going out of my fucking mind
Trying to find the words before I run out of time
Because I'm already losing all my friends
We send our messages when arguments end

We've been rolling with the punches and by now
Most other bands would have been knocked out
Trust me we ain't staying down
We won't rest We won't rest We won't rest 
Until this record's out

I don't even know how we got this far
Writing half the lyrics in the fucking car
We don't practice we just play shows
That's how we fucking rock and roll

We've been rolling with the punches and by now
Most other bands would have been knocked out
Trust me we ain't staying down
We won't rest We won't rest We won't rest 
Until this record's out

I am a hypocrite
I am the concrete around our feet
And even when I push us in
I'll find a way to drag us out again
