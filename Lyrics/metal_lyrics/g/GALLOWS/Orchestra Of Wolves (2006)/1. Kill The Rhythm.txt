Kill the rhythm
Smash the beat
We're gonna party till we're dead on our feet

We don't fuck about
Say what we think
Wont stop till everyone screams

For the right only
There's a reason to be moving on the floor
For one night only
Leave your inhibitions at the door
For one night only
We ain't gonna fight no more
For one night only
We bring the party like no other before
We aren't here
To fucking fight
We just wanna party till the end of the night

We start the fires
And lose control
Burning down the stage at every fucking show

For the right only
There's a reason to be moving on the floor
For one night only
Leave your inhibitions at the door
For one night only
We ain't gonna fight no more
For one night only
We bring the party like no other before

To the rhythm
To the beat
Get Down
