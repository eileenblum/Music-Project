My name is Casanova;
I'm basically a man.
I have the head of a wolf;
The appetite of an entire land.
This song is going out to the girls,
You're all looking fucking fine.
Baby spread those shaking legs,
Because I'm feeling fucking hungry tonight.

I like to feed on broken hearts;
There ain't no taste like lovers falling apart.

If I offer to buy you a drink,
Trust me when I say it's non-alcoholic.
You're no good to me if you can't even speak.
I don't want you passing out I want you sucking my dick.
If I offer to buy you a drink,
Trust me when I say it's non-alcoholic.
I want you to wake up and remember my name
When you're washing my cum off your fucking face.

My name is Casanova;
I'm basically a man.
I have the head of a wolf;
The appetite of an entire land.
This song is going out to the girls,
You're all looking well buff.
I'm sick of all this long term shit.
I just wanna fuck.

I like to feed on broken hearts;
There ain't no taste like lovers falling apart.

If I offer to buy you a drink,
Trust me when I say it's non-alcoholic.
You're no good to me if you can't even speak.
I don't want you passing out I want you sucking my dick.
If I offer to buy you a drink,
Trust me when I say it's non-alcoholic.
I want you to wake up and remember my name
When you're washing my cum off your fucking face.


My name is Casanova;
I'm nothing but a beast.
Girl, the way you're shaking those hips
Has got me ready for a fucking feast.
This song is going out to the girls;
I want to feel your body close against mine.
Why are we wasting time with conversation,
When we can fuck for the rest of the night?

The hardest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return.
