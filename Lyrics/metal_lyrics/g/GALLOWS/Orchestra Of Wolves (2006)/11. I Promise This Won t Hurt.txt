Take these teeth
All they do is fucking cause me grief
They ain't working for me I can't even think
When the lights go on
I grip this chair I don't feel so strong
Anything could happen it could all go wrong

All those wasted nights
All the times when I lost the fights
Are right before my fucking eyes in print
The figure on this fucking page
Has wiped the smile right off my face
Eight hundred pounds is a lot to pay when you're skint

Take these teeth
Just for a second I need some fucking relief
They're keeping me awake and I can't sleep
Can you drain the blood
I've swallowed so much I think I want to throw up

Can't you see that I've had enough
Can you drain the blood from my fucking mouth
