[Re-issue Bonus Track]Today my heart collapsed.
And the feeling in my stomachs like a knife in my back.
And it's too damn short for me to get a grip
and pull the fucker out before it sticks.

Today my lungs collapsed
And I'm choking on my blood which has all turned black
And everything I'm spitting out. I'm spitting out.
Just spells your name.

Why, oh why, would you use that one.
You know I never used it, cos it just ain't on.
Can you pull it out of me please
cos it really fucking hurts and Its making me dizzy
No? Well fine, then ill tell you what.
I'm gonna tell you that I love you till my breathing stops.

Today my heart collapsed
Everything was fine and now I'm ready to relapse.
I can't understand how you made it through
I'm totally fucked cos I'm falling for you..

Today my lungs collapsed
and I'm choking on my blood which has all turned black
and everything I'm spitting out
I'm spitting out.

Why would you use that one
you know I never used it cos it just ain't on.
can you pull it outta me please
cos it really fucking hurts and it's making me dizzy
No! well fine then I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna tell you that I love you till my breathing stops.

The black heart king
has met his black heart queen
forgot everything he was
for the taste of her skin
his nights no longer lonely
once he let her in
and by the orchestra of wolves
you can hear him singâ¦.
