So here I lie
In the belly of a shark
So fucking cold and so fucking dark
So here I lie
In the belly of a shark
And how the fuck did I get this far?

Now all I have to do
Is swim after you
Convince you to climb in too

Cut yourself first
They can smell your blood
From forty miles away
There'll be here in no time
There'll be here in no time

They can smell you bleeding motherfucker miles away, you

So here I lie
In the belly of a shark
So fucking cold and so fucking dark
So here I lie
In the belly of a shark
And how the fuck did I get this far?

I'm gonna show you
Exactly what you mean to me
I'm gonna eat every man that you see
