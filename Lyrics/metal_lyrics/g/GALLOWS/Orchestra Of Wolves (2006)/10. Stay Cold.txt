Watford town has gone and fucking let us down
(Fuck you!)
We don't know the cunts who fucked us at the show
(Fuck you, you fucking cunts!)
Our shit is gone and it ain't coming back
(Fuck you!)
Five good men go broke while the rats get fat
(Fuck you, you fucking cunts!)

We don't care if you're a boxer
Or if your dad's a heavyweight
We don't even fucking measure up
But we'll fight you if that's what it will take

Someone said a grand don't come for free
Apparently it does when you're a fucking thief
Back to square one
But we won't fucking come undone
(Fuck you!)
And now we're on the prowl
This pack of wolves will hunt you down
(Fuck you, you fucking cunts!)

We don't care if you're a boxer
Or if you're dads a heavyweight
We don't even fucking measure up
But we'll fight you if that's what it will take

Someone said a grand don't come for free
I heard different at the sports academy

Don't think this time that you got away
Like every dog you'll have your fucking day
Seconds out round two
We'll set the wolf pack loose on you
