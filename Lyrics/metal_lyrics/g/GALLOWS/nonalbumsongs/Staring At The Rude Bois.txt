["Orchestra Of Wolves" B-Side][feat. Lethal Bizzle]
[originally by The Ruts]It's a small minded world in the middle of a crowd
The room is fucking dark and the musics loud
Sleeves cut through and they don't say goodbye
But there's no room to run cause the floor is packed tight

A voice shouts loud, "Never Surrender"
A voice in the crowd, "Never Surrender"
A howl in the crowd getting louder and louder
"Never Surrender", "We'll Never Surrender"

Girls in their short skirts are running at the bar
While they're nodding along to Jamie D's bass guitar
It's so fucking hot the walls are dripping sweat
The boys in the corner are fucked off their heads

Staring at the rude bois [x2]
Dancing with the rude bois [x2]
Staring at the rude bois [x2]

Some boys roll in with their hats pulled down
They ain't from around here, they're not from my town
The lights flicker when the girls start screaming
Hats covered in blood and the boys not breathing

A voice shouts loud, "Never Surrender"
A voice in the crowd, "Never Surrender"
A howl in the crowd getting louder and louder
"Never Surrender", "We'll Never Surrender"

[Bizzle]
Yeah; The Bizzle
Same shit different day but they call them urban soldiers
Lil kids with big revolvers repping post codes on their shoulders
You with no respect for olders, money, guns, range rovers
By then when your game is over mommy crying on the sofa
And that's the way it is, I'm not saying that it's right
But these streets are so fucked you gotta stick with a shank tonight
Pray tomorrow will be alright, try and avoid another fight
But if it's all fuck it

I'll never surrender

Staring at the rude bois [x2]
Dancing with the rude bois [x2]
Staring at the rude bois [x2]

Staring at the rude bois [x2]
Dancing with the rude bois [x2]
Staring at the rude bois [x2]
