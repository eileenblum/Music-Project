I went the wrong way down the right track
The path I walked down took me back
To my beginnings, to the fucking start 
And I what I saw there nearly broke my heart.

I guess with friends like these, who the fuck needs enemies?

Spent a hundred grand in only 12 months 
And man I feel like a fucking cunt.
This man has got money; 
If my blood was gold would you let me bleed?

I guess with friends like these, who the fuck needs enemies?

Last year I sold my self short,
Balance read nothing but noughts.
This year I'm a fuckin' new man, 
Got a savings account and a five year fuckin' plan
