Voices of desolation  
from gods of despair 
upon the bridge of vastness being enthroned  
and worshiped in Flames 

Tighten down by the arms  
convicted to an end 
rotten sculptures of the undead  
sucking souls to Rise again 

Legions of this narrow-minded world  
face your creator! 

Burning in flesh,  
rotting in blame,  
letting your spirit free against al odds 

Those who stand against my kingdom  
walk forth or Burn in Hell,  
my vengeance has crushed upon the earth 

Those who stand against my will  
my vengeance will crush upon you  
punishing the untamed and reversing your fate 

Here I wait upon my throne  
seeking for the ceaseless Fire,  
Fire!â
