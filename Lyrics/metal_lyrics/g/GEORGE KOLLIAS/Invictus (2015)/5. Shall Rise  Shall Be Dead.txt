Come forth, bow to me as I Rise,  
as clouds rain my blood 
I Rise upon the masses, I am the chosen one 
my kingdom Rises on mortals, across seas and skies 

Desolate thoughts of wisdom  
beneath a glass reality 

Behold, the endless taste of rapture  
who calls you to eternity,  
I Raise my fist to unbelievers,  
I am the faceless one born to Divine 

Those who will Rise, are those who shall Die,  
thy kingdom falls from grace as their gods are Burning 

Here and beyond  
you shall be my slaves,  
I am the holy one,  
I am the bringer of life 

Come forth, bow to me as I Rise,  
I am chosen one, I welter in lust 
I Rise upon the masses, bow to the holy one 
my kingdom Rises on mortals, across seas and skies 

Desolate thoughts of wisdom  
beneath this Empty world 
Those who will Rise, are those who shall Die,  
thy kingdom falls from grace as their gods are Burning
