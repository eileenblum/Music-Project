Through Empty Eyes Of Light, I observe 
where the mind reflects good and evil  
as fast as thoughts contrasts the living  
straight from the depths and beyond the skies 

ââ¦ beyond the skies 

Through Empty words Of wisdom and insanity  
I speak in wrath beyond the shadows,  
I draw the line of ignorance and wisdom  
words to be heard, truth to be hated 

ââ¦ truth to be hated, words to be heard 
straight from the depths and beyond the skies 

Trapped beyond the truth, fulfilled in sorrow 
locked beyond the gates, Through Empty Eyes Of Light 

Through Empty thoughts Of lies I Burn  
with chants of demons Echoing within me  
in search we Burn, in fear we Rise 
within the Eyes, beyond the Light 

ââ¦ Through Empty Eyes!â
