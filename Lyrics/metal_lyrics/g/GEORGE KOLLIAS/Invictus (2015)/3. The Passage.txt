This was The Passage of life,  
surrounded by roses and thorns;  
this was The Passage to Light  
with crosses as symbols of craftiness 

Mourning chants of ghouls, straight from the dark side  
I hear the Voice of darkness calling my name 

Whispering in the ears of the Dead, to break the spell of tomb  
I Rise within the living and sing my saviour's pray 

This was The Passage of life,  
surrounded by roses and thorns;  
this was The Passage to Light  
with crosses as symbols of life 

Daylight bows to darkness beyond the depths of sky,  
The Passage failed to show me the way to Divine 

Sour taste sheets of blasphemy covering my soul,  
I'm standing here all wondering âwhat takes to be rebornââ
