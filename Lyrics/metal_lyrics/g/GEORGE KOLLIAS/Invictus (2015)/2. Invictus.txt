I pray for holiness  
beyond this place of wrath 
stained from the blood of the fallen  
and martyrs of madness 

I craved the rising star  
to Light this path of glory  
and walk in victories,  
leading a legion to the sun 

Marching through Fire and water,  
shine like son of God  
rising above and against the stars,  
I am almighty 

I call the son of sun  
to Rise within the mountains  
and Light this glorious end  
for my spirit to Divine 

Crawling among the Dead,  
perished in blood,  
never forsaken, always unbowed  
I shall reign
