Walk forth and bow to thee,  
those who bring the Light of life,  
those who fate observe in time  
will strike you greed and Rise above all mortals 

Slaves of a fallen God  
behold my vengeance 
Treasures Of Nemesis 
can you retaliate? 

Walk forth and bow to me,  
I am the holy one who come to conquer 
and strike the living form against the weakness,  
I've come to Light this path of vengeance 

Slaves of a Dead God  
behold my vengeance 
Treasures Of Nemesis 
can you retaliate? 

Living in your narrow-minded world  
you wished I never come 
cry loud for help, no one can hear you 
bowed to knees you pray but I won't save you 

I am the Light of life,  
I am the Light of life,  
I am the holy one,  
I am your Nemesis 

I am the Light of life,  
I am the Light of life,  
I am the holy one,  
I am your Nemesis
