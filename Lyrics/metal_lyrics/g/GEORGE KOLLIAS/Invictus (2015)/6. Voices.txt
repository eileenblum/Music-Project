Fragments of a sick mind  
sunk in illusions,  
pulling life into a vicious end,  
the Voices have spoken 

Behold, the dark Light continual  
in the edge of a sharp path you're walking alone 
beware, the black Flame Burns reflecting your end 
can't get read off Voices, scream in your head 

One mind, one pain, facing each other,  
a Dead soul walking the path towards the end 
a sickening day begins driven by sorrow and pain 
moments of a last cry, standstill while facing your death 

Sanity  
of insanity  
Echoes of hopelessness,  
the ecstasy of life! 

Fragments of a sick mind  
sunk in illusions,  
pulling life into a vicious end 

Walk forth, beyond the dark shades of Flame,  
the path seems so long with no doors at the end 
a sickening day begins driven by sorrow and pain 
moments of a last cry, standstill while facing your death
