Behold, our kingdom falls  
from beyond the sun and across the stars,  
we crawl like worms searching for Divinity,  
swim into the sea of rapture to Rise again 

God of thunder come Light the sky,  
cast us out from this world and walk beyond  
as kingdoms fall and crowns Burning  
now and shall ever be again 

We Rise from the ashes,  
we shall never Burn,  
Aeons of fear and abjection  
of Galaxies cursed to end 

As the Light of sun glows warmth upon us  
we speak the final word of savior,  
those who brought the Light, those who breathe wisdom  
revealed their hate upon all 

Darkness descents upon us,  
illuminates in shadow
