This is your Nemesis  
which comes to satisfy,  
this is fate and time  
and not just an illusion in your mind 

Days of darkened skies  
with drawn clouds raining lies,  
I've come to spread the sickness upon you  
urging your body and soul  
to walk the path of thorns;  
I've come to spread the sickness upon all 

Here comes the last cry  
that fades in misery  
those who failed shall stay sentenced in the fortress of weakness 
sinners shall Burn in lies  
and get Buried Under the Flames,  
I've come to spread the sickness upon all 

As skies fade to black and beauty fades  
your dreams are Burning in sins and lies 
I hear the Voice of weakness, I smell the fear within 
my will be done, I lay my rage upon your shredded soul 

No remorse means no return 
I am the sun of hope who Lights your trail 
behold the lord of justice that damned you to your grave 
living the afterlife you'll wish I'll let you born again - nevermore!â
