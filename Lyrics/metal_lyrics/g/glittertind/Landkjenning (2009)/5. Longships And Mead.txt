A long, long time, years ago way back in history.
There lived a folk with menb so bright sailing at the sea!

When times were rough,
and the weather was bad,
all night they fought the storm.
But when they made it to a pint,
they all began to sing!
Yeah, when they made it to a pint
they all began to sing!

Friends, raise your horns up high!
Let's drink to the sons of glory!
They were one!
With hearts so strong!
Far from where they belonged.
United stand!
Divided fall!
Wolves of the oceans were roaming:
from coast to coast,
from land to land,
hitting shores of sand!

And from this path of history,
their songs can still be heard.
When we gather in the pub,
a moment we'll be stirred:

When thinking of our good old men,
who sacrificed their lives.
For our freedom, our joy,
a wooden pint we'll raise!
For our freedom, our joy,
a wooden pint we'll raise!
