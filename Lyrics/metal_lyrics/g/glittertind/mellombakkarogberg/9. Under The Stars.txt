Eternity starts to fade in soft
the stars gathers under the fullmoon
Breathing under ruins crushed
The wind and the air whispers soon

Why do you think this is an everlasting source
We're just a part of the perspective
I yearn for the silence not the sickness of a force
making life nicer to live

Now time seems central in this chaos
But in the end we will all die
So why don't them just tell us
It doesen't matter how hard you try

Why do you think this is an everlasting source
We're just a part of the perspective
I yearn for the silence not the sickness of a force
making life nicer to live..
