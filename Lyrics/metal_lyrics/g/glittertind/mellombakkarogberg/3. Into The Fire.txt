The autumn lays over our long and icy land Reminding of the winters  that
have teard on the old man Now his time has come to leave this earth  To
Valhalla in his last battle  for his folk and new birth  Fighting for the
new generation,  for youth and for blood We know he has been a hero,  for
our seeds he have sown  Like a blue horizon,  and the clearest sky you can
think Like a spiritual emotion.  Of a gloomy sun down sink The contours of
the ancient warriors  whispers to a woman you are mine and I am yours  Into
the fire carrying the past,  His time has come at last. Towards victory, and
towards hope,  he knows he will finish his task The way she smile at him,
gives him his only guts To fight, and be free...  The gods of the mighty,
Thor and Odin Hail them all as we drift away like the wind Take your sword
take your helmet  you've got the power from afar By the stamina of your
ancestors victorious you are
