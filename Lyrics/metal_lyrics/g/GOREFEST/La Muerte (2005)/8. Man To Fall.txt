I'm not afraid to step out of the line
Never one to look back in time
Be aware I'm outspoken
You better keep that in mind

This is the time for man to fall
This is the time for man to crawl
This is the time

Don't look at me with those weary eyes
Don't look at me as if I'm telling lies
You know you hat it comming
You better keep that in mind

This is the time for man to fall
This is the time for man to crawl
This is the time
It' Time!!
