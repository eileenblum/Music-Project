With the paupers straight in line
You enter the holy land
One nation under god
And under god's command

When your people die
They are dyind for the sake of man
The truth will not be known
Because lying is all you can

Hello, hello is anybody out there?
Who sees the end of a nation
Hello, hello is anybody out there?
Who sees them live in the hell of their own creation

[Lead: B. F. B. F. B. F. B/F]

We're to watch the greatest show
The world will ever see
With a final push to force
A divine victory

Send your best men out in their finest hour
Don't tell them they're not gona live another hour

You're still made to to believe
You have democrasy
With a sense of reason long lost
And so is reality
