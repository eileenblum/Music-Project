Welcome to the age of paranoia
Say hello to the lies and propaganda
The realm of corporate misinformaton
The new gods of your generation

Welcome to the age of make believe
Fuck the poor and hail the thief
Live the dream of your own creation
A hell on earth, with no salvation

You'll know the price to pay for your greed
When you're laying down dead in the street

Knee keep in shit and smiling
You got to love the sound of crying

Prepare to die for you new gods
Learn to love it!
Still standing tall for contribution
Planting the seeds for retribution

You'll know the price to pay for your deeds
When you're laying down dead piece of meat
