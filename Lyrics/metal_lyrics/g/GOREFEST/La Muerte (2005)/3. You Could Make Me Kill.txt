Do you think is bizzare that the giant's been slain?
That you die by fire, if by fire you reign
It's a wake up call by a blow in the head
It's a man still walking knowing he's dead

Put your hands up to the sky
Were you stupid, were you blind?
As you realise
All you ever stood for was a lie

Do you think is obscene if you found your hell?
If you need the reason then I will tell
For all these years of being naive
And worshiping a breed of thieves

Put your hands up to the sky
Were you stupid, were you blind?
As you realise
All you ever stood for was a lie

[Lead: B]

You could make me kill
