Your future is at stake
From the womb into the grave

Reduced to a number
Not considered a great loss
Merely a statistic
What matters is the cost

[Lead: B]

Produced for battle
You will be slain
Highly trained cattle
What price to pay

Do you feel alive?

Liberation from the free of mind
Replacing them with your own kind

Malicious Intent

No right to speak and serving blind
Enslavement to the daily grind
(you spend your life in mental binds)

Malicious Intent

Do you feel alive

[Lead: B]

Your future is at stake
From the womb into the grave
