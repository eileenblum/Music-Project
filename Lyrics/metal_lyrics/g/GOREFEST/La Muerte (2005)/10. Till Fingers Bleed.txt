Question yourself
And everyone surrounding you
Nothing's sacred I'm telling you
The truth is out there
Find it with your own eyes
'till fingers bleed
Peel off the layers of lies

Fight yourself
And everyone surrounding you
Never give up, I'm telling you
Find yourself
No matter what the cost
'till fingers bleed
Peel off the layers of rules

Nothing's shoking when you realise
Truth is still the biggest lie

See hte millions lame as sheep
Dream salvation in their sleep
Show them that the end is near
Tell them I won't shed a tear
Ignorance comes at a cost
No absilution, no life lost

[Lead: B]

Nothing's shocking when you realise
Truth is still the biggest of all fucking lies
