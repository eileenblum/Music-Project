The sky is black and it's corpses I count
I look for life, none is found
Just hollow faces, my spirit's low
Just another show
The speaker says the end is near
Remain seated, live in fear
Hollow phrases, my spirit's low

Get away from this world asleep
The stench of lies, lessons in greed
This paranoia I detest
A clean escape my new found quest

When the daed walk the earth

The time has come to change your fate
The time has come to retaliate
No looking back, no remorse
No remorse

Get away from this world asleep
The stench of lies, lessons in greed
This paranoia I detest
A clean escape my new found quest

When the daed walk the earth

I see the dead
See them everyday
Pretending life
I've got to get away

[Lead: F]

Get away!!
