I've got the music for the masses
The pounding drums of slavery
Blood for oil from lower classes
Sold out for democracy

It's a war
And I want more
It's a war
Give me what I'm paying for

Put on war paints, bring out the flag
Kiss your loved ones now goodbye
Caveman days will soon be back
With death naw falling from the sky

It's a war
And I want more
It's a war
Give me what I'm paying for

With fear I buy the people's vote
I tell them tales of terror
Different cultures I just loathe
I am the god og error
