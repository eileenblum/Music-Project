Do you want a hint of your future?
Do you want to see the dead?
Do you want a glimpse of tomorrow
Rest assured, no life ahead

It's got to come
I know it's out there
I feel it present
Every break of dawn

Holy mother of impurity
Will you end this world for me?
The lair of lies
Restore the black of night for me

A final day
Of death and chaos
A grand finale
And you know you will pay
