Rotting from the inside out
The pain is intense, you're screaming loud
Bowels are burning, acid burns in your veins
You won't survive but die in pain
Eyes are hurting, turning black
You're decomposing, a human wreck
In agony you're crying out
As you coughed, a lung came out

Pus is flowing from the gastric
The putrid stench of human remains

Your intestines fall out, a bloody mess
Maggots feasting, eating your lost flesh
They crawl into you, via anal ways
Perforating your stomach within a day

Your remained guts have been gone
No more organs left to live on
Your brain is intact, still catching sounds
But there is only pus remaining on the ground

Pus is flowing from the gastric
The putrid stench of human remains
