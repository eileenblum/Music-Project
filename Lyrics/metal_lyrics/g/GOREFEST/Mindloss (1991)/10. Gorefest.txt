The deceased has been embalmed
Made ready for the family
The outside is still the same
But that's only visually
Formaldehyde been used
The organs have been gone
And the bucket of bowels
Is what we'll dine upon

Sluts masturbating
With bones of the deceased
Their guts no longer needed
Are such delicious meat
The necronymphomaniac who sees the coffin
With the corpse over the ...
...Vagina
She likes them soft and cold
She climbs into the coffin
Starts licking his putrid cock
Sucking it so heavily
It suddenly comes off

Necrastration
Deformed dwarfs are juggling
With separated heads
Distorted, morbid unlookers
Never more so glad
Steaming pits of defecation
Filled with corprophiliacs
Copulating abominations
A Gorefest at it's climax
