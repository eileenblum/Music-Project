End your life
Are there reasons to go on?
The pain won't hurt
Because you know you'll soon be gone
Relatives will mourn
Because of the loss of one beloved
In time they'll forget
You'll be gone in the past
As blood is flowing on
Your mind is feeling free
Dying isn't hard
It's happening so easily
Why should life
Only be ended by some god?
The decision is up to you
End it or not
Has mankind lost its sanity
Trying to reach for immortality?
The fear for dying is hidden deep
No faith in their eternal sleep
I was born alive
Isn't that punishment enough?
