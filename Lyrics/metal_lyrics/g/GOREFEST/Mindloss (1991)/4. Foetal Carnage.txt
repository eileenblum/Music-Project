Pregnant for nine weeks
By rape or promiscuity
Life is growing inside
Although it is not wanted
Life becomes hell
Days are passing slowly
Suicide will be sure
If abortion can't be practised

Tissue is carved and bleeds
The foetus is now executed
It's vacuumed from the womb
Birth will not be given

Tissue is carved and bleeds
The foetus is now executed
It's vacuumed from the womb
Birth will not be given

What's the right of the unborn child
When it will destroy its mother's life?
None!!!

Friends are no help
Their opinion is formed by others
Their religion says you're a whore
Your son is a condemned bastard

Tissue is carved and bleeds
The foetus is now executed
It's vacuumed from the womb
Birth will not be given
