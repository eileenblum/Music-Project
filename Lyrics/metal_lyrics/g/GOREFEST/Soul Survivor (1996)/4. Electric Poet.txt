I am driving on the left lane
On the highway through my head
For fame I gave my soul away
And never felt so glad

Electric poet in me
I am not afraid of words
Come and take me
Electric, electric poet in me

I got the gift to play with words
In writing, spoken too
A great magician I became
So now I'm tricking you

Electric poet in you
Are you afraid of words
Let me take you
Electric poet, electric poet in you
