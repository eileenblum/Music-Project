Your night is eternal
Dawn is never to be seen
Hide in isolation
Chase the dragon in your dream
A willing slave to darkness
A pleasure sacrifice
Kneel and beg the master
To look the dragon into the eyes

Hollow man dragon man

The fire inside is raging
Lurking in your heart
Burning up your life
Pain becomes your part
Cold hands that embrace you
A pleasure sacrifice
It's a half man who is begging
To look the dragon into the eyes

Hollow man dragon man

Once started as the hunter
You soon became the prey
You cannot understand
As your vision fades away
But the hunger is still raging
To feed it is your strife
Chase the dragon for the last time
Your final act in life
