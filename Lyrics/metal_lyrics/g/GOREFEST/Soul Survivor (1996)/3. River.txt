Clouds are covering the sky
Whis will be my last goodbye
Broken man in a broken land
Time has come to make amends

In this life now filled with darkness
I struggle on, seems so useless
And I hunger for the sun

The river flows on
As life flows on
Finding it's way
Leading me there where I will stay

Now fear is getting hold of me
Thinking of my destiny
The great unknown, as never seen
Places where I've never been

Still my life is filled with darkness
But I see a light, it makes me fearless
As I breathe and make the jump

The river flows on
As life flows on
Finding it's way
Leading me there where I will stay
