I tried to live six years ago
When this story started
The sun, it told me where to go
Open minded, open hearted

Freedom was my vision
Every breath a dream
A million years ahead
All is what it seems
Freedom was my vision
Every breath a dream

Or are you taken by surprise
Covering your sleepy eyes
The mocking bird won't sing for you
What ever happened
To these friends I knew

These friends I knew
Or was it just a dream
But dreams are for real
Life is how you feel

Freedom is my vision
Every breath a dream
A million dreams ahead
And they're all for real
Freedom is my vision
Every breath a dream

Breathe on!
