Time of confusion
Tomorrow, the unknown
A day still unborn
A face yet not shown

But I am going for the ride
With the rats I won't stay
While you hide and fear the sun
I kiss boredom away

Heading for a dog day
Just like today

Time of confusion
The death of us all
With a faith in fear
You're awaiting the fall

But I want to challenge fate
With the rats I won't stay
While I laugh in the face of death
I kiss boredom away
