I am the demon seed
The one solution for your breed
The limbs of the crippled
The minds of the mad
So foot on the feeble
So heavenly sad

Behind your eyes sleeps a life
Behind your eyes sleeps a life

I am the demon seed
I make you swallow all your greed
The speech of the serpent
The hands of the thief
The fool who is king
A misruler's grief

Behind your eyes sleeps a life
Behind your eyes sleeps a life
And I can make it come alive

I am the demon seed
Behind your weary eyes I sleep
I control your mind
I control your hand
Future dictator
Now you understand

I sleep behind your eyes
I sleep behind your eyes
I will live your life
I breed behind your eyes
