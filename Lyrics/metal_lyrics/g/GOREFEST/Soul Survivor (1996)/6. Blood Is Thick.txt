When the mind is blank
When all has been said
Never look back, always ahead

When the book's been read
Have no regrets
Never walk back, always ahead

My blood is thick, your words thin
Spread from a beggar's mind
My blood is thick, no regrets
'bout what I leave behind

And time is all I can lose, now time to choose
I choose my time
I feed off the hand that is mine
Nothing to lose
Only time

The mind is tired, beaten numb
By the stench from a beggar's mind
My blood is thick, beat yourself
I won't stay behind

And time is all I can lose, now time to choose
I choose my time
I feed off the hand that is mine
Nothing to lose
Only time

My blood is thick, your words are thin
My blood is thick, your words are thin
