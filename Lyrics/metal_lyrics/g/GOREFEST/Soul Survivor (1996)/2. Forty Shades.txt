I'm on top of the world
And I see
The pain from a thousand generations to be
Like lambs to the slaughter
Never free
Echoes of fear swirling around me

I'm on top of the world
And I see
The souls from the millions
That will never be free
Caged in their bodies
Down on their knees
Black clouds of fear swirling around me

Suffer forty shades of red
Suffer forty shades of black
Suffer forty shades of red
Suffer forty shades of black

Crawl
try to walk
Speak
free your mind
Breathe
and you will find peace of mind
free your mind

Suffer forty shades of red
Suffer forty shades of black
Suffer forty shades of red
Suffer forty shades of black
