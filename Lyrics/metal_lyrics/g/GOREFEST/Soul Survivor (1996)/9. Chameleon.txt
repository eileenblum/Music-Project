I never saw you arrive
Although you're always around
Making your day
Close to the ground
Around with the pigs
Feeding on what's left behind

Adapt your colours to my mind
Chameleon
Fooling all those who are blind
Chameleon
Adapt your colours

I never saw you leave that day
Fed on what was thrown away
A one eyed king
Leading to be blind
Ruler of pigs
Until nothing is left to find

Adapt your colours to my mind
Chameleon
Fooling all those who are blind
Chameleon
Adapt your colours
