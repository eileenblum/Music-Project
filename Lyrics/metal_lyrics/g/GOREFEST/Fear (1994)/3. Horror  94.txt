Smashed your head against the wall
Treatment comforts temporarily
Chastise yourself extremely
To neutralise chronic pains
Automutilation dwells deep in your soul

Inflicting pain
Your body suffers
While carving yourself
People can't understand
That you are forced to do it
A slave of your sick thoughts
For neurosis or lust

Carving layers of skin of your chest
An orgasm comes as reward
Your sick lust of pain
Will drive you to your suicide
Automutilation dwells deep in your soul
