Your mind is overtaken
By the ignorance of mankind
Stop thinking about your future
Just living for today
Living for today

But what's the point of your life
When you cannot think, just follow rules
When emotions are based on hatred
The truth upon lies

The downfall of humanity
Is caused by mass insanity
Neglecting of self consciousness
Leads to self-destruction

The killing of our environment
Means the end of our existence
You had your fun, your game to play
So it's only you who is to blame
It's only you who is to blame

The downfall of humanity
Is caused by mass insanity
Neglecting of self consciousness
Leads to self-destruction

You live in fear, it's now too late
Your future has been written
Your life will never be the same
Though it's only you who is to blame
It's only you who is to blame
