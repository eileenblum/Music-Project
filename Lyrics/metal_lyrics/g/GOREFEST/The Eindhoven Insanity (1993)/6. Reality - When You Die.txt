The final chapter's finished
The curtain is about to fall
Ending mediocre life
Nothing to be proud of at all
Thinking back now
Despising yourself
Feelings oppressed
Always ready to bow
It wasn't real life
In fact just a play
From which, you the actor
Got fired today

Your final walk down the hallway
No applauding masses in here
Not even dead and already forgotten
Your mind is filling with fear
Never any grip on situations
Your "life" just passed you by
And all the sudden it becomes clear
And insanity takes over now

You're not going out with a bang
You won't have "your" day
Your no longer wanted in this dull play
It wasn't real life
Never came close in a way
Your contract is over
Your finished today

And then you die
Part of a generation
Whose minds are all polluted
By the habit of consumption
No need to get a life
Everything's been taken care of
Your back bone is attached to strings
In the puppetplay you're part of

No it wasn't real life
It never came close in a way
It's a shame you found out too late
Reality is when you die
