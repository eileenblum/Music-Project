Expose yourself
As being honest living a good Christian life
Pretend to care for the really poor
With your charity they'll survive
TV-shows to raise huge funds
For refugees left to die
Flee from poverty, caused by war
Fought with weapons your provided

The truth, a bunch of lies
The majority believes
Religion a legal way
For murder, as they please

Malnutrition, civil
War millions live in poverty
For your last hope
Give what you can spare, religion means cash.

Creating wars to sell more arms
Buying governments, peace denied
Multinationals don't care for life
Bigger profits is their goal

The more I see
Strengthens my opinion
That you are polished shit
And I won't be a part of what you claim to be.
