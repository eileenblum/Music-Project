Open your eyes
At least try to see
What you are creating here
And tell me,
Do you really
Think that I can't see through this hypocrisy

What do you think
You made the rules
And that I will obey you
Well let me assure you
That I am human, I'm irrepressible
That I am human, I'm irrepressible
That I am human.

But deep in your mind
You admit your defeat
I'll stare you in your eyes
Till you bow your head
You tried to change me
You could not succeed
Because all that you hate
Is what I want to be.
