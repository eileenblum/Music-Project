Fool yourself, but don't fool me
I know what you are
No ideals but just an image
A weak disguise of your mind
A mind that is rotten
You're used to abuse

Be false, spread rumours, talk shit
That's really your way
But I can't be bothered.
You make people watch their back
Never face to face
They might see through your cover
Through your cover
Your second face

Cheating the ones that care
Your plastic face is always smiling
Pretended interest, you couldn't care less
You're not for real, I voice my disgust
Claimed intelligence, the fool you are
We're all laughing
What is it that you're trying to achieve?
Because you can never take my pride
You won't see that day

Take my hand
Take my arm
I can't be bothered
Take it all, you fool!

Cheating the ones that care
Your plastic face is always smiling
Pretended interest, you couldn't care less
You're not for real, I voice my disgust
But one of these days
Your plastic face will start to crack
And we'll create a new world
In which shit like you is banned

I await this day
