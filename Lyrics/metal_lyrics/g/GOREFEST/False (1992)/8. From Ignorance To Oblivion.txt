Look the opposite way
If someone explains his intentions
Criticising is what you good
At already formed your opinion

Don't bother to understand
That people have different ideas
About the way they live their lives
Despising greed and enviousness

The standards you live up to
Are purely based on hatred
Towards other cultures and races
Mankind would be better off without you
Without you

From ignorance to oblivion
