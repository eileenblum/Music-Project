I won't run or hide
Nor apologize
Accepting defeat
Is so unlike me
Often tried but never succeded
I can't be hurt
I believe in me
I'll walk my way
I'll walk my way
Challenging those who spread falseness
Strength through thinking
A never drying source
Hiding in fantasies
Ain't what I call lifes joy
Just accept
Reality
Life is to live it
And I love the pain
I'll walk my way
I'll walk my way
Challenging those who spread falseness
Never bowing down before those who try to harm
Never bowing, never before none
