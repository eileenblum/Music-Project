Like a flower
In wintertime
Like the autumn
Of your life
Freezing deep inside
Misery,
Misery embraced
Not a victim
No martyr here
Not a victim
Only a volunteer
Not a victim
No martyr here
Not a victim
Only a volunteer
You're like a goddess
A goddess in black
My goddess
A goddess in black
You're my goddess in black
