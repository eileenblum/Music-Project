Kinda alone
With a friend called fear
Locked up in a world
That's called your life

Talking to walls
That close in on you
Not able to run
You are frozen inside

Rest in your misery
Never to escape
It all has its reasons
It's all been arranged

On from day one
Thrown onto this world
Born in sin
Being the silent one

Fear
Fear
Of life
Of death

Hiding your fantasies
Deep down inside
They're never to see the light of day

The scales of balance
You have in your head
Are tipped against you
The burden you bear

Fear
Of life
Fear of life
Fight
Fight
For life
For pride

Refuse - Never crawl
Breathe - And you will win
Shame - No such thing
No burden - Is called sin

Fight
Fight
For life
For pride

Refuse - Never crawl
Breathe - And you will win
Shame - No such thing
No burden - Is called sin

Hiding your fantasies
Deep down inside
They're never to see the light of day

The scales of balance
You have in your head
Are tipped against you
The burden you bear

Fear
Of life
Fear of life
