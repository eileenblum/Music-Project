You are what you eat
A pig you are
Crawling in your dirt
Your mind is blank
Conscious black
Living just to hurt
Inherited by blood
You are supremist to the bone
Self acclaimed god that is
In a kingdom of your own
Low
Low
Low
A growing fear
Low
Low
Low
That you will die alone
Full of shit
You set the rules
That should be followed
Step by step
But I'll ignore
And walk proud
Head up to the sun
And I'm a fool
In your world of lies
But the one and only fool
Is looking through your own eyes
Now that the echo of the bang
Is still running through your head
Slicing through your brain
And taking all your dreams away
With fear in your eyes
In disbelief you start to weep
You still cannot believe
How you could fall so fast, so deep, so
Low
Low
Low
A growing fear
Low
Low
Low
That you will die alone
