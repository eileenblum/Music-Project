From the dawn of time and birth of man,
We are born to gather and breed like rats.
To quench our thirst,
We scorch the earth.
We are born to gather and breed like rats.

We feel supreme, god given right.
We are born to gather and breed like rats.
All this we need,
Makes us complete.
We are born to gather and breed like rats.

We rise to ruin when we race to get ahead.
Trapped in this man made madness.
We're born to consume, our values set.
We rise - to ruin!

So you collect the pain,
You collect the agony,
You collect the right to suffer for eternity.

You collect the hurt,
You collect the apathy.
Now you've evolved to total catastrophe!
