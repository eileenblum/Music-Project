Hail the dawn
Of the dying nations
You learn to love
So well
Crawl along
Without expectations
The golden age
of dehumanization!

If you live like a number
You die like a number!

You're breathing
Recycled air
a struggling
on borrowed time

Hail the dawn
Of the dying nations
You learn to love
So well
Crawl along
Without expectations
The golden age
of dehumanization!

If you live like a number
You die like a number!
