The systematic rape of the way I am living
It makes me mad, it makes me sad, it makes me unforgiving,
I'm sick of being silent.
I'm sick of being numb.
Whatever war they think they're winning, fuck it,
We have just begun.

Revolt!
Regardless of the outcome,
Our future is untold.

Revolt!
Revolt!
Kill with rage, die in flames,
The future is untold.

Twenty million graves are dug by catholic religion,
It makes me mad, it makes me sad, it makes me unforgiving.
I come to one conclusion -
No room for absolution.
Someone ought to shout you in the name of retribution.

Revolt!
Regardless of the outcome,
Our future is untold.

Revolt!
Revolt!
Kill with rage, die in flames,
The future is untold.

[INTERLUDE (Radio crackling):]
[Voice:]
'And yes, I can understand that it was quite disturbing for the majority of the population when the world leaders, both political and religious, were taken out of their offices and shot on the streets.
But, looking back at that day, it was by far the best thing the 21st-century brought us.'

Revolt!
Regardless of the outcome,
Our future is untold.

Revolt!
Revolt!
Kill with rage, die in flames,
The future is untold.

Where's the voice of the intellectuals?
Where's the burning barricade?
All I see is conformation to the ongoing rape!

Where's the killing of the tyrants?
Where's the death of the state?
All I see is conformation to the stalemate!
