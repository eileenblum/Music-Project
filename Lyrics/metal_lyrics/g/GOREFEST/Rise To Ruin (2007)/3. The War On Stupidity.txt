Back to the tribes,
Back to the nations.
A global war
On globalisation.

Arm yourself for the sake of common sense.
Shoot straight in the name of life's defence.
Shoot straight.
Better dying tall than living on your knees.
Fight this poor man's way of living is my plea.

Death to the slumber,
And the apathy!
A global war
On stupidity.

I want a revolution to speed up evolution,
This is our goal, this is our mission.

No intelligence, zero tolerance.
This is fact, this is no fiction!

Arm yourself for the sake of common sense.
Shoot straight in the name of life's defence.
Better dying tall than living on your knees.
Fight this poor man's way of living is my plea.

Shoot straight!
