[Little girl:]
'The only fear I know / the fear of my own mind / tor all the times I have rehearsed / the slaying of your kind.'

Can you please explain?
How an act of terror is defined.
A man battling an oppressor
Or oppression by a government.

Can you please define?
What you would call right and wrong
Perhaps the same old difference
Between weak and strong.

Do you understand?
That your life will never be the same,
That the rules have changed,
And those who hunted now are game!

With might you march and trample
What dissidents hold dear.
But your weakness and Achilles' heel
Is that you live in fear.

The only fear I know
The fear of my own mind
For all the times I have rehearsed
The slaying of your kind.
