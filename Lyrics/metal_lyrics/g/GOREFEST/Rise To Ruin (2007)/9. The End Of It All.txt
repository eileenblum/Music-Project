Feeling secure in the herd,
With your chin up high.
Happy to follow and obey.
Part of all, part of it all.

Every step you take,
Gets you closer to the line.
Will make you lose yourself.
Lose it all, lose it all.

And when you're down on your knees,
Just a number, there to bleed,
Time for you to draw the line,
Question it all, question it all.

With all your might you grasp.
Try to hold on to your life.
Time to change beliefs before you lose it all.

The end of it all!
The end!
