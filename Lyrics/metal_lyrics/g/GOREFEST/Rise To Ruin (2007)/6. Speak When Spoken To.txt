You call this life?
This dormant state.
Full control.
You vegetate.
Cast from one mould.
Billions alike,
The right to speak you wave goodbye.

Speak When Spoken To.

March at command,
No questions asked.
One straight line
Towards the end.
Cast from one mould,
Lemmings alike.
You've been kept stupid, kept silent.

Speak When Spoken To

The kissing of the flag
Guns locked and loaded.
I've seen this frame before.

Full of shit and righteousness.
High on divine blessings.
I've seen this frame before.

Speak When Spoken To!
