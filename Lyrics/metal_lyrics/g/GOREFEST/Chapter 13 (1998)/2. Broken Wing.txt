HERE COMES THE WHORE WITH THE BROKEN WING
WITH GRACE SHE COMES
LIKE AN ANGEL THAT REFUSES TO FLY
SHE WEARS THE CROWN OF THE WRONG
HERE COME THE WHORE FOREVER

HERE COMES THE WHORE WITH THE BROKEN WING
ALL HER PAIN WILL BE YOURS
MULTIPLIED BY A THOUSAND TIMES
AND SERVED WITH THE FINGER

HERE COMES THE WHORE FOREVER
(YOU'LL NEVER BE YOURSELF AGAIN)
HERE COMES THE WHORE FOREVER
AND SHE WILL BE FOREVER

YOU CAN'T SAVE YOURSELF

START YOUR MOURNING ON YOUR NIGHT OF DECAY
WHEN ALL YOUR CHILDREN ARE CRYING
YOU HAD IT COMING, SO LET DOWN YOUR HEAD
NOW THAT YOUR OLD WORLD IS DYING?

HERE COMES THE WHORE FOREVER
(YOU'LL NEVER BE YOURSELF AGAIN)
HERE COMES THE WHORE FOREVER
AND SHE'LL BE YOURS FOREVER

YOU CAN'T SAVE YOURSELF
