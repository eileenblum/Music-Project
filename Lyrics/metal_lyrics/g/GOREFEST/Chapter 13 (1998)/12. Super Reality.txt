ONE MORE DAY OF WRETCHEDNESS
A DAY YOU CAN'T FORGET
WITH KNEES THAT BLEED FROM CRAWLING
WITH A DEMON ON YOUR BACK

THE HOUNDS THEY BOT YOU BE THE THROAT
THEY NEVER LET YOU GO
YOU CUT THEIR HEADS OFF IN YOUR DREAMS
BUT THEY JUST DIE - REAL SLOW

I'M YOUR FALLEN ANGEL
I'M YOUR NEW FOUND HELL
I CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR
AND IT SUITS YOU WELL

YOUR STRUGGLR IS CONTINUING
SO MUCH THAT IT HURTS
YOU'VE COME TO FELL LIKE
FAR FROM HOME &amp; BLIND &amp; LOST FOR WORDS
