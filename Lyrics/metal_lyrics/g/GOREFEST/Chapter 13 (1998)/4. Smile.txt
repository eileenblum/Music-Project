DID YOU EVER DRAM
DID YOU EVER DREAM
DID YOU EVER DREAM ABOUT TOMMOROW
DID YOU SEE THE BLOOD
DID YOU SEE THE BLOOD
DID YOU SEE THE BLOOD AND FEEL THE SORROW

DID YOU EVER SEE YOURSELF
DANCING ON YOUR GRAVE

DID YOU EVER CRY
DID YOU EVER CRY

WHEN YOU WOKE UP COLD AND SMELLED YOU FEAR
YOUR FEAR OF THE WORLD
YOUR FEAR OF THE WORLD
YOUR FEAR TO GET HURT, BUT NONE WOULD EVER HEAR

DID YOU EVER SEE YOURSELF
DANCING ON YOUR GRAVE
WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE
