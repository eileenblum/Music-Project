KILL THE SANE, I'LL TAKE THE BLAME
I AM THE IDIOT WHO WON'T SEE OR CARE ABOUT HIS LOSS
WHY MOURN FOR WHAT NEVER WAS

KILL THE HERO, SAVE THE DAY
I AM THE IDIOT WHO LOVES THE WRONG
WEED OUT THE WEAK AND BECOME STRONG
BLAME ME FOR EVRYTHING
IT FEELS BETTER THAT ANYTHING - I TELL YOU

LET THE FREAK GET IN
LET YOURSELF GET INTO YOU

BLAME ME FOR EVRYTHING 
IT FEELS BETTER THAT ANYTHING
SHOOT THE HERO, KILL THE DAY
WHY DON'T YOU ALL GO AWAY
I AM THE IDIOT, I TELL YOU

LET THE FREAK GET IN
LET YOURSELF GET INTO YOU
