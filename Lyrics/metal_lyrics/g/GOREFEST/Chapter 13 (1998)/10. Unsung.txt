I'LL SACRIFICE THE LAND FOR YOU
I'LL KISS MYSELF IF I HAVE TO
YES I WILL SHOOT THE WORLD FOR YOU
AND HEROINE IF YOU WANT ME TO
AND I WILL DRAIN MY BLOOD AND KILL YOUR GOD
YOUR PLEASURE IS MY ONLY GOAL
I GOT THIRTEEN WRITTEN ON MY SOUL
I'LL FIND MY DARKNESS JUST FOR YOU
THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL HAS COME TRUE
AND I WILL DRAIN MY BLOOD AND KILL YOUR GOD

WE'RE THE UNSUNG
