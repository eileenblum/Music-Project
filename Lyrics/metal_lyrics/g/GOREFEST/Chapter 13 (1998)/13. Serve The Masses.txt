I'D TURN MY BACK &amp; WALK AWAY
IF I COULD SAVE THIS WORLD IN ONE MORE DAY
I JUST DO NOT FEEL THE URGE

I AM A SERVANT, I AM A SERPENT
AND I SERVE WHAT YOU DESERVE

I'VE WAITED FOR THIS WAY TOO LONG
THE FEELINGS NEVER BE SO STRONG
I WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW I FEEL

I AM A SERVANT, I AM A SERPENT
AND I SERVE WHAT YOU DESERVE

SERVING THE MASSES
SCATTER THE ASHES
TRAMPLE THE MASSES
SERVING THE ASHES
SERVING THE MASSES
