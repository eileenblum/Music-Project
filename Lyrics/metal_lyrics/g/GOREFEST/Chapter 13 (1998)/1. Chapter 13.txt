WE ALL GO DOWN &amp; I LOVE EVERY MOMENT
YOU PLAYED &amp; LOST &amp; YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT
AND EVRY DAY BREAKS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES
AND THE RATS LEAVE THE SHIP, ADMITING ISN'T EASY

COZ I'M ONE-FOUR-NINE ON A SCALE OF TEN
ALL YOU LOATHE IS WHAT I AM
-CHAPTER THIRTEEN

SHATTERED DREAMS &amp; A BAD MOON RISIN'
YOU DREAM OF HELL &amp; YOUR FEAR IS NO SUPRICE
AND I'M NO PROPHET BUT YOUR DOWNFALL IS TRUE
AND THE BACK OF MY HEAD IS NOW FACING YOU

COZ I'M ONE-FOUR-NINE ON A SCALE OF TEN
ALL YOU LOATHE IS WHAT I AM
-CHAPTER THIRTEEN

COZ I'M ONE-FOUR-NINE ON A SCALE OF TEN
THEREFORE I AM
-CHAPTER THIRTEEN
