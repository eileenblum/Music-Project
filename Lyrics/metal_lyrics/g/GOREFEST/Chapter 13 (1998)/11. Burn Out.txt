I AM FALLING APART 
I WANT TO TAKE YOU WITH ME
A BLOOD RED SKY IS BLEEDING ON ME

I AM FALLING APART
WHY DON'T YOU FALL WITH ME
A DANCE MACABRE THAT I WILL LEAD

FILE ME UNDER RUDE FOR WHAT I SAY
I'D RATHER BURN OUT THEN FADE AWAY
JUST TURN YOUR BACK AND WALK AWAY

WHAT FEEDS THE URGE THAT MAKES YOU SERVIVE
WHY FEAR DEATH - YOU WERE NEVER ALIVE
ONE THING I JUST REALIZED
YOU CAN KILL YOURSELF NOW - YOU WERE NEVER ALIVE

FILE ME UNDER RUDE FOR WHAT I SAY
I'D RATHER BURN OUT THEN FADE AWAY
