AN UGLY FACE - NO IDENTIFY
A QUEST FOR CHANGE - YOUR HISTORY
EMPTY EYES - VACANT MIND
I'LL CLOSE THE DOOR - LEAVE YOU BEHIND

ALL I SEE - FIXED BEAUTY
YOU ALL POSSESS - THE GREAT NOTHINGNESS

YOU THINK OF REASONS YOU'LL NEVER FIND
YOU LOOK FOR HELP - YOU ARE BLIND
I READ YOUR THOUGHTS, DIM &amp; SLOW
I SEE YOU NEON - IT SAYS GO

ALL I SEE - FIXED BEAUTY
YOU ALL POSSESS - THE GREAT NOTHINGNESS

YOU COUNT YOUR TIME, YOUR TIME IS THROUGH
I JUST CLOSED THE DOOR ON YOU
