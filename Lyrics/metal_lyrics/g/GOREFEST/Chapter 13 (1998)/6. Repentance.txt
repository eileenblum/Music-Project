I'M THE HARMONY DISTORTED
THE JIGSAW PIECE THAT DOESEN'T FIT
THE UNINVITED ONE WHO'S STAYING
IT'S ALL TOO SWEET, IT MAKES ME SICK

WHY REHEARSE THE SAME OLD PLAY
AND ASK FORGIVENESS ON OUR KNEES
PRAY FOR LONG LIFE, KEEP ON PLAYING
YOUR MENTAL WOUNDS WILL NEVER HEAL

I SEEM TO REMEMBER THE LENGH OF YOUR LIFE DOESEN'T MATTER
WHAT COUNTS IS THE KICK THAT YOU GET OUT OF IT
IF THIS WAS MEANT FOR ME, WHY FIX WHAT'S BROKEN ON PURPOSE

NO REPENTANCE
JUST GOODBYE
