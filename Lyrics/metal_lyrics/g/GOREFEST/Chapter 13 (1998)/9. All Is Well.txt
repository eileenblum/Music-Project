I WANT TO BE LIKE YOU
I'M GONNA BE LIKE YOU
ONE THING I CAN TELL
I'M GONNA BE REAL WELL

ALL I TOUCH TURNS TO SHIT
THIS IS MY SHARE OF SUCCESS
I'M WALKING MISERY 
FOREVER I WILL BE

AND I KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE FOREVER
WIPE OFF THE DIRT AND STRUGGLE ON FOREVER
ALL IS WELL

I NEVER WILL GO DOWN
I'M MODERN MAN - I NEVER WILL GO DOWN
