My greatest forgotten fears
Are growing in me
This oppressive quiet
Is tearing my humanity

When ever the light is afraid to shine
And only pale funereal candle make lighter my way in time
I don't remember if I was born or if I'm dead
I am and forever I will be
For ever I'll be alone
Alone with my sadness and melancholy
On full Moon night, my desperation rises to the zenith
Lost in the wood, I look up the sky, and she is there...

" You are not alone...you are mine...my groam.."

I'm not worthy of you... I am cursed
I have to kill for life... I am cursed forever

One day you 'll be here... I don't wanna fight and kill
We'll flight high together... I don't want to have blood on my hand
We'll reign together in the space... You are my queen and
I'm you slave
Whisper sweet words... I love you my Pale Lady

But wait....
I hear them! they're near me!
Fast I have to run,'cause my time is not yet to came
Please Goddess don't shine anymore and obscure their way
For I could run safely into your arms

I see the light... your light!
Now I am safe... in your embrace!
