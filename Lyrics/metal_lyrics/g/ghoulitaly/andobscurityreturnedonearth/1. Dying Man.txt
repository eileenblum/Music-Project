Help Me...

I feel the pain
The cancer's eating me
I feel my strenght's fading away
Contaminated blood
Prepare my grave

People are standing beside me
Waiting for my death
Crying and weeping
Laughing at my end

Call the priest who fucked my life
I wanna fuck him before my end is near
Before the dark mistress of death
Will hate my life for her lust

Satan open your doors of doom
And prepare for my coming
Bless my soul laughing at my death
Now I'm laughing 'cause I'm a dying man
