500 years are passed, when Templars killed a girl
She wore under her feet the sign of the cross,
She was a trampler

When she was passing away
Her soul arriver to the Lord of All the Hells
And, to Him, She raise he pray

"...for, I could came back under this or other rest
Having lust for life and to feed myself with other's death
Until you my Lord would like to recall my body full of blood
So I will serve you beneath your hellish hosts"

The Lord of All the Hell blessed her pray
And She returned on earth being a slave... for eternity
He imprisoned Her in the Haunted Palace made by Himself
So she had to crept in wet ground... or fly at dusk

And, again, obscurity returned on earth
Penetrating the body of a young girl
Sat on Her throne of bones
Living Her death to serve the Hell

"...Offering blood to the Lord of All the Hells
For their eternal alliance
For she could continue her great destruction"
