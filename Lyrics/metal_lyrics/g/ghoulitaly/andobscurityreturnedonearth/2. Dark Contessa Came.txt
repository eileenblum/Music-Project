Walking to the black night
Passing by the cold stone of graveyard
The Moon, my Mother, made of never-ending nights
Reveal at my eyes and I follow Her voice

Dark ruin were standing out over the plain
Protected by a ghostly wood
They spur me on to get there
From my blood... life after death

Funereal monument to fallen infernal progeny
Children of night raise their groams
I'm waited by the Dark Countess of Karnstein

The cruel contessa came
With her embrace of death
She dragged me in the sweet infernal oblivion
While my blood was flowing in her mouth

Oh sweet descent in the illusory heaven
Blood is life, given trough my death
Children of the night
Wonderful Lilith descendance..
