Split the morals of ancient rules
Their cross left red &amp; splintered
Old enough to remain
The lesser of two evils
Gods consuming man
Weakness turns fanatic
While they pray for another day
They kill themselves systematic

Lesser of two evils
God or man?

Blood spilled to protect
Lies used to reject
The fact that man is evil
When playing god
A cross a flag a priest a fag
I see no difference
All the same let's face a day
Without religion

Lesser of two evils
God or man?
Lesser of two evils
Their both insane

Split the morals of ancient rules
Old enough to remain
