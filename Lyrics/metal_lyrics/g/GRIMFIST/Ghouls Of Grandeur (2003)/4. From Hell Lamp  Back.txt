No turning back no bowing down
The past has served us well

Grow that hair drink that beer
Live without remorse or fear

From hell &amp; back
We carve ourselves a name
Cause this is more than music
A lifestyle to the grave

No turning back no bowing down
The past has served us well

From hell &amp; back
From hell &amp; back

From hell &amp; back
We carve ourselves a name
Cause this is more than music
A lifestyle to the grave
