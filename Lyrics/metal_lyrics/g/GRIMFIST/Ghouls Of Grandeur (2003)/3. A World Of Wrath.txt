I embrace a world of wrath
A path so grim &amp; horrid

No illusions no god or goat
No dying worthless mimic weakness

Written words without proof
I choose life without an ending
A hardcore life, alcoholic
I'll be the last man standing

A world of wrath
Blood for blood
A world of wrath
A path so grim
A world of wrath
Blood for blood
A world of wrath

(Drinking)
A world of wrath blood for blood
(Bleeding)
A world of wrath consuming me
(Fighting)
I hail the path of horror
(Fucking)
Burning bridges leaving the past
Behind

Drinking, bleeding, fighting, fucking
I choose life without an ending
I'll be the last man standing
Drinking, bleeding, fighting, fucking
