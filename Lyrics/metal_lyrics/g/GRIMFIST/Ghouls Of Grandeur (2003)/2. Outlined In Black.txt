Feel the needle split the skin
Self inflicted shades of sin

Grey the demons face
Outlined in black
Embrace the skin
No going back
In lines so pure
&amp; sterilized
The grim is born
To stay for life

See the needle
Pierce the skin
Shades are growing
Wounds of ink

Scarred for all time 
Painted skin forever
