There's no time (to) fuck around
How hard can it be?!!
Head straight for (the) fucking
Nerve
Take a stand be a man

No compromise
No compromise

Nowhere left (for) you to hide
Time for you to decide right now
Kill the (painted) smile
(Or keep the) face &amp; lies

No compromise
No compromise

Bleed black or white now
No in between
Can't run forever
Hiding in a dream

There's no time
Black or white
Be a man
Take a stand
(Be a man take a stand more then a goat signed hand)

You play tricks
On yourself
To me you're
(As) clear as day
(Posing &amp; talk don't fool me, too bad your own 2 eyes cant's see this)
