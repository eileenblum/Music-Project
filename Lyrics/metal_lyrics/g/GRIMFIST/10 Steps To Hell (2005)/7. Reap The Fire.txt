Turn around and look at me
Now do you see a motherfucker?
A prejudistic asshole in black and white
Then take the time and redefine why you're even alive

Searching Higher
Or embrace the fire of hell
Reap the fire

Turn around and look at me
Now do you see a motherfucker?
A sadistic redneck inhaling life?
Then take the time to redefine
Why I'm even alive?

Step into this darkness where life is beyond
Step into the shadow where life is dead and gone
