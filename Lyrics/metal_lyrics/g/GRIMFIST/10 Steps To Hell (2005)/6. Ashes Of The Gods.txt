I, I wish the sky was gray
The day as black as shadow
The blood in my veins
Turn into flames

Crawl into oblivion hail the dead
Ashes of the god to high to fall

Nothing becomes everything
This is my alteration

The ashes of the gods [x2]

I, I wish the sky was gray
The day as black as shadow
The blood in my veins
Turn into flames

The ashes of the gods
