A monument in time
A proof of having been alive
Evidence of existence
Beyond the naked eye
There's chaos in control
Visions clash and breed apart

A new level of commitment
In time this world will see
That this is real

No one, nothing will ever change
This word will always remain the same

A new level of commitment
In time this world will see
That this is real

A monument in time
A proof of having been alive
Evidence of existence
Beyond the naked eye
There's chaos in control
Visions clash and breed apart

Forgetting the past is ignoring the future [x2]

No one, nothing will ever change
This world will always remain the same
