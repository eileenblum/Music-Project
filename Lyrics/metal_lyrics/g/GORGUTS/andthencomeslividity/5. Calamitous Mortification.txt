Lie in my bed
Waiting for my fate
Will I live again
Or is it too late?

Fight this unbearable war
That I didn't choose
So how can I know,
If I win or lose?

Scream to bear this pain
That's enough to go insane
Tons of questions are in my head
And the only answer I found is death

Intoxicate my body
To leave the stage of agony
In hope of getting an ease
I'll never lose the vicious disease
Treatment is always the same
No results are yet obtained
I'm digging a grave in my bed
O dear god wish a was dead...

The only good thing
Doctors decided to do with me
Was to sample parts of my body
For a elaborated study

Calamitous mortification
Is the main cause of my mortality
Leave my body to putrefaction
I will be the mortician's depravity

Lie in my bead
Waiting for my fate
Will I live again,
Or is it too late?

Fight this unbearable war
That I didn't choose
So how can I know,
If I win or lose?
