Every body wants to see
The other sides of misery
The best example they could get
Is when they take their last breath

There's a world, we had all wished to see
Far away in infinities
It's miraculous, you have been told
But for now you can't behold

Tell me why, why do we die?
You will answer me, because!
Anyways, I don't mind
We will never know the cause

Reincarnation is the most obscure thing
That we can't be sure
We shall all come back to accomplish
All the things we missed in the past

Metempsukhosis
Migrate souls
From one body to another
And gives them birth
In a new mother
