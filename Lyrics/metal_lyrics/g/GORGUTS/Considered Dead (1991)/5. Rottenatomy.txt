I've been lost in a jungle
For an hour and fifteen days
Hopelessly searching for exits
In this lethal maze

Footsteps I have taken
Each one driving me insane
Always turning in circles
In this hostile jungle

Having dropped my last piece of food
The most vital thing I never wished to loose
I slipped and found myself in a dark place like hell
At the bottom of a pit where I had fell

Surrounded by a rancid smell
Of corpses that previously fell
Among bones shredded flesh and crawling maggots
Then I knew that I shall stay there to rot

Gashes appearing everywhere
Scars I'm wishing in despair
Before maggots devoured my insides
I'll commit myself to suicide

Above me I heard people talking
Having lost my voice, I was unable to scream
They had a look and saw me lying in my knees
Then went away thinking I was deceased

Below me no one is talking
If you have your voice, just once you're screaming
Have a fast look before falling on your knees
No hope is left when you are deceased
