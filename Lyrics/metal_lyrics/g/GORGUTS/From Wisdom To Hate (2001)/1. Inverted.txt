[music: Lemay / lyrics: Lemay]

Truth before your eyes
Sheltered you in lies
Through the cross, you'll find
The peacefulness once promised

Flesh denied for life
By using Christ as an acolyte
Enrolled in reclusion
Serenity will be just illusion

Upright you praise the serpent
To God, you claimed being a servant
Through sin, within you hold
Your feebleness and filthy soul

Why preaching about love and hate
When blindness enlighten your own faith
Inverted behavior
Integrity is the only saviour

Deep, is, your devotion
For the left-hand side
Peace, you cannot give
To the confessed ones

False, is, your compassion
For the crucified
In which your trueself
Will persist to hide

Truth before your eyes
Sheltered you in lies
Through the cross, you'll find
The peacefulness once promised

Flesh denied for life
By using Christ as an acolyte
Enrolled in reclusion
Serenity will be just illusion
