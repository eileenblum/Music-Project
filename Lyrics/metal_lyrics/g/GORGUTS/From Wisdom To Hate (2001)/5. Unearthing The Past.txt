[music: Mongrain / lyrics: Lemay]

Relics captured in stratas
For millennia, have been sleeping
Secrets of buried scriptures
Are whispered through the sound of wind

Kingdoms or dormant splendors
For millenia, have been sinking
Speeches of buried surfaces
Are roaming through the seas of sand

Realms, once back to light
Archa-speeches are told
Realms brought back to sight
Archapolis behold

Rising the fragments
Signs of previous lives
Told to the present
Lores of ancient times

Unspeakable beauties
Ruins of fabled places
Soiled testimonies
Of ancestors' races

Relics captured in stratas
For ages, have been hiding
Echoes from a lost era
Can be heard through the sounds of wind

Kingdoms of radiant splendors
For ages, have been shining
Conquest of the conquerors
Are covered by the seas of sand

Unearthing the past
Knowledge...concealed
To the unborn one
Unearthing the past...
