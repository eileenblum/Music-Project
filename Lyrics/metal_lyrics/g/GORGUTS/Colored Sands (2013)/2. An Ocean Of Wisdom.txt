"A year after his last words were circulated throughout the land, the 13th Dalai Lama died. According to custom, his body was embalmed, dressed in gold brocade robes, placed in the lotus position and seated facing south- the direction of long life-...Checking the Dalai Lamas corpse one morning, attendant monks entered its sealed chamber and found that the head had moved. No longer facing south, it had turned towards the northeast. Repositioned, it was again discovered facing east. In the ensuing months further signs appeared.
[John. F Avedon, In Exile from the Land of Snow]

Being left soul-abandoned, facing south
As a new born one
Seeds o compassion, shall be found
The oracle's trance told mystical signs
Incarnation's quest
Leading towards the rising sun

To the lake of visions
For answers, they will seek
Staring peacefully
Omens through the waters
Amongst majestic peaks
Letters, clearly seen

Ah-Ka-Ma

Auspicious journey
Foreshadowed signs revealed
Guiding prophetically
Omens, to be answered
A young child, they will meet
Chosen, shall he be?

To the lake of visions
For answers, they will seek
Staring peacefully
Omens, to be answered
A young child, they will meet
Chosen, shall he be?
