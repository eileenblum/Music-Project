"Tibet is a land of timeless, infinite expanse. The highest region on the planet is a vast plateau, six times bigger than Western Europe...For centuries, it was known as a forbidden, inaccessible, and secretive realm, sequestered from the world by its altitude and bordered by an often impassible mountain range, the mightiest in the world."
[Jonathan Green, Murder in the High Himalaya]

Earth met sky
In a place yet unchanged by time
Silence through heights can be heard
As peace roams high

Fortress of mist and peaks
Nature gave to man contemplation
Leading to divine inspiration

Mystic land
Sowed a seed of wisdom in man
Leading one's mind to embrace
A truthful life

Fortress of mist and peaks
Nature gave to man contemplation
Leading to divine inspiration

Tall
Beyond clouds, they stand
Ridges
Where the world began

Throughout summits reside
Reclusive, hate-less minds
