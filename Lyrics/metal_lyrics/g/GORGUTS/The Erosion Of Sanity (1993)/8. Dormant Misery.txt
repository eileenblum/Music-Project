Deep inside
Beyond all conceptions
Unconsciousness hides
A comatose existence

As your mind falls asleep
A second life is awakening
Far beyond imagination
The world of dream is where...
Your second soul will perish... Endlessly

Lands which no one's seen before... Dark as hell
There, alone, you are in this vault of fear

In imagination, time does not exist
'Till the end you'll bear this dormant misery
This dormant misery

[Lead: Lemay]

As you were opening your eyes
Your soul reinstates in consciousness
Reinstates in consciousness

Once the shades of reality disappear
In the shades of mortality they reappear

Far beyond
Dark imagination
Unconsciousness hides
A comatose existence

[Lead: Marcoux]

Next time when you fall asleep in your bed
Stiff and cold you'll be... dreaming with the dead

Line-up:
Luc Lemay: vocals, guitar, piano
