A way to travel
Discover and explore
Through man's anterior lives
To learn unspokenlores
Regression of the mind
Can't make it possible
To bring back existence
Where you had once dwelled before

Dormant souls... Resurrected

A brain transfer
From a sick man to a fresh cadaver
Prolongs the phases
To scan beyond his alzheimer
A rediscovery
Of lives which were forsaken

Avoid the frips of mortality
From the end life begins
Awakening of previous entities... Gensesis origins

Once revived
The brain functions would all deteriorate
His mental and physical
No longer would respond
When they split his skull apart
His brain and soul was gonl... Mysteriously

A way to travel
Discover and explore
Through man's anterior lives
To learn unspokenlores
Regression of the mind
Can't make it possible
To bring back existence
Where you had once dwelled before

Mortal fool.. mutilated
