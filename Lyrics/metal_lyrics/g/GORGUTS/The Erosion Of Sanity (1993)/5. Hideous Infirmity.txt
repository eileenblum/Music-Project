Suddenly facial remains everywhere
Perpetual disfigurement that I'll have to bear

My hideous infirmity
Brings disgust to their faces
Destined to have a mask
Stuck on my face forever

Unconscious, here I lie
As I'm waiting my demise
The only thing that I had in my mind
Was to leave this world for a better life
But I never thought I would fail
My inflicted homicide

Grafting and countless surgeries
Just can't embellish my monstrosity

Grafting and countless surgeries
Just can't embellish my monstrosity

[Lead: Marcoux]

Gruesome scars on my face
Which will never be erased
Having lived with this pain in mind
Make me see this world through a different eye
But it's up to them to change
Their biases inside

When I came near losing my own life
It made me learn the true meaning of a smile

My hideous infirmity
Brings disgust to their faces
Destined to have a mask
Stuck on my face forever
