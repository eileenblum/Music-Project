Since the earth was devestated
I alone, got isolated
Where daylight can't penetrate
Trapped beneath remains, I wait

Crawling survivors
Are screaming for life on their knees
Soon to be discovered
Stench-filled carcasses underneath

For such a long time
I've been trapped
So I can't tell if it's day or night
If only my cries
Could reach the surface
Inhabitated by mankind

They're searching for lives
Deception prevails, more corpses are piled
If they run out of time
Nothing more than shreds of carrion they'll find

Odors of existence

[Lead: Marcoux, Lemay]

If you smell the odours
To a rotted death it will lead
But among these odours
I'm still undiscovered beneath
