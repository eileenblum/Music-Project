Dead with pride
Hopelessness behind...I ascent
Feeble minds
Regret in their eyes...They repent
Inner horizon
I glorify my death in peaceful solitude
Obscure concept of blissful imagery
Rapturous Grief

AS my soul rises Transparency, I reach...
far from this world, I'll be 
Lost within darkness
Timeless dormancy is
where now I shall dwell
Cast beyond mortals
The faceless ones, I meet
The faceless ones are cleansing me

Grotesque earthly love behind
I leave the sun behind
Splendid fluid transparency ashore
Within darkness, I dwell

The carnal state, I escape
Life is now a part of past extracted from me
The carnal state I forsake
Death is now a part that 
Last longer than life and its misery

Mindless soul
Pure consciousness
My internal dream was my eternal fear

[repeat 1st verse]
