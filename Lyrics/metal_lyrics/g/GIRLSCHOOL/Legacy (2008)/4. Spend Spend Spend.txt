[Enid Williams]

Spending all my bread, sink into the red
Going on a spending spree
Heading for a crash, already spent the cash
City crook economy

Sold the family silver, to the highest bidder
Chancellor sold the gold reserves
Getting hard to borrow, pay the bills tomorrow
Brokers gone and summons served.

Wheel of fortune, turns around

Spend Spend Spend
Bidding for the country, selling England by the pound
Spend Spend Spend
Gotta get a loan in, payback time is coming round

Racking up the debt, debt collector's pet
In a never, never land
Pluto changing coat, archer to the goat
Head's are buried in the sand

Got deregulation, found an offshore haven
City bonus, all time high
Offshore spoils are hidden, auctioneers are bidding
Now the coffer's running dry

Wheel of fortune, turns around

Spend Spend Spend
Bidding for the country, selling England by the pound
Spend Spend Spend
Gotta get a loan in, payback time is coming round

Spend Spend Spend
Bidding for the country, selling England by the pound
Spend Spend Spend
Gotta get a loan in, payback time is coming round

Spend Spend Spend
Wheel of fortune, turns around
Spend Spend Spend
Wheel of fortune, turns around
Spend Spend Spend
Spend Spend Spend
