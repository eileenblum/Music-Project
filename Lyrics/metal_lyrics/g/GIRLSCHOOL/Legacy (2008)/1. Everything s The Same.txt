[Kim McAuliffe]

Everything's been done before
Everything's been done and more
Trying to find something out of the blue
Trying to find something else to do
Everything's the same
Everything's seems the same
Where's the fun Where's the game
Everything's feels the same

Always looking for something new
Looking for something to say or do
I'm so bored being here with you
Every little thing that we say

Wasted days and wasted nights
This time I'm gonna get it right
Looking for an open door
That I've never been through before

Always looking for something new
Looking for something to say or do
I'm so bored being here with you
Every little thing that we say

Sometimes I will
Sometimes I won't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes it's bad
Sometimes it's great
Sometimes I feel I can't stand to wait

Always looking for something new
Looking for something to say or do
I'm so bored being here with you
Every little thing that we say

Always looking for something new
Looking for something to say or do
I'm so bored being here with you
Every little thing that we say
