[Jackie Chambers - Kim McAuliffe]

You didn't like it
When I said no
You didn't want it
When I asked you to go

What could have led you
You to believe
Was it the skirt
Above my knees

Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
It's something you'll regret
I said
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
You'll wish we'd never met

Was it the way
I flicked my hair
Was it the way I said that
I did not care
You didn't mean that
That much to me
Now you'll be written out of my history

Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
It's something you'll regret
I said
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
You'll wish we'd never met

Be careful who you talk to
Be careful where you walk to
He might just take your life
And that's no way to say goodbye

Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
It's something you'll regret
I said
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
You'll wish we'd never met

Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
It's something you'll regret
I said
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
You'll wish we'd never met

Don't mess
Don't mess
I said
Don't mess
Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
I said
I'm gonna looking for you
Don't mess
Don't mess around with me
