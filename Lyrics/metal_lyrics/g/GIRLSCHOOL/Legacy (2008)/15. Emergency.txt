[Enid Williams - Kelly Johnson - Kim McAuliffe - Denise Dufort]

Can't make out, things they said
Spent too many nights getting out of my head
Must be mad, must be blind
Driving me crazy right out of my mind

9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency

Can't think straight, can't decide
'Cause time's running out and there's nowhere to hide
Where to run, what to do
Better watch out, cause they're coming for you

9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency

Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency
9-9-9 Emergency, emergency

Emergency, emergency
