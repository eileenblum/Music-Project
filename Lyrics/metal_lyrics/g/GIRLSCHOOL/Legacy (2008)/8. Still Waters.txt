[Enid Williams]

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep

Don't drown in the shallow water
Of Words that bring you down
The fountain rises up again to reach the sky
And if you should forget
Retreat within your shell
Just keep your head above the water line
And soon the tide will turn

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep

Don't drown in a sea of troubles
And words that pull you down
The phoenix rises up again to reach the sky
And if you should forget
To listen to the wising well
Just ride the storm until it's past
And soon the tide will turn

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep

When the moon is at her brightest
Embrace the water, rising higher
When your cup is running over
Touch the night and gaze into the sky

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep, deep, deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run
