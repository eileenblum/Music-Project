[A Tribute To Kelly Johnson]

[Jackie Chambers]

Sexy girl she bought a guitar
Played the damned thing all day long
Her father knew she'd be a big star
Once she wrote that hit song

Played along to every record
Knew she'd be that good soon
Knew in time there'd be some rewards
For all those years spent in her room

She was the one, everybody loved
Remembered forever
By everyone she knew
She was the one everybody loved
A legend forever
We're so glad we knew you!

Joined a band, got to play live
So much to give, so much to prove
A marshall amp, an overdrive
Had her sound and her first review

Toured the world and made the charts
Years went by, she'd reached her goals
Made some friends and broke some hearts
Sex drugs and rock and roll

She was the one, everybody loved
Remembered forever
By everyone she knew
She was the one everybody loved
A legend forever
We're so glad we knew you!

Time came to leave the band
Another life in a different place
Swapped rain for sun, sea and sand
This girl was hard to replace

It didn't work out, came back home
Back how it used to be
Would have changed if she'd only known
Our greatest tragedy

She was the one, everybody loved
Remembered forever
By everyone she knew
She was the one everybody loved
A legend forever
We're so glad we knew you!

She was the one, She was the one,
Remembered forever
She was the one,
She was the one, She was the one,
A legend forever
