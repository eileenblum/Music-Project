[Jackie Chambers - Denise Dufort - Lemmy Kilmister - Kim McAuliffe]

Just when I thought
It was safe to go outside
You came along
I said take me for a ride
You said something
We nearly came to blows
I said somebody better
Get me one of those

Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me

You got to know
There's only you and me
It's such a shame
We don't know who we want to be
What can I say
When you tell me I'm your man
Those were the days honey
Catch me if you can

Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me

Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
