[Jackie Chambers - Denise Dufort]

Fighting frustration, losing the battle
Feeling aggressive, can't seem to settle
It goes without saying; it's too hard to be without you,
Without you.

Dry with this talking, time to start drinking
Stop when I pass out, kills the thinking
It goes without saying; it's too hard to be without you,
Without you.

It's just another day
Just another day
Just another day without you, without you
Just another day
Just another day
Just another day without you, without you

Reduced to a shadow, eating's a habit
Go through the motions, no longer matters
No surprise saying, it's too hard to be without you
Without you

Turning the corner, cheating the devil
An eye to the future, not here forever
No surprise saying, it's too hard to be without you
Without you

It's just another day
Just another day
Just another day without you, without you
Just another day
Just another day
Just another day without you, without you

Find a reason to get out there
Take each day in my stride
Catch a breath and be grateful I'm alive

Every new day face a problem
Getting easier to do
When every day I get my strength from you.

It's just another day
Just another day
Just another day without you, without you
Just another day
Just another day
Just another day without you, without you
