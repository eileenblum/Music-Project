[Kim McAuliffe - Kelly Johnson]

I was feeling like nothing on earth
Bored with everthing
With lots of wine I could feel fine
Looking like something that the cat dragged in
Take a walk down by the Thames
Throw myself in and have a swim
Down the Prince Of Wales
It never fails to bring a smile

Oh you got everything
Everything and more
Oh you got everything
Oh you got everything
Everything and more
Oh you got everything

And the streets are paved with gold
So many secrets still untold
Neon lights are shining bright
I dance away the night
Up the junction
Round the bend
Will this madness never end
Crazy people everywhere
Down in Soho Square

Oh you got everything
Everything and more
Oh you got everything
Oh you got everything
Everything and more
Oh you got everything

I've seen the desert at sunrise
Like fire in the skies
Mountains giant blue and cold
Rivers running gold
Tokyo and Amsterdam
New York, Paris and Milan
When you come back into view
Nothing dares compare to you

Oh you got everything
Everything and more
Oh you got everything
Oh you got everything
Everything and more
Oh you got everything

Oh you got everything
Oh you got everything
Oh you got everything
Oh you got everything
