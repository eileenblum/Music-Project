[Jackie Chambers - Enid Williams - Kim McAuliffe]

Be careful what you do now
Be careful what they now
They're watching every movement
Every place and where you go

You're under their surveillance
Be sure to toe the line
In the name of your security
The innocent stand trial

Playing I Spy in the sky
Big brother's up above
They've got you in their sights
Escape the private eyes that pry

If you've not done wrong yet
There's nothing there the fear
We sleepwalk into darkness
As freedoms disappear

Their criminal intentions
Will put the blame on you
No crime has been committed
But they watch in case you do

Playing I Spy in the sky
Big brother's up above
They've got you in their sights
Escape the private eyes that pry

Playing I Spy in the sky
Big brother's up above
They've got you in their sights
Escape the private eyes that pry

Playing I Spy in the sky
Big brother's up above
They've got you in their sights
Escape the private eyes that pry
