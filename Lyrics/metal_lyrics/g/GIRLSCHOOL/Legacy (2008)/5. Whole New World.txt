[Enid Williams - Jackie Chambers]

It's a Whole New World
When you hear, when you speak no evil
See, when you hear, when you speak no lies
See, when you hear, through the deafening silence
See, when you hear, when you speak your mind
See, hear, speak, lies See, hear, lies

It's a Whole New World
And the emperor has no clothes on
Bare to the skin and the child cries out
Shout when they come, when they come for them
When they come for you who's left to shout
Shout, shout, shout, shout, shout, shout, shout

It's a Whole New World
It's a Whole New World

It's a Whole New World
What you say, neither rhyme nor reason
Do what they will and they turn it to law
Say what you will, it's an act of treason
Do what they will is the whole of the law
See, hear, speak, truth See, hear, truth

It's a Whole New World
Rage, against the lying
Of the sacred, ancient rights
Rage, rage, against the dying
Held as sacred, ancient rights
Rage, rage, rage, rage, rage, rage, rage

It's a Whole New World
It's a Whole New World

It's a Whole New World
It's a Whole New World
It's a Whole New World
It's a Whole New World

It's a Whole New World
It's a Whole New
