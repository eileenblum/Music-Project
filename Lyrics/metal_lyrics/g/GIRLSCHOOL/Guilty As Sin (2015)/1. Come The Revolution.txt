When the truth it strikes you like a lightning rod
And you can't hold it in anymore
Then the pressure builds to breaking point
And the lion starts to roar

Cry, out, the sound of our fury
We shall stand as judge and jury
The beast and the whore, shall stand by the law
And we shall sound the call

Come, come, come the revolution
Hold us down and we shall rise
Come, come, come the revolution
Raise our voices to the skies

They're thinking the unthinkable
And feed us cock and bull
We've been drinking the undrinkable
But now the cup is full

We're taking a stand and staking the land
That lies beneath our feet
The web of lies have come unspun
The future has begun

Come, come, come the revolution
Hold us down and we shall rise
Come, come, come the revolution
Raise our voices to the skies

Come, come, come the revolution
Come, come, velvet revolution
Come, come, come the revolution
Come, come, viva la revolucion

Come, come, come the revolution
Hold us down and we shall rise
Come, come, come the revolution
Raise our voices to the skies
