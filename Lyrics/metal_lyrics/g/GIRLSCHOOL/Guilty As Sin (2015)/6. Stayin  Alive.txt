[originally by The Bee Gees]Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around
Since I was born
And now it's all right, it's OK
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Time's effect on man

Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
You know it's all right, it's OK
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Time's effect on man

Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Life goin' nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere
Somebody help me.
Somebody help me, yeah
Stayin' alive

Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around
Since I was born
And now it's all right, it's OK
And you may look the other way

The New York Time's effect on man

Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Life goin' nowhere
Somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere
Somebody help me.
Somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
