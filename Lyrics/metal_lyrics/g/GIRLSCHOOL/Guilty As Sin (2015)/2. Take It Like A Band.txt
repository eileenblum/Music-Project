East to West, back again
Motorway, madness, it's insane
Locked in, packed in like sardines
All we want to do is scream
No way out, no escape
Sat nav says the wrong way
Feeling like groundhog day
Tell ourselves it's all OK

Too many late night
Getting out of hand
But then you have to take it
Take it like a band

Glasgow - London in a day
Let's do Swansea on the way
All for one and one for all
Warlord gap, we can hear your call

Too many late night
Getting out of hand
Too many stage frights
And living in a van
But so many great nights
Got to understand
Why you have to take it
Take it like a band

Take it like a band
