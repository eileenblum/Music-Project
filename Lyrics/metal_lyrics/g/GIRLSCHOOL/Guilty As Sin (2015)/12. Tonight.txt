Time to get away, forget about today
Take the chance and go out on the run
Been here too long, nothing going on
Find a place where I can have some fun

I've had enough and now I'm through
There must be better things to do

Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight

Time I got away, finished with the day
Make a move and go out with the crowd
Getting in a state, want to stay up late
Find a place where the music's turned up loud

I've had enough and now I'm through
There must be better things to do

Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight
Alright!

Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight

Tonight!
