But I can take you high as a kite every single night
I can make you jump out of the bed standing on my head

Well there's no one like the man I am

You know
I can take you over the hill oh what a thrill
I can make you sell me your soul for only rock'n'roll

You'll never believe it
Come on, come on
I said you'll never believe it
Come on, come on
You'll never believe it
Come on, come on

Do you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang
Do you wanna be in my gang, oh yeah
