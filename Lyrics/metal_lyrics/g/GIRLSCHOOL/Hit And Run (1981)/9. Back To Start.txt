Looking backwards from a distance,
Memory confused
Trying to see my motivation,
Solutions that I've used
But there seems to be
Nothing left but me
All I'm able to see
And now clap your hands
Because I made up my mind
I'm back to start

Moving forward toward my future
All my problems solved
Thinking all alone
Safety of my home
Things I call my own
And now they're left behind
Because I need some time
I'm back to start

Things don't seem the same
Given time to change
Sometimes I'm so strange,
And now they're left behind
Because I need some time
I'm back to start

Back to start
