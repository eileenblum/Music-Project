Gotta get away, gotta leave today, I'm gonna leave it all behind
Gotta have a change, gotta rearrange, gonna see what I can find

Better understand, gotta get it while I can, gonna have some fun tonight.
I've done it all before but I still want more, gonna carry on 'til it's light.
And they're always telling me...

You can't do that, you can't do that
I've heard it all before
Yeah right!
You can't do that, you can't do that, a thousand times or more
Yeah right!
You can't do that, you can't do that, I've heard it all before
Ah, you can't do that.

Hanging round the bar never getting very far, gonna let my sorrows drown
Leaning on the wall, 'till I start to fall, gonna get the vodka down

Better understand, gotta get it while I can, gonna have some fun tonight.
I've done it all before but I still want more, gonna carry on til it's light.
And they're always telling me...

You can't do that, you can't do that
I've heard it all before
Yeah right!
You can't do that, you can't do that, a thousand times or more
Yeah right!
You can't do that, you can't do that, I've heard it all before.
Ah...

And don't forget, don't stop out too late again tonight... yeah right...
I'm warning ya... yeah right
And don't drink too much
YEAH RIGHT!!!

You can't do that, you can't do that.
Yeah right!
