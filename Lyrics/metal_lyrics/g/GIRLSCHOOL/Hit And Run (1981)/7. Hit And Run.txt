I was out in the cold
Alone in the night
How could I carry on?
Felt so empty inside

All you gave me were promises
Nothing better than lies
Hit and run [4x]

Told me how it could be
Showed me how to believe
But I just didn't realise
It was all in my dreams

All you gave me were promises
Nothing better than lies
Hit and run [4x]

But I know better now
I've found another way
One thing I know for sure
I'm gonna live for today

Say goodbye to the bad times
Now I'm free on my own

Say goodbye to the bad times
Now I'm free on my own
Hit and run [12x]
