Like a fish out of water
It's plain to see
We'll be put in a picture
It's a pain to be

Out to get you, out to get you
They're coming our way
Out to get you, out to get you

Don't believe what they tell you
It's only a lie
They've only one answer
Live and let die

Out to get you, out to get you
They're coming our way
Out to get you, out to get you

Rock and roll renegades, an anti-bomb brigade
You won't get your answers talking to people in charge
They haven't got the right to make us feel sad
That's all I've got to say, the bomb will drop today

They're taking us over
With no reasons why
But we shouldn't have to fight
Just to stay alive

Out to get you, out to get you
They're coming our way
Out to get you, out to get you
