A lot of people telling you what to do
Kick down the door still I gotta prove to you
I got the safe on my own, but I must get off my pride
You must keep on going to reach the other side
Tell you what I'm going to

Kick down, kick it down, kick it out [2x]

Yesterday always used to be the same
Looking for somebody else to blame
I'll tell you what I'm going to

Kick down, kick it down, kick it out [2x]
