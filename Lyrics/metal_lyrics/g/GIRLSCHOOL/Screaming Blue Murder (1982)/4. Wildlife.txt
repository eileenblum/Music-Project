All the faces with one expression
Behind the windows, we're all down at heel
Don't expect us to do you favours
It's just the way that we feel

Get ready for some action
Get ready wildlife
Get ready it's our reaction
Get ready wildlife

Breaking loose, the only solution
We're getting well outta line
We don't follow, won't swallow
They're gonna find out
We've got our own minds

Get ready for some action
Get ready wildlife
Get ready it's our reaction
Get ready wildlife

Get ready for some action
Get ready wildlife
Get ready it's our reaction
Get ready wildlife

Get ready for some action
Get ready wildlife
Get ready it's our reaction
Get ready wildlife
