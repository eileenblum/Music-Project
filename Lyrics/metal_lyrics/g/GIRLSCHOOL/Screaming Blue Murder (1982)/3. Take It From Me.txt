Waiting in the corner
Sitting with your head in your hands
Looking for a way out
Hiding with your head in the sand
You know it isn't easy
And so you try to run away
But you'd better watch out
You're gonna have to face today

There's a way outta here
I'll make it clear
Take it from me

You know the lines on the mirror
Are showing up on your face
Sooner or later
Someone's gonna take your place

There's a way outta here
I'll make it clear
Take it from me
