I was feeling like nothing on earth 
Bored with everthing 
With lots of wine I could feel fine 
Looking like something that the cat dragged in 
Take a walk down by the Thames 
Throw myself in and have a swim 
Down the Prince Of Wales 
It never fails to bring a smile 

Oh you got everything 
Everything and more 
Oh you got everything 
Oh you got everything 
Everything and more 
Oh you got everything 

And the streets are paved with gold 
So many secrets still untold 
Neon lights are shining bright 
I dance away the night 
Up the junction 
Round the bend 
Will this madness never end 
Crazy people everywhere 
Down in Soho Square 

Oh you got everything 
Everything and more 
Oh you got everything 
Oh you got everything 
Everything and more 
Oh you got everything 

I've seen the desert at sunrise 
Like fire in the skies 
Mountains giant blue and cold 
Rivers running gold 
Tokyo and Amsterdam 
New York, Paris and Milan 
When you come back into view 
Nothing dares compare to you 

Oh you got everything 
Everything and more 
Oh you got everything 
Oh you got everything 
Everything and more 
Oh you got everything 

Oh you got everything 
Oh you got everything 
Oh you got everything 
Oh you got everything
