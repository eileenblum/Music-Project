Mad mad sister's going out to play
Mad mad sister, what did you do today?
Mad mad sister's coming out to play
Mad mad sister, you're gonna show the way

It shouldn't hurt
But it does
Who'll catch you when you fall?
You made me
I made you
Out of nothing at all

Who's gonna catch you when you fall?
Who's gonna catch you when you fall?

Mad mad sister's coming out to play
Mad mad sister you're gonna fade away
I should have known, read the signs
But that was another place, another time

It shouldn't hurt
But it does
Who'll catch you when you fall?
You made me
I made you
Out of nothing at all

Who's gonna catch you when you fall?
Who's gonna catch you when you fall?

Mad mad sister's coming out to play
Mad mad sister, what did you do today?
All your life's spent telling lies
Is that madness i see in your eyes?

It shouldn't hurt
But it does
Who'll catch you when you fall?
You made me
I made you
Out of nothing at all

Who's gonna catch you when you fall?
Who's gonna catch you when you fall?
