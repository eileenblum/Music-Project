Saw a reflection in the blade of a knife
Saw a reflection in the blade of a knife
I saw a knife right in front of my eyes
Saw a reflection in the blade of a knife

Grinning some smile, I'll be here for awhile,
Don't try to stop me, I'm sorry I lied
There's no remorse when the wicked steal
The wicked feed on the innocent

Who saw how could you tempt me?
How could you make this life seem so unreal?
You gave me all of your madness
And in your shadow I will follow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Saw a reflection in the blade of a knife
Saw a reflection in the blade of a knife
I saw a face in the coat of steel
It's the hand that I had to deal

Can't go back 'cause it's gone too far
I saw a face staring back at me
I'm leaving you my wound, my scar
Rearranging your sanity

Who saw how could you tempt me?
How could you make this life seem so unreal?
You turn my days into darkness
And in your shadow I will follow
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Saw a reflection
Saw a reflection
Saw a reflection
In the blade of a knife
And it was you
