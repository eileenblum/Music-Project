All day, all night
All day, all night

This is where it all begins
Give an inch and I'll take everything
Keep it coming 'til the best one wins
Keep on tempting you to sin
I'm not that innocent

Come on over, gonna make your day
When the cat's away the mice will play
Be easy to get what I want
Say the word and then I'll come on strong

All day, all night
All day, all night
All day, all night
All day, all night

Keep it coming, don't keep it to yourself
Keep it coming, don't leave me in this hell

All day, all night
All day, all night

I'm not that innocent
I'm not that innocent

Moving faster than the speed of light
Spinning closer than a satellite
The only way is up, don't bring me down to earth
This could be your lucky night
I'm not that innocent

All day
All night

All day, all night
