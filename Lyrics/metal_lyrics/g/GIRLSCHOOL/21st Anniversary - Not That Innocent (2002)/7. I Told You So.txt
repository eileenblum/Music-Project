You said you love me
Believe me true
My love is not so sweet
Not sweet for you
You said you love me
So full of fire
You want all of me
Well, so do I, yeah

I told you so

It's no good for you,
It's not my crime
And I'm too fast to be
Wasting time
This is just the way
That it shouldn't be
And you can have it all,
But not with me, no

I told you so

I told you so
