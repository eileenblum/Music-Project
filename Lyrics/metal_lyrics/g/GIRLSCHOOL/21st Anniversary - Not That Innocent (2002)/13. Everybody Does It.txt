Everybody does it

If you want it
Go out and get it
If it feels good
Get into bed
If it feels good
Get out and do it
If it feels good
Just get onto it, yeah

If it's out there
And you want it
Go out and get it
Get out and score
If it looks good
It's your desire
It's only happiness
That we're after, after all

Everybody does it
Just get out of the closet

There's a power
Around the corner
There's a fire
In everyone
Don't go it solo
'cause that's no fun
Go out and do it
Just get out and get some

Everybody does it
Just get out of the closet
Everybody does it

Everybody does it, yeah
Everybody does it, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody does it

Everybody does it
Just get out and get some

Everybody does it
