Picture a face with eyes of blue 
The kind you would die to gaze into 
I want you near me, 
I need to feel your hand in mine 
Wondering if we were just a way of killing time, 
Was it just another waste of time? 

Imagine a love without the pain 
I feel so scared to hurt again 
I need to see you, 
I feel so far away from you 
I wouldn't miss you, 
Oh, if we'd only had some time, 
But then I'd know if you 
Were really mine 

If you have a change of heart, 
I won't be the first to fall 
And if you ever change your mind, 
I won't be as blind as love, 
I wouldn't be as blind at all 

And I need to see you, 
If it's to only break the spell 
I'll go on without you, 
Then let me be a little on guard, 
Because I know we took our love too far 

Da da da da...
