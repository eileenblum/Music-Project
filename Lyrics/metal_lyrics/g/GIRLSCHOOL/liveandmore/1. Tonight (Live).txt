Time to get away, forget about today
Let's get out of doors out on the run
Been here too long, nothing going on
Find a place where I can have some fun

I've had enough and now I'm through
There must be better things to do

Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight

Time to get away, finished with today
Make a move and go out with the crowd
Getting insane, wanna stay up late
Find a place where the music's turned up loud, up loud

I've had enough and now I'm through
There must be better things to do (to do, to do)

Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight
Let's go

Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna hit the town tonight
Tonight
I'm gonna run around tonight

Tonight!
