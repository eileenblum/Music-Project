[T. Rex Cover]

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
I move like a rat
Charge like a ram
Sting like a bee
Babe youâre gonna be my man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, youâre my toy
My 20th Century boy

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane
Drive like a car
Ball like a man
Babe youâre gonna be my man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
My 20th Century boy

20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy [x4]

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah I'm your toy
My 20th Century boy
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy [x4]
