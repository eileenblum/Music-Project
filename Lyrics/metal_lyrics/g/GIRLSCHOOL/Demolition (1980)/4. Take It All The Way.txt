One day you're up, next day you're down, 
Nothing you can do but just stay around 
Trying to do your best,hoping they're impressed, 
But can you hurry up 
'cause you wanna know who's next 

Oooo, they're gonna take it all away 

Loved you last night, loved you yesterday 
But you'd better be careful just what you say 
Saved all my money, saving that's a drag 
But I never let them see you when you drive up in your Jag 

Oooo, they're gonna take it all away 

They're gonna 
They're gonna take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 
take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 

[Repeat 2nd verse] 

They're gonna 
They're gonna take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 
take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 

They're gonna 
They're gonna take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 
come for you today, 
They're gonna take it all away, 

You better watch out! 

They're gonna take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away, 
They're gonna take it all away 

Whoo!
