Can't make out things they said
Spent too many nights getting out of my head
They must be mad. must be blind
Driving me crazy right out of my mind

Nine, nine, nine. Emergency, Emergency
Nine, nine, nine. Emergency, Emergency
Nine, nine, nine. Emergency, Emergency
Ni, ni, ni, ni, nine, nine, nine, Emergency, Oh no!

Can't think straight, can't decide
And time's running out 'cause there's nowhere to hide
Where to run, what to do
You better look out 'cause I'm coming for you

Nine, nine, nine. Emergency, Emergency
Nine, nine, nine. Emergency, Emergency
Nine, nine, nine. Emergency, Emergency
Ni, ni, ni, ni, nine, nine, nine, Emergency

Emergency
