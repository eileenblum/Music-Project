If you got my number
Why don't you give us a call
Pick me around
It doesn't matter at all

When I got a phone, yeah
Gotta have an end
I knew you won't tell me just where you've been
You got my number
Why don't you give us a call

It was a midnight, midnight ride
Midnight, midnight ride

Tell me where I stand now
I wanna look for sure
Leave me, tell me lies
I put them all before

You got me waiting for too long
Why won't you tell where I went for
You got my number
Why won't you give us a call

It was a midnight, midnight ride
Midnight, midnight ride

Midnight, midnight ride
Midnight, midnight ride
