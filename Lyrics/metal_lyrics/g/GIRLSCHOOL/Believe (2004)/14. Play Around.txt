You, you shine like gold to me
I feel like IÂ¹m on a voyage of discovery
I'm, I'm dancing on wires I'm flying high
Couldn't get any higher

[Chorus:]
I'm not looking for excuses
I'm looking to believe in you
Some common ground
To make you stay around
Come on let's play around

I, I get so excited I'm totally blinded
By the light in front of me
How do you do what you do to me
I feel like I'm in the middle of a fantasy

[Chorus:]
I'm not looking for excuses
I'm looking to believe in you
Some common ground
To make you stay around
Come on let's play around
