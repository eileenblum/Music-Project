She took the opportunity to stay awhile and live in style
She always did just what she pleased
She said I wanna live a life of ease

And if you go where the rich men go
You'll have it made, with all expenses paid

She lived a life of luxury
And thought that it would come for free
And when it suited she would say
Come over here, I'll make your day

She'd twist them round her finger till
They'd beg for more, then she'd take it away
She said

[Chorus:]
No means no, I always say what I mean
Yes means yes, I always mean what  I say
Yes means yes, yes ,yes, yes,

She took the opportunity
To go where she could still be free
She always did just what she pleased
She said I'm gonna live my life for me

And if you go where you wanna go
You'll have it made, so make your day
She said

No means, no, I always say what I mean
Yes means yes, I always mean what I say

Yes means yes, yes, yes, yes,

She said money to burn
Will keep the wolf from the door
I like the man
Who keeps giving me more

[Chorus:]
No means, no, I always say what I mean
Yes means yes, I always mean what I say
Yes means yes, yes, yes, yes,

And if you go where you wanna go
You'll have it made, so make your day
She said

No means, no, I always say what I mean
Yes means yes, I always mean what I say
Yes means yes, yes, yes, yes,
