Take a look from every angle and you might just find the thrill
Forbidden fruit is always twice as sweet, uh huh
Have a taste for strange adventure and you're waiting for the kill
Come over now and book a ringside seat , uh huh

Don't wait, too long, to find out, you belong
Don't wait, too long, to take a chance and play along

[Chorus:]
C'mon, get it on

I'll take you window shopping just to whet you appetite
So fix your gaze and see just what's in store uh huh
Come over here and get a little taste of what's to come
Feast your eyes and you'll be back for more uh huh .

Don't wait, too long, to find out, you belong
Don't wait, too long, to take a chance and play along

[Chorus:]
C'mon, Get it on
