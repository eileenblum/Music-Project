Could this time, be the last time
No more backward glances it's the end of the line
Next time, would we be so blind
No more second chances, we're running out of time

Gimme, gimme, gimme more
What's it all about, what's it all about

[Chorus:]
Hold on tight hold on tight
Hold on tight don't let it drag you down

This life, what's it all about
One thing leads to another we need to work it out
It's mine to live it how I like
Goodbye to old romances it's the end of the line

Gimme, gimme, gimme more
What's it all about, what's it all about

[Chorus:]
Hold on tight hold on tight
Hold on tight don't let it drag you down
