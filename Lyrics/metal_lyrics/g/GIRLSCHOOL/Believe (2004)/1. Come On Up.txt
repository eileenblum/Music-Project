Well I'm watchin' you
Watchin' me
Watchin'  you, watchin' me
All the things you wanna see
That we're gonna do

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Come right here, you can watch the ball

[Chorus:]
Come on up where the boys are going
Come on up where the girls are showing
Come on in where you'll find the treasure
Come on up where you'll feel the pleasure

Well, I'm watchin' you
Touchin' me
Watchin' you, touchin' me
All the things you wanna feel
That we're gonna do

Big screen, small screen, frame by frame
Come right here, you can watch the game

[Chorus:]
Come on up where the boys are going
Come on up where the girls are showing
Come on in where you'll find the treasure
Come on up where you'll feel the pleasure

Well I'm watchin' you, watching you
Well I'm watchin' you, watching me
Watching you, watching me
All the things you're gonna see
That were gonna do

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Come right here, you can watch the ball

[Chorus:]
Come on up where the boys are going
Come on up where the girls are showing
Come on in where you'll find the treasure
Come on up where you'll feel the pleasure
