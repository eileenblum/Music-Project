I know a secret, a secret about you
I'll try to keep it, this secret about you
I know a secret, a secret about you
I'll try to keep it, this secret about you

But bear in mind I'm the gossiping kind
I think you'll find if I'm wined and dined
My tongue is tied and my eyes are blind
My tongue is tied if I'm wined and dined

I know what you're thinking, thinking about things
I know what you're thinking, thinking about me
I know what you're thinking, thinking about things
I know what you're thinking, thinking about me

But I'll try to find a little peace of mind
If you care to confide I could be on your side
Look me in the eye and swear it's the last time
While I chalk one up for womankind

I know a secret, a secret about you
I'll try to keep it, this secret about you
I know a secret, a secret about you
I'll try to keep it, this secret about you
