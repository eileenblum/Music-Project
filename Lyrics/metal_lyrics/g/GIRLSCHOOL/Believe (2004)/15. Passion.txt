I can't live without passion it shakes me up and drives me on yeah
I need the fire to ignite and turn the darkness into light

I can't live without desire it lights the fuel and takes me higher
It drives me on and through the dark until the fire starts to spark

I can't live without the lightening cause only love is that exciting
I light the flame and hold the torch and feel the burning passion scorch

Have you ever felt the passion burn you to the core
Electric fever in your veins you'll come back for more

I can't live without desire it lights the fuel and takes me higher
It drives me on and through the dark until the fire starts to spark

I can't live without passion it shakes me up and drives me on yeah
I need the fire to ignite and turn the darkness into light

I can't  live without passion
