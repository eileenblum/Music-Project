You say, don't wanna end up all alone
You say, don't wanna end up on your own
Well you'd better think twice before you're not nice
You'd better think twice and take some advice
Cause let me make it clear, you're not wanted here
So won't you go away nicely and just disappear

[Chorus:]
Kiss Kiss
I'll get what I want
So don't try to change me

You say, don't wanna end up on your own
You say, don't wanna end up on the phone
With a one way conversation that's going nowhere
Speaking to somebody who just doesn't care
Trying to talk to someone who just doesn't give a shit
Well I'm telling you darling that this is it

[Chorus:]
Kiss Kiss
I'll get what I want
So don't try to change me

You say, don't wanna end up all alone
You say, don't wanna end up on your own
Well you'd better think twice before you're not nice
You'd better think twice and take some advice
If you reap what you sow, you'd better take it slow
And tread very carefully wherever you go

[Chorus:]
Kiss Kiss
I'll get what I want

So won't you go away and let me get on with my life
