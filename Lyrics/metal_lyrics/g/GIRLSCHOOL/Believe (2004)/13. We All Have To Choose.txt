There's no one here to save you, no hero for the day
There's no one there to hear your screams they'll just fade away

Nobody's listening, nobody cares
There's no one here to help you there's nobody there

Nobody else here's my hand
Nobody else here's my hand

We all have to choose
We all have to choose, someday

Don't think about the future don't worry about today
Don't need no one to help you just wanna slip away

Nobody's  listening  nobody cares
There's no one here to help you there's nobody there

Nobody else here's my hand
Nobody else here's my hand

We all have to choose
We all have to choose, someday
