It's another quiet night but it won't be for long
But we're feeling alright so it can't be wrong
There's a band playing down the road they sound OK
And every day feels like a Saturday

We love to

[Chorus:]
We all love to Rock 'n' Roll
We all love to Rock

Waking up the neighbours waking up the dogs
Walking down the streets singing Motorhead songs
We're feeling pretty good, feeling pretty fine
You can live your life and I'll live mine

We love to

[Chorus:]
We all love to Rock 'n' Roll
We all love to Rock
