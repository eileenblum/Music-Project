Stir up a storm with a shot of adrenalin
Devil may care he said never again
Yes I would if I could but you know that I can't
Yes I know that I should but I know that I shan't

Take me to heaven and take me to hell
To the height of the heights shall I fall, yes I fell
Well who's calling the shots 'cause I know that  I'm stalling
Who's driving the wagon, I'm falling
I'm falling

[Chorus:]
Never say never say never again, no I
Never say never say never again

Stir up a storm with a rush of adrenalin
Devil may care he said see you again
Yes I would if I could but you know that I can't
Yes I know that I should but you know that I shan't

No I

[Chorus:]
Never say never say never again, No I
Never say never say never again

Shall I be taken or shall I be saved
Because I'm  runnin'  round in circles but who's runnin' the show
And you're never alone with a shot in your hand
Well it's good bye for now because I've gotta go

[Chorus:]
Never say never say never again, No I
Never say never say never again
