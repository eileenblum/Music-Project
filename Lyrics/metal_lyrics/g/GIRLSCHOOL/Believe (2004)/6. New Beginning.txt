This is a new beginning, this is another way
This is a new beginning, this is another day

I believe you can do anything if you try
I believe you can do anything if you try

There is a new sun rising, this is the last goodbye
Two past times gone forever, we've made it to the other side

This is a new beginning, this is another way
This is a new beginning, this is another day

I believe you can do anything if you try
I believe you can do anything if you try

Feel it coming, feel it coming
See it coming, feel it coming today

This is a new beginning, it's time to take control
It's time for new horizons, stand up and take it all
