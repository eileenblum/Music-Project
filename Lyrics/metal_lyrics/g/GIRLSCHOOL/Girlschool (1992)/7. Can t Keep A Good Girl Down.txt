Lean clean mean
My pleasure machine
My jaguar
Câmon letâs make it obscene
I need some bad behaviour
Skin touching skin
Looks like Iâm lost in love
And trouble again
So câmon get ready

Are you ready for love
âCos you canât keep a good girl down

Engines roar
Hear them growl
Big black panthers
Out on the prowl
So câmon now to my back seat of leather
Weâre gonna make it
Shake it up together

So câmon get readyâ¦
