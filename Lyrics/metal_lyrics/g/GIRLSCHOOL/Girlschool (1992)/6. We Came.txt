A rebel angel sits on my shoulder
Telling me of a vision in mind
Garden of Eden of lost pleasures
The original sin of mankind

Of love and danger of human nature
Of inhibitions gone astray

A life of passion the main attraction
A gift of the gods should be turned away

We came, we saw and grew stronger
We came, we saw and grew stronger

Words of power and dedication
With these things weâll all go far
A little magic, a love potion
âCos every mansâ woman is a star

We came, we saw and grew stronger
We came, we saw and grew stronger

A star gazer, a dream maker
Wonât let it slip thru my fingers this time
My one ambition, my one and only
Donât wanna be told where to draw the line
