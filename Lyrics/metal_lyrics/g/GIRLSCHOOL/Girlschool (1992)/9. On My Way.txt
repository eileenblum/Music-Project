One last drink and then itâs time to go home
Thereâs no stopping âtill the end of the road
No time for conversation, no time for dropping in,
My feet are facing forward,
This time Iâm gonna win.

Iâm on my way; Iâm coming home;
I said I would
Iâm on my way; itâs our last chance
Letâs make it good

I wonât stop until the end is in sight,
Keep on moving right into the night
I want a piece of action, I want my slice of pie,
Iâm gonna make it happen,
This time the stakes are high.

Iâm on my way; Iâm coming home;
I said I would
Iâm on my way; itâs our last chance
Letâs make it good

This oneâs for ever â not for the meantime
I wonât say never, when I can say yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeahâ¦ take it all the way
