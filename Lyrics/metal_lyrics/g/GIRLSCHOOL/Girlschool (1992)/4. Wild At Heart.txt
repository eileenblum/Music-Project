I feel betrayed by greed, by your vanity
Donât want to kneel in your temple of insanity
Watch their beauty as theyâre running free
Out of mind â out of sight

You wear their coats as if itâs your own right
Ignorance is no way to survive
We all belong to the animal nation
Open your eyes to the situation

All of my dreams, you tore them apart
Ripped at the seams, wild at heart

Youâre out of touch with the times that we live
You want to take it all, youâve got nothing to give
You wear the skins but it wonât be true
What makes you think theyâll look better on you

All of my dreams, you tore them apart
Ripped at the seams, wild at heart

Just think of the money as you roll the dice
If you play to win youâve got to pay the price
Too late the hero, the bringer of life
âcos with the earth we will live
and the earth we will die
