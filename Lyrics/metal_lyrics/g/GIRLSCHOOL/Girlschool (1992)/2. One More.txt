Non stop chaos and dirty tricks
Itâs front page news the way you get your fix
Never say no always say yes
âCos nothing exceeds like excess

You can have it all
Catch me when I fall

One more one more letâs even the score
You said before never gonna stop
âtill you get some more

Good times high times taking a ride
All dressed up with nowhere to hide
Itâs now or never canât wait forever
Breaking on through to the other side

You can have it all
Catch me when I fall

Feed me another shot of poison
Feed me another dirty line
Communication breakdown
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
