Sitting pretty and Iâm out to win
Not waiting by the telephone
No doubt about it
I was doing alright without it
Until you came along

Understand
My game plan
Take my time
Now youâre mine

If you only knew
What Iâve got in store for you
I know it would make you smile
Now that Iâve found it
Donât wanna do without it
So say youâll stay a while

Understand
My game plan
Take my time
Now youâre mine

My prince of thieves
My tower of power
We can do anything
Anytime any hour
I wanna dance with the wolves
In a summer nights dream
In a ceremony
We can do everything
