Always looking for something new
Take my chances Iâve got nothing to lose
So take my hand Iâm the one to blame
âCos Iâve just found a new way to misbehave

Take me Iâm yours

So come on over and break the ice
Just let yourself go, Iâll be twice as nice
Lifeâs a game it takes two
Iâll get over every inch of you

Take me Iâm yours

Donât you know thatâs what friends are for
Scratch my back and Iâll scratch yours
Donât waste time playing hide and seek
Cos youâre a bad influence on me
