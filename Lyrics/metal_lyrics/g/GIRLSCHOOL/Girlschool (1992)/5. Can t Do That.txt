Everybodyâs got something to hide
But I can read your mind, youâre not on our side
Changing lies into fact
But one day soon youâll be caught in the act

Caught in the act
Itâs a matter of fact, oh yeah !
âCos oh no, no â you canât do that

Tick tock I was watching the clock
Canât eat, canât sleep, itâs just got to stop
You talk so loud but I smell a rat
And I canât wait âtill youâre caught in the act

Caught in the act
Itâs a matter of fact, oh yeah !
âCos oh no, no â you canât do that
