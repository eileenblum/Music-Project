Light up my heart â set me on fire,
You are the one â my one desire,
I used to think â I had the key,
Love was fine â but not for me.
The minute I set eyes on you
I knew I had to make you mine.
Youâre gonna see my way of things
In just a little time.

âCos Iâve got everything â all you want and more,
Iâve got everything
Youâre my ambition â come with me
âCos youâre my ambition â come with me.

Iâd like to be your angel cake
But I could never be that sweet,
So let me set your soul aflame
Satisfaction guaranteed.

âCos Iâve got everything â all you want and more,
Iâve got everything
Youâre my ambition â come with me
âCos youâre my ambition â come with me.
