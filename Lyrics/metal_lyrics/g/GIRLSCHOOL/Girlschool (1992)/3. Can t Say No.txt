I want to watch
I want to see
Me touching you
You touching me

My eyes are open
My legs they shake
Iâm so afraid of
The love we will make

Your body sweat
Shines on my lips
Feel the need in
My fingertips

Canât say no
Canât say no

Skin on skin
Your tongue on mine
The deepest kiss
Weâre two of a kind

A magic spell
Iâll weave on you
Feel the heat
I feel it too

Canât say no
Canât say no

I want a bit
I want my slice
My piece of cake
Iâll take whatâs mine
