Rotten in my skin
sickness in my mind
I asking you
you don't die today?

Damaged face
Without mandible
Putrid arms
A lost case

That you are lacking parts
Like to your associates
East is an old world
Full of carrion rot

You should eat, human meat
It is the best of the best

Rich and precarious leg
Full worms of death
You should use scalpels
To open everything
