Turn off the body
Grave is broken
Night with the shadows
Feast is beginning

Worms and the purulence are everywhere
My scalpel and I began the show
We celebrated the day of the death
With a solitary silence grave

Suffer meat
Horror shit
Muscle stiff

Fetid scent of dying..... with the pain
Putrid carrion old..... with the pain

Violence, purulence, acid, glue

Ocular acid glue
Clever cream eat

Turn off the body
Grave is broken
Night with the shadows
Feast is beginning
