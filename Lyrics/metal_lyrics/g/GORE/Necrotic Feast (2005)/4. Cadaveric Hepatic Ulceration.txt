Cadaveric hepatic ulceration

Open your eyes to the cadaveric ulceration
And deformed meat, destroyed skin

Open your eyes to the simply putrefaction
And smell the pus and the rotten gore

Blood is on my hands and never I clean
Silence is in my mind and sickness I think

On this mortal wasted and stiff my head
And smell the puss and the rotten gore

Rotten, Tissue, Bowels, Beauty

Into cavities. I scrape one hole
Singles parts of bodies what I can erase.... fear
Body parts and measting fungus, I take all in my plate
Fetid scent in all the wall what I can erase.... fear

Vomit.... fear....
Bloody.... see... ahhh...
