Worm, incrustated in the skin
Removing to the skingraft
And it grappling in the flesh
Intracellular substances
Takes the place in instances
Old germs in the pus
Posmortal cytoplasm
With circulating in the flesh

Pulsations, infections
Grotesque, dissections

All be there on the slap, apparition
Primary infection, propagation

Purulence, putrid meat, all is death
