The foetus silent screams
Sobers the tenour
The pleasure in his brain
The smell of his ritual
Mucous purulent
Insatiable intent
Effects of virus
On embryonic development
Endopsymbiotic infection
Carrion state suppuration
Persists inapparent
Equilibrium between
Lesogeny activated
When the cells started
Adding new virus infections
Uncontrolled proliferation of humans
The foetal disease process
Development has began...
Disbury with contaminated corpse
Cryptic mutants
Your mind rot
Your pleasure, bizarre
Sexual butcher insatiable
Premature necrofoetisexism
