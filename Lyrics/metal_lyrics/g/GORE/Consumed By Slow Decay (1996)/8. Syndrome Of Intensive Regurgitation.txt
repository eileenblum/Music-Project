Suffocation...
Your oesophagus implodes
In a forced vomit
With violent spasms and septic
Pierces engulfs your throat
Intestinal disorder spew up
Your decaying guts
Osteoporus vomit
Blocked in your respiration
In your asphixiated thorax
A mixture of phlegm and putrid offal
You cannot stop regurgutating
Your stentching enzymes
Dislocated traquea, coughing up
Your fetid gastric juices
Bile, chyme, phlegm, mucus and guts
