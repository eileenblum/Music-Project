I open your casket, I stab your corpse
I cum your fingers, incinerated carbon
I reek the stench fumes of rot ebolution
I'm a incendiary and I like this charred fleshfeast
Your greasy fta's on grill, fried to the bone
My brutality is your symbolic death
I char your dehidrates corpse
The beautiful colours of human pyre
Your inferno beyond the grave
Moltem your tissue... fat's on fire
Human inferno... stoked pyre
Fusing the bodies...fried with hate
Organic carbon...smoked and blackened
Inzymes evaporating, to fertilize my mind
The mortification incites me
Giving way to a cataleptic suffering
Look at me, I'm your incendiary nightmare
Expurge your sins on my barbecue grill
