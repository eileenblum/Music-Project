Cirrhosis, organic infection
I fell, I'm infected
By the high alcoholic tenor
That corrodes my infected organism
Intestinal pestilence
Never will be cured to me
Vomiting stimulates
More ande more my pleasure for alcoholic drink
My liver is going to fuck up someday
I want to vomit, I want to break free
