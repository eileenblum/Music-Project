Intoxicating your lung
A respiratory insufficiency
A green putrefied mass blocks
Your oesophagus and traquea
Cicle of suffocation
You go to die
Premature death
Intoxicated
Suffocated screams by stifle
Your phlegm was closed
Suffocation and asphyxia
Interrupted circulation
Accumulated toxic gases
Into your lungs
As I dischange you
Expurgate... phlegm, mucus and die...
Cicle of suffocation
You go to die
Premature death
Intoxicate
