Duodenal extraction with pain
The pacient alive without drain
Sthomacal geisers in rash
The bubbles with faecal pencents
Phlatulence...
Faecal disarticulation
Suction catheter is on
Osteoporus faecalis is on
Pyogenic germs proliferation
In the Haemathological circulation
Phalatulence...
Faecal constipation...
Spasmodic convulsion suffering
Of internal septic haemorrage
Cataleptic decay enter coffin
Faecal disturbance post-mortem
