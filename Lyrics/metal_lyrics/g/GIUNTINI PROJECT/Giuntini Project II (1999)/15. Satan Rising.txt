Thereâs no love in a promise that you canât keep,
Thereâs no dream canât be broken in your sleep,

No road too long that canât be run,
If you chase the moon you wonât find the sun.

And I could never change your mind,
You are dying, for your time is done.

When the Devil comes for you,
There will be no warning just out of the blue,
He will stand before you, and he may smile,
And then you will know itâs the end of your time,
Feel the earth move beneath your feet, thatâs Satan rising,
Nothing burns like the flames of Hell, when youâre dying.

You gotta live your life for today,
Cause it aint worth crying over things that Iâve been,
No road too long that aint been run,
When you chase the moon you wonât find the sun.

You will never change the lies,
Though you keep trying, now your time is done.

Feel the earth move beneath your feet thatâs Satan rising,
Nothing burns like the flames of Hell, when youâre dying.

Out of the blue, When the Devil comes for you,
There will be no warning, just out of the blue,
What can I do, He will stand before you and he may smile,
And then you will know itâs the end of your time,
Satan rising, Feel the earth move beneath your feet thatâs Satan rising,
Time for dying, Nothing burns like the flames of Hell when youâre dying.

Satan rising, When the Devil comes for you,
There will be no warning just out of the blue,
What can I do, He will stand before you and he may smile,
And then you will know itâs the end of your time.
Satan rising, Feel the earth move beneath your feet thatâs Satan rising.
Time for Dying, Nothing burns like the flames of Hell When youâre dying.

Satanâs rising.
