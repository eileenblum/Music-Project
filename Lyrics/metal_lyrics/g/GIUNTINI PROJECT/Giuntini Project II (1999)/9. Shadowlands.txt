Let yourself get lost within the shadowlands
Find yourself a shelter from the rain
Some dont make it out from in the shadowlands
Never known a world in so much pain

Through the cold and empty streets
Full of broken glass
Where your heart will miss a beat
It happened so fast

Here among the fires we talk of loneliness
Thatâs colder than the frozen winters kiss

Just a sleepless night away, from a strangers touch
In a world that everyday, can hurt you so much

so why is everybody looking away
from the shadowlands
thereâs only heartache in the shadowlands
is there no way out

Demolition rocks the ground beneath our feet
Tearing up the only life we know

No one hears you when you cry
No one dries the tears
Still the world has lived a lie
For so many years

So why is everybody looking away
From the shadowlands
thereâs only heartache in the shadowlands
no second chance

shadowlands
shadowlands

[Giuntini/Bowyer]
