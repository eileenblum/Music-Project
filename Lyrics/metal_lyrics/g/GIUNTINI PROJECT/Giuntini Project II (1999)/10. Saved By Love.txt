On the street thereâs a shadow, of a broken man
Thereâs a child and a baby,with outstretched hands
You need no lights to guide you
Just the light of your heart
Thereâs years of hurt inside us
And fear for a world thats falling apart

Praying , we search these open skies
The world cries on
Heaven seems further from our eyes
Itâs been too long

when the rain is falling
hold me close, donât want you to see me cry
I hear your heartbeat calling
Saved by love
Safe in your arms to-night

Going through the motions, never touching ground
In the past we see our reflection,
Cry a tear for a world that we never found.

And somewhere, abandoned children die
The world cries on
Oh, why are we forever asking why
Itâs been too long

[Giuntini/Bowyer]
