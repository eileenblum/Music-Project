It's been a long night, looking for an answer,
I was a fool, searching for freedom,
Think I've been dealing, with the Devil's disciple,
Now I don't know, what's fact or fiction.

I don't know what's going on

[Chorus]
Well I'm not superstitious,
But there's something that bothers me,
It's getting serious,
I think she's got a hold on me,

I can't sleep for thinking about her,
The world's so cold, now that's it's over.

I don't know what's going on

Well I'm not superstitious,
but there's something that bothers me,
It's getting serious,
I think she's got a hold on me.

[Giuntini/Martin]
