The darkness that surrounds us, will soon turn into light,
The spirits that may greet us, will guide us through the night.

Waiting in the wings, disciples of the times,
Waiting on your every single word,
You know they will turn, turn, turn,
The memories they will burn, burn, burn.

[Chorus]
Resurrection day, it's the day when your soul fights back,
Resurrection day, it's the day when there's no turning back.

Stand up to the nightmare, crucify your doubt,
Open up your eyes and lead the way,
Then we will turn, turn, turn,
The memories we'll burn, burn, burn.

[Chorus 2x]

[Giuntini/Martin]
