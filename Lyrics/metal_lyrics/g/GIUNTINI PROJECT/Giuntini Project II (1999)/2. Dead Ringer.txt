Midnight rising, and falling out of the sky,
Blind man crying, colours are running dry,
Fire water, burning from inside,
Cry's of laughter, coming up from the ground.

Worlds gone crazy, hanging on by a thread,
Liberated, from the seven deadly sins,
Tranquil eyes are, searching for a sign,
Waiting for the final veil to fall.

Look, see, the time is ever near.

[Chorus]
When you hear the sirens sing, sweet deceiver,
The state of grace is at an end, it's a dead ringer.

Rediscover, the spirit inside your soul,
Lust and anger, emotions that make you cold,
Misbehaver, rotten to the core,
You can't make it better, if there's no God anymore.

Look, see, the time is ever near.

Symptoms of the human race,
Are dreams that we all try to chase,
We ask the reason why,
We can't just let it die.

When you hear the sirens sing, sweet deceiver,
The state of grace is at an end, it's a dead ringer.

[Giuntini/Martin]
