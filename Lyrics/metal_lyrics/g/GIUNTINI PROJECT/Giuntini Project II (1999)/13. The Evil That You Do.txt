You sigh, because you canât believe that youâre still living.
You cry, and sure enough the tears are really falling.

Why can I see your face, why torment me in this way.

You tried to cover up the things that you once did.
You lied, but after all thatâs all you ever did.

Why keep the pain alive? Lies burned into your mind.

Youâre so extreme, you feel no shame,
it took so long to see the truth.
My life and soul, you crushed hem all,
With the evil that you do.

Youâll die, and all that went before you will be waiting.
And I wonât be satisfied until youâre screming.

Why keep the pain alive, why torment me in this way?

Youâre so extreme, you feel no shame,
You slowly choked the love inside.
My life and soul, you crushed them all.
You turn the truth into a lie.
The chill of fear, means you are near.
Itâs the evil that you do.
Oh, Itâs Evil.

[Giuntini/Martin]
