There is no greater power, the futureâs yours and mine
Another man-made wilderness, across the final line
Weâre giving truth no quarter, and who cares what they say
It seems to be a fair exchange, tomorrow for today

Once more we play with fire
Once more the damage done
The futureâs burning like the sun

Reactor, reactor,
What have we done,
Reactor

We hear the future crying, why do we not reply
We see our children dying, under a red atomic sky

Too late for turning back now, too late to count the cost
Too late the race, already lost

Reactor, reactor,
What have we done, reactor
Itâs not the way itâs meant to be
Reactor

A real life science fiction, weâve put aside our fears
But buried deep beneath our feet, it lasts a thousand year

Once more we play with fire
Once more the damage done
The futureâs burning like the sun

Reactor, reactor,
What have we done, reactor
Itâs not the way itâs meant to be
Reactor

[Giuntini/Bowyer]
