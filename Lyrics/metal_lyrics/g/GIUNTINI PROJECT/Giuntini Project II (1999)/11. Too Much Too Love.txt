Too much, too late, no good, itâs all over,
So long, goodbye, donât wait now,
Thatâs me, Iâm gone, no more, I donât want her,
Sheâs bad, too bad, I loved her so.

She cries, I scream, we fight a real bruiser,
She bites, I bleed, canât stand it,
Thatâs me, Iâm gone, no more, I donât want her,
Sheâs bad, too bad, I loved her so.

I know the sweetness of her touch,
Seen the Evil in her eyes,
Her love hurts much too much,
Too much too late.

I stay, sheâs cool, but soon it starts over,
I go, she gets, kiss crazy,
Thatâs me, Iâm gone, no more, I donât want her,
Sheâs bad, too bad, I loved her so.

[Chorus]

Too much, too late, no good, itâs all over,
So long, goodbye, donât wait now,
Thatâs me, Iâm gone, no more, I donât want her,
Sheâs bad, too bad, I loved her so.

[Chorus]

[Giuntini/Martin]
