Just when you had no hope, thought you were going mad
You felt the time is right just that the karma's bad
And an impersonal world in which you must be strong
It isn't pleasure it's possession, no excitement when the thrill is gone

We've just begun to fight it, right on
Got to start resisting, 'for we wind up in hell
The very reason to resist, so right on

You're on your own, you lock yourself up, throw away the key
Then you're whipped into a frenzy, down upon your knees
You show your animal instinct only to survive
You realize that in a sick way, it's apparent that you're still alive

He've just begun to fight it, right on
Got to start resisting, 'for we wind up in hell
The very reason to resist, so right on

They stop at nothing, thrive on submission
Ya got me down, ya got me down on the floor
It's all or nothing, resist submission
Can't feed the fire, can't feed the fire no more

When the pleasure ends and the thrill is gone
Is when you ask your God for mercy, were you right or wrong
So when the devil comes to take away your soul
Is when you find you're just a number and there's nothing left for you to hold

Weâve just begun to fight it, right on
Got to start resisting,'for we wind up in hell
The very reason to resist, so right on

They stop at nothing, thrive on submission
Ya got me down, ya got me down on the floor
It's all or nothing, resist submission
Can't feed the fire, can't feed the.fire no more
