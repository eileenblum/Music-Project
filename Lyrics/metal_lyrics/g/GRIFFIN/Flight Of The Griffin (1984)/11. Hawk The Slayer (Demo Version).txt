To my God, hear me now, give me strength to be brave
Through the heat and the smoke, there's but little to save
The fires raged on throughout the night, and now through the day
Many deaths have been tolled, now the price must be paid

Assemble at once, tonight we ride

Horses gaining as torches flame through the
Black night, riders have come to destroy
It's the last frontier, it's a night of fear
Brave riders will fall prey, they answer the call this day
Don't stop crossing burning bridges past the night watch
Lead the quest for independence
Hawk has come to claim his vengeance
Men have tried, many men have died
To oppose the dark one, your life's in your hands
You had best beware, you must be prepared
Together we break through, there's no time to lose
He must stand, we must protect the land
The mighty hawk must not be stopped
He wields his sword cast by his lord
The fog is creeping in, the battle must begin, we fight
