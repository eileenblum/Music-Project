Ascends to the earth in the form, and the spirit as one
Created the sovereign protector, his kingdom has come

Among the stars in the sky, there's magic in the air
A kingdom of fire, destroyers everywhere
By light of the moon, a golden figure stands
A symbol of God, a conqueror of man

Spreads his wings from out of the sun, a king of all kings
The cross that he bears, the road that he holds, his storyâs been told

He peers from above, through misty morning fog
The moment is right, it shouldn't take too long
Down from the sky, in search of precious stone
Will not be denied what he admires most

Stacks his prey, his presence is felt, his power so great
He lives by the cross, possesses magic claws, his reign lingers on and on

Rose from the ashes, successor to the throne
Place of his origin isn't known
He seems to exist, been seen in nanny forms
The winged beast appears and then he goes
Where, no one knows, to seek out the treasure of his soul
