Does anybody know about where we've come
Been wreaking havoc, never chose to run
Deploring utter cries for what we've done
When metal rules the world we'll stand as one

The final word will come on Judgement Day
Don't he surprised, you've all been warned, make no mistake
Judgement will be done, we stand together, all for one

They've tried to stop us, tooth and nail we fought
Still try to smear our name, we cant be bought
The very reason that we linger on
Dur metal forces gather, growing strong

The final word will come on Judgement Day
Don't be surprised, you've all been warned, make no mistake
Judgement will be done, we stand together, all for one
