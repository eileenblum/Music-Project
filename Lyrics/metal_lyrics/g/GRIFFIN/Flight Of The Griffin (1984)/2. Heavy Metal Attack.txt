Crusaders set forth from the castle
So graciously march to the sea
Prepared for a blood thirsty battle
The warships set sail dreams of victory
New fighting from the inside, cruel love for vengeance will prevail

By night fall the castle's surrounded
The roadhouse and moat are ablaze
The order is given, advance to the wall
Pursue till the victory is gained
New fighting from the inside, cruel love for vengeance will prevail
Never abandon their conquest in life, courageously sworn to their faith

Heavy metal attack, fighting hand to hand on the field of glory
Heavy metal attack, to the death they will fight and endure the pain
Heavy metal attack, hear the sound of the steel clash with passion and fury
Heavy metal attack, those who live by the sword also die by the blade

By daybreak the castle has fallen
The smouldering ruin remains
Cries of the wounded are heard across the land
They cry for their God to be saved
New fighting from the inside, cruel love for vengeance will prevail
Never abandon their conquest in life, courageously sworn to their faith

Heavy metal attack, fighting hand to hand on the field of glory
Heavy metal attack, to the death they will fight and endure the pain
Heavy metal attack, hear the sound of the steel clash with passion and fury
Heavy metal attack, those who live by the sword also die by the blade
Heavy metal attack, lingers on greets the dawn with the slaughter of thousands
Heavy metal attack, to their God and the king was their life what they gave
