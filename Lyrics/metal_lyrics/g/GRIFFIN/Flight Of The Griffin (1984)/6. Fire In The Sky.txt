Has anybody even stopped to wonder
Where the future lies
Running from the devil, always poisoning my mind
Ride a train to nowhere, could be running out of time

Letâs put a to all the madness, living just to die
The grand illusion, World war III
It need be no surprise
The dogs of war they have no conscious
Fill us full of lies
There ainât no use in talking, they donât care to realize
Be melting into nothingness like right before our eyes

[CHORUS:]
Nowhere to run, the time bombâs ticking
Nowhere to run, donât wanna die
No place to hide, be no escaping
Canât fight the fire in the sky
Traveling past the speed of light, super sonic blast
People falling all around to the ground
Theyâre falling much to fast
Itâs much to late, you canât escape, too late to be saved
You realize youâre about to die, itâs a breath away
