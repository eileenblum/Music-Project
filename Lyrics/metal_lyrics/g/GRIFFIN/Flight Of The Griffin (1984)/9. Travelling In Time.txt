Ever get the feeling when you know you're lost right from the moment
Feels like you're lost in time, something inside your mind has taken over
Someone's got your number, thought you heard a voice, your name was spoken
You felt the past speak, you know not what you seek, it's really nowhere
Traveling in time out on the astral plane, perpetual motion
Had time to catch a cloud, could only hear my heartbeat, I was nowhere to be found

How could you ever really see a certain likeness, could it be
You're looking up, you're somewhere on the ground
You feel a force of nature calling
All at once you feel you're falling
A place where restless spirits can be found

Travelling in time to places so far away
Travelling in time out on the astral plane

A crime of passion, are you still dreaming
In your eyes I see you're scheming
Your magnetism that follows and devours
A forceful will that's so disruptive
Penetrating and seductive
Can not be broke by any earthly power

Travelling in time to places so far away
Travelling in time out on the astral plane

It calls, a voice in the wind
So strange, the feeling begins
You feel overcome and now you submit
Your desire is raging within

Can't feed the fire, can't feed the.fire no more
