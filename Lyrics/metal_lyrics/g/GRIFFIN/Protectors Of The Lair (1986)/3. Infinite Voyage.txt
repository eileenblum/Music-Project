Disrupting both space and time
Theory suggests
Of regions that lie beyond
Vanishing point
Where magnetic pull is strong

Transmitted from outer space
Source is unknown

Something is there
No evidence has been found
Still it exist
And operates quite unsound

Edge of space
The edge of time, time, time, time
Black holes like a vacuum
Sucking the universe

Super dense stars
Exploding with violent rage
Space bending time
Distorted and inter changed
Down to the core
Extracting cosmic debris
Pressure releases
Into a darkened sea

High concentration
Host like diversion looms
Critical mass
Now destined to be consumed
Gravity cycles
Nothing left to emit
Vacuums created black hole
Bottomless pit

Edge of space
The edge of time, time, time, time
Black holes like a vacuum
Sucking the universe

Event horizon threshold time is erased
Can't be detected
Light it cannot escape
Beyond this point
Matter ceases to exist
Into the void
Strange gases and swirling mist

Edge of forever
Destiny must unfold
Boundless dimension
Into the vast remote
Infinite voyage
Grand drama will evolve
Parallel worlds ascending
Through endless falls

Edge of space
The edge of time, time, time, time
Black holes like a vacuum
Sucking the universe
Edge of space
The edge of time, time, time, time
Black holes like a vacuum
Sucking the universe
