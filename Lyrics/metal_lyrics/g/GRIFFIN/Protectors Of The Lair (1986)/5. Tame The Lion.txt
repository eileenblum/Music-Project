Lives inside a castle
Somewhere hidden in the clouds
High up in the mountains
You can hear the cries
Hear the cries
Laughs and sings the moon is glowing
Radiant red light
Unleashing powers of pleasure in the night

Believe it, what is strong
His so majestic his song
Believe it, oh you will see
Can't tame the lion
The griffin is king

Emerald eyes and wide spread opinions

Believe it, what is strong
His so majestic his song
Believe it, oh you will see
Can't tame the lion
The griffin is king
