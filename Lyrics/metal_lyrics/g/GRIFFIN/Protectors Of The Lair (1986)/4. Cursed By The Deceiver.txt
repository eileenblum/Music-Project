Again it's got you tonight
It's cool to tell yourself alright
You're feeling so great
You're feeling strong
Then all of a sudden something's wrong
You panic you've been there before
You're desperate
You know that you must score
The tyrant has got you by the balls
The rush that you had is gone

Cursed the deceiver before it's too late
We denounce non believers
Cursed the deceiver before it's too late
Something's wrong

Cry out god help me before it's too late
Or you die, go to hell
They'll be no one to blame but yourself

Cursed the deceiver before it's too late
We denounce non believers
Cursed the deceiver before it's too late
Something's wrong

Cry out god help me before it's too late
Or you die, go to hell
They'll be no one to blame but yourself

It's become soul destroying
Remains are the shell of a soul
The pain that's within you
There's no escape, can't let go
Torment and torture
You've brought on yourself
You control and those you take with you descend
To the depths far below

Cursed the deceiver before it's too late
We denounce non believers
Cursed the deceiver before it's too late
Something's wrong

Cry out god help me before it's too late
Or you die, go to hell
They'll be no one to blame but yourself
