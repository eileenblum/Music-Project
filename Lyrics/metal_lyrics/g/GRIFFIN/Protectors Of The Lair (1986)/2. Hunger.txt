Here we go again

Waken strange one lonely evening
Find you're all alone
You sit in silence
Feeling from inside your body
Growing deep inside you
Now you rise

Find a book you've never seen
A book in which you start to read
It's at this point you
Become enhanced instantly
Found the book of shadows
Enter the vampire queen's eternal life

Carnal forces overwhelm
Tremble at her sight with raw emotion
Especially now you've heard the song
Been beckoned by her
Bathed in lambent light
Impelled by longing deep desire
She summons you with force and fire
You can't resist, too late
You find you cross the border line
Time has come, she senses what is hers
Vampire queen awaits new life

She'll give you the promise of life
This is the final command
The vampire queen now demands
You obey her, her final command
A burning desire
The hunger grows wild

Fulfill her need, succumb to her
She'll give you life
She wants your blood

Hungers now been satisfied
Willful captive to her
Can't be broken
Controls the minds and bodies of her victims
And lovers which she feeds

Now acquired a fetish for the deadly vampires kiss
Bound and chained enslaved forever
To the vampire queen you serve for life
Fulfilling her need
It's your blood that she seeks

She'll give you the promise of life
This is the final command
The vampire queen now demands
You obey her, her final command
A burning desire
The hunger grows wild
This is the final command
The vampire queen now demands
You obey her, her final command
A burning desire
The hunger grows wild
