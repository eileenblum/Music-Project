Could they be watching
Watching from the sky
Long distance travelers
Are believed to coincide
Endless enigma
Though the truth was lost
Still question why
Still this existence
It remains a mystery to this day

Among the ruins the answer lies
Within the sacred sight
Magnetic power fields appear to signify
Solar alignments come together
Through both space and time
Ancient observers
Long ago they founded their domain

Watchers of the sky did they exist
Celestial voyages through outer space
Watchers of the sky, the mystery
The mystery of the cosmic truth on earth

Could they exist

Could they be up there
Watching from the sky
Extra terrestrials
Some day they may arrive
So let the truth be known
To all of interstellar light
If life is out there
It remains a mystery to this day

Watchers of the sky did they exist
Celestial voyages through outer space
Watchers of the sky, the mystery
The mystery of the cosmic truth on earth

Could they exist
