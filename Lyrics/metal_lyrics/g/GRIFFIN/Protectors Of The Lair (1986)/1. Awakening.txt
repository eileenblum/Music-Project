Here lies the body of the Polish king
May we remember him
Not for what he did
But for what he didn't do
And the people who stood by him
For which he gave his life
May God bless him
And may he rest in peace

Where am I?
What is this place?
What is the thing that draws me?
Who are you?
Show yourself
I said show yourself
Oh no, oh no please don't
Not me
