Defy laws of decay
Reversed passage, remain t'ellurian
Holy rites of preservation

The flesh has left the body
Initiated in the grand ossuary
To renew in greater majesty

For a soul is to redeem
Unchained for momento mori

Initiated in the grand ossuary

Spared by the worms of fate
denied, no return to dust

Robes of piety adorn
Surgite mortui
Venerated morbidity, blaspheme the redeemer
With human remains

Close the gates of time
Open those of eternity
