Assuming posture of Shavasana
Through a narrow gateway of infinity
A thousand eyes of Vairocana
Shall watch my ascent
Transfigured stars rest in each nexus
Sacred letters surround walls

Face of the faceless ones
Form of the formless one

The everlasting wheel is unveiled
Eternity's voyage is unleashed
A once ordained passage
The entrance of oblivion
Where inanimate convalesce
A thousand eyes watch the ascent

Face of the faceless ones
Form of the formless one

Rest the Gods with no centre
All pervasive bearers of the third eye
Beckon me to join the ranks of the dead

The light of Mahakala
Call of the faceless one
The force of omnipotence
The light of Mahakala

Return to the corpse
Sounds pierce
The lower waters of purification
The levitation is complete
We must die - be born anew
Hear this utterance - one of rebirth

Beckoning me to join the ranks of the dead
I can see the light of Mahakala
I am drawn nearer,nearer

The light of Mahakala
Call of the faceless one
The force of omnipotence
The light of Mahakala

The light of death
