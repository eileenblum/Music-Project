Disintegrate my anatomy with divine breath
Initiate within an endless hall
I am there

Mystic light of the dead
Lead us towards dissolution
Hidden chant of a voice
For your utterance bears no source

For it's brighter than a thousand stars
Flowing from the pores of luminosity
Carried by the flight of transference
Adorn with ecstatic reveries

The Yacquis term it dreaming
For Tibetans, the stages of Bardo
Therein lies the portal
Of our altered existence
For emisseral projections
Emisseral projections

I am detached from the body
I am no longer but flesh
