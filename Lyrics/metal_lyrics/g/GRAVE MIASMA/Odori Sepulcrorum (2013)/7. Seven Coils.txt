Limitless sense of doom
Reincarnates with undulating pulsations of gnosis
Pierced with tongues of fiery revelation
The breath separates layers of life's narrow gate

Unfettered from earthly bounds
The veil of Eleusinian mystery is lifted
This is the night of nights, where worlds colide
And where incense shall rise
Expose us to the cosmic winds
Incandescent suns will surface
In the hearts of our void's emanation

The flesh is surrendered in 
Without skin, beyond marrow and bone
Renounced will
The laws of another devour
The flesh is surrendered in
The laws of another devour

Unravelled, the essence is clear
Affirmation of lore turned spirit
Unravelled,the essence is clear

Renounced will
The laws of another devour

The serpent shall straighten down the middle pillar
The spine shall coil through the second layer
The serpent shall straighten down the middle pillar
The spine shall coil through the second layer

Shells of skin unravel to the abode of
I have strayed into the all prevailing waters
Deeper than deep, where the rule of foreign gods is manifold
And primordial formations divided the laws of our re-birth
Unravelled in seven coils

Raise a voice within 
Forfeit to Adya
My body is a vessel to speak through
They comprise of seven coils
The found reflection

Machinations lay bare

The revelation is opague
Through none shall dissipate
From chaos spawns belief
