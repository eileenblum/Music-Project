Suspended in the hanging dimension
Vitality beyond comprehension
Projections further, further beyond the void
Penetrated nature behind visions

Paradoxical existence less physical form
Abandonment of the flesh
Elevates realms of turbulent illumination
Commit the shell to fade

Sacrament of the expanse
Of shadows and rays
Omniscient radiance heeds the light of the end

Awakening from the slumber of mortality
To dissonances of the intermediate state
Surrender to magnitude of impermanence
Hark the exaltation of loss

Freedom from the world of matter
Alienation from the past
Euphoria turning to anguish
Sorrow eclipse elation

Î­ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï 
In the mouth of perpetual light
Î­ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï 

Inhale the rotten stench

In the mouth of perpetual light
Claustrophobic fumes of spiritual degradation
Mists darken
Towards the joyless plane
I transmigrate
