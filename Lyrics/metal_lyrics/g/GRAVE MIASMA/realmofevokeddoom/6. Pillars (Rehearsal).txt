Like constellations encircling in a void 
As of desert sands 
Emanate formations of balance 

The veil of Parokheth is cast asunder 
For the chasm is channeled 
Within the place of the skull 
Upheld by pillars 

Matter's mysteries dictate regeneration 
Flesh traverse caveats 
Fiery paths of the womb's treasures 
Morphing ceaselessly 

Jaws of severity 
Transmute to the averse son 
Invocation to supernal man 
Beauty in Laceration 
Flayed flesh adorned 
Assigned blood stains the ground 

Sewing the seeds of the fall 
Accursed son of decay 

The Sphere of the Sun 
Illuminates Tiphareth 
Cthonic ones arise from desolation 
Transfiriation by the presence of Charon 
Leading the transcendent path to aberration 

Spiritualization of suffering 
Arise... Influx of emanations 
Arise... The sixth path 
Manifest... As above, so below 

View spiralling circles 
Of highest power 
Cross the Abyss 

Meditate upon 
A stone of black fire 
Regenerate, ascend the Pillars, 
Cross the Abyss
