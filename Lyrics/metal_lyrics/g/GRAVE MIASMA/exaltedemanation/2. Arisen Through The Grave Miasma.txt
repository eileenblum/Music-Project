Veils of phospherate matter arise
In offering from Vayu to death
Or shattered bones manifest
In dedication to unearthly waters
Burning red ashen yellow
Cascade over adorned atavism

In deepest slumber realms will be reached
Reading a secret frozen in vales beyond
Channelling separate kingdoms
Through sullen black hollows

Substance embedded
Dwellers in Decay

Resplendent body torn and born
Smoke of blackest fires commence
Mehazael arisen within
The Grave Miasma

Fell the astral stench
Reanimation in unity
Mehazael arisen within
The Grave Miasma

Worthy of the whitest crown

Veils of phospherate matter arise
Uncovering corpse remains
Pointing in four orientations
Serpentine aperes of the flame

Phospherate rays, alight the depraved passageway
Gleaming in spiritual disease

Resting in the depths of their creation
Portal to the outer world of gods
The womb of earth is open

Flowing in a current of eternal putrefaction
Filling every conclave

Worthy of the whitest crown
Devouring with deifying caresses of majestic decay
Miasma
