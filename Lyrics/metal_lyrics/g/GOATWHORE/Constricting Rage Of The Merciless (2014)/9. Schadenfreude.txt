The feeling of these cold hands wrapped around the heart 
Shattered pride sinking into dark

This evocation of torment spreads
Hope will meet hopeless in this journey to the end

I am the cold poison of despair
I am the hollow feeling of fear
Within these walls of your secret flaws
I will seek what makes you fail

This spoiled salvation fed to the hunger of apathy

I am the bitter taste of failing love
I am the loneliness of demise
Crawl across burning coals of strife
I am sever the spirit of your pride

You will now crawl before me and worship all that I displace

I am the burning of virgin flesh
I am the crippling of sight
As you fall deeper under this spell
I will conquer your imperfect life

Once I've sown this negative theme
I will savor the ruin of all your dreams

Pushed from this edge of defeat
Fall into a heartless realms of this deceit
I am the shadow you will embrace
I am the blood of innocence defiled 
Taking your life is my desire
I am the burning hatred of this fire

I am inversion of your praise
I am the darkness that consumes your heart
Kneel before this life of punishment
I will tear your soul apart

When your righteous sky fell, you eagerly followed me into this hell
