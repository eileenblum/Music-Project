This Touch Of A Losting Life Awaits An Impeity Of Pain
A Life Taken Into Its Own Hands Falls On Countless Journies

Can You Feel The Fallen Ages?
This Timeless Slumber From Cold
These Frail Fingers To Untouch A Life... This New Mold
At Long Lasting Emptiness In Sunken Warmth
Fused Into One Being For All Eternity

Tasting A Bitter Delight For This Last Transgression Of Praise
The Winds Are Blown From An Opposite Plane To Conjure The Eternal Flame

As I Drown In The Poisoned River
Breathing A Last Breath In Escape
Visualize A Lost Approach To The Beginning Of A New Man
This Kiss Of The Accursed On Virgin Lips
The Dirty Angel Of All Utmost Sympathy, Praised

Smouldering In Forgotten

A Cursed Stone Throne At Those Awaiting This Judgement
View And Isolate Its Unwanted Display Of Power

Swallowing These Sin Submerged Cities With Oceans Of Fire
To Escape In Legend Will Be Unforgiven By All Of Man

Engravings Of A Sunken Race To Return To Land
Uncovered City Beneath The Sands
Mighty Fortresses Covering The Plains Of Crossroads
A Smell Of Screams Burn Through The Air
Grains Of Salt Covering These Grains Of Sand
Sharp Were The Thorns Of This False Kings Fall

As I Stand Upon The Mountain
Staring Into The Blackness
Seize Of Darkness
Seize Of Hatred
Seize Of Evil
I Fear Not For My Life
For I Am One With Death
A Passage Through Sorrow To Taste Winters Breath

All The False Images That Lead The Youth To Damnation
These Lost Years Have Been Written By An Ancient Divine Will
Misfortunes Of The World A Trait To Be Engulfed With Sin
Holding The Hands Of Unvirtue
Entwined Blackness Burns A Creation To Ash
An Ungodliness That Devours Itself, Whole

Manifest This Chaos Of The Arts
Terror In The Minds Eye
A Sick Sea Where Brothers Slay Brothers
Stare Within This Fortold Divine Decree
9-15
