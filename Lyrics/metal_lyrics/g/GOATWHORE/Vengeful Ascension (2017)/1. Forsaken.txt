Essence of repugnant evil
Casting these lives into torment
Implement of the unholy
Abhorrent portal of life

Engorge in this sacred flesh
Bloodstained sight of revelation
Abolish this repentance of sin
Birth of the omega

Bellowing fires arise
Blacking out the skies
Revealing the heartless
Bloodshed of righteous design

Honor the rites of massacre
Extinction of this passion
Purging all that is holy
Boundless murdering desire

Save fires arise
Burning into the skies
Filling the lungs of the heavens
In a strangling breath

Carving the praise of Lucifer
Into these hearts of fear
Manifesting demons of these vile acts
Burn the praise of Lucifer
Into consecrated flesh
This immolation rite in the Inferno's thrall

Twirling winds will devour
Demons will feed on desires
Tidal waters will drown
Cleanse the earth of doctrine
Invoke the promise of ruin
Vile deeds of the repulsive
Rabid acts of slaughter
Unsettling sight of destruction

Brand the praise of Lucifer
Upon the faces of God
Conjure the demons of this desecration
Slice the praise of Lucifer
Into the wrists of this sacrifice
This deed will be the vessel of oblivion

Execration prevails
Lost to all that is evil
Murdering the essence of light
Reveal the heart of this darkness
