Destitute in this depraved existence
Expose the true horror of mankind

Eliminate the burden of resistance
Unlocking atrocities of the mind
Imminent extinction
Celebrated with these mournful screams
Rampaged horizons
Blood filled oceans of assault
Inhaling harsh filth
From the seared flesh of revolt

Hammer of reprisal welcomes death with open arms
Summoning the praise of this blood-soaked lust
Trance of deliverance, feed the need for this domination
Prepare to unleash these foul demons of war

Unhealed sufferance harnesses the urge
For infernal bloodshed
Awakening dark domains
Savage warfare
From conflict

Fire storms engulfing all that stands
Reckless force guides the hand of man

Resurface the frantic outcomes of self annihilation
Impressions that stain forever,
an image that numbs this sanity

Desires of triumph
The essence of cruelty
Seared flesh fades
Bone shrines of eternity

Storms of steel, emotionless attacks
Heartless acts unveiled in war torn violence

Indulge in this primitive urge,
passions overcome with hatred
Consumed by these starved warmongers of dispassion
Absolution for death, haunting battlefields
For the harvest
Bow before this throne of carnage

Wake of this lifeless cold,
paves the path of demise

Screams of vanquished defeat,
fading into chaos
