Golden prophecy spilling with sorrow
Serpent of fire consumes this promise

Sleeping violence in oceans of unknown
Bring forth a storm of fear eroding the pride in man

Subdued to the fatal inner human fate
Bitterness of sense on this throne of menace

Temptation invoked in the garden of lust
Fire of spite matures, hymns of returning doom

Eye of the colossus, bleeding tears of sin
Matriarch of demon seed, birth the dark within

Feral reason etched into calm thought
Replace the presence of this devotion

Spiraling inside the belly of the beast,
Coiled towers of swarm
Blasphemy is whispered in the unrest beneath
Awaken the chaos in this voiceless curse

Graven image
Ruin of all
Blinding vision
Writhe in flame

Unearthly flesh, once concealed in thought
Breaking the surface of humanity
Crumbling cathedrals against a splintered sky
Clawing the flesh in this reckless surge

Masked with scourge, unleash this violent hell
Silence the stars, crushing eternal realms

Removing the face of this adoration
Isolation pours into innocent confines
