Storm within the all seeing eye
Foreseen revelation of this tempest

Pulling towards this dreadful nightmare
Desperate sounds escape through clenched teeth
Invoking the troubled senses to a horrific gaze
Poisoned conviction in filth covered promises

The great path of life,
plagued in desperation

Sanctified flame that
Consumes rampant desire

Liberation marred by
The anguish of reprisal

Decayed hands reaching
From the earth
To the skies

Reaching upward to
Pull the sun
From it's throne

The mouth of Hell
Deceit of this illusion

Surging venom in primordial hunger
Unforgiving like the wolf pack
To the lamb

Anointed in the rebirth of ageless bond
Devoted like the darkness to the night

Illusive word of divine
Deceptive sacrament descends

False remorse of this
Obedient devotion

Passionate belief resonates
With collapse

Cleansing the universe
Of reverent worship

A crown of despair rests on
The skull of decayed man

Prevailing reign of death
