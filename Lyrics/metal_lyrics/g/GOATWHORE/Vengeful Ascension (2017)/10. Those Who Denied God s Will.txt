Resistance calls for war
Against this rapture

Legions gather in force,
Potent from this rage

Raise the lawless order beyond the stars of God
Judgement of God's will with this fall of shame

Opening the earth for this feast of condemned
Bestowed penance of agony with no end
Forging scars where wings were once adorned
Tumbling revolt to an underworld with no dawn

Prestige devoured inside this conquering eclipse
Origin of flame within this vast abyss

Gnawing hatred kindles this thriving hunger
Desperate resent appears,
spawning the damned

Echoes of defeat assemble to proclaim conviction
Far beneath where the sun is silent
Winds whisper in vengeful tongue
While the counsels of wrath
Denounce this end

Reflective stage in this inner void of light
Unraveling hatred gained from this disgrace
Spiraling revenge penetrates this silence
Rising scourge, a godless domain is born

Revolt is cried under the soot of looming skies
Surface from this blaze of retribution

Born from shame inside this painful exile
Darkness crept from the
Resolve of collapse
