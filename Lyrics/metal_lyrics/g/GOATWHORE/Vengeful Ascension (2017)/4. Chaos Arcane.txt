Chaotic void
An ancient force
Bestowed with cruelty
Spreading this malice

Stillness of midnight, the silence crawls
Looming clouds, like the ravenâs wings

Chaos arcane, from the abyss i shall be born
Chaotic reign, bathed in blood i shall destroy

Infectious anger
Spreading panic
Strife of the damned
Conquers resolve

Your promise has fallen, rapture of charred praise
Foreshadowed faith, the aftermath of despair

Chaos arcane, from the abyss i shall be born
Chaotic reign, bathed in blood i shall destroy

Contagious weakness
These souls of man
Victims of worship
Mislead redemption
Abandoned order
Eroded sentient
All hope has gone
Catastrophe reigns

Absolute ruin, of all thatâs profound, overcome with fright, dissolving pride
Nourishing the hate, residing in fear, tearing away worth, existence ends

I am the messenger
Demonic bearer of this madness
Harbinger of desperation
Defiant to this will of god

Banished from scriptures to be forgotten
Crowned in the blessings of apocalypse

I am this chaos
The crawling fear strangling the spine
Architect of all misery
Emptiness of failed belief

Absolute ruin, of all thatâs profound, overcome with fright, dissolving pride
Nourishing the hate, residing in fear, tearing away worth, existence ends

Moral confines
Shattered defeat
Numbing bitterness
Grasp of death
Haunting outcome
Resides in man
Darkest instinct
Risen from the godless
