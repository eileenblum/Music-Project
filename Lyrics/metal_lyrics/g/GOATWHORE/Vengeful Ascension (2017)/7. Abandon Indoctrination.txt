Exposing the lie
Of doctrine
Awake the potent truth

Portal to awareness,
Thundering asunder,
Hidden from the mortal eye

Desire guides us towards these darker paths
Temptation of the unknown void that compels
Resentment of this vision in purist ideals
Unlock the god fearing secrets of this hell

Morality falls into burden of untimely ruin
Plunging deeper inside this consuming void

Conspiracy of penance inducing this aversion
Canticle moans drip from tongues of persecution

Cold essence awaits
Distorted values of divine
Mortal born conceit
An inversion of mankind

Kneel before reality
The end has carved it's name
Upon this hallowed rite
Submit to all that is damned

Torn from promised salvation
The bleeding womb of betrayal

Expelling sermons of plague like curse
Locusts swarm in harmony of this annihilation

Unleash the fire that burns in the heart of man
Archaic sense that awakens this savage truth
