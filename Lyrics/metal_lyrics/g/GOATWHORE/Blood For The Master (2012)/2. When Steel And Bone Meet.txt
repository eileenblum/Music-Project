In vengeance the darkness will spread, as these great wings engulf the sun
Birthing this black across golden skies, heavens will burn and the earth will die

Emptied of guidance and hope, burning the wishes for peace
Rising hatred from this false light, terror will be heard across the lands

Procession by virtue of war, blood stained hands
This fall of creation

Sound this requiem as we ascend, unholy battle until the end
Burning hatred for the end of gods, crawling praise has come to the end of times

Crush the pious icon of delusion to silence the followers of light
A war machine of this damned cause, take no prisoners without a fight

Forever in darkness we shall dwell
No forgiveness for all that have died

Reign of inversion upon the skies
Feasting on blood from the divine
Smashed skulls lie beneath our feet
When steel and bone meet
This war on god has just begun
Conquest of freedom will be won
Never turn our backs in retreat
When steel and bone meet

Warn the king of the holy, the time has come, this war will be won
And this death shall be the domain for the followers of the crucified one

It's death or victory in our hearts with dead bodies at our feet
Superior forms of bloodshed, lead the way for this deceit

The final breath of defiance, a battle to the death
Raise the flag of the damned

Reign of inversion upon the skies
Feasting on blood from the divine
Tearing flesh with razor teeth
When steel and bone meet

This war on god has just begun
Conquest of freedom will be won
Never bow our heads in defeat
When steel and bone meet
