Frigid souls that can never feel again
Harvesting the dark magic in decay
Falling deeper into this trance of flame
Feeding from this now withered self worth

Dwelling within this worship of demise
This communion of transfer is complete

Passion stirs in waves of assault
Scraping elements from the sound mind

Return these false gods, to realms of disease
Transfixed on the rotting, harvest of the ascending soul

The fall of dominions, extinction of man
Ascend in this blaze, that engulfs the tyrant
The spirit of twilight, reclaim this dark power
Digest the archetype, in this verse of hate

This abhorrent manner, filthy rite of outrage
A trembling coldness, the collapse of reason

Mount the wings of death
Wield the scythe of this ancient craft
Poison heavens in the blackest flame
Rise forth from this decay

Whispered words from these deadly lips
Secured to the pain from this abyss
Untouched by mortal glare
The throne in the void beyond despair

Bound in serpents coil
A final breath beneath this bitter soil
Fractured hands of time
These frozen moments of a sick design

Spoiled with ageless blood
Destroy the kingdoms on the throne above
Rising legion of the damned
Bring forth the slaughter of the holy lamb

Open my wrists
Transcendence
A superb death

A vile custom
of perdition
Adorned in this task

The soul of sacrifice, blood for the master
This age of oblivion, a lifeless endeavor

Frigid souls that can never feel again
Harvesting the dark magic in decay
Falling deeper into this trance of flame
