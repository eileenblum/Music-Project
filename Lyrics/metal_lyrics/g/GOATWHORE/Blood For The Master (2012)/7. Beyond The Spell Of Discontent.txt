Erratic behavior prolonged in the grip of eternal unrest
Defiant in the accounts of betrayal with hateful guidance

Winds from the abyss have whispers of ruin in their revolve
Enter this wake of reality inside the confines of the beast

The irritable demigods of these endless borders
A forming darkness is waiting to swallow all the stars

Scared ideas that will latch to the dead for answers unknown
Entrance to this stolen soul for the hidden most hated desires

The implosion of fading gods have caused this curse
Screams from a dying nebula will contest to these truths
A deathlike quiet pours into the ears of the mindless
So selfish to think any of your gods would escape the emptiness of this... Colossus

Now the holy names are forgotten and the thunder moans my death
From far beneath the earth, the fires are burning bright

Abandon idols in decay, corroded prayer of concern
Stop the stances of belief, accepting all things to end

An anguish deserved by many, an anguish absorbed by one
With blood we feed the master, like a long trail into darkness
The ghosts of the past keep pushing my fall
To awake the mourning into onyx dawn

An afterlife of delirium, in the middle of the immense and the dead gods
Dismember this umbilical attachment to this secure existence

These massive stone foundations of devotion to the dead
Gravestones for man's failure to cope with the fear of the life beyond

This apparent link of flesh and blood
An art of destroying, forever breaking will
Another version of the epic flood
This time we are all damned with no survivors
