Vain presence rejoiced, procreate the skill of deception
Enter the shell of flesh, cast from the soil of the cursed
Immoral rise, exiled to the dark heart of this maze
Praise this blood, wield the knife of the slain

Despair if they fail
Feeding on their own
Holding on to past desire

Great lord of death, the framework of this reverence
Morbid appeal, descend into unnatural realms
Glorify the sick, forged by this imperfect touch
Sons of hell, praise the order of chaos

Stripped of these wings
On a column of fire
Hollowed of this hope

Tomb of black, prison of this fate
Rotting soul, engorge in unrest
Altered state, emerge as the snake
Drowning teeth, into bloodied flesh

This revenge, on the breath of hungry wolves
Death awaits, entrance into the vault of heaven
This pouring hatred, from the wrist of god's dream
Burning madness, pandemonium breaks free

Witching hour always strikes
Feel the bite of cold emotion
Self absorbed isolation

Grinding fangs, dripping with deceit
Urge to kill, tragedy of life
Wrath and rage, anger will consume
Bound by fire, enter into hell
