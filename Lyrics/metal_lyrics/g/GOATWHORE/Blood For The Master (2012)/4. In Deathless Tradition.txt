Unresolved essence in a tomb of fates
Obscured by beliefs of this divine rank

You beg and crawl for forgiveness, for an answer to salvation after death
Silent prayers to the riddle of purpose, the shepherd of deceit leads into darkness
Treachery has these masses enslaved, the perfect unison in a tarnished faith
Blindly enter this portal of passing, raped desire in a promise of this undying

Forgiveness is the failure of your faith, this deed brings the death of the human race
Seek this message in a structure of allegiance, these hidden secrets suffocate the truth
Praise the promised words that seem timeless, stepping off a precipice into disaster
Failed dispute of this longing regret, another shallow attempt of life after death

Consuming this hope of dreams, a gathering of ill-fated souls
Escaping the hands of judgement, an urge to be saved

Chained in snakes awaiting this hunger of the underworld
Drawn down from stellar ideals into the bloodline of curse

Dark times have begun, the existence of failing faiths
Becoming the end of awareness, sealed in this tomb of lies
Embrace the collapse of rapture, dull wishes fall from grace
Failure of this transformation, evolve into the untruth of pain

These warning trumpets have sounded
Devour the dying life force of this faith
Unite in descent towards this mouth of hell
Dreadful entry into the prison of this death
