From the great hand of holocaust

Great winds expose the structures of an emptied core
Hollowed thoughts of this vision, this existence turned inside out
Impassive vessel of confined hatred

Deviated catalyst that will reconstruct
The embedded image of the damned, after all is gone

Behold the secret to annihilate
Wormholes fading into regions of death
Unexplained disease that will flood the misfortune of might
Rebirth in this apex of collapse
Defiled idols fall in the ages of decay
Expanding force that consumes, destroying all positive intent

Force of this tragic stride, hell's unforgiving arms
Vortex of merciless decay, untouched by any theory
Suicides form the heavens, sink into the eye of terror
A mound of bodies lie in wrath, reaching the hereafter

Reflection of self denied, the demon that eats the soul
Sunken eyes of fear, a path of forgotten pain
The lifeblood of treason, tasting this bitter steel
Sacrament of disaster, wounds that never heal

This venom of revenge, the Judas of black skies
Untouched by divine means, as this earth slowly dies
Machine of destruction, Satan's unholy ways
Burning fire of inquisition, a demise of this grace

An art of sacrosanct lust, this rite of virgin's blood
Disguised by confusion, summoning of the demon legion
The kindred of this ruin, awaiting the fall of this order
Diminish into madness of complete death, this sufficient hunger
