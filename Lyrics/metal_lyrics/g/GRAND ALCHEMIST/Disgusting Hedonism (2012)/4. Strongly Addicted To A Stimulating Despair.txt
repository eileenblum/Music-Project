Begin for more. I try so damn hard to hold on this brilliance
Because this is for real... and my confusion is my tong

Strange, as a strange fade in this absurd ocean
Once again, it strikes as eternal experiences to the senses

I can't taste the colors right
Strongly addicted to...
Be my face below
A stimulating despair...

Begin for more. I try so damn hard to hold on this brilliance
Because this is for real... and my confusion is my tongue...

Pain, don't drain, are you thinking about me when I'm swimming my way?
Fade away, when I kiss her till death and see a designed eternity

I can't taste the colors right
Strongly addicted to...
Be my face below
A stimulating despair...

Turning away and see another day gone by... feels like zero
Mistreated all my life... by myself.... not by you

How should I value my fear when I'm staring into emptiness
And realize that the answers do not rely on the wall?

Affection, searching, finding, touching, fucking, smiling, dying
Everybody think they're going somewhere
Affection, searching, finding, touching, fucking, dying, smiling.
To believe in an everlasting fear

A fucking manufactured ignorance?!
