Burn me!
Like a dance in the fire
Striking my eyes, my loss and my fears
A dance in the fire
Discerning my dreams from my waking thoughts... boosted

Burn me!
Like a dance in the fire
Striking my eyes, my loss and my fears
Envisioned and now for real
Discerning my dreams from my waking thoughts... I live underground

Vision how the poison is to be swallowed and how I choose this kind of life
Don't take purity of mind for granted
People don't know anything and don't talk about nothing
The centre of my soul

I've opened up and I've closed it down
Cold-sweating... breeding under water... virus incubation

Burn me!
Like a dance in the fire
Striking my eyes, my loss and my fears
A dance in the fire
Discerning my dreams from my waking thoughts... boosted

Burn me!
Like a dance in the fire
Striking my eyes, my loss and my fears
Envisioned and now for real
Discerning my dreams from my waking thoughts... I live underground

Raising chaos
The forces of Leviathan
