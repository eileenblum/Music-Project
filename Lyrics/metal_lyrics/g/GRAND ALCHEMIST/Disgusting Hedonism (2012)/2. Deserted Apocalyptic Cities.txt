The thought of never coming back is what leads me to attack
Steering at the flogging depths of pandemonium
My blood begins to boil, heart beats faster than before
I am guided by forces beyond my control

There is no heaven, there is no earth
Introspective dimensions

Heading into a visionary vortex
In a tormented moment of hallucinations
And I begin to realise that this is no dream
Another illusion is turning real, once more

Abandon and return
Are you the night, and is my ship sinking faster than I could know?
Like marches of death within a frantic oblivion of human avalanches
I approach these deserted apocalyptic cities

It all becomes one
And I will never be left alone to weep

Sucked into blackness, consume me more and more.
The perfect symmetry of my mind and my body

Phantoms, ugly faces as I whirl
In a tormented moment of hallucinations
And I begin to realise that this is no dream
I am loosing the grip on the reality's might and the affection for life.
