Lost in a mirror of shame, steering at yourself and wondering who to blame?
What a waste
I got pain in my veins today, you have many faces!

Abused and fused apart, shining

Somehow I know this pain is for real
Since I first met you and since we went apart
I've exceeded the bounds of decent life; every day feels the same
Bizarre and self-destructed ways, don't deny yourself
These are dreams that affect my behaviour

Somehow I know this pain is for real
Since I first met you and since we went apart
Exceeded the bounds of decent life; I try to see it all
To reinforce the impression of reality and insanity
and seeing pain as the only link between them both

Rage broke the mirror of shame leaving no-one behind to blame
I got pain in my veins today, you have many faces!

Abused and fused apart, shining

One taste, one bite, a longing for more
The moments of conquest
A perfect symmetry of my mind and my body
It all becomes one

Guided by forces beyond my control (I slip into oblivion)
No remorse for the infected sinners swimming in this wormhole
Obsessed on the thoughts of destroying my body to overcome boredom...

I saw, a shame that is not a part of my game in life, and under the dawn, endless darkness
I saw a brilliant dissonance
