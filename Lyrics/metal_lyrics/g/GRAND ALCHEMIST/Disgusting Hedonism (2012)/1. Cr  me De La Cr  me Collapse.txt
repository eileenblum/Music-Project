I can see something else, rather than my soiled and destructed illusions
And by thus perceiving the sounds of ten million weepers of loss

I will keep you in my heart as a symbol of grace when I bum my wings
And my feelings turn into disgust
Blindfolded I see myself as one on both sides

Kneel down and get hypnotized by this distinctive cadence of speech confining you
He wants you to feed him, wants you to bleed for him
Yeah, he's just like a parasite, fucks things up on the inside and then makes you wither away
Creating the black dog that licks the bottom dry

Eating dirt on demand.
I want you to feel and see what inhabit my specific skin
Eating dirt on demand.
Losing myself as one, then wither away

Is this an illusion, or just a confusion, but it feels so fucking real?
Would I ever be pure and clean and feel you embracing me?
No, dementia is nearby

Eating dirt on demand.
It feels like I am diving with stones around my ankles
Eating dirt on demand.
Chasing the dog and the dog is me
The fucking dog is me!

What kind of turn will my mind make and will I ever be able to stand as one again?
I've been driving down this dirty road for so long and so close to a self-denial joy

Paint on my body symbols and words that will describe my weird demise
And that I wasn't able to subsist my life until The End.
