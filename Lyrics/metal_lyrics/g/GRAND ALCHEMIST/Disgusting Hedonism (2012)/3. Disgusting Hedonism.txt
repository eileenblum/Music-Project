Scraping my finger-nails into this dirty mass of what seems to be my floor
Running away is just the metaphor of dying
I could push this further beyond, twist the knife more
Predisposed and attached to passion as I am

Life: One rise, just to fall.

Yes, I am digging deeper and deeper.
I am needles and don't sense the hands that strikes me.
Yes, I am digging.

Are you happy, swimming towards nothing...?
Sometimes it feeds me too... ahh... disgust!
This fucking nature eats me up and invites me deeper into
a generated hostility against all man-kinds

Life: One rise, just to fall.

Yes, I am digging deeper and deeper
Now I will fry (to feel even more)
Yes, I am burning to sense life

A head to head combat

An illusion has kept it away for so long
Just whip!
No more water for me please.
Just whip!
Give birth to freedom.
We will never meet again...
