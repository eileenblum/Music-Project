No shame and no reclaim
No good and no bad in this life,
No feelings at all in this fucked up Prozac mind.
I feel no fucking numb and I don't sense anything.

No lament echoes,
I wash my hands with both eyes closed and try to degenerate
the rapid and chaotic impulses (that fed me before).

No moderations and no temptations
In the bounds of this shit-case

A boy, wearing dead flowers in his hands
Affected by the beauty of his infection
Reaching for a level beyond his dark shell
A touch of transcended mentally delays.

No pain and no pleasure has lain
It's hands over me this time
I feel so fucking numb and I don't sense anything.

No lament echoes,
I wash my hands with both eyes closed and try to degenerate
the rapid and chaotic impulses (that fed me before).
