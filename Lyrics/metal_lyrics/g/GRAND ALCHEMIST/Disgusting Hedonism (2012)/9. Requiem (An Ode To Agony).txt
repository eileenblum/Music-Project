Has it ever occurred to you that I want to drown???
To swallow it all?

Possessed
I am longing for torture and not for the segments of grace

Forever deceased by conventional shame and transparency
Envision the pleasure and pain, sorrow and solitude

This is darkness as I see it
So black that it's unreal!

Possessed
I am longing for torture and not for the segments of grace

This is darkness as I see it

Come and dance with me, I saw your face and you sailed away
Alone with my thoughts, I am giving you everything

Holding on long enough until it breeds within me
I will last for how long it takes to see it all
Who are you, whom I chase?

I fucked my life up for you as a distinguishing expression of lust
An intense focus upon different levels of reality
