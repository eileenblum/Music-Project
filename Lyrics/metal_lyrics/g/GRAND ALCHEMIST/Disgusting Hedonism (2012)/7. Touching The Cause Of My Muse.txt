I'm touching the cause of my muse, the voices in my head
Strong and stable, never pending or pretending their shed

Eye - the visual insanity
I tried to see but they nailed my eyes

A scream of silence (I scream in silence)
In ambivalence, I will question neither my will nor my desire

I'm touching the cause of my muse, the voices in my head
Feeding them is for me to staying so alive

Dreams - the forced duality.
Forever trapped in this dream-scenario 

It straps me.
My hands are tied
A mental penetration 

I'm drowning in my own madness 

I see a sick and closely controlled transaction, in the essence of my basic instincts
No taste of color, but the smell of black leather trespasses the conception of man and virtue
I salute the sinner 

Under water I try to establish my contests for a difference in actions.
