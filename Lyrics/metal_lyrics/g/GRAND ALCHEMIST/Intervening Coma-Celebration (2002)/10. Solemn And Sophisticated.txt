Drink up boy, have fun
Disregarding if you run
Incoming temptation
The art of creation

Solemn and sophisticated
My soul flies away before I die
Solemn and sophisticated
Have found my diabolical eye

Solemn and sophisticated
Illusive work to deny
Solemn and sophisticated
Have opened my real eye

I don't know the taste of your heart
If you can't do it yourself,
just walk away from me

"I took the life from your friend last night
And then fell in love with you
Just call me a fool
(would you stand on your feet?)
It is not always the right thing
to be good?"
A Fusion of illusions and facing truth

Considering the air is sealing
Considering that I breed in mud
The intensive pulse of knowing
That tonight is the night.....
