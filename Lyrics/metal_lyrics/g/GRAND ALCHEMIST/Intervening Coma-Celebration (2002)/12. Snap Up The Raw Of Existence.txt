Consistent sense
Spinning serenity
A sombre fortune
My soul is foreign to my body...

Snap up the time
Snap up the raw of existence
I reach for the depth
A grip down to the agony field

Until my treasury opens
I cannot see
What's deep inside of me
I'm bound to the secrets of the alchemy

Snap up the time
Snap up the raw of existence
To know I'm alive
To know I'll feel death tomorrow

Pride flows around today
Like a denial of what I saw yesterday
Though I will not change my direction....
