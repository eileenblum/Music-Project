I open the shell tonight,
A grand spiritually ceremony

I feel the adrenalin pumping
like a metaphor of a goodbye
When I stand against
this mode of expression

I feel the adrenalin pumping
like a metaphor of a goodbye
When I stand against
this mode of expression
And I feel the pressure of
this final touch of the surface
I stop the compression
of my dynamic field

I open the shell tonight
and I'm not coming back.

I stop the compression
of my dynamic field,
like a grand spiritually ceremony
in my life.
