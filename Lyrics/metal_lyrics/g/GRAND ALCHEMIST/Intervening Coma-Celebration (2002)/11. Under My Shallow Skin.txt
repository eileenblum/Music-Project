Times are changing, confusion to define
Haunting scars and tokens through my line
We did never actually meet
and now it's too late
I am cold and can no longer entertain
those who don't care

Dreams to conserve the virtual reality
I reach for the level above the (puny) naivety
I saw them like a bunch of slaves
In the depth they are all fakes

In chains my body is bound
I am and you can't change the fact that,
She I love is not she I care for...

I am waiting and waiting and dreaming
But I can't imagine what the dwell is for
Consecrate to the outstanding misery
I fuck the black flaunting leather whore

The touch of this knife makes me wonder....
The say life is so cruel
I guess they're just afraid
to open their minds
and see what's inside?
