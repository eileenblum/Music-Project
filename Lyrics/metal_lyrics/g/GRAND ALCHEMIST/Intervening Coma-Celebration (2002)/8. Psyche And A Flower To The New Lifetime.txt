Solution
Dignity has no face
Collusion
I am, fallen from grace

Time is my tragedy or victory
All deserted in pride
In existence cloud my delight
My somber emblem and the agony field

"As depression pierces my heart,
my end is here
I climb the mountain high,
because shear-drop calls there"

I feel no fucking guilt
Look at the temple I have built
Prudence falls, but I was never here

Last breath upon the ledge
Goodbye and fuck you
I did never regard the edge
I fly away without wings...
