I consider my extremely and deep desperation
As a beneficent mode of expression
No answers just a incurable
and intense longing
There is no way out
I am forever trapped in this vacuum

Breeding through a flaunting vagina
And feel the sombre emblems of darkness
There is no way out
But don't hold on to me
And don't consider me as your friend

I am forever trapped in this vacuum
But at least I burn
In the implacable fire

Abuse me
Accompanying inscriptions of
what may come into existence,
when all terminations fuse together
Take a bite and feel it too

Incurable longing
A passion feeding mental chaos
