Sucking all the negative atmosphere
and floating together like water
I can stay right here and see
the light saps it's strength

I'll always be there
and resting in chaos

Bleeding for the energy that's apppear
when the pain reaches my mind
Would you smile to me?

I'll always be there, and regarding
the beautiful reflection
in my depression

Time, generated as a fundamentally
and dramatic confusion and desperation
don't point your finger
which you can't define!!!

I'll always be there
Everlasting and resting in chaos
In a mourning and peaceful day

To touch the profusion of death
and at the same moment swim
in a haze of compressing truth
is a striking example of a new contrast

I'll always be there
Everlasting and resting in chaos
