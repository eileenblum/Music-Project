Follow the farewell
Like I did once before down the main fall
And under this blinking candle
I saw their so-called life

The pretender and his belief
To disappear is my relief

Follow the farewell
Like I did once before down the main fall
I am leaving without you
And fade the moments of affection

From the visions of reality
and down to insanity
I confine my mind
to the depth of fantasy

Sorrow breeds and injects the pain.
Demands to the state of mind

One's sorrow to confirm this cold affection
I am leaving without you today
Disharmony flows under my shallow skin
Fuck them all and let me fly down again
