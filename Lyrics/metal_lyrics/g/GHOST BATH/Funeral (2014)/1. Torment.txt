I am a failure. I am Nothing. 
I am a shadow of what it is to be a man. 
I am numb. I am silence. Forgive me. 
Why? Why me? 
I have no family. Only those who love an imaginary man more than me. 
You'll speak and think his name more than mine, after I die 
And I ill fade away. I try. Why? Why me? 
I am alone, but surrounded.
