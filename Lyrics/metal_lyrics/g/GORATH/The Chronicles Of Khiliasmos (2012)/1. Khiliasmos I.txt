[One thousand years may seem like an eternity to some, but it is a mere whisper in the gist of chaos. Blind is what they are, trapped in the bottomless pit that is their own narcissistic quintessence. Scattered to the wind like sand they wandered the desert before constructing the ultimate shrine for the Demiurge; YeruÅ¡alaym, The Holy Sanctuary. When all is done; scattered to the wind they will be once more, bereft of their imperfect narcissistic manifestation.]

Dust is what he gathered
Here at Har haBayith
To create the first man
In his flawed image
The first in a long lineage
Of slaves and serfs
All knowledge denied
Bred to crawl and serve
Crafted out of matter
A despicable, futile shell
Binding them to the earth
Unable to attain the divine
To worship Elohim, in vain
Never to look further
To the universe beyond
Where true wisdom lies
The only sacrifices made
Are those of the body
The binding of Yishaq
Hypocrisy exemplified
Two temples were erected
Here on this bleak mount
Remember Vespasian
Before the third constructed
PÄrÃ»Å¡Ã®m, hearing the divine
In the chinking of coins
Seeing the smile of God
In the shimmer of gold
No Messianic Age
No World to Come
Despair will be plentiful
All delicacies will be dust
All oaths will be broken
As truth turns into lie
No kings will be crowned
The sixth aeon is the last
There is no domination
Nor arrogant world rule
Only total liquidation
As material creation
Will fall
