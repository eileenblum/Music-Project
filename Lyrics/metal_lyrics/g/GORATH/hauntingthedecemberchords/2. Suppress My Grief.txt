On the wings of the black emperor
Made of the remnants of the grief
It fills the bitter patient desire
You can't suppress

Attack - dead soldiers
Attack - sons of hate
Attack - dead soldiers
Attack - hell is here

Shapeless thoughts cleave the heart
An empty silence - broken tear
You've seen the rebirth of today
He has announced his comeback

Attack - dead soldiers
Attack - sons of hate
Attack - dead soldiers
Attack - hell is here

Sky blows over fast
One by one see them vanish
Points of light in a black abyss
Bitter grief is the paint on the wall
A hole, huge desire too strong to go on

Come again!

Fraternized with your spirit
Full expressions in the art
Losing one's way in a maze
One pure breathe

Years passed until we realised
No more can we do
Defend against the enemy
You were not there

Sky blows over fast
One by one see them vanish
Is the paint on the wall?
A hole, huge desire too strong to go on
