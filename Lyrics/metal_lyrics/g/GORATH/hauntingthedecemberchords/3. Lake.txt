Crawling in this lake
Makes me sick and desperate
Messages drown me.

It seems to be fake just an illusion of life
We're so free to move if you don't get out of the water

One sparkle
One wave
Suddenly it hits all
Rise out of this dark blue

The water I swim in it seems calm and nice

It seems like I know
Knowing it all - swimming for life
The eternal past
It seems like I die, dying like you all
It seems like I crawl, crawling

Crawling in this lake
Makes me sick makes me desperate
Messages drown me
The water I swim in
It seems to be fake
It seems to be an illusion
