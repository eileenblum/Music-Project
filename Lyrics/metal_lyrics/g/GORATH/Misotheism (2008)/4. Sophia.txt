Cast down the Archons in the gaping abyss.
Let their wickedness bring forth their demise.
One will consume the other, unto the prime parent.
He in turn will turn against himself and cease to exist.

Their heavens will fall; one will fall upon the next.
All of their forces shall be consumed in fire.
Their alleged eternal realms are to be overturned.
Into the abyss they fall â¦ and that will be overturned as well.
