In the ruins of the Temple of Solomon a peculiar item was buried.
A secret that could wipe away everything.
Built upon the foundations of their lies.

Excavated by knights sworn to poverty.
By grace of the mysterious artifact.

Power and wealth now was theirs.
Templars, keepers of the Grail.

No faith in a religion so young.
Freed from all ludicrous lies.
Bestowed on the Western world.
Through the detestable book of lies.

Power and wealth now was theirs.
Templars, keepers of the Grail.
In darkened crypts in the Holy Land.
The Christian cross was not revered.

Deny Christ and the virgin birth.
Defy the sacraments in disgust.
True veneration for the head.
Abufihamet, the bearded idol.

A thorn in the eye of the Church and king alike.
The conspiracy was executed that Friday.
On the thirteenth of October Thirteen hundred and seven.
Tortured and burned, their secrets remain untouched.

âNo place for wisdom.
No room for insight.
Only blind devotion.
To your pitiable beliefs.
There is no salvation.
In the God you worship.
There is only deception.
Perversion of the truthâ.

Jacques De Molay!
Burned at the stake.
Murdered for your lies.

Jacques De Molay!
Cursed are your foes.
Jacques De Molay!
We will avenge thee!
