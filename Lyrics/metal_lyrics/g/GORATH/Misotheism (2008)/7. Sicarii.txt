As the Imperial Eagle overshadows Judea.
Ancient prophecies live again.
Of the One leading the Zealot cause.
Is He a mage, a king or perhaps a fraud?

The royal blood of David in his veins.
Born to bring forth the Messianic Age.
The anointed One: Christos, Mashiah.
Hailed by the Sicarii, the dagger-men!

But the Nazarene is not Him.
The magician is but a betrayer.
To grant Caesar what is his?
Demise shall be his only share!

All the hope is shattered.
Could the prophecy be wrong?
Has Yahweh truly forsaken us?
Or is he testing our faith?

"Step away from the others and I shall tell you.
The mysteries of the Kingdom.
It is possible for you to reach it,
But you will grieve a great deal.
For someone else will replace you,
In order that the twelve may again
Come to completion with their God.

You will become the thirteenth,
And you will be cursed by the other generations.
And you will come to rule over them.

In the last days they will curse your ascent to the holy generation.
Already your horn has been raised, your wrath has been kindled,
Your star has shown brightly and your heart has [rejected me]."

Let the wolves devour each other.
Let the Romans have their betrayer.
For a mere thirty silver coins.
We can open the way for a new Messiah.

The voice of moderation
Will die on the cross.
Away with pacifism,
Away with cowardice!

"Don't imagine that I came to bring peace on earth.
I did not come to bring peace.

"Don't imagine that I came to bring peace on earth.
I did not come to bring peace
But a sword!"
