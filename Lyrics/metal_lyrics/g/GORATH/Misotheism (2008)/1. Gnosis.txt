Lies â¦ a river of malicious words.
Is the foundation of your faith.
Seek the truth beyond him.
Follow the serpent, gain insight!
Rejoice upon the fruits of wisdom.
That the tree of life grants you.

Heed not the threats of the false god.
Rise up against the malicious God who.
Will turn the serpent into the devil.

For generations to come.
He is not love, nor compassion.

He is jealousy and vengeance.
The knowledge is yours to take.
For great is the blindness of those who read.
Do not believe him, do not serve him.
You will be deceived as many before you.

A divine spark enslaved in matter.
Damned is the whole of your creation.

Enslaver of the spirit, imprisoned in dust.
Binding us with chains of dogma.

âWorship me, I am your God!
Worship me, I am your creator!â

âYou are nothing!
My knowledge transcends yours,
Gnosis is within my reach, mine to take.
A higher understanding of the universe.

Of the greater whole that is all
I will not bow to a fraudulent deity.
The salvation you offer is misfortune,
A certain death in murky waters.â
