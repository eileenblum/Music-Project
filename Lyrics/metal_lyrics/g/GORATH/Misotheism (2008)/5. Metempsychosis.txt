The material world as it currently stands.
Was not created by the God of Light.
But by the malicious dark god Yahweh.
Who captured our spirits in this shell of suffering.

Only the spiritual realm implies absolute purity;
It is there and only there that liberation lies.
The material realm is nothing but an illusion.
A creation of evil, designed for suffering.

The "God" you worship is nothing but an impostor.
A lesser deity, the Demiurge.
A fraud and a liar, but a creator nevertheless.
Your church is devoted not to God, but to corruption.

You threaten your followers.
With an eternity in hell.
Still there is nothing worse.
Than the world we live in.

This world is the actual hell,
A prison created by your "God"

Where we are corrupted by your minions.
Metempsychosis; our only escape.

Never will your greedy claws.
Uncloak the gnostic secrets we guard.
Burn our mortal bodies if you must.
Here on the foot of MontsÃ©gur!

Metempsychosis - transmigration of the soul.
Metempsychosis - liberation from this hell.

Consolamentum perfecti!
