Still feel a desire to crawl back to those days.
When pleasure kissed
Never cheated
It was not perfect
Even not made that as a goal
A goal as an embrace

Just as fast as it fell
We know how thick our veins are
Pressure still feeds chaos
Broken beats seen as a cloud
The only one in the sky
Discover all...

Weeping shores connected with sun reflected waves
The black light in my life shines upon the smile of your death

Claim your word of hope in dying faces
Breathing blood right before your God
Wasting all the ways of direction
Overpowers the road of freedom

Resurrection of your dead God
A fairytale written in the books of your own
Enchant the unter with the power of white
Colored hands only they can embrace
In grey...
