Tears felt on her shoulders
Take care of my breath
He is dying with colours red
Shared every second
Is now a glowing wind in our heart
Chaos doesn't have permission:
To break, to leave, moments

A plane could save a hidden tear
Deep wrestling in my eye
They seek words
For someone somewhere
Will rise

A second became an aeon
A second with the sun is, is desire
Broken heart
Until your hands bleed

Kneel down at the end of the rainbow
Where colours no more shine bright
Hate will strike us all
Down we'll go and blood will flow

Ages have passed and more have to come
In silence we await the sun
The lights are gone...
And the world will glow no more

Aeons glow in the sun

Like colours fading to grey
What kind of cloud will embrace
Deep wrestling in my eye

Our instinct goes far
Blame it to your lackness
For not bringing you
Safely on your road home
