What kind of lies cross the border
Farther than anyone - harder than anyone
Messed up! One line is not fair
Iron cold stakes messed up
Made the earth black

Chaos left the dry tears
Mysteries too dark to capture

Too dark...

I am the lizard - rapes your wizard
On the ground - stamping your wizard
On the ground - stench is my lizard

Stronger with hate - harder with words
Brave with pitiful promises
Larger than your hand reaches above our red sky
Bursted from desire!

With fear I hunger
I crawl to the open feast
All swords will burn
Hear the demonic laughter

Presume the last wish kills the first hand
A square - dead and grey...

Still the same today
Still dead today!

What kind of lies cross the border
Farther than anyone - harder than anyone
Messed up!
