Chaos, death and pestilence
Shall reign the future past
Drums lead the orchestra
And cry out the war chants below
Let pain and horror divide them apart
One side of them all - one side just a few
It is not about what we feel but who we are

Life is an unstoppable road to death
They are not aware of the impact
Now rape, my brothers and sisters
Slay them all with their own guilt
And may their God have mercy for their bastard sons

Count them backwards taking out
The new days we are awaiting
One day the sun will stop shining
And forever - forever darkness will be spread
Disorder will be the language spoken

And hate will replace what they call love
Strife for the righteous and the strong

Stand by yourself and sort out the wrong
A chameleon of individuality is more free
Than a galactic form of pure power
Be yourself without losing control
Of what others may think of you
