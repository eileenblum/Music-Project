Winter, my dawn of sin
A star shines through
I can't see but notorious grief and pain

So cold - embrace me in your arms

Winter stole my plague and torture took my life
The ravenous and the non divine
Sorrow let snow fall

Winter - so cold

I see not through the dead of night
Watch this earthly paradise burn
Endless horror of death, blood and crucifixion

I am forsaken
Eternally hidden into a void

Winter - so cold
Demons, I'm far from home and still alone...
