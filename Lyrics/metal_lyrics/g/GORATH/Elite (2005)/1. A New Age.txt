This is a new age...

A star rises from the north
With full throttle it rages down
One step closer t(w)o-zero-twelve
Destination: Armageddon - Fixation: we all
Some will never understand the true essence...

Come on... From life to death!

Fatality comes after immortality
We are all the weak flesh of our own

Thoughts divide three times nothing
They may dream of a better world
They may deny it's coming down
Yet when total annihilation is unbound
A cry for God can be heard...

Forty years this journey will last
Predicted many times before in the past
Still not believing in the self fulfilling prophecy
May this day been set as number one

This is a new beginning!
This is a new age!
