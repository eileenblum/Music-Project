Blast... Rise...

Roar from this day
And stop no more
Enslave them all
And finish it in full glory
The apocalypse is there
Salvation is nearby
All thoughts are bonded in just one
They project what eyes cannot see

Hollow words screaming are less than nothing
May fear be the world its travel guide
And may we all turn to dust for a while
For we are no more than just a second of eternity

All thoughts combined into one
A mass revelation gathers strength
Many are there
Yet none understands

We are all worthless slaves
Black with no single colour at all

Swimming in a pond without drops!

We are all taking way too much
Waiting for hell to come down
