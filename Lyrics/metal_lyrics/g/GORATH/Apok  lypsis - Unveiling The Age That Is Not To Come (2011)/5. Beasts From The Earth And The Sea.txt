From the depths, it was stirring the waters
Unseen and unknown to this world
Imperceptible and cryptic until now
Yet an undeniable and tangible reality
Its very essence was chaos itself
Materialised into this impure carnal world
With the sole intention to make it return
To a state of chaos and lawlessness
From its mouth came words of truth
Blasphemy to the slaves of the Demiurge
But the purest untainted truth to the others
For if any man have an ear, let him hear!
Only chaos itself is everlasting
Every material thing will return to nothingness
The flesh of mortal men will age and rot
Temples for false gods will all crumble
From the depths, it was disturbing the earth
The beast that would complete the trinity
It exercised all power from the beast before
Leaving his mark on all roaming the earth
Its very essence was pure chaos itself
Materialised into this impure carnal world
With the sole intention to make it return
To the primeval state of chaos and lawlessness
It performed great wonders and miracles
Deception to the slaves of the Demiurge
But the attestation of reality to the others
It exercised all power from the beast before
Leaving his mark on all roaming the earth
For if any man have an eye, let him see!
Let him see!
