Armilus!
And so chaos will claim victory over order
As death will inevitably prevail over all life
The contingents of the Demiurge are driven back 
To the Abode of Peace, Ir David, Yerushalayim
No mercy for the conquered, as life is torment
Not striving to extinct a mere race, but mankind
Raging fires blacken all temples of arrogance 
No puny worldly tributes to false deities shall stand!
Antikhristos!
And so chaos will claim victory over order
As darkness will inevitably prevail over light
The next to fall was Roma
Burning once again, like in the days of Nero
The corporeal focus of their sins is dissolved 
As flesh turns to dust and is scattered in the wind 
When Mons Vaticanus is levelled it is made clear:
No puny worldly tributes to false deities shall stand!
Dajjal!
And so chaos will claim victory over order
As truth will inevitably prevail over all lies
Makkah Al Mukarramah, the last stronghold
Where the blind envisioned leading eternally
Hysterically professing his dominance over all 
Before returning to eternal and ageless nothingness
The burning ruins of Al-Masjid al-Haram testify
That no worldly tributes to false deities shall stand!
