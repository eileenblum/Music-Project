A thunderous voice commanded me to come
And see as the first seal was broken
A white horse appeared, carrying Pestilence
Eagerly accepting a crown,
Rushing into conquest - Vilon!

A red horse furiously stormed forward
Its rider War, was granted a massive sword
Destined to annihilate peace on this earth
To make the sons of man slay each other - Raki'a!

I then beheld a horse of the purest black
Famine sat on him, holding a balance
Eager to spread starvation and drought
The barren soil crumbles in your hands - Shehaqim!

The voice of the fourth creature resounded
And a pale horse now came into sight,
Ridden by the grim and ghastly Death
And was followed by Hades himself - Zebul!

The fifth seal now was opened
I saw the crying souls of
Those slain for the lies
Begging for vengeance - Ma'on!

With the sixth seal the earth trembled
The sun turned black and the moon was blood
All the stars of heaven fell unto the earth
Mountains were moved out of their place - Machon!

Hide from the face of the vile Demiurge,
High and mighty upon his illustrious throne
And from the rage of the slaughtered lamb
For the great day of his wrath has come - Araboth!
