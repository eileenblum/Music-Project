Source of matter â source of spirit.
Spiralling in and spiralling out.
People growing towards the sun.
Grow together and live as one...
As one...
Create, centre and renew.
Before the first dawning ever known.
Gods gathered on sacred ground.
Confessing sins around the fire.
Search the stars for what we are.
And find we need not look so far.
Inside of us, deep down inside.
Are kept the secrets of all time.
This ambitious divine self offering.
Feels there's plenty of time to stop, to end the rituals of its first creation.
And make the sun to be born.
Search the stars for what we are.
And find we need not look so far.
Inside of us, deep down inside.
Are kept the secrets of all time.
Finding rhythm â Speaking rhythm.
Renew the ancient paradigm.
Movement and measure, sowing and dawning.
Star of the evening, star of the morning.
The heart of all space sets the horizon ablaze.
A mysterious day sign, bringer of birth.
A new world was finally born.
And the first deed was brought to an end.
It comes from the stars and springs from the Earth.
One Ahau will start the churning.
Watch for Venus, begin the learning.
Teaching us the way to see and how to climb the Sacred Tree.
One Ahau will start the churning.
Watch for Venus, begin the learning.
Teaching us the way to see and how to climb the Sacred Tree.
The Sacred Tree...
