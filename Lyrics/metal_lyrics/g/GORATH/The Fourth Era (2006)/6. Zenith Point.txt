Godforsaken astral intelligence.
Suck us into your vortex world.
Take our worthless being to a summit.
To a zenith point between the stars.
Perceive the beauty of a blooming desert flower.
May the dream of life run in circles wide.
Through the soil we will live as gods.
And in eternity we will extol.
We will extol...
As not forgotten our true filthy nature.
The source of where it all springs.
Earth, water, wind fire.
The four elements hatching a devil's breed.
Earth, water, wind...
Fire.
Self destructive intentions.
Genetically hand down ambitions of greed.
Just a few steps to go under.
The soil where it all was set in motion.
Live by the traditions of the maize.
And despite the empty minded we should embrace.
Each evolution is a step backwards.
With no minus zero decisive answers.
