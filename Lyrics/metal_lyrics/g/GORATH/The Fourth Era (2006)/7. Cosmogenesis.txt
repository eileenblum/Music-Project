Raped from her own mother's womb.
She gave birth to where time is not defined.
Raped from her own mother's womb.
She gave birth to where time is not defined.
Aligned with the aisle of the stars.
Life has been created at all times it was before.
An in-existent notion undefined.
Each centre has its deity.
Some were false others were proven good.
In a world of which cannot be said.
Intelligence has reached borders abroad.
Once foreground and background itemize.
Add the ir- on reversible.
To recognize time does go back.
To primeval galaxies not imaginary.
Some may deny of what cannot be sensed.
Yet they do glorify.
Know there where three cosmic centres: polar, zenith and galactic.
Some may deny of what cannot be sensed.
Yet they do glorify.
A cosmological orientation points out there is only one.
One shift unable to turn.
One room divides darkness from light.
Our own spiral of life.
Our nature of it all.
Each centre has its deity.
Some were false others were proven good.
In a world of which cannot be said.
Intelligence has reached borders abroad.
Once foreground and background itemize.
Add the ir- on reversible.
