During the first era there was earth and all living creatures living on it.
Nor bird or beast fit the match fine and pleased the gods they should.
During the second and third era there was men not as we know it in post-modern times.
No men whatsoever fit the match fine and pleased the gods they should.
Perception nihil â triple annihilation.
During the fourth and also last era men returned never to match again.
Time is ending the invention itself.
As everything reduces to the outset.
In nanoseconds the previous doubles.
Defined methods become infinite.
And time will exist no more.
Cloning the invincible landscape.
The Mandelbrot fractal pattern reveals each time sixty-four times life on earth, times another creation, times historical time started.
And a year of many changes.
During the fifth era a new dawning will be born.
It will be known as space being reshaped.
The new math of nature exploding all what once was.
A spiritual re-birth on the point of null.
Inverted psychological collective consciousness.
We embrace the world in our hands...
