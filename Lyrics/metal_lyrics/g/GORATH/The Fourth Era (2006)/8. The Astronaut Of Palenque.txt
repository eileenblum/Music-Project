From across the endless oceans that border these ancient lands.
The bearer of the serpent seal came.
On a dragon cutting through the waves.
He bore the traits of a race unknown.
His weathered skin was fair and pale.
His imposing beard bore the same colour.
As furious wave tops breaking on the shore.
So was his hair, waving in the briny wind.
His fierce, piercing erudite eyes in between.
Seemed to contain the bluest mountain sky.
When he spoke, he did in a tongue unknown.
The strange words that rolled over his lips.
Were previously unheard on these Mayan shores.
Yet his deep voice conveyed divine wisdom.
Patiently the stranger initiated them.
They learned to grow crops and harvest.
The art of writing was revealed to them.
One day, the bearer of the serpent left.
Back over the great ocean, never to return.
Never, never, never...
Votan...
Throughout the ages, generations came and went.
Men and their sons would gaze at the horizon.
In vain waiting for he, who gave all meaning.
Still his name would echo for aeons on end.
He bore the traits of a race unknown.
His weathered skin was fair and pale.
His imposing beard bore the same colour.
As furious wave tops breaking on the shore.
