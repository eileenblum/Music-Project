Remember your greed, your numbness and your fault
Washed away the human race of God
The end of the line, die for your sins
Swallow the death, feel teh taste of pain

Remember the reason just for your greed 
Remember the reason this is your fault

There is some hope, faith for your bleeding world
So beg for it and beg for your lost souls
Remember what you've done, hear the screams again
Every single tear of blood, for every human mind
