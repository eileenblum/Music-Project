Tear down the walls
Wake up the death
I've chosen to suffer
The level of soulless life

Hiding behind (the veil)
Leader ot the chosen one
Fed up the nightmare
Spreading their desease

Summon the beast
Call loud out his name
Starring eyes ot the death
Where angels do not fly

Behind the gates of hell
Fooling the blind
Crawling the dark
Hold your breath when I die

Follow the traces
Living on your knees
Feeling the fears
Again and again

Cold as the world around
Reach the field
Of rotten souls
Watching the
Frozen pain 
In search of souls inside 
An ancient force of might 
Where angels do not fly

The land where I was strong 
Where creatures come and go 
Watchin the frozen pain 
In search of souls inside 
An ancient force of might 
Where angels do not fly

Autumn still cries 
Whispers around 
Unleash the beast 
Obscure the light

Flee from the void 
Unveil the death 
Is heard from above

Angels cry before they die

Hiding behind (the veil) 
Leader of die chosen one 
Fed up the nightmare 
Spreading their desease

Summon the beast 
Call loud out his name 
Starring eyes of the death 
Where angels do not fly
