I am the savior, battalions of hate
I am master of all despair
I am the guardian of the chosen one
I am the lord leader of the end

Look at what we have become
A lie of all mankind
The world we have created
Left me alone with pain

No future â no future
I see the world broken
No future â no future
The last words are spoken

A life so painful shall never forget
A life so fearful, bleeding eyes
The pain inside designs my mind
The deepest thoughts, welcome to hell

Lost in the space of death
So painful and deep
The time is here and now
At the end of the line

No future â no future
The last words are spoken
No future â no future
I see the world broken 

Run away, end this pain
It will never be the same
Move your head, act of grace
You will not live like that
No hope, no future
Iâm gonna change your life
Awake the void, balance break
Iâm gonna change your life
