Another reason for my suicide
Lose control of your twisted mind
Another reason to end my life
Wake up with the death at your side

I will take my destiny
Set my soul on free
For ten thousand times
Again

I will build the perfect bridge
With the knowledge that I have
I've seen the future in hell

I show no fear for my suicide
Take the life, in my own hands
I show no fear to live my dreams
I have to go - alone

Another reason for my suicide 
Lose control of your mind

I'll walk the earth
I shall rise again, a beast
I'll have the power
To bring the end
I'll march with the death

Another reason - manipulate your life 
Another reason - this is my master plan
