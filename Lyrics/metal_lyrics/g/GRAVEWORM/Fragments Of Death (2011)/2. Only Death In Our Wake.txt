From the ashes of time 
The spirits appeared
Screams of pain from mankind
The end of all life

Slaves for the leaders of hate
Poison flows through our veins
Eating from inside extinct the light 
Only dead in our wake

Blood for blood, I break your lies
Your dying eyes see the dark
Cry - die for me
Your false world will fall for insanity

From a land beyond
Appears on the sky
Damnation - terrible faith
Decades of damnation will arrive

See the suffering souls
Swift away like the wind
Descend into the abyss of pain 
Make this hell only for your pastime

All I see pain beyond pain 
Only death will survive
Never see the true way of life 
Only dead in our wake

Slaves â I will see through your haze 
Lost inside the maze
Slaves - Your innocent souls 
Surrounded by the ghost
Slaves - Unending pain
That always breeds within
Slaves â Between the misery
Only dead in our wake

Blood for blood, I break your lies
Your dying eyes see the dark
Cry-die for me
Your false world will fall for insanity

From the ashes of time 
The spirits appeared
Screams of pain from mankind
The end of all life

Slaves for the leaders of hate
Poison flows through our veins
Eating from inside extinct the light 
Only dead in our wake

Slaves - Lost inside the maze
Slaves - Surrounded by the ghost
Slaves - That always breeds within
