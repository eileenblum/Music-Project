They take the soul and our faith
Enemies â raped our lives
Through hell we march
Again and back

A false belief and a liar
Prophets â of forbidden land
A pain so real and near
The end has just begun

Pain, hate, fear and death
They share the soul of every human kind
Fire, straight, torment and scare
Their blood flows
Like raindrops from the sky
The sky will fall and crushed
Hope. Gone far away
Everything seems so lost, God is dead 

Their torments rise again
Demons â angels of death
Before my faith turns to dust 
I will stand in hell

Itâs never late to kill a life
Choose not to see the death by your side
Itâs like a war in my fucking head
We fight to die, I am your nightmare  

Walk the line of death
Swallow their lies
Through darkness Iâve been
Keep me going on and on

For all the pain you caused
Lost â what Iâve never had
Until the end of life
You will burn inside
