Before the beginning of fear 
There came to the passing to dark
Faith, with the anger of dead
Like with the pleasure of man

Do this do that right now
There is no place to hide
For him for honor 
Our faith and our pride

Is that the price to pay?
The secrets of life passed away
With pain and sorrow
Condemned our world
To absence of faith

What is your fear,condemned to hell
The time has come loneliness arrived
Illuminate the gate to hell

Why canât I fade the deepest depth
Why must I feel pain and death
What must I gave to face the light
Why must I live with enemies beside
