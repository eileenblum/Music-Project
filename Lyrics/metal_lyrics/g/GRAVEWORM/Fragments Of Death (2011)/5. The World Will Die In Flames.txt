Time has come to rage insanity
Inside the storm
Arrive at the edge of the world
Fall into the land of passion
No more resistance
Slaughter their innocent souls
Kill their tortured minds

Weâre sealing our own identity
Screaming souls that we will never hear
Just one shot to go to hell
There will be no more lies to tell

Where slaughter means a famous victory
Weâre all obsessed to be their destiny
Death devour our souls and minds
Just fight and die for our glorious time

Iâve seen the future
Iâve been the past
I brought the terror
I am your new god

Take me away from this torment
Drown into the dark
Tears of blood from suffering souls

The world will collapse in pieces
Rape your breath 
Prepare to kill the human kind
The world will die in flames
