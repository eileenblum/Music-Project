On my kneesâ¦

I will not treat you as god
For what you have done to me
For all the fear I felt
For all the homeless childâs

Planets collide, weâre doomed to die
Never be free from fear
A storm is arriving, true death inside
Never be free from tears, our tears

There is no way, recover the world
For all the lies you told us
For all the pain you sent
For all the ruin you caused

There will be no more beliefs
Our faith is gone like the wind
For all the dead you brought
For the chance that not was

Angels die, eternal darkness falls
Never be free from fear
Breaking the chains with a desperate cry
Never be free from tears, our cries

Have no sin â look at my pride

I will not treat you as god
For what you have done to me
For all the fear I felt
For all the homeless childâs

For all the pain you caused
