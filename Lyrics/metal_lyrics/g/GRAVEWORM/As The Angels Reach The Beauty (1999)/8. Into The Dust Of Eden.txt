When the moon is full 
The stars are shining bright 
Children of the night 

Following the path 
Searching for the light 
The visions of the time 

As the rain starts falling to the ground 
The angels flying high 
And (the) candles burning all around 
The dust of Eden light 

Searching for the way 
Dwells in deepest dark 
The sound of heaven calls 

Into promised land 
Where sleeping angels lie 
Surrounded by their song 

As the moon is rising in the sky 
I see the sacred stone 
And the gate of heaven will arrive 
The power of this world 

Where I should die 
Angels spreading their wings of flames 
Flying with the winds of fate 
Through mirrors of heavenly forces 
See the shining light 

Lying - on the lake 
Awaiting - the time 
Seeing - the moonlight sky 
Fighting - for your soul 

Ablazing souls 
Searching for the way 
Surrounded songs 
Falling from the earth 
When I shall see the dust of Eden light 

Portals of faith 
Standing behind my self 
Mother of earth 
Release me from my pain 
When I shall see the dust of Eden light 

When the moon is full 
The stars are shining bright 
Children of the night 

Following the path 
Searching for the light 
The visions of the time 

As the rain starts falling to the ground 
The angels flying high 
And candles burning all around 
The dust of Eden light 

Searching for the way 
Dwells in deepest dark 
The sound of heaven calls 

Into promised land 
Where sleeping angels lie 
Surrounded by their song 

As the moon is rising in the sky 
I see the sacred stone 
And the gate of heaven will arrive 
The power of this world
