Here the cries form (the) dying mankind 
In the garden of unholy ground 
Whispering voices, summoning screams 
Appearing shadows on my face 

Far away in the dark fading light 
As the ravens cry 
And the pleasure of night will arrive 
To fight the scarlet sky 

See the sky 
When angels fly 
Hear their screaming pain 
Out of the dark 

When they leave 
Her kingdom light 
Soldiers of the night 
The demons fight 

As darkness falls upon thy face 
Whispers in the dark 
Swallowing the moonlight sky 
The guardians of the night 
Draped in sinister pain 
Captured in sin 
On battlefields of ancient time 
The ending life begins 

Upon my self 
Awaken from hell 
Spreading it wings 
Crying out loud 
The bleeding eyes of death 

Forgotten realms 
Under the moon 
Standing in fear 
Ebony tears 
Symphonies in blood 

Symphonies in blood
