As creatures as warriors , once roaming the earth 
The darkness embracing the landscape below 
Centuries of dark shall crack open the sky 
A dragon is waiting and watching the light 

Ashes to ashes and dust will be dust 
An evergreen land where the lord shall command 
As I wait in rapture the sword in my hand 
Faith in the keepers of our legends 

The patron of right shall remain on his throne 
Fighting the evil, destroying their souls 
Shadows of creatures, as ravens will fly 
Whispering voices , infernal decay 

As evil damnation spreading it wings 
Through winds of salvation , riding my faith 
Fire on heaven as silence will break 
Have faith in your warrior and I shall arise 

Beyond the darkness - reflecting shadows 
In trail of nightmare 
I hear the nocturnal hymns of the death 

Forever silence - dreaming winter 
In trails of nightmare 
I feel the nocturnal hymns in my face 

A dragon is flying in nocturnal sky 

Fighting with fire , the blindness embrace 
Reflections of deepest emotion I see 
Awaiting the creature of eternal flame 
Trough fire and cruelty I watching the sky 

Feeling the anger of the burning souls 
A kingdom in fear will remain behind 
The dragon is rising on almighty side 
With hate in my mind, I will fighting his life 

Will fighting his life - his life 

Blood on my sword , your rapture I feel 
Desire of pain , the light shall remain 
Suffering screaming, raping my breath 
Summoning of terror, stained with blood 
Wrapped in fear, visions of dread 
Darkness remains, heaven and hell 
Dragons surviving the fighting mankind 
Ages of fear, remaining the same 

Beyond the darkness - reflecting shadows 
In trail of nightmare 
I hear the nocturnal hymns of the death 

Forever silence - dreaming winter 
In trails of nightmare 
I feel the nocturnal hymns of red blood
