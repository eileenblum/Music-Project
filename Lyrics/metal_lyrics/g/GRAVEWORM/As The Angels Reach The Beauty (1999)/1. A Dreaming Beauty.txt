Across the open fields, on burial ground 
Beside the ancient lake, through painful screams 
When pride of darkness rise, upon the sky 
We are marching, side by side 

A darkness feeling our pride 
The moonchild crying in the sky 
Screaming echos in the air 
Feel the burning flame inside 
A kiss of death I will receive 
For invoking melodies 
Evil spheres enclose my soul 
Awaiting (a) mournful symphony 

Shadows are grasping - devouring misery 
Shining of demons - destroying my faith 

From the darkest abyss 
Where the laughter pierce the air 
They arrive with thunderstorms form the sky 
Bloodred melodies 
When the silence crushed by dead 
As they riding through my soul and my fear 

Lying in the shadows 
In the place where roses die 
Dreaming beauty waiting for her bloodred kiss of death 
As the angels singing echos in the torpid sphere of dark 

Awaiting in the shadows 
Wolves running by my side 
Damnation reach the beauty 
Wept upon the waveless lake 
A velvet painting appearing 
On the bloodred moonlight sky 

Shadows are grasping - devouring misery 
Shining of demons - destroying my faith 

Through the spheres of pain 
Spirits running to the place 
As they hearing your screaming pain 
Serenades in red 
Darkness falls upon thy veil 
As they (are) whispering my name in the air 

Lying in the shadows 
In the place where roses die 
Dreaming beauty waiting for her bloodred kiss of death 
As the angels singing echos in the torpid sphere of night
