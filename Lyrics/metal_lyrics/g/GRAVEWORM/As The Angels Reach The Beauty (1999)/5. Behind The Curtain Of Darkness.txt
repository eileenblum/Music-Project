... thy dying light 
Howling screams I hear 
Through forest dusk , the autumn shade 
Different shades of dark 
With hate embracing melancholy 
Thy kingdom of the throne 
As gardens die and heavens shake 
Open scarlet sky 

Burning candles 
Like bleeding eyes of wrath 
Though mirrors of freedom 
I'm starring deep within 

In times of war and dragons lore 
And monuments of stone 
The reflections of deepest blackness 
Prevail the holy faith 

Awaken from shadows 
Lying behind the light 
Wings of twilight 
Falling rain on earth 

This mournful sound of darkness 
Capturing my sin 
Within the hearth of harmony 
A new beginning dawn 
Awaken from eternal sleep - Mistress of the dark 

With claws of darkness angels 
Shred the bloodred sin 
The secret of the ancient dark 
Behind the queen of night 
Dying echos on their ground 
Screaming souls in fear 
Forgotten tales of sorrow 
Of feeble mortals life 

Whispers of creatures 
Flying with the winds 
Coldest claws of evil 
Searching for my soul 

Within the voids of endless grieve 
The angels of the death 
Behind the curtain of darkness 
Still waiting for a soul 
Awaken from eternal sleep - Mistress of the dark
