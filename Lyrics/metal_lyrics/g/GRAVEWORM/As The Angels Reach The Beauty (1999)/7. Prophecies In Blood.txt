Striking over oceans of blood 
Over kingdom in fear they march 
The shadows rising from last sleep 
The darkside will arrive 
Storms of evil, thunder and might 
Tormented souls awake 
Creatures of the darkest night 
As damnation reach the sky 

Beneath a veil of sward 
Embracing land of light 
Reflections of deepest hate 
Die - for centuries of dark 

Swallowing the moonlight sky - conspiracy of pain 
As darkness falls upon thy face - prophecies in blood 
And tainted sky where angels cry - conspiracy of pain 
The wolven screams of deepest hate - prophecies in blood 

The dying secrets of decay 
Caressing shadows, demon?s slave 
Upon the throne of pain 
Immortal screams again 

The ending of the human earth 
Breaking silence, falling rain 
The time has come to die 
Has come to die - die 

Here the whispers in the wind 
See the burning flames clawing at the skies 
Death's not far away 
Nature dies of massive cries 

Somewhere deep within the night 
They riding on the death 
Bringing blood an painful fear 
Forever in this land 
Deeply sighs and spread their wings 
As blindness falls upon 
And armed with the seals (of) pain 
Serenades in blood 

Beneath a veil of sward 
Embracing land of light 
Reflections of deepest hate 
Die - for centuries of dark 

Swallowing the moonlight sky - conspiracy of pain 
As darkness falls upon thy face - prophecies in blood 
And tainted sky where angels cry - conspiracy of pain 
The wolven screams of deepest hate - prophecies in blood
