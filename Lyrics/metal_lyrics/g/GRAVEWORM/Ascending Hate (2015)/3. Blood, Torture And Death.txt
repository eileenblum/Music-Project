Once we were scum of the Earth
Now we're forces of death
Struggling the souls of human race

Bound by chains, the savior of hate
Awaiting the day to die
Soldiers defy â my final breath

Broken and defeated
Bring me to the afterlife
Bring me to the end
Blood, torture and death

Blind the hate of the world
Crush the enemies of hope
Conquer the land of the slaves

Spread the seed, change their way
The world falls into dark
Fuelled by hate, crucify (the might)

Blood, torture and death
Blood, torture and death

Broken and defeated
Bring me to the afterlife
Bring me to the end
Blood, torture and death

Once we were scum of the Earth
Now we're forces of death
Struggling the souls of human race

Bound by chains, the savior of hate
Awaiting the day to die
Soldiers defy â my final breath
