In the land of broken faceless minds
The fury of the mighty shield, God's curse
Captured in lies, sentenced
As the rage of blood flows like rain

For the power of lions and men
We let them suffer in pain â again!
We lead the forces â our path has been laid

You will never see what they see
When you die for your dream
You will never feel what they feel
Because you're buried alive

We reach the gate, the tunes of war are blown
The buried smell of death, your fear
We suffocate their life!
They need a slave to do the kill

Walls of temple, a broken existence
The price of war must be paid
Dead â free of all our sins
I see the fire again

Nothing will be like when a dead man cries
Suffocate, I'm buried alive
Nothing will be heard, tremble with fear
Blind, I'm buried alive
