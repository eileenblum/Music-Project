I have destroyed every sign of your life
Rot in hell â son of a bastard rise
There is no lie that I can't survive
Your self-deception, killed by your god

When it's time to dying
It's always time for crying
Can't you see, I'm not your enemy

Son of lies
We stroke the fear so deep
Son of lies
Your visions still remain

Into the lies

Arise from the sea of lies
Escape towards my fears

The shades of vengeance
Stand before my eyes

Despise all the weak
Unfold forgotten time
The death revenge
Terrorize with pain

Will you lie again?
Will you fear me?
You have to die for me
I have to be the one

You have to be the one
Son of lies
You have to be the last one
