Death will strike again

I feel the wrath â this is the final stand
I feel the shame â when I cross your path

I want to hear the screams
I want to feel the pain
I will control your mind and thoughts
I've searched for blood â the vengeance unfolds
For every single thing â your destiny is mine

Your destiny is mine!

I walk the path of life again
This is something I shall not forget

Never doubt the power of life
I will stand my ground for my god
Guard your strength
Approaching the end

Light your sign
March toward Death

I see your world â before it starts to burn
I feel the hate â when you crushed the ground

Open the gates of hell
I see the fire burn
A new-found path â and endless wrath
The army rises â the shadows of past
Only vengeance will give me pleasure

So now we fight the world again
An ancient legion breaks the chains
We draw our strength rising to the sky
Let the Heaven fall once again
Let the Heaven fall once again

I brought to life
My legions unleashed
With dark deception
they serve to kill
The downfall of Heaven
It will never rise again
