How do you breathe in the fire,
How do you walk with fear?
Tell me what's so grand
Tell me is this the end

Fire â let them burn
Fire â kill them all
But a growing pain cannot explain behavior

Fire â strike back
Fire â no escape
Throw your blood, I'll be waiting for resistance

When time is despised
The mindless goes blind
What will there be left?
Your blood on the field
And there will be dead
Beside the new-born
A fear of the unknown
Death in the shape

In Death â we shall conquer the night
In Death â we are searching for more
In Death â we swallow the lies
In Death â we will rise again
