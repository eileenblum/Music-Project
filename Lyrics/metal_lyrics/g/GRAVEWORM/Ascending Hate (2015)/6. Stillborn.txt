Explode the fire of ravage
Five times I face the breathless
My thoughts are ruling the world
In search for freedom I draw the lines

One million times before I die
To feel the dark as I fall apart
Struggle against the way of life
In search for dreams
I cry for my soul

Caught in the lie of godless crime
You are stillborn â no feelings are mine
Don't throw the page â don't throw the life
You are stillborn â vanish through the sky

Living between life and death
Feeling the blind so unreal
Losing your mind as gone blind
Reborn without a sense

Screaming, dying, fearing the dark
Shattered frames of death
Reborn a goddamned lie
Stillborn â there's no way back

Reborn a world of silence
Five times I walk the path
Again I'm fearing the unknown
A deadly poison â the only way to be

Living between life and death
Feeling the blind so unreal
Losing your mind as gone blind
Reborn without a sense

Feeling empty inside yourself
Shattered frames of death
Reborn a goddamned lie
Stillborn â there's no way back

There's no way back â stillborn
