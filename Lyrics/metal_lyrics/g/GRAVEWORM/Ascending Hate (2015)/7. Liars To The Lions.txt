Their lies are falling
A thousand smiles
No matter how you scream
For vengeance

I wanna see you bleed
A thousand dead
to drain you to a quiet place

I see the Death
Torture your soul
You call the name of your god

Can't waiting, can't breathing
Until I'm final death
Still lying, still praying
I'm not afraid of you
Can't seeing, can't screaming
I've reached the end of life
I'm waiting, I'm fearing
Until the lions' law

And now your life is ending
For all the lies you've done
The flesh ripped in half
Throw away your soul

Your blood spilled out
We don't give a fuck
Bleed for the gods
Terminate with fear and hate

I dread his wearing
A thousand times
It sets me free to fear your hate

My thoughts are crushing
In thousand pieces
How long it takes until you fall

I see the fear
I rip your flesh
And you will never rise again

Can't waiting, can't breathing
Until I'm final death
Still lying, still praying
I'm not afraid of you
Can't seeing, can't screaming
I've reached the end of life
I'm waiting, I'm fearing
Until the lion's â the lions' law
