In the land where the angels fly
And the throne of heaven lies
Hear the distant echos - enchanted songs

Far away in the distant sky
I see a flame that burns in the night
In the silence of the endless time - I'll ride

A howling wind across the sea
Turning black the sky and the light
Creature of the night - hear them cry

As the wolves howls to the night
The ruins glows in the dark
To the twilightland arrive
I sailed the darkened way
And another age has come
The birth of a new dawn
Alone in the forest of shadows
Without one path to go
I was left alone
At the path of my faith
Struggling against the wind
Walking through deep snow
A silent voice in your head
Therefore you must die

A lightning strikes from the darkened sky
A bloodred sign appears in the night
The evil has arrives - the ravens flies

Surrounded by the screamings of pain
The ancient demon of forgotten realm
The knights of incubus - seducted by the dark

Soon to be entombed in the soil
Swept away by the mortal tide
The demon has arrived - arise from the sleep

The secrets behind the black endless void
Fearfull thoughts with hate in his eyes
Arrives from the darkened sky

Born again in twilight's myth
With wings soiled in blood
Again his wrath shall rule
The genesis of death
Rising up from the flames
And fight for revenge
