She feared the light - she sacrified
Human soul for nocturnal sky
The blood of their life for art divine

Candels in fear - when shadows arrives
In moonlightning darkness in beautiful sight
Enlaving the beast of the unholy might

I fade away - into silence embrace
The eyes of pain bleeding for faith
Centuries of dusk and demons

Arrive!

When evil arrives from black velvet sky
When shadows increase, damnation arrives
When faces of hell turned into black
When screamings of pain crushed in the night
When voices of death calls for revenge
Welcome the beast in honour of hell

When innocent blood - sacrified in the night
Rapture the breath of beautiful time
Stained with blood on the altar of pain

She prised his name - the beast of all crime
The wolves sing - feeling the wrath
Nameless souls are trapping in the night

Beneath the spread of magical rites
Red roses die - enslaving to flame
The wrath of the night infesting her mind

A dark moonless sky - the malice embrace
Out of the dark - smelling his breat
She raising the chalice up to the sky

When evil arrives from black verlvet sky
When shadows increase, damnation arrives
When faces of hell turned into black
When screamings of pain crushed in the night
When voices of death calls for revenge
Welcome the beast in honour of hell
Unhallowed by the infernal might
The power of death is now arrives

"An angel stole my heart ...
...and Death took her away"
