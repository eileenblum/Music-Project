What was the reason for you doing that?
What was the reason for your prevention?
I've searched so long for you
For you

What was the reason for you
Doing that?
What was the reason for your
Prevention?
I've searched so long for you
Endless nights
We promised to take it
All the deeps and highs

Timeless, deedless, honest
My second I, second I
My second I
Helpless, sadness
It's time for say goodbye
My second I

What was the reason for you
Doing that?
What was the reason for your
Prevention?
I've searched so long for you
My whole life
We promised to take it
Through the breaking tides

Forlorn, forlorn hope
Broken down
Forlorn, forlorn hope
In agony I remain

(In agony I remain)
(In agony I remain)
(In agony)

Loneliness I fear
For senseless I cry
Forgotten in my mind
Blackened my heart
Is this the reason
Why I should die for you?
Rest in the darkness
Aimless and alone
Frames of my inner self
Lost in a cell of war
Forlorn hope
What was the reason why?

Forlorn, forlorn hope
Broken down
Forlorn, forlorn hope
In agony I blame

Forlorn, forlorn hope
Forlorn, forlorn hope

Timeless, deedless, honest
My second I, second I
My second I
Helpless, sadness
It's time for say good bye
My second I

What was the reason for you
Doing that?
What was the reason for your
Prevention?
I've searched so long for you
Bittersweet lie
We promised to take it
Through the breaking tides
I've searched so long for you
Endless nights
I've searched so long for you
My whole life
