Yeah
Whoa

The mighty horde
With swords and shields
For vengeance they ride
They fight the lives
Of innocent souls
For kingdom and might

Draw the blood
Crush their lives
The enemy shall pay
Fire and light
Enemies of kind
Silence before the storm

Shall bring the end
To kill the line
Faithful servants of God
Breaking down
Worship insane
To end the battle of child

Vengeance is sworn
The world will burn
Terror controlled
Through malicious world
Call upon the dead
Warriors from the black will rise
Prophets of deceased
Surrounded by a field

Yeah
Whoa

Magic words
No god will help to die
Engrave the fate
How does it feel?
Fire and light
Silence of mankind
Bodies around
Vengeance is sworn
Last words I cry
Now the false will pay
Sleep in blood
Vengeance is sworn
Pain and death
????
Walk the blood-soiled ground
Vengeance is sworn

Follow the blind
????
Sweeping with it
Across the fields they blow
Wait without fear
Walk the blood-soiled ground
No mercy will shown
Vengeance is sworn

Clouds of blood, covers the night
Day turns into night
Destroy the battle, fear the resistance
Sacrifice their souls
Corpses of fate, centuries of hate
Surrounds the human minds
Pride and glory, fight for the kind
There is no turning back

Lost in world, lost in time
Time has come to an end
All we know is what they know
Making sure we are blind

Magic words
No god will help to die
Engrave the fate
How does it feel?
Fire and light
Silence of mankind
Bodies around
Vengeance is sworn
Last words I cry
Now the false will pay
Sleep in blood
Vengeance is sworn
????
????
Walk the blood-soiled ground
Vengeance is sworn

Vengeance is sworn
Vengeance is sworn
