Yeah
Yeah

Build as a sign with feelings of hate
Tried to change the life of fate
Talked about just being god
Miserable life of the dying mop

I don't care about your pain
I don't care about your blood
Let my visions be the name
Darkness falls upon your graves

Riding on a crimson wave
Drifting in darkest days
Open your scars
Architects of hate
When sorrow breeds
Breathing in black air
Gathering of fear
Architects of hate
Yearning for emotions
Leaving god for hell
Whispers of dead man
Architects of hate
Formed new ways
Confusion rest
Sadistic hands
Architects of hate

Create a world with the essence of night
Shades of gray, darkness and might
Deadly cries for my inner soul
Spit you out so fucking cold

I don't care about your pain
I don't care about your blood
Let my visions be the name
Darkness falls upon your graves

These are the days
The era of night
Fading away
Screamings of pain
Darkness and fight
Deadly despise
Architects of hate
In my death eyes

Riding on a crimson wave
Drifting in darkest days
Open your scars
Architects of hate
When sorrow breeds
Breathing in black air
Gathering of fear
Architects of hate
Yearning for emotions
Leaving God for hell
Whispers of dead man
Architects of hate
Formed new ways
Confusion rest
Sadistic hands
Architects of hate

These are the days
The era of night
Fading away
Screamings of pain
Darkness and fight
Deadly despise
Architects of hate
In my death eyes

Riding on a crimson wave
Drifting in darkest days
Open your scars
Architects of hate
When sorrow breeds
Breathing in black air
Gathering of fear
Architects of hate
Yearning for emotions
Leaving God for hell
Whispers of dead man
Architects of hate
Formed new ways
Confusion rest
Sadistic hands
Architects of hate
