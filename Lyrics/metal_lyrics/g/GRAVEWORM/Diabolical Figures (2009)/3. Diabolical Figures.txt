I'm still awake
But I don't feel alive
Feel my hate
And wait for me to die
(To die)

I wanna see your bleed
Just kill your name
I steel your life
Still remains a lie

Torture, let the killing begins
Blinded, stand in the falling blood
Illusions, through a tunnel of madness
Forever, diabolical figures

Terror will reign
There's nothing left to claim
I will take your breath
Until you go insane
(Go insane)

I'll destroy your life
Death will be your final call
Just like a storm
Crushed the humankind

Hear, motherfuckers

Rage of figures, the end is near
Born to die, have no pride
Reign of terror, this is war
Hopeless and rentless, souls left behind
Blood, fire, death
The earth is losing
Diabolical figures arise
Arise

You want to seek revenge
But you don't have the tools
I join the feast
And kill what burns inside
(Burns inside)

Realize the fear
When it's too late to go
Don't believe the mask
Have to play the victim game

Torture, let the killing begins
Blinded, stand in the falling blood
Illusions, through a tunnel of madness
Forever, diabolical figures

I feel the fear takes hold
Lies made sense somehow
I will destroy your life
That's the will to kill
(To kill)

Nothing gonna stop me now
All your hope is gone
Will you ever understand?
Living on your knees

Rage of figures, the end is near
Born to die, have no pride
Reign of terror, this is war
Hopeless and rentless, souls left behind
Blood, fire, death
The earth is losing
Diabolical figures arise
Diabolical figures
