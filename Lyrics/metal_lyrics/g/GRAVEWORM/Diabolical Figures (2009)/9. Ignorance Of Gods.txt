Innocence of bloodbath
Liberate from within
Conquest of a fearful mind
Victims in their blood

Crushing down the strokes
Fighting for salvation
Destroy the enemies line
With no fear and pride

Ride the killing
With the beast inside
Unleash the nightmare
Screams of pain
I'm gonna die in hell
No one will holding me back
Blood work infections
Sickness between the lines

You were crushed
Thrown to ground
With no choice
To refuse the game
Think you re free
But there are lies
Every day is controlled
By someone around

Destroy your bones
(Destroy your bones)
Throw away your mask
(Throw away your mask)
Find your end
(Find your end)
In darkest ecstasies

Paralyze the angels
Fragments of death
Sin of life fading away
Tyranny in torment
Killing intentions
Pleased with the way of decay
Kill, blood, death

For the ignorance of gods

Engrave the knife with hate and despair
Flashing blade rips the flesh
Blood pours like rain from the sky
Crushing life with my will

Now hate is gone but emptiness remains
I have to kill again
Through the eyes of a hateful man I will see
The victims falling one by one

Welcome the liar, face on the ground
Haunting the faceless, lost in the game
Perverted creation, damned in hell
Follow the traces, choking of blood

Live you hell
And don't try
To find salvation
You ll burn to ash
Think you re free
But there are lies
Every day is controlled
By someone around

Destroy your bones
(Destroy your bones)
Throw away your mask
(Throw away your mask)
Find your end
(Find your end)
In darkest ecstasies

You were crushed
Thrown to ground
With no choice
To refuse the game
Think you re free
But there are lies
Every day is controlled
By someone around

Destroy your bones
(Destroy your bones)
Throw away your mask
(Throw away your mask)
Find your end
(Find your end)
In darkest ecstasies
