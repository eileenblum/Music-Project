The world I see, the lies I hear
The hate I feel, the fear I see
Every day once again in the fight
To be the game of a carnal race

Welcome to the circus of damned
The time of fire proved by their dread
Blood and swords shelter in hell
Look at was we have become

Horror to be nightfall's gloom
For the man upon the ground
Once he starts again
In the circus of the damned
Forgotten on the stony way
Take the sadness of the verve
Welcome again and again
In the circus of the damned
In the circus of the damned

Crawling in the night
Hatred dirty minds
Always hide behind
Will we ever find the life?

Will we ever find?
Will we ever die?

Circus of the damned

Oh
Yeah

Destruction of the fearful man
Lost the race of my kind
Once he starts again
In the circus of the damned
Jokes of war upon the ground
For the viewers of this games
Welcome again and again
In the circus of the damned

Prepare to fight, a line of defense
The chase is on, I walk the dark
Lost all sense, inside of my mind
Slaughter and fear, beyond all evil signs

My hands are soiled, covered in blood
Damnation reach the top of the world
Lamentable souls arrived from the past
I'm on my way to depart from life

Horror to be nightfall's gloom
For the man upon the ground
Once he starts again
In the circus of the damned
Forgotten on the stony way
Take the sadness of the verve

Crawling in the night
Hatred dirty minds
Always hide behind
Will we ever find the life?

Will we ever find?
Will we ever die?
