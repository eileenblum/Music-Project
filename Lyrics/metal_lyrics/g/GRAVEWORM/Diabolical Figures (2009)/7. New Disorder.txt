Defenders fighting, floating blood
Destroy the false and untrue ones
Fight the world on holy ground
Fight the world for God's revenge

The only true and mighty god
Smash their life, no turning back
Fight the world on holy ground
Fight the world for the faith

The only sound I can hear
Is the steel, that I feel
The truth of all religions
Buried on a wall of crime
Approaching from behind
Feel the pain start inside
Waiting in the flashing light
Another soul for senseless war

Steel cries break the silent time
God of war are called to come
Slaying down with faithful strokes
The ground is burning red
Feel the smell of burning flesh
Blows across the open fields
Painful cries of children
And the cold night comes again

The only sound I can hear
Is the steel, that I feel
The truth of all religions
Buried on a wall of crime
Approaching from behind
Feel the pain start inside
Waiting in the flashing light
Another soul for endless war

Raging fury world will bleed
Shake the holy ash in hell
Fight the world on holy ground
Fight the world for God's revenge

The brave and glory lords will call
Leads the legions of the dead
Fight the world on holy ground
Fight the world where it stands

Prepare yourself
Prepare yourself
Prepare yourself
New disorder rise
Destroy your life
Destroy your life
Destroy your world
New disorder fails

New disorder fails

Forlorn faith, damned in hell
Independence breaks for all
Fight the world on holy ground
Fight the world for God's revenge

The mighty doors, the beast outside
With passion, steel and fear
Fight the world on holy ground
Fight the world for false peace
