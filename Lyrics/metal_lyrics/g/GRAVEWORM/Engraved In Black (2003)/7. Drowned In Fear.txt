[Music and Lyrics by Graveworm]

Dark powers manifest
Spiteful horrors crush the sky
Escape from the twilight of a blackened mind
Blood of our enemies
As time shows no change
Embrace by the veil of malicious death
A story told of suffering, blood and pain
Screaming of hate the demons now descend
Smell of dying flowers
Enchanted voices dies
War cry from the darkness, loud and weird
Resistance of mankind
A small flame of hope
Show no mercy, the time has come to fight
The world is dying and here we all die
Screaming, crying, fighting with fear
Into silent shadows
From nowhere to the deep
While the wicked soul are still crying in despair
Children of the night
They shall rise again
Shining like the blood of forgotten unlight
By nocturnal powers fall into the abyss
Slaves of gods - prepare to die
Prepare to die
Darkness hold the secrets of every human fear
Beside the ancient lake - beneath the spelling moon
Prophecies in blood - thunderstorm and rain
Across the field of burial ground
Storm of death swept away defence
Fight for the truth, die for the faith
Damned in fear, fall into the depths
They coming again and again
For victory we ride
Revenge of our land
The time when we will strike back
With swords in our hand
With straight in our heart
Again we march side by side
Remember the last breath
Of killed human friends
Remember the pain in their eyes
For revenge of their life
We fight until the end
With honour and pride we die
