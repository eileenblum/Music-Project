[Music and Lyrics by Graveworm]

Moment of silence - blackened my eyes
Come through your dreams - voices from beyond
Call your name - invoke your pain
Guardian angel sleep - tears in their eyes
Deep from the shadows - the shadows arrives
While the wall of glasses reaches the sky
See the death in your eyes
I feel how my strength is growing
I wait for the dawn to come
The earth of mankind is bleeding
For the last sentence of mortal life
Emptiness, fear and despair
Shadows move where light should be
Feel and see this dying world
Through demon eyes I cry - cry!
Through demon eyes I die - die!
By life betrayed to endless sleep
To live without a dream
Once stands straight with faith and pride
Now drenched in blood I lay
Dark dreams of the past, calling back to me
Shadows that embrace me, with wings of frozen fear
Hear the silent whispers, which makes my dream come true
Feel the darkest velvet, breath between the dreams
When the veil of death covers up your mind
Once again the path of dark painted in blood
Kill or be killed, live for the ancient ones
Guardian angel found their end
As blood rains from the sky
Demons on the ancient world
Sacrifice their soul
Across the waves the dragons fly
Bringing the evil sight
See the fearsome death
Reflecting in your eyes
