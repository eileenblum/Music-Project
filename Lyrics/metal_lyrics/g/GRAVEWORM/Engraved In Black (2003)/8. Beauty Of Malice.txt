[Music and Lyrics by Graveworm]

Turned to the hours of deepest despair
Ancient mystic world surrounds my mind
Hear the sweetest symphonies, betrayed by own dreams
Temptation of the beauty, I have tasted her tears
I've tasted her tears
She filled my dreams, surrounds be her grace
The gift of their life runs slowly through my veins
By darkness seducted, her cold veil of death
Malicious beauty, obsession of my sins
Craving hands crawls in my neck
I reached the throne of death
I kiss and embrace the dreaming
Devils dance by her side
Embrace the flowers of fall
Drops of blood falls from my hand
I hear the song of the dying ones
Rapes my sin of life
I feel the end of life
Your look stained my soul
I see the dance of flames
Losing my existence
I see the darkness falling on my skin
The cold hand of the beauty might
The claws of death crushes my mind
I raise my hands toward the sky
The kiss of my life and the kiss of my death
Embraced by the stigma of her sweetest voice
Bewitched the sense of the faith to my god
Disarmed the fear of all pain have to come
