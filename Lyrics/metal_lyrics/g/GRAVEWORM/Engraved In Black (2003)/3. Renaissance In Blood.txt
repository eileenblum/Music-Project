[Music and Lyrics by Graveworm]

Bleed for the death
From the river of pain
And the stream of fear
Another fight for revenge
Marching to the lines
Buried in dust
Only death remains

Sacrifice, death for human race
The end of all life
Covered in blood
The coming of destruction
Deadly touch of hell
Mist of the dawn
Revel in flesh

A wind of powers blows from the sky
Raging fury, the enemy arrives
Riding straight with hate in their soul
PAIN - Renaissance in blood

Blood will flow, screams in the sky
Fire enlightens the blackest night
The gates of the damned opened their arms
DIE - Renaissance in blood

Bleed for the death
From the river of pain
And the stream of fear
Another fight for revenge
Marching to the lines
Buried in dust
Only death remains

Sacrifice, death for human race
The end of all life
Covered in blood
The coming of destruction
Deadly touch of hell
Mist of the dawn
Revel in flesh

A field of frozen tears remains
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
The storm of death screams for revenge
FEAR - Renaissance in blood

Shadows and dust lies on the ground
Across the sky they are flying high
And soon the world will cease to be
DIE - Renaissance in blood
