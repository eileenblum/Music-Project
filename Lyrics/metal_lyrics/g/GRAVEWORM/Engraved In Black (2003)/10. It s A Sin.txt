[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

[Pet Shop Boys Cover]

As I look back upon my life..
it's always with a sense of shame..
I've always been the one to blame...

For everything I long to do..
No matter when or where or who..
Has one thing in common too..

It's a.. it's a.. it's a.... it's a sin....

It's a sin..

My father taught me how to be
So pure of thought.. and word and deed..
He didn't quite succeed........

For everything I long to do..
No matter when or where or who..
Has one thing in common too..

It's a.. it's a.. it's a....... it's a sin...

Everything I've ever done..
Everything I'll ever do
Everyplace I've ever been..
Everywhere I'm going to........

It's a sin.....

Father forgive me...
I tried not to do it....
Turned over a new leaf...
Then tore right through it...
Whatever you taught me...
I didn't believe it...
Father you fought me..
Cause I didn't care.. and I still don't.. understand.......

Now as I look back upon my life..
It's always with a sense of shame..
I've always been the one to blame..

For everything I long to do..
No matter when or where or who..
Has one thing in common too..

It's a.. it's a.. it's a......... it's a sin...

It's a sin....

Everything I've ever done..
Everything I'll ever do..
Every place I've ever been..
Everywhere I'm going to.....

It's a sin...

It's a sin...
