[Music: Orgler, Mair / Lyrics: Graveworm]

Loose your life by manipulation
Slept away by another frustration
The simply truth I fear is here
Dying in its sleep

They called my name, I bled for life
Hear them cry again
The blood has left me cold inside
Time will tell the truth of life

It's time to die another way
The way of suicide
Slowly floating poison
The perfect day for my final time

[Pre-Chorus]
I kill for hate of your preacher and leaders
The hopes and prays of all blindly believers
Nothing betray a weakness
Lost in the scars of sorrow

Die with their lies of justice and squerness
Betrayed by the tyrants, destroyed by your master
They will take your soul apart
And let you burn in hell

[Chorus]
Hate ... is what I feel
Fear ... deep in me
Death ... so cold and quiet
Love ... will never die

Hate ... is what I feel
Fear ... deep in me
Death ... so cold and quiet
Enter ... suicide code

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

As they all close their eyes
The dark turned off the light
They turned me into dead
I learned to hate the people
I never thought I would be there (again)
A life joke, just senseless
I feel my life goes away
I fear as I saw this end
