[Music: Orgler, Righi, Mair / Lyrics: Graveworm]

I'll break you down a thousand smiles
Die with their raging hate
Close your eyes and wait to die
Take your fucking life away

Searching, crying, breathing the death
As the life starts fading away
Pictures of the dead appears
Deep within my mind
Praying helpless, screaming of pain
As I ride to hopeless lies
With blood in your hands - I cry

I don't know what you are looking for
I don't know why you cry for more
Your heart has ever ceased to be
I don't know what you are looking for
I don't know why you cry for more
You close your eyes and start to die

The fury of your hate I feel
Your hands are soiled, covered in blood
Take my life and take my soul
I dwell in emptiness
Release my blood and fade away
Take control of my mind
I'm not afraid to die
As my life was built on a thousand lies
