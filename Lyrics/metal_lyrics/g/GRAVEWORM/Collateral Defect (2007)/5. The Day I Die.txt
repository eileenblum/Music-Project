[Music: Orgler, Mair / Lyrics: Graveworm]

Haunted by the power
The obsession in my mind
Voices from the darkside
Call the dead to reach the grave

Crying for existence
Visions of a dying world
Is it true or still a dream
The daylight race to leave behind

[Chorus]
I can see what you see
I can feel what you feel
The day I die

I can hear what you hear
I can dream what you dream
The day I die

The day I die

Absence of redemption
Breathing out the frames of dust
(Be) a part of this essential war
The darkness of thy soul

Feel the deadly poison
No more opposition
Blackness in my mind sublime
Prepare - the day I die

The day I die

You can't kill my body
A part of your existence
Dwells within our heart
Feelings of our free divine

Step inside this circle
Your love will turn into hate
Join my evil forces
Feel the new connection

[Chorus 2x]

I can see it in your dreams
