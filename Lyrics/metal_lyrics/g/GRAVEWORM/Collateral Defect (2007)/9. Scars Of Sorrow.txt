[Music: Flarer, Graveworm / Lyrics: Graveworm]

Blackness inside, what you say (I) have to do
The man of the dead is coming to you
Lies of redemption cleanse me out of sins
Trapped in a lie of evil skins

Hear my warnings, fear your existence
Lost in an ancient mystery
Daylight breaks as blood falls down
Assassins of human history

Bound in a dream
A prisoner of hate
Bound in hell
There's no escape

Bound in a dream
A prisoner of hate
Bound in hell
There's no escape

Deceive my senses, learn from the past
I was thrown to the ground
Fear the disaster, wallow in darkness
Swept aside by my hate

Darkness light obscure my mind
Depths of clarity are mine
Whispers consume the air
Once again I feel my mistakes
All in the hands of energy
Nothing like before
The last piece of breath
End is here like a joke of life

Deceive my senses, learn from the past
I was thrown to the ground
Fear the disaster, wallow in darkness
Swept aside by my hate

Hear my warnings, fear your existence
Lost in an ancient mystery
Daylight breaks as blood falls down
Assassins of human history
