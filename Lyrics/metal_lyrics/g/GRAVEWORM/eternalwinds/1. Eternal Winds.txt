[Music by Unterpertinger, Mair]
[Lyrics by Fiori]

As I saw the world in flames 
Though the eyes of eternal life 
I wish to destroy the life 
For every innocent cry 

As a sign to die 

As I see the mistakes of man 
I feel my anger 
God will make the end of time 
You cry forever 

I cry - I saw 
Eternal, eternal winds 
Eternal, eternal winds 
Eternal, eternal winds 
Eternal, eternal winds 

Your voice screams like 
The rain from sky 
The end of time has come 
Neither time nor a sign 
Can stop this cicle of death 

Lost in your self there's no way to get out 
The world is burning bright 
Nothingness before the end 
Unreality of fear 

A prophecy 
Is on the sky 
Obscurity 
Over the world 

I cry - I saw 
Eternal, eternal winds 
Eternal, eternal winds 
Eternal, eternal winds 
Eternal, eternal winds 

An imagine of total devastion 
Characterize the world of today
