So many roads - so many places
A million towns - a milliard faces
It's called: world population
But the appropriate name - world domination
Can someone help me?
Who should I call?

In such time, guns are friends
Never ever you see shaking hands
Even childs are making war
So called freedom is away so far
Can someone help me?
Who should I call?

[Chorus]
I want escape, I wanna fly,
I wanna breath, I wanna cry,
I'll kill myself therefore and so,
I wanna know, where I should go!

Can someone help me?
Who should I call?
The population - is gonna fall

I'm asking - for deliverance
Suggest - I wait for a wise sentence
