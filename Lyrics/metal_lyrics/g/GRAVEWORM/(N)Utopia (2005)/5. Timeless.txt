Forget the time, forget this place
'cause we are here to damage your face
Just close your eyes
Across the ocean, across the land
Mysterious things, and the name of a band
Just close your eyes and give me your hand

[Chorus]
Are you ready? Are you ready?
To hear this song, for so long?
This is our time - believe in me
We're playing you feel free

You hear us everywhere - near and far
In the galaxy - on every star
Just close your eyes
Ready to rumble, ready to crash
Today we're gonna smash
Just close your eyes and give me your hand

[Chorus]

Give me your faith!

[Chorus]
