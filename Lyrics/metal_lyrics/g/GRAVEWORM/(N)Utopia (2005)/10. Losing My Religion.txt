[R.E.M. cover]

Oh life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you crying
I thought that I heard you Scream
I think I thought I saw you Die

Every whisper of
Every waking moment I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep
An eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip
That brought me to my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you Crying
I thought that I heard you Scream
I think I thought I saw you Die

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
But I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you Crying
I thought that I heard you Scream
I think I thought I saw you Die

But that was just a dream
Die Cry Why Die
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream
Dream
