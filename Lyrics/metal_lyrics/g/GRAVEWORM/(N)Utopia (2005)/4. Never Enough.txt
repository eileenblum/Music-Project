1, 2, 3, 4!
Stop command!!!

I feel so sick inside
Unused your human mind
Untrue is that you see outside
I knock you out!

You never said: ''I'm sorry!''
You've never been a friend,
Important four you success and money
Stop command!!!

The job your family
The sad cruelty
No conversation
No explanation

[Chorus]
Even not rich enough
No place for feelings and stupid stuff
Less - I love you
Just more - I hate you
You blind bastard
When did you sell your heart

Don't tell us bullshit
Don't tell us lies
In your part you failed
What you mean? Stop!!!

[Chorus]

1, 2, 3, 4
Stop command!!!

[Chorus]

1, 2, 3, 4
Stop command!!!

Stop!
