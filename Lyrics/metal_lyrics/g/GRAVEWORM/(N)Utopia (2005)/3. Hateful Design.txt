Confessions of your mind
After thousand days of killing
Death was my life and pain where my thoughts
Pleasure of the death, there is no regret
Boiling in my veins

Another death - another lust
In my eyes there is something wrong
Another life - another soul
Nobody gives a damn

The plague will unleashed and the race will begun
Run for desire for the lust to die
The innocent souls and the smell in the air
Killing - raping - destroying of souls

Watch them cross the line of life
Do not feel the pain inside
Emotions are gone every breath he takes
Take control of their essence of life

[Chorus]
Bloodred face of lust
Take the chance, do it again
Screaming out for blood
Silence on the overground
Calling the death
Mortals have ceased to be
Motionless stand afraid
One more time my hateful design

Carnal desires the treasure to survive
Watching out for victims, visions of a dying world
Screaming bodies surrounded by pain
The neverending ritual will always go on

Once again - another fight
You choose your way to die
Another time - another friend
Let the show start again!

[Chorus]

My hateful design
