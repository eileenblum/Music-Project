Invocation - the blood peers through my veins
I cannot see the face of eyeless hell
Invocation - for the knowledge of the cold
Dark and grey - like a machine

Insanity became reality
All fragments endes, embracing time
Releasing shadows as it stops to flow
And slain an amusing lifeless curse

[Chorus]
My arms are getting colder
It comes over my shoulder
Something I've never seen
I'm getting to be a machine
My blood stops to flow
My hand - an iron glove
I change my be
I wouldn't be a machine

Incarnation - of a further level n fear
A gracious lefe betrayed by an energetic stream
Incarnation - by powers of the unknown might
The evolution of the human race

Insanity became reality
All fragments endes, embracing time
Releasing shadows as it stops to flow
And slain an amusing lifeless curse

[Chorus]
Disinfection of information
Instruction failed
Perhaps, maybe, align

[Chorus]
