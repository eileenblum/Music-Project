Sometimes the shadows
Come to life these walls
Fade before your eyes
Enter a distant realm of
Abnormalities we had the
Same dream only I believe

We belong in the unknown
We belong to fear
For we know
Our time is yet to come
At sunset we will learn
To rise again

One day the dead will come
To life marching on
Black masses every night
