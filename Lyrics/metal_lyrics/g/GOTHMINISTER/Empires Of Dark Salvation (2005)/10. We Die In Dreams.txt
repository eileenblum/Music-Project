She casts no shadow in the streets of the dead machines
and ruined children are the angels in our dreams

And these are changes in a world she used to know
She found redemption in a past that came undone
We are all on our way to damnation
If we die in dreams we die for real

Empty faces, blind and grim black hearts wonât pity sin cold breath,
endless quest for
Sanity in demons nest
He who sees her watches her fall
Yet heâs the blindest of them all
He couldnât hear he couldnât feel
The darkest call from those who bleed
