Why do you believe in monsters?
We have been locked up in this evil house
It is where you live with your wicked monsters
We are the prisoners of death and decay
It is where you live, but your dreams betray

You are brave, to feel save
In a mean caress
You are gone, youâre the one
We are praying for you

Why do you believe in hell?
Why do you believe in love divine?
In your dark and twisted mind

And with the force of any evil spell
Repulsive hymns will unleash the creatures
Disturbing images of decadence
Where is the beauty between the devils hands?
