If we died tonight
Would it ever be the same
If itâs over now
Would I comfort you again
If thereâs no return
From the realm of blackened wings
If thereâs no release
From the pain you feel within

You stop the world for a while
The weight upon your shoulders scraping off
Reflective eyes of a child
And the creatures stretch their arms
To the sky

If we die died tonight
Would it ever be the same
If itâs over now
Would I comfort you again
If thereâs no return
To the sting that makes you real
Then should everyone
Always fear their inner dreams?

If we died tonight
Weâve lost control of what is real
In the fear of night
Only children learn to breathe
