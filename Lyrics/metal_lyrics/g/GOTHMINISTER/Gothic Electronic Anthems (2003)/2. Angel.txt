These wings won't learn to rise
In the pale and wicked light beneath the skies
Broken, blinded, you are paralysed
You belong to them who believe they'll be denied

Take my hand just to be my love
The time has come to rise above
The angel now has broken wings
And something to obtain
The day the sun just went away

You're shivering in the dark
When you feel it's coming closer every time
Now the mentor is calling you
Can't you see the flames beyond your fading eyes

Take my hand just to be my love
Be my love just to be the one
