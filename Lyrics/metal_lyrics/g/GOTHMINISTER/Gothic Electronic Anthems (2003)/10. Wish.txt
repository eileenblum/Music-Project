I've been away for a while now
I have been gone in myself
Time has deranged my emotions
And I, I have fought against my hell

Do you wish to be invincible
Do you wish to rule the world
Long before you even think of this
You must learn to rule yourself

I've been afraid of the outside
I am so safe here alone
Life has become my own cell now
Before I leave I just want you to know
