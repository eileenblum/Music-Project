We couldn't realise how far
They would go this time
An unforeseen future is
What we must deny
It doesn't matter if it's
Coming the right way out
When we are sinking to
The bottom line
My mind is slipping
My mind is slipping away
And I'm left alone in shame

I'm coming
I'm coming alone
Last man standing in
The fields of scorn.
So come on

My mind is slipping
My mind is slipping away
And I'm left alone in shame

I'm coming
I'm coming alone
I'm burning
Until I'm gone

Last man standing in
The fields of scorn
Last man standing in
The fields of scorn
Last man standing in
The fields I was born
So come on
