Force out the demons inside
Wake up the evilness
A blood streaming bride
You're standing at the gates of fear
Let yourself crucify
In time for the scare

What if I could be your God
What if I could steal your soul
So come on and let me know
Let me know when you're alone

Bring out the beast in your mind
You are abandoned now
Left here to die
I am your eyes ï¿½cause you're blind
And when you're waking up

Your dream is alive
