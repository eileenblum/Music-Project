Another day another
Face it didn't mean
Anything
It shouldn't happen
This way
Could you neglect to
Show respect and price
Your advice you give
Our kingdom a name

But now you started
The fire maybe
It cannot lead to no good
And now it doesn't seem
Right that we shall
Obey well can't you feel
It too

It's the time it's the place
It's the way we are made
But you never tried to be
The holy one
You will not feel how good
It tastes
This is here this is now
It's the way we go blind
But you will never
Be the right for the
If lack of values
Leads to waste

The burning wheel is rolling faster
I know I feel it's coming now
ï¿½cause any day you will have to see it
Wake up it's real and it's loud
