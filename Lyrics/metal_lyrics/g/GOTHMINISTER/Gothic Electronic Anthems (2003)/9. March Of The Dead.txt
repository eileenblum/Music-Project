Could it be that you're feeling down again
Could it be that you're crawling faster
Can you bring back the dead
You are seeing the visions from the past
You are here to join us soon
And make it forever last

We are so beautiful
We are so cold
One day you'll join us
Or you will forever long

Could it be that wanna go before
Could it be that you love the thought
Of not being anymore
If you dare come and watch the sight
Of a crowd immortalised
Marching in the night
