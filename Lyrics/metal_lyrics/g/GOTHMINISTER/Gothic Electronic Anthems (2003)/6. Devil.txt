Hey Devil what is your plan today
I didn't know that it would be like this
Hey Devil is it never enough for you
Or won't you quit until I'm on my knees

You make it really hurt when everything is doomed
And there's no salvation
I knew a man who lived two thousand years on your lies

Meet the Devil living on the edge of any pain
I didn't know it felt so good to hurt you
The fear is growing stronger
Though you're only half way through the game
When love is dead I'll call for you
The devil

Hey Devil am I the chosen one
`Cause if I am I think I know the truth
Hey would you enjoy if fanatics won
Without religion you would be no use
