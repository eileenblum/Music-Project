They tried to tell you not to listen
They tried to make you understand
They wanted you to be like the masses
They wanted you to be an average man

But now the dark has got you taken
And now the light no longer exists
You feel the pain is growing stronger
Now what you need is an exorcist

I pray for you
For you are not the same
I pray for you
Tomorrow is your day

They tried to tell you not to listen
They tried to make you understand
They wanted you to be like the masses
But now the darkness has changed your plans

You have become the man they fear now
You have been out there in the mist
You feel the pain is growing stronger
Now what you need is an exorcist
