In the shadows of evil
Sins cries a little child
She is drawing forbidden things
From the dark side of her mind
She belongs to a different world
A world that is filled with love
Nothing could ever make her sleep
`Cause soon she will have to go
Away

In the shadows of evil
Sins cries a little child
She is waiting for the magic strings

When will they take
Her to the other side

They told her not to be afraid
Of the beasts under her bed
They have become her only friends
Living inside of her head

In the shadows of evil
Sins cries a little child

She is dreaming of her world
Yet still her eyes are open wide

She would dive into the open arms
Of her mentor with the cane
Although she knows she will leave anyway
This will neither be the way
