Where no-one knows you
Don't bore them with your defense now
Where no-one knows you
The time has come to realise
That no-one wants you
You don't have any friends here
'Cause no-one knows you
You fade into the dust and find

Darkness
Is all that I want tonight
You save me every time
Darkness
Is all that I want for life
You saved my life tonight

Where no-one knows you
Don't bore them with your defense now
You know you're an outcast
The time has come to roll the dice
But why would it change them
They choose to live life in shallowness
Blind as bats
One day they might realise

Darkness
Is all that I want tonight
You save me every time
Darkness
Is all that I want for life
You save my life tonight

Darkness

Where no-one knows you
Don't bore them with your defense now
Where no-one knows you
The time has come to realise
That no-one wants you
You don't have any friends here
'Cause no-one knows you
You fade into the dust and find
