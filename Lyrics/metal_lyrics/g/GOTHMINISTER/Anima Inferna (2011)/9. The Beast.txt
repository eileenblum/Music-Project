Beyond the valley
Of faded grey souls
The trees lay dead
In the forrest where no-one goes
The beast is served
Hell opens the gate
A stench fills the air
And the sky's painted red

Bring on the pain and the creeping death
You steal their hopes, lead a madness quest
You've got a taste for extinction of the mind
Don't you understand?

You bring them down, leave them there to rot
Banish the weak, and then drown the lot
Keep them alive, till their dreams
are all buried and gone
Don't you understand?

Don't you understand?
Need you once again
Until you bleed
This time

They live a life in the world of death
Dreams of the future is all they got
But now their dreams are slowly dying too
Don't you understand?

I'm just like you, I'm the under-god
Deep in the dark will my kingdom come
I am the beast you created
I'm your nemesis
Don't you understand?

Don't you understand?
Need you once again
Until you bleed
This time

The beast is calling, it's seeking the light
The beast is calling, it feeds on your life
The beast is calling, it's seeking the light
The beast is calling, it feeds on your life

The beast
Don't you understand?
