You bring me to my knees
This is the holy system
No evolution
And God created all

I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is the one I love
I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is inside

Fight
Revenge
It's not too late to realise
Angels 
Will get sacrificed
Fight
Resist
We cannot all be crucified
Angels
Know it's justified

You forced it upon me
The beauty of fanatism
Now it's all twisted
'Cause I've become the beast

I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is the one I love
I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is inside

Fight
Revenge
It's not too late to realise
Angels 
Will get sacrificed
Fight
Resist
We cannot all be crucified
Angels
Know it's justified

Fight
Revenge
Resist
All fanatics

Fight
Revenge
Resist
Those who feed on the blind

Fight

Fight
Revenge
It's not too late to realise
Angels 
Will get sacrificed
Fight
Resist
We cannot all be crucified
Angels
Know it's justified

Angels
Know it's justified
