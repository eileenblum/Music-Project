Sometimes the living get mixed up with the dead
Sometimes the two worlds are connecting in our heads
We want to know about the images we see
Where lies the passage to our darkest fantasy

Rest
Stonehenge
Rest
Rest in peace

Breathe
Undead
Breathe
Are you coming for me

Lifeless
It's how I'd feel if I would be without you
Lifeless
I cannot feed I cannot breathe without you

Who was the man I met in mirrors everyday
He didn't look like had come here to stay
The world is full of psychic hypnotic creeps
Whatever you do just don't fall asleep

Rest
Stonehenge
Rest
Rest in peace

Breathe
Undead
Breathe
Are you just like me

Lifeless
It's how I'd feel if I would be without you
Lifeless
I cannot feed I cannot breathe without you

Is this the feeling I've been dreaming of
I've never ever felt alive before
I couldn't see it, it came from miles away

Is this the feeling I've been searching for
I'm never ever gonna ask for more
'Cause now I've found it and now we're here to stay

The demons are crawling away
The underworld has left them behind
From a distance you hear them moaning now
Like plagued creatures of the night at sunrise

Lifeless
Lifeless

Is this the feeling I've been dreaming of
I've never ever felt alive before
I couldn't see it, it came from miles away

Is this the feeling I've been searching for
I'm never ever gonna ask for more
'Cause now I've found you and now we're here to stay
