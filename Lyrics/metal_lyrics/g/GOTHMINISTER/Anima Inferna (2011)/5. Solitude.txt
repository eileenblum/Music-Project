A faint shadow in the corner of your eye
A pale reflection, was there something passing by?
Night, cool air has brought with it the sneaking mist
You walk in solitude, be careful what you wish for

With a desire that is stronger than death
A sense of awe that you will never forget
Blood runs cold through veins of dreadful memories
Return of disorder, enter true insanity

You are the one that he cannot resist
He will be roaming through the shadows and mist
For his love of a lifetime
You are the one that he cannot resist
Tonight, tonight

You feel the weakness and you have to obey
An ancient spell born deep beyond the cold grave
All beauty, innocence, once has to fade
Prolong existence and give all that he craves

You are the one that he cannot resist
Tonight, tonight

You breathe the darkness, it's got to be nice
You seek his power, so there's no need to fight
Even eternity needs blood in it's veins
'Cause when you wake up it will start all over again

You are the one that he cannot resist
He will be roaming through the shadows and mist
For his love of a lifetime

You are the one that he cannot resist
He will be roaming through the shadows and mist
For his love of a lifetime

You are the one that he cannot resist
Tonight, tonight
