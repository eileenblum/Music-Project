The light disappears
And your faith is now sealed
When the final deed is done

Shed the blood for the
Almighty Goat Footed God
Will he now bring you home?

Can I save you from the torment in your mind
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine

With seven horns and seven eyes
The dark will find its sacrifice
And it's too late to realize you did it all
I can't undo what you have done
But I am righteously the one
To make you understand that anyone can fall

Can I save you from the torment in your mind
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine

Can I save you from the evilness you need
Can I teach you about the power 616

Can I save you from the torment in your mind (Six sixteen)
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine (Six sixteen)

It is time to lock up your world and enter mine

It's a dark day for evilness
I can't save you if you can't save yourself
