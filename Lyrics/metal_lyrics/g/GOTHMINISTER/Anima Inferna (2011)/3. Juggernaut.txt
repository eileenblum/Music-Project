Silent hands
Crush you down
Beat you up
You hit the ground

Silent hands
Break your neck
Tear you apart
Until you die

Do you wanna be another believer
Do you wanna be alone and forlorn
Are you gonna take the charge of your own life
And start to fight back against invisible forces

Silent hands are feeling nothing
Once again you fall apart
Silent hands are afraid of something
In the end you'll tell them why

Silent hands
Break your bones
Mess you up
You stand your ground

Do you wanna be another believer
Do you wanna be another lost soul
Are you gonna take the charge of your own life
And start to fight back against invisible forces

Silent hands are feeling nothing
Once again you fall apart
Silent hands are afraid of something
In the end you'll tell them why

"Can't you see I'm the one
Can't you see it's not forgotten
I will live another day
Let my shadow lead the way"

Do you wanna be another believer
Do you wanna be alone and forlorn
Are you gonna take the charge of your own life
And start to fight back against invisible forces

Hear me
Won't you hear me now
Hear me
Won't you hear me now

Life can bring you down
I know you're suffering in your hell
But you will get around
Just remember one last thing
Life lies
