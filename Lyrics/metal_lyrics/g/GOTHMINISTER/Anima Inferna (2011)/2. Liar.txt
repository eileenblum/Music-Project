Liar - do you believe in the future
Or do you feel lost in the vortex of nightmares
Liar - I can sense your affection
In whats been feeding on the lies and redemption

You made your bed on the throne of deception
Back then your destiny was never a question
But now I stand here with you faith in my hands
Well do you fear my revenge
Do you fear I'll deceive you

Liar - in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar - can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight

Can you breathe the filthy air, so tell me how it feels
Can you learn to love someone if you cant see what is real
Can you feel the burning fear that tears you up inside
And you don't sleep at night 'cause creatures disembowel all your dreams

Liar - in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar - can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight

Well I don't want you and I don't need you

You made your bed on the throne of deception
Back then your destiny was never a question

Liar - in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar - can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died

Liar - in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar - can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight
