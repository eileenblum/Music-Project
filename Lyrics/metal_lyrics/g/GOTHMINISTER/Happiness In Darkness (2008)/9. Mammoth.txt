A fallen angel
Broken inside
The old estate lies
Broken in time

Crawling maggots
Itching in your mind
Beneath the walls
The dead skin rise
Like a twisted from a sky painted red
A tall dark shadow dancing with the dead

Don't you fear to close your eyes
The worms are crawling, feeding beneath the ground
You fear to leave the night
But the minister will watch over your soul

Enter the fortress
Lurking around
Will it ever happen
What we have found

Don't you fear to close your eyes
The worms are crawling, breeding beneath the ground
You fear to leave the night
But the minister will watch over your soul

Crawling maggots
Itching in your mind
As a reminder
Of two of a kind
Like an angel and a devil in red
Two tall dark shadows dancing with the dead
