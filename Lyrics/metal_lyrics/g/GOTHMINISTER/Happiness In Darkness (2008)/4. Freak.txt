Once enchanted by your gloomy presence
Did that belong to a different world
All broken down by your feigned contrition
Could never drown, but will become
A witch that burns

You're such a freak
So I fall apart

I caught you shining on the first encounter
But now I know it was the perfect crime;
To gain a heart, and twist it into pieces
And in return, leave the words that never die;

You're such a freak
You turn back the time
You stopped pretending
That the dream wasn't meant to die
It's just a wicked world, and
I ain't gonna need another way to lead this life again, choose another end
It's just a blackened world, so
I don't wanna live without you by my side, in your spiritistic ways

You're such a freak
So I fall apart
In times of faith
You turn back the tide
You stopped pretending
That the dream wasn't meant to die
