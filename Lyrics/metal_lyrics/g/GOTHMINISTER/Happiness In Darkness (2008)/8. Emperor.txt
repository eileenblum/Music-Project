Can you feel it coming
I said to you it was
Can you see them burning
The bridges and the cross
All that's left are pieces
But we're not the same
Could it be that nothing remains?

Can you leave me like you do
In your eyes there's something precious
Can you leave me now, can you?
In your eyes there's something bright
That's lost behind

Can you feel it fading
Breaking up at last
Can you hear the whispering
Of death to our past
We knew this would happen
Was written in the books
Could it be that something remains?

Take a look around you
The war is gone
And you're the one now
Take a look around you
The game is won but you're alone now

Can you feel it coming
I said to you it was
Can you see them burning
The bridges and the cross
All that's left are pieces
And we're not the same
But the memories will remain
