Creepy freaks that I used to mock
They took revenge, I woke up in a shock
I'm one of them now
My limbs are gone
And my eyes turned inside out

I'm on a sideshow
So won't you please leave me alone
I'm on a sideshow
Just take a peek and then be gone
I hope you'll like tonight's show
It's a frightshow

I'm on a sideshow
I'm screaming please leave me alone
I'm on a sideshow
Just take a peek and then be gone
I hope you'll like tonight's show
It's a frightshow

A rising star in this hell on wheels
It's so repellent, now it's my life for real
I comprehend now;
My head's on a stake
And my eyes are open wide

You always fear what you can't relate to
But every night I hear screams they've made me
One of them now
My own aversion has become my family

It is all a mistake now;
I'm not your animal
I've seen all the ''Single O's''
And I know I don't belong
''They will love you in the end
They will treat you like a friend''
Will I end my days, on this carnival?

Sideshow, you know I'll stay in here forever
