We're dancing around the fire in black masses
We're dancing while the devil spread his wings
We fill our lives with death so unlike the others
But in the end we were the ones who lived

There's beauty after midnight, you'll see
The wicked come to me
We're burning after midnight, the dark
Will feed our blackened hearts

We're dancing like pure immortals after sundown
We're moving like we all do belong in hell
We fill our lives with death so unlike the others
But in the end we will be the ones to tell:

So let the dark embrace us
We're gonna stay here for a while
Until the horned king kills the lights

We're dancing around the fire in black masses
we're dancing while the devil spreads his wings
The darkness is for ignorant pretenders
The beauty in it is for queens and kings
