You wanna run like hell
To the beating drum
For this is no good place to die
You see that
Nothing here is motionless
'Cause all your fears are out tonight

I'm here to be your saviour
And take it all
Be your saviour
Won't let you fall

This is what you get
For not listening
Now the underground is at war
Haunted beings in robes of sorrow
As you have never ever seen before

I'm here to be your saviour
Answer your call

This is the only secret
To why you feel this plague
Believe in God and in Hell?
You'll have faith in yourself
I'm here to start your fire and embrace your soul
We save the fallen angels
Make you face what you can't ignore
We save the fallen angels
I'm here to be your saviour
Answer your call
There is but one; your saviour
