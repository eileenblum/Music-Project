Oblivious is forlorn
I'm back in this hole
Rotten, dead and freezing cold
I'm a freezed rat playing my role
For a fight to hell
You're taunted well
If we told them all
They are not all our fault
Not easy to breed
The glimpse i can see
What is waiting for me
When the wicked one screams

Horrorshow
It's gonna drain your soul

There is a horrorshow
Where ever you go
It's gonna rip your soul
And break your bones

I'm on my way
The burgatory way
My time is running out
The stench of death leave no doubt

For a fight to hell
You're taunted well
If we told them all
They are not all our fault
Not easy to breed
The glimpse i can see
What is waiting for me
When the wicked one screams

Horrorshow
It's gonna drain your soul

There is a horrorshow
Where ever you go
It's gonna rip your soul
And break your bones

Tonight the havoc starts
The earth shakes, we're all terrified
If God had had a plan for us he wouldn't have left us here to rot
Tonight it all begins
Life will lose, and death will win
But some of us can't agree with the curse of God and his demon seed

So we will deny them the joy of
As the ungodly creatures we are Horrorshow
It's gonna drain your soul
There is a horror show
Wherever you go
It's gonna rip your soul
And break your bones
Horrorshow
Horrorshow
