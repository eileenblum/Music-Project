Half awake, I cannot sleep
I'm longing now to rest
Inside my own realm of dreams
Then of ugly skin and bones he suddenly appears
A tall shadow growing out of green mist

I'm scared that i can't breath
Can't they leave me be?

So don't you know that someone is after me
The bringers of pain they drive me insane
Oh, why don't you know that someone is after me
They're inside my head
And they try to break me once again


I, the creature they all fear,
Makes children disappear
This will be a long and frightening year
A daunting bell is heard
I close my eyes and turn
I draw the curtains and kill the lights
"Orphaned child
You little creep
Say your prayers
And we'll make you sleep"

I'm scared cos' i can see where they taking me
So don't you know that someone is after me
The bringers of pain they drive me insane
Why don't you know that someone is after me
They're inside my head
And they try to break me once again

So don't you know that someone is after me
The bringers of pain they drive me insane
Oh, why don't you know that someone is after me
They're inside my head
And they try to break me once again
