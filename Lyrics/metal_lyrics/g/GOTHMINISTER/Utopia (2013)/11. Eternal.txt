The old world is filling up with vermin
The maggots, the dark ones are here
We all have come to the end of what's been started
We have come here to conquer, to create
The new world
Is this the place I've been longing to call my own
The victims who are lost and found, lie naked, scattered, on the ground
In the new world

The fate and belief has brought us here
And one by one we will obey
So please now, relieve us from our misery
The master will show us the way

Is this the place I've been longing to call my own
The empire of the lost and found will rise up from the ground
Is this the place I've been longing to call my own
As peace resides in my black soul, eternity is won
We will be eternal!
"So you are going to end your life so you can resurrect like the Demon of Christ"
