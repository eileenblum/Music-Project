Sirens awaking you now from your sleep
Creatures are crawling, but you're to blind to see
Demons are pulling and grabbing your feet
Whoever you wanna turn to, is gonna tell you that you're in for defeat

United we stand
Until the very end
We only live to see our
Darkest day
Come take my hand
And you're on your way
Tell me what the afterlife will bring

Outlander, who are you, a foe or a friend?
Your life, as you know it, will come to an end
Far away voices, are they telling lies?
A tale of a human being, entering the afterlife

United we stand
Until the very end
We only live to see our
Darkest day
Come take my hand
And you're on your way
Tell me what die afterlife will bring

Fly over the trees and mountains
Float away on firm wings through red skies
On your way to somewhere far beyond the light
Soar above the sky
Disappear into the night
On your way
To somewhere deep inside, your own absent mind

United we stand
Until the very end
We only live to see our
Darkest day
Come take my hand
And you're on your way
Tell me what the afterlife will bring

United we stand
Until the very end
We only live to see
To see our darkest day
"Then comes the greatest of fears:
There is an end to everything...
