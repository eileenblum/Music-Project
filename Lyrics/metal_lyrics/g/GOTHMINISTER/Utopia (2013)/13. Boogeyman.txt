Death is coming
It's coming fast
It's got a thousand faces
Behind the dead skin mask

Death is coming
I am inviting it now
I've got a thousand reasons
And I am prepared to die

If darkness comes my friend
With no salvation
We cannot live forever
Nothing can be done

Death is coming
It's coming fast
It's got a thousand faces
Behind the dead skin mask

Life is a curse my friend
Our days are like a fading shadow
So maybe this world is
Much better off without
The two of us

Death is coming fast

When darkness comes my friend
Will we find salvation?
This evilness can't live forever
It must come to an end
But then the day might come
When Hell floats over
I've had a dream since bitch
That the dead shall reign the Earth
Death is coming
It's coming fast
Death is coming
Death is coming
NOW!
