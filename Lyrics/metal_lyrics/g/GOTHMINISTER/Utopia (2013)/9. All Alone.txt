Everyone is dead now
I'm all alone
Can you feel the silence
Before the storm

I thought that i can trick them,
scare them really good before dawn
But how can i impress when they are dead and my below

Everyone is dead now and we are all alone
How can i apologize if everyone is gone
I'm wishing a miracle come back to life my friends
So we all can have a laugh and i can scare you once again

A mechanical and paralyzed entity appears
It is forlorn in this obnoxious scary world
So save this child
For it is trapped behind the wooden doors
Persecuted by its mother
Recreating hell with her black and foaming mouth
Like a hell demon...
