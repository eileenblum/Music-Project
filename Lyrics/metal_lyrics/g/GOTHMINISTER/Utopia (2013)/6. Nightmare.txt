When I was a child, I used to live across the street
From here, on those sleepless nights a faint bell and
A harsh cough filled the air
Nothing will remain
He will ease you from your pain
If you shall reign this world
Embrace your nightmare

They said he once rose from the earth
To help people die, to resurrect and join his
Army of walking undead
He will release you from your pain
If you shall get your revenge in the end

He was a lunatic from my worst nightmares
They said he used to lure sleepless and unaware children
And in his dark cellar he would end their lives
Consume their brains, and thus reconquer the ability of being creative again
And to live happily as only a child can, in it's pathetic fantasy world

On Sunday nights I often walk pass that old house, where I used to live as a child
Last night, when I passed the house, I heard a faint sound of a bell in the wind
I was wondering if others also could hear it, that bell, and my harsh, nagging cough
that I can't get rid of
