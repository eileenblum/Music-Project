Utopia, Utopia
In the distance you not forgotten
Utopia, Utopia
Is the place you never seen before

Time will turn our prophecies
In to the reality lead the world astray
Utopia, Utopia
trough the half life we're coming down your way

And we, we are making history
The greatest things are yet to be seen
The everlasting search for Utopia

I believe there always will be you and me
Never mind the pain and misery
Tonight, right here, right now is my Utopia

Utopia, Utopia
And the darkness shall unite us
Utopia, Utopia
And the hell only excess your nerve
Bring the crucifix for protection
For the dead we always travel fast
Utopia, Utopia
Lost for centuries found at last

And we, we are making history
The greatest things are yet to be seen
The everlasting search for Utopia

I believe there always will be you and me
Never mind the pain and misery
Tonight, right here, right now is my Utopia

I'm looking at your face
But nothing can be said
Except everyone should have
The right to raise the dead

In my Utopia, Utopia

And we, we are making history
The greatest things are yet to be seen
The everlasting search for Utopia

I believe there always will be you and me
Never mind the pain and misery
Tonight, right here, right now is my Utopia
