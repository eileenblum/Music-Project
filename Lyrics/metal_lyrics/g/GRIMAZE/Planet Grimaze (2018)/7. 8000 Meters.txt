Returning to the origin
Where the atoms of my being came to existence
In harsh and extreme conditions
Under waterfalls of ice and rocks
In the heart of the everlasting winter
I'm nothing more than a single breath
Floating over mists and summits
Hand in hand with the beautiful death

This is where I came from
Moving slowly into empty spaces
In living quality of silence and fierce forces
I'm staying forever

Avalanches of bright insights
Born among eternal pillars of snow
Wide nothingness disrupts me
But thereâs no way back, only moving forward
Black abyss staring at me
As I reach to the ferocious stars
Fearless, invincible to damage
I am roaming through the endless night

This is where I came from
Moving slowly into empty spaces
In living quality of silence and fierce forces
I'm staying forever
