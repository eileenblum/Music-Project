Drown me, pull me under
To the place where I can go
Time heals nothing
I just want to
I just want to be gone

Face the sunrise with wounds in my back
Baptised by invisible enemy
Whatâs not destroying
Making me stronger
As I grow colder and colder
The warrior inside me broken
Pointless battles
Reckless intentions
Only time this pain is quiet
Is when my skin is breaking on metal

Scars all over me
In your eyes I lost the way home
Time heals nothing
I just want to
I just want to be gone

All my atoms back to waves
Eternal flow
Annihilation
The sedative is slowly fading
During temporary seizures of madness
Betrayal after betrayal
Left my spirit bleeding
Devastated from shallow existence
Wanna leave it all behind

Drown me, pull me under
To the place where only I can go
No one will ever find me
In the place where only I can go

Scars all over me
In your eyes I lost the way home
Time heals nothing
I just want to
I just want to be gone
In your eyes I felt like home
I just want to find the truth
I just want to
I just want to be gone
