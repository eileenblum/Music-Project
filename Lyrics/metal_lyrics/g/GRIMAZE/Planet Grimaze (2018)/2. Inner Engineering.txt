It took forever for me to face myself
To walk right up between the walls of my own hell
It took a long time for me to remember death
Shedding this flesh over and over
The same mistakes all over again
Scars, fear, hate, rage
This paranoid mind just playing with the matter
Vile thoughts made of concrete and steel
Time has come to heal

Breaking
All defensive patterns
Stealing pieces of my dreams
Facing
Starving monsters in the mirror
Glass is shattered from their screams

Undertows dragged me in a vicious vortex
Along with ghosts immersed in self-deception
Disappointment from outer circumstances
Chance for glancing through the ignorance veil

It took a long time for me to rebuild myself
Walking the way in layer by layer
Taking off all the armor and shields
Skin, bones, pride, lies
Self-knowledge
A path to inner transformation
In the heart thereâs a sacred field
What you sow you reap

Breaking
All defensive patterns
Stealing pieces of my dreams
Facing
Starving monsters in the mirror
Glass is shattered from their screams

Words mean nothing to me
I am stuck
Still going nowhere
