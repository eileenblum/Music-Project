Born destroyer
My genes carry the message of Pluto
Subtle energy
But when it hits planets collide
Intense Duality
Torn apart on the axis of life
Rainbows glow around me
But floods flow inside

Endless life force
Eyes marked with rings of freedom
A primal drive
For Growth
Below the surface
My dense structures melting to fluid
A primal drive
To Destroy

Atomic Power
My actions carry the message of Pluto
For transformation
And regeneration of inhuman kind
Unprepared
I'm breathing from the Cosmic Wisdom
Scorpius glows above me
But floods flow inside

Endless life force
Eyes marked with rings of freedom
A primal drive
For Growth
Below the surface
My dense structures melting to fluid
A primal drive
To Destroy

Breathing off the stars
A final glance into the past
Facing a crossroad left behind
I can hear my steps
Entering the tree of life
Barefeet and senseless
Blessed with living death
The beautiful illusion
Could no longer quench my hunger

At the dawn of a new beginning
Lie the roots of the fall
In the abyss of a waking mind
Fragmentation is the road to all
