Disobey
The primitive inside
Domination over all native instincts
Disobey the primitive
Liberation from the monster rising
Disobey

Programmed like a soulless robot
Slave of primal animal drives
Addicted to biochemical explosions
A glass of lies while time dies by

The rings of Saturn are breaking around me
Tree of knowledge is dying inside
Through winds of silence the Spirit whispers

Disobey
The primitive inside
Domination over all native instincts
Disobey the primitive
Liberation from the monsters rising
Disobey

Calm, unreachable, endurant
Know the enemy better than I know myself
Unpredictable and disciplined
Though flawless strategy all battles owned

War inside me calling
Initiated by a higher nature
Will of steel is growing
As evolutionary changes taking space
Plugging out of this evident nonsense
Massive trance of sensational obedience
Addicted to biochemical explosions
Killing low desires is the only way out

The rings of Saturn are breaking around me
This tree of knowledge dying inside
The winds of silence whisper

Disobey
The primitive inside
Domination over all native instincts
Disobey the primitive
Liberation from the monsters rising
Disobey
