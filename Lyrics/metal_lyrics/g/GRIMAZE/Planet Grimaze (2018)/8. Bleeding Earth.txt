Ashamed of my own kind
Before the mountain I'm kneeling
To ask forgiveness
For all the wounds
For all the reckless actions
Why canât we see
All the tears gathered in the oceans
And this bleeding Earth
We're leaving
For the future children

All this sacred life
Fading away
Why are we taking
Much more than we give

Close your eyes now
Once more choose blindness
Before the answers
Destroying all
Thatâs real and breathing
Sometimes I dream
Of vicious fire pouring from the stars
And I feel relieved
To see this madness
Coming to an end

All this sacred life
Fading away
Where will we go
When nothing remains

Low we've fallen
But I can only change myself
No way out of this
So I call for waves
To come wash us away
I wanna see it all crumble
Nothing of this world
Can harm me
Cause what is real
Can never be killed
