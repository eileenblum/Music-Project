Rage drilling my lungs
My breaths turn to flames
Black smoke all over my face
Invading me like plague
Those years of fierce anger
Residing under the skin
Now building ruthless armies
Heading north with the autumn wind

Inside me there's a space
I need to stay away from
My heart is growing blades there
I can't feel right from wrong
This mist falling over
Turning me all cold and numb
Darkness crawling in my being
A living fortress Iâve become

Blizzards in my veins
Loud echoes, mental chains
Circling enchanted plains
It is so hard to change
This black hole in my chest
Winter whiteness cannot cover
All light is dying there
Just the north star guides me

Inside me there's a sea
I feel like I am drowning
Maze of ice holds the key
A living fortress Iâm becoming
This black hole in my chest
The winter whiteness cannot cover
All light dying in there
Just the north star in the sky
