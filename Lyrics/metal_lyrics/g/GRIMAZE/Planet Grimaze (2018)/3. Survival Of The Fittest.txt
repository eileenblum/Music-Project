One more word and I will set this room in flames
I am tired of fitting perceptions
I am no longer lying myself
One more move and I'll show you the strength of my stand
Won't let you destroy my potential
While pretending to bring me salvation

Cruel wisdom in a laughing mind
Determination of a fearless will
Preservation of a sacred truth
It's survival of the fittest

Stop the thirst for attention
No respect if not deserved
Stop the acceptance addiction
Be true! Survival of the fittest

No more control over my thoughts and actions
My chances are mine to take
My choices are mine to make
No more lies, no toxic defensive patterns
No shame, no masks, no roles
This dimension will stay in the past

Cruel wisdom in a laughing mind
Determination of a fearless will
Preservation of a sacred truth
It's survival of the fittest

Stop the thirst for attention
No respect if not deserved
Stop the acceptance addiction
Be true! Survival of the fittest
