The field contains an orb celestial eternal forever
Shifting like the tide of the universe
Torn between a polar field
Suspended on an axis a slave to the chron
A planetary dynamo fuels convection in the core
Breeding weakness in the filed shifting energy through tectonics

Beyond the reversal
Slaves to the chron
Beyond the reversal
Anomalous underground
Reversal
A shift in the field
Beyond the reversal
Nature's law repealed

A weakened field folds an open door
Invisible storm form particles raining down
Semi conductivities behave as a low pass filter
Removing variations
Magnetic anomalies
Recorded in the ground
Etched into time
An eternal record

Mapped through polarity
Mapped through polarity

Chaotic poles form scrambling the field
Periodically until
The balance sets in and the field takes shape
Mapped through polarity

The field contains an orb celestial eternal forever
Shifting like the tide of the universe

Bound for eternity
A spectral dance
On a loop
Played out to blind eyes

Beyond the reversal
Slaves to the chron
Beyond the reversal
Anomalous underground
Reversal
A shift in the field
Beyond the reversal
Nature's law repealed
