Buried and confined experimental facility
The largest hadron collider of highest energy
Physicists predicting differing theories
Scientists and engineers
Locked in their laboratories

Fundamental particles had mass
When controlling their interactions
Where previous experiences
Should require them to be mass-less

Synchrotrons â designed to â collide â particle beams â proton â collisions â injection of energy â advancing â understanding â of physical laws â explaining symmetry â developing technologies

Structure of the sub-atomic world
Derived by collisions
Gathers evidence of the laws
Of nature governing it
High energy collisions
By-products are produced
An immediate decay â impossible to study alternate ways
