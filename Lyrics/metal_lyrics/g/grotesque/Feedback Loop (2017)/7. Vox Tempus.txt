The state of the universe
Was transitory
Tending to evolve giving rise to
Manifestations
Of fundamental forces

Through a formation known as symmetry breaking

Manifest materialisation
Coercion, compulsion of impetuous
Primordial matter dispersed in a force of plenary energy

Transformed into light through billions of years
Light stretched into electromagnetic waves
Rendered unobservable by the visible spectrum
Invisible but detectable

Ethereal â discernible â ethereal

Veiled energies decipher footprints
Modified by technology

Light is an oscillation
Not affected by magnetic
Or electric fields
Passing through a linear medium

Electric â generates magnetic
Magnetic generates electric
Passing through linear mediums

A symphony bound by repetition
Causing the formation
Of electromagnetic waves

Traceable by instruments to prove inception

A symphony bound by repetition
Causing the formation
Of electromagnetic waves

Transformed into light through billions of years
Light stretched into electromagnetic waves
Rendered unobservable by the visible spectrum
Invisible but detectable

Ethereal â discernible â ethereal
