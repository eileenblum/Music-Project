[Lyric &amp; music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

The existence of man
Force half-witted to faith
Bound to eat and drink
The flesh and blood of

Christ
Praise his flesh to a closure with
Yahweh
Praise his blood to crawl beside his Throne

Hymns
Chants to refine their conscience
Monuments
Raised to conceal their taking

The illusion of an afterlife
Promised by the bread of Christ
Righteousness is in reach
By asking for forgiveness for their Sins

To a god created by men
Molded through centuries to fulfill the wicked wishes
Of the high ranked men
To kill and impale and to burn all their critics

Worship
Love this egocentric childish God
A reflected tyrant of his creators
Follow and shackle the blinders
Protected from knowledge, singing

Hymns
Chants to refine their conscience
Monuments
Raised to conceal their taking, all by sins
By a god created by men

Molded through centuries to fulfill the wicked wishes
Of the high ranked men
To kill and impale and to burn all their critics from existence

Obey his vicious father
Yahweh
Inhale the lies served by the never-ending flow of men
Searching for lambs to enslave all to be honored and to crawl in gold
