[Lyric and music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

Begotten in faith
Weakened for possession
Marked by basilicas
Kneeling confessing

Sermon
Of sickness
Blessed
By the word of
The serpent

It has been written
True faith will yield
Power to banish demons
And speak their tongue
To stain the children
With crucifix and water

I'm Legion
I'm your proof of
Existence

Sermon
Cursed by their own religion
For the weak
God bless this sickness

Retained and oppressed
In spasm to hide the mind
Tortured of delusion
In vain for the unclean

I'm Satan
I'm the proof of nothing
