[Lyric and music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

Council of Nicaea
I'm faith
Embrace the cause
Man-made to unite

Kneeling in tabernacles, awaiting the second coming
All living and dead will be judged, all to burn in his grace

He will walk in linen, blessing the blind with sight and
Reliance
With unrestrained faith to his fathers
Path

Oppose your God
Deny his proclaiming divinity

Deny the son who crawled out of a virgin bleeding mother
To save his disciples to clean the world from misery

God from God
Light from Light
True God from true God

Council of Nicaea
I'm faith embrace the cause
Man-made to unite

Divided in three, one born to be betrayed and drained from his cross
All to resurrect and proclaim his father's work

Oppose your God
Deny his proclaiming divinity

I'm faith embrace the cause
Man-made to unite
I'm faith embrace the cause
Man-made to enslave
