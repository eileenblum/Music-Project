[Lyric and music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

I'm death
The conquer of lands to fulfill the prophecy
All vowed by ancient forefathers
This is the tide, this is the creation of war

I'm death
The highest offer to God
I'm faith
The highest commitment

By God, hateful wicked
To claim the Promised Land
By God, hateful wicked
Let the blood remain to flow

The plague and the considered father Abraham
Fetter the world on the altar to burn
Guiding his follower to replenish the fire blindly
Blessing the globe to flourish in a holy war

Self-proclaimed ambassadors consume mankind
Tearing down the relics from a former world
Covered by God, capturing men to behead proudly
Prey on women to rape and children to nail

Mislead to a 'cause, poverty claim soldiers
Promoting hate to revenge with terror
Growing mistrust between terrified nations
Sever and condemn the enemy behind the wall

I'm death
The highest offer to God
I'm faith
The highest commitment

By God, hateful wicked
To claim the Promised Land
By God, hateful wicked
The blood will remain to flow for God
