[Lyric and music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

A starving and wounded soul
Longing for nutrition and safeness
All unable to escape
By fear, feeding and licking his flesh

By toll and gifts
Offered by lambs
He laughs
In charity and diamonds, to ravish and revel in wealth
Still allowed to pass the expanding eye of the needle
To heaven

Marked by scriptures, raised to perceive, the tares among the wheat
Orchestrated to ensure income and loyalty
Swallow the scraps of heaven in the illusion of something greater
Spreading the word, without the insight of corruption

Deserters betrayed by bloodline
All to be forced to uphold and serve the myth

A tenth of all to maintain the monster
Sweat to hold up the throne, allowing them to grow
A new age of followers, breastfeed with sour milk
Convinced by perverted camels to make this world their paradise

Feeding and licking his flesh

By toll and gifts
Offered by lambs
He laughs
In charity and diamonds, to ravish and revel in wealth
Still allowed to pass the expanding eye of the needle

A rejection of anthems, shall led darkness, weeping and gnashing teeth
Hell is realized by worms in a never-ending scam
Flourished by servants, eager to hear hand-picked verses
All to justify the 'cause and plead for salvation

A denied freedom ordered by egocentric leaders
Influence the soul to always stay hollow
Consume the world in the name of their believes
All to let them embrace wealth and power before the end
