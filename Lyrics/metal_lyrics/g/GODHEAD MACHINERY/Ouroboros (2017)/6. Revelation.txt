[Lyric and music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

I stood upon the soil of Eden and saw a beast rise up out of men
Having several heads upon his tainted flesh

Some heads were wounded and some were godlike
They praised his flesh and licked his wounds which gave power unto the beast

Great towers were built for obedience and they worshipped the beast
The beast then gave birth to a man who smiled and painted the heaven

The beast grew and tore up the ground with his contaminated talons
All to unlit the sky
