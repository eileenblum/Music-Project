[Lyric &amp; music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

Awaken
The century of men
Rival
To dethrone the myth

Accuse the fatherâs extraction
Change the light into an everlasting darkness
Betrayer, impostor and liars
Who hide behind the shades of this creation

Lit the stars of heaven, one by one
To complete and wield the morning star
Follow its light to guidance
To expose the repulsive filth of worms in the dark

Tremble
For the unfolding surface
Afraid
To fall into a dead oblivion

Alpha reborn to demolish
The sublime kings
Illumine Earth
From blinders and sin
Pave the way
To a paradise without God

Search
For the key of evolution
Unlock
The truth of the hollow gate

Embrace the rain of sulfur, break the oath
To watch it burn the shrines of madness

Arrive
Bringer of light
Awake me

We are
Alpha reborn to demolish
The sublime kings
Illumine Earth
From blinders and sin
Pave the way
To a paradise without God
