[Lyric: Niklas Ekwall, music: Robert Kail Karlsson]

Obedient are the lambs who has seen affliction under the lash of his wrath
And therefore I see clearly

Inferior
Liar
Sinner
Outcast
Enslaved by the teachings of no one to please the winged machine
But silent are the miracles, the graces and the truth

You will submit by his throne
Yield to the spoken words

Behold the wrath that was assigned to him, chosen by few
But silent are the retribution, the swords and the siege

Your prayers shall be shut
Crooked shall your path be

He has driven me and brought me into darkness
He has blocked my ways with blocks of stones
He has besieged and enveloped me with tribulation
And therefore act freely

Silence
Your skin shall burn in a solar storm, and the rivers dry out
But silent are the water, the wind and the sun

Doomed to dwell alone
Therefore I speak freely
