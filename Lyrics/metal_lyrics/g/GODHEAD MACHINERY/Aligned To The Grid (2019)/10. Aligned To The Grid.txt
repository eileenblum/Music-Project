[Lyric: Niklas Ekwall and Robert Kail Karlsson, music: Robert Kail Karlsson]

We bleed, freeze and adapt
Reproduce, lie and kill
We bury and morn our lost ones
Insistent to belong to the grid
With unique personas within the circus
We are aligned

We strive, work and observe
Control, crave and bound
We raise our next be successful
Expanding the pieces in the grid
With a thought of being enlightened
We stay aligned

We imagine our ways to be justified
Branded and guided by survival and hope
Given a pattern of true desires
Aligned to the grid
Genesis of the human submission

We replicate our life to binary giants
Abstracted by a masquerade of relief
Awareness fixated on castles of air
Aligned to the grid
Consume to amuse the artificial design

We close our eyes for the industrial formula
Too weak to endure the brutal reality
Suspending the ethics to enjoy their offer
Aligned to the grid
Believe the unfulfilled values of the shell

Our purpose of life is pre-defined
Patterns build to increase efficiency
Routines that leads to our own demise
Aligned to the grid
All to follow and serve the limited trail
