[Lyric and music: Robert Kail Karlsson]

Devoured by earth, a sacred offer
Cursed by the name carrier vessels
Soak the ground and grasping for life
The essence of revelation

Perceiving the vision
The father of slaves, the fuel for an admired disorder
Behold the angelic humming
Hear the prophecy who shackle the flesh in their name

Reborn
Among the stars on a glowing altar
Thrive in the existential presence
Witness the several headed beast
Withstand his call

Defy, the words that has been written
Digest, the stories that has been told

Perceiving the vision
The father of slaves, the fuel for an admired disorder
Behold the angelic humming
Hear the prophecy who shackle the flesh in their name

Form
The celestial sphere
To dethrone
The obnoxious monarchs

Awake the darkened sun to shine at the frozen existence of men

Erase
The bricks of impure
To wither
The prophets grounding

Revive the soil of the second of coming
Making the past to appear in disgrace

Depart
From the apostles
To cleanse
The crumbling heaven

Arise to crawl among a legion of equals
Craving for life above the grey mass of man
