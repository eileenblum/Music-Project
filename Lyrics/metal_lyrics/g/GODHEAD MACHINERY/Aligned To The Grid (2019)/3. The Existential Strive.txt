[Lyric: Niklas Ekwall, music: Robert Kail Karlsson]

Cast down
The one of true intuition
Chained and condemned
An enforcer of fictional filth
And repulsive seditious influence

Witness God's machinery
Let the land tremble in fear
As the world get counseled
By the clouds of ashes and sulfur

Satan
Wave of the furious sea
Untamed force that dwells within

Follow they who walked the path of Kain
They who rebelled with Korah

Behold God's misery
Let the fallen ascend
As the enlighten defy
Provoking the throne of Rome

Sinners
The ones of true intuition
Discovered and conquered
Enforcer of rebellion
And liberty
Godhead laws denied
