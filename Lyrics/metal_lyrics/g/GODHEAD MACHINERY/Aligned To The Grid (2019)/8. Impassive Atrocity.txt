[Lyric: Niklas Ekwall, music: Robert Kail Karlsson]

As we think and rewind
Remembers and reflect
And the depth in our gaze
Reveals the smile that hides our agony

Shivering spines
Murderers allied
Kill, for mankind
Failed indoctrination craves victims
Manic conviction and so history repeat itself

Forward
Deny

Ignite the flame, sons of oppression
With fierce wrath shall you rejoice and prevail
To make our names echo through eternity

Bright as starlight
Their pale skin contrast to the black soil
As the red dawn rises
Their cries, never to be heard

Those who stand at the edge of time
And felt its cold embrace
As our worlds collide
Fear the rage of the ambitious

I'm the truth
I'm the lie
The hope in their eyes
Still I do not feel

Forward and die

Ignite the flame, sons of oppression
With fierce wrath shall you rejoice and prevail

As I remember the closure of humanity
Their ashes cleansed by the indifferent wind
