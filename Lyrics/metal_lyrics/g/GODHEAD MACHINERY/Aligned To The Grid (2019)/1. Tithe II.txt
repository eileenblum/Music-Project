[Lyric and music are by Robert Kail Karlsson]

The synthesis of master and heard
A disorient singular to be aligned with

God's trail
Words of guilt
Obliged to give
For a permit to his
Egocentric kingdom

Eyes, disabled to see
Ears, disorient by words
Mind, tuned to obey
Smell, the garden of delight

Follow
Tailors of mammon
Drown in wealth
By skinny lambs
Driven to his resurrection

Awaiting his yield
A small price for
Redemption

Behold the stars
For those are at sale within the heard
For those giving a tithe for an eternal life

Followers embrace the offer

Eyes, disabled to see
Ears, disorient by words
Mind, tuned to obey
Smell, the garden of delight
Follow, to nurse God's path
