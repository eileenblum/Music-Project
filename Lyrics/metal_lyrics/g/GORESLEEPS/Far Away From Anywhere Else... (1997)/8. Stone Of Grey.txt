[Music: Jeff, Lyrics: Kelly]

Mental vortex whirled me down
I have lost my sense
Naked helpless, I was drowned
In the tears of sand
Yellow scenery lying around
Yellow everywhere.
Gold dust concealed the town
Town from stone of grey.

Touch the stone of grey
Say you are the same
Feel your life dissones
In those ancient days
Wisdom of that time
Now into your head
Tightly shut your orbs
Hearken stone of grey

Sand has stolen time I slept
Doze enveloped me
Ruins (are) breathing moveless, and
Town starting live
Old emotions passed by
Like a silent none
Everlasting glory ride
For exhavsted mind.

We're speaking by the hints
Words I never knew
Vague shadows goes
Memory of mine through
Bloody paints of war
Anxious peaceful still
Sad tears of the dole
Rivers of the beer
Stone guides me on
Along my glorious way
Hearken psyche of stone
Feel the stone of grey.
