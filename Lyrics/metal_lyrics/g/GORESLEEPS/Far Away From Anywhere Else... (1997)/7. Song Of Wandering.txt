[Music: Jeff, Lyrics: Siggi]

When dome of heaven will be shine with stars
And the Moon will light up the excited waves' dance
The white Prow will saill up from fulgent South
And I'll Hear the song of wanderings in the splash of surf.

I will sink info the deep of night
O'er the bridge woven of sinern light
I will ascend the elvish ship
And it will sail away in my sleep
To Avalon, blading in royal shine
I will be sense splashes of brine
I'll be inhale the fair wind
In boundless foam (in vast of the foam)
Where the stars will be lead.
I know, it's a dream, which one day will come true
I'd like you to sail wherever I do
When the white sheet will come in the sight on the south
You'll know song of wandering from the splash of surt

We will sink into the deep of night
O'er the bridge woven of silvern light
We will ascend the elvish ship
And it will sail away in my, sleep
To Avalon, blazing in royal shine
We will be sense splashes of brine
Well be inhale the fair wind
In boundless foam, where the stars will be lead.
