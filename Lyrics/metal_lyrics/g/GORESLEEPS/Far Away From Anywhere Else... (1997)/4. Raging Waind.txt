[Music: Jeff, Lyrics: Hamri]

With no face, no debts to pay
With no faith, but with no doubts
I'd become the raging waind -
Power cannot be delayed.

Always wandering alone
Searching nothing, loved by none
On the fire from within
With the hardness of the stone

I'll leave my human forms behind
I would become the raging waind.

Always here and always there
Being calm whilst being burnt
Playing with the autumn leaves -
Weight for waind supposed to bear.

Recreate the now-and-here
On the wings forever straight
Flying free beyond the clouds
With no fuss, no wain, no fear.

I'll leave my human forms behind
I would become the raging wiand
Amorphous me forever be
You'll feel me, but you'll never see.
