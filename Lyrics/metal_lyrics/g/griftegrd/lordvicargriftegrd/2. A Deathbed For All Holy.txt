[performed by GriftegÃ¥rd]I'm not happy when you're happy
I'm not sad when you're sad
But I do cry as I laugh
When fortunes lips
That you seek to kiss
Prove to be the devil's ass

Circles within circles they stand
Vulturous prophets, masters of man
Shining ones, building Leviathan
Weaving illusion, Ad nauseam

And when you tell
Of your friends
That all do so well
It's just a listing
Of horrid demons
The dignitaries of hell!

Circles within circles they stand
Vulturous prophets, masters of man
Shining ones, building Leviathan
Weaving illusion, Ad nauseam

Soaked in triviality
Fools frown at me
Corruptible serfs in trance
All cold, all void inside
Like zombies reeking
From overdue suicides

Circles within circles they stand
Vulturous prophets, masters of man
Shining ones, building Leviathan
Weaving illusion, Ad nauseam

Sedated by the porn
Of a snuff reality
Tucked in, in complacency
The world is a deathbed for all holy
In which Satan sweetly dreams
In which Satan sweetly dreams
