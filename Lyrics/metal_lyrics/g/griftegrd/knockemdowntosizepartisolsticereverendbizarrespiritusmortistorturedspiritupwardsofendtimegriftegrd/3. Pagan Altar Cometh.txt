[performed by GriftegÃ¥rd]Men and angels never met except in the stone
Of temples left discarded and overgrown
From the void a pagan altar cometh
Megalithic messenger of ancient gods
Pulverizing all faith in the son of man
Proving all Christian doctrines false
Where once stood pillars now only trunks of trees
Guard the splinters of statues lulled by the breeze
