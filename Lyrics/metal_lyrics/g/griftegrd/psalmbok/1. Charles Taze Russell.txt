Pass on the unleavened bread, don't drink the bitter wine
You are not among the chosen, but soon you'll receive what's coming

Christ comes through the window, Christ comes through the roof
Christ comes to kill sin, Christ comes in truth

Heavenly Father angry with his children, sends his firstborn to kill them
High and low they will all fall by the swords of Heavens Horde

Holy ground covered by dead religious, on the doors of the Sanctimonious
No mark of lamb's blood painted, Earth is cleansed, no longer tainted

Christ stands triumphant, hateful master
The lion's will is done, disaster
Man cannot suffer enough for his sins
Man cannot suffer enough for the nails.
