[performed by GriftegÃ¥rd]I've been touched by the hands of God
Say something, say something
Through your cold hands I slipped
Down where all is dimly lit
In this abyss I'll always be
Cursed am I, forlorn by thee

Sunrise again
Rays shower a man
Cold to the sensation
He don't care for the light
Or the day's revelations
Down here's no peace
His detachment from anger
Was a wedding to grief

I've been touched by the hands of God
Say something, say something
Through his numb hands I slipped
Down where demons keep all dimly lit
In this abyss I'll always be
Cursed am I, forlorn by thee

Sundown again
Shadows follow a man
In resignation
No wave of anger breaks
The confines of medication
Still he can't be here now
So he runs from running
Into grief
