Sailing along unaware,
Bumping and crashing through time and space,
Like flies trapped in a bottle,
Unable to seem
Although our walls are clear
Endless space abounds,
But then lungs contract
The air of our time runs out,
We drop down,
Over and over...
The lack of ceiling, spins
A vortex,
Pulling up yet pushing down
As though even cosmic omnipotence is...
Conflicted.

The explicable try to control
What has become lightning in a bottle...
Energy passes through glass,
Extending towards eternity,
Though its power never ends,
It merely changes
Akin to sand into glass...
Many grains blend to create the new form...
And these new shards are the stars
The stars that will fall and shatter the stained glass of our imaginations...
