Saline saturation,
Hapless suspension,
Total sensory deprivation,
Involuntary exanguination...

Skin swelling,
Mind bending...

Tracheal tubes penetrate,
Consistent,
Subtle strangulation...

Eyes are sealed,
The mind is free,
Soaring through space and time,
Visiting worlds not yet seen...

Complete separation
Of tangible reality,
Complete Replacement,
Of psyche and soul...

Creating new realities,
In service of detached mentalities,
Inter-planetary intellect,
Supported by transcendence through pain.
