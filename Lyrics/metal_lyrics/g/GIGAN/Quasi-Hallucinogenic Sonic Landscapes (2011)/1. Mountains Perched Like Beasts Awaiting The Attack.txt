Gargantuan stone golems,
Poised and ready,
With an unearthly shriek,
They lumber forth,
Massive and encrusted with time.
For millennia they observed...
Absorbing and processing fantastic amounts of latent energy of all types.
Their broken landscapes a forgotten fixture
A flawless unintentional trap.
Between the super and the natural
Between those two is a gap.
A gap sometimes overflowing with infinite amounts of molecular energy.
Created by positive and negative thought...
'Twas this energy that pulsed and surged
Careening towards the "humble" teeth of the land.
Thus opening the gaping maw of death.
Once animated-
The shambling and plodding colossi
Unleash a brand of archaic carnage unmatched in its
Efficiency and savagery!
The once proud planes are now a desolate quarry...
No more flesh,
No more soul,
Just stark judgment
Made of stone.
The barren landscape proudly displays its strength-
A strength nurtured by the never ending scars of ignorance
Left behind by the throngs of organisms too encircled by their own lives
To focus on the positive energy need to spurn their own demise.
