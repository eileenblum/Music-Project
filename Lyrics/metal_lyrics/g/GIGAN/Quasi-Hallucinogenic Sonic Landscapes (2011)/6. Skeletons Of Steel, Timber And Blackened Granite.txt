Obliteration...
Blue-white lightning,
Surging through in a blinding flash...

Smooth as glass,
Fierce as fire,
Unbent like marble,
Unbroken like steel.

Spider ships and shark fighters
From a rogue galaxy,
The armies of doom,
Robo-terydactyl attack,
Orchestrated but chaotic laser blitz,
Resulting in total submission.

Frail human command,
Eroded by miscommunications and greed,
Enables infiltration and destruction...

Earthly armaments,
A fool's paradise...
Prepare for insurrection!

Vibrant cones of blinding light,
Blistering winds and toxic plumes,
Twisted iron and melted steel,
Burning wood and poison fumes...

Unrelenting barrage,
Insectozoid carnage,
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL COMIC ATTACK!!!

Scattered and fleeing in all directions,
Frozen in time,
The faces of war.
Total desperation,
The unilateral fate is clear,
Rubble and wreckage,
Cages of stone,
Obliterated landscape,
Paths strewn with bones,
Futile existence,
Aimless trail of death ahead,
Once bright futures now replaces with impending dread...
