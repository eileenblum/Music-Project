Spitting light,
Shooting through flesh and bone,
Inversion of gravity,
Twirling on an unknown axis,
All things known now unknown,
Surrounded by sun, fire, heat,
But no smoke or flame...

Intense illumination,
Blinding points of light,
Each one a piece of your being,
Thrown to the winds...

Scattered broken lightning,
Replaces the once solid form,
Structure and substance washed away...
You are reborn.

Blistering upwards trajectory,
Velocity bordering on teleportation,
Near instantaneous relocation,
Followed by uninterrupted blazing luminescence.
