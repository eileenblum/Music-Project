Startled within sleep,
Body tingling,
Beads of sweat like raindrops rushing down a window,
Tormented,
Ceaselessly the drums pound...
Pulsing,
Rhythmic patterns not of this world...
Every idle moment,
Whispers,
Suggestions,
Influences,
Their origins unbeknownst...
Unbeknownst to all,
Interference,
Unseen energies overpowering my psyche,
Guiding my creativity,
Painfully pushing into my mind...

Standing in the center,
Thoughts like a body of water,
Its presence breaks her surface
Undulating ripples push through my currents,
...And the undertow pulls me away...
Away from what is mine,
Away from what was pure,
Towards its ultimate design.
