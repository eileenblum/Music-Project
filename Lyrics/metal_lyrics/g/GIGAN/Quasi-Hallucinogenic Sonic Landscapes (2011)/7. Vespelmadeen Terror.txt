A race older than time,
Thousands of generations
Raised on torment.
Entire lives locked in training,
One purpose,
One goal,
Steamrolling societies,
Eradicating ecologies.

Nullify the nature,
Negate the nurture,
Utter replacement of the structure and order!

Fleets upon fleets,
Speed towards their destination,
Quadrant leaders ready,
Battalions in check,
Weaponry in order,
Time to unleash genocidal torture!

The battles engage,
Violence blood and rage,
Corpse piles climbed to partake in war,

It all continues until few are left:
The bleeding stock
Then the true terror begins...
