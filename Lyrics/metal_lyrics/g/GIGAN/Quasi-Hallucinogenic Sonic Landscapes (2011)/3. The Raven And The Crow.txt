As wings cut through sky and air,
Currents are pushed and cleared away
So too are the lives of the loved,
Sometimes a necessary action.
Navigation was once pre-ordained,
Now the flights are independent,
Like natural thought patterns
Distinct and defined...
Sometimes to be understood,
One must push away,
Isolation is the catalyst,
Mental and chemical reactions
CEREBELLUM EVOLUTION!!!
Obsidian plumage,
Flat black, as pitch
A mirror of image of itself,
A reversal of the soul state,
Talons once brittle now bronze!

So tear, Raven.
Rip and tear away,
Tear away the lies and fear
And split the sky with your song
And leave the flock of crows behind...
