Rambling oily legions of doom
Stinking inhuman atrocities
Isolated
Segregated
Uninstigated
Roiling dervish of blood and pain

Indiscriminate in their scope
Bound by blood and death
Ravages upon ravages
Violence until that final breath

Objects of worship
Throughout infinite worlds and time
A perpetual masquerade
And a sorcerer's foolish pride
Combined with immortal guile
And summon forth the gibbering hordes...

Reversal without exception
Intentions inverted
New-found perversions and degradation
All unto the immaculate Zemiath

IA Zemiath!
Zemiath IA!
