Equilateral separation
A sum equal to its parts
Mathematical communication
Numbers re-routed
To better serve the infinite arts...

The riddle of Sierpinski
Laid out for all to see
Only those with open minds
Will benefit and live free...

Those that choose to walk about blind
Deaf, dumb and in fear
After all is made equal
Their purpose will be made clear...
Our existence is but a passing fancy
Never to be repeated
The human race has had its chance
We deserve to be defeated

Turn back around
Stumble back into the mire
And prepare to be bathed
In everlasting fire
