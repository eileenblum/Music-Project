She lives there
Down that path
She is the mother toads
Blood
For the devils
That's what I've been told

Bulbous
Wide and warted
Flowing undulations under her clothes
Her minions
Low and lazy
Ensorcelled and frenzied upon command

Eternal hunt for new seed
Entrapment and misdeeds
Walking down that path it leads...
To her infinite horror

Pinned down upon the ground
Never to make another sound
All around you the death toads surround
As you impregnate the mother of toads
