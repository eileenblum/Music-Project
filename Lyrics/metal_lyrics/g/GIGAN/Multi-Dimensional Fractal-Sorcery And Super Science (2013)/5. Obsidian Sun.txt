It's swirling center
Of blackened ore
Infinite absolute zero
This frozen orb...
Pulling planets on solar winds
Icy graves to live within...

Denizens of the frigid deep
When cold stars die
And black suns sleep
To your frozen land we creep
To bask under the obsidian sun

Hear our chants
Smell our scents
Feel our hearts
Taste our blood
And bring us to bask
Under the obsidian sun
