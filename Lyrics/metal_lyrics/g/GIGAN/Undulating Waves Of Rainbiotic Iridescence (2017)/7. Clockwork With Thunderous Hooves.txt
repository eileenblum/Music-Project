Few things are certain
Those that are, confound
The more we learn the less we know
Yesterday's certainty is tomorrow's hope
And the past's regrets are the future's intent

Seasons pass and time gallops forward
Merciless
Unrelenting
Insatiable
Trampling lives and leaving misery in it's wake

Innocent and without intent
Chaos
Carnage
Incidental fate
All things irrelevant behind it's face

Sun glints off time's unblemished armor
Shining
Flawless
Brilliant
With it's sheen and star-phosphorescence
It's resilience matched only by it's persistence

Infinite trajectory
Barreling forward
Fire-breathing nostrils flaring
Generations naught but ash in it's wake
Blood-hued mane blazing black
As the hooves like clockwork
Gallop on...
