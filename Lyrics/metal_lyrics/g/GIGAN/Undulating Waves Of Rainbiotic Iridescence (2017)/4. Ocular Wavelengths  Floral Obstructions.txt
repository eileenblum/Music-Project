Reality altered
Another plane of existence unlocked
Sights unseen
Fears unknown
Caught in the warp
The warp of mind and sight

As layers pour down
Colors and spectrums envelop
A vibrant woven visual blanket
Pulled over your eyes
Tunnel vision
Pinhole focus
Watering eyes and bleeding mind
Pulsating waves
Flowing undulations
Colors ebb and weep

Submerged periphery
Gazing through the clouds
Spun/sugar iridescence
Pulling apart a spider's web
Peering through the brilliant haze
Until you return from the 'looking glass'

Once the blood runs thin
Shards of metal do their part
And slowly light shines from within
