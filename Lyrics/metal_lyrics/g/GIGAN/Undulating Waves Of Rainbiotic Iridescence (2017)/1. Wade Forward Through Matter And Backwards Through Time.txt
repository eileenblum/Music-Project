Scenes shift
Images bleed through
Forces push and pull
Illusions of consistency
Fluidity
Normalcy
All illusions - Eternally

Persistence with elegance
Without fear
Without want
Without trappings of those who haunt

Unrelentingly - tides flow
Unforgivingly - matter slows
But water flows around matter
And air passes at will through time
So might we be
Throughout our lives?

Despite the irrelevance
In spite of the pain
The cycle continues
Again and again and again...

Rise above and strain to reach
The air is thin but thoughts are clear
Just take comfort and have no fear...
And always wade forward through matter
And backwards through time
