Vibrancy
Bursting
Glimmering
Flowing on the surface
Centrifugal pull
Physical telepathy
Spinning
Tumbling into the void
Feel the weight of the miasma
Saturating itself
Sealed within the waves of twilight

Another burst
Vibrance
Crystalline branches of broken spectrum
Grains of salt across a pane of glass
Spider web fractures
Like upon a frozen pond
Suspended in time
Lava flowing black
Flowing
Rolling
Burning clean to start anew
