Science and sorcery
Invoked again
Intense mathematics
Alchemic design
Rigid template of preparations
Woven with spontaneous creativity

Intuition and inner peace
At times all best intents are rebuked
Unfortunate grave reality consumes
Reality once just twisted
Now is bent
A crease in reality
All allowances spent
Once the role awareness snaps
You'll drift away...

Past realities contract
Replaced by the swell of now...
Arrival opposite the gateway ensues
Blinding rays and flickering hues...
Sometimes
Time must take time
To be the time
To stop time
