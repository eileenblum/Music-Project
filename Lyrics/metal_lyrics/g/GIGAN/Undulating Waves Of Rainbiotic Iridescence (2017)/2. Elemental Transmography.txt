Within transmogrifying matrix
One must incorporate blood
Metals
Salts and spirits
Even your own ghost
The mortal seed
Familiars and liaisons
Pathways walked backwards
Face forward
Mumbling lips
Quivering fingertips
Sweltering oils
Tendrils of smoke crawl and twist

Fear not the end
The end isn't real
Neither your shell
Once under control
Just listen well

Once seen and opened
And the bridge has been crossed
Never look back
'Lest all hope be lost
Every form
Every music
Is only there as long as it's wanted
In this you can trust
