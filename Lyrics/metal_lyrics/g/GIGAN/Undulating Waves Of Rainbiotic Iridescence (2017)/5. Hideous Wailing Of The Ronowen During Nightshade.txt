It would be the last thing you ever heard...
Wailing
Hideous wailing
The type that awakens nightmares from sleep
Behind you
All around you
Making your blood sweat with fear...

As the sky's palette goes from blue to gray
As the pink and purples bleed away
Nightshade gives way to darkness
And darkness is the ronowen

Flapping
Fluttering
Slithering and more...
You push back madness as chaos ensues

Daemonic echo location
Pulling of your metallic salts
Losing control...

The wailing approaches
Like a deafening flock of birds
It's dark now and your fate is sealed...
Each body this night will be divided in thirds
Such is the way of the ronowen
