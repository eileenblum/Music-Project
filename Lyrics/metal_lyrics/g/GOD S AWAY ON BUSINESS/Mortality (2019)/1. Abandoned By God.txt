One false concept!
One bad try, to liberate us, has destroyed our world!

We march to work, in endless lines like small insects!
We all ignore our world is set to die!
We all were told that our work is for ourselves and for the welfare of the world, what a vicious lie!
We die alone, weak and broken, burned out and destroyed and so much unspoken!
We feel the lashes of the rich on our back!
And when we die they will suck out the wreck!

No god will help us out!
The world will burn no doubt!
Admit it, itâs simple and true:
Your money wouldnât save you!

The rain is toxic.
The woods are dead.
Fished empty oceans.
And we go ahead!
Sea level is rising.
Whole countries dry out.
Ten thousands of species that we have wiped out!
