Deep inhale.
Hold for a time.
Let it out.
Feel it rise!

Woke up the other day
My brain still wrapped in the ghosts of green smoke.
Reality, to depressing for me to stay.
And I won't stay here for long!
It's pointless to stay sober in a world where nothing ever really matters at all
I can hear the green leaf asking for me.
And I'm not gonna miss that call!

With all your power you try to ignore:
This plant isn't grown out of the devils floor!

Fuck the prohibition!
Can't prevent!
Humans just want to get high.
I will smoke until the end of time

Build up a green pyre!
Let me see, hear, feel again.
Let me explore my mind
Let me dream of a better mankind!
