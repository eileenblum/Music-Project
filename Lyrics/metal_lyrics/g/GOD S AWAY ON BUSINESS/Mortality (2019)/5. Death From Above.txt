We live in security
Don't have to fear anyone!
Except those who pretend to protect us all!
Bridge
You're starting, a conflagration you can't keep controlled!
You force us to fight!
Ignore it, but the fire won't stop!

Total surveillance of everyone, overflowing jails!
They do what they want to, and democracy fails!
Ten thousands of people are raising their voice.
But they just don't listen, cause they made their choice!

We live in security
Don't have to fear anyone!
Except those who pretend to protect us all!
We live in a civil war.
When the people begin to fight, I can not guarantee that you will survive!
