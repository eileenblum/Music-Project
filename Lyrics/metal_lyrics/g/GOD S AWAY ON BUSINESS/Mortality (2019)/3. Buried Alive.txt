Wake up!
Realize!
Tied to a bed.
It's decided,
I'm sick.
All my thoughts are wrong, they said! (...I am wrong!)

My dose reality is hanging on a drip.
I'm dazed, day by day.
This all feels like a bad trip! (...the worst trip!)

Stay here!
Don't leave me now
I need you!
I am all
I have, my mind is alone, on my side.
My freedom is gone,
I wish
I could die.
I lost my sense of time...
I'm more than imprisoned.
I feel like
I'm buried alive!

I try to find
My fault
I can not see.
They're driving me crazy
With their attempts to heal me! (...try to kill me?)
