We're weak!
But can't accept that we are.
We accomplished nothing, can't stop our rotting!
We'll always fail to survive!
It leads to insanity, awareness of mortality!

Hoarding of gold, your name written bold, in history won't be the master key!
You can't survive life cause time is a knife that burns in the heart of your destiny!

It rages unconquered planted deep inside of meit rages unconquered awareness of mortality!
Breakdown
I saw them fall,
I saw them cry!
I saw no benefit in knowledge that we will die!
Death knows no tolerance,
King or throll whether you are poor or rich, death gets us all!

We fear, what happens now and tomorrow.
It won't stop our aging, but we're drowning in sorrows!
