[Lyrics: Munster - Music: Niemann]

In the darkness
of this cold night
Trapped in my misery
I suffer in loneliness
Waiting for my end

I close my eyes
Invoke your name
I wanna get closer
And share my pain with you
My dear old man
Life shuts the door to me

[Chorus]
My light has died
The dark past takes me
Far, so far
IÂ´m doomed
To be your mirror
And perpetuate your filthy acts
I learned everything about you
Damned you father!
You were a great teacher

IÂ´m so lost, confused and empty
Drowned in the sea of fear and anger

[Chorus]
I had no way out
Your misery was my guide
My lament your inheritance
My sins your legacy
Blood and hatred unite us
Now waiting for my final judgment
I beg to God or the Devil
Fora fair punishment

At any place
I am going to find you
And we will settle old scores
