[Lyrics: Munster, Niemann - Music: Niemann, Emparan]

Small shadow of light,
I must to speak to you
Our last days have come,
We must leave
Can you hear the silence?...
From this side,
ItÂ´s deafening
Feel my veins,
Feel my breathâ¦
Poor devil,
Where have we come?

Keep away from me
Move away to another corner
Entity of grays
Object of my obsession
Your misery is mine

[Chorus]
Our words are wind
Turn on the light
My dearest mirror
Get out of me!
Source of my destiny
My loneliness entails
You are my doom
The cross of my conviction

Little damn shadow,
Where have you gone?
Come, listen to me once more
The doors are open,
We must leave now
Do you remember
When everything began?
Infinite twilight,
intense orange
Eternal time
destroying my soul

Keep away from me
Move away to another corner
Entity of grays
Object of my obsession
Your misery is mine

[Chorus) ]
Our words are wind
Turn on the light
My dearest mirror
We must leave now!
Look at me dear
Piece of me
Where have we come?
ItÂ´s time to say goodbye

Sin mÃ­ no te irÃ¡s,
sombra querida,
arrÃ¡strame hacia ti
Sin mÃ­ no sobrevivirÃ¡s
hija de mi propia oscuridad
Nuestra hora ha llegado

YouÂ´ll not go without me
My dearest shadow,
Drag me to you
YouÂ´ll not survive without me
Daughter of my own darkness
Our time has come
