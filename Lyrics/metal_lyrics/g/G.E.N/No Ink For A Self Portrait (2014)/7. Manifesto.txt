[Lyrics: Munster - Music: Niemann]

I donÂ´t remember
The last time I was
Free, constant
And with dreams to live
ThereÂ´s no sense
I canÂ´t find the inspiration
That incites me
And demands me
To try to forget the pain

I want to escape
To the final door
I canât any more
I need peace

Today my strengths
Fall rendered
Against distress
That destroys my desires to be free
There is nothing that encourages me
There is no will
My fate, of manifesto is here

I did everything
To bring my faith back again
Eternal days
Searching for a signal
It was useless
Never a chance
That would bring me hope,
No reasons to live for

I want to escape
To the final door
I canât any more
I need peace

Today my strengths
Fall rendered
Against distress
That destroys my desires to be free
There is nothing that encourages me
There is no will
My fate, of manifesto is here

I did everything
To bring my faith back again
Eternal days
