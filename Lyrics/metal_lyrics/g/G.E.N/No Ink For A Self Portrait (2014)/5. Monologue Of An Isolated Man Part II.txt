[Lyrics: Munster, Niemann - Music: Niemann]

Where has everyone gone?
I cannot see them
WhereÂ´s my family,
My friends,
The smiles?

I look everywhere
And I canât find
This lost piece...
I canÂ´t find
My memories key
To scrutinize in the conscience
Of those who were with me.

Where are those who were
Looking for a change?

I want to know
Where their bodies are,
Their memories,
Their desperate sighs?

I want to get
My child eyes again
Get back to my motherâs belly
And then find the lost comfort

And here,
Where return doesnÂ´t exist,
And forgiveness itÂ´s only an illusion
Say goodbye to my friendsâ hands,
To the shadows,
To the daylight

IÂ´ve thrown my prose
To the emptiness
I admit it
I donÂ´t have forces anymore

Where are our dead men?
Are they still alive within us?
Where are all of them?
Can someone hear me?
Do not go away
I am not prepared to be alone
