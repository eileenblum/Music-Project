[Lyrics: Munster - Music: Niemann, Emparan]

You came out of nowhere
Pleading for mercy
Your angelical face
Invades my memory

While I hear your voice
Dark memories disturbs my peace
Itâs your dark aura
And despite your weeping
I can feel your empty words
Your sick mind

[Chorus]
IÂ´m sorry pretty girl
YouÂ´re lost in time
I donÂ´t need you anymore
I donÂ´t want any rottenness in my life
Your presence displeases me

Please stop lying
I know your shameful truth

Your fucking dead tears
DonÂ´t affect me, they are not real
I donÂ´t believe you
Manipulative woman
You are dead for me

[Chorus]
IÂ´m sorry pretty girl
YouÂ´re buried in hell
Forgotten beauty ghost
I donât want your evil in my heart
I hate your perfidious eyes

Damned girl!
Eternal nightmare!

Demon with an angelical face
You want to kill me again
Killer snake
IÂ´ll not fall down in your trap
