[Lyrics: Munster - Music: Niemann]

Listen to me
Feel my voice through your dreams
IÂ´ve come for you today

I need to speak to you
For the last time
To tell you
DonÂ´t cry for my any more
I want you to forget me
And live again
Stop suffering

DonÂ´t look back
My soul has gone away
Only memories remain
DonÂ´t hold on to me
It makes no sense
Please end your pain

You must turn the page
Accept my depart and find your way
Your destiny
YouÂ´ll never be alone
IÂ´ll always be with you
Guardian of beyond
By your side Iâll walk
Trusting youÂ´ll achieve
And your promises youÂ´ll fulfill

For you
For me
ThereÂ´re no more words to be said
No one to blame
Nothing that disturbs my rest

Please let me goâ¦ let me die
Please let me goâ¦ let me die

You must turn the page
Accept my depart and find your way
Your destiny
YouÂ´ll never be alone
IÂ´ll always be with you
Guardian of beyond
By your side Iâll walk
Trusting youÂ´ll achieve
And your promises youÂ´ll fulfill

For you
For me
ThereÂ´re no more words to be said
No one to blame
Nothing that disturbs my rest

I need to speak to you
DonÂ´t cry for my any more
Stop suffering

My love Farewell
My love farewell
