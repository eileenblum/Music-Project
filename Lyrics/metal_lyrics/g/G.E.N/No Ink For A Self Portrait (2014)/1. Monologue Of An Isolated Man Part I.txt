[Lyrics: Munster, Niemann - Music: Niemann]

Dear son, I need to talk to you
Come hereâ¦ Hold meâ¦
There will never be distance between us
Can you recognize my voice?

[Chorus]
You donÂ´t remember it anymore, of course not,
Canât you remember you couldnât be without me?
How strongly you used to wake me up every morning?
because you, wonderful piece of me, needed me

Maybe you didnât love me again this strong
I wasnât essential for you anymore
All these years carrying this cross
The pain of waking up every day and not see your smile

[Chorus]
Life was ungrateful,
and I had to move away from my main creationâ¦
And still after so much time
I am still feeling caught in a perpetual emptiness,
impossible to be filledâ¦ to be filled

My loneliness is implacable
I would give everything to go back

My son, every note of this song is a tear from your father,
Please allow this melody to reach beyond your heart
And feel me close again
Even for a last time
