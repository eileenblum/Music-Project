I'm moving on, I hear the sound tonight
So powerful and mighty
I'm standing here in the frontline now
I have no fear, you're with me

[Bridge:]
The drums of war is in the air
The day of doom
Are you prepared?
Don't fall asleep
When the thieves comes in the night
Seal your heart and receive the light
Receive the light

[Chorus:]
The final day
When the King returns
I hear the angels sing
Praise to the King of Kings
Oh what a day when the King returns
Jesus Christ - the King of Kings

They say I am a fool
Believe in a fairy tale
There is no Saviour coming
Mankind is blind, see all the signs tonight
Don't you see the end is coming now

[Bridge:]
The drums of war is in the air
The day of doom
Are you prepared?
Don't fall asleep
When the thieves comes in the night
Seal your heart and receive the light
Receive the light

[Chorus:]
The final day
When the King returns
I hear the angels sing
Praise to the King of Kings
Oh what a day when the King returns
Jesus Christ - the King of Kings

[Guitar &amp; keyboard solo]

[Bridge:]
The drums of war is in the air
The day of doom
Are you prepared?
Don't fall asleep
When the thieves comes in the night
Seal your heart and receive the light
Receive the light

[Chorus:]
The final day
When the King returns
I hear the angels sing
Praise to the King of Kings
Oh what a day when the King returns
Jesus Christ - the King of Kings
