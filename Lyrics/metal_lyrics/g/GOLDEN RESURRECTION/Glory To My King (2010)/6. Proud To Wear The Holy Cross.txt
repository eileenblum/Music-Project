This is a story, most important of them all
About the Son of Man
When He walked on earth, He taught us how to live
His Holy Kingdom will reign

[Bridge:]
I was young
Jesus came into my life
Holy Spirit lives in me
You made my life complete

[Chorus:]
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross

Still the fire, burning on my heart
You are the captain of my soul
When I read the Bible, (Divine) wisdom comes to me
You're the saviour, my King

[Bridge:]
I was young
Jesus came into my life
Holy Spirit lives in me
You made my life complete

[Chorus:]
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross

[Guitar solo]

I am a messenger, messenger for the King
I'm proud to live, I wear the Holy Cross
His Holy Kingdom is totally free from sip
Jesus is the answer, the answer for everything

[Keyboard solo &amp; guitar lead]

[Chorus:]
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross
I wear the Holy Cross
You shed your blood for us
You rose from the dead
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross

Holy is your name
Jesus - You're my everything
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross
Hallowed be Thy Name
I'm waiting for the day
I'm proud to wear the Holy Cross
