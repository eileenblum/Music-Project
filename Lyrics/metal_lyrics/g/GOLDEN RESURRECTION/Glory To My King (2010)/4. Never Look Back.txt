Never look back...

I've been caught by broken dreams many times
Occupations of my mind
Dark chapters of my history will drag me down
Time to leave the past behind
Once for all

[Bridge:]
Break these chains
Release my burdens
I face a new day
I close the door
Let me live again!

[Chorus:]
I'll never look back
Live my life for my maker today
There's no time to lose
Life has so much to give
I'll never look back

Reaching out for things
With no value in the end
Only occupations of my mind
Time for God, time for family
And for my friends
This is what matters in the end

[Bridge:]
Break these chains
Release my burdens
I face a new day
I close the door
Let me live again!

[Chorus:]
I'll never look back
Live my life for my maker today
There's no time to lose
Life has so much to give
I'll never look back again

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus:]
I'll never look back
Live my life for my maker today
There's no time to lose
Life has so much to give
I'll never look back
I'll never look back
Live my life for my maker today
There's no time to lose
Life has so much to give
I'll never look back
Never look back...
