My passion for music, started long a time ago
A wonderful world, a love affair
I will share with everyone

[Bridge:]
I drink from the water
From the well that never ends
My spirit sing out loud

[Chorus:]
This is my life, this is my call
I have checked in to God's Grand Hotel
Where the music lives forever
This is my life, this is my call
Now is the time to taste it and see
I welcome you all
To God's Grand Hotel

Day after day, the music is there
A God given gift for all us here on earth to share

[Bridge:]
I drink from the water
From the well that never ends
My spirit sing out loud

[Chorus:]
This is my life, this is my call
I have checked in to God's Grand Hotel
Where the music lives forever
This is my life, this is my call
Now is the time to taste it and see
I welcome you all
To God's Grand Hotel

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus:]
This is my life, this is my call
I have checked in to God's Grand Hotel
Where the music lives forever
This is my life, this is my call
Now is the time to taste it and see
I welcome you all
To God's Grand Hotel

God's Grand Hotel...
