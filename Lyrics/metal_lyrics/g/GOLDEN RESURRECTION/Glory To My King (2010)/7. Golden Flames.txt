Golden flames
We are the golden flames
Golden flames
We are the golden flames

Time, time's running fast, no time to relax
We're lost in broken systems
Today we are blind to see the reality

We have, we have to break through
Before it's too late
The walls are growing higher
We don't realize
We are losing the game

[Bridge:]
Here we come
To show the world there is a way
Beyond this crazy game
We cannot win

[Chorus:]
Golden flames
We are the golden flames
Every nation shall see
Golden flames
We will never surrender, no, no

We all, we all have to choose
The way we will go, it's no easy living
Time's running fast, there's no time to lose

[Bridge 1:]
Here we come
To show the world there is a way
Beyond this crazy game
We cannot win

[Bridge 2:]
Our hearts are burning bright and clear
Don't give up today, there's time for you and me

[Chorus:]
Golden flames
We are the golden flames
Every nation shall see
Golden flames
We will never surrender, no, no

[Guitar &amp; keyboard solos]

We're golden flames
Here we come
We're golden flames
Here we come, here we come, here we come

[Bridge 1:]
Here we come
To show the world there is a way
Beyond this crazy game
We cannot win

[Chorus:]
Golden flames
We are the golden flames
Every nation shall see
Golden flames
We will never surrender, no, no
Golden flames
We are the golden flames
Every nation shall see
Golden flames
We will never surrender, no, no
Golden flames
We will never surrender
Golden flames
Golden flames
