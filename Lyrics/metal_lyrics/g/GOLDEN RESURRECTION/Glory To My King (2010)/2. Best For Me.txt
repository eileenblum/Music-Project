You are always by my side...
You are always by my side...

Lots of action in the pipeline
Yeah I need to sort it out
Make a change to see the balance
Yeah I know it's hard to work it out

[Bridge:]
Live and learn
Get down to basics
I lay my life into your hands

[Chorus:]
You are always by my side
Until the end of time
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me
You are always by my side
Until the end of time
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me

Searching for a fast solution
Don't fool yourself
Be wise, go an extra mile
Give time for your own reflections
Build strong and slow, you'll get it all

[Bridge:]
Live and learn
Get down to basics
I lay my life into your hands

[Chorus:]
You are always by my side
Until the end of time
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me
You are always by my side
Until the end of time
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge:]
Live and learn
Get down to basics
I lay my life into your hands

[Chorus:]
You are always by my side
Until the end of time
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me
You are always by my side
Until the end of time
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me
You are...
You are always by my side
Always want the best for me
You!!!
I'm not afraid
You always want the best for me
You...
