Glory to my King!!!

Welcome to my house
Don't be afraid my friend
I know it's safe here
And you are invited

The world's getting colder
You're looking for love that lasts
You're in the right place and you are invited

[Bridge:]
He's been there
All along your way
Just open up your heart
He's breathing life into your soul
He is the Living God
The rock that never falls

[Chorus:]
I'm standing here
Sing glory to my King
He is my everything
No turning back
Darkness will fade away
Glory to my King
Glory to my King

The Holy Spirit will guide you and me today
We are the sons and daughters of eternity

[Bridge:]
He's been there
All along your way
Just open up your heart
He's breathing life into your soul
He is the Living God
The rock that never falls

[Chorus:]
I'm standing here
Sing glory to my King
He is my everything
No turning back
Darkness will fade away
Glory to my King

[Guitar &amp; keyboard solo]

[Chorus:]
I'm standing here
Sing glory to my King
He is my everything
No turning back
Darkness will fade away
Glory to my King
I'm standing here
Sing glory to my King
He is my everything
No turning back
Darkness will fade away
Glory to my King
Glory to my King
Glory... my King...
