Here I stand
I look out to the world
So many mountains I have climbed
Will it end
Yeah, will it ever end
Will I ever reach the final goal

[Bridge:]
Hear me God
Help me now
Give me strength to carry on

[Chorus:]
See my commands
Follow them all
You're my creation
I care for you all
Seek in your heart
You'll find the way
See my commands

When I was young
Everything was black and white
I'm all confused
I'm running blind

[Bridge:]
Hear me God
Help me now
Give me strength to carry on

[Chorus:]
See my commands
Follow them all
You're my creation
I care for you all
Seek in your heart
You'll find the way
See my commands

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2x:]
See my commands
Follow them all
You're my creation
I care for you all
Seek in your heart
You'll find the way
See my commands
