[Christian:] How far, how far will we go?
We are so proud, one single mind!
[Tommy:] Soon our hearts will be dead
There's nothing left and we turn stonecold
[Christian:] We have to melt the ice
Invite the spirit into your inner zone
[Tommy:] You'll find the fruits, the treasure
You're not alone

[Chorus:]
[Christian:] We're hunting high
We're hunting low
Trapped in this cage
Tell me God when will it end?
[Tommy:] Hear me now
Hear my prayers
Tell me when I'm finally free
Finally free

[Christian:] The killer instincts, our egos has gone too far
Where is the heart? Tell me man where is your heart?
[Tommy:] Time to facing the fire and deceiving the liar
Jesus is the only way out!

[Chorus:]
[Christian:] We're hunting high
We're hunting low
Trapped in this cage
Tell me God when will it end?
[Tommy:] Hear me now
Hear my prayers
Tell me when I'm finally free
Finally free

[Solo: Kenneth &amp; Tommy]

[Chorus:]
[Christian:] We're hunting high
We're hunting low
Trapped in this cage
Tell me God when will it end?
[Christian:] We're hunting high
We're hunting low
Trapped in this cage
Tell me God when will it end?
[Tommy:] Hear me now
Hear my prayers
Tell me when I'm finally free
Finally free
Finally free!!!
Finally free!
