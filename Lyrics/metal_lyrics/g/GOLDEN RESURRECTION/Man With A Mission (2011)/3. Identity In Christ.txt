Back in the days
When I was young
I was so naive
True love is hard to find
All need to be seen

You and I we're all the same
Under the skin
We are the chosen one
Out of history

Looking for of your love
Give me for the truth I last forever

I'm moving on (I'm moving on)
I'moving on by the spirit
You give me love, I find my identity (Find my identity)
I'm moving on (I'm moving on)
I'm moving on by the spirit
You give me hope, I find my identity in Christ

What is perfect?, What is true?
The edges are so hard to find
We are blinded by the media sensation
