[Guitar lead: Tommy]

We're on the road
Travelling far
See new faces, see new places
This is our mission
This is our passion
Are you ready
It's time for some action

We are the servants
We are the soldiers
God is our captain
We'll bring you the music

[Bridge:]
We care for you
We love to play
so raise up your hands
J.C - the Only way

[Chorus:]
We're gonna rock this place, Comon'
Are you ready fot the power
We're gonna rock this place, Comon'
We will take you higher

In God we trust
We are believers
On (the) stage we're proud
We sing about Jesus!
Holy fire is burning Higher
We'll never stop
Never getting tired

[Bridge:]
We care for you
We love to play
so raise up your hands
J.C - the Only way

[Chorus:]
We're gonna rock this place, Comon'
Are you ready fot the power
We're gonna rock this place, Comon'
We will take you higher

[Solo: Tommy &amp; Kenneth]
