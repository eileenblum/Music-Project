See my children
They're playing their games
So full of life, so innocent
Created by the master's hand
I know this time is running so fast
Let me capture this day and make it last forever

[Bridge:]
Listen, you're the future we have
The new generation of the brave

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on
You're the children of tomorrow
Hold on and never giving up, my child
Hold on, hold on
You're the children of tomorrow
Hold on and never giving up, my child

(My) little children, I know there will come a day
When I can't protect you
But the angels are there
Spreading their wings of love (around)

[Bridge:]
You're the future we have
(The new) generation of the brave

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on
You're the children of tomorrow
Hold on and never giving up, my child
Hold on, hold on
You're the children of tomorrow
Hold on and never giving up, my child

Read the Bible
You'll find the truth
God will always care for you
Eternal love you will find and you get
Inner peace of mind

[Solo: Tommy &amp; Kenneth]

[Bridge:]
You're the future we have
(The new) generation of the brave

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on
You're the children of tomorrow
Hold on and never giving up, my child
Hold on, hold on
You're the children of tomorrow
Hold on and never giving up, my child

Hold on, generation of the... brave!!!
