Attention now all boys and girls
Take the chance to be the one
You were planned to be
It's a mystery, God knows the best for you and me

[Bridge:]
You are unique with lots of gifts
Perfectly made, (there's) only one of you

[Chorus:]
Reach for the sky, don't lose your heart
Reach for the sky, you are the flaming youth
Reach for the sky, God's in control
Reach for the sky, the flaming youth you are

[Break lead: Tommy]

Another day, another chance
Your life it's only up to you
He's always there, He always cares
Jesus on the line for us all

[Bridge:]
You are unique with lots of gifts
Perfectly made, (there's) only one of you

[Chorus:]
Reach for the sky, don't lose your heart
Reach for the sky, you are the flaming youth
Reach for the sky, God's in control
Reach for the sky, the flaming youth you are

[Solo: Tommy &amp; Kenneth]

You are the music, you are the fire
You are the hope, reaching higher

[Chorus:]
Reach for the sky, don't lose your heart
Reach for the sky, you are the flaming youth
Reach for the sky, God's in control
Reach for the sky, the flaming youth you are

Aaahh! Flaming youth!

Oh!
