Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!

Standing in the frontline for over twenty years
Still the mission is growing strong in me
(Still the mission is growing strong in me)
So many places I've seen around the world
Still the fire burning in my heart

[Bridge 1:]
When I hear the music in the air
(When I hear the music in the air)
The burning flame in me
Explodes and I will sing

[Chorus:]
[Christian:] I love it loud, I love it clear
[Tommy:] I love the music, want to sing
Show the world the living hope
Standing on the rock!
[Christian:] I love it loud, I love it clear
[Tommy:] I love the music, want to sing
Show the world the living hope
[Christian:] Standing on the rock!

Brothers and sisters
Together we are strong
Come along join me in this song
Let the spirit guide you
Let it rise like a healing flame
Leave troubled waters far behind

[Bridge 2:]
When you hear the music in the air
(When you hear the music in the air)
The burning flame on you
Explodes and you will sing

[Chorus:]
[Christian:] I love it loud, I love it clear
[Tommy:] I love the music, want to sing
Show the world the living hope
Standing on the rock!
[Christian:] I love it loud, I love it clear
[Tommy:] I love the music, want to sing
Show the world the living hope
Standing on the rock!

I love it loud, I love it clear
I love it loud, I love it clear
I love it loud, I love it clear
Standing on the rock!!!

[Solo: Tommy &amp; Kenneth]

Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!

[Chorus:]
[Christian:] I love it loud, I love it clear
[Tommy:] I love the music, want to sing
Show the world the living hope
Standing on the rock!
[Christian:] I love it loud, I love it clear
[Tommy:] I love the music, want to sing
Show the world the living hope
Standing on the rock!!!!
