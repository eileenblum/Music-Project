[Christian:] I'm a man with a mission
God is the reason
I'm sharing this news for you

I'm a man with a mission
I've made my decision
My heart is marked by the cross

I'm a man with a mission
Running through fire
Until I reach my goal

I'm a man with a mission
Jesus is the answer
The door is open for the world

Sometimes I have to walk alone
To fully understand God's way

I'm a man with a Mission
Focus my vision
Using my voice for the call

I'm a man with a mission
And God is my captain
I'm sailing through the storms

[Tommy:] Don't worry, just rest in my arms
I am your God, I have total control
Leave your worries behind

Ahhhhh!!!!

[Christian:] I'm a man with a mission
Bringing news 'bout salvation
For the lost, rich and the poor

I'm a man with a mission
Working for the kingdom
With Jesus you enter the door

Working for the kingdom
With Jesus you enter the door

[Solo: Kenneth &amp; Tommy]

[Christian:] I see the young, I see them all
Give them your time, before they will fall
We all want the truth, no false propaganda
Action not words, give them your time

[Tommy:] See the lady, see the man
No time to lose, Jesus coming
[Christian:] Ending calling, the King is coming soon

I'm a man with a mission
Using my voice for the call
I'm a man with a mission
My heart is marked by the cross

I'm a man with a mission
I'm sharing good news to the world
I'm a man with a mission
Jesus - King of Kings!
