There is only tomorrow
Nothing but sorrow waiting for you.
Don't look for any mystery
It's only history we're passing through.
The threat from the east
Growing stronger with each passing hour.
All systems are failing
And talks with the west have turned sour.

The leaders are waiting for blood on their hands.
Playing with weapons they don't understand.
Could it be this time we'll see the end of the world.

Each day brings a new danger
Love is a stranger we used to know.
Outside, the sun goes on rising.
But we're realizing there's not long to go.
The storm clouds are forming
Take held of the warning to come.
The Kremlin has told every nation
There's no place to run.

The leaders are waiting for blood on their hands.
Playing with weapons they don't understand.
Could it be this time we'll see the end of the world.

The end of the world.
The end of the world.
The end of the world.

The threat from the east
Growing stronger with each passing hour.
All systems are failing
And talks with the west have turned sour.

The leaders are waiting for blood on their hands.
Playing with weapons they don't understand.
Could it be this time we'll see the end of the world.

The end of the world.
The end of the world.

The end of the world.
The end of the world.

The end of the world.
The end of the world.
