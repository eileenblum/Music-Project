I still remember when you came into my life
I fell in love (I fell in love)
And I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
Music with action given from above to me yeah!

[Chorus:]
I remember the golden days
I remember the golden times
When you took me by surprise
I hear the music so alive
I remember the golden days
I remember the golden times
And the show must go on
That is my life where I belong

Everyday the music never fade away
Like the sun
You warm up my life
Everyday the music never fade away
Like the sun
You warm up my life

I still remember when I heard the final countdown
I fell in love (I fell in love)
and I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
Music with action and satisfaction garantied (satisfaction garantied)
Yeah yeah yeah!

[Chorus:]
I remember the golden days
I remember the golden times
When you took me by surprise
I hear the music so alive
I remember the golden days
I remember the golden times
And the show must go on
That is my life where I belong

You are the music, You are the sun

[Solo: Tommy]

[Chorus x2:]
I remember the golden days
I remember the golden times
When you took me by surprise
I hear the music so alive
I remember the golden days
I remember the golden times
And the show must go on
That is my life where I belong
