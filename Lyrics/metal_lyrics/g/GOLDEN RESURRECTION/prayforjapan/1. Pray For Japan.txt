[Christian:]
In a time
When your heart is broken
Confusion is all you feel
[Tommy:]
There's hope around the corner
Hold on, together we are strong

[Chorus:]
Give hope for a new tomorrow
Give hope to all the families
Show love and care for the children
We pray for Japan

[Christian:]
We are all here together
We're sharing your suffering
[Tommy:]
There's hope, around the corner
Hold on, together we are strong

[Chorus:]
Give hope for a new tomorrow
Give hope to all the families
Show love and care for the children
We pray for Japan

[Guitar solo]

[Tommy:]
Join our hands
Sons and daughters of Japan
We're united, we're one for you

[Chorus:]
Give hope for a new tomorrow
Give hope to all the families
Show love and care for the children
We pray for Japan
