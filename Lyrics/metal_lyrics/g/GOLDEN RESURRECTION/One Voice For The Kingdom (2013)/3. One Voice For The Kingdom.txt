I can hear the sound,
There's something in the air.
Connection from another world,
The spirit in my heart
Been waiting for this day,
Heaven's symphony for all to hear.

All hearts together as one,
There's music and there's Love,
In perfect harmony.

No more suffering,
And sorrow in the World
The angels praise His holy name.
The spirit in my heart
Been waiting for this day,
Heaven's symphony for all to hear.

One voice for the Kingdom.
One voice all glory to the King.
One voice for every nation.
One voice there is no stronger love.
One voice for the broken souls.
