Golden warriors!

The Holy Bible,
The Word will tell,
Prophecies been spoken.
The King of kings will return,
The world is not listening.
Warning sirens fills the air,
We put the armours on,
We're prepared for the day.

We raise our swords
We're the Golden Warriors
Love is our weapon
We're the keepers of the burning flame

Golden Resurrection
We are waiting for the day
Golden Resurrection
The Son of glory
Will end the perfect glory

We've seen the wars
We've seen the nations fall,
All disguised by the devil's lies,
Now the time right,
When the world will see light
The King will return,
Everybody, look the sky!
