So many days and so many nights I cried
I see the madness all around the world

Don't ever lose your heart
Still time for a brand new start
The sun will shine
With the golden light

See the signs
Up in the sky
The Lord will reign
We praise your holy name
No more lies
Evil in disguise
Hallowed be thy name
Your temple will remain
Your temple will remain

I'm singing out loud, crying out my soul
I see the dark one taking control

Don't ever lose your heart
Still time for a brand new start
The sun will shine
With the golden light

See the signs
Up in the sky
The Lord will reign
We praise your holy name
No more lies
Evil in disguise
Hallowed be thy name
Your temple will remain
Your temple will remain

Herren Ã¤r min herde,
Mig skall inte fattas
Han fÃ¶r till vatten
DÃ¤r jag finner ro fÃ¶r min sjÃ¤l

Don't ever lose your heart
Still time for a brand new start
The sun will shine
With the golden light

See the signs
Up in the sky
The Lord will reign
We praise your holy name
No more lies
Evil in disguise
Hallowed be thy name
Your temple will remain
Your temple will remain
