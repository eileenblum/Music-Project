I see the differences
I hear when people joking
They don't know
They are bricks in the game

Before I lost my temper
Now I use my wisdom
Holy Spirit show me how to live

I will fight, I will never die
I will fight and follow the call of my life

Live or die
Stand or fall
Beware your heart
It is a spirit war

Live or die
Stand or fall
Beware your heart, my friend
It is a spirit war

It's hard when friendships failing
The enemy is waiting
To stamp my heart into the ground
The wings of freedom calls me
No surrender
Reaching high to heaven's victory

I will fight, I will never die
I will fight and follow the call of my life

Live or die
Stand or fall
Beware your heart
It is a spirit war

Live or die
Stand or fall
Beware your heart, my friend
It is a spirit war

I am here
Fighting the battle
Long live the King

Live or die
Stand or fall
Beware your heart
It is a spirit war

Live or die
Stand or fall
Beware your heart, my friend
It is a spirit war
