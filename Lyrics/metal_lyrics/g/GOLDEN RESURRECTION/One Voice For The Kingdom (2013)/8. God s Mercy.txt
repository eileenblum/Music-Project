God's Mercy,
God's Mercy,
God's Mercy,
for you and for me.

Side by side,
Hand in hand,
We all unit,
We take a stand,
See the heart of mankind,
please don't grow cold.

We raise the banner,
You cannot stop us.
The power of the cross,
will lead us.
When we go blind,
He's always there to take the fall.

You think we're crazy,
Believe in this heavenly thing,
But I know that I wa born,
To share the freedom for the world.
Only Christ can set us free,
God's Mercy,
for you and for me.

No matter what you say,
No matter what you call me.
My life is built on solid ground,
Take a look at yourself,
You are sad and you are lonely,
Only God can move your bitterness away.
