Feel the power rise again,
I feel the fire
My passion never ends,
I am ready!
Are you ready?
Rock and roll for everybody,
My inner passion never ends.

I was born to rock the world,
Show the treasure land for everyone
I was born to rock the world,
Every moment I sing I feel so alive

I carry on, can't slow down,
I will show the world,
The treasure I found,
I carry on, can't slow down,
Cause we're running out of time.

Over thirty years ago,
The action hit me.
It's time to rock and roll,
I am ready!
Are you ready?
Rock and roll for everybody,
My inner passion never ends.
