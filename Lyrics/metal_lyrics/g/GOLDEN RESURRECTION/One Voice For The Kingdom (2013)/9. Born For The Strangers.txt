I am working, I am eating,
I am sleeping and the list goes on,
I have my ups and downs in my life.

I am loving, I am running,
I am falling but I'll rise again
The spirit in me will always survive.

Here I am, I got the world,
I was called, I was born for the strangers

I am writing, I am singing,
I am praying to my Holy God,
He is the reason I exist, He's my rock

I am laughing, I am crying,
I am fighting and don't give up.
The spirit in me will always survive.

I thank you all,
To listening to my songs.
God is here,
All glory to Him my Lord.
