I walk in the darkness
In the dark side of my life
In a world full of sadness
There is no light for my eyes
I walk like a stone on the edge of life
Iâm searching the hope that Iâve seen in your smile

CARRY ON! CARRY ON! LITTLE ONE!
THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND THE SUN!
CARRY ON! CARRY ON! FIND YOUR HOME!
BY THE RIVERS IN YOUR RUN!
YOU WILL SEE IN YOUR DREAMS
A LITTLE LIGHT RISING WITH YOUR THRILLS
IN THE LAND OF THE DREAMS

Me, Iâll return one day
In the land of destiny
And Iâll see you, maybe
In a dream so crazy
But I must walk again
For a long, long time
In a world full of pain
Full of crazy lies...

CARRY ON! CARRY ON! LITTLE ONE!
THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND THE SUN!
CARRY ON! CARRY ON! FIND YOUR HOME!
BY THE RIVERS IN YOUR RUN!
YOU WILL SEE IN YOUR DREAMS
A LITTLE LIGHT RISING WITH YOUR THRILLS
IN THE LAND OF THE DREAMS

But now it's too late
For us to change our fate
You are gone, I'm alone
In a world made of stone!
