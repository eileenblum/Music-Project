I am waiting in a lonely place
I am waiting for you, just to see your face.
In the deep night,
all the high stars are shining for me,
and I see...
One day your way will be,
For me a road to be.
I will wait for you all days of my life!
And I can fell your smile

I am flowing,
like the rivers flow in the endless sea,
just to be free...
All my time,
I dream under the sky!
Iâm dreaming to you, just to see you!
One day your way will be
For me a road to be
I will wait for you all days of my life
I can fell your smile

IâM WAITING FOR YOU
IâM WAITING FOR LOVE
IâM CALLING TO YOU SOULMATE OF LOVE

The rain is falling
The rain is falling down
Falls down on me,
and I see...
I am waiting in a lonely place
I am waiting for you,
just to see your face...
