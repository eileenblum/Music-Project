Iâm gazing around!
A black hole is riping the sky.
A terror crawling!
A silent scream in our minds!
The fire of death is breaking the world through my eyes!!
Come from the stars, the crawling chaos arise.

Come on!!!
This is death and destruction!!

Nowhere to run!
Nowhere to hide in this madness!
The demons arise,
come from the void full of sadness!
Dark damnation!
The end of all things is now!
We can see a light fall into the night!
Through the ground!

CHAOS! KILLER!

All is lost, everything will fall in the madness of destruction
The last day has come, and crawl on the ground.

You can't break my soul !!!!
