From the sky
You have come
In another ray of the sun

Fire is raging through the land
A burning rain spread by your hands
The gods of light rise in the end
Black hole, thunder, rage of light
Arrival saviors, astral fight
But too late for us to surviveâ¦

Silver gods you send a million lights
On the earth and in the skies

You will see my final dream
When this land will fall in tears
When the gods of light will come
Fly away, youâll not apart
Friends you will stay in my heart
When the gods of light will come

Madness's calling all our minds
A never-ending despair now
Freedomâs voices on the ground
The gods take us beyond the void
Another place for us all
But in the end we rise to fallâ¦

Silver gods you send a million lights
On the earth and in the skies

You will see my final dream
When this land will fall in tears
When the gods of light will come
Fly away, youâll not apart
Friends you will stay in my heart
When the gods of light will come.
