Far in a distant place
Somewhere in the universe
In the silent space
There's a way for my soul
Salvation for all! And wisdom for all lifeforms!

We fight an unholy light!
We are born in the kingdom of madness and night!
We're fighting for freedom, unity and wisdom
For the light and all lifeforms!
We march through the silent space!
We search for the old book of light for all races!
Last hope for freedom, unity and wisdom!
Through the stars we are one!!
Hear the universe call!

The light is bright in the book of stars
Read the words and the wisdom will rise
For your soul, for your mind a new way of life!
Truth and might!
Carry on carry on, see the silver light!
Read the words and your wisdom will rise!
For your world, for their minds, open the book of stars!!
Truth and might!!

Somewhere in the black abyss,
There's a land called Galderia!
The one for all our dreams!
It's the land of salvation!
She unite all the Creation with the true revelation!
Here lies, in the arms of light,
The old Book of Stars, the one for all our lives!
It's the keeper of the Universality!
Philosophy of unity!
The one for you and me!

Far in a distant place,
There's a land called Galderia!
Somewhere in the universe!
Here the old Book of Stars spread out its holy light!
Through the aeons of times, for all our lives!!!
