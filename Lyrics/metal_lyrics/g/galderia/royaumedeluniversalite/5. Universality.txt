Iâve searched for a long time for answers and wisdom all around!
I âve found and followed the clues inside my mind!
I look around me, a strange world, a false reality!
I feel a deadly mighty eye that look at me !!

Mankind is going mad! Iâm leaving the ground!
Alone! Far behind!
I know thereâs a place, out in the space,
Where wisdom is might!!

Out in the sky,
Where the dreams learn to fly,
There is a true revelation of life!!
Open the gates,
And a million will see!!!
The Universality will shine for you and for me!

When all minds of universe will see the clues inside their entity,
Theyâll find the means to understand their destiny!!
A legion of dreamers, full of anger, will rise above the air!!
A million voices will unite everywhere!!

And wisdom will guide creation in light, salvation in minds!!
And all of the races of all the space will unite to find the keys of all
mysteries!!!
