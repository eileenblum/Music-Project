We're searching for answers, we search for the light!
We'll never surrender, we're born in the fight!
None shall remember who was good or bad!
But we'll all stand together 'till the end of our time!
All we are strangers in a dark evil world!
Still searching for answers, for the true mighty words!
Dreamers and loners, all those who heard the call,
Unite! All together! For the light! One for all!

Beware! Be strong!
We all stand as one!
We fight for light not for gold!

I FOLLOW THE FIRE FROM THE SKY!
A NEVER-ENDING THRILL, HERE IN MY MIND!
ONE MILLION DREAMS FROM DEEP INSIDE!
AFTER THE RAIN THE SUN WILL SHINE!
AFTER THE STORM THE RAINBOW WILL RISE!
NOTHING IS LOST IF YOU CAN FIND
ANOTHER DREAM IN YOUR MIND!

Always remember the fire inside!
that will guide you forever if you follow your mind!
Look at the future! See all the madness!
To understand this world you must free you heart from the blindness!

Wake up! It's time!
Dreamer, dream now!!
Spread out your holy light!
