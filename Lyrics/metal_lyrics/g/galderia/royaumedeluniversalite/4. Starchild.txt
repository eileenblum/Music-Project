Hide in a distant place, somewhere beyond,
A silent force guides his steps out of the void!
In a cavern of light lies the old book of stone!
Here! The savior of all minds reads the signs on the wall!

He'll rise to guide us out of the dark!!
Bringers of change for all the races lost in the night!!
He rides through the universe to break the signs of the evil curse!
Symbol of freedom, I ask myself!!!
WHERE ARE YOU NOW??

SAVE US NOW!!
We wait for your call!
TAKE US NOW!
Away from the fall!
All the Universe is shining on, but us we are all alone!!
STARCHILD

One day will rise in our everlasting skies
an imortal savior made of the true mighty light!
Born in the stars where the wisdom is might!!
Gardian of the spirit of life againts the blind!

His eyes are shining! A million lights!
A cosmic rage for all the evil fucking lies!
Our world is devastated! Madness rises everywhere!
Every mind falls, so here I call: WHERE ARE YOU NOW!!!
