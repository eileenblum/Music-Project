Masters of illusion you're leading all the blind!
Creators of confusion, by madness and by lies!
The whole world domination under your evil eye!
Tyrants from the outer-space, you're tyranny must die!
Hell is rising through the air, a million in despair!
Madness's calling everywhere, justice is blind! Beware!!!
The leaders in their temples bring the evil for this world!
Hide in their corruption, there's no truth in their words!

Ho! Don't try to put me inside your mascarade!
My heart is heavy but my eyes not blind!
I can see all your game! False is our reality!
A nightmare without end!
Reptiles from the outer-space, your tyranie must end!!

HELL IS CRAWLING AROUND!
HELL IS CALLING YOUR MIND AND YOU CALL FROM HELL
SALVATION AND AND LIGHT! BUT YOUR DAMNED!
HELL, A RIP IN YOUR HEART!
HELL, A NEW WORLD ARISES!
WILL YOU FOLLOW THEIR LIES AND THEIR MASQUERADE?
ALL WE'RE DAMNED!

But the day is near where all the peoples, all shall understand!!
Can you hear? The truth is calling! Screaming through the land!
A million voices unite together! Millions everywhere!
To show the world another light! The true light in the air!
And the tyrants will be uncovered! Their creepy evil plan!
Everyone will realise!! All slaves will break their chains!
And the masters of illusion will be banished in their dimension!!
And all the light will shine forever! Higher than the sun...!

But while waiting we are here in HELL...
