Killing me!!! Iâm lost again!
In the island of pain where no one understand
In the void, Iâve seen the deadly reign
I am back from the dark to fight the master plan

In the night
We are free and we are right
I feel my mind again
In another time
In the night
Let me rise into the light
I will return one day !

We are on the road
To Nowhere from the void
Another day will fall in the deadly hole
I feel my mind again Rising through this land
Can you feel the call deep inside your soul
OUT OF CONTROL !

Freedom voice is lying on the ground
Oh see the world falling down
We run out of this time
Mysteries, weâre searching for the truth
Beyond the deadly hole, we run out of control
