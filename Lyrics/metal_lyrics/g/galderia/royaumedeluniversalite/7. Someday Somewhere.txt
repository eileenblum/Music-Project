I dive into the silent space,
Hope inside my head.
I've seen the futures of the race!!
Where no one understand.
I found my own way to escape
From this evil burning land!!
Be quiet!!! I won't return again!
I run to save my brain!!

I'm riding on and on through the night...

ARE WE ALONE FOREVER THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THIS LIFE??
ALL CHILDREN OF THE EVERLASTING LIGHT WILL HEAR THIS CRY!!
I'M RIDING ON THE WINDS OF WISDOM!
I BELIEVE IN UNITY OF ALL MINDS IN THIS GREAT MYSTERY!!
ARE WE ALONE FOREVER THROUGH THIS LIFE??

I left a world devastated by a global mind control!
Where every man, every day, followed a hypnotising call!
The masters of this game were the reptiles of the shame!
I know no one will understand
So I run to save my brain!!!
