[Seb:]
When the world is fading in the haze of the night
No turning back
All alone we are dreaming of a moment in time
A regret in mind
'Cause something is missing in the haze of the night
No turning back
All alone we are crying for a moment in time
Searching for the light

When despair is calling from the depth of the night
Demons in mind
When they're screaming and laughing
They bring us down, face on the ground
Then it's time for us to hear the Spirit inside, calling so loud
From our pain and our fear we are rising again,
with power in our hands

And the sun is calling out through the endless rain
You can hear in your heart it's calling you once again

[Tom:]
We are living forevermore

[Seb:]
When oblivion is falling from the void of the past,
where nothing remains
When there's no one to trust
We can feel the Spirit from deep inside again

And the sun is breaking through the endless rain
You can hear in your heart it's calling you once again

[Solo: Tom]
