[Tom:]
Flashing through the air, the power's calling everywhere
Through the atmosphere, the sun is calling out, it shines on
We're still alive on the run
Can you feel the truth? A fire's burning in your soul
Through the galaxies, the light is calling us, we ride on
So still alive on the run

[Seb &amp; Tom:]
Flashing through the air
Power's calling everywhere
Through the stormy night
Fury and thunder
Through the end of times
Riding like fire
To feel the breeze of life on the run

[Tom:]
A revelation's dawning on earth
Deep in the heart of mankind
Forever rise from the ashes of lies
To find the secret behind
Now we are one in the heat of the night
(Ho We are living on)
One in the heat of the night
(Yes we are living on)
Living on!!
Blue aura's shining on, and on

[Tom:]
Riding in the light, we fly across the open skies
Through the atmosphere, the power's leading us, we shine on
In the heart of the sun
Can you feel the force, shooting from the universe
Dawning on the earth, to teach us how to live
Ride on!!
You're still alive on the run

[Seb &amp; Tom:]
Riding through the air
Power's calling everywhere
To the end of all
Riding through the fire
Something is alive
Inside, always surrounding us
Just feel the breeze of life on the run

[Solo: Tom]
