[Seb:]
Higher, in the land beyond the sun
Where a new day just began
We're shining on again

Higher, in the land beyond the skies
Where the Spirit's still alive
We shine and learn to fly

Higher, where there's no fear at all
Where the love from our soul
is shining on our way

Higher, where darkness turns to light
Where the angels in flight
are calling out your name

To the land beyond the sun
That we are calling on the run
To the everlasting light
Where the love in our souls is still alive

Where the sun's shining high
Like the stars in the sky
You can feel it's a call from inside
And the light will arise
From the ashes of the lies
We'll return to our glorious life
We'll return to our glorious life

Higher, where the sky shines in blue
A dream will come true
For me and for you

Believe in the land beyond the sun
'Cause a new day just began
We're calling out your name

[Solo: Bruno]
