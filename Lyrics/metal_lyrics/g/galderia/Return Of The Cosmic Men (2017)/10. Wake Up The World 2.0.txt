[Seb:]
We are alive and free from the dark
We are free and here we now rise
Freedom's calling all our minds
Time has come to raise up the light
In unity, the spirit inside
The universe is shining so bright

I will enter the realm of light
I have found my way to survive
Through this madness, the only way out
Here we live in an eternal fight
Pride and glory, the truth from our hearts
Follow me and you'll find your way out

[Tom:]
I've got a dream and freedom will rise
I've found the truth, the power inside
Beauty of life will show us the light
Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho
Power is calling from all around
Dreamers arising here from the ground
Wake up the world and wake up the blind
Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho-Ho

[Tom:]
Galaxies move on, just hear their call
Feel the feeling within us all
Stars are burning, we'll return back home
The Dream of Love comes from our souls
Spread the truth, free from their laws
Raise the light and wake up the world

[Seb:]
I will enter the realm of light
I have found my way to survive
Through this madness, the only way out
Here we live in an eternal fight
Pride and glory, the truth from our hearts
Follow me and you'll find your way out

[Solo: Bob]
