[Seb:]
We are alive so full of life
We are free and here we now rise
Freedom's calling inside our hearts
Time has come open your mind
Let your past and your worries behind
Join us now in this moment divine

[Bob:]
I will enter the realm of light
I have found my way to survive
Through this madness, the only way out

[Tom:]
I've got a dream and freedom will rise
I've found the truth, the power inside
Beauty of life will show us the light
Power is calling from all around
Dreamers arising here from the ground
Wake up the world and wake up the blind

[Seb:]
Galaxies move on, just hear their call
Feel the feeling within us all
Earth is breathing, here is our home
The Dream of Love comes from our souls
Spread the word, out of control
Free your heart, wake up the world

[Bob:]
I will enter the realm of light
I have found my way to survive
Through this madness, the only way out

[Solo: Bruno]
