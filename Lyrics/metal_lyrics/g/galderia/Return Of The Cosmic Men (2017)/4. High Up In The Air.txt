[Seb:]
From the stars,
a revelation from a world divine
is calling out for you and I
ho can't you see the signs?
From the dust we're rising like
a shining dream on earth
Forever searching for the light
Born to break the curse

High up in the air
We never go down, no never again
No never go down again
Far up in the air
We are riding the sun
We will never return deep
in the dark side again
No never again

Leave behind all the memories
that bring you down
Find your own way through the clouds
Forever rising high
Break the curse, you are the children
of the light on earth
You are the ones to make it right
The ones to make it now

[Solo: Seb]
