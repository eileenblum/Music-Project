[Seb:]
Earth is arising
The time has arrived to free
the Spirit locked inside our heart
Mankind, the resurrection day is in sight
Faith is your guide through the madness of life
Endless illusions are roaming around
Hold on to power to find your way out
Free your soul the choice is yours to make

From the horizon we came here on earth
To bring the wisdom for mankind's rebirth
New high vibrations to break the curse
Raising the power inside of us all
We came together from a land far beyond
Cosmic creators, we've all heard the call
Free your soul, the choice is yours to make

[Bob:]
Out of the darkness we rise
Out of the darkside of life
Back from the sun
Our way just begun
We unite
The legions of Light now return

[Seb:]
We are the legions from the sky
Born here on earth to bring back the light
Your time has come to reach for the stars
Open your soul and let it shine, let it shine,
we are one!

[Solo: Bob]
