[Seb:]
So when the time has come, another day
The light is calling on our way
We turn our faces to the sun
Starlights are shining on the run

[Tom:]
When the call inside is calling out
Millions open up their minds
To see the truth behind the lies
To face the dark side in the eyes
No more blind

[Seb &amp; Tom &amp; Bob:]
And we know the time is near
The victory on all fears
The light within our souls to rise again
Far beyond a million years
Born from the dust of times
Mankind is still alive and then we rise

[Seb:]
Up to the sun
Where love shines bright
The soul of human kind
Diamond in the open skies
Still we are free
So proud to be
Alive in harmony
We've found our way to live in a shining unity

[Seb:]
After all these years of illusions
After all these years of pain
We are rising from the grave
A revelation in our hands

From the dust of times we see the signs
So now we open up our minds
To see the truth behind the lies
To face the dark side in the eyes
No more blind

[Solo: Seb &amp; Tom]
