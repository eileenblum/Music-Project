I raise my head into the silence and the air
I hear the voice from deep inside
All my rules come from my own mind
l see a light beyond the void
Ho! Future, save us from the fall!!
Masters of pain will rise again
But in the end you'll see my friend

Another world will rise for all
Beyond the everlasting void
Another place for destiny
Another way for you and me
Can you believe in what you see?
Can you believe that we can free
this world from the masters of pain?

Another day. Another dawn
Another dream rise from the ground
You'll see the clues. You'll see the truth
Another way for me and you
And from far away we see the day
where all our dreams will go away
Don't cry my friend! Don't loose your brain
'Cause all this world has gone insane!!
It's a circle of illusion!!

I see an empire of damnation all around
Spread the fear, spread the pain
and bring the lies for all mankind
My friend it's time to break the circle of illusion
A masquerade plays around us
Beware or die!! We all live in a garden of lies!!

I see an empire of damnation all around
Spread the fear, spread the pain
and bring the lies for all mankind
My friend it's time to break the circle of illusion
A masquerade plays around us
Beware or die!! We all live in a garden of lies!!
