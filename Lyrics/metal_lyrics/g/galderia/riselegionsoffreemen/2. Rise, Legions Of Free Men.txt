Lost in a world of illusion
Where madness is flashing around
Trapped in a mighty confusion
Where the liars are divine
Hide behind their false game
The leaders of the majestic hell
Bring all the pain and delusion
For the great masquerade
So it's time!!!!!!

To rise from the battle
To stand all as one
Our voices united, for the truth and the dream in our hearts
One dream of bravery
A cosmic unity
Our universal glory
And the liars will gaze at the skies
To repent their unholy lies
Legions, rise!!!!!

High on the path of destiny
We've heard the call from our soul
Power, truth and unity
Love is the key!
Stand tall with the faith inside your heart
'Cause here we are one with the stars
All the Creation is calling for the awakening
Now it's time!!!

We rise as one, from the ashes of the grave
Eternal soul, show us our final aim
In a world of lies, we are shining here, once again
Masters of pain, your show is over!
We all rise above your chains
Now free in minds, we can see all your masquerade
The spirit is rising! The awakening!
The truth emerge front the ground!!!

We are the warriors!!
We are the warriors of light!!
We are the warriors of the eternal stars!!
And the glory will rise!!

To rise from the battle
To stand all as one
Our voices united, for the truth and the dream in our hearts
One dream of bravery
A cosmic unity
Our universal glory
The awakening of all mankind
The power of truth from inside
The legions of free men now rise
Legions!!
