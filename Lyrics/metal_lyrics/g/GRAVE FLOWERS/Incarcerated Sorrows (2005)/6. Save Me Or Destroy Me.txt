I can't stand to be awake
Let me die before I crack
I can't sleep cause it twists in me
Take me away without dignity
Save me or destroy me cause I can't live on
I'm just a stranger to life
Save me or destroy me I never meant to be wrong
I can't do it on my own
It burns inside like a giant flame
I've never felt a worse pain
I am a freak, don't look at me
If you got rules, just set me free
Save me or destroy me cause I can't live on
I'm just a stranger to life
Save me or destroy me I never meant to be wrong
I can't do it on my own
I walk around in circles
Cause I can't sit still
The anguish boils inside me
Like a flame it's eating me
Please make the pain go away
The guilt and the shame
Can I stand to face another day
If I die would you visit my grave
