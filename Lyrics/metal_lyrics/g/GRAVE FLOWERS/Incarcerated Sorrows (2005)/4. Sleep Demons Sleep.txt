Late at night alone again
Has ceased to think and understand
I'm introvert nothing pleases me
I'm on the edge please set me free
Why can't my demons sleep, why can't they surrender
They are bringing me down they are cold as december
Why can't my demons sleep, why can't they surrender
Am I meant to feel this way, feel this way forever
I'm dead inside like a dry old sea
Don't want to be part of reality
Get more depressed for every day
Some call it life, I call it hell to pay
Why can't my demons sleep, why can't they surrender
They are bringing me down they are cold as december
Why can't my demons sleep, why can't they surrender
Am I meant to feel this way, feel this way forever
A dishearten lullaby they sing for me
They don't want me to fall asleep
Feel like snakes are living inside of me
Flowing through my veins
They remind me of reality and misery
Everytime I close my eyes they appear
Wants to get rid of the pressure and feel some harmony
I'm not the man that I used to be
Why can't my demons sleep, why can't they surrender
They are bringing me down they are cold as december
Why can't my demons sleep, why can't they surrender
Am I meant to feel this way, feel this way forever
