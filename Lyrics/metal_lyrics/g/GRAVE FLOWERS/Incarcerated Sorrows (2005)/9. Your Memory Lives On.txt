Deep within my heart your memory will live on
Always thought that you were that special one
Now we are left alone, so empty without you
Never to come back again, what are we to do
You were an angel, a beauty to behold
Now your wings you may unfold
Left your throne for good, left us all alone
But inside of me your memory will live on
Can't forget your smile, I see you night and day
How I miss you dear, I wish that you could stay
The story of an angel, that sure needs to be told
An angel who's wings now may unfold
It's destiny that brings life to an end
But why you I can't understand
Come back, come back my friend
In my heart thrives your memory to forever live on
