Once upon a time I was not afraid
To face this thing called life
I don't know who's to blame
But there is no happiness in sight
Once upon a time I was happy
I wish I could be again
All I see is darkness
And my eyes are not closed
I'm living in a passed dream
I don't know where it will end this time
All my greater moments are gone
I wish I could freeze the time
Think back to the time when I was younger
I thought it would work it out by itself
I have only grown older
Things ahead of me I just want to forget
I'm living in a passed dream
I don't know where it will end this time
All my greater moments are gone
I wish I could freeze the time
From inside comes the fear that brings me down
Wishing I could go back into a memory
From inside comes the fear that brings me down
Wishing I could get rid of reality
