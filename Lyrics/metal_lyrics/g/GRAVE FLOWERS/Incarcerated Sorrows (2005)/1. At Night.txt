I want to be embraced
Cause I am so sad
I want to be hidden
From this world
I have reached the point
When nothing pleases me
Looking in the mirror
And hate what I see
At night I wake up and want someone by my side
At night I wake up sometimes I want to cry
At night I wake up I feel better than yesterday
At night I wake up think about the things I want to say
Can you tell?
By looking at me
I'm not feeling well
I'm trapped in misery
Open up your eyes
Take a look at the world
It's them and not me
Who's are disturbed
At night I wake up and want someone by my side
At night I wake up sometimes I want to cry
At night I wake up I feel better than yesterday
At night I wake up think about the things I want to say
Is there a pattern to follow
I must have lost the track somewhere
I'm longing for a new tomorrow
Cause this night is filled with despair
