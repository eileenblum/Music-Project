You can not save me now, nobody can
This is my final night, this is the end
I already know the place, no one can find
I will be walking there and become blind
The words you said to me, has grown into pain
Tears and misery falls like a rain
No more alone in darkness
No more pain and fights
Can you forgive me all
This is my final night
I hope you understand, this was my choice
You all think I'm weak, I heard a voice
Promised me so much good, no one done before
Why should I stay here, it's time to close the door
Think of me once in a while, I hope you all do
I'm buried in the ground but I'm thinking of you
No more alone in darkness
No more pain and fights
Can you forgive me all
This is my final night
