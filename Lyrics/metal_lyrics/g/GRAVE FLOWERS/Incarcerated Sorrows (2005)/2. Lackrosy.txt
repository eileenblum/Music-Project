I hide myself in me and I always will
Overdose of reality has made me ill
Have I spent to much time alone?
I curse myself for being born
When everything drowns in black, there is no turning back
And I don't want to be seen
I hide from reality, I'm scared like a child
Don't come close to me
There is no hope, no joy only anguish that bites
And cuts me like a knife
This is how it feels to be me, do you want to
Take over my life?
Lift me from this abyss where I dwell
Please save me from my private hell
Don't judge, just listen if I speak
No I won't reveal it makes me weak
When everything drowns in black, there is no turning back
And I don't want to be seen
I hide from reality, I'm scared like a child
Don't come close to me
There is no hope, no joy only anguish that bites
And cuts me like a knife
This is how it feels to be me, do you want to
Take over my life?
Dark in room and I'm lying in my bed
Trying to figuring out when I became so sad
Is there a hope and a life for me
I need my dreams more than reality
When everything drowns in black, there is no turning back
And I don't want to be seen
I hide from reality, I'm scared like a child
Don't come close to me
There is no hope, no joy only anguish that bites
And cuts me like a knife
This is how it feels to be me, do you want to
Take over my life?
