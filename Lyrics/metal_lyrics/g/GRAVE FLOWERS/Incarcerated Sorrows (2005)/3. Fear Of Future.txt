How many tradgedies will follow in a lifetime?
How many sad eyes has to be closed and die?
No more tears are falling, will be the begining for others
Escape to avoid sorrow or become another
The fear of future
Has made me hollow
The lies they tell you
You easily swallow
How many weak people will be mislead by sects?
How many wars can we start before we all disappear?
Deeper and deeper are we sinking into the depths of hell
Nothing can ever save us, not even a spell
The fear of future
Has made me hollow
The lies they tell you
You easily swallow
Will darkness dispel and will the pressure go away
I'm fragile like a leaf on a winter's day
My hope is gone and I'm so afraid
Close my eyes and hope it all goes away
I'm crumbling down like ashes in the wind
I isolate myself to become less negative
Will I be able to feel secure
Wherever I go, I hear the death's call
DIE
