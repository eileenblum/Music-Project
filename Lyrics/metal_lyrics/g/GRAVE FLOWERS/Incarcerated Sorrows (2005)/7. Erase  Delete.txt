Augustnight looking back at my life
What I've done and been put through
I've hurt and been wounded
That's the way life's treating you
Some things I just want to remember
Other things I just want to erase
Walk through life is not tender
Close my eyes and try to forget
Delete this from my mind
Erase the way I felt
Don't let it happen again
I have to take a life
Painful thoughts and insecurity
Kind of feelings I occupy
I have been able to forgive
But it will always be printed in my mind
Why am I always the chosen one
Must be something I've done wrong
Life is cursed and I don't know
If I'm able to go on
Delete this from my mind
Erase the way I felt
Don't let it happen again
I have to take a life
Of all pain I've gone through
This one has been the worst
No matter how I try to forget it
It keeps on coming back
It's like the words are saying
You can forgive but you can't forget
Here I am in the darkness
Wants to erase some of my past
