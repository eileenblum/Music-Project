Itâs so dark outside even if the morning has arrived
The snow is shimering white bringing tears to his eyes
Today he will walk the woods and probably take his life
The reason to live is gone since he lost his wife

No more winters no more pain or lonley nights
I have felt so alone but soon Iâll be by your side

He feel the cold winds blowing towards his face
He will be leaving this earth and the human race
Feel so empty inside no feelings in his mind
Walking deeper into the woods to find a place to die

No more winters no more pain or lonley nights
I have felt so alone but soon Iâll be by your side
No more winters no more pain or lonley nights
Death will unite us so I donât have to cry

I dream of you at night
When I close my eyes
I see your face
You are on the other side
I will cross that river
to show you my grace
All those memories
they hurt so much
I canât stand to be alive

I hear you calling me
and I get so warm inside
Iâm longing to touch your skin
now I will say goodbye
Iâm going to leave this earth
are you waiting for me
Cause Iâm coming tonight
no more winters in sight
