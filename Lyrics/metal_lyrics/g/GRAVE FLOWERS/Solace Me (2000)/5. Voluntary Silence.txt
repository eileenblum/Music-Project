So many words are buried in my mind
I donât speak my piece Iâll keep it all inside
No one really knows what I have to say
I wonât reveal myself  I donât work that way

I donât waste my words
I speak when I feel
and when I have something to say
But sometimes I feel so down
that I donât even move my mouth
those days you better stay away

I wish people could see the expression on my face
If you donât get it then which is my strongest trace
Something is wrong and I donât care to explain
Thatâs my fault and I give myself the pain

I donât waste my words
I speak when I feel
and when I have something to say
But sometimes I feel so down
that I donât even move my mouth
those days you better stay away

Donât force me to speak and explore myself
I'll let you in if you give of yourself
Locked up words can cause grief and pain
Words spoken without a care can bring the same

I donât waste my words
I speak when I feel
and when I have something to say
But sometimes I feel so down
that I donât even move my mouth
those days you better stay away
