Dark night you came to me
filled with anguish and misery
Do I dare to close my eyes
there is nowhere I can hide

All alone and embraced by darkness
anguish haunting me so I canât sleep
Longing for the morninglight to surround me
cause every night I fear for my dreams

When morning comes I feel so calm
lights surrounds me and the night is far
But soon I will be there again
when I close my eyes Iâm damned

All alone and embraced by darkness
anguish haunting me so I canât sleep
Longing for the morninglight to surround me
cause every night I fear for my dreams

If I fall asleep, maybe they take me away
The thought makes me weep, Iâm starting to pray
I have gathered all my fear, if I fall asleep Iâll die
So Iâm sitting here and wonder about life
