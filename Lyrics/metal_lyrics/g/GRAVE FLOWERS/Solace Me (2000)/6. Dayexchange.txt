Do you want to trade a day with me
I get yours and you get mine for free
I have turned my days into nights
anything to avoid the daylight

I must be stupid cause I feel such  shame
I am a failure and have no one to blame
I wish I could be happy and smile
for heavenâs sake I canât even cry

Welcome to my misery
Iâm gonna guide you through
We will take the easy way
I think itâs best for you

I must be stupid cause I feel such  shame
I am a failure and have no one to blame
I wish I could be happy and smile
for heavenâs sake I canât even cry

I have seen so many pictures of the life I want
I have longed in vain but there is nothing to talk about
Am I just wasting my time, or am I doing fine
gimme a ticket to paradise and I will say goodbye

Everything for you is back to normal
was it as good as you imagined
I guess you canât compare with heaven
but youâre welcome back for a trade any day

I must be stupid cause I feel such  shame
I am a failure and have no one to blame
I wish I could be happy and smile
for heavenâs sake I canât even cry
