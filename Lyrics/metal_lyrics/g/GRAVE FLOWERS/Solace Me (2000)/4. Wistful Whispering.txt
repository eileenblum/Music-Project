I see your beautiful face
when you lie and sleep
Your face looks so pale
and you sleep so deep
I wonât realize
that you will leave me soon
The sickness that youâve got
itâs going to end your life

Iâm sitting by your side
and I hold your hand
I canât hold back my tears
Iâm so afraid
I hear you whisper my name
and you sound so weak
You just closed your eyes
and told me goodbye

In my hour of sorrow, Iâm screaming why
You have just left me, Iâm standing by your side
You look so beautiful, I cannot hide my tears
Now Iâm all alone after all these years
I will never forget you, you will always be on my mind
You were so special, you were one of a kind
