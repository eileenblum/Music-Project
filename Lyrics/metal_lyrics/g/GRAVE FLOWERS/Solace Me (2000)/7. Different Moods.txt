In the fields of loneliness
Iâm standing lost again
I wish I could tell you
how I feel inside

Life isnât a dream thatâs going on forever
when Iâm dead and gone I hope Iâm feeling better

I canât describe my emotions
canât put them into words
I do not often cry
I want love but I just hide

Life isnât a dream thatâs going on forever
when Iâm dead and gone I hope Iâm feeling better

I have felt the bitterness
I have felt the joy
Iâve been in different moods
all my life
No state seems to please me
I wonder who I am
My flame for life is fading
save me if you can

In the death valley lonley
Iâm standing lost and cold
My flame is burned out
Iâm no longer alive

Life isnât a dream thatâs going on forever
when Iâm dead and gone I hope Iâm feeling better
