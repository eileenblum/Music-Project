Waking up alone
and my dream is gone
Face another day

Iâm feeling cold
my soul has holes
That will never heal

Iâm so sick inside
got a twisted mind
Can no longer cope

I wish I could be happy but reality hurts
It brings me down and makes me lick the dirt

Looking back at life
then I realize
Iâm not meant to be

How did I end up here
is it cause I fear
The world outside

I canât hear a sound
and I canât look out
Mostly my eyes are shut

I fear for my tomorrow cause it might be like yesterday
I felt all the sorrow and I cried in vain

Looking at the white walls with tears in my eyes
I donât know why Iâm here and why Iâm alive
Itâs so cold in here and no one hears me cry
When death calls my name Iâll gladly say goodbye

Night will soon be here
then I disappear
Into my own world

No one can hurt me there
and I feel no fear
Embraced by tranquility

Please donât let me wake
my body shakes
I have left my life

Now Iâm happy and reality doesnât hurt
Iâm underground, Iâm buried in the dirt
No white walls surrounds me, now Iâm free to fly
To leave this earth was a good way to say goodbye
