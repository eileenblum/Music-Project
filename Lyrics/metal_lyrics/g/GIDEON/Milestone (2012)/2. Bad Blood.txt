He always heard that family comes first
But walk a mile in his shoes
You'll see that family hurts
Just an innocent boy full of life
But that coward left him with nothing

You, you were never family
Now I'm leaving you behind
You took me for granted
I'm letting go
You can save your goodbyes

Years go by, three kids and a wife
But it's still eating him alive
A life of struggle and strife
But he won't give up this fight

He always heard that family comes first
And this time he'll make sure of it
He tries to hide the pain
Thinks back to that time and place
Stares that coward in the face
And he screams...

You, you were never family
Now I'm leaving you behind
You took me for granted
I'm letting go
You can save your goodbyes

You'll never know what you put me through
Now I'm leaving you behind
Spineless
Now I'm leaving you behind
Spineless
You can save your goodbyes
