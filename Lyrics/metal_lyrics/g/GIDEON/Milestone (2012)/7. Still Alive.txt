[feat. Matt Honeycutt of Kublai Khan]All life lay ahead and every road led home
You stood by me shoulder to shoulder

Looking back
All of it has happened so fast
It's all a blur
I'll always stay thankful for the past
And look forward to the future

This life has thrown us curves
But it's worth every lesson we've learned
Thick or thin

Through good or bad
I will stand up for you in the end
I will stand up for you in the end

Is this the last real taste of innocence?
Or the first real taste of life?
The memories we hold
Are helping us survive
The memories we hold on to are keeping us alive

All life lay ahead and every road led home
You stood by me shoulder to shoulder
Years go by, I'm getting older
But we'll stand together, shoulder to shoulder

My brother
My friend
My brother

Remember how simple life used to be?
Nothing could stop us from who we wanted to be

Stay young
Stay free
Stay young
Stay free

All life lay ahead and every road led home
You stood by me shoulder to shoulder
Years go by, I'm getting older
But we'll stand together, shoulder to shoulder
You stood by me shoulder to shoulder...
