Restoration

This is the last time
I will choose to run from the ones that I love
A young man that was full of pride
That was full of self regard
Forgiveness you still show
A prideful youth that I'll never get back
You carried my weight
Forgiveness you still show

This is the last time that I'll run from the ones that I love
I am the Prodigal Son
I will no longer run
I am the Prodigal Son

Now I'm older and I can see the truth
The sacrifices you made for the life that you would struggle through
A prideful youth that I'll never get back
You carried my weight
Forgiveness you still show

I never knew how much you meant to me
And now I'm taking it back
I used to count down the days that I'd leave with my selfish ways
I'm taking it back
With the love that you have shown me
And the man that you have molded me to be
I'm taking it back

You were my Restoration
Restoration
