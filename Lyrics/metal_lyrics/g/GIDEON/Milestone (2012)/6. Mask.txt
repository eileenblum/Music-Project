There is nothing that you can say to me
That will take me from the place that I am meant to be
So-called friends turn their backs and run
Convenience is the only thing they do not shun

Is this just another smile?
Is this just another mask you wear?
The friendly faces, in every day new places
Who is real and why is it so rare?

Why is it so rare?
Why is it so rare?

The gratitude that I hold so closely
Is for the ones who always see the truth and trust it solely
A companion
A closest friend
The only thing that will matter in the end

Is this just another smile?
Is this just another mask you wear?
The friendly faces, in every day new places
Who is real and why is it so rare?
Is this just another smile?
Is this just another mask you wear?
The friendly faces, in every day new places
Who is real and why is it so rare?
