Gutless excuse for a man

Too many times I've watched you raise your hand against my family
Too many hours hiding in my closet praying for
The strength to do something
To put an end to this

Woman, why are you still there?
The fear of leaving should not outweigh the fear of staying
You don't deserve this
My diamond in the rough
You deserve the world
My diamond in the rough
Don't let anyone tell you different
Don't let anyone ever tell you different

I will never understand what she saw in you
All the pain and suffering you put this family though
You are nothing to me but a gutless child
You're nothing to me

Woman, why are you still there?
The fear of leaving should not outweigh the fear of staying
You don't deserve this
My diamond in the rough

Show me a man who abuses the bottle
I'll show you a broken family
You don't have to put up with this
There is a way out
There is always a way out
There is always a way out
There is always a way out
