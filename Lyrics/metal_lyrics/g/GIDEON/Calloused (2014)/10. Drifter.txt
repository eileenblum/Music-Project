I come and go like the tide
Drifting like the wind on the open road
But this location is my destination
I'm always on my way back home
I used to be a part of your wing
Now I'm just a feather
I was always right by your side
Now I'm a drifter (drifter)
Wherever I go wherever I roam
I wont forget the place I call home
Wherever I go wherever I roam
This will always, always be my
Hometown hold me tight
I'm only here for one more night
I'm only here for one more night
(and I'm singin')
Hometown hold me tight
Cause I don't mind wasting my time
So hometown hold me tight
I come and go like the tide
Return like the seasons
So shine your beacon light
I'll give you my reasons
I'm sorry for leaving
I wish we could be
Frozen in time with this memory
Make the clock stop!
And stop time with me
(drifter)
Wherever I go wherever I roam
This will always, always be my
Hometown hold me tight
I'm only here for one more night
I'm only here for one more night
(and I'm singin')
Hometown hold me tight
Cause I don't mind wasting my time
So hometown hold me tight
