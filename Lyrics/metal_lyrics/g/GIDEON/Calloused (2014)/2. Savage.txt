Face to face with my demons again
A constant struggle a never ending war from within
So bring it on let the battle begin
You keep trying my patience itâs wearing thin
Lets skip the basics I don't care how you've been
Get out of my head out of my skin
With one final blow one last swing
K.O.
I'll be the last man standing
Paralyze resistance with persistence
K.O.
I'll be the last man standing
Blood. Sweat. Drive.
Do you have what it takes to survive? (come on!)
Never cave Never fold
Never the easy road for the brave and the bold
(I said) Never cave Never fold
I'll be the last man standing (the last man standing)
About-face from my demons at last
Eyes set on the prize and I'm not looking back
Walking through shards of glass from shattered fears of my past
I'll stop at nothing ready for attack
A savage wolf at the door
I'm always hungry for more
Don't try to stop me cause I-
I ain't got nothin' to lose
Never cave Never fold
Never the easy road for the brave and the bold
(I said) Never cave Never fold
I'll be the last man standing (the last man standing)
Blood. Sweat. Drive.
Do you have what it takes to survive?
