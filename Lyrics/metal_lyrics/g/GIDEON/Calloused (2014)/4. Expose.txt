I will expose, bear the scars
Forever scream in the memory of the broken hearts
Wave the flag for the cheated, the let down, defeated
Carry the torch!
Suffer the cause shatter the reality
My stomach's sick from disregard of actuality
Recognize the lives cut short the victims of last resort
Destroy the sound of silence
Bring light to the violence
I will expose, bear the scars
Forever scream in the memory of the broken hearts
Wave the flag for the cheated, the let down, defeated
Carry the torch! For the abandoned ones left empty handed
Carry the torch! For the cheated, the let down, defeated
Carry the torch!
These are the sons and the daughters
The mothers and fathers we love
Precious life ended abrupt then itâs just swept under the rug
3,000 people today crushed by the weight
Too heavy to hold they took their lives away
Recognize the lives cut short the victims of last resort
Carry the torch! For the abandoned ones left empty handed
Carry the torch! For the cheated, the let down, defeated
Carry the torch!
I will bear these scars for the broken hearts
