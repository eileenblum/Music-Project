[feat. Caleb Shomo Of Beartooth]Be the victim or claim the victory
Move past your fears so you can finally be free
Push through the pain (pain!) you canât be afraid
You wonât see the sun until you walk through the rain
Fall, get up, repeat
Welcome the hard times
Rise in defeat
Fall, get up, repeat
Keep moving don't stop for anything
Inhale the struggle exhale the trouble
Bear your cross with honor even when your knees buckle
And don't forget where you came from
Your determination will determine the man you become
Breathe life breathe life
Survive
Are you afraid to die? Afraid to be alive?
This time I've made up my mind and I'm not wasting time
Survival of the fittest
Survive! Survive!
This is your life (hey!) so come out swinging
Stop sitting in silence start kicking and screaming
Push through the hate (hey!)
Don't give them reasons to say
They were right you were wrong you couldn't go all the way
Fall, get up, repeat
Welcome the hard times
Rise in defeat
Fall, get up, repeat
Keep moving don't stop for anything
Breathe life breathe life
Survive
Are you afraid to die? Afraid to be alive?
This time I've made up my mind and I'm not wasting time
Survival of the fittest
Survive! Survive!
Adversity devours the weak
If you want it go and get it
Be relentless
We are relentless!
Adversity devours the weak
If you want it go and get it
We are relentless
Relentless
