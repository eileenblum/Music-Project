Wake me up
I'm stuck in this bad dream
I'm wide awake but I must be sleeping
Or over-thinking, sinking, hoping, wishing
That I'll just find peace
(help me) My reflection staring back at me (save me)
Is this the man you always wanted to be?
Look at me looking back at me
Can I trust the man I see?
Behind these prison eyes
I find it hard to sleep (find it hard to breathe)
With all the secrets that I keep
Behind these prison eyes
It took 3 long years for the floor to cave
It took 2 steps back to see you weren't okay
It took 1 hard look in the mirror (it's clearer)
Now I count down the days until I go insane
I don't feel safe inside my head anymore
Nothing's the same as it was before
Trapped in my own skin
My mind is racing, I cannot stop pacing back and forth
I don't feel safe inside my head anymore
Look at me looking back at me
Can I trust the man I see?
Behind these prison eyes
I find it hard to sleep (find it hard to breathe)
With all the secrets that I keep
Behind these prison eyes
Look at me looking back at me
Haunted by old memories
Look at me looking back at me
God grant me some kind of peace
Wake me up!
Look at me looking back at me
Can I trust the man I see?
Behind these prison eyes
I find it hard to sleep (find it hard to breathe)
With all the secrets that I keep
Behind these prison eyes
