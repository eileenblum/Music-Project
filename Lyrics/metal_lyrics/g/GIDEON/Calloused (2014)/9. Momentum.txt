Momentum. Falling back to you
I've become broken fragments, shattered, torn in two
Momentum. Bring me back to you
And finish what you started, finish what you started in me
Lost love I lost myself
Why did I put so much weight into somebody else?
Lost heart I should've known from the start
Instead I stood by and watched as my world fell apart
When the storm rolled in and the waves came crashing down
I sank straight to the bottom held my breath
Then you pulled me up and pulled me in
Momentum. Falling back to you
I've become broken fragments, shattered, torn in two
Momentum. Bring me back to you
And finish what you started, finish what you started in me
Lost faith simply out of spite
I turned my back on the one that's always by my side
Lost hope forgot my roots
This time I plant my feet and I promise
Promise not to move
They say you don't know what you got âtil it's gone
Well it took losing everything to find you were there all along
When the storm rolled in and the waves came crashing down
I sank straight to the bottom held my breath
Then you pulled me up and pulled me in
Momentum. Falling back to you
I've become broken fragments, shattered, torn in two
Momentum. Bring me back to you
And finish what you started, finish what you started in me
