I feel like I've been here before
Maybe in a pipe dream when I was 16
Sittin' in class watchin' the minute hand pass
And my mind only on one thing
If I could go, If I could see
If I could make my dreams a reality
I want to touch the song I hear
That's been ringing inside of me for years
And you can watch from the sidelines
No limits running through my mind
I found the pulse and this heartâs alive
No limits running through my mind
So clear the clouds I'm gonna chase
Chase the sky
I feel like I've been here before
Maybe in a pipe dream now itâs the real thing
I'm living too fast to sit and watch the time pass
Sun shinin' drip dryin' in Sydney
I'll watch the sun go down in a foreign town
Head still in the clouds with both feet on the ground
Forever living loud
Can you hear me now?
If sky's the limit I'm gonna tear it down
We're gonna tear it down!
And you can watch from the sidelines
No limits running through my mind
I found the pulse and this heartâs alive
No limits running through my mind
So clear the clouds I'm gonna chase
Chase the sky
If sky's the limit we're gonna tear it down
Tear it down!
