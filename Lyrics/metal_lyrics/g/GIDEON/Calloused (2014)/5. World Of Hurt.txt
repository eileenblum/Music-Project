A picture perfect world of hurt
A self destructing work of art
She hit the bottom before her life could truly start
10 years young she lost her mother
Everyday feeling out of place like a storm without thunder (a deep breath without air)
Left with a heart that was punctured
Every day trying to escape
Now she sits there and wonders why life's so unfair
Searching
Still searching for so much more
Is there life beyond that door? (knock knock)
A self destructing work of art
A picture perfect world of hurt
7 years of pretending she's fine
Acting out a fantasy but it's hell in her mind (tears in her eyes)
She's at the end of the line and she decided to tie a noose at the end this time
Searching
Still searching for so much more
Is there life beyond that door? (knock knock)
A self destructing work of art
A picture perfect world of hurt
Lower than ever before but you're worth so much more
Stuck inside this world of hurt
So don't tell me tell me you're okay
The truth hurts but hit me with it anyway
You're my flesh and blood a part of me
And when you bleed I bleed
A self destructing work of art
She hit the bottom before her life could truly start
Searching
Still searching for so much more
Is there life beyond that door? (knock knock)
A self destructing work of art
A picture perfect world of hurt
