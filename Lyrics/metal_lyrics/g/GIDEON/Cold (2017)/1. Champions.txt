Go

Born to believe anything
So sure that you can see it all clearly
Feeling your way through the dark
Set up to fail hand over heart

Cut the lights do you feel in control
Cut the lights do you feel all alone
My eyes have finally adjusted
I'm seeing red 
I'm seeing red
Yeah I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red

'Cause we were born born to believe in anything
I'll never stop I'll never stop give it up
Born born to believe anything
Seize the moment all or nothing

Champions
Dare to be (dare to be)
Champions
Leave your legacy
I'm not the only one tired of running
Seize the moment all or nothing
Seize the moment its all or not

Seize the moment its all all for nothing again
Dreams die you wake up in the end
That's what they want you to think
Fall back in line its all out of reach

But as I'm facing the crowd
I see your face in the crowd and you're just like me
Fed up and torn at the seams

'Cause we were born born to believe in anything
I'll never stop I'll never stop give it up
Born born to believe anything
Seize the moment all or nothing

Champions
Dare to be (dare to be)
Champions
Leave your legacy
I'm not the only one tired of running
Seize the moment all or nothing
Seize the moment its all or not

Seize the moment all or nothing
Seize the moment its all or not
Seize the moment all or nothing
Seize the moment

This is where the rubber meets the road
Where its do or die where you go at it alone
And you don't stop 'til you get there
Where the rubber meets the road
Where its do or die where you go at it alone
And you don't stop 

Change your world
Dare to be
