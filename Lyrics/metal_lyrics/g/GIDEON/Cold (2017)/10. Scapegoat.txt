Close minded fool
Hide behind your pathetic point of view
And I know and I know it's sad but true
I never needed a scapegoat but I guess you do (I know you do)

Close minded self righteous
Nothing more than a virus
Ignorance at its finest
You're just a useless bigot in your own state of grace
No remorse for your hate
Changing faces to save face

Living in black and white
You judge a book by its cover
Weak minded fool
What gives you the right
To judge one man from another
This ignorance will die with you
(Coward)
Hide your pathetic point of view
And I know I know it's sad but true
I never needed a scapegoat but I guess you do (I know you do)

Cut the neck
We all bleed red
We all bruise black and blue
You'll get what's coming to you
Selfish dispositions
Loud mouth opinions
A lifetime of lies that lie so far from the truth

Living in black and white
You judge a book by its cover
Weak minded fool
What gives you the right
To judge one man from another
This ignorance will die with you
(This ignorance will die with you)

Living in black and white
You judge a book by its cover
Weak minded fool
What gives you the right
To judge one man from another
This ignorance will die with you

Living in black and white
You judge a book by its cover
Weak minded fool
What gives you the right

You have no power
Racist coward
No power
Racist coward
