My father told me this is how it would be
But you never see it coming when your seventeen
Time marches on with the fading faces
The only thing that stays the same is everything changes

We spent those days full of hope and expectation
And most of the time we were bound to miss (bound to miss)
But I had your back and we held tight to our aspirations
It never crossed my mind that it would come to this

Now it's come to this
I've been chasing ghosts
Losing my mind
Everyone's moving on
I must be falling behind
But I'm still alive still alive
Dead set on staying young and free
'Cause I'm still alive still alive
Am I killing time or is it killing me

I remember the night the bitter taste of goodbye
You felt it too I could see it in your eyes
We stood the test of time but could we stand the test of change
I knew in that moment we'd never be the same
Walk away everything changes
Time marches on with the fading faces
The only thing that stays the same is everything changes

Now it's come to this
I've been chasing ghosts
Losing my mind
Everyone's moving on
I must be falling behind
But I'm still alive still alive
Dead set on staying young and free
'Cause I'm still alive still alive
Am I killing time or is it killing me

Thick or thin my brother my friend
I will stand up for you in the end

My father told me this is how it would be
But you never see it coming when you're seventeen
Thick or thin my brother my friend
I will stand up for you in the end
