Resist and conquer
Trivial lives misused and seduced to our own demise
This is betrayal
Throw me away on the front line
Put a price tag on my head and force us all to play
This is betrayal
Throw me away (throw me away)

When it's time for me to get low
And they sink my body six feet below
Was I just another voice ignored
Another piece on the board
Another victim of trust

Dust to dust
This is our time to rise
Dust to dust
And prove we're more than just
Dust to dust

This is not a test
This is rebirth
This is a threat
Resist and conquer
I'm not your sacrifice
I'm not your lamb to the slaughter
Resist and conquer

Life is a fight to the death
I started fighting as I took my first step
And I'll be fighting when I take my last breath
Nothing was handed to me
The LVP living in the shadows of the kings and queens
Waited patiently now you're right where I need you to be

When it's time for me to get low
And they sink my body six feet below
Was I just another voice ignored
Another piece on the board
Another victim of trust
Dust to dust

This is our time to rise
Dust to dust
And prove we're more than just
Dust to dust
Prove we're more than just
Dust to dust

Resist and conquer
