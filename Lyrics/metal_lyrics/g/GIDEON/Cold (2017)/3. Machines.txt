You will not own me (you will not own me)
You cannot hold me

We are broken and beaten down
A bitter breed now
Welcome to the new age
Where we drape the pain and ache for days
Where the world was a better place
We seem to be torn between
The future and the past but the past is just a memory
The free enslaved
No voice no soul we are machines

(You cannot hold me down)

Are we too blind to see
They took the light from our eyes and told us to believe
You will not own me
Cannot hold me down I am not your machine

Broken and beaten down
A dying breed now
You want to take my life from me
Control and divide
Fill the air with your lies
'Til there's nothing left to breathe
We seem to be torn between
A lifetime of fear and a fight for humanity
It's time the free ignite
One voice one soul we rise and fight fight fight

You will not own me
You cannot hold me down

Are we too blind to see
They took the light from our eyes and told us to believe
You will not own me
Cannot hold me down I am not your machine

Not your machine
Not your machine
Drop
Not your machine
