[feat. Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed]Freedom over fear
Freedom over all weakness
Freedom over all the lies
With your fist clenched tight in the air tonight
With your fist clenched tight
Throw it up

Stepping out I can remember
Steeping out I can recall
The southern nights and the feel of forever
Never noticed our backs against the wall

It's the same when you ain't got a chance in hell
But fuel to my fire is the voice telling me I was born to fail
So go and run your mouth
Word gets around in the deep south
It's time to cut the ties with a fist clenched tight
Throw it at the sky sing

Freedom over fear
Freedom over all weakness
Freedom over all the lies
With your fist clenched tight in the air tonight
Sing
Freedom over fear
Freedom over all weakness
Freedom over all the lies
With your fist clenched tight in the air tonight

They called us fools but we had nothing to lose
Turn our backs to the past and our eyes to the moon
We're looking up up up and they keep looking down
On everyone who tries to leave this town

Growing up growing numb we're not the same night and day not a chance in hell
You're the fuel to my fire you're the voice telling me I was born to fail
So go and run your mouth
Word gets around in the underground

Let em talk let em talk
Their words mean nothing at all
Let em walk let em walk
Never been one for the dead weight
Let em fall
Let em talk let em talk
Let em waste their breath
We don't care at all
Let em walk let em walk
Never been one for the dead weight
Let em fall
Let em talk let em talk
Their words mean nothing at all
Let em walk let em walk
Never been one for the dead weight
Let em fall

With a fist clenched tight
Throw it at the sky sing

Freedom over fear
Freedom over all weakness
Freedom over all the lies
With your fist clenched tight in the air tonight
Sing
Freedom over fear
Freedom over all weakness
Freedom over all the lies
With your fist clenched tight in the air tonight
With a fist clenched tight
