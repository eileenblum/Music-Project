I've wandered I've strayed
Left home went searching
So many questions remain
This world left me cold
Gave me a heart of stone

It's safe to say I'm not the same

Renegade
The choice I made to walk alone it's the price you pay
I've grown into a thicker skin thicker skin
I've had enough if giving in
'Cause I'm a renegade
This is the choice I made to walk alone and embrace the pain
Born this way (born this way)
Die this way (die this way)
Renegade

Too many fakes too many frauds
Nobody speaks for themselves
Well I've been thinking thinking it's time
Time for me to rebel

'Cause I'm a renegade
The choice I made to walk alone it's the price you pay
I've grown into a thicker skin thicker skin
I've had enough if giving in
'Cause I'm a renegade
This is the choice I made to walk alone and embrace the pain
Born this way (born this way)
Die this way (die this way)
A renegade (renegade)

I won't ask nobody for nothing
If I can't get it on my own (on my own)
So if you don't like the way I'm living
Well just leave me alone

Born this way die this way
Born this way die this way
Oo
Renegade

I've wandered I've strayed
Left home went searching
One thing remains
I'm not the same
