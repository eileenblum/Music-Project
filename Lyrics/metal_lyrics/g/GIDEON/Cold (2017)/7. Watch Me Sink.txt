You are my last setting sun

Stubborn and hollow
Who holds your cure
Reject the loyal
Repel and endure

Nothing is clear
Push and pull 'til there's no one here
Push and pull 'til they all disappear

The sun was stolen from the horizon

Misery loves company
My faith in you will be the death of me
You can't escape the gravity (dragging you down)
Life is tragic when you feel like a tragedy
Face the war
Brave the storm

You are my last setting sun

Hard headed and hollow
Who holds my cure
Reject the loyal
And pursue the obscure

I've been chasing your shadow in the dark
But you were gone from the start
False hope for this tired heart

Misery loves company
My faith in you will be the death of me
You can't escape the gravity (dragging you down)
Life is tragic when you feel like a tragedy
Face the war
Brave the storm

Pick at the scabs of my wounds so they never heal
I ask myself if you were ever real
I always knew you would run
You are my last setting sun

Pick at the scabs if my wounds so they never heal
I ask myself if you were ever real
A lost cause is just a mirage
Now watch me sink sink sink
Straight down to the bottom

The sun was stolen from the horizon

Misery loves company
My faith in you will be the death of me
You can't escape the gravity (dragging you down)
Life is tragic when you feel like a tragedy
Face the war
Brave the storm

I will brave the storm
