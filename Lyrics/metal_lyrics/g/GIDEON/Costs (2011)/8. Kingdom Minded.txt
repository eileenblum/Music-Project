You haven't done what I've done
You haven't seen what I've seen
What will we do with life

What will we do with it
Were only here for a moment
One glance a blink of the eye
One chance itâs your only try
What will we do with it
Were only here for a moment.
I donât live twice
Cause I refuse to step back and watch my life go by

Kingdom Minded
I am Kingdom Minded

Living in light of the Kingdom
Living in light of eternity

You haven't done what Iâve done
You haven't been where Iâve been
What will we do with life?
This is no game
You only have one life
