If money makes the world go round, feed them lies to put them in the ground.
Tell them exactly what they want to hear because they all have itching ears.

You are the one that I despise. Instead of love you spread your lies. Again. Again. Again. Again.
So go ahead and prophesy and let the money satisfy.
How can you live your life knowing itâs just a lie?

Here I stand, I can do no other. Truth at all costs.
Here I stand, I can do no other. Truth at all costs.

If money keeps you satisfied, feed them lies as long as you get by.
Hide behind the name of Christ. You are the one I despise.
Instead of life... Instead of love you spread your lies. Again. Again. Again. Again.

Here I stand, I can do no other. Truth at all costs.
Here I stand, I can do no other. Truth at all costs.

I will stand âtil my last breath. I will stand against the lies.
I will stand against the lies, against the pain that youâve caused inside so many lives.
You are the one I despise.
Your words, they seem as though theyâre knives,
sunk deep into their backs and I can hear their cries.
I will defend the truth.

Truth at all costs. Your lifeâs a lie.
