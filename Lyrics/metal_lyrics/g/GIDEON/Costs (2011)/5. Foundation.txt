This foundation you stand on is paper-thin, budging with the wind.
I see you running â running from the truth. I hear the anger â anger in your shaking voice.
You are running in the dark. Stare me in the face and say there is nothing to live for, to die for.

This foundation you stand on is paper-thin, budging with the wind.
Look into my eyes and say there is nothing to live for, to die for.

Wasted life, wasted time, faithless living as this time rolls by.
The pride you carry makes you so weary. Stand on something stronger than yourself.
Stand on something stronger than yourself.

This foundation you stand on is paper-thin, budging with the wind.
Look into my eyes and say there is nothing to live for, to die for.

Wasted life, wasted time, faithless living as this time rolls by.
Wasted life, wasted time, faithless living as this time rolls by.
