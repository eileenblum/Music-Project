You need a gutcheck. Got me on my knees praying for you.
You did this for me, now Iâm doing this for you.
Your lack of faith is making me sick.
The only thing left is dealing with it. (dealing with it)

They said question everything, but I still believe.
When all my friends have picked up and gone, I still believe.

Spit you out... Spit you out. I spit you out my mouth.
