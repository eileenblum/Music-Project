Tell me, tell me, tell me that Iâm going nowhere. Tell me this isnât enough.
I see what they go through. I guess you never had to feel that pain.
Iâve counted the cost. This is where I belong.

So many questions run through my head. Time for us to leave again.
My whole life packed in this van and the road is calling.
Remind me what you said again. How Iâm on the road to nowhere land.
Well, this is what Iâm made for. If only you could understand.

This is what Iâm made for. This is what Iâm made for.
Iâve counted the cost, nothing to lose because He gave me everything Iâve lost.
This is what Iâm made for.

Miles and miles away from home thinking âbout the things I canât let go.
But as sure as the breath inside of me I know that this is where I belong.
I see the hurt, I feel the pain. This is what Iâm made for. Maybe now youâll understand.

Tell me, tell me, tell me that Iâm going nowhere. Tell me this isnât enough.
I see what they go through. I guess you never had to feel that pain.
Iâve counted the cost. This is where I belong. This is where I belong.

I have counted the cost, nothing to lose because He gave me everything Iâve lost.

Tell me, tell me, tell me that Iâm going nowhere. Tell me this isnât enough.
I see what they go through. I guess you never had to feel that pain.
Iâve counted the cost. This is where I belong.
