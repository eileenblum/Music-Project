To attain the nirvana of souls
enter their path and be forgiven
Drown the spirit in hate
free oneself-reincarnate...
Hear the words of life
spoken upon the wind
Come, rise with the darkness
a floating eternity

Purify...
Cleanse the soul
Thank you, Master...

Salvation for sins
in all holy is found
Go fly blindly (with me)
into the end of infinity
hear the sound of nothing
watch the clouds turn black
Far away the sun fades...
...into nowhere...

Purify...
Cleanse the soul
Thank you, Master...

Where am I now?
Oh, please God help me...
It's so cold in the dark...
Get me free
