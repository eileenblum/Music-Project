A lesser creation
through increasing hate
Deny this mortal life
to desolation relate

Lost and stumbling
in dreams astray
Shadows of emotions
broaden thus way

For the closing moment
caressing me so softly
Silent voices call
winds whisper my name

Unfold, spirits appear
dancing, shining abstract
Godforsaken saints...

Lost...

Fuck Jesus Christ...

A lesser creation
Through increasing hate
Deny this mortal life
to desolation relate

Lost and stumbling
in dreams astray
Shadows of emotions
broaden thus way
