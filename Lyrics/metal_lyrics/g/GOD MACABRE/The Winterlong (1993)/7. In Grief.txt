Now let me pass away
in a final blasphemy
To life and the pointless
from what I long to be...

Free...

Groan for life
as it should be
And in grief
I understand the wonder me...

In the name of hate
give me strength to carry on

I kneel in front of me
your gods will never be

Shivering I reclaim those days
absolve from being deferred
Do What Thou Wilt...
I thrive in this world
