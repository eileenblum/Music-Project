Hung up in the slaughterhouse
Man's most vicious machine
Innocent lives are ended here
To serve you as a meal

Spawn of flesh...
Consuming meat...
Corporate death...

Bodies are piled in hundreds
Spilled blood on the factory floor
Horrified screams of utter pain
And humanity is shown the door

Spawn of flesh...
Consuming meat...
Corporate death...

Koshery, the ultimate way
Blood drains in a terrifying death
Choking, in a true nightmare
Staring, twisting for the last breath

Defenseless animals living their life
Never to see the sun
And you are the responsible one
For each day consuming meat

Spawn of flesh...
Consuming meat...
Corporate death...
