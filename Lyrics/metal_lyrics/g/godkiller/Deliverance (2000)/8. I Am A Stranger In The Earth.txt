"turn thee into me,
and have mercy upon me ;
for i am desolate and afflicted.
the troubles of my heart are enlarged :
O bring thou me out of my distresses.
look upon mine affliction and my pain ;
and forgive all my sins"
[Psalm 25:16-18]

"i am gone
like the shadow
when it declineth"
[Psalm 109:23]

"i am a stranger in the earth"
