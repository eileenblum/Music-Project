"i sink in deep mire,
where there is no standing :
i am come into deep waters,
where the floods overflow me.
i am weary of my crying :
my throat is dried :
mine eyes fail
while i wait for my God"
[Psalm 69:2-3]

"save me"
[Psalm 69:1]

"all joy is darkened,
the mirth of the land is gone"

shall men seek death,
and shall not find it ;
and shall desire to die,
and death shall flee from them"
[Revelation 9:6]

"save me, O God"
[Psalm 69:1]
