"are not my days few ?
cease then, and let me alone,
that i may take comfort a little,
before i go whence i shall not return"
[Job 10:20-21]

"we grope for the wall like the blind,
and we grope as if we had no eyes :
we stumble at noonday as in the night ;
we are in desolate places as dead men"
[Isaiah 59:10]

"i should have been 
as though i had not been ;
i should have been
carried from the womb to the grave"
