"wherefore i praised the dead
which are already dead,
more than the living
which are yet alive.
yea, better is he than both they,
which hath not yet been,
who hath not seen the evil work
that is done under the sun"
[Ecclesiastes 4:2-3]

"for in much wisdom is much grief :
and he that increaseth knowledge
increaseth sorrow"
