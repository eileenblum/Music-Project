Open the gate
Feel the wind
Of devastation
Of desolation
Blows like the breath of a thousand vultures
Wheeling above your head

In Nomine Patris Et Filii Et Spiritus Sancti
You know it's coming
Nothing or no-one will save you now
Forsake your life
What's the use of waiting for a salvation?
Now it's too late

Did I do everything I wanted to do?
Did I forget something I could regret?
I know the end is near
I feel cold like ice
It's as if I was already dead
I know our time has come

Open the gate
Hear toll the knell
Kneel down
Pray the lords
Did you ever think about how will be
The end of the world?

It smells like death
It smells like past
Like two thousand years
Like millions of dead men
It smells like...
The end of the world
