For how long shall life be considered as a gift of God?

I'm still in the land of the living
Still alive
But for how long?

Ice-cold
Half-dead
Sick at heart
I'm alive

Anguish Perish End it all I'm alive
Anguish Perish End it all Dead

How many dead?
How many alive?

I'm still in the land of the living
Still alive
But for how long?

Ice-cold
Half-dead
Sick at heart
I'm alive

Anguish Perish End it all I'm alive
Anguish Perish End it all Dead

Dead
