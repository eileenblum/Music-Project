Sometimes I wish I had no past
No future
No history
No family

Sometimes I wish I came from nowhere
And went nowhere
I wish I had nothing to hang on to
Nothing to give me the will to live
Or to die
I wish I was just passing through the years

Sometimes I wish I was out of time
Sometimes I wish I was no-one
Sometimes I wish I was nothing
Sometimes I wish I was no-one
Sometimes I wish I was nothing
I wonder how it is when there's nothing left but silence
