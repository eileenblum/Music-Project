Deep into the dark
We all look for a way out
Is it our eyes?
Light was just an illusion

We all fall into the hole
Sinking into the dust
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Down under ground

And the ache keeps growing
And the pang keeps digging
And the pain keeps creeping
And life keeps fading away

We all fall into the hole
Sinking into the dust
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Down under ground

Deep into the throes of hope
we are all waiting for a sign
But the only thing we cannot doubt about
Is that we have to decline
We see no light
We cannot fight
We live into the night
We are under ground
