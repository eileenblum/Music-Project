Back to reality
For the first time in my life
I thought it was good to be alive
But I was wrong...

The dreams of yesterday faded away
There is no more hope
No more hope

Back to reality
Where all is dull and grey
Where living is everyday an ordeal
Where everything can break down in a split second

What a mess I've made of my life
Will I have the strength to live one more day like today?
Blinded by a past I don't want to see anymore
And a future from where a bleakness is all I can see
What a mess I've made of my life
Will I have the strength to live one more day like today?

Back to reality
For the first time in my life
I thought it was good to be alive
But I was wrong...

The dreams of yesterday faded away
There is no more hope
No more hope
I just can't carry on this way...
