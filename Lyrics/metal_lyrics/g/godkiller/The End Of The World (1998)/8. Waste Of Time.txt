Ignorance is a gift that no-one should lose...

Condemned to live in a world of disaster
Condemned to contemplate our won disaster

Blessed are the poor in spirit
Blessed are the sick
Blessed are the starving
Blessed are the merciful

Blessed I am not
But cursed from birth...
...and for eternity

Like ridiculous puppets we are running after
time
But time slips away
Inexorably
Relentlessly

We will all die
Just slipping away
As if we had never come to life
Just fading away
All of us
