I kneel and shut my eyes
Hoping tomorrow never comes
How could I forget all these dull memories of my life?

Do we have to hope against hope?
Deceiving ourselves with lies
How to keep faith in life as we all fall down one by one?
One by one...

Each new day is another day of suffering
Of shivering flesh
Here in the cold

And as the day is dawning
I know a part of me is getting colder

Compare the joys and pains that occured in your life
And tell me if you want to go on living

I kneel and open my eyes
Wishing today had never come
How could I see in a world where only blind can see?

Do we have to hope against hope?
Deceiving ourselves with lies
How to keep faith in life as we all fall down one by one?
One by one...
