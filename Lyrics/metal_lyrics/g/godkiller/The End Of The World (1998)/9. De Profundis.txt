Let me drift
Stay away from me
I'm bleeding

Let me sleep
For a hundred years
I'm bleeding

What will be my very last words?
I'm bleeding

What will I feel when I'll breathe my last?
I'm bleeding

How time flies
How years go by
I'm bleeding

Watch us laugh in the wind
Our fate is sealed
I'm bleeding

Everything fades to grey
I'm bleeding

Everything is so desolate
I'm bleeding

Life is but a gaping wound
I'm bleeding

I feel like the end of the world
I'm bleeding
