Our time has come
Thousands of corpses lay on the ground
This is the day of victory

We are the Black Knights
We are born to dominate
Because we are Death
We are Darkness
And we are Hate

The Empire of Light has fallen
The world belongs to us now

All is dead, all is black
The Black Knights are victorious
We are the mightiest
Our kingdom will last forever

We are the Black Knights
The Knights of Evil
And no one will defeat us
Because our kingdom will last forever

We are victorious
We, the Black Knights
From the forgotten Kingdom of Desolation we've come to reign
And now the Middle Ages are rising again
And will last forever
I am the last King
Forever
