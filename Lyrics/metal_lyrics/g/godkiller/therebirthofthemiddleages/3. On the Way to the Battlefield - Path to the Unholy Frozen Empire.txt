Here comes the darkened winter
Beyond the Styx is rising the frozen sun
From the frozen Sea of Sorrow
In the darkest sky
The grim howl of the frozen wind I hear

And on my throne of ice
With my battleaxe
I summon:
"Father!
Hear my desperate cry
The final war is coming
Victory must be mine
Grant me your power"

The sword is flourished
We can hear screams
The screams of the knights

From the forgotten Kingdom of Desolation
Comes the final reign
The grim howl of the frozen wind I hear

The Kingdom of Tragedies
Is the final and everlasting kingdom
Born but endless is my kingdom
