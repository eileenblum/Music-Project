From the castle in the fog
(The castle) with countless battles
Is sounding the horn

Only true warriors full of true hate
Are living in this castle
Raised in Pestland
Surrounded with dull clouds and frozen
winds

I summon the mournful night
And come forth the chasm in the sky
As thunder rumbles
And the fullmoon lights our doleful faces

We have no fear
We who honour our mission:
The rebirth of the Middle Ages

It will soon be time
Time for the final war
