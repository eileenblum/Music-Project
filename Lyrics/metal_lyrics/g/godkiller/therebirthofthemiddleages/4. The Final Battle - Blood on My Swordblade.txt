On the top of a misty hill
We are standing on our warhorses
With our black swords
Proud as the raven and strong and evil

The battle is storming below
Our troops are trampling the vermin
As the smell of blood reaches us
We are the Black Knights
Born to reign

Blood on my swordblade

Trumpets are sounding gloriously
The rolling of drums is announcing dominion

Blood on my swordblade

We are led by pure hatred
By a desire for holocaust
I strike and I strike 
With my bloodstained sword
We have no mercy
The extermination will be complete
