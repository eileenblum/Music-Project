Dark Forest, Mighty Force Of Nature
My Deed is done, Betrayer got 
What he deserved

Here is my place
I must live alone, with my dreams
Of Darkness and Purity

No one can understand my way of life
So, nothing but Hate remains

You said you are The True One, 
But that you were NOT.
Your body is now buried
And to Hell your soul will be send

I said to you that Traitors
Will be Punished,
So enjoy your trip to
The Realm Of The Master.

Rites of Immortality
Still echoes in My mind,
When I am remembering our Coven

Those deeds of Darkness
Were best times of My life

Now I am only waiting...
...That The Lord shall Arise
