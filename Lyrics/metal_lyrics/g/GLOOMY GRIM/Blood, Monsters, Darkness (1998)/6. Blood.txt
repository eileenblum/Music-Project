jesus christ come here
And you will be crucified again

All the churches will burn,
I have plenty of Nails

I had enough of your weakness,
Turn the other side and that stuff
Why the Hell I must show if I am weak?
I prefer Fight back and be proud.

We take you to Golgatha 
And you suffer again
This time you will leave here
Ashamed, Torn and Ripped

Piece by Piece

THIS TIME YOU DON'T COME BACK!
THIS TIME IS IT ALL OVER.
