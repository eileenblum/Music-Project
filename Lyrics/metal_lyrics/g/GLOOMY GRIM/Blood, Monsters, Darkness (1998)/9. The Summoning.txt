Unholy mandal against
The christian faith

Remember Us,
King of The Dark Ones,
Spirit of North,
Remember

Loose Thy Arrows and
The Hordes of Darkness
Lead Us, Oh Spirit of North
As We Battle against

The weakness

Let the Blood run red.

Remember Us, King of Our Homeland,
Spirit of North
Lead us

Thee I call forth to guard this
North Place of the Most,
Remember US

Lord of Magic and the Sword
Master of Wisdom and the word

Come to Us and let Us win,
We will always bow to You
