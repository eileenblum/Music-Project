I KNEW they could not keep You there
Welcome home
Now we are Stronger than EVER,
We are One

I prayed the Lords of Darkness
It did work, like always

Now it is time for Us
To Get Even
They put You to Six feet under

Nothing I despite more
Than those stones of weakness

So, We must Destroy them...
...and all what they represent.

Side by side We are walking
Until The End
Side by side We meet Our Lord,
Who reigns in...

FIRE.
WE STAND PROUD..
AND KILL...
THE WEAK!
