Shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle
Their tongues were like to a serpent
The venom of saps is under their lips
Their faces were as the faces of men
and their teeth were as sharp as lions

They gather for attack preparing for War
against to all who have turned their back
We do our prays toward to Him
and waiting for The Sign

Open the Gates of The Mighty Serpent
and loose the Mad Gods Of Chaos
We do our heads towards the sky
and listen for The Steel

To the Altar of The Holocaust
we will give our lamb
Fear the Lord and give Him honour
The Judgement Day is coming
[Repeat]

They gather for attack preparing for War
against to all who have turned their back
We do our prays toward to Him
and waiting for The Sign

Open the Gates of The Mighty Serpent
and loose the Mad Gods Of Chaos
We do our heads towards the sky
and listen for The Steel

HAIL!
The Horned One
who is leading us to our victory
BATTLE!
`til the end of your life
BLOOD!
We let The Blood run red
DEATH!
Against to you all
[Repeat]

Hell and Death were casted from The Pool Of Fire
Shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle
Their tongues were like to a serpent
The venom of saps is under their lips
Their faces were as the faces of men
and their teeth were as sharp as lions

They gather for attack preparing for War
against to all who have turned their back
We do our prays toward to Him
and waiting for The Sign

Open the Gates of The Mighty Serpent
and loose the Mad Gods Of Chaos
We do our heads towards the sky
and listen for The Steel

HAIL!
The Horned One
who is leading us to our victory
BATTLE!
`til the end of your life
BLOOD!
We let The Blood run red
DEATH!
Against to you all
[Repeat]

To the Altar of The Holocaust
we will give our lamb
Fear the Lord and give Him honour
The Judgement Day is coming
[Repeat]

Prepare for WAR!
