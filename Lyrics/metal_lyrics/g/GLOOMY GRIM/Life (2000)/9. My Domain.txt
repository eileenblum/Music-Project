Blood on the wall
reminds me of that night
When my hopes and dreams
came true and visible

He came from Darkness
To set us free

I took the sword and
started to cut
My flesh to my soul
to see beyond The Gates

When life fades away
from my body
I saw a vision
from The Other Side

We salute the flags Of The Damned
We fly the winds of River Beyond
We burn in the Fires of the Deep
We roam over this cursed land

I have seen
The Darkened Depths
of Hell

Black Magic Rites
on that Black Evil Night
begins with the slice
of The Blade

We are only living
borrowed time
from our Fate

Darkness covers the world
My Kingdom, My Domain

He came from Darkness
To set us free
I saw a vision
from The Other Side
[Repeat]

We salute the flags Of The Damned
We fly the winds of River Beyond

I have seen
The Darkened Depths
of Hell
