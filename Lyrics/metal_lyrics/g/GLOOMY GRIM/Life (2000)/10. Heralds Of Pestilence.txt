To the Wandering Ghost of Wastes
you have delivered me

To the Phantoms of the fallen ruins
you have delivered me

Armed with The Flame
Looked upon The Queen Of The Graves
opened The Eye on The Throne
The Dark waters stirred
[Repeat]

To The Deserts, The Wastes, The Forbidden Lands
you have handed me over
At The Gates, The Depths, The Unseen Lands
you have handed me over
[Repeat]

Destructive storms and winds are they
An evil blast, Herald of the Baneful Storm
An evil blast, forerunner of the Baneful Storm

To the Wandering Ghost of Wastes
you have delivered me

To the Phantoms of the fallen ruins
you have delivered me

To The Deserts, The Wastes, The Forbidden Lands
you have handed me over
At The Gates, The Depths, The Unseen Lands
you have handed me over
[Repeat twice]
