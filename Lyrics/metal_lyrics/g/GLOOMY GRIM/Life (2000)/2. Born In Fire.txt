These things said the Son of The Lord,
who has his eyes like to a flame of fire
and who will fight against them with the sword
Preparing us for Our Glory

I will kill their children with death,
all the people shall know that I am The Chosen

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth
For the first heaven and the first earth was gone
and the sea now no more exists
Hell and Death only reigns supreme

And I saw a Creature coming out from Bottomless Pit
The Old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan
He came here to lead us in our path
And the false prophets shall be tormented
day and night for ever and ever

And I who have heard and seen these things
I fell down to adore beneath the feet of the Demon

And I saw a Creature coming out from Bottomless Pit
The Old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan
He came here to lead us in our path
And the false prophets shall be tormented
day and night for ever...

And he said to me: See thou do it not,
for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets
and of them that keep the words of the prophecy of this vision
We are
Born In Fire

And I who have heard and seen these things
I fell down to adore beneath the feet of the Demon

And he said to me: See thou do it not,
for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets
and of them that keep the words of the prophecy of this vision
We are
Born In Fire

Every day I will bless You
I will praise Thy name,
for You are The King of Kings,
Lord Of The Lords
