After these things
I saw four demons standing
on the four corners of the earth

Holding the four winds
that the wind should not blow on the earth,
nor on the sea, nor on any tree

They opened The Pit Of The Beast

Their hands turn the world
Into the harmony of bizarre
Their hands touch the weak
The Sign is when blood is black

Behold a black horse
he that sat on him
had a pair of balances in his hand
our Redeemer has come

I looked down
and saw The Beast rise
up out of the sea having seven heads

I saw one of His
heads as if were wounded to death
and his deadly wound was healed

They opened The Pit Of The Beast

Their hands turn the world
Into the harmony of bizarre
Their hands touch the weak
The Sign is when blood is black

Armageddon is here
It is now
Armageddon is here
The second coming
Armageddon is here
It is now

It is now...

Behold a black horse
he that sat on him
had a pair of balances in his hand
our Redeemer has come
[Repeat]

Armageddon is here
It is now
Armageddon is here
The second coming
Armageddon is here
It is now

It is now...

Armageddon is here
It is now
Armageddon is here
The second coming
Armageddon is here
It is now
Armageddon is here
The second coming
