At The Gates I waited
but you forced me awake
The grass was withered
and the flower was fallen
Our Lord was spoken

You can?t stop me now
as I am reaching The Final End
So do me a last favour

Set me free
Let me be
Leave me alone
I want to die

Let Them come,
and tell us all
things that are to come
Hear me, all you hallowed beings

Leave me alone
I want to die

Hear, you deaf,
and you blind,
behold that you may see
I have been patient for ages,
You will listen and I am speaking now

I am, I am The Lord
and there is no saviour besides me
I am, I am The Lord
and there is no saviour besides me

At The Gates I waited
but you forced me awake
The grass was withered
and the flower was fallen
Our Lord was spoken

You can?t stop me now
as I am reaching The Final End
So do me a last favour

Set me free
Let me be
Leave me alone
I want to die

Let Them come,
and tell us all
things that are to come
Hear me, all you hallowed beings

Set me free
Let me be
Leave me alone
I want to die
