I am Alpha and Omega,
The Beginning and the End.
The Chosen One,
who is, who was, who is to come,
The Almighty

Hear, O Lord,
hear the voice of my supplication,
when I pray to thee
Come, children, hearken to me,
I will teach you the fear of The Lord

Blessed is he,
who reads and hears the words of this prophecy
and keeps those things which are written in it,
for the time is at hand

For the great Day of Their
Wrath is to come,
who shall be able to stand?

He shall rule them with a rod of iron,
as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken

For the great Day of Their
Wrath is to come,
who shall be able to stand?

He shall rule them with a rod of iron,
as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken

And behold a pale horse,
he that sits upon, his name is Death
He shall seek them,
and shall find the men that resist Thee

And Power was given to Him,
over The Four Parts Of The Earth
To kill with sword, with famine,
and with Death

And with the beasts of the earth
We?ll take over the land
Blessed be the Serpent Of The Deep,
Thy Kingdom will come

Blessed is he,
who reads and hears the words of this prophecy
and keeps those things which are written in it,
for the time is at hand

I am Alpha
I am Omega
I am Alpha
I am Omega
Alpha...
Omega...
Alpha...
Omega...
