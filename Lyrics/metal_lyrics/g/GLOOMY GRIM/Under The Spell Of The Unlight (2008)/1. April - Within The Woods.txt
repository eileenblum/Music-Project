As I felt that the fire and storm went away
from the mistress of the Stormblast
I decided to move away
and live outside this and her world.

I rented old cabin within the woods
some said that it was fool thing to do
they said
that it is haunted
by the family who lived there before
I had heard of that case
when they all were just vanished.

The family was searched by people
but they never were found
they were just disappeared
like smoke in the wind.

I also visited this house, years before
right away I felt that I belong here
who is there? I want to be alone
Leave me alone!

I am sure that there was something
Is this happening to me again
I am so scared of those things upstairs
I am going insane.

Leave me alone!
