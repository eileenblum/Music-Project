Who will understand my horrible agony
Which I am suffering all the time?
I have began to avoid people and to seek solitude.
If I tell them of what
I have witnessed they think I am insane.
If I keep my mouth shut they ask "what is wrong with you?".

This is going to be the end of my life,
At least it seems to be like it is.
I am only sitting here and scaring of those beings,
This can't be good for my health.

Who are they? What they want? Am I me?
Depression, self-mutilation, voices, leave me alone.
Why they haunt me? Is this real?
It is time to stop this madness and set myself free.

Astral plane I have travelled through,
Saw myself and maybe you.
Wandered through the mysteries of man,
Travelled through the lapse of time and eternity.

Astral plane I have travelled through,
Saw myself and maybe you.
Still scared of myself, I continue wandering,
So far that none can reach me.
