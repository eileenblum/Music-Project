At night, I suddenly woke upfor nameless, faceless terrorI sat on the edge of my bedwith my feet firmly planted on the floorI tried to breathe at a normal ratesaying the magical words. Haunting terrors of the nightbe gone and let me beÂ´til the dawn of the lightbright moon watch over me I heard something moving under my bedraised my feet, because I was so scaredI asked if thereÂ´s someone thereIt was too quiet, nothing was heard Suddenly closet openedI saw something I have never seen before
