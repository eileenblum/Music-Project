This November morning
I woke up and saw
the bird come in
It is said that it means death

Nature is coming to take its own
So, it sends messenger to the mortals
I felt that blood is running
out of my body

And the bird came in
so it was my time to leave
to the unknown places
where none has come back

I felt that it wasn't my time yet
so, I screamed out loud
"Why did you send the Messenger?"
"What have I done wrong?"

You are only out there
because we need you
we want to come out
Of this grave of ours

We are going to take you.
