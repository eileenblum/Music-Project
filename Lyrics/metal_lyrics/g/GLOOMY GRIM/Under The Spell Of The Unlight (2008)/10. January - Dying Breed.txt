It had a face like mine is, but it didn't look like me.
It talked like me, but the voice wasn't mine.
It was like watching myself from the mirror,
Which is distorted and twisted.

"You have wondered of what we are,
Even you know it already.
We are you and you are us.
Dying breed is what we are; we'll live together as one.
Dying breed is what we are, you, me and the others."

The thing disappeared and I started to wonder
Has is this all happened only in my mind,
But other people have seen them too,
So I really don't know anything anymore.
