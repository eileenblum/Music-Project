As I am now writing I am back at home
And I'll have to tell you all,
I just looked myself from the mirror
But didn't recognize myself.

My face was pale and I looked like
I was just dug up from the grave.
Mistress of the Stormblast was here,
But as I understood, I tried to burn her alive,

Matches in my hand I stood there,
She was screaming that she is on fire,
I was invoking the flames.

"Burn, burn, burn.
Now is the time for you to show your loyalty to us.
You'll have to get rid of all love and become as we are.
Burn, burn, burn! Let the flames get higher and higher.
Burn, burn, burn! Clean your way to our realm.
We are waiting for you down here.
We have been waiting since you were born, our leader,
You'll just have to take the final step
And you will reign forever

Forever, forever, forever, forever..."
