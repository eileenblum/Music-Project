The witch ran away with fear in her eyes,
She said she'll never come back.
Things went too obscure for her,
magic spells didn't help at all.

I asked one friend of mine to look after me,
but when she came I had to leave
And leave her alone in the house.
After a while she called and screamed;

"They are here, they are here and they don't let me out"

I went there to look of what's going on,
And as soon as I entered the house
I felt like someone's cold fingers on my throat
And couldn't take a breath.
This was my first contact, so now I am sure.
This is for real.
