You canÂ´t blame me for what you have doneBitch, witch and the othersI am not the one to be blamedIÂ´ll send in the birdSee you here. You came here, where I have lived for oh, so longI don't want to hurt youI am only asking that you let me sleep. I am going to be freeIÂ´ll possess your souland then I can die and seetoo long time in torment. For reasons I donÂ´t knowI must be set freeItÂ´s your time to sufferAs you become me. I am a cellar dwellersomeday you will be here tooI am a cellar dwellerSomeday you all will dwell here too.
