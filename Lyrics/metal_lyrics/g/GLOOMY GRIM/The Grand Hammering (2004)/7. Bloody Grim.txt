Want it or not
We are coming to your town
to spread the word of
gloomy bloody grim

Take no prisoners
no life spared
you won't be saved from
our holocaust

Blinded by fear
this is the day
Ears bleed blood

Gloomy Bloody Grim

Take no prisoners
no life spared
you won't be saved from
our holocaust

Bang your head
against the wall
Feel the power of Satan tonight
See the enemies falling down
one by one
we'll take them to the Ground

Blood on the stage
Murder in the crowd
Get stronger on Deaths glory

Gloomy Bloody Grim

Take no prisoners
no life spared
you won't be saved from
our holocaust

Acts of unholy
Open the Gates to the Infernal world of...

Gloomy Bloody Grim

Take no prisoners
no life spared
you won't be saved from
our holocaust

Stabbing, Slaying
Robbing, Killing
Burning, Slashing
Ripping, Squeezing

Churches burned down
Open graves left behind
Beaten up bodies
swollen eye browns

Breaking bones of the priest
is the sound I love
Tonight is the night

Brothers of blood
Children of the night
Attack as one
to obtain our victory

Taste the blood
of sacrificed goat
feel the life going through
your veins

Stabbing, Slaying
Robbing, Killing
Burning, Slashing
Ripping, Squeezing
you won't be saved from
this holocaust
