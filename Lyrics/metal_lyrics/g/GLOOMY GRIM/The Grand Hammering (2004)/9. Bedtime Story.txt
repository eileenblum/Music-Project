Listen my child, I'll tell you a story
There was a man who was crucified
Other people began to write this fairytale
Started to spread his words of wisdom

BELIEVE in my god or you will DIE
That is the mantra they are still using

BELIEVE in my god or you will DIE
It is only for the love of their god

Believe or not they still exist
They love you so much that
you have to give your life
Like their father gave away his son
In their mind you owe at least that

I am going to die for your sins
Remember to kill all who dare to deny that

Take their lands or burn them down
I am going to be Eternal
If you do as I want, you can be it too

WARFARE among the living
This is what I wanted
TOTAL DEATH to mankind
This is what I needed
PUNISHMENT for the sale of father
I don't know who he was
LAW OR DEATH with laughter
I can not live

That was the end of story
Now go to sleep
Dream of something nice
Don't be afraid
They won't get you, I promise
I will protect you from their attack
