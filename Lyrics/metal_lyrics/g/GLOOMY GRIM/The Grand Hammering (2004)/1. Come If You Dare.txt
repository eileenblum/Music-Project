The second coming of Christ hasn't come
though 2000 years has passed since he died
The conclusion is clear
You can not deny
that he died for good

Come, if you dare
Come, you son of a bitch
Come, we'll nail you again
Come, show us your strength

Bleed from the artery
As you han in there and weep
Death is always final
Like in your case

They say you were son of some god
What I have seen
will not underline that
Promised land or your second coming
Will not, ever, happen

I see people have trust in your words
what a shame
that they can't think on their own
I can see the panic in their eyes
when they'll notice, they'll die like others
Where are you then
when your lambs need you?
Stupid fuckers

They kill for your sake
but still you stay away from there
They have done all that could be done
so your coming would be easy
Fly here with your armies of angels
so I can taste their blood
What could be better,
than eat the flesh of the saint?

Come, if you dare
Come, you son of a bitch
Come, we'll nail you again
Come, show us your strength
