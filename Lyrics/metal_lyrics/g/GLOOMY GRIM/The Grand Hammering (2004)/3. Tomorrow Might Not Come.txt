Lost forever, but never forgotten
Taken too early from here
We wait for the day for our turn to come
The days are getting shorter

Brother, we don't meet again
But buy remembering you, you're here
No need for any
explanations of life or death
I know that we are going to

HELL - is where we all live
It is all what people need
Some say that there is heaven above
but who wants to go there?

Living in a lie is what some need,
so they turn their face away
I don't know why I give a shit,
it is just so stupid

DEATH - Highest Power of them all
to sacrifice your life in vain
you can turn yourself into a monk

Live your life
as never before
or die for nothing
you can't choose
Tomorrow might not come
Prepare yourself for that
Sometimes I envy those
who can be blind
and trust that they would live after death
Tomorrow might not come

Prepare yourself for that

Lost forever, but never forgotten
Taken too early from our side
We wait for the day for our turn to come
The days are getting shorter

Brother, we don't meet again
But buy memorizing you, you're here
No need for any
explanations of life or death
I know that we are going to Hell

DEATH - Highest Power of them all
LIVE YOUR LIFE as never before
or die for nothing you can't choose
Tomorrow might not come
