Rise from the depths of The Pit
to the ground
When there's no more room in Hell
the dead will walk the earth

And it shall be,
as with the people,
so with the priests;
as with the slave,
so with his master;
as with the maid,
so with her mistress;
as with the buyer,
so with the seller

Arise, shine; for our time has come,
For behold, Darkness shall cover the earth
In that day the dead shall hear
the words of a book
and out of their Gloom and Darkness
the eyes of the blind shall see.

Rise from the depths of The Pit
to the ground
When there's no more room in Hell
the dead will walk the earth
[Repeat]

For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
so are my ways higher than yours

Do not come near me, for I am set apart from you.

And it shall be,
as with the people,
so with the priests;
as with the slave,
so with his master;
as with the maid,
so with her mistress;
as with the buyer,
so with the seller

Arise, shine; for our time has come,
For behold, Darkness shall cover the earth
In that day the dead shall hear
the words of a book
and out of their Gloom and Darkness
the eyes of the blind shall see.

For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
so are my ways higher than yours...

Do not come near me, for I am set apart from you.

Rise from the depths of The Pit
to the ground
When there's no more room in Hell
the dead will walk the earth
