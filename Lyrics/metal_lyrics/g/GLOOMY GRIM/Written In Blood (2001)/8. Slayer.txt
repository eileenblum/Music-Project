I believe in Death
I believe in Diseases
I believe in Inhumanity
I believe in Injustice

I believe in Sorrow
I believe in Pain
I believe in Murder
I believe in Chaos

I believe in Slime, Stink
and every crawling Ugliness

I believe in Torture, Anger
and Hate

I believe in Me,
I believe in You

[Repeat from the start]

I make My Resurrection and My Life
Keep your theories. Keep your lies.

There is no heaven, but Hell is here
I saw it, I saw it with my own eyes

We are near The End of the world as we know it
So it should be and so it is

[Repeat 3 verses above]

I believe in Death
I believe in Diseases
I believe in Inhumanity
I believe in Injustice

I believe in Slime, Stink
and every crawling Ugliness

I believe in Torture, Anger
and Hate
