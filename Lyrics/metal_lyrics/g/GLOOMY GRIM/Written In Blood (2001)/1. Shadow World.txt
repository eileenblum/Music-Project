After my visit to the Land Of The Dead
I have seen the beauty of dying
This life in Earth isn't worth of living
compared to the joys of Purgatory

I can see the fear in your eyes
There is nothing to be afraid
One pain brings you plenty of pleasures
It is a cheap price for living eternal

Come with me, join to the Other Side
Come with me, join us in Nothingness
Come with me, to the Next Level of Life
Come with me, to the Shadow World

And behold joy and gladness,
slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
eating flesh, and drinking wine:
let us eat and drink;
for tomorrow we shall die
[Repeat]

Come with me, join to the Other Side
Come with me, join us in Nothingness

He comes with the clouds,
and every eye shall see The Beast,
they also who denied Him.
And all the tribes of the earth
shall bewail them because of The Lord

Amen.

Come with me, join to the Other Side
Come with me, join us in Nothingness

And behold joy and gladness,
slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
eating flesh, and drinking wine:
let us eat and drink;
for tomorrow we shall die
[Repeat]

Come with me, join to the Other Side
Come with me, to the Next Level of Life
Come with me, join us in Nothingness
Come with me, to the Shadow World

Come with me...to the Next Level of Life
