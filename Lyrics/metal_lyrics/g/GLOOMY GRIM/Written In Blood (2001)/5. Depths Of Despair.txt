Hear, O Earth, for the Lord hath spoken
Woe to the hypocris nation,
a people laden with calmness,
a wicked seed,
who have denied The Lord

When you stretch forth your hands,
I will turn away my eyes from you
and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear

Man hath put himself down,
man hath been debased
therefore I must say this:
forgive them not.

They have blasphemed the Unholy One,
they have gone too far
Once proud of themselves
not only copies

When you stretch forth your hands,
I will turn away my eyes from you
and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear

Man hath put himself down,
man hath been debased
therefore I must say this:
forgive them not.

Therefore said I, look away from me;
I will weep bitterly,
because of the spoiling of My people

Labour not to comfort me,
Once proud of themselves,
now only shadows of what they used...
they used to be
