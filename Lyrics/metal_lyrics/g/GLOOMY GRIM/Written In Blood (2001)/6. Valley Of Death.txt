You are taking your last breath
expection somekind of mercy from above
Pain and Anger are the only emotions you're feeling
You have served jesus right
No killing, drugs or stealing

The guy you have served
isn't here to save you
He died at the cross
2000 years ago
You stupid fucker
thought he could save you
So, where is he when you
need him?

I can tell you something
You have ruined your life
Only god in here is Satan
and He is in you
[Repeat]

You are taking your last breath
expection somekind of mercy from above
Pain and Anger are the only emotions you're feeling
You have served jesus right
No killing, drugs or stealing

He who walks through the
Shadow of the Valley of Death
......Better watch out!

Slowly you are moving
at the Gates Of Death
No lights or bearder man
You have been fooled

I can tell you something
You have ruined your life
Only god in here is Satan
and He is in you
[Repeat]

All the money you have paid
All the sacrifices you have made
All the life you have lost
They will never come back
[Repeat]

DIE!
without lived life
IN PAIN!
hope for death
REPENT!
YOUR SINS!
You have not done.
[Repeat]
