Wail, for the day of the Lord is near
as destruction from the Almighty it will come!

Behold, the day of the Lord comes,
cruel, with wrath and fierce anger

I am The Way, Truth and Salvation
I am the captain of my soul.

The stars
of the heavens
will not give
their light at all

The sun
will be dark
at its rising
if it rises to the sky

The Earth
will turn
in to total
Desolation and Destruction

SALUTE
The Beast
Who has come
To Save Us

I will punish the world
I will make men more rare than fine gold
Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
and the earth will be shaken out of its place

Wail, for the day of the Lord is near
as destruction from the Almighty it will come!

Behold, the day of the Lord comes,
cruel, with wrath and fierce anger

I am The Way, Truth and Salvation
I am the captain of my soul.

Hyenas will cry in its towers,
and jackals in the pleasant palaces
Its time is close at hand
and its days will not be prolonged

Wild beasts will lie down there,
and its houses will be full howling creatures
there ostriches will dwell,
and there satyrs will dance.

Wail, for the day of the Lord is near
as destruction from the Almighty it will come!

Behold, the day of the Lord comes,
cruel, with wrath and fierce anger

I am The Way, Truth and Salvation
I am the captain of my soul.
