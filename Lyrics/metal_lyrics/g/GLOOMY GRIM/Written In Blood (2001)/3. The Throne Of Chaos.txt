And every creature, which is in heaven
and on the Earth
under the Earth
and in the Sea
all that are in them
I heard all saying

Glory to Him
who is sitting on The Throne of Chaos
Let His Kingdom come
and shall it Reign for ever and ever
He is The Antichrist, The Darkness, light
Beauty and The Beast
Our only Saviour
in our world of emptiness

I saw that the lamb
had opened one of the Seven Seals
and I heard voice like Thunder saying it to Me

You are The King sitting in The Dark

From the smoke of The Pit
there came out locusts upon the Earth,
To destroy all living Creatures
which has ever grown to this day

And every creature, which is in heaven
and on the Earth
under the Earth
and in the Sea
all that are in them
I heard all saying
[Repeat]

From the smoke of The Pit
there came out locusts upon the Earth,
To destroy all living Creatures
which has ever grown to this day

I saw that the lamb
had opened one of the Seven Seals
and I heard voice like Thunder saying it to Me

Glory to Him
who is sitting on The Throne of Chaos
Let His Kingdom come
and shall it Reign for ever and ever
He is The Antichrist, The Darkness, light
Beauty and The Beast
Our only Saviour
in our world of emptiness
Our only Saviour...
in our world of emptiness...

And He opened The Bottomless Pit
and the smoke of The Pit arose,
as the smoke of a great furnace.

Be thou Faithful until Death and I will give thee the crown of life.
The sun and the air
were darkened with the smoke of The Pit
