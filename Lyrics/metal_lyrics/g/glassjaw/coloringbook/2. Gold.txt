Without a reason
There is nothing left to say
You pray for division
But the hope gets in the way

I must say, please don't let me down
Please don't let me down

How long I have been willing
How long before I breathe you out?

Without a reason
There is nothing left to say
Hopeless provisions
The tongue gets in the way

Still I say, please don't let me down
When the man comes, he'll pay to say
That happenstance gets in the way

How long I have been willing
How long before I breathe you out?

If the sun beats down on me
It would be a shade of halo
You've never, never, never, never...

Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down

How long I have been willing
How long before I breathe you out?
