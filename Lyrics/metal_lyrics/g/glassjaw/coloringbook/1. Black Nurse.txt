Beyond poor
Beyond ostracized
Destined to be obscured
Beyond right in your offset eyes

On dominus ground
If what I say isn't true
I do it to reason with you
Kiss and no tell
The police down at the motel

I'm aware, I see
Yet somewhere as you reach down
I'm afraid you'll want me to go without

I'm aware, I see; yes, I do
Yet somewhere as you reach down
I'm afraid you'll want me to go without
To return what I've given out

Beyond poor
Beyond ostracized
Destined to be obscured
Beyond right in your husband's eyes
Does he bow when you're around?

What I say isn't true
But I do it to reason with you
Kiss and no tell
The last man in was the first to take the vow

I'm aware, I see; yes, I do
Yet somewhere as you reach down
I'm afraid you'll want me to go without

I'm aware, I see; yes, I do
Yet somewhere as you reach down
I'm afraid you'll want me to go without
Return what I've given out
