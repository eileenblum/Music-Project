Prove. OHOHOH oh yea.
Kneelin' on my pillow God, kneelin' on my pillow..
I will see there.. I will be there..
You and me, my glowing team.
We will pasture. I will capture.
You and me, my glowing team.
23 rolls just can't be wrong.
I got a box full of nails and notes. Why can't I glow?
Prove it in a box.
How you livin' now?
Glow. It's got the best of me. I will sever...
I will be there..
You and me, my glowing team.
Hugs and kisses for my ever-glowing tiger.
I, I see the fucking manger.
On her desk she left a warning.
And I said, "Will I ever see all that's coming through for me?"
And will I ever break the mountains on the bridge?
23. Watch me. And I.. Why can't I glow?
Best of this filled with blocks.
How you livin' now?
Glow. I will see there.. I will be there..
You and me... my glowing team.
