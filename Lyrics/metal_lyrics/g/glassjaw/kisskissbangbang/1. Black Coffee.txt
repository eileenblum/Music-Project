This whore...this once...this way...
Are you going to run from here?
I'm dying to know
If she died to me
Take it back now
Are you going to run from here?
I'm dying to know
If she died to me.
She is not that strange
She says goodbye some day
My black coffee fantasy
Never seems to bother me
In my mind I'm hoping I'll betray
The sinners dance and fade away
I'll fade away.
This once.
Dying
And the blood taste was red.
Are you going to run from here?
I'm dying to know
If she died to me.
Take it back now.
Are you going to run from time
And die to me?
She is not that strange.
She says goodbye someday.
My black coffee fantasy
Never seemed to bother me
In my mind I'm hoping I'll betray
The sinners dance and fade away
I'll fade away.
Press the story of stories praised
Of love and women up above
Layer this guilt that fits like a glove
I say it before you heated and tickle
Press the story of stories
Paint with love
Women above let me wear this guilt
That fits like a glove.
I can see on my own now!
Breath in the culture
And I will take what's mine
And I will try to stay mundane...
Pretending it hurts ya
I will take what's mine
And I will try to stay mundane.
