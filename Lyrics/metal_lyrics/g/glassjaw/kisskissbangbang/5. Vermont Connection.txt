I deem perfection by the words wrote in the letter. 
No better, 
And I wish, 
And I wish it could always be better. 
Wishing it could be... I deem perfection no better, 
Trying to make me, 
Less bitter. 
I deem perfection, 
Perfection wrote in the letter. 
The words you wrote in the letter. 
Trying to make me less bitter, 
That the letter, No better, Less bitter, 
Try to make me less bitter. 
Try to make me, Less bitter. 
Next time you think of mine, will you say it's the same? 
And I wonder, 
Will you think of the lives that your counterparts stricken? 
Next time you think of mine will you say, 
Will you say it's the same? 
She means nothing. 
What would you do if I scythe myself too? 
I've got a job for you. 
Lumberjacks and logs, And lillypads and frogs. 
I broke one string now, Three more to go. 
Taken outside, 
Be guarded by you. 
How could you rape me? 
Me and Marshall, How could you rape me? 
Me and Marshall sat and watched it, 
How could you rape me? 
Yeah! 
Now what would you do if I decided to? 
I broke one string now there's three more to go. 
Before I take out and stamp on it again, y'know. 
How could you rape me? 
Me and Marshall, How could you rape me? 
Me and Marshall sat and watched it, How could you rape me? 
Next time you think of mine, will you say it's the same? 
And I wonder, 
Will you think of the lives that your counterparts stricken? 
Next time you think of mine will you say.. 
Will you say it's the same? 
Will you say it's the same? 
I don't know, I don't know. 
People say "I don't know" Everyday. 
Yeah. Prepare. Yeah. 
I won't take back no more, I don't reject what I say. 
Cause if I get what I like, 
We'll take my time away. 
Away. 
Pack your shit and leave and take my memories of her with you. (Away.) ..
And take her fucking with you.
