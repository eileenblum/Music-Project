I smell the sound of a growing gash
With pop sensibilities.
KQED
"It's a tune that equals you."
I feel
Hallelujah
I fail,
Bulemia;
I'm frail.
Salting the back of a snail.

And...
This is worship and this is tribute
Crumbling, ripping and failing.
Knowing you fit in...
And, and,
You fit in!

Feeding time,
An old friend of mine
At the leper zoo.
Que sera?
Erotic hurrah
It's cool.
Be cool, girl.

And...
Am I worshipping or am I tributing?
Crumbling, ripping and failing.
My Turkish prison is knowing I fit in.
And, and,
I fit in!

Feeding time,
An old friend of mine
At the leper zoo, yeah.
Que sera?
Erotic hurrah
With no rescue.
It's cool.
Be cool, girl.

Sailor scent.
