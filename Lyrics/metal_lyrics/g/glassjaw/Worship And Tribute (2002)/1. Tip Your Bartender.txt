Hit it once more
For our men in uniform, with a price upon their heads.
This is a war! Sober up.
But call it what you want,
The color changes up in the sun.
Not throwing stones at you anymore.
Your name's in lights and I don't wonder
Anymore. anymore...

All my X's live with hexes.
This is why I hang
Myself with jealousy upon a fencepost half mast.
Fashion: war between
The guilty and the guilty and the guilty and the guilty
And the teen.
Not throwing stones at you anymore.
Your name's in lights and I don't wonder
Anymore... anymore

Oh yeah, I would like to..
Like to Die like mice do.
I'm crying in the beer of a drunk man.
Crying.
Not throwing stones at you anymore.
Your name's in lights and I don't wonder
Anymore.

Oh yeah, I would like to..
Like to die, like fucking mice do.
I'm crying in the beer of a drunk man.
Crying....
Buy it.
Load it.
Shoot it.
