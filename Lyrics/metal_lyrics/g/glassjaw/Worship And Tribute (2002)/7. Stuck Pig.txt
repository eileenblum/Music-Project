Way down in this latrine a nailbomb,
In the city of Molotov,
In the province of gun,
In a route off the highway
In the land of two suns.

Sometimes I get pissed when
My blow goes like a quickie in the snow
But I'm sure I'll go down inside.

I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
On the seed of a bastard
Alone in the sun for sticking it in too long.
On the feet of a dragon.
Last night the wind pipe's covered in hope
I pray it'd be covered in rope

[x2]
Me, me, me.
Grief, grief, grief.
Beat the heat.

I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
On the seed of a bastard
Alone in the sun for sticking it in too long.
On the feet of a dragon.
Last night the wind pipe's covered in hope
I pray it'd be covered in rope

Way down in this latrine a nailbomb,
In the city of Molotov,
In the province of gun,
In a route off the highway
In the land of two suns.

Sometimes I get pissed when

Grunt fuck.
Grin fuck.
Push her in the snow fuck.
The dope fiend splashes gash like a nailbomb.
