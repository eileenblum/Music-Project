If it takes you
I don't want to.
If it makes you scared
In the bare, anyway.

If it makes you, I don't want to..
See your face when you feel
Not alive.

If you're lying in bed with the pride of a lion
Are you there?
If you're shrewd enough to be underlined
You are there.

A world premier.

If it makes you
If it takes you, I don't want to.
If it's the last thing you do...

Plagiarize.
And where's my Sandinista?
