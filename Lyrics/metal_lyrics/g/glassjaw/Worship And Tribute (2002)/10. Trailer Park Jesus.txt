Put the needle to the record,
And hit me with your style,
Soon enough I'll,
Learn to unload to unload my mouth.
Can you feel it's getting blacker,
The vibe up in this place
When I displaced,
What made me turn my face.

I can't wait.

I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.

It was quite a dirty habit,
When the last thing I do,
Has a swine slewn,
Down martyr avenue.
Am I driftwood or hosana?
A knee-deep in disease.
I'm the body
Laid anonymously
On the beach girl
On the beach.

I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
Killed a shark.
Atom bomb..

Denial is a river in Egypt.
Division is a reunion in the south.
Soon enough I'll learn to...
Denial is a river in Egypt
Allusive as the communion in my mouth.
Soon enough I'll learn to...

I jumped ship to a burning sow
Had a ball.
Atom bomb.
Atom bomb..

Tell the one
About the man who dug
Holes so deep
He lost sight of his word.
