Many days,
Many phases down the line.
When people whisper it makes her nervous.
It's you from the airport addressing most littlest.
In several days I just might prove worth it.

After all, After all,
Should they let you decide?

Anyway, in a way...
Walk the wire, walk the line.
When people whisper it makes her nervous.
It's you from the airport addressing most littlest.
Several days too late to unearth it.

So after all, After all,
Should they let you decide?

We are the most impassioned ugly people.
