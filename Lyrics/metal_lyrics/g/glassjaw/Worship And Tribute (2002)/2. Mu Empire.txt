Mr. Shiver I'm glad you sent a line.
Euphoria's endearing.
But it's cold,
We might as well retire.
To the drawer where all used things resign.

Mr. shiver, in the river,
You were sold.
You were told.
I do, I do.
If we make it over the mountain.

Dressed in leather, red ball and vault attire;
The most ironic place to be is easy...
Between my finger and the blade, right before I let the used resign.

Mr. shiver, in the river,
You were sold.
You were told.
I do, I do.
If we make it over the mountain.

You might lose the one you choose.
You might lose who won you times ten.
