[hidden track]

I am Caligula
Glutton of gluttons
Man over woman.
Man of all women
The whore of all man.
And I'm not ashamed to admit
It's not enough to say that I love all of you.
And I'm aroused at your lying.
We are OK
In a misguided sadist way.
We are OK.
We are OK
In a disabled veteran way.
We are OK.
She could not ever begin to imagine
The terrible engine mind.
It haunts her mind.
Family of five.
The engine mind.
I dine with wolves again.
I travel with thieves again...
And what did I teach you?
