Yeah, it's over
You can bet in mid-October,
I will still be ranting 'bout early may.
Yeah he's a winner,
He's a goddamn sinner.
While he dines I'm on the wrong side of the day.
And I said, "I don't understand why I'm fumbling after"
You're the reason I cannot forget this season
Or the letter when you first referred to it.

It's all calypso.
But it's not easy to know.
You walk around with your shoulders down frowning,
But it's not easy to know.

It's over.
You can bet when mid-October end's I'll still be ranting 'bout most early may.
Yeah, he's a winner.
He's a goddamn sinner.
While he dines I'm on the wrong side of the day.
And I said, "I don't understand why I'm fumbling after"
Yeah, you're the reason I cannot forget this season,
Or the lesson how an ape shall not kill ape.

And I said,
It's all calypso.
But it's not easy to know.
You walk around with your shoulders down frowning,
But it's not easy to know.
It's just a tango.
But it's not easy, you know.
I walk around with my horns out now,
But it's not easy to know.

I'm..
I'm going under.

You can't trust a man who's a governor
Ape can't trust man.
You can't trust a man with a gun at all.
Ape can't trust me.
You can't trust me

How can you heal?
If you don't ease back the blame.
Knowing you're right, won't you heal?
