Yes we have an audience
Amassing various
I ought to know
For I've taken pulls to this area
And yes the contest with the best monetary order
You get the daughter
And If can murder it
If you've heard it
Of you've purchased it in the showroom but that's not part of it
Or at least not part of the book
Coz I've read it and asked for the film I've seen it.
Oh and I mean it
I am the prodigal son of involuntary order
oh shit I taught her
A strange man from a strange land near Japan trots a dog of band
Who's sword ain't over zealous razor wire wrists man
And he's the bees knees and if you sneeze please oversee this slight oversight for which I'll fight
Granted tonight's the night and if you feel it well then all right now

Would I lie to you
Yeah I'd like to
Over and over
Over and over
Stand there laughing but what for?

Conceptual continuity
Driven stewardly
I'm through with thee
With focus on the parody is new to me
You're digging holes like you've forgotten how to swim
And taking orders like your my daughter
Like the night
If you like the night
I love the night
Boy what have you become?
You become undone and boy I've been there
A coward in the face of what you stood for
I'm dirty poor and still I've stood more
Coz tonight's the night and if you feel it al right now

Would I lie to you
Yeah I'd like to
Over and over
Over and over
Stand there laughing but what for?

And never eat the stomach no
Coz you never know
what's your praise pray and what's inside your astrological
And a time ago in the name of art
goes on a sphere
Lipstick on the collar of a wet man coming home
Mystery travels in pairs
I ride side car
And I love company
And where is the day break
From this date rape
Please step back as I play cake
Mysteries mystery fizzling, sizzling, shimmering, glissading, glistening, in the light
You'll get your rocks off
But you can't stop girl tonight

Would I lie to you
Yeah I'd like to
Over and over
Over and over
Stand there laughing but what for?
