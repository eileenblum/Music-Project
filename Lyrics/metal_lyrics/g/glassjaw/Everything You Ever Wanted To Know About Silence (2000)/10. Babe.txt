I exclude light and wash my hands of you.
By larger being devoured,
Leaving only me to improve.

Eyes
Don't fucking weep
Your weak eyes cry tears of the meek

You're expectant to the [Bible/bottle]
Fiending all the foes in middle
Don't you see in the mirror that you're the selfish shit
Shot glass seems to [hug/hog] your soul
There's no point to grow
You don't have time to explore
You're already broke

Weep.
Weep.
Don't fucking weep.
Your weak eyes cry tears of the week.

Catch up with the sheep.
It's a sacrilegious ceremony.
New flavor of the week.

Nothing's sacred in the faces of the
Soulless that you're made into
Soulless that you're made into
Soulless that you're made into
You're raptured by a guilty stifle down.
You're raptured by a guilty stifle down.

I wash my hands of you

...And what I'll do is mess you up and lie to you.
Look at you, you know it's true.
It's a field trip to Hollywood Babylon.
But I'm not coming.
No.
