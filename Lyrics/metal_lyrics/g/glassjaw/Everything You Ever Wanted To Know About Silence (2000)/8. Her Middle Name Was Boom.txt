She cured the plague of the holy child
And all the while
She just walked in
And boom! she said
In her room with her red fingernails
And a grip on the answers.

When it's home
And I'm broken, let's fix.
When it's home
And I'm swollen, let's kiss.
When it's home
And we're walking, she'll lead
If she's waiting, we'll leave.
I'm so gracious.

If you touch it
It's cold.
If you drop it
It breaks.
If you hold it
It shakes.
Boom! she said.

My name's I Dare.

All the while...
