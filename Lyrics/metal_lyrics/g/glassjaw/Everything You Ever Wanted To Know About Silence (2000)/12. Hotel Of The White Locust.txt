Welcome to Hollywood Girl
My dance has passed.

Welcome to Hollywood girl.
Wake the fuck up in Hollywood whore.
Combine the throbbin' in my head
With the rhythm of my fucking feet.
Say a novena for all those lost
And read the bloodstains on the sheets.
I've whored myself for less than this
And I've prayed to appear to fed.
As I knelt on my pillow God,
I clenched the fucking fists and banged my head.

Who could ever..
Who the fuck could ever..
Take the place of me? [x2]

Now I kiss up to God my fists
And I pray to keep my head
Though I like your pretty eyes better blackened
And my fists all fucking red.
Through sickness and health,
I've kissed up to God two years, I have focused..
On the cameos made by the tiger in the valley of the fucking locust.

Who could ever..
Who the fuck could ever..
Take the place of me?
Who could ever..
Who the fuck could ever..
No one can the place of me?

Wipe...
Wipe off your mouth.
Get up off your knees and make me your god.
Who could ever,
Who the fuck could ever?
It's sexual debauchery you fucking cunt, you fucking whore,
You cost what you're worth.

Followed by a boy like this,
Reignited by all your visits.
As long as your mouth is shut you'll still be fucking beautiful.

Pack your shit and leave, and take my memories of her with you.
(I don't need to know)
[x10]
...And take her fucking with you
