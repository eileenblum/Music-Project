Fraudulent miracles make miracles sink ships
A rice paper princess gets two for her flinches
Fuck you

In the mists above perfection,
Rain on the parade made this crowning day the
The horns on the hood of a saint.
Fuck you

"And never the two shall meet",
Said the tiger to its greatest fan.
"The amount of love you wish to give is more than I can stand."

And now you leave me in defeat
Leave me a battered, broken man.
"The amount of love you wish to give is more than I can stand."

Now I have you where I want you
I know that you are listening
This is my chance to tell you everything
Fuck you

My chance to tell you I love you
But I've waited too long
Now the record's over
Now the record's over

Fuck you again.
