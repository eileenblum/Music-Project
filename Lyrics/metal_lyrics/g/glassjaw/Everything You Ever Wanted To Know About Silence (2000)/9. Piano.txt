Three times alone this week, I was supposed to be a rock star.
"I only beat you when I'm drunk, you're only pretty when you're crying.
We are supposed to be the ones to set the air afire.
Three times alone this week I was made into a liar.

Whether (or not) I found the gold, I never told.
Richer: I, Brilliant White.
I.

I wear shoes that move men from deserts to riches.
Show me what you got girl and scratch it because it itches.
Call me "chameleon" and and set this air afire.
Three times alone this week, I was supposed to be a liar.

Richer: I. Brilliant white.
I.

Maybe not.
Why the stare? Would I lie about that which I'm scared?
What did I say to you?
Step into a pot of gold, rejoice in fire that which soon burn cold.
What did I say to you?
Maybe not.
Why the stare?
Would I lie about that which I am scared?
What did I say to you?
Step into,
A pot of gold,
Rejoice in fire that which soon burns cold.
What did I say to you?

And I can't deny it.
The love, the throat, sincerity.
And I can't deny it..
"I've got to keep my P.M.A."

Cause I,
Learned to lie.
I tell you that I,
Don't you realize that I silence it?
It's that fuckin' hard.
