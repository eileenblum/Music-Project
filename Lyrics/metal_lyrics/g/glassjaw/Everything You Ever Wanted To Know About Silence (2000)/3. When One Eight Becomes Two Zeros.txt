I'm glad that you're near
And I'm sad when you're here
This is what it's like to be me
I'm glad that you're here
And I'm sad that you're near
This is what it's like to die alone.

This all hurts me so much
That I honestly believe
You're the one this is hard for
I've bartered tact for wit
And I've already made up
A billion stories about you.

Knee deep in static
I hear you breaking up
I'm breaking up
I guess we're breaking up
You're not the other woman
You're just another(woman)
Another hobby for a guy like me.

You've given me a heart like a gun
And I'm so shocked that I made it through
These billion days.
I didn't think I could tough it out for those days
A billion.

Knee deep in static
I hear you breaking up
I'm breaking up
I guess we're breaking up
You're not the other woman
You're just another(woman)
Another hobby for a guy like me.

So we're growing?
I'm sure
There's no other I can turn to
Theres no other I can turn to
If not you, heart
Who else can I believe???

Knee deep in static
I hear you breaking up
I'm breaking up
I guess we're breaking up
You're not the other woman
You're just another(woman)
Another hobby for a guy like me.

I hope you enjoy dying alone
