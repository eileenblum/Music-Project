You only get one taste
And for this gift we are graced.
You only get one taste
And for this gift
Wait.

Now let me go
So I can brag about the gifts that he stole.
(Thank you) For all the lonely nights.
I will carry this girl with me where I go.

Bad taste in my mouth.
You would think I'm a whore.
Bad taste in my mouth.
You would think I'm you.

You only get one taste
And for this gift we are graced.
You only get one taste
And for this gift
She's likely to go,
Or so she'll say.
We sleep as we do to keep our nights days away.
Love,
Or so she'll say.
Immature love.
You breed immature hate.

So died the virgin.
I have told you before,
You we're nothing special to him
(and that's just another thing that's nothing new for you).

You'll be born.
You before.

Embody me
With you body.
I've never seen it.
I have never.
Embody me
With your body.
I've never seen it.
Are you happy?
