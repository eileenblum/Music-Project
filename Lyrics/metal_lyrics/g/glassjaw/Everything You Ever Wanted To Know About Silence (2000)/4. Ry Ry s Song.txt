There's a woman sitting in a motel room counting minutes
And she's adding to her list of "one hour loves"
She's tired and the new will do, she'll replace the body,
His friends are good for bang-bang
An amiable hobby
She's got a secret
Just keep it and sleep with it.
And he can't believe a thing you've said
"We're going nowhere" and "fair is fair"
And he can't believe a damn thing you say
"We're going nowhere" and "fair is fair"

The way you play with lives is such a big disguise we swear that
We're not gonna' take it
The way you play with lives is such a big disguise we swear
We're not running naked

There's a man who's sitting in a motel waiting for a hooker
That he never applied for, is it even her?
And he can't believe a damn thing you say
"We're going nowhere" and "fair is fair"

The way you play with lives is such a big disguise we swear that
We're not gonna take it, no more
The way you fucked his life is such a big disguise we swear
We're not running naked.

Just when it's perfect
It's finite, he calls it
She said "it's over, it's over..so long"
Just when it's perfect
It's finite, he calls it
She said "it's over, it's over. so long"

The way you play with lives is such a big disguise we swear
That, it's over, it's over, it's over
The way you fucked his life is such a big disguise we swear
We're not running naked.

He would stay forever just to say he saw you leave
And maybe things wouldn't be this way
He would stay forever just to say he saw you on your knees

I burn the lamp, when I burn, when
I do I do everything I do for you
But he hates you, hates you
And I guess it's nothing new for you
