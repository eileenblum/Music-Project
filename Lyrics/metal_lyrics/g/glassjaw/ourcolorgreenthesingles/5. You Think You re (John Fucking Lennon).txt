Burning shut.
Work. Shut.
It's serenity for worms
And you'll bow to the son

You know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know

Shut. Steal
Touch the hands of your glowing Christ
Burning shut.

No, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't

I've got a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I've...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I've...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I'm losing my fingers I'm...

Shiftless mouth of Judas
Did you spit in his fucking face
Or ease the burden

No, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know

Shoot, cleanse off
Why just live with your fucking faith
Burning shut.

no, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know

I've got a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I've...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I've...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I'm losing my fingers I'm...

Man like wait, wait. It won't stop burning shut.
Burning shut.
Burning shut.
Burning shut.
Burning and it won't stop

And it burns, and it burns, and it burns

I've got a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my fingers I've...
I've a handle on the fiction. I'm losing my grip cause I'm losing my...
I try to handle my BI like a GI, unnerved at your door.

Burning shut.
Burning shut.
