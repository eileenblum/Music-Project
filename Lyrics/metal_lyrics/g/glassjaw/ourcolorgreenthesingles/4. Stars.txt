When i came down there was no one left
I took my lashes while I held my breath
And the bee stings
And the deaf remain unaware

And I will see you there
I will be there
I can't believe
How you've been deceived

We will bash her
I will catch her
And I can't believe
How you've been deceived

By the time I came down the epiphany was nailed across my face
so I ask 'whose terms are written on the sheets man?
The puzzled and the bruised, right?'

Kill Her Burn her

Yes. Oh this!
They say that temptation is a long cold dawn
and we just froze
and we just froze, right?

Burn her Kill her

I will see you there
I will be there
I can't believe
How you've been deceived

Don't you look good?
Divine infection, the bitter half to bad arrangement
Your fucking picture
You better visit a blacker vision
Don't hold back
You're a veteran of guilt, emaciated
Don't hold back
You have a bigger vision, right?
And that's alright

Oh yeah, it's just talk talk talk
Just to make amends with the deaf
And I asked you, if they cut so deep and bruising?

Burn burn burn burn

Yes
And this is long as it's looking both sides of the grave
You played like lovers right?
And you bear the weight, right?

Burn burn burn burn burn burn

Is this a beating? I don't want it, I don't want a beating
A beating
A beating
A beating

I will see you there
I will be there
I can't believe
How you've been deceived
