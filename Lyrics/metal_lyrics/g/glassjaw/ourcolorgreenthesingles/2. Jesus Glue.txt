It makes you mad...
With your head in a bag, dear god you look so fucking sad
Embrace the reborn
Your belligerent die amoung your rabid core
Ignorant, they will play
They will indoctrinate the fetus in your name
They're scared to death of your game
A modern divide with your leap of faith

I need to, I need to
I need to own you
To know I want you
I need to offer
You another
Jealous lover

I'm glad they'll be saved
While I sink where I stand
Their faith shall be restored
In a valley of fire in his Daddy's war
Your cries that won't make
Me hold salvation for the fetus in your name

I need to, I need to
I need to own you
To know I want you
I need to offer
You another
Jealous lover

I hope the heads of all your children are used for the pleasures of pegan gods

I need to, I need to
I need to own you
To know I want you
I need to offer
You another
Jealous lover

It makes you look bad
With your head in a bag, oh dear god you look so fucking sad

I hope the heads of all your children are used for the pleasures of pegan gods
