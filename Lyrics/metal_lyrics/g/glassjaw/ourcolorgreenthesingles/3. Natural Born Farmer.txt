You claim acceptance for the time before
And you wait for all of us to offer up to get down
She leaves impression where the vows are torn
And fixes a rich [?] of the head to the [?]

[CHORUS:]
She gets around
With vomit on the frown
She's making the rounds
With vomit on the frown
And I'm forced to fight like I'm a
Natural born farmer
She gets around
With vomit on the frown
And I...

You take direction from the girl next door
And she waits for all of us to put the fences up to keep the tension down
You pay repentance for the time before
When you wait for all of us to offer it up to get down

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
