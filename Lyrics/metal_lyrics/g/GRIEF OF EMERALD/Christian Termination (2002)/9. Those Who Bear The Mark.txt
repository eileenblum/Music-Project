Spirits in black reward me for sacrifice 
I foresaw the cross fall and shatter into a thousand pieces 
I burned the offerings 
I burned the angel's wings 
And aimed all hell's force at the saviours of men 

Harvest and erase the saints not the sinners 
and fetterthem back to the kingdom of shadows  
I am the fall from grace 
And father of bastards 
With the name of the devil carved into my face  

A underworld calls where light shines with absence 
and rapture terminates the memories of christ 
This is for godfear 
This is for those who bear 
The mark of the horns that has killed a religion.
