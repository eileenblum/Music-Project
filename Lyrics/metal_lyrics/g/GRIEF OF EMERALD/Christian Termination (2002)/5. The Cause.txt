Bleeding for men that have raped where i stand 
Forgiven the trespass of living 
And solemnly hailed for the pursuit of grace 
When the rightful reward should be pain 
The cause that is god, always one step behind 
Failure as ever a saviour 
Horned is the sentinel, welcoming us 
to what neither of us could escape 

None shall pass this end of times 
Never a day after this night 
Heroes burn as well as thieves 
as gods as love as life 

The Cause of their prayers 
Disgusted by knowing, 
that human weakness is holy 
The cause that is what we've become for resistance 
When all is forgotten and transformed into nothing
