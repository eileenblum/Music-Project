a remniscant heartbeat pounding faster 
each pulse a step closer to violent death 
say your prayers, then be taken 
not above but far below 

from the womb a bloody foetus 
as devil's soldiers or heaven's slaves 
the essence of the word forsaken 
is, alas, thy waiting fate 

there is no god or master 
that can take you away from here 

ever present fierce and frightening 
confronting us all or haunting our dreams 
my only hope is that it takes us with it 
and erases the memory of all that's redeemed 

humanitys fall is the price for creation 
developing backwards...back into black 
the chance is now to kill the enemy 
for he is what you see in the mirror's glass
