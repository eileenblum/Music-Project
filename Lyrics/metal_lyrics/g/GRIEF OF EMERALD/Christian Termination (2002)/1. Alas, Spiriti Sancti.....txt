innermost holy creator of life 
we mock your glory and put out your lights 
invert thy commandments and undo your will 
see darkness approach with death by it's side 

the first man raised a Cain 
and the rest is history 
we are not god's images 
nor christ's poor misled sheep 

babylon never fell 
sodom never fell 
Jesus took the offer, in the desert, as in hell. 

Alas, spiriti sancti.... 
thy loving kingdom fell 
may your vermin wait for nothing 
their saviour rots in hell
