We ride upon the storm of damnation 
crushing all life of God 
cleansing the earth from filth 
christians , truly the scum of the earth 

God your lies are shattered 
shredded by the claws of sin 
fire ! crest his corpse 
and burn him beyound infinity 

we ride upon the storm of damnation 
crushing all life of God 
cleansing the earth from filth 
Christians , truly the scum of the earth 

through the gates of the holy we burst  
smashing the heads of those we cursed  
burning the book of lies  
pages to ashes towards heaven fly  

armageddon is here , heaving it's ruins 
God lies flade and dismembered 
christians are burned and forgotten 
we have prevailed , the earth is cleansed 

through the gates of the holy we burst 
smashing the heads of those we cursed 
burning the book of lie 
pages to ashes towards heaven fly... 

armageddon is here , heaving it's ruins 
God lies flade and dismembered 
christians are burned and forgotten 
we have prevailed , the earth is cleansed
