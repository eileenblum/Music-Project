naked and pale are your words of salvation 
drowned in fake presence , forever 
a feeble atempt to evoke a reality 
blindfolded from life , death haunts you down 

injected by fear and created words 
the hands of God strangles you 
inhale his guidance , bow before him 
obey , serve , adapt and die 

mirror images of God 
preaching 
deformed imaginations 
accepted 

gathered throats , religiously cut 
"marionettes kneel , question not" 
stillborn sons , baptized 
with empty eyes staring towards heaven 

alike his words you?ll never be 
stigmata wounds you?ll never see 
thy precious horde will die with thee 
everlasting flames , purgatory , burn with me .....
