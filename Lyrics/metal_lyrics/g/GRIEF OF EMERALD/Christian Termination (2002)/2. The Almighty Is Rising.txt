life is ending , this chaos rules this world 
one after another and the day fades away  
here comes the warlords of hell  
mayhem , disaster and chaos prevail  
feeble holders of the crucifix  
behold our troops of 6-6-6  

eden to ashes , heaven in ruins  
and the air is filled with death  
here comes the warlords of hell 
mayhem , disaster and chaos prevail 
feeble holders of the crucifix 
behold our troops of 6-6-6 

the almighty is rising 
from the depths up to the heights 
waiting for the dark age to awake 
to spread his sharpened claws 
to cleanse this world from scum 
to crush the feeble one 
to raise the dead from their graves 
who will crush the enemy 
and reclaim that which was stolen 

sky is blazing with fire from below 
from glory into ashes 
the tempels are no more 
here comes the warlords of hell 
mayhem , disaster and chaos prevail 
feeble holders of the crusifix 
behold our troops of 6-6-6 

the almighty is rising 
from the depths up to the heights 
waiting for an dark age to awake 
to spread his sharpened claws 
to cleanse this world from scum 
to crush the feeble one 
to raise the dead from their graves 
who will crush the enemy 
and reclaim that which was stolen
