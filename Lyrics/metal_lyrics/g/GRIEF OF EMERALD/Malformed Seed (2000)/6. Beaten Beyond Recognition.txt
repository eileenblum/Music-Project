I crest your body, your pale cold skin
So beautyful, so silent, but still not free from sin.
From your head gush of blood
Mutilated face, like an image of god

You are ...

Beaten beyond recognition
Pleasure extreme
Beaten beyond rcognition
Deadly desire ...

My sinful tool ... erected
My love, still rejected
Necromantic lust, love beyond life
Necromantic lust, love by knife

You are ...

Beaten beyond recognition
Pleasure extreme
Beaten beyond recognition
Deadly desire ...

I hate you, discusting whore
Your sinful behaviour I can't stand
Lying there with your legs wide apart
With your awful eyes and a removed heart
For what I've done, I feel no guilt
I don't need you, no one needs filth

You are ...

Beaten beyond recognition
Pleasure extreme
Beaten beyond recognition
Deadly desire ...

You are ...

Beaten beyond recognition
Pleasure extreme
Beaten beyond recognition
Deadly desire ...
