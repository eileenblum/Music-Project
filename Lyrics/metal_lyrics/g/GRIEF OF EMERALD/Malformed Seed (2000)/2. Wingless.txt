Beyond the last cry has the last day come
And hell has reclaimed this world's future
Mankind will die for what I have become
And black turns the brightest light

All living has failed lying naked and torn
When wingless they try to fly from the coming storm
I raped this world to praise the antichrist
That rules in the name of master Satan

Retaliation strikes
To pay for ancient foolishness
And gather in one last caress
Together they meet death
But pain crept on alone

This is the end of all
Everything dies life has lost
All your hope and happyness vanished
the day the whore died nailed on the cross
