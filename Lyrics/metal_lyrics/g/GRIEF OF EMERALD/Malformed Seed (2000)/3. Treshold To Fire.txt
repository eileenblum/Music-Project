Come to me
Bleed for me
Spawn of dusk
Arise
A new age has been born

Theshold to fire
Warrior's desire
Subconsciuos needs
Of everlasting fire

Subterranean glory and might
Arises from the sewers
For them I bleed
Subterranean glory and might

Children of dawn awaken
Pure satanic creation
It's written in his creation
My holocoust revelations
Their evolution failed
And his limbs were nailed

Threshold to fire
Warrior's desire
Subconsciuus need
Of everlasting fire

Subterranean glory and might
Arises from the sewers
For them I bleed
Subterranean glory and might

Come to me
Bleed for me
Spawn of dusk
Arise
A new age has been born
