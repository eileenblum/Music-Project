Lepra raise thy banner
Reap defeated souls
Surround them in darkness forever
And slay with the flames of his horns

The soil which we've walked is infected
This sickness won't come to an end
And all that you've feared is upon us
Praying for satan's command

All that's been born lyes there burning
Like the plague we shall spread through the night
We, the nightspawn by Satan rewarded
To feast on the carcass of christ

Hellstorm bring us torment
Annihilate all in a clas
This shadow will kill with its presence
Leading us one day less to our last

When everything falls
Like the plague we shall spread
When nothing is all
Like the plague we shall spread
