Fear me, for what I am, for what I've done
I am satan's killing machine, I am the chosen one
The bullet runs through your head
A glorious sight to see you dead
Father Satan, your wish is fulfilled
One more filthy bitch is killed

I am the nightstalker
Pentagram warrior
I am the nightstalker
Pentagram warrior

I run my knife through the whore
Feel the long cold blade touch the floor
Vaginal mayhem, a ceremony against life
The awful pig getting fucked by my knife
I am the nightstalker, I am the choosen one
I am Satans servant, I am his loaded gun

I am the nightstalker
Pentagram warrior
I am the nightstalker
Pentagram warrior

My fingers in your eyes ... deep
Your soul now I will keep
Ripp your eyes out of your head
See you lying there all naked and dead
The greatest rush of them all
Is to know I made you fall
One more soul I have collected
And one more cunt I have rejected

Through the cold night I walk again
Soon I will find my next sinner
There is no question if, but when
My knife so cold and longing
I am the nightstalker, I am the choosen one
I am Satans servant, I am his loaded gun.
