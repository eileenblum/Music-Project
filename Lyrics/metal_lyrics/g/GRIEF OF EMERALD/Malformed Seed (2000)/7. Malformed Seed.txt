As him you'll pay for the lies of your prophecy
For spreading the malformed seed
Like the plague,
You're all like infants, curious and dumb
Imitating old mistakes
Trying to reach for higher ground
For now and always bound

Inbreed of god
The malformed seed
The malformed seed
God of inbreed

In slavery you live
And always going to stay
You always forgive
Your children we slay

Inbreed of god
The malformed seed
The malformed seed
God of inbreed

Of another kind you've been born
Like your master
Even you carry the thorn
Looking through the eyes of truth
Children like these should never be born

Let me take you to the world beyond life
Let the flames embrace your soul
let your soul be our tool
To consume our infant fools

Inbreed of god
the malformed seed
The malformed seed
God of inbreed
