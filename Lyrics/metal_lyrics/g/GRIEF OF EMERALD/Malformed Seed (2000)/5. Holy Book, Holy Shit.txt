Holy book, holy shit
Every page a lie
Holy book, holy shit
Followers will die
Saacred words of god
The greatest lie of all
Hands of hypocracy, folded in prayers
Slay them all, make them fall ...

Holy book, holy shit
Every word's a lie
Holy book, holy shit
followers will die

The flames will colour the sky red
Invokers of god will be dead
The final war has arrived
Through the new dark age we ride
Total war, apocalypse there isI raise my cup
and taste the chaos kiss

Holy book, holy shit
every word's a lie
Holy book, holy shit
Followers will die

Armageddon, war and total disaster
Plague, death, lambs looking for their master
The final war has arrived
Through the dark new age we ride
Total war, apocalypse there is
I raise my cup for the chaos kiss

Holy book, holy shit
Every word's a lie
Holy book, holy shit
Followers will die
