Like that become, when darkness is upon you 
After blessings heard in fading breaths 
And sink below summer's bereaving carpet 
To eternal perverse death 

Lightning from the newborn eyes 
the air is filled with flies 
Feasting on flesh's disgrace 
Circling as the infant's rightful crown 

Kiss the ashes, kiss the spiritless 
In praise to all the foul and hated creatures of this world 
Kiss the sky goodbye 
Light will cheer with absence for the newborn lord of flies 

Nightspawn 

Darkwinged creation  
Come forth from the shadows 
Revel your lust for vengeance 
Revel your endless hate 

With you we'll rule the earth 
Rule their dreams 
Rule to breed 
What famine feeds 
Spread our wings 
Spread disease  
Live to let 
Our pest unleash 

With you we'll rule the earth 
Reveal our might, infect the soil 
Darken the hope op salvation in sight 
We have arrived to end your lives 
Kindred cadaver dine 
So your wings mat hold out this flight 

Swarm over the glory and grace 
Covered in filth and blood 
As icons of reeking disgust solemn rewarded by god 
the horror strikes fast in their hearts and still, 
Life never last foerever 
Even angels from the sky to face us who never die 
But the gates have already been entered 
And the black in our souls 
Will forever be ... 
When the black sun once more rises 
When only darkness lives 

Nightspawn 
With you we'll rule the earth
