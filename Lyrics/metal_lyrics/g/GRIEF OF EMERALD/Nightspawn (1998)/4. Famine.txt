Desire for the rotten 
And greedy feeble flesh 
Leads to raging battles 
For one to concour death 
Of life is all forgotten 
Consuming but the dead 
In quest for rotting meat 
Starving blood is shed 

Haunting weak flesh carrior 
My life's revived by thee 
Lurking in your nightmares 
But sleep so your fangs won't grind 

Your life is my salvation 
Dread me on your own 
There's no hope, there's no escape 
You can't hide I'll hunt you down! 

...And drought defeated rain 
But none defeated pain 
So man dissension driven 
Drank the blood of long gone slain 
Cannibal state awake 
Mankind caress the stake 
Reverent paying tribute 
To the flesh....
