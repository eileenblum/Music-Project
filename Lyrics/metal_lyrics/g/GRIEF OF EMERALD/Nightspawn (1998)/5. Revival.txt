the revival of the dead, essence of doom 

In the name of Satan - we will punish god 
In the name of satan - revenge for ancient blood 

I stand bewitched by graves 
for wich I crave 
Leader of the ressurection 
Of the slaves of the tomb, wandering soon ... 

the revival of the dead, essence of doom 
My ancient knights of once slain 
To the destiny of life they are bound 

Condemned to death, born again 
Slain in the holy name 
And the earth starts trembling 
When god confronts his former fails 

The revival of the dead, the essence of doom 
My ancient knights of once slain 
Warsworn they are bound 

My ancient troops 
Inhale the might of darkness 
Inhale the magic life 
Through the mist into lightning 

Rise up ...
