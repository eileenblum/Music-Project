Creation ... 
Stearing towards fire 
But hell sent something 
That followed forever 

The shepherd of flames 
Nailed upon the the birth of men 
Cursing the pity day 
When he rocked her cradle 

And the outcome was seen such as angels 
Considered devils by heart 
And with fear, when the misfortuned serpent 
Could fool them more then their god 

Emptiness ground in his soul 
He who killed his own son to regain 
The control of that, given free will 
Devil's own virtue to bother god's vain 

Creation ... but what hell sent follows forever 

So the almighty saved his own skin with consent 
And the most unpure sin coalesced with man's will 
Building herslef, in the depths of gehenna 
the stake raised to punish virginity's guilt 

Banished, united and vicorious 
We direct our steps towards the path of the unknown ...
