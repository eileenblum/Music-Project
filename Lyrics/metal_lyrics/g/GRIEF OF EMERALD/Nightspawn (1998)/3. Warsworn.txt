Baptized in blood by the hate in my heart 
And tears wet the ground, painted black for the dawn 
Allegiance is sworn by the reverent souls 
None to obey but war... 

Tides of grievance is marking man's fate 
And die will they all, drowned in blood 
Shed in hate 
I remain incarnated, the demon of war 
When my time has come, I'll arise!!! 

Carry me twilight - usurp the warsworn 

Firestorms blaze  
Revive from your sleep 
Consume, slay and shatter the feeble lord's sheep 
Since oceans of time in the emerald sky 
Since first life of mortals, honour finally die
