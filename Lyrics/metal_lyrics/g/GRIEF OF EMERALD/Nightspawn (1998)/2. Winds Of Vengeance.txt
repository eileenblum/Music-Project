What cross the thresholds to other worlds... 
Armies gathering  
For the war of their future, 
Destiny 
With the dream of the storm's salvation 
Brought by the winds of vengeance ... hail! 

Out from the bonfire ashes 
The witchery's rebirth 
Creating their destruction 
As war brings repent 
This is the way to hell 
Spawn of storm's descent 

Mighty storms of damnation 
Demonical wrath  
Hallowed be thy name 

Litany of storming damnation 
Slay what may be in our way 
Forever in warfare .. hail 
The winds of vengeance 
It is you it has condemned 
Take its punishment 
Welcome death or hail 
The winds of vengeance 
Vanquish the armies of god 
Widespread the holy blood 
Run wit hthe winds, cloven hoof born and hail 
The winds of vengeance 

Mighty storms of damnation 
Demonical wrath  
Hallowed be thy name
