Human cross bleed thy scum
I revoke your god
Bleed on the fields of the condemned
Human scum burn at the stake
I stigmatise your aches
Burn on the fields of the condemned

Shrines into flames, altars into ashes
The rise of fire complete
Sewers within slaves, filled with slime
The rise of filth complete
Litany filled throats sliced, decapitated
The rise of dogma complete

I slew your god
Poison chalice of pestilence
I dine his remains i dine his soul

Thy doom in the wind of fever
Reborn with the birthmark of chaos
Thy ashes in the wind of plague
Reborn with the birthmark of mayhem

Meinal crawling, reborn into servitude
Within the vortex of holocaust
Bleeding beneath blackened soil
Godless your not
My dogma embracing
Crowning is for kings
Blast is for gods
I am the holocaust
