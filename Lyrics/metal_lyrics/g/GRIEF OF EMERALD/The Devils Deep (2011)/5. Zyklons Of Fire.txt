Zyklons across the earth
Crushing consuming it all
Cleans the souls of the promised one
Bring kaos to dark one

Shattered torn down ripped apart
Zyklon makes kaos makes art
Fire walk the earth
Cleans the dirt
Zyklons of fire walk with us

Father where are you now
The songs of doom have arrived
Angels weep, dies in the deep
Zyklons of salvation, the new breed

God of fire god of sin
Come forth and bless us with your winds
A new breed a new mankind
A free world cleansed from filth
