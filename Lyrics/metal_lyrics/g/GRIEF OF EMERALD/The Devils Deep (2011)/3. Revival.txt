The revival of the dead, essence of doom

In the name of satan â we will punish god
In the name of satan â revenge for ancient blood

I stand bewitched by graves
For wich i crave
Leader of the resurrection
Of the slaves of the tomb, wandering soon...

The revival of the dead, essence of doom
My ancient knights of once slain
To the destiny of life they are bound

Condemned to death, born again
Slain in the holy name
And the earth starts trembling
When god confronts his former fails

The revival of the dead, essence of doom
My ancient knights of once slain
To the destiny of life they are bound

My ancient troops
Inhale the might of darkness
Inhale the magic life
Through the mist into lightning

Rise up...
