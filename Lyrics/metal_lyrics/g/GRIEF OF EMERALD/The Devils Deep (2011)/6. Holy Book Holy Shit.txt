Holy book, holy shit, every page a lie
Holy book, holy shit, followers will die

Sacred words of god
The greatest lie of all
Hands of hypocrisy, folded in prayers
Slay them all, make them fall...

Holy book, holy shit, every page a lie
Holy book, holy shit, followers will die

The flames will colour the sky red
Invokers of god will be dead
The final war has arrived
Through the new dark age we ride
Total war, apocalypse there is
I raise my cup and taste the chaos kiss

Holy book, holy shit, every page a lie
Holy book, holy shit, followers will die

Armageddon, war and total disaster
Plague, death, lambs looking for their master
The final war has arrived
Through the new dark age we ride
Total war, apocalypse there is
I raise my cup and taste the chaos kiss

Holy book, holy shit, every page a lie
Holy book, holy shit, followers will die
