Ancient one, makes the sky turn red
A reaper, swallows your heart
A mighty creature a mighty wind
Divine dragon we fly with thee

Beast of black awake from your slumber
Come forth unholy one
Winds will be cut by your wings
And your eyes will be feared again

Divine, purify the world with fire
Divine let the light devour
Divine, you will fly again
Divine dragon

Beast, slept for centuries, a warrior
Summon the legion and mark us with your flame
Spell the world with your kiss

Divine, purify the world with fire
Divine let the light devour
Divine, you will fly again
Divine dragon
