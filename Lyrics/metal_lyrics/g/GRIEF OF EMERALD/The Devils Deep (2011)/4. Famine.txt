Desire for the rotten
And greedy feeble flesh
Leads to raging battles
For one to conquer death
Of life is all forgotten
Consuming but the dead
In quest for rotting meat
Starving blood is shed

Haunting weak flesh carrier
My life's revived by thee
Lurking in your nightmares
But sleep so your fangs won't grind
Your life is my salvation
Dread me on your own
There's no hope, there's no escape
You can't hide i'll hunt you down!

...And drought defeated rain
But none defeated pain
So man dissension driven
Drank the blood of long gone slain
Cannibal state awake
Mankind caress the stake
Reverent paying tribute to the flesh....
