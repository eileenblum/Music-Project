Can't you see the end is near
Isn't this what we all feared
A new dawn will rise with blood and despair
This is the final war
Is it the final call?
So let the mayhem begin
A war no one can win
Look ahead there closing in
There's no room for despair
This is the final war
Is it the final call?
Can't you see the end is near?
Isn't this what we all feared?
A new dawn will rise with blood and despair
