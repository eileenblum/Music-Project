Pick up pieces, made by man
Glimpse from the past, you'll have the truth at hand
Swallow teeth, choke on blood
Choice is made with knife in hand
Sick, tired, fed up with lies
Deceived by life, you close your eyes
Pick up pieces, made by man
Glimpse from the past, you'll have the truth at hand
Swallow teeth, choke on blood
Choice is made with knife in hand
Sick, tired, fed up with lies
Deceived by life, you close your eyes
