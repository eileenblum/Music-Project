Alas! Did I look away? Have I missed a frame?
That portrait doesn't match, it's incorrect
Feels like I think about this every single day
So hard it chokes my spirit, I just can't explain
I hope it stays within me, all that you installed
I only wish that I could affix my soul to yours
I want to fix it, make it work,
Shield you from its impact
Mend what can not be repaired
Feels like I think about this every single day
So hard it chokes my spirit, I just can't explain
I hope it stays within me, all that you installed
I only wish that I could affix my soul to yours
