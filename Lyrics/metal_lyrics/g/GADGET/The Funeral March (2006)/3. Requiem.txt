The shadows have grown longer
Time is up, realize;
These are the final days
A final breath, a final sigh
We are deprived, in riches
Denied in spirit
Stolen by complexity
Denied the minor
Rectified!
It's all around me, every day; the decay
I can see the fire
I can feel the flames
In every circuit I find
I feel I'm loosing pace
So amplify my senses
Feed me your virus; do it now!
Is there another level?
Is there another drive?
It's all around me, every day; the decay
It's all around me, every day; the decay
