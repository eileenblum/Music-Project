Rise! The alarm is on
Fire up your engines
A swarm is approaching
The sound of locusts in the air
Fire meet fire
A short burst of shells
Exhale your flames
Into the sky
Descend on swift wings
Into the inferno
Our sky is black in the horizon
Another raid
The day of the vulture
Is not our day of defeat
Fire meet fire
A short burst of shells
Exhale your flames
Into the sky
Descend on swift wings
Into the inferno
Rise! The alarm is on
Fire up your engines
Another swarm is approaching
There's not a second to lose
