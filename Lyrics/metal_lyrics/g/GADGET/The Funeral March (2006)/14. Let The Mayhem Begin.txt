Another year
Does my heart desire?
I'm out of place
I live in fear
Will you wait for me?
I'm out of pace...
Run! Hide! Time is up...
Run! Hide! Death is near...
All this regret
My worst fear; erosion
To become less
I feel apart
This motion, this venture and still in vain
Run! Hide! Time is up...
Run! Hide! Death is near...
