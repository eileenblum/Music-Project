No need to hesitate
No one's here to save you from the end
Just ignore the facts
The piles of shit - all that remains
Walk into the light
Save yourself since no one ever did
Death - coming due
To fix your wounds and comfort you
The final decision
To accept your life's recission
No need to hesitate
It's just here to save you from the end
Walk into the light
Save yourself since no one ever did
Death - coming through
The final light that comforts you
Forward
Onward
Homewards
