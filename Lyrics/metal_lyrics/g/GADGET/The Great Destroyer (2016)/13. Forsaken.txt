Born into a life 
Deep in the abyss 
Trampled upon 
Never to rise again 
Reduced and abused 
A bottomless hole 
Wretched and soiled 
Standing alone 
Forsaken 
Abandoned all hope 
The rest of your life 
In everlasting misery 
Reduced and abused 
A bottomless hole 
Wretched and soiled 
Standing alone Forsaken 
Minutes turns to hours 
Hours turns to days 
Rejected, neglected 
Forever more molested
