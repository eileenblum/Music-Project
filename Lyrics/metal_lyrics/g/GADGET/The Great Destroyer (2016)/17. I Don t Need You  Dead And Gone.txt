Hidden behind an image 
A life as a sorry excuse 
A withered facade... 
Yet still in denial 
No soul in the edges of your eyes 
Blank - Hollow - Corrupt 
No compassion 
All bonds severed 
Visceral genocide 
One way communication 
No soul 
The worst of all hypocrites 
Everyone else is to blame
