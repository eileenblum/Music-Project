This cracked skull takes all the beating 
These broken arms takes every fall 
With the fragments beneath us 
Cleanses the curse, puts to rest 
Saves what is left and wades 
Through this sea of heavy dust 
This clouded mind 
Benumbed, reduced to nothing 
Please salvage this wreckage 
This cracked skull takes all the beating 
And these broken arms takes every fall 
A sewn shut embrace can never let go 
Forever sworn 
Through life 
Through death
