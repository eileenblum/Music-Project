Dark beliefs breeds the human plague 
Foul convictions feeds a rising rage 
A gathering of leeches draining fuel from the ground 
Swarms of locust cover light from the sun 
Through god hatred was found 
Through hate endless wars were won 
Through suffering, through pain 
Marching on, driving the masses insane 
In the name of suffering
