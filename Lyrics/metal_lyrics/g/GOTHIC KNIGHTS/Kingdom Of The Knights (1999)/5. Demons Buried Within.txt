The anger that that I feel forever
To go out to kill all that that I know
I feel the demons buried inside
Demons buried inside

People don't understand me
Why things bother me so much
I feel the horror killing me
To extinguish the beast inside of me

Life is hard and unholy
To toil the world in pain
This searing anger wrecking up my mind
Hatred, anger there's no difference to the monster
I have no place to run, nowhere to hide

I cannot relate my innocence
So lost so hurt from birth
I wish to find a way to set me free
To extinguish the beast inside of me

Life, death, love, hate, learn
No difference in the end we all will burn
The fear which blinds my vision
I know will never return

The anger that I feel forever
To go out to kill all that I know
