Soaring through the darkness
I ride on the wings of evil
I see the world below me
My magic is growing stronger within me

I bring forth the power of the ring
Red diamonds burn unholy
My soul tears into the sky
I wear the ring of souls

I raise my fists with glory
To show the world my fury
My spirit is lifted
To the souls of the ancients

I bring forth the power of the ring
Red diamonds burn unholy
The heavens open up around me
Dark magic now unfolds

Summoning the spirits from the dark world
Crossing the bridges of time
Creatures from the netherworlds
Under my command for all to see

The ring has mighty power
Its radiance consumes me
Bringing the heavens together
Lost souls run free forever

I bring forth the power of the ring
Red diamonds burn unholy
My soul tears into the sky
I wear the ring of souls
