The starlit sky
Was blackened by the light of the moon
An ancient time
When creatures roamed the dark hours

Dragons ruled the skies
Serpents filled the seas
Witches and warlocks
Planted evil seeds

He is trapped behind the gates of eternity
Falling through dimensions that no one can plainly see
Though he cannot die, he will surely fight
The keeper of the gate of eternity

His name is Merlin
Wizard, Magician
He is the keeper of what's behind the gate

Keeper of the Gate
Keeper of the Gate

He will keep the world safe, crushing satan's head
Fight unholy angels that rage from the sky
Though he has the power to destroy the beast
The gate will soon be opened and he will be released

Only he knows the secret combination
Alignment of the stars
Only he knows the magic incantation
To release the unholy one
