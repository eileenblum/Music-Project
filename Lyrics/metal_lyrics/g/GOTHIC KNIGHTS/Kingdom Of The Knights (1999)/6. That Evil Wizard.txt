That evil wizard, his crystal ball
His kingdom in the sky, will it ever fall
His power growing, knowledge divine
On his dragon, he rules the sky

Eyes of fire burning red, magic gestures beckon death
Spell of madness inflicting pain, on the people insanity reigns
Everlasting doom and pain, falling from dark skies of rain
All the people bow their heads, in fear they know he's sending death

They all look into the sky and see his evil gazing eyes
Glaring down and piercing them, peering through their darkest sins
In the day his image fills the sky, then he plays tormenting souls at night
All will run but can never hide, on their knees they all beg to die

He looks down at all the people that live upon the ground
They are searching for a weapon that will never be found
They are wishing to destroy him, break free from his spell
He glares down at them in laughter, he knows they never will

The people pray to their gods, stop that evil wizard's reign
His power carries on
Send us one to conquer him, end our anguish and pain

That evil wizard, his crystal ball
His kingdom in the sky, it will never fall
His is all knowing, power divine
He is eternal, he'll never die

Little people are on the run, seeking refuge from that evil one
From his madness and casting spells, there's no escaping their living hell
They all beg and plead the same, but their prayers are all in vain
That evil wizard knows what's next, on the people eternal death

All will die!
Terror in the night!
All must die!
In this losing fight!
