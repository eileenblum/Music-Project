Still awake I turn to face the window, what do I now see
Is it just a mist, a cloud, a darting figure
I close my eyes to sleep
Yet something is so wrong, the air is choking the life out from me
The world has now made a cruel left turn, nightmare calling me

He who has seen him, fear him
The blade he carries will surely strike this is not haunted imagination
I am awake, staring at the light
Soul stealer, has come this night

Cloaked figure slowly creeps before me, a ghost with eyes blood red
Points his finger curls for me to follow, a tunnel to Heaven or Hell
The blade glistens ready to tear flesh, I can hear the bell ringing
Smiles and screams fall on deaf ears, terror surrounds my soul

No dancing with the Devil, no climbing a staircase to the clouds
This is not haunted imagination, I am awake staring at the light

No don't take me away, I will fight not follow, not fall to your blade
Please God don't let him take me away, today is not the day
I want to live my life complete

The reaper misses now a change opens up I turn and hit the ground
Sink my fingers deep into the Earth and start to breath aloud
With a crooked smile he says "there's been a change of plans today"
Lights and figures form, machines surround me
Things have turned my way

No dancing with the Devil, no climbing a staircase to the clouds
This is not haunted imagination, I am awake staring at the light
