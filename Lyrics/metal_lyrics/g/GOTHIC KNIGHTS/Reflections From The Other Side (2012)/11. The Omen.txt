Comets falling from heaven, Vatican hand trembles in write
Archens cry from the mountain top, keys in the grip of angel five
The darkest evil, this way comes, prepare for the night

Infernal storm, straight from the east
Wails from the pit, awaiting the feast
Born not of the hand, but out from the fang
The cross will cleave way for this predator of man

Damien, Damien, Damien, portaci a casa
Damien, child unholy
Damien, fire!

Fighting for souls as above so below, witness the birth child
Wolves of the black commissioned by fate
Shielding the son of the wild
Out of the sea, the Hoar will rise and darken the skies

Riding the storm, sent by the beast
Souls of the saints, serve the demonic feast
Cursed is man, this spawn of the fang
Unleashing the wrath of the evil omen

Damien, portaci a casa
Damien, Damien, Damien
Damien, child unholy
Damien, Damien, Damien, fire

Uovo del Demonio
Innalzati vai avanti principe
Afferma il tuo regno
Stabilisci il tuo dominio sull' uomo
Uovo del Demonio

Born past midnight, to a mother, a jackal
Priest slays the son of another
Makes the switch and now begins the omen
I have returned to claim my rightful throne
A child of the night, I've come back to rule the light
For those who kneel before me and pray
For those in my way, now fear me
Damien, child of the light
Damien, evil hidden from sight
Damien, spawn of the father who fell
Damien, fire in his eyes
