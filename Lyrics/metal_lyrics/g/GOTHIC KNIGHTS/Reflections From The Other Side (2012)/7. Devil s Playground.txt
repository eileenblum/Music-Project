I see the red horizon, as night closes in
The ground shakes as the sirens of war begin
A true hell on Earth unfolds right before my eyes
Round and round and round on this carousel of lies
He holds the masses in his hands
Not a care for who lives or dies, these are his lands

Welcome to the Devil's playground
In this underground, a new king has been crowned
All bow before the angel of doom

This ground called Hell, only full of death and sorrow
The rules of war simply no longer followed
Plague of wicked hatred ran strong through their veins
The curse of humanity has now left its stain

We'll never end the war, we'll never learn in time

Forever bound locked in chains, prison of pain
Families torn but the memories remain, life fades away
The will of men lost inf lames, lead astray
Children of the world victims of our rage
See the blood red skies, oh how the madness truly reigns

Welcome to the Devil's playground
in this underworld, a new king has been crowned
All bow before the angel of doom
And it's the Devil's playground
