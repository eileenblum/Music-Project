Always faked around your symptoms
What, can't you get out of bed
Don't complain again to me you loser
Your words mean shit to me
I got sick and tired of your bullshit
But now I'm on the mend
Why don't you work you silly bastard
Get up, walk out that door

You aren't a victim of the system
Join us now, you maggot
One last chance you say
To hell with you and your ways
I will turn not to stare
The path for me looks better
Well, it got worse for you
Now sit and rot in jail

Now you pay the price
It's all caught up to you

A curtain call is all you'll ever be

Your obsession
It hurt an innocent mind
A sick joke of your religion
You just cackled and smiled
Your life hangs by a thread
Can you hear the violin
You just twist the truth
We judge what we see

Your face will crack a mirror
From memories of your crime
Your future is so pathetic
Justice served in style
If you pause to think now
you'll see you'll never win
Don't kid yourself
And forget to read
The writing on the wall
