For many years I traveled, distant oceans and far away lands
Lost cities I have wandered, time slipping through my hands
Within these eyes, my past disguised
Always set free, lived a thousand lives

Through the ages of our being, machine to carry me wherever I decide
Explore the human mystery, found the answers lsot in antiquity
Drifting through shadows of time
Immortal, no hope to cross to the other side
My prison this promised land

Once a prince, I have conquered, kingdoms now eroded in sand
Climbed through a magic portal, cursed by the pharaoh's hand
Now just a dream, no one but me
Alone to be, till the end of time

A ghost, a shadow, a demigod
A prisoner, a traveler of space and time

Oh pharaoh, pharaoh, new world in time

The light of the heavens surrounds me, forces carry me higher
Spirits point to me, follow the sign,forces carry me higher

To the vortex, the swirling light, curse of eternal light
Cannot escape the peril, to the gate of a new world in time
Oh pharaoh, pharaoh, new world in time
A shadow, a nomad, a man
Cursed immortal
A new world time
