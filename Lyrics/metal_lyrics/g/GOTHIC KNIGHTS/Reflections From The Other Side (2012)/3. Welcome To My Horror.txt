Silhouette in the shadows, like a long lost fairy tale
Masked demon living inside, master of the grand design
Walk through the Garden of Eden, faint storm clouds high above
Leading you, dance into my world, trapped forever in this maze

Inner soul lost in this maze
Mother calling, ever stalking, but now I turn to you

Voices calling, ever haunting
They are always there
Guiding me, driving me
Fulfill my endless crave

Oh how I wish and prey upon a star
To taste your love, your life, your blood
A trick I play tonight to charm your heart
A smile turns to terror, always hidden in my eyes

Fascination pure temptation I will carve my name
Twist the blade, sooth my pain, cannot escape this craze
Hypnotized my dear, the things that I can do
Never to escape the ecstasy of the pain

Oh how I wish and prey upon a star tonight
To taste your love, your life, your blood
A trick I play tonight to charm your heart
A smile turns to terror, always hidden in my eyes

The horror behind these eyes
It's an act of kindness not senseless rage
Do not resist, do not dismay
For now I etch, you will share my pain
