One day, I view the horizon
For an answer to come my way
Screaming with my mind's eye
Demons are wrecking my brain

Falling, spirit in hand
Just spiraled out of control
Falling, soaring
Lost in space, yet I know this face

Jumped in the fire
Burned by desire
Now a ghost from a past
A face, just an illusion
Yet she keeps calling out my name

Zero hour
The time has come
Sweet music
The damage is done

My life has gone through changes
Released from the shackles of my mind
Indecision, lost in confusion
I just needed to escape

When I crashed and opened my eyes
Found a rainbow down below
Falling, soaring
Just crawled out from this nameless grave
