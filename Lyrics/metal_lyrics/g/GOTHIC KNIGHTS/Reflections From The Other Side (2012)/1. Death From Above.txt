I flee this maze of horror
Creeped out from this razor cage
I spread my wings of fury
Unleash my inner rage

Soaring high metallic raptor
They could not dominate

Laser beam cuts right before me
red eye flash alert and warning
Escape galactic master keepers
Parasitic in their ways

lightning flash electrode fury
Hypermorphic state

Supersonic beast of fire
Screaming engine ever higher
Claws of steel tear into the night

Rising from the ashes
Armor blue, white lightning
Reaching heights, now soaring
Through the astral plane

Building up to energize me
Entropy, chaotic state
Thermo nuclear disorder
Molten metal at the core

Soaring high metallic raptor
They could not dominate
