The earth is barren sky is burning up with crimson red
Heavens angels cry for glory swinging swords of pain
Soaring voices rip the silence angelic bolting rage
The end is near it's oh so clear the evil one will pay

Eternal one will never die
He's ready to fight
Destiny calls only the strong will survive

Evil calls out to the legions of demons
The sound of war will bring out the slayers of hell

Wicked forms receive the calling bringers of despair
Mounted on bubonic steeds they begin to take the air
Eyes of fire wings of fury silver lances shine
Soaring high and flying fast the dead begins to rise

The battle cry swirling angels of fire
Toll the bells that ring from the voices of hell

Flashing lights of good and evil victory will cost
The pounding of the iron anvil bringing down the cross
Legions of the doomsday sire crying tongues of pain
The war is done lord of the son forever we will reign

Eternal one the champion will never die
Ready to fight
Destiny calls only the strong will survive
A war in the sky
