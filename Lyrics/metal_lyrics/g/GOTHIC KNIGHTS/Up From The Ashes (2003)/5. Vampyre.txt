I lurk in the shadows
Moonlight touching the ground
I creep in the bushes
Await for you my love

My pale skin feels so cold
I need your warmth beside me
I feel your beating heart
You're swept into my arms

Oh how I love this night
And the many nights to come
For a thousand lifetimes
I'll make you my own

I am immortal, the living legend
One thousand years gone, the fallen angel
I am immortal, the living legend
One thousand years gone, hell's incarnation

See your fate in my eyes
Falling prey to my stare
Swept away by an ancient trance
My bite left you unaware
I am the master of slaves
Whom I own for eternity
I hear your beating heart
Let's walk together in the dark

Come dance with me for the rest of eternity

Come dance with me my love
Dance with me
