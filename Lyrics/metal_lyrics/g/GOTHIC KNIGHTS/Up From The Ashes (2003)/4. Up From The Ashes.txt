Out of the darkness comes a new hope
Shining bright like the sun
You can feel when the force is flowing
Through your veins so strong
Held up high burns the torch of the faith
Like the phoenix from ashes I rise
Crashed to the ground and still alive

All the way up from the ashes
I feel my spirit come to life again
Far beyond the clouds up in the sky
Comrades to the end of time

Death tried to claim me, I've risen again
The sword drawn from the stone
Sole survivor the last of my line
Stronger than before
They tried to bury me deep in the past
I was left all alone to die
I'll rise and fall but never die

Comrades!

All the way up from the ashes,
My spirit's come back to life again
Far beyond the clouds up in the sky
Soaring high were eagles fly
All the way up from the ashes
Out of the dark in to the light again
Far beyond the stars up in the sky
Comrades to the, comrades to the
Comrades to the end of time
