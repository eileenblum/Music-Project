You came into my life
Filled me with joy, you made me smile
Time stood still when I was with you
Made my dreams come true

Dear Queen, like an angel from the heavens
You fell into my arms and I held you so close
From the first time I laid eyes on you
I knew my heart belonged to you

Dear Queen, you're always in my dreams
Can't you see this love was meant to be
I promised you the world, only you and I
Don't be afraid of a higher love

Now that you're gone, my heart is torn in two
Please believe, it was meant to be

Now I live with the memories
My heart cried out for you, tears fell like rain
Left with all the thoughts of what could have been
But now a sadness clings to my heart

Dear Queen,
You shot an arrow through my heart
Made this knight fall down to his knees
I looked into your eyes, please believe

Dear Queen, the angel of my dreams
Can't you see this love was meant to be
I promised you the world, only you and I

Now that you're gone, I hope you'll be alright
Deep inside, it hurt to let you go
I look to the stars thinking of the times we've shared
I just want to say, I will always love you so

Dear Queen, Dear Queen
Can't you see this love was meant to be
All my life I waited for you
Don't be afraid of a higher love

Now that you're gone, my heart is torn in two
Please believe, it was meant to be
