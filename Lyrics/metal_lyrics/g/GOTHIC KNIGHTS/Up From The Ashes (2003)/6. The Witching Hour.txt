Tell me show me what you see
Visions in your midnight dreams
Stare into your crystal ball, say you see it all
Hide away in a darkened room
Candles burning, sweet perfumes
The spirit world is for those who want
Love, greed, money, become God

Look to cards for wondrous things to come
The magic works first you must pay
Holy father send your blessing unto thee
Feed the soul with lust and greed

Take my hand, tell me what's your sign
Listen to what I say, I speak divine
Foretelling days that are about to come
End of session your time is done
Black bird of sorrow sing your song
Deep within yourself something's wrong
Still you fall prey to this psycho trap
Know the truth this magic is black

Reach out and pay the price
Wake up fool open your eyes

Tell me show me what you see
Visions in your midnight dreams
Let me tell you what I see
A treacherous lie, a snake in a tree
