Mirror, mirror tell me what you see
What has become of my life now tell me
Am I insane or have I lost my mind
Should I give in step into the crowded line
Relentless pursuit, just like the demon's eye
Giving me wings to fly

I'm on my way, fire from the stage
I am the master of my destiny
No, I'll never change
That'll be the day I go down in flames

You've opened the gate, unleashed the beast
on a world full of hate, don't you feel the warning
The formula that we all know worked so well
was taken from the tree of forbidden knowledge
Relentless pursuit, your demon eye is veiled
Escaping the beast again

When you sleep with the devil
You'll always get what you want
The price you pay will be high
Your doom will surely come
