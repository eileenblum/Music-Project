I show my strength in my belief
That we are here because of our destiny
I will die for honor, I'm sworn to protect
Allegiance to our master, I'm a warrior of faith

In my youth, I learned the art of war
Fought many battles as the years ran by
I am a warrior of faith, my mission to protect

Vengeance is my name and when I die
My soul will strike out from the grave alive
To my enemies, I'll be known as fear
I come with my friend known as steel

I'll never die forever my heart shines
I'll dance with death beyond the afterlife
I'll never die my spirit soars forever
There is no fear cause I see the light
