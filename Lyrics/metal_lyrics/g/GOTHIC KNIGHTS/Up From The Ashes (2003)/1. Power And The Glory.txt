Thundering crack we were caught by surprise, fire in the sky
A burning rain forever changed our lives
Your strike on our land was your first mistake, called us out to war
Now you've summoned the red, white and blue hurricane

Eternal fire still burning on you'll never stop the flame
in the land of the free and the home of the brave

We've got the power and the glory
We've got the power and the glory

Born from a dream our courage is real, the spirit never dies
We'll dominate your faith and now your lives
Darken your days and light up the nights, there is no place to hide
Now something wicked comes your way

The fight for supremacy still rages on, cursed legions of the sand
Now feel the weight and the might of the titan's hand
