Listen here boy to what I tell you
Come one day you will be a man
Sacrifice all your earthly passions
And gain your key to paradise

He's a liar, Heaven's fire

I was born with desire
To become something higher
How can anyone ask for more
When you feel heaven's fire from above

Growing up as I watched and listened
As they preached and made their claims
All are doomed if we don't give money
So you can use it in his name

Now I see that you are the devil
In disguise you will hide no more
My soul is out of your reach
You no longer take control of my mind anymore

I was born with desire
To be one with the fire
Lord have mercy give ear to my song
Rays of joy have pierced my soul
I was born with desire
To become something higher
How can anyone ask for more
When you feel heaven's fire from above
