[Digipak Bonus Track]

In this machine
The battle in my mind
I need to set free
This rage deep inside of me

There's a war inside my head
Can't take anymore of this pain
It's time to erase this fate
Now all I see is red
These thoughts of hate killing me dead
I'm dancing on the edge

Blind leading the blind
Until the end of time
Fight or pay the price

The truth they say will set you free
So when will life's cards fall my way
This world is running out of time
Deceptive forces everywhere
I will not surrender my mind
And fall prey to the cosmic lie

Will mankind ever open their eyes and see they are the slaves of a society
Ruled by a system that takes advantage and says we are all free

In this world of steel brothered by stone
So many bodies yet so alone
Where do we turn where can we go
When the face of deceit comes to your home
Look at the mirror what do you see
Am I a man or a machine

Now when it's all said and done
Can't you see that you have a choice
Never give up your right to live

Blind killing the blind
They'll never see the light
Fight to the end of time
