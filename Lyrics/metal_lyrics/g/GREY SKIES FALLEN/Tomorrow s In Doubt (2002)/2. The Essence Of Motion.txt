I see the leaves are changing
From a brilliant green to a multitude of colors
Autumn arrives, and they die.
The Earth, the customary place for their decay.

The same song for centuries
It's verses glide through time.

I see the snow is falling
A peaceful dream, devoid of imperfection.
Search with me and you'll see
A most beautiful sight, so pleasing to the eye

Waiting for eternity. 
Seems as though the laws of life have changed.
The old song fades into obscurity.
The words have gone away..

A day without sun can't kill me.
In time, I'll find a way to break this bind.
Eternal nighttime, no light in sight anymore
As we wait for the sun to break through and to shine.
