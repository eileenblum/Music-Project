This heart of mine, unseen for ages 
Grows black in time, and falls to the Earth 
Violent dreams tormenting me, paint a darkened scene 
Your master plan, the task at hand is to take my life away again. 

I brace myself for you, and the hell you've put me through 
I'd like to feel the air. I'd like to breathe again one final time. 
So now you're blind and can't see, a sudden sadness grips me 
These complications impede my ability to breathe. 

What have you done to me? 
I see no wound yet still I'm bleeding 
Why is this happening? 
I'd like to know why I'm not breathing anymore 
I've heard it all before and I tire of the lie. 

This heart of mine, begins its healing 
Must find a way to regain the feeling 
There's nothing you can say or do 
That will nullify the damage done by you 
I take comfort in knowing that you are gone for good 
Yet I feel your eyes watching from afar.
