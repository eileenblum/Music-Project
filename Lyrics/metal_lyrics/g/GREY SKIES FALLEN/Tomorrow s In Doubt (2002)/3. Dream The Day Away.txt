Away, away from here
Beyond the reaches of the dying sun
A final wish remains unanswered
And countless fingers cling to reason.
I'm still unsure of where I've landed
After my great fall
Through the mist I read your eyes
They can't conceal the hatred inside.

What atrocity did I commit to destroy your faith in me?
I try to dream the day away, but it doesn't help me.
Remember when we stood together
And gazed into the endless sea
Those are the days I'd like to live again.

One day you will find sadness in your life
I tried to tell you why, don't you remember?
You've wasted all this time, searching for a sign
The reason you must try to remember.

In my life, I can recall
A great rise, and even greater fall
I've seen it all.
I now see I must roll with the tide.
Think back only to realize
I am alone...always alone...to die alone.
