A silent cry visits the heavens
You crack a smile as it fades to infinity
Unheard by all, my fate secured
I fall to my knees and cover my face
With tears in my eyes I peer through my fingers
An empty call to save my soul.

The choices before me, a tempting lot indeed
I choose to grab one, you pull it away from me
Find joy in my torment, and light in my suffering 
I stare at you still, but now you're laughing.

It's burning always.
Cannot extinguish the flame.
