For too long, I lay silently contemplating
"Stay your tongue" is what I'm told
Time and time again...
I grow tired, and wait for sleep that never comes
Left to drown in muddied seas
It's been this way for ages now.

Endless nights bring heavy eyes, I know
A pounding head and a bleeding heart, I know
Too far away to run
Any dreams I may have had come screeching to a halt.

I need salvation. 
Cleanse the wound so that I may live again
Wait for tomorrow.
And hope it's brighter than it was today.

Foolish cries from a foolish man
I now realize my hopes are in vain
Once again you come to me in dreams
I cannot stop you.
Now inside...now inside, penetrating
I can clearly see that I am dead

As tears fill my eyes, I look to the sky
Raising my hand I call silence.

In visions I see what might have been
But yesterday's gone.
To hope for tomorrow and what it may bring
And leave it behind.
