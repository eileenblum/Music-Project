Memories of another time, 
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders.
Though distant, I can still hear their voices,
Begging me to avenge their pain.
Silence, a welcome sound at this moment,
I'd rather be anywhere but here.
The fragments of a life in upheaval,
Remained untouched for all who care to see.

A painful reminder of the way things used to be.
I'm drowning. It's harder now than it ever was before.

Where are you standing?
Yes I can see you, but I can't see your face 
Who are you fooling? 
You have deceived me for the last time. 

Looking to another time,
I stand alone on my own in the future.
I've struggled to forget what befell me,
The memories will always stay with me.
Tired of the endless failure,
"Suck it up and accept your fate."
You tell me, though I choose not to listen,
A stubborn fool, unwilling to be saved. 

Must endure another endless day,
I wither away. I can't be saved.
Looking past the troubles of today,
I wither away to nothingness.

I'd like to start again,
With a better plan to follow.
And trust in me, and only me,
I can trust no other.

A new day arrives, and I embrace the sunlight.
Now to sweep aside the horrors of the past
A great time to be alive, the lessons learned stay with me.
So now I test myself to see if I survive...
