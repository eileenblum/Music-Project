Fear has long become my friend
It pains me to no end
To sit and think of life
As pages turned or days gone by
I question all I cannot see
All this fear deep inside me
Must dissipate before I question even more.

When's my time?
To live beyond what's thought of me
And grab the golden ring

Far from here, lies the key to the future
I have searched long in vain, as it's buried in sand
Fall from grace, a descent from the heavens
I have seen with my own eyes, the horrors before

Those times, are dead and gone
I've left them behind I've turned away and moved on
This time, it's to the end
Regardless of what I've said again and again

It's easier said than done
Cannot assume this will turn out well
I must escape this, my living hell
Others have tried and others have failed
Their heaven fell
Damage is done but the path is clear
I see the way through the haunting fear
Challenged am I now to find a way
To break this spell

Across the line, the great divide
That separates the truth from lies
This is where I will find
Myself with renewed life

This seems to be the place for me
Until I've grabbed the one thing I can't find
And then I'll try to reassure myself that all is right
So stay down, just lay down
Until this wave has passed again
Don't you see?
Embrace the new horizon

Careful with the power
This gift I have received
I've chased it for my whole life
I found the key
Take me at my word now
I won't be satisfied
Until I've carved a new way
Until I cross the line

I've never felt this way before
Something tells me something's wrong
I won't be fooled, no not again
I'll live those words until my end
After all that I've been through
I can't believe you have been true
Prove me wrong, I fear I'm right
I won't be led astray

Won't be led astray

I can see the end so clear
Removal of this doubt and fear
It's enticing, a perfect life
Be rid of conflict be rid of strife
It's my freedom that I need
Close me out and watch me bleed
Here's a chance to, start anew
It's time to seize the day

Time to seize the day

Flying high, lost all sense of time
Broke the chains and threw them down
Another try, now I've got it right
Leave the scene without a sound

You truly wonder why I chose to leave you here
You never really tried to understand the fear

Feel I've risen from the dead
And conquered the thoughts once in my head
Now I'll try to contemplate
Where I'll head to next

Never again shall I waiver
Never again shall I fall
Once again I feel complete
Once again I am whole
