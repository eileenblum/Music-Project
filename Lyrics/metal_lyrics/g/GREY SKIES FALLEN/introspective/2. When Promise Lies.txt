I need to let it go
This pain that I've been holding onto
for the longest time and I would like to
Erase the memories and claim what I lost.

Build me up to heights before unseen
and tear me down as though I never existed
When promise lies
At least I'll know where I stand

Don't cry for me, I'll be fine
I know you'll stay beside me
The once great potential dies
Oh, when promise lies.

Hear the cries of the fallen
Always keep them with you
Don't mingle with the sullen
Or you'll be one of them
When you fail and you shall fail
It's just a matter of when not if
And then it begins again

I need to let it go
This dream that I've been holding onto
For the longest time but I have to
Stay the course and regain my soul

I won't be left to rot here in this grave
I don't believe in the predetermined
Evaluate the choices I have made
And live my life
