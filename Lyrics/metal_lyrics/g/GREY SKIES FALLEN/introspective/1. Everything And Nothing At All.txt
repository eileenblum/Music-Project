Peel back the skin
And reveal what we already know
A parasite, feeding on the helpless
With tendencies to maim and kill its host
I've seen your well-concealed dark side
I've known it for all this time
That without a plan or some purpose
You'll start to feel it on the inside

Leave it to no one
Just do it yourself
You once had it all
Yet nothing remains

So now here we are, face to face through a broken window
I see the wreckage, miles away

Cannot separate the passion from the hate I'm feeling for you
Where's the compromise, I'm tired of the lies I'm hearing from you

Betrayer...

Did you really try
To keep it deep inside
Or was the pain inviting?
Ride the changing tide
Destroyer of your life
Is this at all surprising?

This is where the body lies
Cold and bare, and devoid of life
Time to say your last goodbyes
Make it quick, don't waste my time
Ashes where the body was
Never again shall you gain my trust

Wasted...memories...i can...feel them
Burning...into...my heart...always
Silenced...for the...last time...now you're
Weakened...victim...left with...nothing.
