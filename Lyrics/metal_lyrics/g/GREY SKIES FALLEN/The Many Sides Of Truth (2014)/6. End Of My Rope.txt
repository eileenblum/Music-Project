For the life of me, I can't recall
Just when this life in me meant anything at all

I feel this isolation
Screaming, at the end of my rope
I see the degradation
Clinging, to the end of my rope 
Once again the last in line
Burning, the end of my rope
Who cares if I survive?
I felt the same way, some time before
Although this time, my feeling's pure

Life is what I make it

Come to my senses
Before it's too late
And hopefully some sanity returns

It's real, this constant danger
Nearing, the end of my rope
The fear, looking over my shoulder
Swinging, from the end of my rope
I take the blade and hack away
Slicing, at the end of my rope
And as I fall I hope to see 
Another day, and this time it's all for me

These things that I feel
Are hard to keep down inside
Try to determine the truth and the way
All of us should try
It's taking so long 
And I've got but one of these lives 
To live it so wrong
Is to throw sand in the eyes
