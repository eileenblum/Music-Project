Torn between two worlds
He stands, his mind astray
Others come offering easy ways
To lead this man away
Waiting for the sign
A flame engulfs the sky
Yet he lives and still he breathes
As all the others die

This man now stalks the land
In search of another
He must come to terms with
A life that was snatched away

Still the heavens burn
And the world is cold and dead
Seems we didn't learn
From what the ancients said
He's giving all he can
A tired, broken man
Always fighting to live
Doing what he can

Why have you left me as the only one?
Crawling, clawing, a scavenger 
Fueled by the rays of the sun

My planet, a corpse, its people just a memory
Taken aback by the loss
The complete and utter end

Left there for all time 
He quickly realized 
Words of the ancients
Showed them the way
They threw them to the side
Words of the ancients
Spoken so long ago
Ignored by them all
Words of the ancients
Still I remain, I wait for his return 
Man of fire, lord of dawn
