Meant to break the fall
Wide-open surroundings
Life has just begun
So get to where youâre dying

The endless sky
The endless sky

To waste away is one
Way to tell the story
Another part of life
Take in full surroundings

The endless sky
The endless sky

Sun peaks through
The branches of the crystal wood
Sight of the mind
Lead me toward the blind

But the darkness beyond the light
You know what awaits you there
No roads to see, a dam of despair
A fracture behind the grave

The cries I heard
Never match the story
Stand your ground
Against the grain, toward the peak

The end is near, the pieces in place
To lead you toward your crypt
No ground to run, no barriers in sight
To rid you of your pain

Now that Iâm here, my visions are clear
Upon twisting my arm, clearly the flesh decides
My thoughts to the air, like tossing a stone
This iron was forged beyond repair
