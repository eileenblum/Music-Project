Burning brightly, stand beside me
Behold the world
This incarnation, it infects them
One by one 
The plagues of old, horrors untold
Replaced by modern men
With genocide, amid their cries
The screams for life

So many before you have fallen before me
What makes you so different than they were?
Do tell me
And why should I even care?
It's your world that's beyond repair
Chances were given and messages sent
You chose to ignore them, your time is now spent

Visions of life after death I assure you are just that 
And when it comes time to destroy you 
You'll learn the reason why
I came to this place and why you all must 
Die by my hand, a cleansing of lands
Plant the seed for those to 
Come take my hand
Beside me you stand
Observe as fate unveils her 
Plan to destroy you
The ancients before knew
Yet they left you to fend for yourselves 

From my being here, you must know you've failed
To discern right from wrong,  you've killed your world
Raining down, what's left of the sky
Liquified it drips to the ground
