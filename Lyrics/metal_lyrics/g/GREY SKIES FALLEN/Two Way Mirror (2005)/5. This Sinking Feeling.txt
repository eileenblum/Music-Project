Come to me, tell me what you see
Honesty is all I need
The candles are melting, the clock ticks away
My future looks cloudy, there's no reason to stay
I'm on my way' but my hands are tied
I'll try and try some more, until I'm free
Know what to do, but the chosen few
Stand in the way, they'll never leave
Forgive me I've got places to be
Almost free, don't call on me please
I'll leave you a fortune in spent memories
Don't blame me for leaving, it's our own tragedy
I'm on my way' but my hands are tied
I'll try and try some more, until I'm free
Know what to do, but the chosen few
Stand in the way, they'll never leave
I have got this sinking feeling
Buried in the pit of my gut
I have got this sinking feeling
I can feel it up in my throat
