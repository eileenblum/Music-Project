I've got these voices in my head
Where they came from, I don't know
All they say is you don't need this
I've got these feelings in my mind
But I don't feel them all the time
And without warning they have taken over
It's dark in here
Oh, can you see
Why don't you please turn the lights on?
Thankfully it's quiet now
Voices silent, where'd they go?
I don't care as long as they're gone
What I'd like to do is try
To erase this here from my mind
If you do not care, I'll be starting over
It's dark in here
Oh, can you see
Why don't you please turn the lights on?
It's a two way mirror
It's a two way mirror
