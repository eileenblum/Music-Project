Keep in mind what I've said
For all time there in your head
Let me hear it once again
This magic ride had to end
I know the feeling
Why do I feel this way?
As the days drift away
And darkness overcomes me now
Help me break away somehow
Watch me I'm leaving
The few that you know
Have already gone away
Not the first time, or the last time
Never understand you
Why can't I block the day
That my soul was ripped away?
You brought a man to his knees
Ignored his cries and his pleas
Catch me I'm falling
I don't think I know
Quite which way to go
It will be more of the same
More of the heartache and pain
The Shadows are leaving
The few that you know
Have already gone away
Not the first time, or the last time
Never understand you
