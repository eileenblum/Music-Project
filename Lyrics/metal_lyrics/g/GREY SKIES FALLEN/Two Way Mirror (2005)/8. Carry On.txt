I see it in your eyes
Distain for all I stand for
And even in your smile
That forces me away
I need to carry on
I've lived with This too long
So when you close your eyes
I'm heading for the door
I feel like giving up
I lived for pleasing you
Those days are dead and gone now
Don't keep me from the truth
That forces me away
I need to carry on
I've lived with This too long
So when you close your eyes
I'm heading for the door
I feel like giving up
Without you I'm alive again
All of you out of my system
Now you're gone so I can fly again
I hope you feel the same way
I need to carry on
I've lived with This too long
So when you close your eyes
I'm heading for the door
I feel like giving up
