It's four o'clock again
I haven't slept in who knows when
The static from the radio breaks the silence
Looking through the windowpane
Trying to count the drops of rain
Am I going crazy?
Oh won't you tell me?
Judging from the looks of you
There is nothing more that I could do
Just tell me the reason this is happening
Voices from the past
Sing a song I haven't heard in a while
Obviously there's something wrong
I'd like to take the time to talk about it
Spit it out, don't take so long
Don't like the way you have gone about it
Look at the anger in the air
You haven't found a way to say you're sorry
Voices from the past
Sing a song I haven't heard in a while
Remember when you took my hand and said
That I know all that you know
Remember than, I looked at you and said
Well I'll go wherever you go
So how come than, I stand alone again?
This time, I fear forever
