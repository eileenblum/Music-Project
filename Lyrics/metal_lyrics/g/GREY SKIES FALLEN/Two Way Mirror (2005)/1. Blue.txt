I lost my way along the line
I have lost what was once mine
I'll make you think that all is fine
All the while, I'm dying.
Show me the way to the place
Where you and I lived in harmony
Is this the way to the place?
You say it is, but it's a fallacy.
Lay there absorb me
Stay there don't wait for me
Surround me with negativity
And wonder why I'm drowning.
Show me the way to the place
Where you and I lived in harmony
Is this the way to the place?
You say it is, but it's a fallacy.
I've been forgotten, can I cry now?
All these years I've been standing here
Such a long time, can I die now?
For deep inside I'm already gone.
Like it or not, I'm taking this road to nowhere
Don't try to stop me, I'm already halfway there
I don't give a damn about right and wrong
Come follow me into the dark beyond
