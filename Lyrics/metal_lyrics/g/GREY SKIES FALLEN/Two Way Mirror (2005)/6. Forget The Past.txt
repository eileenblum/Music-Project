I never thought it'd be the final time
That I saw you smile at me
I hope it's not.
Looking in your eyes, I see the sunrise
Will I feel better in the morning?
So the waves come crashing down
And there's violence all around
Yet still I'm sailing onward.
In time, we'll turn around and see the daylight
This time, we turn away
With blackened eyes
Looking in your eyes, I see no sunrise
I must feel better in the morning.
So the waves come crashing down
And there's violence all around
Yet still I'm sailing onward.
I'll try to change my ways if you allow me
If you can forget the past
And see beyond it
Look in the distance, and see the sunrise
I'll feel better come the morning.
