I've seen the other side of pictures,
Just like the ones I used to know
The other side brings forth an omen
Lost in your eyes, this place in time.
Like silk woven on a great machine,
Flowing down your back.
Shimmering orbs of flame,
Burning holes in mine...
Ivory, stunning to me.
Oh, won't you share with me your light?
She comes to me when I sleep,
Her outstretched hands...
They beckon me.
She visits me in my dreams.
Now blinded by your light...
Oh Athena...
