Spoken so softly, were the tones of the tongue.
Now lost in a world In which I'll never hear.
Taken from me, and drawn to the Earth,
A god left bereft, and still mourning for this...
The cacophony of life,
The remains of all who weep.
See the ashes of a child,
Spread amongst the sullen streets...
Left with the sound of nothing to hear,
But the roar of the whale's path,
And the breath of the sky.
Lost in the night, it's always the same,
With thoughts of your life that perished in the Spring...
The cacophony of life,
The remains of all who weep.
See the ashes of a child,
Spread amongst the sullen streets...
In the dark they stand in rain,
Children of a blood red sky.
Their endeavors all have failed,
Fallen on their knees, but why?
The unanswered filled with fear,
Seeking all that failed them now.
Lassitude in all their minds,
Watching all who die, why now?
