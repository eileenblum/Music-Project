Bring to me your heart divine,
Swept ashore by constant winds.
Swift and harsh, they crash against me,
I plead for closure, it is time.
Leaves silent in their decent,
A frigid branch left bare and weak.
The brutal winter approaches soon,
Leaving behind a tired man...
The sky so dark,
Reeks of your cries.
Tear out my eyes,
Now I'm blind.
Remove my tongue,
Before I taste (the bitter residue)...
Entwined in this web I lay,
It's so dark.
Devastated by your disregard,
I fall...
