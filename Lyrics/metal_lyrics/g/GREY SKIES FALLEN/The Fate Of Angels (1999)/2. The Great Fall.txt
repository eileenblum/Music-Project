...and then the sky cried "Let it rain",
I cup my hands to drink in vein.
For once grey skies cry "Let it rain",
I'm suffering endlessly...
Drift away on handspun garments,
Fly beneath the sky that crashes down.
Search the land, search the oceans,
There you'll find, you'll find your heaven...
And then the sky cried "Let it rain",
I cup my hands to drink in vein. For once grey skies cry "Let it rain",
I'm suffering endlessly...
Lay low,
What I know, what I think, what I feel it is,
Will pass in time.
Stay low,
To keep the sun from burning you.
Falling,
Back to the ground that gave you life.
Crawling,
To where I've returned from...
