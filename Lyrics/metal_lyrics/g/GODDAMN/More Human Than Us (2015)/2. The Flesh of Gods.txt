A test for consciousness,
By the most unconscious way.
Deceive my senses,
And to make me feel alive.
Follow the road to now reason.

Delivered to this universe,
To be my
My master,
I am my master.

Now I spit out all unfounded concerns
About this abstract meaning of life and fly.
Feel my body,
it is flooded by a sudden vehemence.

My actions are thoughtless.
Momentum of life.
Born between rain and fire,
The flesh of gods enthralls my mind.
Enthralls my mind.
The flesh of gods enthralls my mind.
The flesh of gods

Delivered to this fucking universe,
To be my
My master.
I am my master.
