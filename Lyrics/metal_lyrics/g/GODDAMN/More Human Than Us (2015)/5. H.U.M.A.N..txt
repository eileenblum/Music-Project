Are you beginning to see the nature of the cage you were born into?

Man is a wolf to man!

Plucked crows are flying around you.
You're burning the quills of truth,
Erasing passages of your own story.

Down the streets of your mind,
Filled with lies.
Emotional winter takes control of humanity,
Full-stop.
Full-stop, once for all.

Hidden feelings of guilt are unleashing hell upon nature.
Murders of a crown of dreams.
A promise that never keeps.

Swallow lies and truth.
Double face of envy.
Rising sun until darkness comes.
Depraved human useless to mankind for a mistaken choice.

All mankind is deadly alive.

Hidden feelings of guilt are unleashing hell upon nature.
Murders of a crown of dreams.
A promise that never keeps.

Human
