[Bonus Track]God
Rise
Silence destroy me.

I tried to forget the addicted before dawn.
My mind falls down and the abyss after me.
Don't look back.

Faithless, darkness.
It's the simple drug of life
That blind my mind and feed my madness,
In this empty spiral of hatred and self-destruction.
One day I'll die alone.

Old's ghosts are chasing me and strengthen my pain and fear.
Too late to break the chained of my soul.
My grave is prepared and poison returns to my veins.

Faithless, darkness.
It's the simple drug of life
That blind my mind and feed my madness,
In this empty spiral of hatred and self-destruction.
One day I'll die alone.

My future is in decay.
My future is in decay.

Drugs have destroyed me.
A needle ripping my veins.
Don't remember who I am.

Blind my mind and feed my madness,
In this empty spiral of hatred and self-destruction.
One day I'll die alone.
