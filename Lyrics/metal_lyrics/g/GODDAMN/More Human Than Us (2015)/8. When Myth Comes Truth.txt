Different, and confined.
In this global world joined by love and pain,
And separated by what's called hate.
Joined by love,
And separated by what's called hate.

No communication,
In a more and more connected world.
So myth has come true.

Now we've got to reach the sky and raise the impossibility of reason among us.
We've lost those values from the past.
This infernal tower seems to be all smashed.

This infernal tower seems to be all smashed.

To live with relics
From a doomed world,
Or to dream the omen
Of a world yet to be born.

Where myth comes true,
Your reality falls down,
Into an abyss of no reason.
