Is our knowledge the most powerful weapon?
Ladies and gentlemen: bread and circus.

This mental cage is the product of an obsession.
I can see how strings are being pulled.
By this unreal freedom that enslaves us.
And our world falls down now!

We are only puppets;
Our soul's colour is blackened.

The truth hurts us,
But lies are killing us.
We are buried alive.
And this brainless life is all what we can try.

How long?
Stop this world.

We are only puppets;
Our soul's colour is blackened.

How long?
Stop this world.

Stop this world.
This fucking world.
