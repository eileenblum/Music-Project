I'm just trying to solve this impossible jigsaw.

I'm getting away from this horror,
And finding peace in nothing.
The sanest hostility makes the black become white,
To justify the aberrant behaviour,
That dwells inside of us.
The supremacy of intelligence.

I never found the place I belong to in this world.
But now I know,
I never wanted to find it.

Cruelty facts are the most dramatic reality.
This is the paradoxical truth.

It's the most dramatic reality.
How can we call ourselves,
How can we call ourselves smart?

I never found the place I belong to in this world.
But now I know,
I never wanted to find it.

Paradoxically,
This fucking world,
It's a lie.
