Mother forgive us.
Crying for your heritage has been heard.
When the ordinary becomes relic,
The world's eyes are open,
Are open so blindly.
Now contemplate how this dark dawn buries its beauty forever.

The poisoned debt by excess committed,
We represent the biggest natural disaster.
If a horn's worthier than life,
We are doomed to extinction.

The shame of truth,
The honour of being destructive,
And this disdain to singularity ends up killing me.

The shame of truth,
The honour of being destructive,
All that remains is the pale reflection of a past diversity.

The eyes of innocence are closed, it's real.
What the hell are we doing?
The crying dead, the vacuum,
Are covered by hypocrisy.
And our hands are stained with blood.

Mother forgive us.
Crying for your heritage has been heard.
When the ordinary becomes relic,
The world's eyes are open,
Are open so blindly.
Now contemplate how this dark dawn buries its beauty forever.
