Dark clouds
Shroud my old memories,
Like ethereal,
Like ethereal dream.
I can't live myself anymore,
Get out!

I woke up in a deep lethargy.
I'm breaking a fine thread of my mind.

State mind,
That catches you away from my inside.
State of mind,
That a needle your hate.

Immortal feelings consume the heart of love prisoners.

I need to arise and open my eyes.
This fucking love,
It's a state of mind.

Immortal feelings consume the heart of love prisoners.

State mind,
That catches you away from my inside.
State of mind,
That a needle your hate.

We are living an eternal lie,
We are living an eternal lie of love
