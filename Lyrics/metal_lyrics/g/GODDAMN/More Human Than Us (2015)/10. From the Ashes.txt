[Bonus Track]Remember my name.
I am alive
And you will know the torture and pain!
You are trying to forget my hurt deep feelings in my soul.
But you can hide your life and I'll find you in your lie.
I'll find you in your lie.

My world was destroyed.
A bullet is smashing my heart and now I've changed.
Never be the same.
Never be the same.
From the ashes.
From the ashes.

You can see,
You can rise from the ashes.
My dreams have been broken.
It's forever.
And the phoenix flies over your heart.

Don't look back.
It's evolution.
I'll find your weak spot and pray for all gods.
Remember my name.

I'll find in your soul a way to screaming feelings louder.
Hell's gates and lies embraces your heart.
Lies embraces your heart.

Pray and smile.
This is the last time.
See me.
I turn your mind insane.
I am your nightmare.

You can see,
You can rise from the ashes.
My dreams have been broken.
It's forever.
And the phoenix flies over your heart.

You can see,
You can rise from the ashes.
My dreams have been broken.
It's forever.
