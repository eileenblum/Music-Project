Open your eyes and let me show you this wonderful place.
Are your senses activated?
Now you're prepared to open your mind and know the truth of this rotten world.

What do you feel at this moment?
Thousands of people die every day.
Are you one of them?
Poverty for some, wealth for others.

No death, no business,
So official silence.
No death, no business.
The globalization of crime makes them shine.

Lead dove,
Great noble peace,
The biggest terrorism's budget.
Superlative collateral damage,
Behind democratic mask.

No death, no business,
So official silence.
No death, no business.
The globalization of crime makes them shine.

Open your eyes to see the crime.
They shouldn't shine.
When will we draw the line?
