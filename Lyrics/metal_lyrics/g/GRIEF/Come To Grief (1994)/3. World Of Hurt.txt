Take me away from
All this shit I'm seeing
It's time to make a change
This life is ruining me
I've got to get away
I've got to get the fuck out
Out of this dreary place
Out of this wasted life
I want more out of life
Than sadness and pain
I search for happiness
But it's never obtained

Where do I belong?
Where do I fit in?
I have to escape
From this misery within
