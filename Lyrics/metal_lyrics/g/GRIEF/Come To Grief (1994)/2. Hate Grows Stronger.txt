My rage burns deep inside me
My will to hate is strong
I can't keep control my anger
It is tearing up my mind

I'm pissed off at the world
For reasons I don't know why
I put the blame on you
Your existence I despise

I can't relate with your world
And I don't want to try
To me you're all so fucked
I choose to stay away

I'm pissed off at the world
For reasons I don't know why
I put the blame on you
Your existence I despise

Hate grows stronger
Hate grows stronger
