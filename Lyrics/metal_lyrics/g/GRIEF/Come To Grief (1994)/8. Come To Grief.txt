Encounter many problems in life
Dealing with a constant strife
Confidence nowhere to be found
Ability run into the ground

My future looks extremely bleak
An immediate exit I seek
Ready to take my chances with fate
Carve my name in a block of slate

Razor blades are everywhere
They'll help me through my despair
Horizontal slashes-the wrist
Bleed, purge, my final bliss

My equilibrium is way off balance
I should be placed under surveillance
As I add to these holes in the walls
Life's got me by the balls

Watch me as I come to grief
Writhing in my final release
Agony like you've never known
From this clump of dust I'm thrown

Betrayal!!!
Betrayal!!!
Deceived me
I'll screw you all in the end
