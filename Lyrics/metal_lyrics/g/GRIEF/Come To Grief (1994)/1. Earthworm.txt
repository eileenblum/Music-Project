I feel dejected
A lonely future of failure
And I'm growing
Very angry

I slither in the
Dirt and mud
Because that's where
I belong

I'm fucking miserable
And worthless
No self-esteem
And it sometimes hurts

I slither in the
Dirt and mud
Because that's where
I belong

Earthworm
Earthworm
Earthworm
I'm a lot like you

I was taught to love
But I learned to hate
Bisect me
I will regenerate
