Out of drugs, pissed off again
I think I am nearing the end
Another fucking day
Another disappointment
Scars in my flesh tell the story
- Of a broken man

Pessimistic existence
Numb myself with chemicals
Drunk and fucking angry
I'm sick of fucking screaming
How much longer can I take
Living a life without no meaning

Fucking stricken

Dreams and goals = void loneliness confusion
Trapped within a cell of negativity
Why try??? When failure is the norm
Work sucks, life sucks
I wish I was never born
