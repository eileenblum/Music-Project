No!!!
More will my friends stand for
My drunken belligerence
Girls won't put up with my
Stubborn ignorance
Things used to be simple
I wish I was still five
Now drugs and booze keep my alive

Hate, it's more than a word
A way of life
You're on your own
Nobody gives a fuck about you, or me

Loving couples, smiling children anger me
Fills me with hostility
The way you live, can't seem to find
What it's about
Arbor hospital, you never should've let me out

Hate, it's more than a word
A way of life
You're on your own
Nobody gives a fuck about you I'm ruined

You fuckers never should've let me out

I'm ruined
