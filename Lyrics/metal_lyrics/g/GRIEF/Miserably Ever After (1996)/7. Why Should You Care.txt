I don't sing about saving the trees
I don't sing about pollution in the seas
I sing about my own life's reality

Don't get me wrong - I'm not blind
These problems do exist
But I don't see how writing a song will change any of this
If you really give a shit, get off your ass and do something about it

I'm not a P.C or a veggie
So don't pass judgement before knowing me
I'm not a straight-edge or have a shaved head
I'll drink and take drugs 'til the day I'm dead

I live life for myself
Not for you or anyone else
