Did you ever have one of those days?
From the moment you woke up nothing went your way
I know that you have, everybody does
Your life isn't perfect, and it never was

Every little thing goes wrong
Frustration builds as time drags on
24 hours never felt so long
You can't wait for this day to be gone

You'll make it through you know you will
Despite all those you want to kill
Life goes on and so will you
Many more days of misfortune
