You hide behind your false face
You never show any trace of who you really are
The lowest form of life by far

I once trusted you
But I never will again

You steal from me, you don't think I see
Pretending like everything is real fucking cool
I am no fool

Low life
No life
Low life
Fuck you

What goes around will come around
And it will all come back to you
You will pay you piece of shit
For everyone you've screwed
