Deceived again
My trust is wearing thin
I don't believe
Everything you tell me

Your words mean shit
I'm sick of it
Time after time
Nothing but lies

I trust no-one but myself
Expect no-one else to help
It's a cruel world in which we live
Everyone takes. No one gives

Good friends are hard to find
Some times you let them slip by
Now you're left all alone
One these empty streets you roam
