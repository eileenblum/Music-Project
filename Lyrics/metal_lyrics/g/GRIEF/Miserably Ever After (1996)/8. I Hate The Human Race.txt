I hate them all - Mankind should be erased
I'll watch them fall - From the world they create
They'll kill themselves - They control their own fate
No stopping now - Because it is too late

I hate the human race - What a fucking disgrace
I hate the human race - I'll smash your ugly face

Destroy the earth - What you one day will do
What's your life worth? - Not much. Once you are through
A world of hurt - You subject yourself to
No sign of birth - The end of me and you

I hate the human race - What a fucking disgrace
I hate the human race - I'll smash your ugly face
