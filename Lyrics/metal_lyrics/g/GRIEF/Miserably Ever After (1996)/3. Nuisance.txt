Buzzing in my ear - like a fly around my head
I turn and you are there
You have been so mislead

Believing that I am something I'm not

Like a lost dog you always follow me
Searching for a friend to ease your insecurity

Misguided fool, your disturbed mind is shot

Like a thorn in my side
A never-ending pain
How long will it take before my patience is drained?

I need you like I need a hole in my head
