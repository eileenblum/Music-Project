[Saint Vitus Cover]

I don't need the madness that society breeds
I don't need the pressure comin' down on me
Why must you always stare, I ain't no fucking clown
Just want to live without somebody bringing me down

[Chorus:]
All I want is to live my life
Easy and free
I don't need
No human bullshit
Prejudice, down on me

Everywhere I wander, I stick out in the crowd
Constantly fight for relief, abuse from all around
Now my mind is twisting, contemplating revenge
But I won't stoop to their level, I refuse to be like them

[Repeat chorus]

Hard for me to be happy with sadness all around
Real easy to be angry, ain't no problem to frown
You'll have to prove to me that what I say is a lie
Cause all I see is hatred splashed before my eyes

[Repeat chorus]
