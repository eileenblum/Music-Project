Here you are, thinking that you're something
An outsider
Trying so hard to be inside
Try to win me over
By any means
Which like yourself
Are a big lie.
Like a deaf person with amnesia -
You hear nothing and remember
Even less.
Deaf, dumb &amp; blind
At best!!!
You are just a waste
Of my time.
How could you think
That I'm so blind.
