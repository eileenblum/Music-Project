Abandoned by the useless system, why?
Tortured screams go unheard.
Released into the hands of someone who
Abused her to the point of death.
Floor mopped with her head,
Bashed against a wall til she was dead.
Violated with tooth and hair brush - genitals burned
Blind to the bruises
Deaf to the screams
The system has failed to the greatest extreme
Cracked addicted mother
thought she had a rag doll.
Treated her 7 year old
Like she was a football.
A system made to serve and protect
Has served no purpose but to neglect.
It was they who committed the crime.
How much longer til another child dies?
