If there's life after death
I'll return a powerful creature
And lead a revolution...against mankind
I'll be the predator...and man will be the hunted
Animals rule the earth
As they did before

[Chorus:]
Predator, carnivore, continue to devour
Man cannot overpower...he continues to cower

Now that I have erased...the entire human race
I've turned the world into...a much better place

[Chorus]

No more system, no more government
No religion, no more presidents
No more pollution, no more toxic waste
The solution, kill the human race
