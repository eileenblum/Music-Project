If the world were flat I'd walk on the edge
Balancing between life and death
Breathe my last breath - take my final step
Freefalling, suffocating, heartstopping - all life ends
Is there a  hell below? No one's sure, I don't know
Or will my soul fall lifeless into the abyss?
My corpse soars through space 
Erosion takes place
If the world were flat I'd walk to the edge and come back
