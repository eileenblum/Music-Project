I bury my head in the earth
Not to hide my ugliness, but to shield my eyes from your horrid world
I used to run free, now you want to eat me
Fuck off you bastards
Why don't you eat yourself?
Human flesh, I'll bet you taste like shit
I'll ram your fucking head in the ground
Trample your body until it is broke
Leave you for the insects to devour
I'm an ostrich
