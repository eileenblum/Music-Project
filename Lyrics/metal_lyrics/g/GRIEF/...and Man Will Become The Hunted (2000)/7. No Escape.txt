I keep asking myself why
Why are people so god damned blind?
When will mankind realize?
We're to blame for the earth's demise
Rape the earth for all that it's worth
Use up its last natural resource?!
With each day it keeps on getting worse
Destroy habitats with no remorse
No escape - no escape from your fate
Now I wait - now I wait patiently
Future looks bleak - there is no hope
I smoke and drink just to cope
Global genocide is no joke
Hang the whole world with one big rope
No escape - no escape from your fate
Now I wait - now I wait patiently
