All I can see - darkness in front of me
For the time being - how long? We'll wait and see
Patience thinning - Try to think positively
That's not easy - so used to negativity
I am so sick and tired of being pissed
I must find peace
These feelings must be dismissed
It's no sure thing that I'll find happiness
Because we know it ften turns to sadness
Here we are...my old friend
Down in the...dumps again
