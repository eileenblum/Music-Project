I am a one-ton, armor plated;
living breathing being
I wade in streams all day;
eat grass; and little else
then one day my world was shattered
by freakish two-legged beings
wielding instruments of pain
hell-bent on striking me down

a super-psyochotic need
to make me and scream and bleed
brought on solely by greed
I only want to be free

if I had my way, I'd stomp you flat
under my bulk
or ram this horn you so crave
into your fucking throat
I'll topple the noisy creatures
in which you flee
but I'll never understand
why you want me to die
