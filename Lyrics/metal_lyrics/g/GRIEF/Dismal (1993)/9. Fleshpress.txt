millions upon millions
I can't even count
pointless human butchery
will it ever stop
men, women and children
a never ceasing flow of life
thrust into horrid death chambers
to satisfy the fuhrer's blight

administer the poison
the deadly zyklon b
the fucking nazi bastards laugh
while everone else screams
the bodies packed so tight
so tight you can't believe
roasting pits and mass graves
conceal this atrocity

six million dead - for nothing
