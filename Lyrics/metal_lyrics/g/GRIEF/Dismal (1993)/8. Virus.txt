unleashed upon
an unsuspecting mankind
millions affected
soon millions more will follow
a horrid plague
exterminates the human race
now know cure
the death toll keeps on rising

humanity is wiped out

loved ones and friends
in grievance of their losses
while institutions
get rich off the unfortunate
skin and tissue
transformed into a grotesque mess
left to suffe
and slowly just waste away

lost reasons for living
