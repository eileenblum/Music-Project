too many
fucking people
I don't know why
but people make me angry
inner segregation

isolated
solitude
depressed reality
saves my sanity

happiness is a state of mind
sadness
fills all minds all the time
we are not alive

I wish I'd never see
another human again
keep my hostile thoughts to myself
I'd rather be alone
