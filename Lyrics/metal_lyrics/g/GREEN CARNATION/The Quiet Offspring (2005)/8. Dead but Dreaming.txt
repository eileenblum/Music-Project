[music: Tchort, lyrics: Tchort]

If there were no darkness
There would be no light
If there were no rain
There would be tears in my eyes
I am life I am death
Before you see the light
You must take your last breath 
I don't feel what I am supposed to feel
I don't dream what I am supposed to dream
I don't say what I am supposed to say
I don't see what I am supposed to see

Dead but dreaming
You make me strong and I make you weak
The perfect mismatch and disharmony
Tired are the feet
That crossed the floor
Hell's doing great but I am serving no more

If there were no heaven
There would be no hell
If I couldn't feel
I would probably hurt myself
I open my eyes but I cannot see
The people I looked up to are not for real 

Lonely is the soul empty are the eyes
Vague is the flame that used to burn in your eyes
Knocking before passing through the doors
The love that used to live here
Lives no more
Dead but dreaming, memories remain
The flesh summons pain and I do the same
Silent Anguish and silent scream
She screams for more and that is not a dream
