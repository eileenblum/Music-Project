[music: Stein Roger Sordal, lyrics: Stein Roger Sordal]

I've been badly beaten
But somehow I've stumbled on
And this wonderland you planed for me
Never felt like home
And the more I tried the more I realized 

I don't believe in things I cannot see
I've had enough
Don't you understand I'm half the man?
I've said enough
The life I used to live I have left behind
The pile of doubt you had in me went on to shine I am over
I am gathered, strong unstoppable

You remember how I used to be
You remember a connection so strong
You remember how sweet it was
You remember only you
But the more I tried the more I realized

I don't believe in things I cannot see
I've had enough
Don't you understand I'm half the man?
I've said enough
The life I used to live I have left behind
The pile of doubt you had in me went on to shine

I am over
I am gathered, strong unstoppable

I don't believe in things I cannot see
I've had enough
Don't you understand I'm half the man?
I've said enough
The life I used to live I have left behind
The pile of doubt you had in me went on to shine
