[music: Stein Roger Sordal, lyrics: Stein Roger Sordal]

A face will tell you stories 
Some hands will always seem to care 
The fading light that blur you mind 
You stumble on with your given time 

She'll kiss the sorrow goodbye 
The everlasting moment is divine 

You have a thousand reasons 
But need only one to justify a cause 
No one will ever teach you 
The hunger you had slightly out of touch 

She'll kiss the sorrow goodbye 
The everlasting moment is divine 

She'll kiss the sorrow goodbye 
The everlasting moment is divine 

Hey sister, take them with you 
Hey brother, hurt will make you strong 
Your tears will turn to laughter 
A last look back and then your on 

She'll kiss the sorrow goodbye 
The everlasting moment is divine 

She'll kiss the sorrow goodbye 
The everlasting moment is divine
