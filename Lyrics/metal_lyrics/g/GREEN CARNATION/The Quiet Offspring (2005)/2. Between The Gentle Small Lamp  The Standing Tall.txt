[music: Stein R. Sordal, lyrics Stein R. Sordal]

I'm on a roll today; I'm on a positive 
On my way for make believe 
I'm on a higher ground down by the open doors 
I've seen a black hole spark on my way through the dark 

Come on down, bring it on, come on down 

Dance to my symphony, the marble of all sound 
The screaming in you ear, yeah I welcome you 
Explore the solitude; it's all flesh and bone 
You'll sweat it out cold as stone 

Come on down, bring it on, come on down 
The mother of dreams as real as anything 

So here is my demand, a possibility 
Some will fall and some will get it all 
There is a thinner line between the rise and fall 
Between the gentle small and the standing tall 

Bring it on, come on down, bring it on 
The mother of dreams as real as anything 

Let me keep my distance for a while 
I'm not ready to go back 

Bring it on, come on down; bring it on, come on down Bring it on
