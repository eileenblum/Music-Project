[music: Stein Roger Sordal, lyrics: Stein Roger Sordal]

I am your needle; 
I am your option out of here, it's that simple 
Oh, I can guide you, 
Through all you fears you'll come out strong, come join me 

So save me, I'm falling 
And I don't have the strength to go on 
I need this, I breathe this 
So empty, afraid and alone 

Well, we go way back 
But now's the time to let it go, I dare you 
Across the border something's waiting 
Some kind of change, the kind silence 

So save me, I'm falling 
And I don't have the strength to go on 
I need this, I breathe this 
So empty, afraid and alone
