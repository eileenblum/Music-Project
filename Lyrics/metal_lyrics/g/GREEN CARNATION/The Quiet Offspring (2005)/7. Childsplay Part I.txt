[music: Tchort, lyrics: Tchort]

Sun setting on a sweet summers day 
The sound of children playing a wicked game 
Leaving stains on the soul 
Twilight crawled across the sky 
Dark Shadows - rushed me 

At the end of the day, 
Will they talk of me? 
Did anyone see me play? 
Did anyone want me to stay? 

Alone again, this is the end my friend 
Torn between you and me, this is the end 
Sun setting on a sweet summers day 
The sound of children playing a wicked game 
Leaving stains, on the soul 

Twilight crawled across the sky 
Did anyone say goodbye? 
Did anyone see you? 
The playground is empty now 
The children play no more 
The game is over 

A ball is lying still 
Painted circle, a child's thrill 
The game is over 
Lying on my back watching the stars 
Another sunrise, another sunset passes by 
Lying down to take a rest:forever
