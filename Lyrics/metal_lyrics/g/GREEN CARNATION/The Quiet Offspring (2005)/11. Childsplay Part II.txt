[music: Bernt A. Moen, lyrics: Tchort ]

Sun setting on a sweet summers day
The sound of children playing a wicked game
Leaving stains, on the soul
Twilight crawled across the sky
Did anyone say goodbye?
Did anyone see you?

The playground is empty now
The game is over
Lying on my back
The Game Is Over
