[music: Michael S. Krumins &amp; Kenneth Silden, lyrics: Stein Roger Sordal]

I'm covered up with time 
The only one you'll find 
I gaze beyond the words 
We'll find it all somehow 
Just leave the rest to me 

You're on to something new 
There's a false and there's a true 
It lingers in your mind 
Can you find a place for me? 
And ignore what you've denied 
For so long Denied for so long 

Twisting and turning 
I'm going for the same direction turning 
Misguided by imagination turning 
Underneath surface I rest 
Twisting and turning 
I'm going for the same direction turning 
Misguided by imagination turning 
Underneath surface I rest
