[music: Tchort, lyrics Tchort ]

Death appears in me 
No fate is what I see 
Sanity reviews 
Reaching out her cold, cold hand 

I drowned love 
I drowned hope 
Changing the way it goes 
Changing how it all flows 
Changing how it all flows 

Just when you think it is safe 
To go back out again 
I am still around you 
Just when you think it is safe 
To go back out again 
Life is an illusion 

The window facing the street 
The very last thing to see 
The one with the little girl (hanging out) 
My very last moments of light 

I saw her face 
She was so pale 
She had eyes so blue 
And the colour of her skin too 
The colour of her skin too 

Just when you think it is safe 
To go back out again 
I am still around you 
Just when you think it is safe 
To go back out again 
Life is an illusion
