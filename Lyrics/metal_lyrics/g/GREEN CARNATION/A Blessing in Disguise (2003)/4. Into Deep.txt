[music: Tchort, lyrics: Kjetil N]

Drowning slowly 
In my own sea 
Fading lonely 
Into deep 

Pushed too hard 
Pushed too far 
Into deep 

Fell too hard 
Fell too far 
Into deep 

Feel my pity 
Cause I am down 
Into deep 

I waited for something to happen 
For someone to save me
Praying for something to happen
For someone to lift me 

But I kept falling down 

Mute my eyes 
Sacrifice 
The dream that will always be there 
Mute my eyes 
Neutralize 
The dream that will always be there 

Pushed too hard 
Pushed too far 
Into deep 

Fell too hard 
Fell too far 
Into deep 

I waited for something to happen 
For someone to save me 
Praying for something to happen 
For someone to lift me 

But I kept falling down
