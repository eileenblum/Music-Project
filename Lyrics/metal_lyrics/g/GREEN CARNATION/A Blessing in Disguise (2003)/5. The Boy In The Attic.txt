[music: Tchort, lyrics: Tchort]

A blessing from below, born a sweet child like foretold 
Could it the boy that I used to be 
Oh, father please forgive me if I`ve done you wrong 
For how long will you let me suffer all alone 

Father! Please!

A father`s touch, a beating one too much 

Hiding in the closet waiting for him to sleep 
What others saw of me, was what dad wanted them to see 

Father! Please! 

I want to taste the free, like nothing ever used to be 
I want to taste what is mine 
Am I evil, could it be, that I am the one they fear 
Look at me, I am the sweetest one you`ll ever see 

I made it through the old into a brand new life 
No more hiding in the closet, waiting for him to sleep 

Into the shadows of old 
Strange memories of time gone 

I was never rightfully yours 
Storys like mine, that were never told 
Out of the window feeling free 
That is how I killed me...
