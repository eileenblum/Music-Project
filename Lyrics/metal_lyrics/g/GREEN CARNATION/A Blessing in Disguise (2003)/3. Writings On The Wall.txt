[music: Tchort, lyrics: Tchort]

Kill me... Down by the shore 
I can feel it... She is not here anymore 
Hear my call... It`s born by the breeze 
Tell me... To where do I go? 

I would beg, I would plead 
But you were still going to leave 
The message that I couldn`t see 
Lying on the floor 
The writings on the wall 

Meet me... In the forest, come alone 
See the lights... It`s my car coming down the road 
I want you... Queen of bizarre 
Days of love, like an arrow shot right through the heart 

I would beg, I would plead 
But you were still going to leave 
The message that I couldn`t see 
Lying on the floor
The writings on the wall 

A shadow cast falls from me over you 
Lying on the floor 
With the hammer raised to let you know 
When the passion dissolves 
The blood on the walls 

Kill me... Down by the shore 
I can feel it... She is not here anymore 
Hear my call... It`s born by the breeze 
Tell me... To where do I go? 

I would beg, I would plead 
But you were still going to leave 
The message that I couldn`t see 
Lying on the floor 
The writings on the wall 

A shadow cast falls from me over you 
Lying on the floor 
With the hammer raised to let you know 
When the passion dissolves 
The blood on the walls 

I would beg, I would plead 
But you were still going to leave 
The message that I couldn`t see 
When the passion dissolves 
The blood on the walls
