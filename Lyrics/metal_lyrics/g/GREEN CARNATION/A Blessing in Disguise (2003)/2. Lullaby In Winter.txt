[music: Tchort, lyrics: Kjetil N]

When tomorrow comes 
All your worrries fly 
Hear the lullaby 

All will be soft and warm 
You will be safe and strong 
Hear the lullaby 

Can you recall the light? 

I know you`re sad because it`s winter
But I can promise you a spring 
I know you`re cold, I see you shiver 
But I can promise you a spring 

Tomorrow`s new 
Tomorrow`s warm 
Remember, when you`re all alone 

I know you`re hurt, I feel it in my heart
But I can promise you a spring 
I see you`re down, I see it in your eyes 
But I can promise you a spring
