[music: Stein R, lyrics: Stein R]

Myron and Cole had a plan heading of to another world 
Inhaling an acre of Myrons sweet garden of pleasure 
Waving goodbye to the rational patterns of thinking 

High above, swans sails the orbits of earth 
Waiting for peace below 
Dying to go with the flow 

Cole starts to shiver, 
he`s sweating and swears that an angel`s here 
He`s crying while speaking of colors which does not exist 

Let me bleed for knowledge an angel possess 
Speak to the world through me 
I live for a reason to be 

Myron stood up and he laughed in his moment of clarity 
Said to his friend "are we ever to come to our senses?" 

High above, swans sails the orbits of earth 
Waiting for peace below 
Dying to go with the flow
