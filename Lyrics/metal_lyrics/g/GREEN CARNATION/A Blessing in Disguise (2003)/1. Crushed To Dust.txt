[music: Stein R, lyrics Stein R]

He took a long look in the mirror 
Shook his head 
Felt the arms of God letting go 
Couldn`t breathe 
It had to stop 
Voices screaming out inside of him 
The world was turning black 
Cold, cruel and vicious 
Time was knocking on a closing door 
Wanting more 

Playing pieces of a life long play 
In which the starring actor 
Makes the world go around inside his head 
Then suddenly the act is ending 
The lights are dimming and the music`s fading 

There was a woman lying on the floor 
Blueish, pale 
Staring a hole through his soul 
There was blood underneath 
The shotgun lying next too her 
He mumbled "am I closer now 
Is this the path that God has chosen out for me?" 

Playing pieces of a life long play 
In which the starring actor 
Makes the world go around inside his head 
Then suddenly the act is ending 
The lights are dimming and the music`s fading 

"Cut", he said. "Let`s wrap it up! We`re finished here!" 

Playing pieces of a life long play 
In which the starring actor 
Makes the world go around inside his head 
Then suddenly the act is ending 
The lights are dimming and the music`s fading
