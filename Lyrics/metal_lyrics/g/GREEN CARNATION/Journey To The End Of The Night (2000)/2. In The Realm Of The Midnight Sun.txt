Black lights, shattered dreams, broken hope
shadows over my pale face
around the storm once again rage
and the wind blow hard and cold while the northern light
dances its sad dance
The Moon throws its freezing light, and warm my frozen soul
world have casted me and pushed me down into a darkness
where only cold and fear can reach me
i am alone, even my tears leave me and dissapear...
I sink deeper, stumbling through the vast labyrinth of sadness
the track i follow, lead me down to an ocean of sorrow and pain
the way back to the light is too long and i dont have
the strength enough....
On the beach by the ocean of sorrow
my soul finds rest and i fall into eternal sleep
here in the realm of darkness....
