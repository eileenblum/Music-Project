Soft rain falls silent down from a black nightsky
darkness which I have given my lonely life to
lay around me like a heavy cloud...
Everything is beautiful, like death is beautiful
sometime I shall wander here in the realm of darkness
with my princess by my side
dressed in the colours of the night
like I am dressed in the colours of the night...
Sometime, I shall share this shivering happiness
with one my heart shall choose
Those who in the night dance....
Cold winds of the fall blow from east
shadows fall over the tower in the distance...
Darkness returns
grows bigger and more powerful over the nightsky
Under eternal stars
under the wings of the screaming raven
I enter the embrace of the fogwoods
Passionated by darkness
longing for the night
I rest alone, as a child of darkness
as a child of fall, as a child of lonliness
Silent I let my soul wander towards the cold light of the moon
letting the first nightstar guard me....
The eternal dawn lower over the northern landscape
there - under eternal stars...
