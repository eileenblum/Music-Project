The wind is playing in the treetops
the first nightstar glow weak and the lantern of sorrow
gives its sad light to the darkest depths.....
In my embrace I carry you towards your lonely resting place
dressed in the colours of the night
Your pale skin lights up the night
I kiss your hand goodbye
and lay you tenderfull down in your grave
and dress your naked body with dust
ah, my dear - what loss
ah, my love - what desire
Darkness of time surrounds my world
Closing me out from life
the long vail of sorrow lay around my pale neck and strangles me
fragments of my actions, my mistakes, passes my blood shot eyes
Dreams of your loss, my sorrow, cuts through my soul
as I enter 5 years of misery, I kiss you farewell
and enter the dark tomb with you...
To death you lost, against darkness you struggle was short
may the children of the night take your soul
I wish you luck on your long travel, to the end of the night...
Your loss will be remembered
Your fall will be revenged
