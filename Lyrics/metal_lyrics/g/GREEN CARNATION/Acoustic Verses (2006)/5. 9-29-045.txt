[Part one: My Greater Cause]

As I ran down the street all the
Faces appeared to me one by one
By the fifth I took a sudden turn
The melting snow revealed the bodies
Buried long ago
All the violence a man can take
Broken bones, and broken homes
Beneath my feet

On the dark side
We'll meet again
And cook it up for one more dance
It's who we are

But I swear it'll be my last
And if I go, I go alone

In the eyes of elephant
Nothing's too big and no one
Proves you're wrong
But the kind they had to offer
Didn't do me any good
It barely cracked the softer shell

On the dark side
We'll meet again
And cook it up for one more dance
It's who we are

But I swear it'll be my last
And if I go, I go alone
Yes I failed and I can't go back
I'm wasted beyond my years
And I breath to let it go

All that I wanted was to slip away
For a little while
Cause I felt alone
And couldn't keep up with the world

[Part Three: House Of Cards]

Where am I?
They're all gone
All is black and white
I think I have passed on

All so warm
All so calm
All these worries shutting down
Something's wrong
Something's wrong

Is it really you?

A moment of...
And they're all gone
If I could close my eyes
I'm sure I'd disappear

Here they come
Pulling me up from the mud
I've failed yet I'm holding on
Here they come
I'm hiding in vain
My shadow and I
In our house of cards

Never did I question myself for the truth
There never was a greater cause
Never did I open my eyes for you
But there it was my greater cause

Here they come
Pulling me up from the mud
I've failed yet I'm holding on
Here they come
I'm hiding in vain
My shadow and I
In our house of cards
