Hear that something... A pale misty sound
The more things change the more they stay the same
Heading out on high tide waves
Not afraid to fall, I'm older now, still standing tall

I'm holding head above water
Ain't going down
I'm holding head above water
Ain't going drown, Ain't going drown
I'm holding head above water
Can't hold me tied
I'm holding head above water
You can't break me... Shredded

I've spoke in different words... A grey soar voice
Different lines, remain the same
Heading out on high tide waves
Not afraid to fall, I'm older now, still standing tall

On this quest for answers, shaped my eyes
Without anger, wasted line
Cant you sense this feeling, feel it flow
I'm stronger now, let the tension go

I'm holding head above water
Ain't going down
I'm holding head above water
Ain't going drown, Ain't going drown
I'm holding head above water
Can't hold me tied
I'm holding head above water
You can't break me... Shredded
