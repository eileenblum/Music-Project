[bonus track]

If I where a minstrel
I'd sing you six love songs to tell the whole world of the love that we share

If I where a merchant
I'd bring you six diamonds with six blood red roses for my love to wear

But I am a simple man a poor common farmer
So take my six ribbons to tie back your hair
Yellow and brown, blue as the sky, red as my blood, green as your eye.

If I were a nobleman
I'd bring you six palaces with six hundred servants for comforting care
But I am a simple man a poor common farmer
So take my six ribbons to tie back your hair

If I where a minstrel
I'd sing you six love songs to tell the whole world of the love that we share
So be not afraid, my love
You're never alone, love while you wear my ribbons tying back your hair

Once I was a simple man a poor common farmer I gave you six ribbons to tie back your hair

Tooralee, tooralie
All I can share is only six ribbons to tie back your hair

Tooralee, tooralie
All I can share is only six ribbons to tie back your hair
