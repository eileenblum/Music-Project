It's something you are born with
And you take it to the grave
It hits you with full power
Like a massive shock wave

After all the tears, blood and sweat
There will be nothing to regret
That's what makes us survive
We're anvilised for life!

It's something that we have to do
We're never gonna quit
If it is not a struggle
It isn't worth a bit

After all the tears, blood and sweat
There will be nothing to regret
That's what makes us survive
We're anvilised for life!

You run out of time
You gotta do it now
You need to realise it while you can
We mean what we say
And we could swaer to death
We're gonna do it till we're old men

This is dedication
That's that's taking me
We're gonna fucking do it
It's all we wanna be

After all the tears, blood and sweat
There will be nothing to regret
That's what makes us survive
We're anvilised for life!

Some things go wrong
At least we even try
Everything we can ot make it fit
But this is the deal
That's dedication, pal
We're never gonna quit we live for it

Anvilised
We're gonna do it till we're old
Anvilised
Anvilised
We realise what we have told
Anvilised - For life
Anvilised
This is dedication, man
Anvilised
Anvilised
We realise it while we can
Anvilised - For life
Anvilised
