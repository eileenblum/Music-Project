Into the black
Into the black

Black claws are piercing through me
Wreck down and paralyse
For letting demons own me
I will now pay the price
My worn down, weakened spirit
Is where my demons dwell
Beyond all bearing that I
Drag myself into hell

Each day Iâm eaten out by
This cancer of my soul
My self-inflicted breakdown
âS about to take its toll
Pitch black enchaining numbness
Rips my mind apart
Iâm close to giving up to
The blackness in my heart

Into the black
Into the black

Leaning frightened on the sink
With your mind state on the brink
Looking deep down the drain
And your life does just the same

The grinning face in the glass
Laughs at your pathetic state
You think how to save your ass
But now it is way too late

The black cloud over me is lurking
Eager to rain pest on me
Pouring down this heavy burden
So heavy that it carries me

This massive weight is on its way
To crush my chest and crack my back
This pitch black viscous gravity
Drags me down into the black
