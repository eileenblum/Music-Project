Virtual, reality, another battle won
The war of real life got out of hand
Rejected by surroundings, nothing more to lose
Getting ready for the final stand
My friend gives me strength to do
Whatever thatâs needed to be done
Making daddy proud, he was the one who taught
How it feels to hold it in my hand
To use it when I must, now the time has come
Now Iâm ready for the final stand

Scholar eclipse
Screaming, aiming, fire

Entering the stage, final level in my game
The ultimate boss-fight is to come
Sneaking through the hall, my last walk on this stage
The war of real life will now be won
There will be no place to hide
Waiting for the first to cross the line
No door will be unlocked, no stone will be unturned
The flood shall flush away all your existence
I show you all my hate, insanity within
Iâm sinking your ship of last resistance

Scholar eclipse
Screaming, aiming, fire
Scholar eclipse
Darkness will fall

No place to run, just a place to die
As my little warriors hit your head
Now who is your god, a king without a crown
His folk of servants dressed in lead
You wonât hear the bell, sing your requiem
Demons took control of my brain
Donât remember what I did, only one chance left
Little friend take away my pain

Scholar eclipse
Screaming, aiming, fire
Scholar eclipse
Darkness will fall
