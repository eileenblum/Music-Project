Like an empty shell
Nothing could ever please me fully
It's not quite like hell
But a happy life I cannot call this
I'm just incomplete
Some most important things still missing
All the more it's sweet
That I found my lucky in something

Dead, dead, dead
Slippery when dead
Dead - Without a will
Dead - No need to kill
Dead - But look ahead
Slippery when dead

Now that I have my toy
I know what I missed in life
I can now enjoy
The pleasures to have my own private toy

Necro-Pleasure

Someone to enjoy
Someone who is only there for me
My own private toy
My secret source of endless pleasure
Yes, a corpse to play
Willing to be screwed the hard way
But one thing is to say
Sadly they get slippery when

Dead, dead, dead
Slippery when dead
Dead - Without a will
Dead - No need to kill
Dead - But look ahead
Slippery when dead

Dead, dead, dead
Slippery when dead
Dead - Without a will
Dead - No need to kill
Dead - But look ahead
Slippery when dead
