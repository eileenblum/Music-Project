Why I hate
You wanna know
A simple thing
I wanna show
How it began to grow immortal hate

The problem is
The open eye
You wish you dead
Youâd rather die
Than being feasted by immortal hate

Yeah â This hate it burns like fire
Yeah â Incineratingâ¦ fire

Although itâs eating me
Iâm damned to hate because I see
You cannot close the once perceiving eye

This is why I hate
To see is tto accept my fate
This is why I hate

I hate so much
Because I know
Every glimpse
The demons grow
Awareness banned me to immortal hate

Close my eyes and wash away my hate

Whatever good
Could never weigh
Out the bad
To this day
Undying roots of immortal hate

Yeah â This hate it burns like fire
Yeah â Incineratingâ¦ fire

This is why I hate
To see is to accept my fate
This is why I hate

Hate
