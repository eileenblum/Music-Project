What happens at night controls my day
But what the hell I don't sleep anyway
A drug driven mind without being stoned

Behind closed eyes my demons take over contral
Bit by bit they annihilate my soul
I resist to sleep for not getting dragged into hell
I'm footsteps away from a padded cell

Never dare to sleep
For my sanity to keep - Insomniaddict

What's the point to sleep
When I'm just cracking deep - Insomniaddict

I'd rather wear myself down
Than deliver me to hell

Never dare to sleep
For my sanity to keep - Insomniaddict

What's the point to sleep
When I'm just cracking deep - Insomniaddict
The fear of what awaits me in the dark drives me insane
In the night I am victim to their mind-fucking game
If I can't break this circle I am soon to break
To stay alive I rather stay awake

Never dare to sleep
For my sanity to keep - Insomniaddict

What's the point to sleep
When I'm just cracking deep - Insomniaddict
