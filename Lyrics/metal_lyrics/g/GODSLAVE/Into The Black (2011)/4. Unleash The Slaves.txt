Imprisoned, beaten, scarred
Wasted lives, families torn apart
Resistance futile, escape will fail
One by one, they take us away

Fight, for your life
Flee, from camp terror
Escape, to freedom outside
Break up chains of rust

Fight for your life ... FIGHT!
Flee from camp terror ... TERROR!
Escape to freedom ... ESCAPE!
Unleash the slaves!

Break up the chains, release them from pain
The wit now is over, let's unleash the slaves!
Unshackle their bonds, release them from terror
Their wait finally finished, let's unleash the slaves!

Shattered, broken bodies
Brutal battle raging here
Oppression over, chains are gone
It's liberty or death

Run, fight, prevail
Enemy, attacks with might
Chop them all dead
To victory we fight

Run, fight, prevail ... RUN!
The enemy attacks ... ATTACKS!
Chop them all dead ... DEAD!
To victory we fight!

Break up the chains, release them from pain
The wit now is over, let's unleash the slaves!
Unshackle their bonds, release them from terror
Their wait finally finished, let's unleash the slaves!

Fight, for your life
Flee, from camp terror
Escape, to freedom outside
Break up chains of rust

Fight for your life ... FIGHT!
Flee from camp terror ... TERROR!
Escape to freedom .. ESCAPE!
Unleash the slaves!

Break up the chains, release them from pain
The wit now is over, let's unleash the slaves!
Unshackle their bonds, release them from terror
Their wait finally finished, let's unleash the slaves!

Unleash the slaves
Unleash the slaves
