It's a deep-rooted urgent desire
That's crawling up in my mind
To trash, to destroy, set on fire
Everything I can find

Piece by piece with fatal energy
A struggle within out of mental slavery
You won't find no reason to exist
When sergeant d is coming and you're on his list

When this drive takes over the action
I can't guarantee anything
What I'm doing is just a reaction
Look ahead what I'm about to bring

Piece by piece with fatal energy
A struggle within out of mental slavery
Kill 'em all, like father like gun
... and then there were none

Trashed
Trashed

No one understands, no one gets it
Who never experienced the same
The smell of terror inside the pit
The drive to enlighten the flame

Piece by piece with fatal energy
A struggle within out of mental slavery
The final curtain falls on the brave
At the end of the day, I spit on your grave

Trashed
Trashed
Trashed
Burn the stage to the ground
Time to kill
Trashed unbound
Trashed
Wreck your neck to the sound
Time to shred
Pound for pound

Trashed
Burn the stage to the ground
Time to kill
Trashed unbound
Trashed
Wreck your neck to the sound
Time to shred
Pound for pound

When the dust has settled upon the
You will know what it's like to trashed
You'll be beaten up but you'll feel free
Your fears and sorrows are smashed

Piece by piece with fatal energy
A struggle within out of mental slavery
I will kill again you people of the lie
No remorse, just survive to die

Trashed
Trashed
Trashed
Burn the stage to the ground
Time to kill
Trashed unbound
Trashed
Wreck your neck to the sound
Time to shred
Pound for pound

Trashed
Burn the stage to the ground
Time to kill
Trashed unbound
Trashed
Wreck your neck to the sound
Time to shred
Pound for pound

Killing is my business and business is good
