A call in the night, a horror never known
Ripped my soul apart, brought terror to my home
They said they found a body, like garbage left to rot
Put down in the hedgerow behind a parking lot

Like â A Shadow
That crawled into my brain and left me numb inside
Raped - And strangled
What has he done to my little child?

What has he done?

Another day â Drink away my pain
Another night â With nightmares to remain
Another death â Came into our life
To spill blood, blood of the innocent

Another day â Drink away my pain
Another night â With nightmares to remain
Another death - To spill her infant blood,
Blood of the innocent

Heâs said to be sick, mental incapacity
Cerebral disorder, victim of society
A disturbance in childhood of this mind insane
The cause of desolation and agonizing pain

Infant â Death
Two small words, just a note in the news
Raped â And strangled
A lifetime of therapy fÃ¼r lethal child abuse

Revenge
Revenge

Now Iâm glad to meet you, your disease is to be cured
Iâll show you ways of healing for the pain that I endured
A blowtorch to your eyes, I feel your pulsing breath
An axe across your limbs, Iâll let you bleed to death

Like â A Shadow
That crawled into my brain and watched you as you died
Crippled â And dead
Mine is the revenge for my little child

Another day â Washed away my pain
Another night â No nightmares to remain
Another death â Came into your life
To spill the blood, blood for the innocent

Another day â Washed away my pain
Another night â No nightmares to remain
Another death â Brought me back to life
