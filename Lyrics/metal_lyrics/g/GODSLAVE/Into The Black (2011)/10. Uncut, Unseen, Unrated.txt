From the living hell to crystal lake
Across a desert of monstrosities
Evil eyes â evil eyes stare deep into your mind
The saw is family down in this shithole
No idea of riddle, summoning the messengers of hell
Angel to some, demon to others
Come on children sing a song âbout the hunter in your dreams
Before the blades of his glove cut your feeble screams
Join us
Deep within the woods, raped by trees alive
These eyes

Uncut â Going to camp blood
Unseen â Face the Elm Street nightmare
Unrated â Take a trip to hell

Take a flight deep into the jungle
Where no one hears you scream as your fleshâs turned inside out
Eaten â Eaten alive, a pile of flesh and bones
Back to the city of the dead
The seven doors of hell kept secret in the book
The book of Eibon, inferno in a frame
Embrace the tribes of the moon living underground
Enter gates of Midian, a night breed to be found
Brains
When thereâs no more room in hell
The dead will walk the earth
Sengaia

Uncut â Going to camp blood
Unseen â Face the Elm Street nightmare
Unrated â Take a trip to hell
Meet your demons and never come back

Theyâre coming to get you, Barbara, seek shelter from the dead
Overrun by savage beasts, aim for their rotten head
X marks the spot
Live or die, make a choice, I wanna play a game
Groovy
Klaatu verata nectu necronomicon
