With honor and prideThe Masters comes back tonightHe spreads his wings of destinyItÂ´s time for one more of Slavery Kneel for us Where the other Bands fallFans of Slavery hear the callYou know we are the kingsAnd you know that a new war begins With raised metallic fistWe stand at the midwinter-mistHear our melodic noiseYou donÂ´t have another choice Kneel for us Where the other Bands fallFans of Slavery hear the callYou know we are the kingsAnd you know that a new war begins With sword and axeWe belong to Mme. TussaudÂ´s waxBelieve that we are not weakWe kill the unbelieving freak Kneel fo us Where the other Bands fallFans of Slavery hear the callYou know we are the kingsAnd you know that a new war begins
