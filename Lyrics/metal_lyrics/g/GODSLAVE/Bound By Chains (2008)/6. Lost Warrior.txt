The Warrior stands aloneThe enemies are superiorAll friends are deadNo hope for escape What shall he do? His fear is giganticThe world colours darkHis sweat drops to the groundHis face is whiteHe throws his weapons to the groundHe wantÂ´s to surrender Now heÂ´s a prisionerThe king pronounces his judgementThey put him into jailHis life is gone away What shall he do? His fear is giganticThe world colours darkHis sweat drops to the groundHis face is whiteHe throws his weapons to the groundHe wantÂ´s to surrender
