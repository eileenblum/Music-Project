I will tell you a tale of the Caribbean Sea
Pirates and vagabonds of 'pay or flee'
An adventure that freezes the blood in your veins

Can you see the crystalline waters?
Stained red by the blood that is spilled
The spell that was cast spreads fear over the lands

For one time their minds were taken over by greed
Stealing the gold of people far mystic and dark
Now they are living eternally as the undead

The essence of the curse took their senses away
No taste and no smell of the pleasures of life
They cannot enjoy what they stole by pillage and burn

Barbossa - where is my ship?
You're gone too far you will pay
How you dare to betray me
I am the captain of the Black Pearl

Beware the curse, the curse of the Black Pearl
Be aware what you're hunting for
Beware the curse, the curse of the Black Pearl
You shall not be taken over by greed

Now they are sailing not living not dead
Through the sea without the pleasures they once had
Attacking and plundering all

They are exposed to living skeletons
When basked in the pale moonlight
They don't live they cannot die

The only way to lift this curse is to return
All pieces of the plundered gold
And spill the blood of its possessor

But they're not counting with the old Jack sparrow
He is the owner of the darkest greatest ship
And he will recapture the Black Pearl

Barbossa - where is my ship?
You're gone too far you will pay
How you dare to betray me
I am the captain of the Black Pearl

Beware the curse, the curse of the Black Pearl
Be aware what you're hunting for
Beware the curse, the curse of the Black Pearl
You shall not be taken over by greed
