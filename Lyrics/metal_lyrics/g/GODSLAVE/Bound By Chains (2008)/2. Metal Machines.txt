We are warriors of steelWe are marching on with prideWe are gonna make you feelThe power of the night With the power from insideNever do what we are toldWe are ready for the fightOur souls cannot be sold We are Metal MachinesMetalians of the stormArmed with Leather and ChainsFor Metal we are born...we are born... Hail to the gods of warAnd into the battle we rideWith a mighty choirFor Metal we will fight We are not mercifulThe blood starts to fallWe kill so powerfulWe can hear your call We are Metal MachinesMetalians of the stormArmed with Leather and ChainsFor Metal we are born...we are born...
