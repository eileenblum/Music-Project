We are bound by chains, bound for the fight
Anger screaming
We raise our fists and scream through the night
Watch them bleeding

Metal screaming
Power feeding

Tear down the walls, all hail to steel
Hail to steel
A burning fire is what we feel
Metal we feel

Metal in our veins is burning hot
Feel the heat
With the metal princess we tied the knot
Down to my feet

Metal screaming
Power feeding

Bound - bound by chains
Bound - where metal reigns

What shall we do, when the world goes mad
Be aware
There's no difference between good and bad
We donÂ´t care

We will killÂ´em all who stand in our way
Bloody liar
For they donÂ´t care what we have to say
Burn in the fire

Metal screaming
Power feeding

Bound - bound by chains
Bound - where metal reigns
