A mass in the nursery
With my saints on a tube TV
Imprinted in my memory

I remember how hard I tried to get the splits done right
I rather broke my bones, injured certain zones, never won a kumite flight

Staring at the screen hypnotized
Gasping for breath paralyzed
A decade that really epitomized
The heroes we all idolized

You changed your job to be a kindergarten cop
Thatâs what a raw dealâs meant to be

I desired to fight by your side, killing everyone whoâs got in view
But instead of blowing off a head, I just made a light shine blue

Staring at the screen hypnotized
Gasping for breath paralyzed
A decade that really epitomized
The heroes we all idolized

Studied martial arts, you taught me all Iâd need, a ninja the American way
I had this vision being on a mission, but I lacked your fingerâs DNA

Staring at the screen hypnotized
Gasping for breath paralyzed
A decade that really epitomized
The heroes we all idolized

Loved this trick, they call it roundhouse kick
Many times I tied my legs in knots

There was one single man, larger than life, a man to reign and rule it all
He talked to his car, became a superstar, his voice teared down the German wall

Staring at the screen hypnotized
Gasping for breath paralyzed
A decade that really epitomized
The heroes we all idolized
