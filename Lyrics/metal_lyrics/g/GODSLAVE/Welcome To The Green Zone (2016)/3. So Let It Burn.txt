Wake up â come to your feet and shake off all the dust
Rise up â shake your bones and get rid of all the rust
Allow your desires to call the action and take what you just aspire
Tear down the walls that hold you back, so knock them down and LIGHT THE FIRE

Stand up â look straight and grab what seems out of reach
Get down â get down to business and practice what you preach

I see the fire that burns in you
So let it through
Youâve got yet so much to learn
So let it fucking burn

Step back â not to slow down but to take a running start
Join in â with the goal to take over and not just to take part
I see the fire that burns inside you, come let the sparks throw higher
Donât let this blaze cool off, you should feed it to flames and IGNITE A FIRE

Man up â banish the cold and allow the heat to burn
Wake up â open your mind and allow yourself to learn

I see the fire that burns in you
So let it through
Youâve got yet so much to learn
So let it fucking burn

Burn up â let your eyes catch fire, let your heart feel the blaze
Straighten up â donât deny youâre in fire in so many ways
Engulf in the flames, let the fire enlight you and give what it does require
Full dedication, will and passion is all what it takes to FEED THE FIRE
Wake up â jump to your feet and get rid of all the dust
Rise up â Move your bones and break them free from rust

I see the fire that burns in you
So let it through
Youâve got yet so much to learn
So let it fucking burn
