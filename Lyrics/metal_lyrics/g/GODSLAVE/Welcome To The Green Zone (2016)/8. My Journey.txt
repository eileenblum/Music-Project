I've been floating 'cross the void
Through time and space
Riding waves of black,
Dark oceans I embrace
Beholding galaxies and watching stars emerge
Drifting on and on,
Carried by the surge

This was my time to dwell
I know I will be well
This is the time for me to part my well-known shore
I will embrace whatever lies behind that door

Quasars and wormholes
Charily nudged out the way
Twisting through corridors
No chance to go astray

This was my time to dwell
I know I will be well
This is the time for me to part my well-known shore
I will embrace whatever lies behind that door

My time is now

The wheel in the sky keeps on turning
I don't know where I'll be

I've been wondering the paths of no return
Getting near the line where thousands suns will burn
Being prepared to fall, await the time to dive
Into this lake of cold, this stormy sea of life

This was my time to dwell
I know I will be well
This is the time for me to part my well-known shore
I will embrace whatever lies behind that door

The time I see the light and feel the gravity
My journey leads me to another entity
This is the time for me to part my well-known shore
I will embrace whatever lies behind that door

This was my time to dwell
I know I will be well
I will be well
