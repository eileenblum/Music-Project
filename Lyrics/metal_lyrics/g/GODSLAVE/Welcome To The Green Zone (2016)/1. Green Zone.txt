Iâm so sick of all what they throw at us
Day in day out â Iâm sick and tired to discuss
I wanna have my time and place alone
Where I decide it all down to the bone

Donât dare to think that I donât want to care
Of what is going on I am aware
I just donât think that I am wrong
Donât wanna have to swallow all day long

One finger â two words
I handle this on my own
One finger â two words
The simple key to my zone
This time and space I now claim
For once to be left alone
From all the terror and blame
They donât exist in my zone

One finger â two words
If you not want me to be
One finger â two words
Fuck You I choose to be free

You too deserve to have your private zone
At least in here the daily grindâs unknown

I bid you welcome to my green zone
Whatâs outside can fucking leave me alone
I donât care shit when in my green zone
Where finally my time is my own

One finger â two words
One finger â two words

One finger â two words
I handle this on my own
One finger â two words
The single key to my zone

You too deserve to have your private zone
At least in here the daily grindâs unknown

I bid you welcome to my green zone
Whatâs outside can fucking leave me alone
I donât care shit when in my green zone
Where finally my time is my own

One finger â two words
