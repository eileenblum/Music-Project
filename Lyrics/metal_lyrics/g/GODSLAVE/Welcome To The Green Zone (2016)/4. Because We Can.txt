We read a porn mag on the train
And dodge paying the fare
Weâre only happy when shit hits the fan
A business meeting with the boss
A âFuck Youâ shirt we wear
Why do we do it: âcause we can

We usually sit down to pee
Wonât close the toilet lid
Be assured that we donât give a damn
We like a good fart in a lift
Weâre never gonna quit
Getting on your wick because we can

WE STICK TO OUR OWN PLAN â FUCK YOU BECAUSE WE CAN

A second helping of dessert
Leftovers on the plate
End this game right before it began
Steal all the sweets off the buffet
Screw being overweight
We love the way we are because we can

On the court we chase the kids
Enjoying our life
A child lies in each and every man
Choose rainy days for barbeque
With meat in pack of five
Everyone enjoys unless vegan

We mow the lawn on Sunday noon
Trust me it wonât be quiet
Maybe you better flee towards Japan
Kicking in the neighbors shed
Ready to start a riot
We really love to fuck up âcause we can

WE STICK TO OUR OWN PLAN â FUCK YOU BECAUSE WE CAN

Bluntly we tell you the truth
Somethingâs gone bloody wrong
In this whole education plan
In case you ask why we attack
Strange lyrics to this song
The answer should be clear: because we can

WE STICK TO OUR OWN PLAN â FUCK YOU BECAUSE WE CAN

We just end what we began
Weâre smarter than the smartest men
We just stick to our own plan
Why? Because we can!
