This is the end of all that happened long before
We even bury yesterday
From this point in time we rewrite all just from the core
Whatâs past and gone we throw away

On nothing we will now depend
This is the end
Now we decide whatâs come to be
This is the end of history

We cut the strings that hold us back with no remorse
We learn the facts that we should know
From this day on we decide and take our fate by force
We will fuck your status quo

On nothing we will now depend
This is the end
Now we decide whatâs come to be
This is the end of history

I fuck the past â I donât need to look back to get fast ahead
I donât want to - always try to think of what I just read
I do decide â what I am gonna do, what I wanna say
Damn you all â everything that holds me back Iâll kick away

This is the end - and I will do a total re-boot
Finally - I will be on the top and celebrate my loot

On nothing we will now depend
This is the end
Now we decide whatâs come to be
This is the end of history
