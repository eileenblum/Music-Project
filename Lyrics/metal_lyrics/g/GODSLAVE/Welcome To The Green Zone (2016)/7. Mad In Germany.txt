Crashing through the stratosphere
Stranded in a catastrophe

If I knew Iâd chose another place to see
Itâs clear to me youâre mad in Germany

Theyâre coming out for me
To have me dragged inside
A screen upon the wall
Will cast the only light

Remore-controlled brain surgery
Suffering visual perversity

People enjoying a good reputation
Displayed in gutter deep down below

In bonds and shackled
With eyes open wide
How can you stand the pain
This media suicide

Tears washed away by serenity
Laughing about some monstrosity

If I knew Iâd chose another place to see
Itâs clear to me youâre mad in Germany

Hysteria and insanity
Look what you have done to me

If I knew Iâd chose another place to see
Itâs clear to me youâre mad in Germany

Iâm sure that no one will be coming
Iâm trapped in a thousand-channel-hell
