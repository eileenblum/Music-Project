We are proud and dedicated
As one, weâre tearing through the black
Whatâs in our way â we terminate it
This is the way of the pack

We pledge allegiance
Through best and worst we will last
We pledge allegiance
Weâre kicking butts with a blast

We share the sacrifice and pain
Our blood is thicker than the black
We are â itâs easy to explain
One crew â one blood â ONE PACK

Weâre bound by blood thatâs pumping through our veins
We are the pack, weâre bursting all our chains
Like a beast, weâre ready to attack
Fuck you all â we are the BLOODBOUND PACK!

Fuck You all!

We are one blood, weâre one crew
Those who oppose â FUCK YOU!
Our attitude may chap your ass
One funny thought, I must confess

With this blood we are born
We are one heart and one soul
Weâre taking this world by storm
Stand back when weâre on our roll

Weâre bound by blood thatâs pumping through our veins
We are the pack, weâre bursting all our chains
Like a beast, weâre ready to attack
Fuck you all â we are the BLOODBOUND PACK!
