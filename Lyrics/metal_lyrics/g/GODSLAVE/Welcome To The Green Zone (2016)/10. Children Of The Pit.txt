[Seba:]
We hear that question every day: "What goal keeps up your game?"
Could madness be our name?
Well, let me tell you something, it's our passion keeping us aflame

[Bacchus:]
Keep laughing at our way to live, you'll never understand
We'll keep the upper hand
The moshcrew's splitting on your graves when you will disappear in no man's land

[Liz:]
We keep up the fight
Like a phoenix we attain the light
We chose the hardest way
Nor defeat nor loss will lead us astray

[Hille:]
Resistance is senseless, it is running through our veins
And sometimes it's blocking our brains
We're a different breed and we are used to breaking all our chains

[Patrick:]
It's our choice
Every night we're boozing with the boys
This is for what we bleed
We eat, sleep, thrash and repeat

[All:]
We are children of the pit
We fight, scratch and claw, we live for it

[Britta:]
I shout it out and scream as hell and I will make you see
The fire walks with me
I am here to make you feel the same, light the fire and set you free

[Maritin:]
I wouldn't change it for a thing, it's been my life for years
The blood, the sweat and the tears
We share our pain and kick through shit, yelling at the night and drink some beers

[Roland:]
They're made to crawl
So bombs drop, another leader falls
The deaf here â still have their voice
To spread the word â no there's no other choice

[All:]
We are children of the pit
We fight, scratch and claw, we live for it
We are children of the pit
We fight, scratch and claw, we're loving it

[Thommy:]
WE are the ones, which take what comes
We fight for what we achieve
We bleed and sweat for what we believe

[All:]
We are children of the pit
We fight, scratch and claw, we live for it
We are children of the pit
We fight, scratch and claw, we're loving it
