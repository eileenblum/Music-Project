From the shadows ascending
I will bring you fire â and devastation
Face your doom impending
As your monuments burn

No black knight descending
To protect you from mere â annihilation
Your world will be ending
Right now, right here

Itâs time to see â to face your fate
Call me the demon, the evil incarnate

See my legion standing tall
Whereâs your knight to avoid your fall
Never again heâll heed your call
Before the demonâs head youâll crawl

This is war â Devastationâs coming nearer
This is war â Your monuments crushing down
This is war â As the smoke is getting clearer
This is war â Just a king without a crown

Into the shadows descending
With no chance of â retaliation
The walls seem to be unending
Too high for your escape

Fear my power extending
As your savior dwells â in desolation
With a smile condescending
Iâll come to claim whatâs mine

I have all the time, all the time I need
Blessed with life eternal, call me the Lazarus breed

See my legion standing tall
Whereâs your knight to avoid your fall
Never again heâll heed your call
Before the demonâs head youâll crawl

This is war â Devastationâs coming nearer
This is war â Your monuments crushing down
This is war â As the smoke is getting clearer
This is war â Just a king without a crown

See my legion standing tall
Whereâs your knight to avoid your fall
Never again heâll heed your call
Before the demonâs head youâll crawl
