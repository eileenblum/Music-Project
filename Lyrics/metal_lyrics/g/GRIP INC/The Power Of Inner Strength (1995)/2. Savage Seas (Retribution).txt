I am beginning of creation
I am the one who gave you life
depending on 3% of my body, fear me
or I will grip you from below, to

saturate you, suffocate ypu
smash the foundation of life

burn me but only at the surface
don't waste your sacrifice on me
the damage is done
choking with black corrosive
pollution
rubbing salt in your wounds, I
will arise to

destroy you, demolish you
rip up, the foundation of life

grip you, from below
grip you, from below

annihilate you, obliterate you
flood the foundation of life
