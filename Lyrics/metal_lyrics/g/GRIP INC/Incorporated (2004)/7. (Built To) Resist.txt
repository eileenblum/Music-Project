Branded, forced into exile
Cinical routine, family union dissolved
Accused, abandonment, dead beat
Admonished, siblings, severed values detached

Hear my children calling
Loud out to me
I won't subscribe to a campaign
Bent on tragedy

[Chorus :]
Build to resist, build to resist
My children I'll come for you

Bonded, subculture formed
Anguish, yearning fills painful spiritless void
Blood flows vested strong and free
Starved from rightful tender physical resolve

Har my children crying
Loud out to me
I won't subscribe to a campaign
Bent on tragedy

[Chorus (2x)]

My children I come for you
