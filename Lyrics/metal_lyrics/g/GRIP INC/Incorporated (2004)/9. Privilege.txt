Severe the senses, dominate, divide
Born from pain
Falling victim to own vengeance again
Born from pain, rise
Push me, shove me, push me down
To see the light, step through the dark

[Chorus :]
Privilege born from pain, privilege born from pain
Empires embossed, embattled cultures
Privilege born frm pain

Heathen, zero identity
Set hem free
Installing fallibilty
Set them free, rise
Push me, shove me, push me down
Endless the moving question

[Chorus (1x)]

[Chorus (1x)]

We are a dying breed
