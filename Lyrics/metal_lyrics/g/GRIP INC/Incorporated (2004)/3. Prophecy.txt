We can't keep something alive
That has no heart
Doing what is good
Is not doing what is right
So the beat goes on

Time has come to be a hero
See your name in bright lights
Swept away with grand illusions
Force fed visions of fame
Your guard is down
You are the hunted
In a corporate world
That has no shame
Contracts signed all hail the new kings
Kept in a state of eternal bliss to be

Stranded like thousands that went before me
Stranded but I will never lay down come on

[Chorus :]
Break out, rise up from oblivion
Rise up, sinners an saints
Break out, rise up from oblivion
Rise up, black sheep shall survive

Bathing in short living glory
Quickly becoming a faded memory
Drowning in the hidden vortex
Overflowed with ruined lives
Beaten by the glamour forces
*harvest fruitful lays between the lies
This phoenix rises out from the ashes
From a light that never goes out

Stranded like thousands that went before me
Stranded but I will never lay down come on

[Chorus (1x)]

Stranded like thousands that went before me
Stranded but I will never lay down
Stranded like thousands that went before me
Stranded but I will never lay down come on

[Chorus (2x)]
