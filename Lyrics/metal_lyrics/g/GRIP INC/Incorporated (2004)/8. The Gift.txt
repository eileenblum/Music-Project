Time heals, time heals old wounds
Bad habits die hard, bad habits die hard
Tired of, tired of self
Tired of selfinfliction, selfinfliction, selfinfliction
No more leaving morals at the door
Cut out the cancer, time to settle the score

Hood-winked divine, partners in crime

[Chorus :]
Present to you the gift that shines
Two hands will deliver, two hands will deliver
Present to you the gift that shines
Reward gift that shines perfect day

impact, impact of pride
Unwanted burdens, unwanted burdens
Conflict, conflict will bring
Conflict will bring aggression, bring suppression, bring depression
No more leaving morals at the door
Cut out the cancer, time to settle the score

Hood-winked divine, partners in crime

[Chorus (1x)]

No honour amongst thieves

[Chorus (1x)]
