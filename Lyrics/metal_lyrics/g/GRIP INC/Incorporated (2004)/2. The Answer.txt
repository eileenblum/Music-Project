All in the answer
All in the answer

Battle call of the fathers
Personnal war of the elite
Hypnotized by symbols
Idols and coloured rags
Condems full attention
Contradicts a way of life
Brother fight my brother
Heritage of the east and west
Orphans of a changing world

Blind leading the blind

[Chorus (2x)]
The question is the way we never
Stand up for what is right
The question is why we always
Stand up for what is wrong

Violence in the name of peace
Triumph of good over evil
Divided by key players
United in creted the rift
Expressed in code warnings
Deliberate deception
Love hate partners sharing
Never ever to unite
Confort your own morality

Blind leading the blind
In fertile fields, searching for answers

[Chorus (2x)]

Blind leading the blind
In fertile fields, searching for answers

Blind leading the blind
In fertile fields, searching for answers

[Chorus (2x)]

All in the answer
