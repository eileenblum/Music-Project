Seal your fate, seal your fate
Seal your fate, seal your fate

Souless, forgotten in time
Deep hunger flows in the veins
Of the anciant
Seducing dreams, spiral in motion
Endless the quest, for life everlasting

fever inside, inside fever
This is not a dream

Faithless, avoiding light
Needless attention, proud to be noticed
Driven by thirst, successers bleed
A vicious beauty, scorned for a thousands yaers

Fever inside, inside fever
This is ot a dream

Pray, bathing in the blood of saints

[Chorus :]
Learn the lesson, cold and bare
From life's sharp razor, life's sharp razor
Cut your fate
Cut your fate
Cut your fate
Smash the sin, expose the sinner
Cut your fate, bathing in the blood of saints

Free from eternal nig ht
Rhymes of resurection crusading as immortal
Transform, the balance shifts
Sexual presentation, addicted to the chase
Blood and music blend together
Sing a song and dance with the devil
Burnig bright, walk in the light
Te embers of youth
Pray to your wretched god

[Chorus :]
Learn the lesson, cold and bare
From life's sharp razor, from life's shrp razor
Cut your fate
Pain and despair, don't stand and stare
A wise man rides on the winds of change
Bathing in the blood of saints

Learn the lesson, cold and bare
From life's sharp razor, life's sharp razor
Cut your fate
Cut your fate
Cut your fate
Smash the sin, expose the sinner
Cut your fate, bathing in the blood of saints
