Lure of the good life, lead into the promised land
Crossing over boarders hand in hand
Giving trust in the face of danger
The battle of control has just begun
Common language, universal tongue
Serving up salvation, liberators, pimps in disguise
Enforcing thresholds to survive
Switching on to satisfy, servants must perform
Foreign acts of desperation, mercantile for existence

Enslaved, abused and betrayed
Trapped in the skin trade, trapped in the skin trade

[Chorus :]
Screaming in silence
Exchanging skin for gold

Messiah, turned traitor, leaves all callous and drained
Providing for hideous and the lame
Enticed into a snare, held in a prison nowcalled home
Executing foul gratification
Exposed to random acts of physical disgust
Compelled to adhere to the captures corrupt mind
Switching on to safety, servants must perform
Foreign acts of desperation, mercantile for existence

Enslaved, abused and betrayed
Trapped in the skin trade, trapped in the skin trade

[Chorus:]
Screaming in silence
Exchanging skin for gold
Slavery sold to, suffering into
Exchanging skin for gold
