What you waiting for
Enemy at my door, what are you waiting for
Demon preacher tracking me, I have no place to run
Enemy in my mind, desperate and sublime
Demon preacher tracking me, I have no place to run

Now you carry my life, fragile with passion
Vigilant the fight, I stand alone

[Chorus:]
Ranting the sermon
On the edge of reason
This is tomorrow calling
And slowly I am drifting away

Anger deep inside my mind
Stealing the sands of time
Constantly confusing me
I have no place to run

Now you carry my life, fragile with passion
Vigilant the fight, I stand alone

[Chorus (1x)]

[Chorus (1x)]

This is tomorrow calling
And slowly I am drifting away
