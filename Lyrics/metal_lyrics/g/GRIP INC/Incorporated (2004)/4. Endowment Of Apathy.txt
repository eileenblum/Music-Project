Born in a city, no more than a wasteland
Flash point, a struggle to the bitter end
Productive life, serenity a god send
Auxiliary a second class citizen
Voice of the future, always a breath away
Opinions moulded, educated to obey
Destined to seclusion and decay
Auxiliary, a second class citizen

Doomed from the womb
Born on the wrong side (of the tracks)
In the wrong postal zone
Doomed from the womb

[Chorus :]
Random, brutal, rough, justice
Tried convicted, endowment of apathy
Random, brutal, rough, justice
Tried convicted, endowment of apathy

Years of grind in substandard luxery
Masses grovel in poverty and misery
Negative, Endowment of apathy
Erosion of pride, faith, integrity
Survive a system, expecting the norm
Broken willed, expressionless born
Trial by fire, walk the plank at dawn
Whitewashed, strippedn peeled and torn

Doomed from the womb
Born on the wrong side

Ambitions, no crime
Ambitions, no crime
Ambitions, no crime
Pre-judged
Ambitions, no crime
Ambitions, no crime
Ambitions, no crime
Pre-judged

[Chorus (1x)]

Doomed from the womb
Judgement has been passed

[Chorus (2x)]
