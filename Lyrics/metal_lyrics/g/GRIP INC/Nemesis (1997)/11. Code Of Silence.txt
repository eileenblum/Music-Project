The silence grows loud
Echoing through the halls
Abandoned by our protectors
No effort to serve, protect
Heartless tunes beat
Swirling behind badge and gun

Allegiance to enwritten low
Depravation shut away

Code of silence Code of silence

Bodies beaten and bloody
No chance of innocence
No effort to step forward
The silence grows louder

1997 Metal Blade Records
