Take the mask off show the fiend
Take the mask off show the fiend
Vows of loyalty fertile the promise
Catch the glimmer follow spinning wheels
Quick easy painless tongues split in two
Beware of wolf hiding under Golden Fleece
Do what you say say what you mean
All for one the rest for me
Take the mask off show the fiend
Don't cry wolf
Don't cry wolf
Don't cry wolf
Don't cry wolf
Power of image consider all your ways
Thin laurels standing with draconian smile
Lies hibernate
Hank eyes roll back
Feeding frenzies expose wolf in sheep's clothing
Do what you say say what you mean
All for one the rest for me
Don't cry wolf
Don't cry wolf
Don't cry wolf
Don't cry wolf
