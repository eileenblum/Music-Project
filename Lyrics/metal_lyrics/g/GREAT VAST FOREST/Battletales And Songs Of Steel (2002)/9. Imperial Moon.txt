The moons describes
The mournful face
Of the goddess lovely
And yours immense pleasures
I follow your light
Until the altar of stones
I see the orgy of the witches
And the barbarian warriors
Of the darkness
They are the children
Of the full moon
At nights of devolution

The imperial moon
Illuminates the ways
Of the forest
A gray fog involves
The image of the black castle
I fell the power of the past
In sights running through
The walls of the cold castle

Old kings govern
The esoteric powers
Setting free the black arts
For a night with eternal eclipse
On remains of the temple
My sacred axe of fire cuts the darkness
Then I follow this journey
Following your immortal face
In the imperial moon
