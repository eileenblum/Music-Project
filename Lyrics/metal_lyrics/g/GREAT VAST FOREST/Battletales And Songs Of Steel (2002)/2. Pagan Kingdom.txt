In the cold ice shadows of the forest
In the black lakes that cross the stones
In the fire that burn the turchs
Live pagan gods of a kingdom without religion

This that blow on the silence of the night
Taken my spirit to horizonts and ancient ages
At the gates of pagan kingdom

In the black triumph castler and bloody battles
On this honor past the flame burns still
Fortify our spirit for the war.
In the perverse kingdom yet

From an obscure kingdom overthere forest
The new pagan age will rise for a hate kingdom
Impure factions will spread like the cruel epidemy
This is the empire that will survive
On the Cornes of the world
Creating the Pagan Kingdom.
