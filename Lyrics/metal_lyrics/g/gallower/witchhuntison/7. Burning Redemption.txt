As the nightâs dark
Stakesâre ready to burn
Peasants gather around
To watch devilâs whores
Last act of mercyâs given
For true our godâs wise
For heaven gatesâre closed
But for hell stay open wide

They'll be cleansed by fire
They'll be cleansed by fire

Smoke being seen from far
as he looks on it
Inquisitor might harden
as witches life pass
Compassion for Satan's servants
Is like venom to him
This such a beautiful pain
giving him an chill

They'll be cleansed by hatred
They'll be cleansed by hatred

Torment
from boiling veins
Flow through his hearth
Madness cry
Obscenity
Insanity
Feeling for he used to kill

Witches
Burning on stakes
Tormented souls
Begging for death
Salvation or
Damnation
Eternal desolation

Speedfire â Drums
