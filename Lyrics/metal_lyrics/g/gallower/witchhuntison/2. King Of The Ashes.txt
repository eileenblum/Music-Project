People just like toys
Without any value
Decisions are mine
Who will live or die
Whose head will roll under the guillotine

Rightful ruler by the law
and leader as I am
Lord of destruction
Who lead us to war

Kingdom awaits for a king
Throne is mine
Love me or hate me
Today pretender, tomorrow I'll be god

Cruel sovereign
Sent by greed
Baptized in lust
My lieges are dirt and castles are dust

Now Iâm king of the ashes
and I rule kingdom of nothing
In my greed world has burn
I wear crown of pestilence

I will be buried in forgotten tomb
as a democracy
Last king that ruled
