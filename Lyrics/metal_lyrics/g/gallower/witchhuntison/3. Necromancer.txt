There was once a man
He called himself
a necromancer
He lived in tower
of forever dark

Contaminating land
and killing life
Gaining power
Arcane of magic
of dark wizard

Black magic
hell
and imps
are his servants
Ready to fight for their master

However his will
was to kill
and torment people
of the corrupted land
in Gallower

Leave no cross unturned
The necromancer
Under his command
World will fall

Leave no man alive
The necromancer
Spit in the face of god

So, disease has spread
evilest plague
Too devastating
to cast the spell

But time is high
and itâs time to die
Tower tremors
Lightning torns the sky

Incantation ready
Moon has a bloody glow
Windâs like sword
Which will cut the world

Word is said,
Thunder roars
Wizard laugh
Disease take itâs toll

Leave no cross unturned
The necromancer
Under his command
World will fall

Leave no man alive
The necromancer
Spit in the face of god
