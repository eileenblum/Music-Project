Ravaged soil, scorched earth
Burned land, unleashed pain

Thou I'll be walking through the valley
of the shadow of death I will feel no fear
Feel no fear

Destructed world, annihilation
Last bastion of mankind, new world creation

Thou Iâm walking through the valley
of the shadow of death Iâm feeling fear
Feeling fear

Blackened light, serpent hiss in your ear
I am wrath, holy light of inquisition

I was bringer of the faith
but holy light has burned
as corpses of dead

Hopeâs lost, desolation
Fire consume us, revelations

Thou I'll be walking through the valley
of the shadow of death I will feel no fear
Feel no fear

So story begins, our hero stands alone
Sacrifice so burn the world build another one

Thou I'll be walking through the valley
of the shadow of death they will fear me
Fear me
