Black candles grin of storm
Pentagram shines away from dawn
Altar bestead on the mountain side
Moonlight night as the evil fights

Witches prepare their fire shrines
Over the forests on the bald top
Fierce force initiates their moves
Gates to hell stay open wide by
Sabbath...

Summoning the cursed dead
scornful screams surround them
Preacher cries his sermon dies
Spectrum rise above us

Cemetery of the living dead
Graves filled with Satan's breed
Unholy ritual
Demons can't be stopped

Descend of the beast from hell
Force you cannot fight
Final hour comes
Sabbatâs gone, better hide

Witches end their black mass
Armoured saint starts to scour
Witchhammer will crush their heads
Sentence to massacre them

Black candles grin of storm
Pentagram vanishes away from dawn
Altar devastated on the mountain side
Moonlit night as the stakes enlight

Witches burnt on fire shrine
Over the forest on the bald top
Even fierce force crucified
Gates to hell stay open wide by Sabbath
