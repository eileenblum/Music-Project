Vicious man in purple robe
Seeking for heretic scum
Spilling blood in name of god

Horrific vision of his victims
Torturing them for their sins
Purifying evil source

All of them will burn in hell
As the crucifix is blazing
Glory of the lamb is spreading

Inquisitor knows no mercy
As he hunting for his preys
Carmine skinned demon called
Inquisitor

There is coming sinners payday, there is coming sinners payday

Bestial, vicious, dread, pain, sacred, vengeance, war, death

Vicious man in purple robe
Seeking for heretic scum
Spilling blood in name of god

Felling like the hand of god
Acting against ten condemnents
Eye for eye and teeth for teeth

Without judgement without court
Day of punishment is delayed
Prosecutor of the human law

Inquisitor knows no mercy
As he hunting for his preys
Carmine skinned demon called
Inquisitor

There is coming sinners payday, there is coming sinners payday

Bestial, vicious, dread, pain, sacred, vengeance, war, death
