Figures robed in black sworn to secrecy
Blazing candles placed in the sing of Baphomet

Watching fires rise
Now we burn the skies

Bound by the spells from the ancient pagan rite
Gaze upon the ram the exalted Satanas
Now we clean the air with unholy scent
Spitting on the cross, honor Astaroth

Watching fires rise
Now we burn the skies

Fear the stench of the cauldron
Satiate the beast
The precious jehovah
Lies dead in spite
Now drink from the chalice
Sip the pleasures of life
Soon we will be enlightened
Bow to the hermaphrodite

Goat of a thousand young

We thrive in the shadows
In darkness we preside
May the cloaked death carry us
Into the flame-licked sky
May the minions rejoice
For our new millenium
Revel, rebel, indulge
While the blind sink into cold burial
