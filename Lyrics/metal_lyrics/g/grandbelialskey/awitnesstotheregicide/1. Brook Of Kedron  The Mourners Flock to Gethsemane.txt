Deepest sleep milleniums away
A dream i've discovered in my conscience
Foot soldiers recruit my body for war
White sprites become targets for assault

Abducted, i'm invalid and unable to breathe
I am gurgling, there is peace in my nightmare
Such tranquil ambience in total darkness
Life is left behind, I pursue a red light, end

A sinful man is kneeling in the garden
Begging for redemption and forgiveness

Civilizations subjected to gruesome disasters
For not accepting the valiant tale of god
A trembling sky and a symbolic sky
Formed the habitat where the innocent disappear

There they said he cried blood
And the son of man was betrayed

The brothers engage in the final aberration
Carrying the pitiful cross unto the sons of sons
Where the father masturbates on their doctrine
And in the crystal ocean they forever perish
