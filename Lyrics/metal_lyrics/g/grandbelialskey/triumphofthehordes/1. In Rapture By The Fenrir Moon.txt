The moon ignites the thyestean flame
Tempestuous winds call out my name
Red orphic rays shine unto me
It's the threshold of lycanthropy

The wanton craving and salacious desire
Kindle my seething promethean fire
The tethered wolf has been unleashed
To hunt and kill voraciously

Diana, take me into thy womb
To thine lunar radiance I swoon
My lustfulness forever blooms
In rapture by the fenrir moon

With mordacious fangs and feral claws
I exercise the primordial laws
My lupine cock is fixed to rise
And fuck the marrow of life

Pious lambs know not satanic truth
"sweetest the tongue, sharpest the tooth"
The dawn ascends and I evade
Back into the woods whence I came
