In the wake of a blazing empire
Face the aeon of torrid fire

Sound the trumpets
War has begun
Gather our minions to render destruction

The abysmal gates are open...

Rape the mother who bred the messiah
Ride the seraphs with namtar and idpa

Bolt of levin cracks the earth open
Demons ascending to ravage the heavens

The hordes of darkness return...

With clashing cymbals and thunderous drums
We call to the gods of abomination
May our hearts be strong and filled with might
To rend and lay waste the disciples of christ

Set churches ablaze with scorching fire
Its embers are lossed by flames of desire
We raise our swords forged in pride
On the primeval wings of chaos we ride
Armageddon! dominion!
The holocaust has claimed its millions
War, we are legion war! thy dark will be done

The tyrant must feel the extent of our hate
Shrieking in torment he'll greet his fate
Upon his throne infernal kingdom wrought
The celestial body condemned to naught

Those who oppose the heathen foe
Shall be cast to fathomless depths below
Darkness shall forever rule supreme
From what once was it eternally
Conquest is granted
Our world without end
