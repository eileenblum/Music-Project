Tonight the moon is full
In the land beyond the forest
The howling of wallachian wolves
A serenade to the dreariest soul

I'm alone
In the confines of my barren home
Bereaved... left behind
Grieving for the one
My ashen bride

A host of ravens hover
From majestic winter mountains
Into my eyes they whisper
A sullen song of melancholy

Five hundred years have passed
Since the flowers blossomed
Green meadows now benighted
And shadows embrace the frozen sun

I'm alone...

[her voice]
"I remember the glorious storms
The wrath of the heavens upon the shores
The erotic winds and their symphonies
Resounding above the elegant trees

I remember the nights spent in thine arms
While making dark love with bestial charm
A setting provided with incessant rain
Sipping the blood from each other's veins"

As mist I travel the dismal skies
Feeding my ravenous appetite
Dreaming of candles and gleaming stars
Bleeding from my lovelorn scars

Once I was a blissful delighted man
Residing over a splendid land
Now a beast of nocturnal guise
Bent to cease my immortal life

[her voice]
"I am longing to touch thee, my love
To bake in the warmth of the skies above
Marvelled by landscapes so picturesque
With thy nestled brow upon my nurturing breast

I yearn to taste the sweet tongue of thy kiss
To dance in the halls of the fiery abyss
Vanquish thy curse and come set me free
Awake me, my darling, from my tortured sleep

Through ethereal dreams I convoke to thee
Like a gentle breeze upon a reposing sea
Let my waves wash away thy grief
And coney thy shadowless soul back to me"

I've renounced the ways of christ
I've spat on his throne and scoffed at his lies
I'll install a new kingdom to which there will be
Everlasting indulgence for you and me

Soon we shall stroll through the spellbinding murk
My time has come to relinquish this earth
With cascading tears of horizons unseen
I'll be united with my pallid queen

Together we will drink to our undying love
Absinthe shall lift us on the wings of a dove
And transport us to places beyond our dreams
Where graceful nymphs dominate the scene

And so I forsake my ancient abode
My calamitous fable of woe unfolds
With valor I face the sweltering sun
In thy pale reflection of death
We are one...
