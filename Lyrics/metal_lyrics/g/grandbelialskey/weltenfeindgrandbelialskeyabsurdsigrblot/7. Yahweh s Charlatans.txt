The germicide almost complete
Beaks buried face first in manure
No one guards the sky from harm
I stand at the towers of oppression

Frightened by the milk
Of forbidden animals
Lives haunted by
Thoughts of impurity

Yahweh's charlatans

Fountain of child devourers
A judenblut on its head
Obeying the dictators
Of oral traditions

Criminal gatherings in secrecy
To divulge the prohibited tales
Banned cult never truly crushed

As obtuse as the flesh of mules
The germicide almost complete
The dreidel kept their cover

Intoning a prayer before the lamb
The Tabernacle prepared for the kill
Murderous ways of the interlocked triangles
Hogs of the great whore

Yahweh's charlatans

The excrement of a white dog
Kneaded with balsam
Down his chapped hatch
Is the cure for pleurisy

But beware
Of its ten plagues
If the cure, if the cure is eaten
But beware
Of its ten plagues
As obtuse as the flesh of mules

For it loosens the limbs

But beware
Of its ten plagues
If the cure, if the cure is eaten
But beware
Of its ten plagues
As obtuse as the flesh of mules

The germicide is complete
