His undignified reflection
In the pool of gore
The animal is dead
But its muscles still twitch

Substitute for a man
It bribes the heavens
A two-legged chicken
It bribes the heavens

He graps the legs of a rooster
Swung three times above his beanie
In movements unknown
An offering of dead birds

Substitute for a man
It bribes the heavens
A two-legged chicken
It bribes the heavens

Man to fowl, fowl to man
Above his mucky skullcap
In movements unknown
The rite of Kapparot

Rooster and hen, Adam and Eve
The multitude tiptoes
In the fields of guts
Blood on their feet

In movements unknown
For atonement of their cruelty
Misfortune tellers abide by tradition
Passed on from hebe to hebe

Rooster and hen, Adam and Eve
The multitude tiptoes
In the fields of guts
Blood on their feet
