Seeking to disturb celestial bodies
Bombarding satellites that depend
Upon the radiance of their star
Scorching beyond recognition

The fusion taking place between
The heart of a star goes into
Overdrive and massive energy
Is released with fatal consequences

Sabotaging
Solar systems

Enemies eradicated
Without warning
No life shall remain
There is no one mourning
Them

Sudden onslaught of heat and energy
Reaches their world
Vaporizing oceans and
Blasting the atmosphere
Into space

All lifeforms are subject to the massive destruction
Boiled or steamed alive they cannot escape their angry sun
Taking shelter only prolongs the pain that is inflicted
Twisted metal is the only sign that life ever existed

Immolation of a planet achieved without most efficiency
