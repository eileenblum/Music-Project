Presence in the atmosphere
Reaping waves of death
Frequencies shaped to punish
Infringing colonies

They came to take
Control of what's beneath
Electronic terror
Removes technology

Creeping inside

Creeping inside

Without defenses
We couldn't fight
We tried to flee
No escape in sight
Creep inside
There's no escape
Creep inside
There's no
Escape

The systems were disabled
Can't find a way to computate the
Coordinates of the breach
They're swarming in like rats
We've been fatally outmatched

EMP, EMP

They try to pacify our force
Worthless
Prepare and supply the means
To transfer
Ownership of all of this
Take urgency
Keeping nothing for yourself
Give it to me

Give in, give in
Your conquerors
Keep a ship with cloaking fields
Keep it ready
For attack

No electronic devices
You've no way to fight back
Like indigenous savages
This place is sacked

The spinning wheel
Of ascendancy
Crushed another dream
