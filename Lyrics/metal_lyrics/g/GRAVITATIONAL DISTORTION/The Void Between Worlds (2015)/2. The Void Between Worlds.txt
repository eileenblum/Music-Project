Distances between
Incomprehensible
A vast void
Of cold nothingness

We are trapped
On this lonesome rock
Desiring a new existence
A frontier amongst the stars
A place to plant the seed

There is
No way to escape
We will rot in our waste
Kings try to lead our race
Yet they are slaves
Subjected by selfish minds
There is no way

To escape
From our own gravity
Diverting our efforts
To kill our brothers
Crushed

Only one hope to survive
Escape outside
Only one hope to survive
Escape outside

Seeking a new
Place to survive
Safe from the poison
We left behind
Kept safe inside
Titanium ships

The distances between
Are massive
Centuries of space travel
Cold blackness

Dying
Generations
Replace their elders
Born in transit

Forgetting knowledge
Of where we came from

Distances between

Incomprehensible
A vast void
Of cold nothingness

Arrive on alien shores
With no wisdom or basis
Starting over
Infants of earth must try

Only one hope to survive
Escape outside
Only one hope to survive
Escape outside
