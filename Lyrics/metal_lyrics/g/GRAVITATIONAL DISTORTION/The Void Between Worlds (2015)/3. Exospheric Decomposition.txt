Premature burial
Beyond the atmosphere
Premature death
Bleeding out

Exist in the cycle of morbidly decomposed in the circle

Revolve around the planet earth
Revolve around the planet earth

Irradiate deceased flesh
Exospheric heat desiccates
Converting the corpse to a leathery husk
Erasing identity

Sterilization
The body's air
Leeching
Into outer space

Inner microorganisms
Completely erased
Decomposition
At a snail's pace
Collisions with debris
Are the only way
To provide change
To the body's state

Returning to atmosphere's range
Burning suddenly
