A sentinel
In polar orbit
Inactive and seemingly inert
Witness to all earthly creation
From the moment it crawled from the sea
With perpetual patience
It watches from its heavenly perch
Silently judging
All knowing
Its eyes focused
And searching for a reason

Black death in the sky above
A watchful eye, devoid of love
Awaits the day we escape the cage
The period at the end of a page
Black death in the sky above
A watchful eye, devoid of love
Awaits the day we escape the cage
The period at the end of a page
Merciless wraith
Scrape flesh from the planet's bones
Black death in the sky above
A watchful eye, devoid of love
The cycle has become complete
Scorch the Earth with heat

The criteria has been met
Ancient machinery is activated
Apocalypse weaponry takes aim
Targeting all evidence of civilization
Unleashing a godly fury
Total eradication
