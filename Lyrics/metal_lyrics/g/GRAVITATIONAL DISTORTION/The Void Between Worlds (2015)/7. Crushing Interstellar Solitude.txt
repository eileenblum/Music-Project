Isolation of the soul
Deprivation of the mind
Decades alone
Humanity left behind

There does not remain
My soul does not contain
A single vestige of socialization
So far out of touch
I've forgotten life
Within the earthly clutch
While hurtling through the cosmos
A seed carried by the wind

Destination purported
To promise inhabitants, environments

The ship and I are one
We dwell between the suns

What would I even say
If my passages would awake?
They lay in frozen slumber
I live only for their sake
I forget why

Inanimate useless things
Endless rows of inert stuff
Wasting ship's resources
I think we've had enough

Our progress should increase
If we shed dead weight
Divert that power to our thrust
We won't arrive late

The only thing that is certain
Is the metal beneath my feet
An extension of my body
I'll shed the spare meat

I kill the power to stasis pods
With cold certainty
Increasing the stockpile
Of available energy
We convey their melting carcasses
To the cargo bay

Destination purported
To promise inhabitants, environments
Our journey we shortened
Ejected the passengers into space
