Imploding planetary masses, natural fission reactor
Phase change energy, gravitational fields
The beast consumes within, our planet's core
Lithospheric penetration, we come to an end

Squeezing life from the planetary mass

Ancient

Creature from the depths, consumes life
Consumes the earth and it will seal our doom

Multiverse wormhole devourment, interplanetary death
Quantum entanglement, black body convulsing

Black hole absorbs

Life

Galaxies collapse in
To it's gaping black maw
Critical mass has come

Imploding planetary masses, mantle has decomposed
Phase change energy, inner core deplete
The beast consumes within, our thermal heat
Lithospheric penetration, we are deceased

Dark matter residue
