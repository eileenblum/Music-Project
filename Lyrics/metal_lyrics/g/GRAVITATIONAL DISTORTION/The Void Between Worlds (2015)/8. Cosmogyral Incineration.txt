Hurling through solar systems
Correlated for invading
Suffocating the defenceless populations
Through infinite stippling spheres

Core melts to fall within itself
Releasing results unknowing
Claiming the space of a galaxy
Simultaneous implosion of the nexus

Cremating worlds
Gyrating spheres

Unbearable rising heat
Reanimating through fire
Only to transgress below
Prepared to quantum leap
Accreting atmosphere

Glowing hot intrepid
Swirling a tide
Re-amplifies their sun to demise

Could the species ascend beyond
Could they find solace in the fire

A derivable and incognizant
Universal evolution

Sulfurs floating in the matrix
Create flammable material
Purifying elements
To photonic explosion

Infinite
Gyral incineration
Annihilation of dimensions
Forever
