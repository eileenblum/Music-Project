Now enter the hall of infinity, where is no light of day
In this darkened tomb of misery I walk through this haunting daze
I'm out of it, I'm out of it, in these eternal tears of pain
Divine intervention in this unholy land is just a life away

Left alone, in my misery
Forever forgotten, and eternally forlorn

Time after time, I just want to die
I give up all principles in order just to get high

Left alone in my misery
Walking through my mind with no sign of this world
I'm out of it and mentally deceased
Forever forgotten and eternally forlorn
