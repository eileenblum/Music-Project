Higher - I wanna be on the top of the world
Forever - I try to get higher than before
How do we find the thruth? - by searching for solitude?
We sail away from our souls - as we run away from God

In my dream
you lie next to me
You are like poison
a divine, but deadly disease 

The dragon
you are the fuel in my veins

I - I would love to hate you
but the taste of death remains so sweet
You are a deadly infection
but someone always wants a trick or treat

When the beast has been awakened - it will stay awake forever
you can't turn back the clock anymore
When it all gets too hard to handle - the dragon is there to heal
but in the end a tear will run on my cheek

In my dream
you lie next to me
You are like poison
a divine, but deadly disease

The dragon
you are the fuel in my veins
The dragon
why won't you leave my brains?
