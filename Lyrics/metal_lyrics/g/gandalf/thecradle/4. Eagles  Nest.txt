I came to see you fly
not to cry
when your dreams where crushed and despised

I'm sorry about what happened
but life must go on
the sad memories have haunted me
too long
I'm not asking for forgiveness
I just want to let you know
Don't be plagued of sadness
the pain will only grow

So set them free, before they will be
memories from the past, bringing you more misery
Set them free, before they will be
sad reminders in future never seen

Fly, like a thought in the sky
your beauty can mesmerize a mind
Fly, like a silhouette in the sky
your beauty can mesmerize eyes

So fly - away
from the eagles nest
Fly - away
from the eagles nest 

Fly, what can you do with your life
try, to fight for what is right
If you are trapped in a cell and destined to die
alone you will lose but united we stand
