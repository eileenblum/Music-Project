Higher
I wanna be on top of the world
Forever
I try to get higher than before
How do we find the truth
By searching for solitude?
We sail through the depths of our souls
As we run away from God

In my dream
You lie next to me
You are like poison
A divine but deadly disease

I - I would like to hate you
But the taste of deaths remains so sweet
You are a deadly infection
But someone always wants a trick or treat

When the beast has been awakened
It will stay awake forever
You can't turn back the clock anymore
When it all gets too hard to handle
The dragon is there to heal
But in the end a tear will run my cheek

The dragon
You are the fuel in my veins
The dragon
You don't you leave my brains
