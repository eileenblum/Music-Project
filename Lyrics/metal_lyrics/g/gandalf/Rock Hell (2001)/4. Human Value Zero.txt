Home, religion, and fatherland
Terms carved in stone, now engraved in sand
Indifference is our host
All information guiding us lost

We pay the price
If we let our minds to the blind

Please, mistress, set me free
And do your dirty deeds
Don't exhale, just suck
Screw morality and fuck
Pornographic revolution
Mandatory masturbation
Evolution of society
The decline of humanity

We pay the price
If we let our minds to the blind
We live a life
Where emotions are hard to find

Who is the master, the living disaster
Who is the lord, who'll die by the sword
Who is the king, the lord of the ring
Who is the hero, where human value is set to zero

No need for fantasies
In a virtual world
There our dreams
Become reality
We don't need emotions
Just faster processors
Our lives are complete
Without humanity
