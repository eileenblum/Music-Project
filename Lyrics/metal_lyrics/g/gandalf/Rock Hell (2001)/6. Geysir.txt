There was a time
When you were young and restless
You looked to the sky
Spreading warthm and joy
Higher and higher
Down from the ground
When you erupted
Our world turned

Then came a time
When man wanted more
You were torn apart
And crucified to your core
You breathed and lived
As the heart of the world
You cried for help
But were never heard

Geysir - show us your power and your might
Geysir - spread your wings to the starlight

You couldn't survive
All the torture and abuse
Your soul was exploited
By man with no excuse
Why do we wake up too late
To see what's happening
Why don't we even learn
What nature is teaching
