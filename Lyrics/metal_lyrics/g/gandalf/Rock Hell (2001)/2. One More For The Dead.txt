Raise the glass or raise the roof
It's all the same
I raise the chalice for all those
Who are in the grave
I wrote this song to remember
And to never forget
The ones in my heart
Who are now laid to rest

I remember all the joys we had
When you were still here
Thinking of you, my friends
Wets my eyes with tears
But I can't cry forever
'Cos life is ahead
You are always in my heart
So let me sing
One more for the dead

You were the king, you were the clown
Always there hanging around
You might be gone but your spirit lives on
And that is why I sing this song

I wish you had died in my arms
But that wasn't meant to be
I did everything I could
You meant so much to me
