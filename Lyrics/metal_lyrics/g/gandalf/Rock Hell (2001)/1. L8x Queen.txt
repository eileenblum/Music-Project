Wanna tell you a story
About this girl I knew
I became mesmerized
And got my head screwed
She's been playing with my mind
And she knows it far too well
She's my obsession
I'm a slave under her spell

'Cos what she wants she will always get

Her looks might fool you
But innocent she is not
When she struts around
Heads spin on the spot
She might play the violin
In that black latex dress
But she will never blow my horn
Or become my mistress

'Cos what she wants she will always get

She knows the game and she can play it well
How to make a man's life into a living hell
In the distance, she looks so damn fine
But I know she won't ever be mine

What there's inside
I don't want to know
I'd rather keep my dream 'cos
She might be a scarecrow
She knows how to fake herself
Into every man's dream
But reality becomes a nightmare
For the latex queen

'Cos what she wants she will always get
But what she got left her goods to rot
