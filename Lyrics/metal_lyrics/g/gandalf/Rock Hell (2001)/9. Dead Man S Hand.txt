I'm sitting at the table
With four aces and a king
I know I have hit the jackpot
And it's my turn to win
Today's been the day
I have dreamt for my whole life
I rocked hell and rolled
Three sixes with the dice

My luck has finally turned
I got what I deserved

I didn't know I was playing with a dead man's hand
And there is no escape from no-man's land

I had four aces and the king
But I forgot the joker
A bullet through the head
Wins any hand in poker

I didn't know I was playing with a dead man's hand
And there is no escape from no-man's land
I made a pact with the devil for gold and glory
And that was the end of my life and my story

Bet, hold,
Raise, fold
Win, fall
Call

I wanted to live in luxury and never go bust
But as I died my gold was equal to rust
