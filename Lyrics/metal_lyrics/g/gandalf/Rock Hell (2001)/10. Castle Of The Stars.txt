I have never been able to move mountains
I have never been able to sing nice
I could not even draw a picture
I failed in everything I tried

I was shattered before I met you
You took my hand and made me whole
I'm sorry there's not much I can give
Except this song, my heart, and my soul

Look at the stars
And what they could tell you
Look at the sky
And try to imagine how high we could fly

I won't ever get invited
To the temple of the king
I'm poor so there isn't much I can give you
Except my dream, a prayer, and a wing
