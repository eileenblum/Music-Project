Good morning, Sun
How do you feel today?
Lead us with your light
When we are astray

We will lose, we all will die
The countdown has begun
But as long as I live
I will enjoy the morning sun

My morning sun
Tell us when the darkness descends
Or when our almighty quest will end
So we can prepare us for the worst
And find salvation before the outburst

Good evening, Sun
How was your day?
As your curtains have fallen
Wake those who lie
