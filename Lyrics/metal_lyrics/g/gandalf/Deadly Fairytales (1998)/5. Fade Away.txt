Now the ghouls are back on the streets, 
Capturing new victims and starting to feast, 
The lost souls haunted eyes show shame and guilt, 
Soon fresh blood is set to spill, 
Dressed in disguise, 
They offer their friendship and trust, 
But what they really want, 
Is to suck you dry in lust, 
Have your spirits, 
Disappearing in vain, 
Your shadow fading away, 
In emotional pain, 
Your heart is being torn apart, 
When you try to dig yourself, 
Out of the dark, 
You fear of losing your rests in pain, 
But take a chance to see what you have to gain, 
Don't think that this is your destiny, 
Living under the spell of a charming enemy, 
You fear of losing your rests in pain, 
But take a chance to see what you have to gain, 
Don't let your mind make you a shadow, 
To have your heart and soul - fade away.
