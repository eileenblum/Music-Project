Convulsions, silent tongue
I ask you not to speak
Tomorrow I will learn
erase my memories

Past, darkness rose
Crying tears within
Happiness, lost emotion
Pain, no more

Dark... Old... Memories

Behind minds curtain
Blind eyes can see
Secrets of what I've done
Captured to remain

Controlled stupidity
Violence achieved
Crimes against humanity
Soulless again

Ignorance, the biggest reason
you don't understand
Ribald, language spoken
Dreaming of blood
