I rule my world, 
I am immortal, 
I'll show you where, 
The light is to be found, 
It gave me life, 
I never thought existed, 
A greater ride, 
Than ever before, 
Who needs a god?, 
If you are in seventh heaven, 
Who needs a goat?, 
If it only speaks for the dead, 
I am alive and in, 
Fire - keeps me vivid in flames, 
Fire - and I'll make you feel the same, 
I'm free at last, 
From the ties of this world, 
Just follow your soul, 
And it can be eternally yours, 
Just one life, 
Before you die, 
Become your master, 
Before it's too late.
