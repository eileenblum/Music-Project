Isolated from this world, 
As the deed is done, 
No turning back, 
Now my days are gone, 
Hiding away, 
From my future, 
But I can't hide, 
From my conscience, 
I'm breathing but dead, 
Imprisoned inside my head, 
Darkness, 
Never free again, 
Light, 
Never to see again, 
All is lost, 
No hope for me, 
But for what I did, 
This is the price to be.
