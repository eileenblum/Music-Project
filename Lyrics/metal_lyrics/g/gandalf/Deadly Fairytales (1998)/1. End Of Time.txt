My future is somber, 
And so are my eyes, 
When the lights turn on, 
This marks the end of time, 
The choice of a new generation, 
Is choking in my mind, 
But something new borns, 
When something old dies, 
Day by day I search, 
For the absolute truth, 
The knowledge of mankind, 
To become an oracle from a fool, 
Days turning to weeks, 
Weeks turning to months, 
Changing colours from an underdog, 
Into a god, 
Unchain yourself from the temporal power, 
And you will finally be free, 
My future was somber, 
And so were my eyes, 
But when the lights turned on, 
It marked the start of a new life, 
The lust for a new generation, 
Is filling my mind, 
Something new borns, 
When something old dies, 
Unchain yourself from the temporal power, 
And you will finally be free, 
Free from your mental slavery, 
From serving time, 
To have all the time you need.
