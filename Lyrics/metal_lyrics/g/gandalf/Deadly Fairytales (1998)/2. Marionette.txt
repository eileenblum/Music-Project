A vision of mortality - all spirits reign supreme
Watched and controlled - these emotions are crucifying me

Who can you trust
when you are lost
Who'll show the way
when you're astray
Who tells the truth
to the world and the youth
Don't need an answer to this
'cos I'm in a sacred bliss

When you're a marionette
locked by your lost emotions, dancing to images of clowns
When you're a puppet
looking through the eyes of the dead, on your lost, burning soul

Who is the fool
is it me or you
Do you know the way
when you are astray
try to find out
what life is about
Don't hesitate
before it's too late

You hail to the king
you know that he will win
But in the mirror you see
a puppet with a face of grief
