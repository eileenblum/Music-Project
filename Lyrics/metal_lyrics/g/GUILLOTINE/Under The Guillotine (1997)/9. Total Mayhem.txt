Nuclear attack, 2001, total disaster
Atomic bomb, will hit the ground
No life after
Innocent death, is what they get
This ain't no game
Horrible screams is what you hear
Screaming your name

If you will live or if you die
It makes no difference to me
I'll push the botton that takes your life
Why can't you see

Total mayhem

Second attack, 3006
Earth is destroyed
Polluted air, chemical waste
Toxic android
Innocent death is what they got
This ain't no game
Horrible screams is what you heard
Screaming your name

If you will live or if you die
It makes no difference to me
I'll push the button that takes your life
Why can't you see

Total mayhem

Nuclear death, radioactive
End of life, devastation
