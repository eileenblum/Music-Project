All dressed in black, I'm searching for victims
Don't follow my track
To look for my pray, I lurk in the shadows
To torture and slay
Lonely at night, calling for Satan
To help spread the fright
Locking you doors, locking your windows
I feel no remorse

I feel the pleasure, to see all that blood
I like to torture, and rape in the night
I kill for Satan, the Antichrist
I paint the sign, lead me to hell

Night stalker

I enter your home, moving so silent
In darkness I roam
You cannot see me, I hide in the dark
I feel so free
I'm moving in, you are still sleeping
I'm ready for sin
I raise my knife, then you wake up
I take your life!!!

I feel the pleasure, to see all that blood
I like to torture, and rape in the night
I kill for Satan, the Antichrist
I paint the sign, lead me to hell

Night stalker

You think I'm crazy - You don't know Satan
I am in deathrow - I am night stalker

I feel the pleasure, to see all that blood
I like to torture, and rape in the night
I kill for Satan, the Antichrist
I paint the sign, lead me to hell

Night stalker!!!
