The smell of death in the air
Slaughtered bodies lies everywhere
Heads are cut off, all our hope is lost
A human life is what it costs

Death penalty

The dying victims bleed to death
Soon they'll breathe their final breath
Hear their cries. They slowly fade away
In this world Ill never stay

Death penalty

Is this a nightmare? You will never know
Do you understand now how it feels to die?

Death penalty
