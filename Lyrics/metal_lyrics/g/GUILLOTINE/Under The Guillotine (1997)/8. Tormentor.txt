In the darkest night, he'll come for you
He hunts and rapes, to praise the one
Torment and pain, eater of the dead
Searching for blood, you can't escape

He'll take your life, he'll kill you now

Beaware the tormentor, tormentor

He took your soul, you saw the light
You can't run no more, can you face the fear
Nightmares and screams, slaughter of the soul
Laying in a coffin, you start to rot

You met the tormentor, tormentor

You saw a flashing light, that brings you back to life
You are the living dead, you cry out your call
Never to die again, you are the new tormentor

In the darkest night, he'll come for you
He hunts and rapes, to praise the one
Tormentor and pain, eater of the dead
Searching for blood, you can't escape

He'll take your life, he'll kill for now

Beware the tormentor, tormentor
