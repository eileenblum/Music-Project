Your eyes burnt with fear, you started to run
But you can't escape
From the nightmare he brings you
The reaper itself will hunt you down
And when he's got you he'll break your bones

The priest will die tonight, the reaper tracks you down
Followed the trace from your blood
You will for sure die in a guillotine

Time to pay for your sins, now you die - guillotine
Time to pray to your god, no escape

He'll pull your head down in under the blade
There's no way out, he'll piss on your grave
The reaper has now realeased the blade
We can only hear him laugh as you die

The priest will die tonight, the reaper tracks you down
Followed the trace from your blood
You will for sure die in a guillotine

Time to pay for your sins, now you die - guillotine
Time to pray to your god, no escape, no escape
