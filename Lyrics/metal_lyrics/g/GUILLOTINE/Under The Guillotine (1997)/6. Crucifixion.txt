Some hundred years ago, vigilantes ruled in town
They set the laws around, none could hunt them down
They were the sons of dark, children of the master
They're on the hunt again, towards disaster

They kill for the ruler
He has the command
Over the people
Now he will return

Crucifixion

Now the time has come, to hear the call
The words of darkness, Christians will fall
We will nail them to the cross, die in the sun
Hang them up high, 'til there's nowhere to run

They kill for the ruler
He has the command
Over the people
Now he will return

Crucifixion

You will sure die tonight!
