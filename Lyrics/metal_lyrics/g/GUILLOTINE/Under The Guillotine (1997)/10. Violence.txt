Kids are running wild
In the streets of the city
Blood is in the gutter
The riot has begun
There are many gangs around
They fight with knifes and bats
Who will win and who will lose?
No one can tell

Fight â for your life
Scream â out your hate
Kill â or be killed
Pull out your knifes

Violence!

A man is lying bleeding
No one seems to care
Everyone is fighting
Fighting for the lives
Sirens in the night
Police side by side
The crowd is spilling up
Running for the sense

Fight â for your life
Scream â out your hate
Kill â or be killed
Pull out your knifes

Violence!
