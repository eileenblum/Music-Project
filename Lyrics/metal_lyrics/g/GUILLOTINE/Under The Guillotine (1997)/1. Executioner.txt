The Fire is burning in his eyes
They say hes crazy, but that's just a lie
He doesn't care if you live or die
He likes to torture, He laughs when you cry

He, is the Executioner!!!
He will soon take your life
He, is the Executioner!!!
So now prepare to die

A crowd is gathered to witness the death
There is no tomorrow, so take your last breath
Its too late to scream and too late to cry
The time has come soon you will die!!!

He is the Executioner
he will soon take your life
He is the Executioner
So now prepare to die
