A terrible disease spreads across the lands
The people are dying, there's chance to survive
Your body soon to change, there's no hope to cure
It will take control, and bring you to your death

You can't run and you can't hide
It's horrible
Pain will come and soon you'll die
By leprosy

You can hear the screams, and you can feel the fear
Dead bodies on the ground, death will come slow
All you see is horror, a life so obscure
You don't know if you are dead or alive

[Chorus]

Devastation everywhere
It's no need to fear
Black death on it's way
No matter what you say

[Chorus]

DIE!!! DIE!!! DIE!!! By leprosy!!!
