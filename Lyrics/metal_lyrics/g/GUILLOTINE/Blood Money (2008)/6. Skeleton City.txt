Get up and all is chaos, I should have stayed in bed
Another bloody Monday's here, a full week o playing dead
Hey you, a name &amp; number? Headcount is on the way
Report in to assembly line, you're stuck till your dying day

Consume, produce you loser, who cares if no one'd use it
No hope, dead machines alive
No one is necessary, you' all secondary now

In skeleton city, in skeleton city
Just another day, in skeleton city

Come here, I've got your money, and money it makes me king
Crawl on your knees and take the whip, to me you're not a thing
Hey son, you best obey me, this bullet is just for you
I keep it in my wad of cash
So do what I say, you fool!

[Lead: Daniel]

In skeleton city, in skeleton city
Just another day, in skeleton city
Skeleton city
Downhill all the way, in skeleton city
