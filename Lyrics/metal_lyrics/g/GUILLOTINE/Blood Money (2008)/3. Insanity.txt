You are killing yourselves, only wasting away
Better who you know than who you are
The time that you spend, on the gods you create
Oblivious to nothing but your part

[Lead: Daniel]

Welcome my friends, to the world that you made
Marching like you dream, just down the drain
You are rather in line, like the fools on parade
Hope you're lucky on you planet hate

All this agony, my insanity
You are what is wrong with me
What humanity, only vanity
You are my insanity

So a cynic I am, not playing the game
Indifferent is all I'll ever be
Tell my friend, Mr. Rat in a cage
Who really is the one who's on a leash?

[Lead: Daniel]
