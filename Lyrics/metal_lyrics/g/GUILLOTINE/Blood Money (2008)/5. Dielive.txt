You are monstrosity, I'm a filthy suine
Two stand-up lying sacks of shit
You bring atrocity, the end of the line
We go in league into the pit

I hear this voice...

Do you wanna die? Do you wanna live?
Do you wanna waste another day, another second of life?
Do you wanna die? Do you wanna live?
Are you gonna piece it back again, this stinkin' joke you call life?

This joke you call life

You're sobriety, self-righteous fool
Who cannot practise what you preach
You're high society, you apply the rules
To me a drunken wannabe

I hear this voice...

Do you wanna die? Do you wanna live?
Do you wanna waste another day, another second of life?
Do you wanna die? Do you wanna live?
Are you gonna piece it back again, this stinkin' joke you call life?

You parasite, you dry me out
Live or die, who gives a damn
Your dirty claws in me, oh will I ever see
My head is in your guillotine
