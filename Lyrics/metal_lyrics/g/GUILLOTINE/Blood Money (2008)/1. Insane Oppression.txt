Right wing assassins controlling our lives
Make us live in misery and hell

Conservative illusions make it all "democracy"
To main and slay for everything that sells
Trading embargoes, corruption and greed
Protectionism is the modern way
Demoralize your citizen's, control society
Kill the fuckers who won't get in line, today!

Now it's time
It's to say good-bye to Mother Earth

Insane oppression
Makes for aggression
Insane oppression
The end has just begun

Look at the "freedom", controlling our news
Politics and empty barricades
Disinform your people and then write them off as fools
They'll swallow everything you have to say
Choke on your money, you blood soaked bill
Trading arms with our "enemies"!
Make a buck on terror, while you're sleeping with the beast
You decide the headlines for the news, machine!

Now it's time
It's to say hello to tragedy

Insane oppression
Makes for aggression
Insane oppression
The end has just begun

[Lead: Fredrik]

Insane oppression
Makes for aggression
Insane oppression
Go get yourself a gun!

Insane, insane oppression!
