I define your enemy, a bastard of today
A nature's true obscenity, your failure on display
A vermin of society, a thinking whore alive
The sand in your machinery, the red inside your eyes

I, fan the flame, go against the grain
Rebellion!

So if I die, resuscitate me
They'll suck me dry
Rebellion equals death!

I'm your anti-remedy, the bullet in your head
Dead eyes seen what I see, hurry shoot me dead
I'm system's own deformity, a mishap in your scheme
A foul non conformity, destroyer of your dreams

I, I am the shame, the one without a name
Rebellion!

So if I die, resuscitate me
They'll suck me dry
Rebellion equals death!
Retaliate me
I am insane
Rebellion is my name
