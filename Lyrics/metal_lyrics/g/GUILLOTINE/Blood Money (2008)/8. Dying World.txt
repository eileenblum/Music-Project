Can't see the consequence, the world turns into ice
No reason to pretend, its now, we die
So hard to comprehend, we're hanging by a thread
Humanity has failed, we're dead

Lost forever, here we are
It's sickening to see
Thought that never, it's go this far
So future here you go - here's your dying world

None left to sacrifice, we've sucked our planet dry
Just simple ignorance, you ask, the lie
Who cares about the world, exploit it til it's lost
Who ever stopped to think - our cost

Eliminate, our legacy
Free to desecrate
