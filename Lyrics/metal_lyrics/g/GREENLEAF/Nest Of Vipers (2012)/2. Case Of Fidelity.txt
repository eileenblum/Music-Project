In the case of fidelity 
How would you react
It will never be the same
Just face it, it's a fact

You need a ride back home
I lost the way somewhere, I roam

Without you there's no home
Please take me back to where I 
belong

We heard the chase is thing
We got no clue how to change
I sit alone in my house
I will always regret
the years has past me by
My mind will never, never forget

You need a ride back home
I lost the way somewhere, I roam

Without you there's no home
Please take me back to where I 
belong

We chase the rabbit on
a track that calls life
try to get to a point where we...
find a home and a nice wife

When we finally find that place 
stupidity in your face

We chase the rabbit on
a track that calls life
try to get to a point where we...
find a home and a pretty nice wife

When we finally find that place 
stupidity in your face

The black deamon, 
is coming
eat you alive, 
try to fight your way out
from the
hopeless case

The hopeless case of fidelity

When we finally find that place 

stupidity in your face

stupidity in your face

stupidity in your face
