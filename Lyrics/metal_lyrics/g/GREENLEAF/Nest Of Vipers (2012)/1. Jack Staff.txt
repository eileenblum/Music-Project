He was the kind of guy
who worked in the shadows of the night
Not as strong as superman
he did some actions and took the fight

He believed in the good of man
The staff in his hand he had a plan
to fight the world as it turns black
never thought he would go back

Even if the heroes live
Like no one else could imagine
in the end their motor gives
up if the fuel is gone

He believed in the good of man
The staff in his hand he had a plan
to fight the world as it turns black
never thought he would go back

He believed in the good of man
The staff in his hand he had a plan
to fight the world as it turns black
never thought he would go
Never thought he would go
Never thought he would go
Never thought he would go back....
Fight the world
Before it goes black
