Drops of blood run down my chin.
I feel so hollow deep within.
I hope I'll never cross your path again.
'Cause you made me feel it, and I always believed it.

I'm strapped and tied on island shores
Without no comfort, out of cure.
You really had to fool me in the end.
'Cause you made me feel it, and I always believed it.

Mind your walk.
I will follow your steps.
Your trails and passes.
Can you scent my breath?

I made a vow towards myself.
I'll catch you falling in the bend.
No sudden turns will benefit your run.
'Cause you made me feel it, but I'll never believe it.

Stand steady for the final call.

You'll hear it echo more and more.
A sudden distant comfort for you now.
'Cause you made me feel it, but I'll never believe it.

Mind your walk.
I will follow your steps.
Your trails and passes.
Can you scent my breath?

Mind your walk.
I will follow your steps.
Your trails and passes.
Can you scent my breath?

Mind your walk.
I will follow your steps.
Your trails and passes.
Can you scent my breath?
