Caught in shadow
Hidden low away from the sun
In the silence
Where the safety is found

Beneath the stones,
Within the soil,
In the warmth of the ground
They rest their weary heads
From dust until dawn

But as the day breaks,
She climbs upstairs
Though the fear surrounds
The taste of the air

And sudden shapes just
Quickly appear
On the northern hill
Not far from here

And all those greedy eyes
And all their eager sighs
As all their howls raised her scare
Setting off
No time to spare
Her sentence was clear
As all their eyes of lust
That held her so dear

Oh, you hear them howl
As they come through the woods

Muddy trails and rugged trees and the light in her eyes
She slowly ran along as fast as she could
Beyond the rural safety just too old to supply
She just ran and ran as fast as she could

And all those greedy eyes
And all their eager sighs
As all their howls raised her scare
Setting off
No time to spare
Her sentence was clear
As all their eyes of lust
That held her so dear

Oh, you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
They closing in on your path
They are drawn to your blood

Crimson patterns resurrected
On that torn old wooden floor
She gets forced my their hatred
Deep in behind those well-locked doors

And they'll howl, howl
Yes, they'll howl, howl

Jaws are fighting for that pleasure
Dark breath so far from grace
Until all of her is wasted
Crooked, silent there she lay

And they'll howl, howl
Yes, they'll howl, howl, howl

Oh, you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
They closing in on your path
They are drawn to your blood
