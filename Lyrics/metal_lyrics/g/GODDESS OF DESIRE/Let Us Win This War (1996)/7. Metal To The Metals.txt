METAL TO THE METALS ONLY THE TRUE WILL STAY
SPIKES STUDS &amp; LEATHER SATAN TO THOU WE PRAY
METAL TO THE METALS POSERS AND WIMPS GET OUT
METAL TO THE METALS WE JUST WANT A PURE CROWD
LIVE FOR THE MUSIC THAT'S LOUDER THAN HELL
IT PULLS YOU OVER THE TOP

METAL TO THE METALS A HEATED BANGING CROWD
FISTS IN THE AIR, HEAR SWEEPING ALL AROUND
METAL TO THE METALS THE VIBE GOES ALL AROUND
CAN NOT STAND STILL CAUGHT BY THIS LOUD
POUNDING SOUND

LIVE FOR THE MUSIC THAT'S LOUDER THAN HELL
OVER THE TOP YOU'RE UNDER THE SPELL

LOUD AS YOU CAN YOU'RE INTO HEAVY METAL

METAL TO THE METALS ONLY THE TRUE WILL STAY
SPIKES STUDS &amp; LEATHER SATAN TO THOU WE PRAY
METAL TO THE METALS POSERS AND WIMPS GET OUT
