LOVING LIPS WERE MOVING LIKE TASTING TANGERINE
PARADOX OF BEAUTINESS DEAD LIKE A COLD MACHINE
LIGHT ABSORBING HAIR RAVEN BLACK LIKE HELL
FEMALE DARKNESS EVIL FORCES NOW IN HER DWELL
MASSES SENSUALITY IN THE RHYTHM OF HER BREATH
ETERNAL SLAVES OF PASSION FOLLOW HER INTO DEATH
ADDICTED TO HER VICE PEARLING LIKE BLOOD-RED DAWN
CAPTIVE OF HER THRALLDOM SINCE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN

[CHORUS:]
UNDER THE BLIND EYES OF FAITH
SHE POISONED MY CONVULSIVE BREATH
CYANIDED BY HER VIPER-TONGUE
I MAKE THIS LOVE TO MY DEATH

LEAD YOUR LEWDY TONGUE ACROSS THE GOBLET'S BRIM
TO PENETRATE HER DARK SECRET EXISTANCE LYING IN
THIS LOATHING CONDENCE BY WHICH SHE MAKES HER LOVERS DRUNK
SO DRINK AND NEVER RETURN FROM THE DELIRIUM OF PAIN
KING BEYOND THE THRESHOLD OF HER REIGN

[LEAD:]

MISTRESS OF INFERNO NO WAY TO TURN HER ON
SHE'S A DAUGHTER OF ALL EVIL SUPREME CARRION
YOU HAVE DEGRADED YOURSELF BY ACTING AS HER SLAVE
ALL YOUR LIFE AND NOW SHE'S SHITTING ON YOUR GRAVE!

[CHORUS:]
