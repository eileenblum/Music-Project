THE BATTLEGROUND
COVERED WITH BLOOD AND CORPSES
WE FOUGHT HARD
WITH SWORDS FIRE AND AXES
WE WON THE BATTLE
WE ALWAYS WILL PREVAIL
WE'LL CRUSH OUR ENEMIES
AND SATAN OUR MASTER WE HAIL
AT THE BATTLEGROUND
BLOOD'S TO BE FOUND
TRY NOT TO HIDE
YOU'LL SOON DIE

WE RAPE THE WOMEN KILL THE CHILDREN
ENSLAVE ALL THE MEN
BURN THEIR CHURCHES TAKE THEIR GOLD
DESTROY ALL WE CAN
IF WE FIND ANY PRIESTS WE SACRIFICE THEM TO THE BEAST
WE'LL STRIP THEIR FLESH AND EAT IT
WHAT A FEAST

AT THE BATTLEGROUND
BLOOD'S TO BE FOUND
IN THE FIRE
YOU'LL SOON FRY
