BEFORE THE WALL OF NOISE WE'LL GATHER
TO GRIND OUR FUCKING STRINGS TO CLATTER
CAUSE HARMONIC DEATH'S THE ONLY MATTER
BEHIND THIS WALL OF TERROR FOREVER
NO BREAK OR MELODY NOR TONE
ONLY A DEATH-CRUSH TO THE BONE
NOW WE EXCEEDED VELOCITIES UNKNOWN
IN PANDEMONIUM POWER OVERTHROWN

WEAVE THE IMMACULATE CORDS AVERSE
ON HELL'S EVIL GLAMOUROUS LOOM
RED HOT FIRE AND FLAMES EMERGE
TO CRACKLE THIS MONSTRIOUS TUNE

RELENTLESS WE CONTINUE THE POUND
ON A NERVE-MUTILATING SOUND
IN FRONT OF BLEEDING CORPSES ON THE GROUND
BY OUR MARSHALL WALL OF TERROR DROWNED

WALL OF TERROR!
ARMAGEDDON!
BLEED FOREVER!
ALL TOGETHER!
