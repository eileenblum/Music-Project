BY THE DEVIL I'M POSSESSED
MY LOYALTY TO HIM SHALL LAST
AT THE STRIKE OF TWELVE I'LL RISE
MY SWORD IN HAND TO AGONIZE
TO RAPE IN WRATH ALL I SEE
TILL CRUEL DEATH'S MY FINAL PLEA
DEMON FIGHT NEAR ME TONIGHT
SATAN KILL TO BRING DELIGHT

[CHORUS:]
I SODOMIZE MY STEAL
UNHOLY CIRCUMCISION
SATAN'S WRATH THEY FEEL
DIABOLIC DEMOLITION

UNCLIT ALL HOLY CONCUBINES
STARTING MARY SLUT DEVINE
CATHEDRALS RUMBLE TOTAL LOSS
MASSAGE MY GUTS WITH HOLY CROSS

[CHORUS:]

THE WORDS INRI I CHANGED TO SHIT
I HAD TO LAUGH I MUST ADMIT
IN THE NAME OF SATAN'S MOUTH
I BOOZE MY VENOM DO IT LOUD

FOR I'M COMING YEAH
THE TIME IS THERE
THE SEEDS OF HATE
THE HEAVEN'S SHARE
