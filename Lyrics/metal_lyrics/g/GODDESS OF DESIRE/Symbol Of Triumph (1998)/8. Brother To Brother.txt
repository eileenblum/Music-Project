LET US REIGN TOGETHER PROUDLY STANDING TALL
WE SERVE A GREATER PURPOSE SO WE'LL NEVER FALL
WE DEFEND OUR CASTLE SHOOT HEADS OVER THE WALL
WHIMPS TRY TO GET NEARER WE LAUGH AT THEIR CALLS
[CHORUS:]
BROTHER TO BROTHER YOURS IN LIFE AN DEATH
BE TRUE TO ONE OTHER EVEN IF IT MEANS YOUR HEAD

SWEAR THE HOLY OATH LET THE SPIRIT CARRY ON
THE LEGION OF THE GOAT FROM THE FATHER TO THE SON
NO FEAR OF THE SWORD PROUD TO BE IN LINE
WE ONLY HAVE ONE LORD WE'RE WAITING FOR THE SIGN

[CHORUS:]

I WILL WATCH YOUR BACK IF YOU WILL WATCH MINE
WE WILL FACE THE WAR TILL THE END OF TIME
AND IF WE WOULD DIE OUR FRIENDS WOULD BE PROUD
WE WILL WATCH UPON THEM FROM VALHALLA'S CLOUD

[CHORUS:]

AND IF I WOULD DIE THE WAR WOULD NOT BE LOST
I DID SERVE MY TIME BUT IT WAS FOR A CAUSE
WE WILL STICK TOGETHER, EVEN IN LIFE BEYOND
SO LET US GO TO WAR WE WILL STAND IN FRONT

[CHORUS:]
