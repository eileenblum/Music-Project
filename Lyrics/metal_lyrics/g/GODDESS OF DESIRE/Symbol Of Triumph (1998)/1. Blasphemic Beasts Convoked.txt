PUTRID IS MY JACKED THE WARPAINT'S ON MY FACE
SATAN'S CROSS AROUND MY NECK WEAR STUDS ON METAL BLADES
A BULLET-BELT DIAGONAL AND TWO AROUND MY HIP
A SKULL ROBBED FROM A BURIAL HANGS RIGHT BEFORE MY DICK
LIKE TOTAL DEATH I LOOK MY ORNAMENT'S COMPLETE
AT LAST I'M FIT TO MAKE THE CHRISTIAN ASS-HOLES BLEED
[CHORUS:]
RIGHT BEFORE A CHAPEL I FIRSTLY SPEAK MY CURSE
THE TARGETS ON THE ICONS TO QUENCH MY VANDAL-THIRST
I MOCK YOU CHRISTIAN LORD IN INCENCE YOU WILL CHOKE
NOW PENTAGRAMS THREW FORTH BLASPHEMIC BEASTS CONVOKED

I VENOM THE SACRED COOKIES AND BURN THE RELICS SWEET
IMPALE THE PASTOR'S GROUPIES AND CHEW THEIR HORNY MEAT
I PUKE MY HELLISH SLIME ON THEIR DEVOTED MOUTH
WHILE PISSED BY BLOOD I CRY MY BLASPHEMY ALOUD
INVOKE MAYHEMMIC LUST RESWEAR YOUR EVIL OATH
DO CARVE A NUN'S BREAST AND SUCK THE BLOOD WITH SLOWTH

[CHORUS:]

[LEAD:]

WE'LL BATTLE SIDE BY SIDE WITH OUR INFERNAL LORD
WHEN ARMAGEDDON STRIKES TO RIP YOUR BLESSED APART
A REIGN OF TOTAL DARKNESS WHERE WE DEFEATED GOD
AROUND HIS MOULDING CARCASS A SPIDER WEAVES HIS COB
SWALLOW TORMENT SWEET BLOOD-VOMIT BY THE SWORD
AND IN THESE THROES YOU'LL MEET CLAIM SATAN AS YOUR LORD

[CHORUS:]
