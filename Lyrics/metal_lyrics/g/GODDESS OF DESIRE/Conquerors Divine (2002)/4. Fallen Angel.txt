[Chorus:]
Under attack of a fallen angel
Turns out I'm the only one standing here
Under attack of a fallen angel
Everyone's gone it's just me and my fear

Yesterday it happened again
I had to run away
From the monsters in my dreams
Scared of the dark in which I had to stay
First it seemed that I was winning
Then it turned out it was just the beginning
I lost my strength I started to scream
Hoped it would be just another bad dream

[Chorus]

I turned out to be the only one
My so called friends were already gone
What I thought real friendship was
Seemed to be nothing when all hope was lost

[Lead: Arydon]

In this final fight I am alone
Scared like Hell no place to call my own
Let me run away out of this place
Defence is breaking it's such a disgrace
Have I been so blind that I couldn't see
They have never been real friends for me
So alone and scared is how I will die

[Chorus]
