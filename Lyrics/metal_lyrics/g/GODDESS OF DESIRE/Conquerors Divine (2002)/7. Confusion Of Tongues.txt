Once upon a time men stood as one
Feeling themselves so exalted in power
They tried to defy the heaven by
Building this exceeding tower
Haughtiness of stone constructed in sin
Founded on the zenith of Hell
Where God beheld his evil creation
The downfall now became inevitable

[Chorus:]
Confusion Of Tongues
Confusion Of Tongues

All communication suddenly broke down
And alienated lips where moving independent
Ears totally deaf for possible receptors
All due to discord God has sent
So they went into the immense wide world
Far away from the place of calamity
Because there they'd only find guilt
And the memory of God's penalty

[Chorus]

[Lead: Drake]

Confusion Confusion Confusion Confusion
Confusion Confusion Confusion Of Tongues

Confusion Confusion Confusion Confusion
Confusion Confusion Confusion Of Tongues

After millennia they meet again
Contacts of violence the purest genocide
They denied the union of their ancestors
Blinded by their own racial pride
See them now the children of God
Washing away their brotherhood of blood
As followers of almighty Lord Satan
All mortal was smashed and downthrodden in mud

[Chorus]
