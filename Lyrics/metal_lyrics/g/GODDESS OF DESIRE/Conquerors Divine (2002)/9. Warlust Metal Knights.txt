In the beginning of the world
The was only rage
Then the Gods of hunder
Started the Metal-age
They created man
The way that he should be
Wild long hair and spikes
The way that he felt free

[Chorus 1:]
To the war they ride
Not feeling any fear
Giving up their lives
The grim reaper is near

Soon they multiplied
And became a lot
They had to find a name
They became the warriors of blood
Building their castles
Fighting dragons with steel
And when they came at home
They had their wives to kneel

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Warlust Metal Knights
Fighting for blood
Endless wars they fight
In the name of their Gods

[Lead: Drake]
[Lead: Arydon]

See the warriors of blood
Fighting with their swords
Loving Heavy Metal
Being true to their lords
Brothers in battle
Killing on command
No more than the others
As equal warriors they stand

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

Warlust Metal Knights!
