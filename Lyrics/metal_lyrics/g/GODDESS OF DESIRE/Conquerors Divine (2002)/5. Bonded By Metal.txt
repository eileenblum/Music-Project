you told me you wouldn't shave your head
and listen to trendy shit instead
you told me that you would wear spikes
and that you'd never buy a pair of Nike's

you told me you would be my friend
and that you'd like to see a metal band
you told me you wouldn't wear a suit
yes, for metal you were always in the mood

[Chorus:]
for we are metal eternally
bonded by blood we will be
together we stand side by side
we wear our studs &amp; spikes with pride

you stopped banging your metal head now
and you are dating a stupid fat cow
she made you cut off your hair
this is something i can't bear

so it's clear that I'll loose a friend
this is where our friendship ends
now i have to fight alone
while you watch your TV at home

[Chorus]

can you walk our just like that?
is friendship that easy to forget?
for me, this was always real
it's in my heart, it's what i feel

get out of my sight and make it fast
cause this friendship will not last
if that's the way you will betray
there is nothing more i have to say

[Chorus]
