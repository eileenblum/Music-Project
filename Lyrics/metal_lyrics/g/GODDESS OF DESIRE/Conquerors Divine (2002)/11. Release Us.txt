Asmodeus and Astaroth
Lucifer and Samael
Euronymus Baphomet
Belphegor and Azazel

Gather patrons of darkness
Inversely crucified
Guide us against the enemy
Horrendously bestified

[Chorus:]
Oh Satan lead your legions
For darkness gave us wrath
Let total mayhem feed us
Oh filthy demon laugh

Asmodeus and Astaroth
Lucifer and Samael
Euronymus Baphomet
Belphegor and Azazel

Answer dark prayers
Screaming for mayhem
For thy sign we wait
Destroy the Christian faith

[Chorus]

[Lead: Drake]

Release us from the gates
Riding Hades's ugly beast
Spread different kinds of hate
At this Hellish feast

Morbid souls will yearn
To the deathscythe's menace
See the sancted burn
In Heaven's crumbled palace

[Chorus]

[Lead: Drake]
