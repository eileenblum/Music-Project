These are the rites of war
And this is our strength
You can hear the Wargods roar
For these rites we stand

So now it's time to march
To break through the wall
Our machinery is ready
We will make them crawl

Boltthrowers pulled forward
They'll shoot the fireballs
Right over the defences
Right over their walls

[Chorus:]
These are the rites of war
And this is our strength
You can hear the Wargods roar
For these rites we stand

Battering-ram's ready
Aiming at their gates
Call the God for help now
We trust upon our faith

[Chorus]

[Lead: Grev Drake]

Now they are surrounded
Armies on each side
Captured in their castle
They're too scared to fight

So now it's time to march
We will conquer new land
To expand our kingdom
To destroy their clan

[Chorus]
