Somewhere of the fields of flowers
Resting remains of the brave and strong
Out there! From death, I rose
Kept my spirit going on.

In sallow-grey and ashen hues
I was disrobed of my warming flesh
My precious bones lay scattered
On a place on Earth named HELL!

Reach for this moment of fame
We'll feel like brothers again
Before we vanish to haze
We will be reborn!

March into the sun
Into the crimson shades of glory
Strike back we'll soon be done
When our hearts are free again!

How can I rouse my sinkin soul
From such a lethargy?
How can I break these iron chains
And set my spirit free?

My sins increase - my love grows cold
And hope within me dies:
Memories of the fallen ones
Oh, when shall we arise?

Reach for this moment of fame
We'll feel like brothers again
Before we vanish to haze
We will be reboooooooorn!

March into the sun
Into the crimson shades of glory
Strike back we'll soon be done
When our hearts are free again!

Crimson shades of glory
Crimson shades of glory

March into the sun
Into the crimson shades of glory
Strike back we'll soon be done
When our hearts are free again!
