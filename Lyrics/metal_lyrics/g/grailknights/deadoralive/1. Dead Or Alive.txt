Creatures of the night
Devour the steaming light
Servants you shall be

For now and evermore

Run, maggots run
Manhunt has begun
Heads on the plate
Before it is too late

Bring them now either dead or alive
Drag them here, either dead or alive

Dead or alive
You were doomed you were damned either
Dead or alive
No escape your fate's sealed either
Dead or alive
You were doomed you were damned either
Dead or alive
No escape your fate's sealed either

Panic in your eyes
As you face your own demise
A shot cuts up the night
To stop your reining light

Run cowards run
The downfall has begun
Heads on the plate
Before it is too late

Being them now either dead or alive
Drag them here here either dead or alive

Dead or alive
You were doomed you were damned either
Dead or alive
No escape your fate's sealed either
Dead or alive
You were doomed you were damned either
Dead or alive
No escape your fate's sealed either
Dead or alive
Dead or alive

Flee my friends, this world is lost
But your journey is not over yet
Your fate lies in your very own hands
And one day we will meet again
Either dead, or alive

Dead or alive
You were doomed you were damned either
Dead or alive
No escape your fate's sealed either
Dead or alive
You were doomed you were damned either
Dead or alive
No escape your fate's sealed either
Dead or alive

Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
