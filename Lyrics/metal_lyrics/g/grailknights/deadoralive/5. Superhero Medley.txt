Saber Rider...
Saber Rider, and the Star Sheriffs
Saber Rider, and the Star Sheriffs,

In the sky!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Heroes in a half-shell
Turtle power!

Go Go Power Rangers!
Go Go Power Rangers!

Sometimes some crimes
Go slipping through the cracks
But these two
Gumshoes
Are picking up the slack
There's no case too big
No case too small
When you need help just call

Ch-ch-ch-Chip 'N Dale
Rescue Rangers
Ch-ch-ch-Chip 'N Dale
When there's danger
No, No, it never fails
Once they're involved
Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved

Spiderman, Spiderman,
Does whatever a spider can.
Spins a web, any size,
Catches thieves just like flies.
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman.

We are flesh and bones
Gladiators, drenched in blood
Waving grailquest flags
Raised above our heads
We are flesh and bones
Gladiators, drenched in blood!
