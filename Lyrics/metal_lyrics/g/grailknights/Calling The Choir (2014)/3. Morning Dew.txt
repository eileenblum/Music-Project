[Chorus:] 
Welcome to tha age of rising terror 
Welcome to the time of damp, smoke and steam 
The future is near, the future is here 
A flash lights up the nocturnal sky 

Brothers we sail the deep blue sea 
To flee from a life full of misery 
Liquid pearis of morning dew 
Will glisten in silver 
When the sun breaks through 

We dance, we sing, we laugh and cheer 
We raise our pints and forget our woes 
Come my brother, come my friend 
All bad times must reach an end 
Tomorrow the sun will shine for us 

The wind is right to leave this land 
"Men stand up and be at hand" 
Get your goods an chattels out 
We turn our backs to dust and drought 

[Pre-chorus:] 
We dance, we sing, we love and cheer 
Fave the wind, taste the sald 
Feeld the breeze, there's no halt 
Tomorrow the sun will shine for us 
The clouds turn to black 
The heat is up 
The night comes back 
Our life is on the edge 
Of the abyss of righteousnedd 

[chorus] 

The opaque shimmer of a distant shore 
The tune of life and ancient lore 
The coast is near our place to dwell 
Well tanked up and straight to hell 

[Pre-chorus] 

[chorus] 

Morning dew is reflecting the fire 
As it devours our wishes and hopes 
Never give up, never give in 
Sons and daughters stand the pace
