Don't count the years 
That you've been waiting 
Come dry the tears 
Our hearts will remain (with you) 

The day has come 
To end all the silence 
The time is right 
We rise again 

Stand tall and face the north wind 
Call to arms, we march till the end 

Celestial dawn 
Hear the armies of the fallen 
Look to the sky 
Old strength they regained 

The day has come 
To end all the silence 
The time is right 
We rise again 

For years 
I've been waiting 
For years 
For this day to come 

Don't give in to your fears 
And you shall get what you deserve 
Don't leave the road 
Tonight strike back with no reserve 

[Chorus:] 
We shall regain 
Honour and might 
We shall reclaim 
Power and pride 

Eternal sunlight 
Illuminates the darkness 
Don't fear the end 
It's s all but a dream 

The day has come 
To end all the silence 
The time is right 
We rise again 

Stand tall and face the north wind 
Call to arms, we march till the end 

Don't give in to your fears 
And you shall get what you deserve 
Don't leave the road 
Tonight strike back with no reserve 

[Chorus] 

We must conclude 
Pain and demise 
We must exile 
Deceptions and lies 

Victorious 
Pass the flickering flame 
Victorious 
We shall remember your names 
Victorious 
Your lights will conquer the world 
Victorious 
Your voice shall not stay unheard
