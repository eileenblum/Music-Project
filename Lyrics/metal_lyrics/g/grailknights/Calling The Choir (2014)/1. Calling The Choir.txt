[Chorus:] 
Rise for the knights 
For the lords of land and seas 
Down, on your knees 
Kneel befor thy majesties 

Now it's official 
The troops have arrived 
The Choir is calling 
It's side against side 
While we're preparing 
The others attack 
They seem so much stronger 
but we have to fight back 

We've seen all the signs 
Too much blood has been shed 
We take a position and retaliate the dead 
It's brother 'ainst brother 
Mind against mind 
So punish the guilty and fight for mankind 

Forget where you're from 
Decide what to do 
Fight for a cause that's challenging you 
Be a backstabbin pain 
In the neck of the strong 
The choir is calling, the call is this song 

[Pre-chorus:] 
Hail to the knights 
Hail to their Battlechoir 
Blades break the spell 
A legend is born 

[Chorus] 

The first beams of light 
Mett the wide fields of green 
Yet peaceful and quiet 
They are not what they seem 

My true-hearted friends 
Beneath the meadow you lie 
Brave man of Grailham 
Your names shall not die 

[Pre-chorus] 

[Chorus] 

Regain what you've lost 
Defeat what you feared 
Reconquer the land 
Stand tall at all cost 

[Pre-chorus] 

[Chorus] 

Grailknights Battlechoir? 
Yes, Sire!
