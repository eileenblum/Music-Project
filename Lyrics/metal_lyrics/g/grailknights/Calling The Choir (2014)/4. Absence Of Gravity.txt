And when we finally arrive 
Time doesn't matter anymore 
There is just you and me 
And the absence of gravity 

Come away my child, we float into space 
Come away my child, soon we'll be embraced 
By day and night, bridal of the sky 
Rain shall weep our fall tonight 
For we must die 

It's growing dark 
Shadows crawl up the wall 
The evening damps 
In solitude they fall 

But one last page is left to us 
But one last page is free 
When on our thoughts the shadows fall 
We know it's time to flee 

[Chorus:] 
Fly in the absence of gravity 
Take leave of your sorrow-clouded eyes 
Float into the mists of insanity 
To the humming sound of mortal soul's last sighs 

Call me once before you fo 
Call and come away 
The wild winds now they homeward blow 
Alas! We cannot stay! 

[Chorus] 

And as gravity returns 
My body bends under a heavy burden 
A burden called life 

[Chorus]
