Feel the pain of the last goodbye 

For and away, let the past be past 
We left our footprints in the snow 
Through time rushes by, our flame shall not die 
When it's time for us to go 

Look back on time with kindly eyes 
There is no life without demise 
A life-lasting journey has come to an end 

[Chorus:] 
For and away, say where is all the time 
Years they came and swiftly passed by 
We bow to you all on this vernable night 
The spirit you spread shall be out guide 

Feel the pain of the last godbye 

While demons have taken control of my senses 
I slowly fade into a dream 
A comatose state, a figbound utopia 
Built on fire, mist and steam 

Please let me go 
You will not go that far 
Please let me feel 
You will not feel that much 
So let me live 
You will not live that long 
So let me die 
Oh, I grant you what you wish 

[Chorus] 

So far and away 
We'll meet again one day 
So far and away 
We'll meet again for the last goodbye
