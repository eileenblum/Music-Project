I saw the lights of the world 

[Chorus:] 
I saw the lights of the world 
I saw them shining 
Through the darkness of night 
I saw the lights of the word 
Not doom but elucidate my life 

Smell the steam and dust 
Taste the oil and rust 
Rop my heart dout of my chest 
And throw it into the mud 

Set my soul on fire 
Feel my great desire 
Join the rave hat leads us to the end of all time 
Leads us where the lights brightly shine 

Yeah, a fire breaks through the clouds 
Saint and sinners be free of all doubt 
This trip will last forevermore 

[Chorus] 

And when I'm long gone 
Beneath the shadows I dwell 
You shall feel no wrong! 
But pass my tale 

Through silence might reign 
In the dead of the night 
Life will return 
With morning's first dim light 
With morning's first dim light 

Woho, a fire breaks through the clouds 
Saint and sinners be free of all doubt 
This trip will last forevermore 

[Chorus] 

I saw the end of the world 
I saw it coming like a blizzard from hell 
I saw the end of the world 
A vision of the apocalypse 

"How well I knew the light before! 
I could not see it now. 
'T is dying, I am doing; but 
I'm not afraid to know." 

Weep now, or nevermore 
Sleep tight my silent queen 
I've lost my love 
I've lost my life 
Lost my will to go on 

Where you are, I cannot be 
Lost my reason to live 
In your hand lies the key to a world 
Where we forget and forgive 

[Chorus]
