Desert star 
Grow to the end of all time 
The red glowing sun 
Is guiding my way 

[Chorus:] 
Desert star 
Grown to the end of all time 
Storm, sand and rain 
Shall not seal your fate 
Desert star 
Enlighten my heart with your grace 
The red glowing sun 
Is guiding my way 
Shine till the end of all time 

Thright the land 
Swirls a violent storm 
Lifts the sand 
To carry it hundreds of miles away 
I raise my voice for the last goodbye 

For your sake 
I merge land and water 
For your sake 
I split the mountains in two 
I lift up my head and welcome the night 

A seed shall sprout 
Out of the soil 
Spread by my blood, sweat and tears 
A fragile plant shall 
Arise to new life 
And free me from all pain and fears 

[Chorus] 

The sun burns down 
On my desert star 
No promising cloud 
To shelter the plant 
Young life will fade 
There's no rain to come 

A seed shall sprout 
Out of the soil 
Spread by my blood, sweat and tears 
A fragile plant shall 
Arise to new life 
And free me from all pain and fears 

[Chorus]
