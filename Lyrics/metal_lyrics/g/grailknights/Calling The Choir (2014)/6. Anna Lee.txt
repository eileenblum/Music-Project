In the sad silence of night
Lurid sea, so still and dead
I heard Anna weep for her fate
Waves breathing the tears that she shed

[Pre-chorus:]
So Anna Lee gave her body to the sea
The ocean became her tranquil grave
No more sorrows, now she is free
Devoured by just one greedy wave

Anna Lee lost in the kingdom by the sea
By the sea with no shore
In the lone ancient kingly halls
She chose not to live anymore

[Pre-chorus:]
So Anna Lee gave her body to the sea
To reach ... she was never meant to be
The ... waves are her destiny
And now she's my queen of the sea

[Chorus:]
So I sailed across the sea
To find my dear Anna Lee
But the waves didn't let her go
And the wind never ceased to blow

Anna yearned for mountains and fields
She longed for flowers and trees
But most of all for just one single smile
And a slumber in the warm summer breeze

[Pre-chorus:]
So Anna Lee gave her body to the sea
The ocean became her tranquil grave
No more sorrows, now she is free
Devoured by just one greedy wave

[Chorus:]
So I sailed across the sea
To find my dear Anna Lee
But the waves didn't let her go
And the wind never ceased to blow
So I sailed to find the shore
But couldn't find home any more, any more, any more

Away, so far away
My bride is so far away,
Away, so far away
My love is so far away

I came to this hall where she was before
I shivered, I quivered but I opened the door
A sweet scent of violets in the air
But Anna, Anna Lee, no, she wasn't there

So close your eyes that one day you may see
Me sing songs to my sweet Anna Lee
So close your eyes that one day you may see
Me sing songs to my dear Anna Lee
So close your eyes that one day you may see
Me sing songs to my queen of the sea
