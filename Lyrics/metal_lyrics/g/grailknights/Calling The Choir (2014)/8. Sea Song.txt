Hey, hey 

Owayho - owayho 
A long time ago 
Owayho - owayho 
The tide is calm and low 
Owayho - owayho 
They row all night and day 
Owayho - owayho 
But none shall see his bay ever again 

Owayho - owayho 
Westwards we go 
Owayho - owayho 
Riugh winds begin to blow 
Owayho - owayho 
One more pull and then belai 
Owayho - owayho 
A storm to get under way 

[Pre-chorus:] 
Defying danger - hey 
Defying death - ho 
The highest wave 
Will never impale our spirit 
Winds toss - hey 
To and fro - ho 
Dead callous waves 
But we will never change our course 

[Chorus:] 
By the rooks, trees and water 
What if I never die? 
The world would be mine 
By the wind, rain and fire 
What if we are meant to see 
The dawn of a new day? 

Owayho - owayho 
Our hearts begin to glow 
Owayho - owayho 
It's time for us to go 
Owayho - owayho 
The cost is high, we can't delay 
Owayho - owayho 
Call the storm to get under way 

[Pre-chorus] 

[Chorus] 

On the sea with no shore 
I will hail you once more on the day that we part 
You will grow in my heart 
Farewell my good friend 
We'll meet again 

Brothers I'll hear from you 
When I'm on the other side 
Brother I'll hear from you 
Calling from the depth of the ocean 

When my heart beats for the cery last time 
I won't regret what grew on my mind 
Though fortune's denied 
I will stand by your side 
I will rise with the tide 
Till the end of all time 
Father can you hear me 
Deep down in my ocean grave? 
Father can you see me 
Below the spray of a geedy wave 

[Pre-chorus] 

[Chorus]
