[Bonus Track][Chorus:] 
You need a hero 
You're holding out for a hero till the end of the night 
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast, 
and he's got to be fresh from the fight 
You need a hero 
You're holding out for a hero till the morning light 
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon, 
and he's got to be larger than life, larger than life 

Where have all the good men gone 
And where are the gods? 
Where's the streetwise Hercules 
To fight the rising odds? 

Isn't there a white knight 
Upon a fiery steed? 
Late at night you toss and turn 
And dream of what you need 

[Chorus] 

Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Ohhhhh-ho 

Somewhere after midnight 
In your wildest fantasies 
Somewhere just beyond your reach 
There's someone reaching back for you 

Racing on the thunder 
And rising with the heat 
It's gotta take a Superman 
To sweep you off your feet 

[Chrous] 

Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Ohhhhh-ho 

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above 
Out where the lightning splits the sea 
I could swear that there's someone somewhere 
Watching me 

Through the wind and the chill and the rain 
And the storm and the flood 
You can feel my approach like a fire in your blood (in your blood) 

Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Oh-ho-ho-ho 
Ohhhhh-ho 

[Chorus] 

You need a hero
