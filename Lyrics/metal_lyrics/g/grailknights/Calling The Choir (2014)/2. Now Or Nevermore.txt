Many sails at rest 
Tomorrow I'll be blessed 
By a blast of wind 
By a distant glint 
By a swell of hipe 
That will shake the stars 

Lurking danger's near 
I have to face my fear 
In the spectral deep 
Death might have fallen asleep 
Silence screams out so loud 
Echoes eternally 

[Pre-chorus:] 
My life is a journey 
My life is a quest 
Does never stand still 
Remains in unrest 
My life is a battle 
My heart rests with you 
When the hour has come 
Leave no more ado 

[Chorus:] 
On the silent sea, sailling silently 
To the shores of eternity 
Where no breakers roar 
Will you greet us ashore? 
Brothers ho, it's now or nevermore 

And when all time's done 
I'll be standing one 
Behind the line of blue 
There I shall wair for you 
Beneath the silent Moon 
Beyond infinity 

In the dead of night 
Under the stars' dim light 
I dream beside the sea 
A dream that could not be 
The waves that meet the shore 
Say "Dreamer, dream no more!" 

[Pre-chorus] 

[Chorus] 

I know one day we will return 
I know one day we'll have to learn 
That life's too short to waste the days 
That life's too short to miss the pace 

[Chorus]
