Raging madness, chaos and decay
Black smoke darkens the day
Cries of wounded cut the air
A little fight turns into a nightmare
We're on the verge of war
So spring to arms and join us
No time to hesitate
Neither wonders nor
Prayers will help
It's just you an your sword!

[Chorus:]
We are flesh and bones
Gladiators, drenched in blood
Waving grailquest flags
Raised above our heads

Beyond sanity the dying goes on
Till both power and bravery are gone
From far away
The sound of pounding drums
Light is fading as evening comes
Forger, do not regret
Today we grind the battle-axe
No time to hesitate
Neither wonders nor
Prayers will help
It's just you and your sword!

[Chorus]

Into deepest spheres we drift away
Tell me, have we gone astray?
Our callous eyes stare into space
There is nothing but
Emptiness to face

[Chorus]
