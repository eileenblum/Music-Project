Mortem obi
Surrounded by silence
Amid the shadows of time
Hollow and deep
My future's dim ghastly shine
No stone may fall
No river may flow
No hedge may grow
Like time wore away
On that very day I spent with you
Dark is my future
Dark is my past
I've loved, lost and feared
My presence at last
Lost my will to live
Fell asleep on a dark, dreary day
I doze the centuries away
Wake me up from my sleep
And I'll be born again

[Chorus:]
Life's a journey, I'm a traveller
On floating streams
Don't seek my heart
It's lost forevermore
Life's a journey, I'm a traveller
With hope and dreams
Time fades away as
I gaze at the shore
Help me to care
My heart is beating loud and fast
Help me to bear the burden of life

A light straight from your eyes
Beams brightly through the night
I follow the road
The end out of sight
No candle may flicker
No sundown will ever glow
No river will ever flow
No day will ever pass
Faster than a day with you

[Chorus]

Utendum est aetate
Morituri te salutant
Utendum est estate
E vita cede mortem obi

[Chorus]

Mortem obi
