Now that I know that
Nothing remains
Stronger I am for there is
No time to waste
Make sure you are not
Only a piece of flesh
Make your life a tale
Either good or bad
Close to the embrace of tranquility
The sun is diving into the sea
Take a deep breath and
Save your dreams
Raise your voice and sing with me

[Chorus:]
Long-lost days will dawn again
Despair and sorrow will
Fade in the end
All the pain you suffer
All the tears you cry
Are not in vain
For they show you are alive
Lonely I dwell in a
Black endless night
Still I am waiting for a
Bright-shining light
Take me away from
Darkness and fear
Send me a sign that
Salvation is near
Stay awake, don't fall asleep
Carry on, hold on to your belief
There'll be times to show strength
There'll be times to bleed
Now raise your voice and sing with me

[Chorus]

Feel the morning sun warm your skin
Let a new day begin

[Chorus]
