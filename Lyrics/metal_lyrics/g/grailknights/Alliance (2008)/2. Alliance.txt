No cross, no crown, do beard a lion
Necessity knows no law
Never put off till tomorrow
What you can do today
Make assurance double sure
Far at the horizon we see the hords
Battlechoir, hail to you
Your will to fight, to hail, to kill
Oh Skull, prepare to die!
Evil dreads the cross
Evil flees from holy water
Evil dreads the rosaries
Evil flees from sunlight
We don't fear the evil
The Choir fears nothing at all
This alliance will never be broken!

[Chorus:]
Raise your fists up to the sky and
Show the world our
Long-famous sign
In this moment of
Honesty and truth
Ability is the poor man's wealth
The more danger, the more honour
A tree must be bent while it's young
United we stand, divided we fall
Choir, we're your biggest fan
A good name is better than riches
Skull, the worst is yet to come
Evil dreads the cross
Evil flees from holy water
Evil dreads the rosaries
Evil flees from sunlight
We don't fear the evil
The Choir fears nothing at all
This alliance will never be broken!

[Chorus]

Now raise your fists up to the sky
Give us the horns
Do the world right
Battle as if there's no tomorrow
And give the evil infinite hatred
We are the chosen ones:
Grailknights
You are our right hand:
Battlechoir
This alliance will never be broken!

[Chorus]
