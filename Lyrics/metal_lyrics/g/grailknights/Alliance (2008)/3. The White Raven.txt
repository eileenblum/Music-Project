The White Raven
I stood waiting at the
Wind-swept bay
For my ship come sailing by
The clouds broke open
I heard a young man's call
The White Raven
Sailed across the sky
I climbed higher and higher
Through the roaring storm
On a rope-ladder
I left my life behind
"Anchors away
And cast of the lines"
We conquer space and time
As I gaze at the world
From so high above
My heart grows heavy and
My mind fades away
As our vessel floats to
Celestial shores
I yearn for my home
A calm harbor to stay

[Chorus:]
We sail the clouds and
Seek the storm
Above the world
On our endless voyage home

The White Raven
Sailed across the sky
Black thunderheads
Piled up like hills
I saw lightning
Flash across the Sky
Death in the shape of
Golden snakes
"Is today the day we're going to die?"
I saw people run in panic
Shouting and screaming
My darkest fears had
Finally come true
But two eyes, full of hope
Looked at me
I'm sure they belonged to you
As I gaze at the storm
From right in between
My strength is growing
And sorrows fade away
As our vessels floats to celestial shores
Reminiscence of the past
My calm harbour to stay

[Chorus]

The White Raven
Sailed across the sky
The White Raven
