Eternity reigns
In the halls of our fathers
Echoes of wisdom they all tried to seek
Silence swallows the sorrows of ages
The kingdom of twilight
Devours our sons
Forged by fire
On a cold autumn noon
Evil hands hold the chalice
To enlighten our doom

[Chorus:]
As we stem the tide
We shift black to white
Turn fire into ice and then
We toss the dice
The die is cast and we are not the last
To suffer death a ten thousand times
Ride with me, let us make history
Rise to my calls, we burn down the halls
Before we shall live
We suffer death a ten thousand times
From the dark to the daylight
Our Choir marches on
Skull tried to compel us
To creep on the ground
But our banners are crossed
Till the day evil is bound
Now tremble in terror
'Cause the grail has been found!
Forged by fire
On a cold autumn noon
Evil hands hold the chalice
To enlighten our doom

[Chorus]
