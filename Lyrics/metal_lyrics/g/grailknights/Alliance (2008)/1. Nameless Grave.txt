Below the branches of
A lonely winter tree
High rocky slopes
Cliffs of the cold and lurid sea
Lost among the stars
Silver dew on a meadow fair
My silent pain
My diary of despair
Snow turned red when death was near
Her frozen tears so crystal-clear

[Chorus:]
Nameless grave by the sounding sea
In my wildest drams
She's still calling me
Innocence died, she died so young
Pale-faced moon
What have we become?
I only know that it was
Many a year ago
Old father moon shone brightly
And the tide was low
A ship from far away
Lay unmoved on the shore
Her gentle voice changed
My life forevermore
The wind whispers her tale of woes
I will not rest and I will never repose

[Chorus]

Nameless Grave
