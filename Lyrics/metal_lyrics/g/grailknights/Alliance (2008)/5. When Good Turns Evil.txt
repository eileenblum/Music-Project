His mind is twisted, his poor soul
Yearns to be free
His ugly body conceals a secret
No one can ever see
He was one of us
A long time ago
One day he broke the oath
And let the evil grow
Antagonize, recover your
Predestinated role
Don't let the beast within take control
Caught in anguish, slavery
And dubiety
Since he yielded to temptation
Damned to suffer endlessly
Once he was our fellow
A knight in shining armour
Now his torn nature
Does not know what to live for
Antagonize, recover your
Predestinated role
Don't let the beast within
Take control
Try to escape to resume your liberty
Never accept it to last eternally
It is not your fate, come along with us
It is not to late, regain old trust
Just break through, find confidence
We'll wait for you, refuse obedience
Antagonize, recover your
Predestinated role
Don't let the beast within
Take control
Try to escape to resume your liberty
Never accept it to last eternally
