In for the kill!
In for the kill is the call
Of a thousand throats
Came together at the gates of
Grailham City
Eager to fight we abominate the turncoats
Strong we are, side-by-side
Well tanked up but witty
Light in the east, heat of the south
Pride in the west, death from the north
Light in the east, heat of the south
Pride in the west, death from the north

[Chorus:]
Saving the grail is our entire desire
The sun never sets on the
Grailknights' empire
Tonight we are in for the kill

In for the kill, let us move
Heaven and earth
High-flyers as we are, the sky is no limit
March alone but strike together
No bitterness of hearth
No matter where you come from
Justice is the remit
Light in the east, heat of the south
Pride in the west, death from the north
Light in the east, heat of the south
Pride in the west, death from the north

[Chorus]

In for the kill!
Light in the east, heat of the south
Pride in the west, death from the north
Light in the east, heat of the south
Pride in the west, death from the north

[Chorus]
