Our sea-weary eyes
Our wind-tormented eyes
Are we driving on paradise
Or have we wasted all these years?

The wind is silent, the water is clear
But I feel something drawing near
Dry the tears of memory
Take a glance at the roaring sea

[Chorus:]
Ancient tune, gale's tranquil melody
Winds arouse the drowsy sea
Callous waves come crashing down
The maelstrom spins, we slowly drown

Raving Storms

The sun reveals a foreign land
On my knees I kiss the sand
Close to death in the cyclone's eye
It's time to live and not to die!

[Chorus]

Raving Storms

Time wears away as I'm pushed underneath
My life fades away as my powers decrease

[Chorus]
