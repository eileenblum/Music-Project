Grailknights battlechoir
Prepare to fight
It's up for you
Stand by our side
So spread your wings and fly away
Rise above the sky
We keep you close inside our hearts
Till the day we're gonna die
Waiting, hoping
Living for nothing
A wasted lifetime will never come back

[Chorus:]
Knights, fight until you die
On guitars we fly
Take the challenge, face the task
Swing the blade till you're the last
Become Immortal
Knights, fight until you die
Raise your fist up high
Feel the pain, feel the thrill
Battle on, it's time to kill
So fight until you die

You may die if you fight
You may scream for your right
So here we ware, the battle dress
Adorning our compound
So look at us, we are standing strong
And fight like a pack of hounds
Battlechoir, we're at your feet
With your support
We face the heat!!!

[Chorus]
