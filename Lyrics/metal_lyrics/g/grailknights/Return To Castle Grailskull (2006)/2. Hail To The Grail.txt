Impatiently
They can't wait to fight
The horn so loud
The sun drowns

[Chorus:]
Over mountains and seas
Over forests and fields
We live for our quest
And we die for our grail
Over rivers and lakes
Over castles and caves
We follow our hearts
Till the end of this tale
Come with me, rise with me
Fortune, be my guide
Fight with me, bleed with me
Till the morning light

Ja!

Atrocities
Each single day
A struggle within
Kills me

[Chorus]

Ja A sudden pain tears me down to the ground
The last insight, it deeply hurts, it's over now
Then, like a wave of relief, I close my eyes
Your praying words I can not hear, too far away
I spread my arms, flowed away through the mist
Flickering lights, a fleeting glimpse and it's all gone
And what remains is a tale, a story told
The light so clear, I'm on my very last way

Grailknights Battlechoir!
Yes Sire!

Hail to the grail![4x]

Ok, Ok, Ok, Battlechoir
Calm down Battlechoir!
I see you standing in front of me
Now I want to hear every single voice!
And when I say "every single voice"
I mean every single voice
And now, by the sake of our holy grail
Scream like you have never screamed before!
Hail to the grail

Hail to the grail
And now for the ladies!
Hail to the grail
For me!
Hail to the grail
All together!
Hail to the grail
For my mother!
Hail to the grail
For my grandmother!
Hail to the grail

[Chorus]

Yes
And once again
