A battle, raged in a galaxy far away
A long, long time ago
Without intervention no-one would live to see the end
A thousand dreams wiped out at one blow

Fly, warrior seek the open sky
Our trust, our fate, our life is at your feet
We're deaf, we're blind
We are seeds in rotting earth
We cannot live but die for you

My whole life - I waited for you
My whole life - I would give to you
I traveled so long - I saw life come and go
I'm so tired - take your sword and lead this army home

Unbounded space so large and wide
Luring mists devour me
Oh join my moonlit masquerade
I ride the wind, dispel your fears
I'm dying to be free
Oh join my moonlit masquerade

That night I felt like I've never felt before
The reinforcements - slowly passing by
They came to lead our nation back home
In peace, to live and to die

Draw the curtains, leave the theatre of war
In solitude only weak hearts remain
In the end, there's a whole new world to find
And there we may meet again

My whole life - I waited for you
My whole life - I would give to you
I traveled so long - I saw life come and go
I'm so tired - take your sword and lead this army home

Unbounded space so large and wide
Luring mists devour me
Oh join my moonlit masquerade
I ride the wind, dispel your fears
I'm dying to be free
Oh join my moonlit masquerade

Moonlit masquerade
Moonlit masquerade

We will survive!

Unbounded space so large and wide
Luring mists devour me
Oh join my moonlit masquerade
I ride the wind, dispel your fears
I'm dying to be free
Oh join my moonlit masquerade

Moonlit masquerade
Moonlit masquerade
