Hear the solemn Bell
It's song of mourning and grief
One of the bravest fell
He died by the rocky reef

The sky is darkens
And it turns as black as night
My road is long and lone
So I give my horse a fright

[Chorus:]
Brothers I'm coming home
But I not the one I used to be
I returned from the brave
I knelled over his grave
My son is lies under the old wise elm tree

Leaves sing and weep
'Cause softly shall he sleep
Roots guard his bones
Let him reign on heavenly thrones

[Chorus]

Years they come and go
Rain falls and rivers grow
Moon shine form e
So that I can see
My road, my road back home
My road, my road back home

[Chorus]
