Reach out for new horizons
Dissociate from all repellent
Elicit all powers
And prevail the stars

Your power is our repository
Our course is unique and steady
The task to obliterate
All ferocious stars

Past mountain peaks we strive
Through rotten woods we cleave
Never trying to hide
We will not allow any peeve

Devilish are the deserts we cross
Slippery the watersides
The moon, our lonely guide
Tells u to hold our head up high

[Chorus:]
Mile above the sea
I follow you, you follow me
Sunset over the battlefield
Good against evil
Brothers, we prevail
Thunderstorms are calling us to rise

Our heart is at the right spot
Our conscience, solid as rock
Grailknights is written on our flag

And if we face one day
A situation so desperate
Oh Gods, kill us, our choir lives on!

Across the lands and seas
Our spirit lives on
Our comrades-in-arms
Know that their task is to prevail

[Chorus]
