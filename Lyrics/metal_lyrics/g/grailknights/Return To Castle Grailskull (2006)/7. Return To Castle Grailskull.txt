Gather knights, we have a feast
At Castle Grailskull, former home of the beast
By axe and sword the best was slain
Still hear it waiting in agony an pain

The halls echo our song
'Bout the battlefield the place where knights belong
The echo dwells, the echo flies
Noble knights now it's time to rise

[Chorus:]
Heyja Heyja Hey [8x]

The hours pass, we sing our song
We drink our ale, the night is gone
Why can't this night last forever
Valiant men it's now or never

[x2][Chorus]
Hey Heyja Hey Heyja Hey Heyja Hey Hey[4x]

A thousand years have passed
Now we finally reach the last
We return to Castle Grailskull
Hear the cries of battle
Let us bleed for Heavy Metal
We return to Castle Grailskull

[Chorus]
