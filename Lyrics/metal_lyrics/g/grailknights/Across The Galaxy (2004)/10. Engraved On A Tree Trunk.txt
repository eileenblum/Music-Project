While furious storms our tree stands still
Powerfull it is when evil rises
Engraved on a tree trunk

At this tree we met, so we'll never forget
United we stand, fear's forever banned
Engraved on a tree trunk

This is the tree where we swore our oath
Where we crossed our swords, where we sealed our bond
We engraved a grail as a symbol of faith
And decided to fight, related by blood

For heavy metal we fight every battle
Our hearts are true and everything we do
Engraved on a tree trunk

This is the tree where we swore our oath
Where we crossed our swords, where we sealed our bond
We engraved a grail as a symbol of faith
And decided to fight, related by blood

Engraved on a tree trunk
