Fire!

A cry, a shade
Vanished into haze
You can throw my life away
But i'll never lose my faith
I belive in something
Something you've never had
You spread your lies now pay the price
Tomorrow you'll be dead

Regicide - Thunderclouds were swifty passing by
Regicide - Rays of hope, I gazed into the sunlit sky
Regicide - Turn the page, another day is gone
Regicide - Free your soul and your spirit will live on

Fire!

Ancient hills on the horizon
I lead you through the storm
Another time, another place
Our future king is born
Memories are forever
Engraved on my mind
Empty words, broken dreams
My old life lies behind

Regicide - Thunderclouds were swifty passing by
Regicide - Rays of hope, I gazed into the sunlit sky
Regicide - Turn the page, another day is gone
Regicide - Free your soul and your spirit will live on

Thunderclouds were swifty passing by
Rays of hope, I gazed into the sunlit sky
Turn the page, another day is gone
Free your soul and your spirit will sure live on
