Cradle of light, see the child
He looks as if he's only asleep
Little body, so cold
Despair - I've never felt that old
You took my one and only
You took everything that had meaning to me
Little body, so pale
Show your courage and find me the grail

The god's force within you
The sun has finally met the sky
I'm fire, I'm ice
Dawn has come, at last I breath again
Again

Days turn to years, haven't found
What we've been fighting for
Gods you lied, betrayed me, fooled me, deceived me
Faith is fading away
On my knees I kneel, hear the clank
The sound of breaking steel
Nothing left to live for
I throw myself into the sea

The god's force within you
The sun has finally met the sky
I'm fire, I'm ice
Dawn has come, at last I breath again
Again

I throw myself into - the sea!
I throw myself into - the sea!
I throw myself into - the sea!
I throw myself into - the sea!

I throw myself into - the sea!
I throw myself into - the sea!
I throw myself into - the sea!
I throw myself into - the sea!

Into the sea
Into the sea
Into the sea
Into the sea
