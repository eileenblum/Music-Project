Nothing lasts forever
but I know one thing surely will
Take good care of the fire
You know my friend, the flame must always burn

Come my brother, come my friend
All good times must reach an end
But a Grailknight's heart will beat forever
Feel its power that binds us together

A Grailknight's heart
A Grailknight's heart
A Grailknight's heart

And now as your face is wrinkled with age
Don't give up, there's still unrest in the air
Left alone, you feel deceived
Don't you know, action speaks louder than words

Come my brother, come my friend
All good times must reach an end
But a Grailknight's heart will beat forever
Feel its power that binds us together

A Grailknight's heart
A Grailknight's heart
A Grailknight's heart

Shrouded in darkness
Glory days far away
But it's beating, it's pumping, it's breeding, it's bumping
The sweet warm red blood through my veins

Shrouded in darkness
Glory days far away
But it's beating, it's pumping, it's breeding, it's bumping
The sweet warm red blood through my veins

Come my brother, come my friend
All good times must reach an end
But a Grailknight's heart will beat forever
Feel its power that binds us together

A Grailknight's heart
A Grailknight's heart
A Grailknight's heart
