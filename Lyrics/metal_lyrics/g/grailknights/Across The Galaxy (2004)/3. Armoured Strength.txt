Like trees, so high
But still don't touch the sky
Like flowers bloom
And fade with autumn's gloom
Our one desire
Is to find love burning like fire
We are damned forever
Fighting and dying together

Our fate's to fight
Filled with pride
With love inside

Our fate's to fight
Filled with pride
With love inside

Our grail gives us hope
And brings light do the dark
We are strong, we'll never fail
Whatever will come
Armoured strenght
Incorruptible minds
Vanity
Won't bring us down

Like streams flow
And trickle away
Like every single breath
Takes us closer to death
Our one desire
Is to find love burning like fire
We are damned forever
Fighting and dying together

Our fate's to fight
Filled with pride
With love inside

Our grail gives us hope
And brings light do the dark
We are strong, we'll never fail
Whatever will come
Armoured strenght
Incorruptible minds
Vanity
Won't bring us down
