Let's go!

Take your sword, leave this land
Follow us across the galaxy
Rays of light, strenght and pride
Grailknights save the universe

Grailknights unite
Let our dreams come true
Grailknights, let's fight
Leave behind what we've gone through
Grailknights, we rise
To hail our majesty
No Compromise

Feel my blade, know your fate
You will never lie to us again
See their fear, victory is near
Raise your swords and live forervermore

Grailknights unite
Let our dreams come true
Grailknights, let's fight
Leave behind what we've gone through
Grailknights, we rise
To hail our majesty
No Compromise
We free our galaxy
