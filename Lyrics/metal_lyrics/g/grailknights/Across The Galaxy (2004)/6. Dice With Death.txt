Born under tyranny
Creator of my destiny
Cataclysmic idolatry
Consequence of idiocy

Grails high, we fight side by side
Until the battle is won
The air is burning, the earth is bleeding
The wheel is turning on

Now throw the dice
Suffer the ignominy of your lies
Imminent danger of collapse
Starving in the aftermath

Grails high, we fight side by side
Until the battle is won
The air is burning, the earth is bleeding
The wheel is turning on
