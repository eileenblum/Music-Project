Pale hills, a dead cold sun
The sky is about to crumble down
The rain like teardrops it falls
The end is near

A day like hell
Struggling against swoon
Ride on, my battlehorse
The mission has to proceed

My guardian angel
Where have you gone?
I am dying
I am lost

No feelings anymore
Too weak, too tired to go on
I'm losing hope for I am
All alone down here

My guardian angel
Where have you gone?
I am dying
I am lost

Fading slowly, misery
Lost in darkness, cruelty
Nightfall, painful death
Take my final breath

My guardian angel
Where have you gone?
I am dying
I am lost
