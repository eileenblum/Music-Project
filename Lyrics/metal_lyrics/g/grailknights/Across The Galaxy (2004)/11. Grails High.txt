Riding the horses of steel
Power and pride's what we feel
With the swords in our hands invading the lands
Of the keeper of the holy grail

Fire!

Four heroes born, sons of the storm
Guitars and drums are our weapons
We have a grail to which we we hail
It gives us power and pride
Cold morning's dawn, our grail is gone
Dark mights have stolen our honour
Galactic Grailknights, we have our rights
We have to reconquer our grail

Grails High
Riding the horses of steel
Power and pride's what we feel
With the swords in our hands invading the lands
Of the keeper of the holy grail
With the swords in our hands invading the lands
Of the keeper of the holy grail

Fire!

Grailknights fight, deepest night
Dragon wings spitting with fire
Clashing swords, inhuman gods
Unwilling to return the grail
We felt victory, had no casualties
Our enemy was defeated
Escaped from hell, nothing more to tell
Pride is all that we feel

Grails High
Riding the horses of steel
Power and pride's what we feel
With the swords in our hands invading the lands
Of the keeper of the holy grail
(Und jetzt alle!) With the swords in our hands invading the lands
Of the keeper of the holy grail

Riding the horses of steel
Power and pride's what we feel
With the swords in our hands we invaded the lands
And reconquered our lost holy grail
With the swords in our hands we invaded the lands
And reconquered our lost holy grail

Grails
High, High, High, High, High, High, High, High, High, High...
Galactic Grailknights
Grails
High!
