Why can't you see? Why don't you care?
My misery, a cry of dispair
Between the devil and the deep blue see
Everlasting pain is killing me

Follow the trace of ecstasy
Fearful, not faceless into eternity
My past is shown by a flash of fantasy
I'm leaving this world with dignity

How long will it take till you see?
Set me free
I lived my life, no more reasons to be
Set me free

I fall asleep, no will to live
Sanity fades, forget and forgive
Let me with nothing, nothing at all
Look in my eyes, this is our fall

How long will it take till you see?
Set me free
I lived my life, no more reasons to be
Set me free

Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!

Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!

Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your mind!
Cut your chains and free your...mind!

How long will it take till you see?
Set me free
I lived my life, no more reasons to be
Set me free
