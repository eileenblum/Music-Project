Faith, pride
And justice
Is what we're living for, born to resist,
just as long as we live sheltered by our gods

I cross the lights and see
I see your face
Nocturnal misery,
I'm on my way

You feel
So frightened
Run for your live, you can never escape
Your faith lies in our hands, you better prepare for us

Eternal heat inside
Just like the mighty sun
We'll burn you with delight
Your dying has begun

Good bye
Little worrier
You've been too weak, now you must pay for your seed
You should see there's no sense, you are no match to us

I cross the lights and see
I see your face
Nocturnal misery,
I'm on my way

Faith, pride
And justice
Is what we're living for, born to resist,
just as long as we live sheltered by our gods

Eternal heat inside
Just like the mighty sun
We'll burn you with delight
Your dying has begun
