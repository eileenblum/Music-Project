Shredded, minced and eaten
Hacked into red mush
Scalped, shattered and drained
A tasty, savory lunch
Ripped apart and mangled
Thrown around with fun
Chomping soggy flesh
Having loads of fun
Severed arms, flayed skin and legs
Travel through the air
The smell of blood and savage love
Wreak havoc in your brain
To climax in dark ecstasy
A small habit of mine
I'm quite a shy and modest man
Until it's splatter time...

This 7" was issued on CD in 1993
