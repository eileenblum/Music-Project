Tenacious muck, your windpipe holds
Larynx numb, on clotted filth you choke
Your bloated corpse, a greenish shade of white
Flesh slips loose, your view of death revised
Body coated in clinging putrid waste
Septic clots urine and excrement
Stomach juices seep out of ragged cracks
Internal gases, gather in your torso
Your thorax filled, your corpse slowly ascends
Burst upon the surface, for the public soon to find...
