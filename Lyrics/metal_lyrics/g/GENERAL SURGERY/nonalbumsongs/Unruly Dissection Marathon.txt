[2012 "A Collection of Depravation" compilation track]Corpse after corpse
Dismantled in haste
A never ending flow
Of decomposing waste

Snorting amphetamine
Feverishly fighting fatigue
Focus on the task at hand
Anatomizing endlessly

Slicing and incising
Disjointing and dividing
My sanguinary efforts succeeding
The piles of corpses receding

Cart the corpses in
Another fetid bout
Dichotomize the stiff
Wheel the remains out
