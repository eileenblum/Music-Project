[2012 "A Collection of Depravation" compilation track]Crimson-tinged circuits
Gristle-soaked cogs
Gasoline and formaldehyde
A mixture of mucus and rust

The clash of skin and metal
Shredded brawn and bones
Crushed by stainless steel
Reap the corpses that you sow

Discretely sneak away
As the contraption bolts out of control
