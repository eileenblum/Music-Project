Pathological waste abounds
Cadavers lined wall to wall
Foul-whiffing stiffs all around
A bonfire would clean it all

Frenzied cauterization
Now seems slightly passÃ©
A more gleeful method seems fitting
To spread havoc and disharmony

Dispensation of carrion embellished
In a delightfully mirthful way
The disposal of my spent toys
A most superbly distasteful fray

Mannequins discretely exchanged
For a different fashion model
Now view the spring collection
As worn by bloated corpses

The ghastly remains strategically placed in public spots
Much to the amusement of my like-minded pathologist chums

De-truncating limbs, slack heads are lopped
Soak the pieces in preservatives to debar foul rot
Wrap the stinking presents and then regroup
To deliver bloody packages to your front stoops

Blithely positioning cadavers on a park bench
Horrified children recoil and blench
Hang a corpse by its intestines from a nearby tree
For the public to admire my disposal methodology

Our gruesome tasks masked by off-putting gaiety
The jocular demeanour veils your repugnance but barely
Jovially dissecting and disposing of the gore
Our brash disposal methods leave you shaken to your core

Unauthorized surgeries
Dismantling anatomy
Solemnizing necrotomies
Convivial Corpse Disposal Methodology

Suspended stiffs on wires
Make for hours of entertainment
A pus-dripping puppet show
An enchanting display of debasement

The jovial sense of misconduct
Derived from the publics disgust
Young and old repelled by the reek
of rank, putrefying meat

The mortuary waste diminishing for every prank
Cadaveric clean-up of my vile, putrescent body bank

Tossing rigored stiffs from embankments and cliffs
Setting carcasses ablaze, and other procedures most comedic
Our ingenuity is tested when our patients die
Inventive methods of disposal our modus operandi

Villainy demonstrated with our internment techniques
Bodies stored in 50-gallon drums until they start to leak
Mincing the dead into finely ground organic scrap
Mulching your garden with our latest mishap

Rollicking through our disposal drills
Dispatching the murdered is better than the kill
Slowly dissolved in acid, encased in tar
Or dumped in plastic bags from a moving car

Unauthorized surgeries
Dismantling anatomy
Solemnizing necrotomies
Convivial Corpse Disposal Methodology
