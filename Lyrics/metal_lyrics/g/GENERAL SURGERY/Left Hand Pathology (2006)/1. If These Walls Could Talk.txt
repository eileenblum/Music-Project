If These Walls Could Talk
The tiles splattered with waste
Intestinal fluids and sinew
If these walls could talk
Theyâd regale with tales of horror

An anthology of vitiation
If these walls could talk

Mute witness to the horror
A sanguinary cataclysm
Malicious vivisection
Vile dismemberment

An anthology of vitiation
If these walls could talk

A desensitized beholder
Of decadence and bloodshed
A murderous dystopia
Filtered crimson red

Cold harsh stone
Clotted with offal
A permanent audience
To regular dissection

An anthology of vitiation
If these walls could talk
