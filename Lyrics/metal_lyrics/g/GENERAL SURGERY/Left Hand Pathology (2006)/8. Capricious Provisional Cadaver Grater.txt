Splinters of bone - Flesh turns to mince
Sinew &amp; phlegm - Fragments of skin

Flesh and muscle stripped
Layer by putrid layer
Strands of reeking waste
Fetid strips of meat

Splinters of bone - Flesh turns to mince
Sinew &amp; phlegm - Fragments of skin

Noxious putrid corpses
Rasped and razed to stew
Effectively ground down
By this murderous contraption

Untested apparatus
With a penchant for structural failure
Unproved waste disposal
A heinous carrion grinder
