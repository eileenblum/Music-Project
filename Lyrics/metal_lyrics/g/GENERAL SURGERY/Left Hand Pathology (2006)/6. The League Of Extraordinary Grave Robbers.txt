Disinter and subjugate
The freshly buried corpses
A vaguely high-brow fetish
For me and my distinguished colleagues

Exhumation an honourable task
To rid the cemeteries of their casks
A gentleman and body snatcher
A closet frenzied carcass slasher

Venerable dissection
Undignified post-mortem
Unauthorized vivisection
A villainous consortium

A nocturnal raid on the morgue
To relieve them of superfluous corpses
An impossible task to perform
Without my fellow deviant surgeons

Venerable dissection
Undignified post-mortems
Unauthorized vivisection
A villainous consortium
