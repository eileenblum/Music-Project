Exhume to investigate
Reflect on corpse criteria
The perfect specimen, suitably fresh
Untouched by disfiguring trauma

The grave robbing business
A lucrative offence

Appropriate subjects in shortage
Mucopurulent stiffs refused
Gaseous corpses discharging pus
Unacceptable for medical purpose

Create your own cadaver
Deliver the recently dead

Defile and disinter the freshly deceased
Inadequate to meet the growing needs
Furtively smother the sacrificial mark
A fine cadaver to pride the anatomy slab

A lethal business venture
Anatomical counterfeiting
A murderous vocation

Cadavers fermented to gunk
Entirely inappropriate
likewise the crushed and gored remains
of bloody industrial mishaps

Efficient body snatchers
Reap the harvest of deathâs mailing

Defile and disinter the freshly deceased
Inadequate to meet the growing needs
Furtively smother the sacrificial mark
A fine cadaver to pride the anatomy slab
