The stench of a rancid mass
Is advancing
Mortuary guests
Are piled up for cutting

Abdomens protruding
With gas and fluids
A straining workload
Reeking of death

Examine bloated corpses
Gore induced neurosis

Necrotizing
Inflammatory lesions
Dead infection
With lethal outcome

Another case
Of necrotic infection
Another day, trying to restrain
This mental pain

Examine bloated corpses
Gore induced neurosis

With increasing aversion
Another incision
Along the spine to the sacrum
Necrocriticism

An expression of contempt
For pathological attempts
Sever the abdominal septum
Necrocriticism

The heinous stench
Slowly inducing
Loathing
