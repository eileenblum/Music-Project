Epidermal carnage
Putrid convalescence
Problematic healing
Necrotic fabric fails

Dermatome misuse
Post mortem chemabrasion

Electrolytic stimuli
Reanimate the cells
Wield the soldering iron
With bold artistic flair

Assorted tools of the trade
Sculpt the failing flesh

Dermatome misuse
Post mortem chemabrasion

Newly deceased subjects
Fresh from funeral homes
From dearly departed loved ones
To vile degenerate sculptures

Epidermal carnage
Putrid convalescence
Problematic healing
Necrotic fabric fails

Assorted tools of the trade
Sculpt the failing flesh
