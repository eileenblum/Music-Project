Lifeless, stagnated
The idle teratoma core

A neoplasm in overdue removal
How long have you suffered from this tumour?
A fairly stable but abnormal mass
Located in the pelvic cavity

Lifeless, stagnated
The idle teratoma core

The x-ray now revealing
A dead embryonic appearance
Itâs quite a shock, a perfect spine
Look at that little round skull

The skullâ¦

Lifeless, stagnated
The idle teratoma core

Within the womb
Undelivered foetus,
Failing to be stillborn

Immediate
Surgical procedure
Time for the awaited abscission
