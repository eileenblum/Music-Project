Subsequently you are now deceased
And of this I will keep quiet
I know just what they'll do
When it's time for an autopsy

No, I'll keep you here for myself
I cherish your corpse
Never mind the decomposition
I'm so eager to watch you rot

I'll have the honours of the necropsy
Apparent coronary failure
Congestion in the tissues
The final cause of death

No, I'll never let you go
I restrain your remains
Relish in the glorious decay

Rotting
Excruciating stench
Drain
The blood from the cadaver

Corpse fluids seeping out
No doubt, it's a fine mess
No cause for distress
I'll keep your body clean

I really want you to look your best
Adore the shrunken remains
The cadaverous features
Has come out really nice

No, I'll never let you go
I restrain your remains
Relish in the glorious decay

I cherish your corpse
I restrain your remain
Never mind the decomposition
I, I restrain your remains
