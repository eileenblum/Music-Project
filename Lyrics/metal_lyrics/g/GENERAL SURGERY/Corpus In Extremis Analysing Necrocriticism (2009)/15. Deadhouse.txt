Temporary storage
Of recently deceased
Vile depository
Of festered remains

Cadavers abused
Mortal waste misused
Deadhouse
Carnival of ruined souls
Deadhouse

Desolate waste
Ravaged and defaced
Post mortem malpractice
Rotten sustenance

The end of the line
Beginning of the end

Cluttered with discarded limbs
Caked in viscous gore
Unnecessarily sound proofed
Mutilated cadavers galore

House of degenerate morals
A theatre of dissection
Slaughterhouse of humans
An abode of Putrefaction

Obscene preservatory
Guts brazenly dis
