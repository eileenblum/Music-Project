Corporal remains, arriving disjointed
Freshly exhumed, bagged &amp; tagged in an orderly fashion

A few
Are severely decomposed
The rest
Are primed for embalming

Preservation, forestall decomposition
Immersed in acetone, immortalized in neoprene

The rotten
Are divested of their flesh
Excreting
Sarcous matter from the bones

Remove the rot
By detruncation
A carnal deformation
The final excarnation

Atrocities
So sublime
For a deranged mind

Fools of the trade, in covert congregation
For excoriation, arrangement and depravement

The rotten
Are divested of their flesh
Excreting
Sarcous matter from the bones
