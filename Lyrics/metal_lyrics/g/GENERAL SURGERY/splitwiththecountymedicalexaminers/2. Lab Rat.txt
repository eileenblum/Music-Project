Wreaking anatomical havoc
Chugging formaldehyde
Rabidly gnawing on exposed bone
In the noble name of science

Feasting in a macabre gloom
I'm overcome with bliss
The rotten specimen fills the room
As I frenziedly hack at the hateful putrid stiff

Parasitical theory in practice
Rectal juices extolled with verve
The pinnacle of evolution
Dismembered and befouled with zest

Pustular chunks of internal decay
decorate the walls
Intricate patterns from gastric juice spray
The aftermath of my assault

The fortunes of working in medicine
An outlet for predative zeal
The general intolerance of corpse desecration
Guarantee my results remain unseen
