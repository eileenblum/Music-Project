Curtail the infection risk
Diminish the festering decay
Ignite a petrol soaked rag
To keep putrefaction at bay

Charcoaled extremities snap
Roasted epidermis cracks

Count the many advantages
Of flambe sterilization
Diminished viscosity and less pungent emanations

Incinerated dearly departed
Smouldering mortal remains

Whatever extremities are in reach, I purposely set alight
The defunct flesh antisepticised
Singing my cuffs and inhaling fumes

An oxidizing theme
A coruscating concerto

Curtailing the inferno to no avail
The corpses blazing in a fuming arrayal
The point of calcination rapidly reached
My work place a pathological rotisserie

Mortuary barbequed specials leaking ignited grease
Sizzling streams of melted flab spreading with unsettling speed

The blackened flame-ridden morgue
Ravaged by fetid oxidation
