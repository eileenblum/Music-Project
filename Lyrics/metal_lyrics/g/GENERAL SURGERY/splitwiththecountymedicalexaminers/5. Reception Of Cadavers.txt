Hospitality in excess
where the dearly departed rest
Badly diguised glee
and crudely concealed zest

Discretely cart in the stiffs
Out of reach of prying eyes

Descend into the realm
of disputable medical practice
Deteriorating shells
Carted into this cadaverous abyss

Discretely cart in the stiffs
Out of reach of prying eyes

Finely honed beguilement
Conceal the true intent
of pathological deviance
The desecration imminent

Retaining a front of respect
In the watchful eyes of the public
But down in the bowels of the morgue
The methods become more drastic

Skewered and ravaged with unbounded bliss
The cold meat is pillaged with impetuous zeal
The facade of courtesy shed with relief
Replaced with a frenzied ecstatic butchery

Seemingly pointless havoc
Is our profession's forte
A haven for our inclination
for anatomical carnage

As stocks are yet replenished,
reverence abounds
In solemn silence the deceased are wheeled
Into our aberrant netherworld
