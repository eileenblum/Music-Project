Mummified sinew resists
To the point of exasperation
A lengthy submersion seems quite apt
Inadequate tools have this solution begat

A preparatory soak is required
To achieve the result I desire
Sulphuric acid in excess
In this cocktail your corpse needs to rest

Fermented hulks
Disjoined with ease
Mucilaginous limbs
Dislocated as I please

Await the appropriate time
To dispose of the corrosive sludge
Environmental crime
Added to my misconducts

The resilience of the tissue
Now virtually non-existent
The corpse itself a free-flowing mass
The bones, themselves liquescent

Fermented hulks
Disjoined with ease
Mucilaginous limbs
Are uncomplicatedly freed

The problematics involved
Take on a different guise
Protective clothing and facial masks
I stress are of great importance

Pondering this method
I reminisce of Haigh
I spare a thought for his inherent genius
As at the remains I effortlessly hack away.
