You were saying something deep
I was feeling incomplete
You were shaking with conviction
I was making up my mind

Blacken the sky
It's over
Killed by contradiction
Fixation is all that's left behind

Blacken the sky
It's over
Killed by contradiction
Fixation is all that's left behind

Blacken the sky
It's over
Killed by contradiction
Fixation is all that's left behind

Kill it to life
It's over
Dead by definition
Frustration is all that's left behind
It's over

You were waiting for a sign
I was planning my next line
You were bent on self-destruction
I was there to load the gun

Blacken the sky
It's over
Killed by contradiction
Fixation is all that's left behind

Kill it to life
It's over
Dead by definition
Frustration is all that's left behind
It's over

It was all so beautiful
It was all habitual
It was all so beautiful
It was all a ritual

You were saying something deep
I was feeling incomplete
You were shaking your addiction
I was there to find the vein

Blacken the sky
It's over
Killed by contradiction
Fixation is all that's left behind

Kill it to life
It's over
Dead by definition
Frustration is all that's left behind

It was all so beautiful
It was all habitual
It was all so beautiful
It was all a ritual

Blacken the sky
Fixation is all that's left behind
It's over
It's over
Frustration is all that's left behind
