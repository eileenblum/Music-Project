Fade out on a theme
Fade out and away
Break down to extreme
Break down in decay

Fade out in the dust of my debris
Fade out and away
Break down in the absence of extremes
Break down in decay

Green and cream, selective and pure
Shape my sin to your will
Crystalline, a chemical cure
Dance me down to the kill

Dream now of the frost
Dream now of the grave
Bleed out for the lost
Bleed out for the saved

Dream now of the fiction of the frost
Dream now of the grave
Bleed out for redemption of the lost
Bleed out for the saved

Green and cream, selective and pure
Shape my sin to your will
Crystalline, a chemical cure
Dance me down to the kill

I consume and control
Break your mind on my wheel
I can swallow your soul
Strip away all you feel
I can feed your disease
Close you down from within
I can be all you need
Once I'm under your skin again

No solution for the undefined
No solution inside
Revolution psychoanalyzed
Revolution denied

I'm erratic and bold
Problematic and mean
Enigmatic and cold
Charismatic and clean
I can feed your disease
Close you down from within
I can be all you need
Once I'm under your skin again

No solution for the undefined
No solution inside
Revolution psychoanalyzed
Revolution denied

Pull me out of the dark
Into your stars
Into your sky
Pull me out of the dark
Into your arms
Into your light

Pull me out of the dark
Into your stars
Into your sky
Pull me out of the dark
Into your arms
Into your light

Fade out in the dust of my debris
Fade out and away
Break down in the absence of extremes
Break down in decay

Green and cream, selective and pure
Shape my sin to your will
Crystalline, a chemical cure
Dance me down to the kill

Pull me out of the dark
Into your stars
Into your sky
Pull me out of the dark
Into your arms
Into your light
