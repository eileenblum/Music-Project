One voice inside
(I know who you are)
One feeling you hide
(This is the season of denial)
You're in control
(Don't ask me how I am)
Your cracks start to show
(There's someone laughing from afar)

Turn around and face the darker side of you
(The one you hide)
Turn around the face the damage that you do
(In the season of denial)

Too cold to feel
(I know what you've done)
In motion surreal
(This is the season of the hollow)
Who are you now?
(I am for you to name)
You're on your way down
(You're somewhere very close to hell)

Turn around and face the darker side of you
(The one you hide)
Turn around the face the damage that you do
(In the season of denial)

I will remember you
Keep the pain alive
A vision of black and blue
Fading into white

I will remember you
Keep the pain alive
A vision of black and blue
Fading into white

A weight of years... before the storm begins
Saturate the rain-dark sky
Wake in fear and face the dream that might have been
The dream you still deny

You don't remember when, you don't remember where
A faded stranger in a photograph
Half-seen faces whisper shapeless unaware
Silent echoes of what's come to pass

You know you can't return, you know you can't relive
As you wasted wreckage falls apart
Familiar places where you know must have been
In your heart of darkest hearts

I will remember you
Keep the pain alive
A vision of black and blue
Fading into white

I will remember you
Keep the pain alive
A vision of black and blue

One voice inside
One feeling you hide
Turn around and face the darker side of you
(The one you hide)
Turn around the face the damage that you do
Turn around the face the damage that you do
Turn around the face the damage that you do
