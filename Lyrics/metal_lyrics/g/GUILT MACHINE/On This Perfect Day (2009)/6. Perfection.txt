You look different in this light
Thoughtful in the morning air
Shifting in the golden glow of the array
Still I'd know you anywhere

You look distant in this light
Troubled in the morning air
Waiting for a chance to live what you've become
I'd see trough you anywere

And all the things you are
And all you've lost
Is perfection what you really want?
And all the skies we shared
The dreams we walked
I'll be waiting here alone
When the darkness calls you home

You look tragic in this light
Shattered in the morning air
It feel apart the day they learned your name
Still I'd follow anywhere

You look dangerous in this light
Desperate in the morning air
Waiting for the chance to live what you've become
I'd see through you anywhere

And all the things you are
And all you've lost
Is perfection what you really want?
And all the skies we shared
The dreams we walked
I'll be waiting here alone
When the darkness calls you home

I was lost
In the perfect world they promised me
I was scarred
When you tore the mask away
I was amazed
At the lies we refused to see
I was afraid
Of the emptiness the truth would leave behind

You look distant in this light
Troubled in the morning air
Waiting for a chance to live what you've become
I'd see trough you anywere

And all the things you are
And all you've lost
Is perfection what you really want?
And all the skies we shared
The dreams we walked
I'll be waiting here alone
When the darkness calls you home
When it calls you home

What's one more year?
A trip around the sun?
Rise up and leave here
The journey's done
What's one more year?
A circle in the sky?
The future's in motion
You're free to fly

Can we heal the past?
Do we dare to stand alone?
Can we take it back?
Make a new life on our own
Can we heal the past?
Do we dare to stand our ground?
Can we take it back?
Can we turn it all around?

What's one more year?
A trip around the sun?
Rise up and leave here
The journey's done
What's one more year?
A circle in the sky?
The future's in motion
You're free to fly

Can we heal the past?
Do we dare to stand alone?
Can we take it back?
Make a new life on our own
Can we heal the past?
Do we dare to stand our ground?
Can we take it back?
Can we turn it all around?

Can we heal the past?
Do we dare to stand alone?
Can we take it back?
Make a new life on our own
Can we heal the past?
Do we dare to stand our ground?
Can we take it back?
Can we turn it all around?
