Our dominions take hold to a myriad of fantasies
For my gift is frozen beneath the ground

Within the coldest part of the universe
Extending our contact
The absolute silence

I grasp at existence
My will be the gateway
My angels of black-winged birth shall accompany 

Blinded by the visions of night
I enthrill these illusions
In my sight, our sanctuary
The hollow of ages
Downward are the keepers of sanity
Bound to honour
In night we rise to infinity
Free creatures of an era

Constant shrouding of all that is lost again
Redirect and extend to the holy

I grasp at existence
My will be the gateway
My angels of black-winged birth shall accompany 

Blinded by the visions of night
I enthrill these illusions
In my sight, our sanctuary
The hollow of ages
Downward are the keepers of sanity
Bound to honour
In night we rise to infinity
Free creatures of an era
