Descendants of this burning world align
No longer will this yearning persist 
For my craving yields a path of future endeavours
The gates of hell arise as they welcome their sons

Blessed be the dark through which I burn

The souls of the righteous reborn
My hand to them forever shall feed
Docile the fever
The night is growing near, prepare the feast

Cursed be the light from which I hide

Once sought of is a burden to all
Prospective militant repercussions
Instantiate complete and utter slaughter
No mercy for all

Break their will and dissolve their lies
Wield sudden terror upon their lives
The very earth will shake beneath us
Our will be done, the cursed rise

This pure extinction
An orchestration of madness
Invested in the centuries
The gods shalt our promise endure
This faithful sacrifice
An eternity of blood

Descendants of this burning world align
No longer will this yearning persist 
For my craving yields a path of future endeavours
The gates of hell arise as they welcome their sons

Blessed be the dark through which I burn

The souls of the righteous reborn
My hand to them forever shall feed
Docile the fever
The night is growing near, prepare the feast
