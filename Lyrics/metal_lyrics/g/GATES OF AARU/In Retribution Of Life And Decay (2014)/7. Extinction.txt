The winds of cold eroding disease
Death awaits this chilling new terror
Through suffocation and strain
Departures are growing near
Their everlasting dark effect on memories 
That will forsaken me
On this world, my continous grave

Within this selfless terror
I call within this martyrs grave
The cult shall preach
The savior engaged to which obsession drives
Then they all confess
Despite their self-resistant state of mind 
They shall obey
Dwelling in their aggression
For fear that on this day
These walls will give into unholy ways

The winds of cold eroding disease
Death awaits this chilling new terror
Through suffocation and strain
Departures are growing near
Their everlasting dark effect on memories 
They've forsaken on this world
