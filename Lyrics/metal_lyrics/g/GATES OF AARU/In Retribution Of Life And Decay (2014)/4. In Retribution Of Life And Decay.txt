Guide us into the heart of darkness
Prepare to invoke a new-born king
Reinstate this kingdoms throne

Bewildered with patterns of mortal chaos
Engage towards roads of fathomless bleeding
Thus shalt be torn from their limbs

Our minds move towards a slumber
Our eyes are to motion deterred
Remove the curse of fleeting shadows

And embrace for what once was our earth
Where the Witch &amp; the Omen depart
Their souls are now lost in the vortex of nowhere

And so it is written
In the halls of the keepers
These wounds bare witness to our torment
The creatures evolution plays still to our domains
Yet filled to the brim are our wastelands

Sworn to the altar for our sacrifice
I slave the way to this world of torture

I am the force that is beneath the shattering ground
Disclosure in the heart of the all-divine

For waiting to regain this space
I awoke to ungodly worlds
Displaced with the hate of the human race

Desolation covers all distant light
The night of a thousand burning

For the mighty shall give their wrath
To instill those washed in sin
With the never-ending curse of life
Then bathe in the horrors that await their kind
Destruction, the seed of all sights
In Retribution of life and decay.
