Flames cover the walls
As the hordes of the angels engage
The swarms of the dead
Invading their dreams
Stained with their sorrow for me

Cast down the soul of the mother of birth
Send down for their whores
The liars shall nurture our thirst
Creating an escape to our destiny
Liar

Countless lost in the perpetual hatred
A sea of bodies flow through the canals like wine
The spilling of their blood so beautifully tainted
With their children

Death's wake, an eye into other worlds
Shows the divine
In numbness, in the dark
Where nothing exists save for our time
Humans are cultivated like cattle
Thus welcome in the standing ovation for divinity
Inflamed, burning alive

Salivation at the flesh
Our hunger denies us the mind
Fleeting perception enthroned
The waste of a breath
For a sinner, now mine
Their lords, the cause of men
To dictate and direct their final end
