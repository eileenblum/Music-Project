Maybe it's raining because I spun off with a dosa on top of my cat,
Sat in the almighty sun till it dried nice and hard.
Oh where's my head gone, close to home.
I'm headstrong.
On the floor pool of blood
What happened
A pounding on my skull sent a sonic boom through my head gold club falls sending another vibration through my temple,
A mist makes it hard to see.
All I can feel are the thorns and rocks dragging against my back,
Feet bound like a newly bound back.
I'm leaving this song to disperse my ashes across the audience.
