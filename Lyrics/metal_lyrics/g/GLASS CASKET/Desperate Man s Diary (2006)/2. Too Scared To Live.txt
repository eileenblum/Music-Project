Lurking in the background, my only talent, gotta hide because I can't help holding back,
No more my flood will wash away anyone who has given up,
That's the last thing they would have wanted you to do.
Can you see me now?
I'm stuck in between the sheets and getting out of bed,
The honest moment I was wishing I was dead.
Stuck kicking nickles for a dime a dozen a day,
Minimal wages for a minimal life right?
