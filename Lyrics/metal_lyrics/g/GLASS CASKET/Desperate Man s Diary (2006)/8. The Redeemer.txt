Tears seem to melt out my brain,
This faucet seems too big to turn off by myself
Someone please step in,
Without letting my mother know I want to die,
All I wanted was a garage to park in
Let Sigur Ros play on as I drift away.
Answer me, answer me.
Let God speak to me,
Tell me why my brains so fucked up,
And why I cry daily, frequently.
Why'd you rip my sister off the face of the Earth,
Facing me with new Hells
While she files free like a bird
