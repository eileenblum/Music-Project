Mustn't draw in
So fond, I'm
So fond, I covet her
On her pedestal
Betray

Blind by her
I couldn't see this coming
Not by my best friend
Knife in your back
Don't want your jealousy
Insane

Act like nothing is wrong
But I'll tell you right now
I should've never
Chopped you up and buried you under my floor

Betray, heartbeat
Insane
Dismembered, In pieces
A burden, I should never have taken on
Should have never chopped you up
And buried you under my floor

Can you live with what you've done
Guilt-ridden, buried under my floor
