Can you plan for life's composition
Anatomy of everything-stream of consciousness
Interworking of the mind set in motion
A lack of attention, paid to detail
Proving theories - so much harder with a living subject
Drawing conclusions, a lapse in judgement
Purest form, except nothing less
Technical in it's simplicity
Break it down, can't you see
So much harder when you are the living subject
Drawing conclusions

We did not invent the wheel,
We just keep it spinning
Like a thirteen story jump
From a twelve story building

All who had come before, some became
Architects of failure, others made success look easy
But you know it isn't

All I know is every lab rat has its day
Even though it lives its life the same as the others that way
pass away

Here we are, engineering
What can we take from this plan
