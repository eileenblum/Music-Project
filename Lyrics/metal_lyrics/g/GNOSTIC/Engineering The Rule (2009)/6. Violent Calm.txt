How does it feel
To know you can try like you always will
Can't stop me from falling up this hill
Say what you say
But what in your life has made you this way

I won't run or walk away
The worlds you spit can be taken away
It's over, that's all you can tell yourself

You can't break or bend the way I feel
And you know, you ain't shit
Always the same, you just sit right there

These things that you say, I can't remain

The strength in your numbers makes me laugh
And it always

Will

What makes a man push those,
Buttons that signal the end of call

Violent
