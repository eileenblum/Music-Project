Under the weight of the clown
We're all dead weight
Under nefarious rule
It's too late
Under the weight of the world
Gravity
Dimensions of hate
Isolate

Isolation, perception, isolation
Perception
Four-walled world
Two-faced lie
Forcing down
Ignorance
Perception
Your mind's
Split decision

Under the weight of the world
We're all dead weight
Under nefarious rule
It's too late

Under the weight of the world
Isolate
Paranoid
