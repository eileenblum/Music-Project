Come get some

Check the door, secure the latch
Something is about to hatch beneath
this dead skin,
That's where the bleeding begins
With all that's been done to me
With the blind leading the blind
Hard to walk the line
Mindlock, mindlock your head is
Unscrewed and your mind is locked

Locked,

After all I have bared,
Nothing is shared,
Owe you nothing, life's not fair
thoughts better left alone, who cares
Now life's fucking you back
Almost felt bad for this
Time's short you can't bleed me,
time to realize!

Mindlock, mindlock

Now your head is screwed and your mind is locked

Locked!

Note: "Get your head out of your ass"
