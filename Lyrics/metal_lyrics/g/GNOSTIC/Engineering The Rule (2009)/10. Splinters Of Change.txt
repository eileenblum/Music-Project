Plowed under make way for change
Everywhere it's all the same
Scrape the land clean
So nothing remains unchanged

Years from now come back around
Where the childhood stilts were found
Old becomes new and still we're bound

Still frames inside my mind
The only thing's that left behind
Is this broke-ass infrastructure

Splinters of change
Sink in deep
IN the name of progress
From right here this progress
is minimal at best
Splinters of change
skin in deeper, deeper
This world's plowed under
As now the river flows into the sewer

Splinters
