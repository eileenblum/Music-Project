Inside our tombs we dead await
In endless gloom we contemplate
We shall return, as prophesied
So break the curse and we will rise

Once we were knights
In the service of Christ
Now to Satan sworn
On this unholy night
Under the pale moonlight
We will be reborn
Templar dawn

Templar dawn

For centuries our cult has grown
Now they will raise our blackened bones
Cursed by the king, burned at the stake
Seeking revenge, we now awake

Once we were knights
In the service of Christ
Now to Satan sworn
On this unholy night
Under the pale moonlight
We will be reborn
Templar dawn

Grand Master!

Ride out!

Out of the crypt, we ride again
To lay waste to the world of men
Our eyes are blind, our flesh decayed
But still we wage our black crusade

Once we were knights
In the service of Christ
Now to Satan sworn
On this unholy night
Under the pale moonlight
We will be reborn
Templar dawn
