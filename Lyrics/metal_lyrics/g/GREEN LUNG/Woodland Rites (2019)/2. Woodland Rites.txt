At the gloaming on Walpurgis night
In the forest you saw our fires alight
The trees were talking, they whispered your name
Darkness was falling as you walked towards the flames

Oh yeah!

Now you stand before the sign
Yeah, you canât believe your eyes
Dancing naked in the night
Wonât you join our woodland rites?
Our woodland rites

Christian woman, you couldnât resist
So you came closer, just to catch a glimpse
What you saw, youâll never forget
In black smoke the form of Baphomet

Oh yeah!

Now you stand before the sign
Is this all in your mind?
Dancing naked in the night
Wonât you join our woodland rites?
Our woodland rites

You wake up in the morning sun
No memory of what was done
And you cannot understand
Why thereâs blood upon your hands

Now you stand before the sign
Yeah, you know that itâs your time
Dancing naked in the night
Wonât you join our woodland rites?
Our woodland rites

Come, join our ritesâ¦

Our woodland rites!
