I heard them calling
At witching hour, just before the dawn
I had the feeling
That I had heard their song somewhere before

Deep in the marrow
That melody awoke something in me
An ancient evil
At once I knew I had to set it free

From the field and the furrows
And from the trees
I hear the call of the coven
Calling to me

At the height of the summer
On solstice eve
I hear the call of the coven
Calling to me

I tried to fight it
Oh how I begged, I pleaded and I prayed
But it was too late
In a stupor I was drawn toward the glade

Somnambulating
I couldnât tell what was real or a dream
There in the clearing
Skyclad, they were beckoning to me

From the field and the furrows
And from the trees
I hear the call of the coven
Calling to me

At the height of the summer
On solstice eve
I hear the call of the coven
Calling to me

Callingâ¦ callingâ¦ calling to me

So begins the Sabbath
Witches whirling up into the sky
I am their captive
They will force me to conceive their demon child

From the field and the furrows
And from the trees
I hear the call of the coven
Calling to me

At the height of the summer
On solstice eve
I hear the call of the coven
Calling to me
