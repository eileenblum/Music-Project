Youâve spent your whole life in the service of God
Down on your two knees to save your soul
Weâve been watching, everything you do
Our Lord and Master has great plans for you

Sister, youâve been told
That making loveâs a sin
Open your heart
And let the devil in

Sister, canât you see
His mark upon your skin
Open your heart
And let the devil in

Come to the last house on the left of the street
In the red room our circle will meet
Wear nothing more than a long black hood
And a pendant of tannis root

Sister, youâve been told
That making loveâs a sin
Open your heart
And let the devil in

Sister, you can try to fight
You know youâll never win
Open your heart
And let the devil in

Let him in
Let the devil in

Sister, youâve been told
That making loveâs a sin
Open your heart
And let the devil in

Sister, let it go!
Give yourself to him
Open your heart
And let the devil in

Let him in
Let the devil in
