In time you will see
Whatâs behind the leaves
Carved in bark, the devilâs mark
Follow me to the Ritual Tree

If you come down to old Hagley Wood
Who knows what you might find?
See the black candles lighting the way
Through the branches entwined

In time you will see
Whatâs behind the leaves
Carved in bark, the devilâs mark
Follow me to the Ritual Tree

Past the dark rows of oak, ash and thorn
To the twisted Wych elm
With its trunk hollowed out and deformed
Like some gateway to Hell

In time you will see
Whatâs behind the leaves
Carved in bark, the devilâs mark
Follow me to the Ritual Tree

She is waiting here beneath the boughs
Do you dare look inside?
Hand of Glory is pointing at you
And thereâs nowhere to hide

In time you will see
Whatâs behind the leaves
Carved in bark, the devilâs mark
Follow me to the Ritual Tree

Who put Bella in the Wych elm?
Iâll never tell
