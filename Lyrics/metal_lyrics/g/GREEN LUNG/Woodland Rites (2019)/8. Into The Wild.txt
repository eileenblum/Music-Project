Spent all winter waiting
For the sun to arise
Longing for isolation
For the starlit skies

Dreaming of the forest
The whispering pines
Soon as the summer comes
I will step out of time

Now Iâm going out into the wild
For once in my life I feel alive
Now I find my way into the wild
Here to stay until the day I die

Tried to live the city life
But it came to no good
Tried to be civilised
But I never could

Never felt satisfaction
Never felt at home
âTil I went to the woods
And I lived alone

Now Iâm going out into the wild
For once in my life I feel alive
Now I find my way into the wild
Here to stay until the day I die

No sense of self
No sense of time
Here I have found
Some peace of mind

Now I am nothing
I am nobody
At the edge of nowhere
I am finally free

Up here on the mountain
Iâve got my own space
Feel like I dropped out
Of the human race

No hope for mankind
No, theyâll never learn
Yeah, Iâm going to sit back
And watch the world burn

No sense of self
No sense of time
Here I have found
Some peace of mind

Now I am nothing
I am nobody
At the edge of nowhere
I am finally free
