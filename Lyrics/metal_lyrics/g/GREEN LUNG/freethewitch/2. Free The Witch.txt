They say she rode with the Devil
They say she bears his mark
They say she danced in the forest
With a goat long after dark

Ah, they know not what they do
If they burn her they are doomed

Cause sheâll curse them
Sheâll hex them
And thereâs no way to protect them
Ah, theyâve got to free the witch

Sheâll curse them
Sheâll plague them
And thereâs no way to save them
Ah, theyâve got to free the witch

Free the witch

They say she ruined the harvest
They say she spoiled the crops
They say sheâs part of a coven
Meeting in the blasted copse

Ah, they know not what they do
If they burn her they are doomed

Cause sheâll curse them
Sheâll hex them
And thereâs no way to protect them
Ah, theyâve got to free the witch

Sheâll curse them
Sheâll plague them
And thereâs no way to save them
Ah, theyâve got to free the witch

Free the witch

Malleus Maleficarum
