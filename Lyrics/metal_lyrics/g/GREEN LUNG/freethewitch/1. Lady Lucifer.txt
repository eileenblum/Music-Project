You first came to me in a dream
At once I knew you were my queen
You smiled with lips incarnadine
Whispered black magic rites obscene

I knew just who you were
Lady Lucifer
Evil walks here on earth
Lady Lucifer

In the black night you called my name
Your nails caressed my windowpane
Thunder cracked, then came the rain
Woke up bleeding from an open vein

I knew just who you were
Lady Lucifer
Evil walks here on earth
Lady Lucifer

Lucifer!

No!

Ooh, I canât run, I canât hide
Cause sheâs inside my mind
Ooh, I canât run, I canât hide
I feel her by my side

Ooh, I canât run, I canât hide
Sheâs got me hypnotised
Ooh, I canât run, I canât hide
In love with Satanâs bride

I knew just who you were
Lady Lucifer
Evil walks here on earth
Lady Lucifer

Ooh, I canât cry, I canât yell
Ring out the funeral bell
Ooh, I canât cry, I canât yell
I'm stuck under her spell

Ooh, I canât cry, I canât yell
Itâs time to say farewell
Ooh, I canât cry, I canât yell
Sheâll send me straight to hell
