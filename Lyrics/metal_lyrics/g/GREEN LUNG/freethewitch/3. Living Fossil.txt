Born before time
Last of my kind
On this doomed earth I was left behind

In the abyss
Never surface
Unless summoned by the slowest riffs

Living fossil
Iâm built to last
Living fossil
I'm a blast from the past

Centuries pass
Without a glance
I transcend time in my narcotic trance

I dwell alone
Aphotic zone
Awakened only by the lowest tone

Living fossil
Iâm built to last
Living fossil
I'm a blast from the past

I have watched the ages come and go
Never dying, living slow
Nothing I can do to stem timeâs flow
Never dying, living slow

Living fossil
Donât move too fast
Living fossil
I'm a blast from the past

Living fossil
In a void so vast
Living fossil
I'm a blast from the past

Prehistoric pariah
I just get higher and higher

Live slow
Never die
Iâll spend an eternity getting high
