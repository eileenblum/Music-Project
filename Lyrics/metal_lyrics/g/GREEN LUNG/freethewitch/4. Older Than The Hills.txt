Iâve heard them say
This land is cursed
Itâs in the water
Itâs in the earth

Iâve heard them say
It haunts this place
Though it has no name
Though it has no face

So they say, so they say
By the watermill
There it lurks, there it lays
Older than the hills

So they say, so they say
When you feel the chill
Run away, run away
Itâs older than the hills

Iâve heard them say
Itâs in the trees
You can hear it moan
Itâs on the breeze

Iâve heard them say
Just let it in
Into your bones
Under your skin

So they say, so they say
By the watermill
There it lurks, there it lays
Older than the hills

So they say, so they say
It cannot be killed
Run away, run away
Itâs older than the hills

You try to escape
Ah, you never will
It is here to stay
Older than the hills

Itâs been here always
And it lives here still
Ah, it has no name
Older than the hills

Older than the hills
