Spent all winter waiting
For the sun to arise
Longing for isolation
In my perch on high

Dreaming of the mountains
The whispering pines
Soon as the summer comes
I will take back whatâs mine

Now Iâm back on the track
Freak on a peak
Just me and my pack
Freak on a peak
Now Iâm homeward bound
Freak on a peak
No use down on the ground
Freak on a peak

Tried to live the city life
Didnât do me no good
Tried to be civilised
But I never could

Never felt satisfaction
Never felt at home
Til I went to the woods
And I lived alone

Now Iâm back on the track
Freak on a peak
Just me and my pack
Freak on a peak
Now Iâm homeward bound
Freak on a peak
No use down on the ground
Freak on a peak

No sense of self
No sense of time
Think I finally found
Some peace of mind

Free as a bird
Like an orphan child
Couldnât help but answer
The call of the wild

Up here in my tower
I got my own space
Feel like I dropped out
Of that human race

No hope for mankind
No, theyâll never learn
Iâm going to sit back
And watch the world burn

No sense of self
No sense of time
Think I finally found
Some peace of mind

Free as a bird
Like an orphan child
Couldnât help but answer
The call of the wild
