Iâve seen the Green Man
With his face of leaves
Carved on the church wall
High in the eaves

As I passed by him
Heard him call my name
Can this be real?
Or am I insane?

Ooh, now I can see
I am the sacrifice
Ooh, now I believe
The Green Man shall rise

Into the wildwood
I walk entranced
Deep in the shadows
I hear them chant

Compelled by his power
To my forest tomb
I let out a mad laugh
I know I am doomed

Ooh, now I can see
I am the sacrifice
Ooh, now I believe
The Green Man shall rise

Ooh, under the trees
I am the sacrifice
Ooh, blood on the leaves
The Green Man shall rise

I stand in the circle
Watching as he takes form
As life drains from my body
I see the Green Man reborn

Ooh, now I can see
I am the sacrifice
Ooh, now I believe
The Green Man shall rise

Ooh, under the trees
I am the sacrifice
Ooh, blood on the leaves
The Green Man shall rise

Green Man rising...
