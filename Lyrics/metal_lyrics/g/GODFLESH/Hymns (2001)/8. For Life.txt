I'm feeling, unneeded,
I'm seeing, believing,
so that I can be but nothing else,
maybe I'm a loser, no victory,
'cause I'm in it for life.
I'm in it for life [x3] Deceiver, believer,
can't finish what you've started,
try feeling the pain of someone who suffers more,
I feel the pain of everything, it's what I am,
I'm in it for life,
and I feel it for life,
I'm in it for life,
I feel it for life. [repeat 1st verse]
