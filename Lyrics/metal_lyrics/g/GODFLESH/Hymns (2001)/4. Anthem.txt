And I found my soul,
when every feeling has been crushed by your world,
and you know, I'll find,
my purity inside is all that's mine. You make me feel what you feel,
I will become you 'cause you know what's real,
and I'll see what you see,
you'll never be me 'cause I've found my soul. [repeat 1st verse]
