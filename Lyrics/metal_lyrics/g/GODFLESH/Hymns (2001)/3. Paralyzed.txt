From birth to death, just a slave,
From birth to death, what am I,
I can't believe in myself,
I can't see past myself, Why should I fight [???],
why should I fight, turn my back,
Nothing can hurt me if its not real,
From birth to death, it's all the same From birth to death, just a slave,
From birth to death, what am I,
Nothing can hurt me if it's not real,
From birth to death, I'm just the same
