[--Chorus:]
Someone somewhere scorned
Never will forget
Someone somewhere scorned
Never can forget

Burning, No desire
No friends, Inside my mind

I'll never change, Yet still you burn
I'll never change, And I feel scorned

[--Chorus:]

Burning, In our mind
Inside my mind, Burns desire

[--Repeat 2nd verse:]

Scorned

[--Chorus:]

Burning, No desire
Your mind, Inside my mind

I'll never change, And I feel scorned (?)
I'll never change, I must be burned
