Ascend, Faceless
Naked, I am yours

See me naked, I'm dying
I needed you, my face is _f..._

Ice Nerveshatter, dead and dreaming
Bow to me. Bow to me.

I am defeated, I gotta walk away
I won't walk away. Let me see.

And I needed this you watch me
I'll bleed to death, watch me

Do you feel it?
When you're gone you're gone
Do you feel it?
Why did you leave?

Feel it.
Feel it.
