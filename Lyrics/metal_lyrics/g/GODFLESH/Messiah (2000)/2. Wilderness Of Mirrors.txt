Keep back
don't move
keep back
don't see 'Cause I'm the fool
always in doubt
yes I'm the fool
not here for you It's mine
feel free
it's mine
all yours [repeat chorus] I'm the fool
always in doubt
yes I'm the fool
not here for you back
cuts
mine
yours (yours, yours
i'm in the wilderness
the wilderness)
