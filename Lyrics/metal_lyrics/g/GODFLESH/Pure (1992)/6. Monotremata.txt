Feel Free, Be afraid (a freak?)
Head held high, Arms held high

You drown in your hurt [X2]
Don't want to belong
Don't need to belong

Don't need to be afraid
To build these walls
You just need to return
Just nod your head

[Repeat 3rd verse:]

Just nod your head...

Free her

Feel Free
Always will
Head held high [X2]

[Repeat 2nd verse:]
