all my fears
looking where to hide
all my fears buried deep inside
easy for you
your skin's so tough its hard
easy for you
you only see what you want
angel by your side
easy for you
how could you be so weak
easy for you
everything looks just fine
all my fears
looking where to hide
all my fears
they'll get in you in time
