i'm gonna get defiled
in your world i'm naive
like a lost child

now i don't seem so strong
are my delusions real?
i'm not right nor wrong
all i can feel is the same old shit
build me up
break me down
and then be done with it

so i'm the one you say's unreal
teach me then slay me
only cold i feel
well you see i'm still standing here
the only thing you taught me
was to feel fear
i feel fear
