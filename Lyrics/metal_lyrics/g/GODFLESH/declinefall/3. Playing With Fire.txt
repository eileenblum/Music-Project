There's a source 
There's a light 
Born of fire 
Born of water 
Circular logic 
Endless endings 
Empty meaning 
Dead eyed beings

It's all pain 
There's no gain

They build jails
For you and I 
To reside in 
To desire in 
Dictated meanings 
Dictated feelings 
Invisible chains 
Visible pain

It's all pain 
There's no gain
