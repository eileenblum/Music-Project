The screams are not yours
the speech is not yours
Ancestors speak with your mouth
They are not buried underground
But live in the trees, the wind...The Will!!

You are not one
And your body is not full of demons
But full of warriors, Soldiers
Body &amp; Blood is past, present, future
And when you sleep the graves open inside your memory
"We are not Gone! Surpass Us!"

Make your screams speech of knowledge
Enlight the dark blood of our Forefathers
You are not one! You are not one!
Sense them, enlight their unger, follow the path
And give the son Command
To be greater than you are
