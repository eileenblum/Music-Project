Golden Throne in an Mountain empty in a valley of death
Hard roads full of traps and living veins with 'poison' blood

We are the next Ones
Claiming the Throne Again
Eternal and Oldest Spirits
We will Rule

Patiently the await to sit and stand there
Inside the hearts of many bringing Hellenism to their souls..

Golden Throne - Golden Dawn - In our Hearts - In our Hearts - Our Claim - Blood continue - In our Hearts - In our Hearts

The oldest Throne will rule, eternal claim to sit and stand there in the highest Mountain..

Hail Golden Dawn - Hail Golden Throne - Hail Golden Dawn!!
