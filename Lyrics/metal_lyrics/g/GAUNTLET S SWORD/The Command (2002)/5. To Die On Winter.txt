Waiting for the dark to show up in the sky, in the stars, in my eyes

Waiting, waiting
For the time that melancholy will fill my heart

If your time will come to die then I fortune you to die on winter
To Die on Winter!

I lament for this many times
I have been expecting...so that
The star sign will be hide
To abide the dark wintertime
The deep slumber of Stars
Summoning end..up timer

Waiting the advent to be ceased, never in the sun, leave the light!
Invite the wild air and sea, the moving ice trees, the voices of nature
Waiting to expire but still existing, in the arms of wild nature
