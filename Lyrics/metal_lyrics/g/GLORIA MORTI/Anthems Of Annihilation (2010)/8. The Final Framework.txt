The resistance withers and dies
A feeble attempt to rid the disease
The cycle still runs within its own scorn
Machinery bounds and grinds

The only way to end all of this
Is mutually assured destruction
Nuclear patterns to set life free
Cells forced to disintegrate

Life has become meaningless
Why did it lead to this?

Is victory truly the opposite of defeat
or do they walk hand in hand?
If life in the fatal chapter ends itself,
does anyone really win or lose?

Bring down the sky

The final framework is being set
All life to be poured down to the vortex
By the hands of the true chaos design
Life will spiral into oblivion
