The decision has been made, solution: crush the cancer
Man equals fuel for the machine, devour the plague
Deliberately unstoppable; no turning back
Armed to wipe out what once was so precious

Chaos and death rise from the horizon
Insects cling to their beloved weapons
A shadow is cast over the land
The sky is filled with screams and smoke

War!
Rape the resistance!
War!
Feed on the confrontation!

The troops keep flooding in, with overbearing power
Gaining strenght with every consumed defender
The machine swarming with foul parasites
Disease ans sheer strenght on their side

Suffocate the mankind!
