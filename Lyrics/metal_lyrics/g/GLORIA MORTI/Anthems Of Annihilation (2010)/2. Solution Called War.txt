They will make the world bow down
But first they must in-animate the strong
The sickness will be cut out by force
Suffocated and torn to a million pieces

The prophecy
Will be brought upon us
By humans
With their machines

Sleeping underwater

Massive beast, being built under the waves
Hidden from curious eyes
To be constructed to kill for fear
To be made to serve the power

Hour of slaughter is soon to be witnessed
The great machine thinning the herd
Hour of slaughter is soon to be witnessed
Strings attached to the hands of evil

Life in these times a luxury for few
Death a compromise for a greater purpose
Soul the only comfort at the end of existence
God warbringer made of cells and alloy

Cold, dark, silent and sleeping
Waiting to be filled with death
Unaware of its own rising
Surrounded by a troop of parasites

Hour of slaughter is soon to be witnessed
The great machine thinning the herd
Hour of slaughter is soon to be witnessed
Strings attached to the hands of evil
