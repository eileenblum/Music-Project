Life is a form of chaos
Uncontrolled stream of energy
No one is there to guide or to protect
In the end there is nothing to lose

All ends in death
No religion or belief is the savior
You run in the shadows
Trying to catch something bound to vanish

All you will be left with is silence
A cold rock spinning in a void, without continuance
The earth finally gets to rotate unburdened
Like it was never contaminated by life

Nothing will remain
Nothing overcomes
All merely ends
Ceases to exist

The circle finally closes!
