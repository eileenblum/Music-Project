Rise and proclaim
For it is the only way
You shall not receive
Anything you do not demand

Chaos breeds from suffering
It dwells under the surface
Waiting for the perfect moment
Uncontrolled and omni-directional

Resistance rises once again
War is in the nature of flesh
Rip down, destroy and rebuild
Gather the forces, prepare to die

Bring down the machines
Rein the flood of energy
Bio-mechanical umbilical cord
Cut from the beloved gaia

Yet it will not prevail
Life in all its forms
Death is the only purpose
The destination we all share

Rise and proclaim
For you will have to try
You shall not live
If you are not willing to die

Chaos breeds from suffering
It dwells under the surface
Waiting for the perfect moment
Uncontrolled and omni-directional

Resistance rises once again
War is in the nature of flesh
Rip down, destroy and rebuild
Gather the forces, prepare to die
