Resistance torn to pieces
Stripped from weapons and pride
Chains twisted around their necks
The sky has been blackened

Humans turned to machines
Pulling blocks, building nests
Pyramids made of bones and metal
Humanity has been shattered

Forge
Heated and hammered into shape
Pride
Raped and toss to flames
Equality
Unknown to power
Obey
Or be forgotten

The very existence becomes one's shackles
A diabolical monument of suffering

An entire generation failing
Failing to free the next
This is the final judgement
These are the fires of Gehinnom

Machines swarming the earth
No escape for the wicked
Eat, breed, build, repeat
No sign of hope beneath

Forge
Heated and hammered into shape
Pride
Raped and toss to flames
Equality
Unknown to power
Obey
Or be forgotten

The very existence becomes one's shackles
A diabolical monument of suffering
