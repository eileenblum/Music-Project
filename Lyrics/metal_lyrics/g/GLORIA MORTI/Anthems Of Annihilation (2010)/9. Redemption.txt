The end rains down from the sky
As if the heaven was weeping
All hope is lost in the shadows
Mankind is bound to lose

This is what you had coming
Rain of death to end all of this nonsense
You stupid animals, fighting over land
Soon, no more war, death or screams

The smell of burning flesh fills the air
Innocent are the ones who suffer the most
This is what you had coming
Rain of death to end all of this nonsense

Look to the sky
It cries

All will perish!
All will perish!

Everything is lost, the earth in flames
Humans tore down what they built
Exchanged their lives for victory
All hopes and dreams burnt to the ground

Mankind was unable to face defeat
Now there are no generations to save
The last act the most vile
Tearing all life from the earth

The smell of burning flesh fills the air
Innocent are the ones who suffer the most
This is what you had coming
Rain of death to end all of this nonsense

Look to the sky
It cries
