It has been brought to life, to bring death
Guided by the lack of knowledge or symphony
It will crush and feed on human flesh
Unleashed to spread fear amongst the insects

The discordant machine
Brought to life by the ones with the windfall
The discordant machine
The world will bleed on the ones with the downfall

Scorch the earth
Feed, breed, build, and repeat

The discordant machine
Brought to life by the ones with the windfall
The discordant machine
The world will bleed on the ones with the downfall

Biblical beast made by man, rises from the sea
Seven heads, ten horns, bio-mechanical
The queen of machines, conceives more alloy
To rule the earth, conceives more alloy

Feed
Breed
Build
Repeat
