A meaningless form of existence - invalid, obsolete
The founding structures of Eden - scourged, incomplete

Remnants begin to wither
Slowly turning into dust
Dispirit living to desperate voids
Rain wails of liquidation

Life span is ephemeral, short and fragile
A brief passing moment in grand river of the Nile
A vain, pointless era of deception and deceit
Where loss is consolated with a promise of defeat

Denouement of era spent beneath these lambent stars

Under time's sabrewings late beauty lies rotten
Washed away by tides, forgiven and forgotten
Pictures tend to fade, memories decay
What remains after Death will be taken away
Sleep off the scorn, die away the shame
Dwell present in comfort of end left to claim
Beneath fondeling sun flesh begins to reek
Stork carries a disease in it's break

Certain ends dawning daily
From reddened infected wombs
Unscriptured faiths guide us blindly
Cities invert to tombs
Sad are only the Deaths that no-one laments for
Mourners bring light to the fallen

Remnants begin to wither
Slowly turning into dust
Gaze in admiration the sheer sweetness of her art
Even Devil rests in black riuns of the heart

Death - A promise of victory
