Drop dead and rot!

Fed to the worms
The flesh slowly disintegrades
And Mother Gaia shall feed upon
those Earth-dwellers who have fallen

One with the earth
One with the dirt
Deep beneath the exterior dismay
One with the earth
One with the dirt
Enshrined is the beauty of decay

Convicted to such vile deformation
We learn the pleasures of putrefaction
Bonded, we rot below the common sun
The glorious scent of injustice undone

Away from the flesh
Thoughts will sease to haunt
Dreams no longer disturb my sleep
By the umbrageous banks of Sty
