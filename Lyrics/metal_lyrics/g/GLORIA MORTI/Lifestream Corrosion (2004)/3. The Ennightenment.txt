I stand in abhorrent enclosure
I tremble draped in melancholic exposure
In the dust lies a past of suffocated dreams
Wearing a savor of bitter tangerines

The Lion has been crushed within
scourged, dressed in smothered grin
Ipour on the ground the Sage's water
Recognizing my life, as a spiritual slaughter

Oh, sweet grief - The Suffering
A mere portrait of such fullfilling emptiness
A pale pose of a faint mourning light
Seems so ravishing in the trance of veiling darkness
My Plagueness - The Darkening
My story resembles an ill satire
Every ounce of strenght I had I gave to heal those around me
For that I'll burn in a hellish fire

To whom I'd leave this restament
For I withstood the EnNightenment

I recoil, I repent
Every single word I ever said
Every single smile I used to fake
Every single step I chose to take
I recoil, I repent
Every single word I never said
Every single kiss I never gained
Every single gift I ever gave

Undesired by those who I loved, I never gave a day for myself

Narrow scapes of mind shrunk choking all that was still left in me
Horrid void of memories smudged everything I ever wished to be

The maze I've wandered through has been long, cold atrocity
The craze of dying tempted me by sudden loss of dignity
The cross on stony wall did not seem to pardon me
The truth I could not bear, but still, it was my destiny

Grim coldness, stone fortress
Allow this to end here, now, today
Alone forever, dreamless tether
Please let me sleep this grief away
Alive but never living
Never gaining of constant giving
Never having anyone to hold
An angel to behold

...an angel to behold...

I told to myself: "This man will never break!"
I thought this man would never break
