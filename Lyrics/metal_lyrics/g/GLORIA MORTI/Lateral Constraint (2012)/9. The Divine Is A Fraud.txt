Do not flinch, don't say a word, the war has been fought well
You are in the trenches, fighting your way to death

The divine is a fraud

The divine is a palpable fraud, a means to keep the rows in check
You are in the trenches, fighting your way to death

The divine is a fraud

Man derives a meaning for life, not from a divine mandation
In this illusion of meaningfulness there is no right or wrong

You have the ability to weigh, to know what's good, what's bad
Do not run from the truth, do not transfer responsibility

The absurd notion of meaning, in this frame of reference
You were in the trenches, fighting your way to death

Man derived a meaning from life, not from a divine mandation
in this illusion of meaningfulness there is no right or wrong
