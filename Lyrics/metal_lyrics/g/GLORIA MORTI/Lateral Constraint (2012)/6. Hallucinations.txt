Where is this all headed? Fire and brimstone to swallow the Earth
Nothing to gain, nothing to lose, pillar or smoke that obscures your sight

Gazing with your tunneled vision
you try to find meaning and explanation
And no matter what you do the blood won't come off

Brake off the chains of humanity
Free yourself from the shackles, proclaim!
You are not predetermined in existence
Embrace the sigh between deaths, proclaim!

The fallacy of humanity lies in what we all believe
In what we believe about ourselves and life
It is engraved deep into our minds and thoughts
The only way to be truly free is to proclaim what's ours

The unfathomable consequence
Of our willingness to be consumed

Delusion to contort us in the time of need
Misconception to guide our children to the path
Chimers to keep us from understanding
Mirage to suck us into the vortex

Break off the chains of humanity
Free yourself from the shackles, proclaim!
You are not predetermined in existence
Embrace the sigh between deaths
HalluciNations! One death to end it all, because
Only one death to spare
