When the shockwave burns you all
You realize that you lived solely for you
Nothing is going to redeem the life you have lived, in vain
I will kneel down on your forgotten grave
With a smile that never touched this face
And I will let my voice be heard
I'll bring the truth to the ones willing to listen

It's too late to start the never-ending
Argument about your place in the cosmos
You just don't understand that the
Universe is not made with you in mind
Too late to start counting the right and wrong
In your meaningless existence
Life, death nor omniverse do not owe you anything, not a thing

What the hell have you done to the Earth?
It doesn't feel like home anymore
Polluting for reasons of pure idiocy
Pouring death to oceans for your own gain

One life to spare, one life to make things right
One death to end it all, because, only one death to spare

You are meaningless, you just don't matter
Live with that in mind, stop living solely for your ego

The aesthetics of self hyperbole
Finding meanings from meaningless places
Trying to make yourself count by asserting
Notions of origin and final direction
The universe is going to end in heat
Death without your thoughts in sight
All ends, nothing is going to get better
Life simply closes her eyes

What the hell have you done to the Earth?
It doesn't feel like home anymore
Polluting for reasons of pure idiocy
Pouring death to oceans for your own gain

One life to spare, one life to make things right
One death to end it all, because, only one death to spare
