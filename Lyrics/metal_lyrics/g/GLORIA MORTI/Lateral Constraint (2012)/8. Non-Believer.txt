I bring forth my inmost convictions
The facts open for anyone to see
The truth lies in what can be shown
There is no metaphysics to be known

When I die I will not fight thru
When I die I'll just return to the cycle

But I'll have the patience
The patience to console myself with grief

As a much wiser man once said:
"I do not fear death, I was dead for billions
And billions of years before I was born
And had not suffered the slightest
Inconvenience from it"

When I die I will not fight thru
When I die I'll just return to the cycle

I am the non-believer, I am the anti-theist
I believe only in things that are true
I am the non-believer, I am the anti-theist
I will live my one and only life for me alone

There is room for awe and wonder
But only inside the life we are living
I will not fight truth or love outside
The only true meaning is to be found inside

When I die I will not fight thru
When I die I'll just return to the cycle

But I'll have the patience
The patience to console myself with grief
