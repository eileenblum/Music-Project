Torn from death to malevolence, bound to an existence in chains
A heartbeat in the history of the universe, here only to suffer and fade

Freedom is a projection

Death will always rest his hands on our shoulders
Whispering the ancient words, blowing deliverance on our distress
Finally freeing us from restraints

Freedom is a projection

Slaves to their will, slaves to their system
Slaves to our masters, slaves to existence

The sky fills with birds, covering the dawn
When the night was finally about to refract
Bond between grief and hope shrivels

The fortune, free from restraints

Freedom was a projection

Slaves to their will, slaves to their system
Slaves to our masters, slaves to existence
