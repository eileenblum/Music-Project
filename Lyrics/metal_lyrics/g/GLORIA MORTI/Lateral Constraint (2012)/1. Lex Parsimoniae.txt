This is where I stand, hopes and false beliefs are
A gateway that leads to suffering, it's time to say enough is enough

I will take my stand, morality is innate!

My message is a scientific one, there really is no god
Base your life on things that are not to ones you wish to be

Show me a moral act that only a believer can make
There is no case for faith to proclaim morality
In these times when tolerance is dead, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

I will take my stand, morality is innate!

Occams razor, the probability, think for yourself, do not bend
Scrutinize, do not take for granted, don't take part in the indoctrination

I will take my stand, morality is innate!

My message is a scientific one, there really is no God
Base your life on things that are not to ones you wish to be
