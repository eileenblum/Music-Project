From death I borrow the notion, we must fight to be human
Blood must flow like in my dreams
We must drown ourselves in it's cold hue

Our only true God is war, cleansing, making room
Death to validate and to undo, life to overcome and to exploit

Devour - your existence
Consume - your fellow man
Utilize - the means
Die - and be forgotten

From life I borrow the question, why must we fight to be human?
There is no human nature, our leaders define our thoughts

Our only true God is war, cleansing, making room
Death to validate and to undo, life to overcome and to exploit
