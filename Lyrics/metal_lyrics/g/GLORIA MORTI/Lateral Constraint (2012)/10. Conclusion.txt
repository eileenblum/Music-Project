Can you see what is wrong with the picture?
You live in an illusion
Trying to inject the world with your meaning
Never giving a single thought

Rid the hallucinations and Gods, we need to live for the truth
For in truth lies progress, for in truth we shall breath again

Religion is man made, and we must free ourselves
The system is shattering in front of our eyes
We need to choose the next step wisely

Those who offer false consolation are false friends
We'll need to start breathing again
Shake of the chains form your children's future
We'll need to bring down the lateral constraint

Keep on using the resources, live for your ego
Your children will pay, they'll pay for the constraint

Religion is man made and we must free ourselves
The system is shattering in front of our eyes
We need to choose the next step wisely

Those who offer false consolation are false friends
We'll need to start breathing again
Shake of the chains from your children's future
We'll need to bring down the lateral contraint
