Organized machinery to feed of the unfortunate
No mercy, no thought, blame is on the ones who suffer
Out from sight, out of mind, keep on grinding
Don't lose sleep, you haven't done anything wrong

Ants marching with lines perfectly in check
Marching to a beat with no-one in charge
Do not reorganize, do not think
March to the beat with yourself in mind

Close-minded and ill-suited a cancer to the planet
We have gone too far, too far from the truth

You'll need to sleep, you'll need to kill
You'll need to regress, you'll need to follow

Sleep, kill and follow you mindless fools
You think you are just in a waiting room
Ready to be taken up to the heavens
Like your life really weighed something

Close-minded and ill-suited a cancer to the planet
We have gone too far, too far from the truth

You'll need to sleep, you'll need to kill
You'll need to regress, you'll need to follow
