You pathetic beings, claiming a farse of an intelligentia
No intelligence can co-exist with suffering
Mere ants in the vast ocean of cooling nothingness

I will not tolerate! Murder to make a point!
Take a stand and pile the bodies, we must no tolerate!

The first act in demanufacturing "intelligence"
There is no room for us both

You deluded animals, claiming a false sense of hope
No intellect can grow with suffering
Mere apes fighting for reasons drained from existence

I will not tolerate! Murder to make a point!
Take a stand and pile the bodies, we must no tolerate!

Throat slit as a means to inform the blind of modern mans stupidity
The true nature of humanity hidden to false hope and empty promises
Spread chaos and suffering, rape, murder and tear apart!
Fight fire with fire, spilled blood to cleanse the Earth

I will not tolerate! Murder to make a point!
Take a stand and pile the bodies, we must no tolerate!

Throat slit as a means to inform the blind of modern mans stupidity
The true nature of humanity hidden to false hope and empty promises
Spread chaos and suffering, rape, murder and tear apart!
Fight fire with fire, spilled blood to cleanse the Earth

Primum non nocere!

Throat slit as a means to inform the blind of modern mans stupidity
The true nature of humanity hidden to false hope and empty promises
Spread chaos and suffering, rape, murder and tear apart!
Fight fire with fire, spilled blood to cleanse the Earth
