From an unsightly dream
To draw a circle in dissonance
I'll burn the glass once more
And trust myself as sand 

Death, Fear, Chaos, Fire

The I will wither and die 
When reaching for the blood
At last we'll get to merge
The two worlds into one

Death, Fear, Chaos, Fire

Death, Cleaning the blade
Fear, fueling the hate
Chaos, drawing the lines
Fire, clearing the path

And nothing will disorient the chimeral form
A serpent's tail on a human figure

Like a dream, tongues slit
The chaos will serve as fire
Thru the ages, like a dream
The blood will serve as fire

Death, Fear, Chaos, Fire

Perversely aroused
From separating the soul
I'll then turn the glass once more
And trust myself as sand
