A flower; to symbolize life
A human skull; to symbolize death
An hourglass; to symbolize time
Such is the snake gnawing its tail

I keep cutting until it no longer screams
Till I hear a soft moan
Driving the knife thru with the most beautiful sound
Like a soft wind blowing

The thing tries to struggle with its last remaining strength
Replaced by lust, no more necrophobia

Dheu; the process, act, condition of dying
Dheu; when all flesh gets rotted away
Dheu; the process, act, condition of dying
Dheu; when all flesh gets rotted away

The termination of bonds
Beginning of something more satisfying
No more necrophobia
As I slowly push myself
First in, and then out

In mourning
Eternal oblivion
Death is a process
Not an event

Biochemical cycle
Detritivores
The concept of death
Permanent and irreversible
