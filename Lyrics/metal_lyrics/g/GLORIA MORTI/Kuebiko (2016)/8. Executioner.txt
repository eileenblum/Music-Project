The complete absence of good
An opposite of all things divine
I am feeding on murder and tears
Psychotically fascinated with death

Torture
Murder
Suffocation
Taphophobia

Morality is relative, illusory
Good is what I consider useful
Evil is only what hinders me
All atrocity are by definition righteous

Asphyxia
Dehydration
Starvation
Taphephobia

All acts of dishonour shall be buried alive
The most awful way to depart
Trapped in total darkness
No room to move
Will to live replaced by extreme panic

I am the one who deals the justice
I'll decide if you should live or die
Evil is only what hinders me
All atrocities are by definition righteous
