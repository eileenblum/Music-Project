Death must be a cold place
But anything is better this
So off you go loved one
Godspeed, you won't be forgotten

To ascend a mountain slowly

For I will do
what is right
I will thus end
the distress
And we'll all be
We'll be saved
We will all be
saved from the suffering

Lingchi, ascending the mountain slowly
Lingchi, death by a thousand cuts
Lingchi, tied to a wooden frame
Lingchi
Lingchi, begin by putting out the eyes
Lingchi, three thousand incisions
Lingchi, genitals, ears, nose, tongue
Lingchi

Ascending the mountain slowly
Three days of cutting

Lingchi, opium to keep from fainting
Lingchi, to amplify the suffering
Lingchi, desecrated body in afterlife
Lingchi
Lingchi, separating the flesh from the bones
Lingchi, waiting for the decapitation
Lingchi, cuts leading to bliss
Lingchi

Ascending the mountain slowly
Three days of cutting
