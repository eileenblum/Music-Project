Drink the vile blood of the dead
I am no longer human
I have become death
In me joy and love intertwine

I'll replace hope with hope
Taking your body and mind
As I slowly take out the unborn
Forcing you to feed on your scion

The one who gives
The one to lift the shadows
Come to me, step to the light
I'll replace your god with mine

Bodies
Piled
Rotten 
Flesh

Slowly pushing the blade in
Feminine scream like stroke of the harp
Licking the infected wound
Impure thoughts free from the mind

Necro-
Pedophilist
Licking 
Skin

I'll replace hope with hope
Taking your body and mind
As I slowly pull out the unborn
Forcing you to feed on your scion
