Stained / Infinite / Bleak / Muted
The smell of emptied bodies
is wrapping me to its firm embrace
mesmerized by my morbid self beneath
I see it before my eyes
and kneel down to its nature
A man has a right to take  
when and how he pleases
Suffer and destroy
Erase and perfect
Therefore I am the truth
For this is why I am God

Disembodied mind
Timeless cause
Simple and mechanic
Causal event controlled by time

Imagine how she must have begged him
Imagine how she must have pleaded
Imagine for how long
Imagine how she must have prayed

How she must've beseeched heaven
Imagine, for twenty four years
And no, no answer at all nothing, nothing!
A steady stream of desecrated bodies
will sweep through my everlasting grace
Unbound by my morbid self beneath
You'll feel it inside your wounds
And be muted by its nature
A god has a right to give
when and how he pleases
