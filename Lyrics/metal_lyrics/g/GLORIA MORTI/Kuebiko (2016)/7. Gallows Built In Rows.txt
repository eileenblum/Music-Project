A road built by hate and paved with indifference
Men forced to dig their own graves

Abstract hallucinations, purely ideological
Myths that confine and kill, grounded in imagination

The vomit-inducing smell of burned bodies
Forcefully methodically murdered

Frozen, desecrated, sewn together
Burnt whole

Gallows built in rows
Hanged
Until they stink
Untied
Next batch strung up
Until cleansed

Frozen, desecrated, sewn together
Burnt whole

If there was a god
She would have to beg
for our forgiveness
