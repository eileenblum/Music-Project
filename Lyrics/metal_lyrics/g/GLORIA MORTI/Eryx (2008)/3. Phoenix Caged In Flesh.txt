The dread seems eternal
Each dawn mirroring
A paradise for castrated sheep

As if born again
Mind seeks to consciousness
Each and every day
Like a sick little phoenix
Shrouded in darkness
Tailored from the shreds of its wings

Tears fail to smother flames
Of phoenix caged in flesh

Buried alive to this wretched body
Banal days drag onward
A mere withering rose
Reminding of life about to end

A flesh bound phoenix dragging crippled wings
Travel sightless west of Gehenna

The cycle runs endlessly
