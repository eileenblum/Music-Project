A piece of ethereal Eden
Injected into body
Projecting false images
Of wings no longer vital
Flesh grows fractured
But the mind seeks more
Onward to portals
That lead beyond meaning

Synthetic Eden
Synthetic Demons
A veil of confusion
Ensnared in burning flesh
Acquire a taste for manmade paradise

Snow of the drifters
Escort the grey mourners
Who journey across the haze
Drenched in liquid obedience
