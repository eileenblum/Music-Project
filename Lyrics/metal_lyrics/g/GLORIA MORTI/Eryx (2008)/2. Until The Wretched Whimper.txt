Prepare for war

The seas spat terror to our midst
Whom we must defy
For the sake our lands
And that which we perceive righteous
Our homes are taken by robbery
The spared induced to flames
Forced to take on the assailants
And that which we perceive sacrilegious

Our streets are swarming of foe
Contagious and foul
The fiends have been offered
The liberating fire of the Dragunov

Until their hopes are broken
And their worthless lives removed
These spirits linger
Until the wretched whimper
Seek no shelter from our homes
Seek no home from this land
We return fire
Until the wretched whimper

They came in many
Like pestilence
To contaminate our gardens
To feed on our orchards
But to be hopelessly slain
Like the vermin they are
