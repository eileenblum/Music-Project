Admidst whispering spirits
Chaotic madness conspires
Seeping into light
Poisoning the Seraphs

Archangels lie torn now
Carpenters have ceased to rebuild
Hopelorn infant weeps
In a rain of bloodied feathers

Haunted
Imparted of greater sadness
I find myself howling at the wind
Forsaking that little left of light

Across vast gravelands
Past the burning metropolis
Upon the plains of consciousness
Murdering elegies resound

Grant me the strength
To have these voices bemuted
Death to bring me silence
End of the whispering
