Welcome home
To the set tables of famine
Here, where all but fear fails
The suffering is perpetual

A path paved in carrions
An endless southward spiral
Here, where little hope resides
The shadows have no mercy
The god forsaken space
An abode of torment
Here, the laws are that of anarchy
In the presence of no greater beast

The saddened are sentenced here
To serve forgotten kings

The travellers burn their feet
Upon the sands of Hinnom
As the sleep-devouring snakes trail their wake
Within the boundless valley of lamentation

Welcome home
To the set tables of famine
Here, where all but fear fails
The suffering is perpetual
Here, where the remaining debris of hope reside in Death
