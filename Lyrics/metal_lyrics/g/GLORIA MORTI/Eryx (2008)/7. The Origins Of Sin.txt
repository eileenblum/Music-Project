Hidden beneath a thousand snakes
Lies an imitated truth
Bio-mechanical messiah
Man-made god

It is awake again, the brutality
The same aimless echo of pain
Creating a distortion
Destroying all hope

Sacrificed truth
Nothing compared to the gain
The Origin
Too shortsighted to be forgiven
Too ignorant to be understood
The Origin

Bio-mechanical messiah
Man-made god
I want to watch you suffer
I want to watch you fall
