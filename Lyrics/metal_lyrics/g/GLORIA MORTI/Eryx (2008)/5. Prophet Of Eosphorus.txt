I am salvation, bearer of light
I am destruction, the final word

Temporary state of existence
A hell rotating backwards
Burning long before damnation
Repeating the errors

"I am a messenger of Eosphorus"

Only the destination matters
The journey is irrelevant
Mere guidance towards solace
Correcting the errors

Mutilated bodies hung to rest
Liberated from the constant seeking of purpose

In killing is deliverance
Only death ends the suffering
In killing is deliverance
Only death gives the salvation

You will always rely on me
Swearing in the name of cruelty
Forgetting your name
Burying your beliefs
