You watching TV with your parents
The whole house starts to shake
The walls are falling the floor is crumbling
You think it's an earthquake

You should see the look on your face
When you find out what it is
The windiws are exploding
And your guts gives mom a kiss

Rushes out from hell with more violent speed than light
Legions of satanic noise comes for you tonight

The hellstorm

The hellstorm drawn across the land
And leave a trail of death
Satan syas: "Listen to metal
Or taste the hellstorm's breath!"

You try to find a metal record
You cry out in despair
At last you find one, but it's no use
Your mom has cut your hair!

Join the line of execution, sonn you'll detonate
Death by Gehennah is the false one's fate

The hellstorm
