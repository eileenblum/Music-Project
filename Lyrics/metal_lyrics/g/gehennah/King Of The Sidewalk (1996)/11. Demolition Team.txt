We are starting a riot tonight
Ready for some action, prepared for a fght
Asking for trouble, we want the thrill
You better stay away 'cause we're ready to kill

Demolition team, we're so fucking mean
Ain't never gonna betray our scene
No, we've no glass but we will kick your ass
If you don't join our heavy metal mass

We're getting wilder for each day
If you wanna live, then get out of our way
Won't accept no disco, won't accept no dance
We're to trendy assholes, we are heavy metal fans
