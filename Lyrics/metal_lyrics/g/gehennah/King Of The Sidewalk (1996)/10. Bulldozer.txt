100 on the rightscale
Maximum volume is a must
Don't care if we go to jail
Cause in metal we trust

We'll run you over, we'll run you over
We'll run you over like a fuckung Bulldozer

A loud fucking tone
Faster than lightning, faster than sound
A big machine of stone
Hammers you into the ground

We'll run you over, we'll tear yoou down
Like a Bulldozer we'll crush your town

We'll crush your town
