You feel your hair with hair-mousse, you fill it with shampoo
We'll crush your face with crowbar, that's what we're gonna do

You exercise and run, you wanna be in shape
But when you're outside jogging your girlfriend we will rape

Tough guys don't look good

We're long-haired and we're dirty, we're ungly and we smell
But if you're in our way we're gonna give you hell

Tooth brush is unknown to us, the dentist cries in fear
And instead of doing exercise we drink a lot of beer

Tough guys don't look good

We drink whiskey like water, we're drinking wine and booze
And if you wanna fight us you're gonna f**kin' lose

So if you not one of us, you're our enemy
You'll wake up in a hospital, that's where you're gonna be

Tough guys don't look good
