Rock'n'roll stud
Heavy metal blood
Guts of steel, it's for real
A touch of death your feel

Killing command
Do as we demand
Soon you'll die, don't ask why
Kiss your ass goodbye

Bang your heads for satan

Come on you wings
Whores and pimps
Crash your heads against the wall
The whole world soon shall fall

Kicked in the teeth
Attacked from beneath
Bite the bullet, taste the sound
Drumk until you hit the ground

Bang your heads for satan
