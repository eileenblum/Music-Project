I went to the local bar and got pissed again
That's where they throw me out every now and then
Too drunk to behave, unconsious on the floor
Last night was of course not different at all

I drank to much to walk and I punched instead of talk
That must be a reason why they threw me out so soon

HUNGOVER - post-alcoholic living dead
HUNGOVER - the room is spinning around my head
HUNGOVER - shaking in the pool of sweat
HUNGOVER - you bet!

Punding headache, the morning after is here
Loss of memory, drank too many beers
Don't know where I am, again I slept in my clothes
Have to pick some dried vomits from my nose

The cash I had is gone, don't know what's said or done
I only have some flashbacks and a head that doesn't fit

HUNGOVER - post-alcoholic living dead
HUNGOVER - the room is spinning around my head
HUNGOVER - shaking in the pool of sweat
HUNGOVER - you bet!

I wish this day would pass on really quick
Can't even think of booze without feeling sick
Disgusted by the thought of tasting beer
But the thirst is back when the afternoon is here

My hands still shake like leafs, I need alcoholic relief
Now the thirst sets in again and I accept it with a smile

HUNGOVER - post-alcoholic living dead
HUNGOVER - the room is spinning around my head
HUNGOVER - shaking in the pool of sweat
HUNGOVER - you bet!

HUNGOVER - post-alcoholic living dead
HUNGOVER - the room is spinning around my head
HUNGOVER - shaking in the pool of sweat
HUNGOVER - you bet!
