When I am coming to your place, babe, I am feeling low
But you've got the thing that makes me go
I am talking six icecold beers that can satisfy my thirst
You know when I am having problems, babe, I wanna be nursed

I know I can always lean on you my Six-pack Queen
You're not the cutest thing that I've ever seen but you're still my Six-pack
queen

Don't think I am in love, babe, but I love beer
And when that sixpack's gone I am leaving, that's crystal clear
These wonderful gifts that you give me you know I can't repay
And if you weren't so goddamn ugly, I would marry you someday

I know I can always lean on you my Six-pack Queen
You're not the cutest thing that I've ever seen but you're still my Six-pack
queen
