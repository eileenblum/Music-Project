The poser spends his life just polishing his act
Beat him!
His suntanned face is made to hurt, convince him that's the fact
Beat him!
He's not a friend or brother, this time he'll face our crowd
Beat him!
Teach him that on our streets posers aren't allowed
Beat him!

Kick him in the face, kick him in the nuts
Kick him in the nose, kick him in the guts
Beat him in the teeth, beat him to the floor
And if he still moves, then beat him some more
BEAT THAT POSER DOWN!

A poser's personality won't wash away with soap
Beat him!
You have to hurt him really good, then there might be some hope
Beat him!
Chase him though the alleys, through ever street in town
Beat him!
In the name of metal, beat that poser down!

Kick him in the face, kick him in the nuts
Kick him in the nose, kick him in the guts
Beat him in the teeth, beat him to the floor
And if he still moves, then beat him some more
BEAT THAT POSER DOWN!

Come here little poser, wipe away your tears
Beat him!
A wise man said something that you've just got to hear
Beat him!
"-A really good bashing is what poser needs...-"
Beat him!
And you know what? We all agreed!
Beat him!

Kick him in the face, kick him in the nuts
Kick him in the nose, kick him in the guts
Beat him in the teeth, beat him to the floor
And if he still moves, then beat him some more
BEAT THAT POSER DOWN!
