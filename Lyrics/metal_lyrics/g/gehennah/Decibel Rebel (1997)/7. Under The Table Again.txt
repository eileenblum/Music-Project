People tell us we are wrong just because our hair is long
They say we're lazy we should grow up, to cut out hair and work in some shop
They're always telling us we're wasting precious years
But our only waste of time is when we don't drink some beer

We're under the table again
We handle our drinking as man
We're lying everywhere with vomits in our hair
We're under the table again

I made myself some alcohol, I drank quite much and I lost control
I drank two litres, maybe three, then I woke up at the emergency
They think I'm a loser, a drunk who'll never learn
By though my liver slowly shrinks it's none of their concern

We're under the table again
We handle our drinking as man
We're lying everywhere with vomits in our hair
We're under the table again

I wake up with some food in my hair and wonder what it's doing there
Hungover stinking cigarettesmoke, the mourning after ain't no joke
Hardrockers and bottles in a pile of the floor
Wake'em up it's time to drink some more

We're under the table again
We handle our drinking as man
We're lying everywhere with vomits in our hair
We're under the table again
