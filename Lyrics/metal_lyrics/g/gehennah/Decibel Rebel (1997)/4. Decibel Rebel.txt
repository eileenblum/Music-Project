Cruising for a bruising, I am coming through
No light at the end of the tunnel but that's nothing new

I am a beer drinker, babe, and a hellraiser too
In league with the devil so whatcha gonna do?

I am a decibel rebel, coming for you!

I am on my way on the highway going down
Nothing can stop me, I am taking this town

I am a beer drinker, babe, and a hellraiser too
In league with the devil so whatcha gonna do?

I am a decibel rebel, coming for you!

Some think I am an angel in a torn and dirty gown
But most of them will tell you I am meanest one around

I am a beer drinker, babe, and a hellraiser too
In league with the devil so whatcha gonna do?

I am a decibel rebel, take you for a screw!
