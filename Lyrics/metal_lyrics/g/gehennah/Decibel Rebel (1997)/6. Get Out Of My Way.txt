I see you and your disgusting looks with your boyfriend on the streets every day
Now you're taking up space in my favourite bar, trying to get one night lay

Your ugly face is all I need to make me sick for days
But you're even dummer than you look, so get the hell out of my way
Get out of my way!

I say: Stand by your stupid man, bitch 'cause you ain't ever gonna find another
You say you wanna try to get some action tonight, well I tell you don't even
bother

Your ugly face is all I need to make me sick for days
But you're even dummer than you look, so get the hell out of my way
Get out of my way!

If there was just a little inch of pride behind that fucked up face you've got
You'd make an already too long story by ending it with a rifle- shot

Your ugly face is all I need to make me sick for days
But you're even dummer than you look, so get the hell out of my way
Get out of my way!
