Since the first beers we drank they knew we were no saints
Our parents though we were their pride but we've really proved we ain't
We went downhill so long ago we're the outcast no one likes
The grades we got when we left school said we are the Antichrist

We set out goals at early age there was metal and alcohol
Nothing else would interest us, we were born outside the law
The criminal records speaks our names we're documented in their ink
And we've got the band where we belong that's a good reason to drink

If they say "sober", then we say "NO!"
Non alcoholics stay away from our shows
They can shove it cause we love it
WE LOVE ALCOHOL

We spent our childhood in a classromm where we felt displaced
We were born to form this band the whole schooltime was a waste
Don't want no worthless 9-5, that's not the life we seek
We won't get rich on rock'n'roll but we have fulfilled our dreams

If they say "sober", then we say "NO!"
Non alcoholics stay away from our shows
They can shove it cause we love it
WE LOVE ALCOHOL

Out of cash and out of tune some would say we've falled
But still we never compromise cause we are not for sale
Can't afford no proper gear since we've bought alcohol
Well nothing's ever easy when you've chosen rock'n'roll

If they say "sober", then we say "NO!"
Non alcoholics stay away from our shows
They can shove it cause we love it
WE LOVE ALCOHOL
