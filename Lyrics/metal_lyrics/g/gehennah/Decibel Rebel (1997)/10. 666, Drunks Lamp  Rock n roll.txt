Our hair might be greasy but we don't give a shit
Cause every song we ever write is bound to be a hit
Maybe we look dirty and might not smell that nice
But you must give us credit for the way we attract flies

666, drunks and rock'n'roll
Street metal, fight and alcohol
666

You think we're responcible and don't think very clear
While you stay super for the gig we drink a crate of beer
You think what we will be too drunk and maybe that's true
But when it all comes around, we're louder than you

We're drunk we're loud we damage the crowd!

666, drunks and rock'n'roll
Street metal, fight and alcohol
666

When the gig is over it's time to drunk for real
We drink until we break our bones, then we drink to heal
We storm the streets, creates a scene, then we get thrown in jail
Well we can afford it, OSMOSE will pay the ball

666, drunks and rock'n'roll
Street metal, fight and alcohol
