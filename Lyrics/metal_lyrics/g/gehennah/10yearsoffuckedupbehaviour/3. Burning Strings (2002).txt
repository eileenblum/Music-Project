The lights turns out
But not for long
Soon the amps will explode
And you will burn to our song

Your parents didn't want you to go
But you where stupid enough to come to our show
Now you're burning in volume-hell
And you don't really feel too well

Burnin' Strings - Ears do bleed
Burnin' Strings - Total speed

Special delivery just for you
You'll scream in pain, yeah that is true
Leather, spikes and thunder in our stacks
Just wait and see our Metal attack!

Burnin' Strings - Ears do bleed
Burnin' Strings - Killing speed

Burning barb wire convulsion: Stringburner

Burnin' Strings - Ears do bleed
Burnin' Strings - Is what we breed

Improved necroripping: Stringburner
