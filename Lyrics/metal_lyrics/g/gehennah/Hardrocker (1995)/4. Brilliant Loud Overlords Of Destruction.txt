My life is metal, chaos and death
You can come along, but you may loose your breath
I worship the dark one, I spit on your god
Don't need your friendship, but I need a Bud (weiser)

I've got a chainsaw
Behind my back
You better watch out or I'll break your neck

Brilliant loud overlords of destruction

You better watch out when I'm on the loose
Chaos and metal, destruction and booze
Don't care if I'm right, don't care if I'm wrong
This is my life, the way of the strong
