You were so happy living in paradise
You felt so good your religion wasn't lies
But it's something I want to tell
Suddenly your paradise turns into an exploding HELL

Bombraid overparadise
Can you feel the heat
Bombraid overparadise
Christian flesh turns into dead meat

The skeletons in leather fucking attack
We bomb we burn and we crack
We bomb away the christian race
And the biggest bomb we place in god's face

Bombraid overparadise
