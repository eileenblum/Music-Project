Wandering in the breath of destruction
Wearing the skin of the beast
Watching through the eye of the vampire
Bleeding the blood of the goat

Shrill crushing volume, a sabbath on stage
Thousands of decibels, screaming in pain
Under the flag of old metal we march
This is Gehennah, distorted and loud

Blood metal - those who turn the other cheek
Blood metal - we just stab in their backs
Blood metal - we give the destiny to the weakings
Blood metal - with our volume we can kill
Through the stacks

We're the equinox of cruelty and chaos
We give the deluge of sound
Volcanic hammers beats harder than war
Thousands of fuckin' bombs!
