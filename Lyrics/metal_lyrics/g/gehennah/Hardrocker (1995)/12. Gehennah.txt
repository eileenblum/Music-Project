The hellish noise becomes unbound
When the witching hammers sound
Unleashed powers of ancient force
Released with our metal as the source

No, no, my little boy
You can't escape, you satan's toy!
Look into the raging fire
Don't you feel a calling desire

Little children walking
Through flames
Sacrifice the Moloch the strange Gehennah!

Forced by apostate Israelites
To still the monsters appetite
Brought to life at the world's dawn
In Hinnom's valley we were spawn
