I am the wolf
I am the beast
I eat the flesh
Of the deceased

Dark, in the frosty night
Calm, the moon's my only light
Transformed, in my greatest mood
Hungry, and I'm looking for some food

Smell, the smell of human flesh
Smell, the smell's so fuckin' fresh
Hunting, the human little child
Ooh yeah, I think I'm going wild

Screams, the human run away
Angry, I think I'm gonna slay
