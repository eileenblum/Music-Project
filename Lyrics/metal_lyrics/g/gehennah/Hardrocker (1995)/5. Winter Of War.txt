I'm a warrior, a man of hate
Standing in the snow, awaiting the battle
My axe is thirsty, it wants blood
I am ready, it wants blood

Winter of war

Now is the time for my enemies to die
Now is the time, I feel so high
No mercy, I'll kill you all
I will win, I will never fall

Winter of war

Now it's over, the snow is red
I am calm, my axe is fed
Longing for the next time I'll kill
Feels so good, gives me a thrill
