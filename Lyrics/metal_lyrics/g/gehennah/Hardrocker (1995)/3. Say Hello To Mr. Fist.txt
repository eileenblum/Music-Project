If you wear short hair you better beware
This is metal warfare
I'll make you bleed that's what I need

I gonna crush your jaw just because I'm raw
Learn the metal law

Your legs I will chop
If you listen to pop

Say hello to Mr.Fist in your face

In a bed you will lie in the mirror you cry
You could as well die

Your face I fuckin' broke
I'll laugh till I choke

Say hello to Mr.Fist in your face
