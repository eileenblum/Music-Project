I'm here to drag you in the dirt, kick you where it really hurts
No matter how you kneel and beg, a crushing foot between your legs
I saw you drinking from my glass, that's why I mst rip your ass
My fist awaits, my throat was dry, I smash my knuckles in your eyes

A been in one hand, your teeth in the other
I haven't forgot when you stole from my bottle

There is hardwire where your children play, your family pays for your mistake
Your son is messed up really bad, your daughter's shouting for her dad
Your wimpy parents dressed in white, blown to bits by dynamite
Your wife lies beaten blue and raped, she's never gonna be the same (What a
shame, ha-ha!)

Your brothers shortcut discohair, made me throw him down the stairs
In a wheelchair he got trapped, now he's fucking handicapped
I'll atombomb your childhood town, burning down your neighboor's house
Your life is left in ruins now, as my boot is coming down
