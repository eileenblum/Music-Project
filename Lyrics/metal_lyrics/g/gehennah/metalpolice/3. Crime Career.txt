Sittin' here nothin' to do
Contemplating sniffin' glue
Got no job, got no cash
Feelin' like some fuckin' trash

I said that I got nothin' to do
And I'm gonna take it out on you

CRIME CAREER the way I gotta go

Dealin' drugs, cashin' in
Screw the system, the way to win
Lovin' my career of crime
Takin' yours, make it mine

I said screw the system's the way to win
Fuck the police I'm cashin' in

CRIME CAREER the way to fuckin' go
