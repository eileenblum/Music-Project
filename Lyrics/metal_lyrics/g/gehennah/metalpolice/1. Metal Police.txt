I heard some rumours that was going around
That your "Metal" band is coming to town
But then I realized just what the hell you are
With your poser haircuts and your 7-stringed guitars

Saw you drag a keyboard up onstage
A sight that almost made me vomit with rage
When you pulled out that fancy 5-stringed bass
I knew for a fact we had to kick your ass

This is our streets and you should take our advice
You better beware we won't tell you twice
A shitstorm is coming to rid the disease
We are the METAL POLICE!

I heard you are sober and don't eat meat?
Well, that's the way to lose some teeth
You'll regret those expensive shoes
Your designer shirts and tribal tattoos

And that 6 minute song was a big mistake
Time to wipe that smile of your stupid face
We're the judge and jury and you're sentenced to die
Now there's no way you're leaving town alive

This is our streets and you should take our advice
You better beware because we won't tell you twice
A shitstorm is coming to rid the disease
We are the METAL POLICE!

We'll shove that keyboard down your throat
Throw you in the river to see if you float
Break both your knees and make you crawl
So everyone can see who's the fucking law

We are the METAL POLICE!
