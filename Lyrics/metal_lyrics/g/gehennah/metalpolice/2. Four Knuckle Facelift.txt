You got too many teeth in your stupid smile
You got too much sunshine in your ignorant eyes
But don't you worry, because the doctor is here
Gonna give you a treatment from ear to ear

FOUR KNUCKLE FACELIFT - UH!

I'm gonna fix that unbroken jaw
You'll look real funny, sucking food from a straw
That's how I work, I scar and I bruise
And I cash my checks in drugs and booze

FOUR KNUCKLE FACELIFT - UH!

The simple cure for your pretty-boy looks
Is a few of my heavy right handed hooks
Make you a laughing-stock, the joke of the town
You'll lose your fancy look, become an ugly clown

FOUR KNUCKLE FACELIFT - UH!
