[Music: Stringburned Lyrics: Violence]

It's Christmas morning and You're so glad
Gonna get some presents from Mom and Dad
You take a look under the Christmas tree
A very special present You now can see

The special present can't wait 'til later
In your excitement You rip off the paper
Suddenly You notice a very strange smell
It's from the present, You can tell

Merry Shitmas!

Santa's very special big surprise
A sausage of shit surrounded by flies
Merry shitmas, stupid child
This is what you get for being nice and mild

Very Merry Shitmas!

[The shitmas carol/Stringburner]

[Repeat verse 3]

Merry Shitmas!
