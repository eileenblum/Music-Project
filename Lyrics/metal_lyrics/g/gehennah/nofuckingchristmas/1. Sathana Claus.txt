[Music &amp; Lyrics: Ripper]

Christmas is here again filled with hope
The time of year to use the soap
A little boychild runs to open the door
But it leaves Him bleeding on the floor

Cause Father Christmas full of grace
Kicks the door into his face
It breaks his nose with the loudest sound
Yeah, father Christmas has come to town

Santa is drunk, Santa is out of control
Santa is drunk, Santa is out on parole

He doesn't care about christmas lists
And snotty children makes Him pissed
His only interest is drinking beerHe won't get sober, not this year

Santa is drunk, Santa is out of control
Santa is drunk, Santa is out on parole

Beware of Sathana Claus...Look out for Sathana Claus...

Look out!!!!!

[Chemical warfare against the soap/Stringburner]

With the whiskeybottle in His hand
He takes a bite from the family ham
He doesn't notice or doesn't care
And starts to shit in His underwear

The hairy legs turn to brown
His trousers changes shape
He laughs the family in the face
Cause he is not ashamed

Santa is drunk, Santa is out of control
Santa is drunk, Santa has jumped the parole

Christmas is over but not the booze
Don't care about jail, He's on the loose
Rudolf the reindeer has been shot
And virgin Mary was raped, that slut!

Take your time to heal your bones
You are a nervous wreck
But Santa knows where all of you live
And next year He'll be back!!!

Santa is drunk, Santa is out of control
Santa is drunk, Santa has jumped the parole
Sathana Claus
