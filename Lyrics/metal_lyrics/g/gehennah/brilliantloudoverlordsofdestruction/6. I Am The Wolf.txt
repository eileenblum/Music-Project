I am the wolf
I am the beast
I eat the flesh
of the deceased

Dark, in the frosty night
Calm, the moonÂ´s my only light
Transformed, in my greatest mood
Hungry, and IÂ´m looking for some food

I am the wolf
I am the beast
I eat the flesh
of the deceased

Smell, the smell of human flesh
Smell, the smellÂ´s so fuckinÂ´fresh

Hunting, the human little child
Ooh yeah, I think IÂ´m going wild

I am the wolf
I am the beast
I eat the flesh
of the deceased

[Children hunting: Stringburner - Ripper]

Screams, the humans run away
Angry, I think IÂ´m gonna slay
Hunger is the only thing I feel
Your flesh is for me the greatest meal

I am the Wolf!
