Chaos lives within our Metal, the Elders on our side
To kill all tightness is our mission, defening we fight
Disorted fuck shall crush your eardrum, Necrorip will slay
DonÂ´t dare to walk upon our path, Deathdrums leads the way

Chorus: Skeletons in Leather, march out of Sodom raise your hands
Sons of the Reaper, grant us the power and be our fans

Destruction, war and pestilence, nothing beats our load
A fist of steel strikes through your skull, your whole family explodes
Whores are sucking on our strings, bitches out of Hell
Who said our music should be clean, weÂ´ll never play it well

[Chorus]

Explosive Heat, War, Total Death, pain, Crushing Noise, Loud, Bestial Rock, All that we give you...

Dressed in black we live our lives and you canÂ´t do a shit
to make us slow down our riffs, piss of your feeble worms!
Short hair is what deny, we spit you in your ears
We are the poison in your veins and mercy we donÂ´t know

Satan sings our backing vocals, devils dance around
They bang their horned heads to the rhythm, the witching speed is bound
Watching from the burning stage, right into the flame
Soon the volume breaks it all, the roof comes down as rain

[Chorus]
