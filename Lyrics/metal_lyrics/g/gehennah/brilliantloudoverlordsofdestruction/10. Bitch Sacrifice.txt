Watch the candles burn
Watch 'em as I make you die
DonÂ´t care about your pleads for mercy
Don't care about the tears you cry

BITCH!

Watch the knife in my hands
Watch it, it will take your life
Your blood will float down the altar
This is a Bitch Sacrifice

FUCKIN' WHORE!

Demons will awake tonight, when virgin blood is spilled
Dark forces will come down tonight, when a bitch like you is killed

BITCH!

Now the time is here
The time for you to scream
Then I watch your ugly corpse
Oh, it makes me feel so mean

BITCH!
