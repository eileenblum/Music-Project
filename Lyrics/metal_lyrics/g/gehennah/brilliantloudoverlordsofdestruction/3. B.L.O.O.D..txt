My life is Metal, Chaos and Death
You can come along, but you may loose your breath
I worship the dark one, I spit on your god
DonÂ´t need your friendship, but I need my Bud(weiser)

[Pre Chorus:]
I've got a CHAIN SAW
Behind my back
You better back off
or IÂ´ll break your neck

[Chorus:]
Brilliant Loud Overlords Of Destruction

You better watch out when I'm on the loose
Chaos and Metal, destruction and booze
Don't care if I'm right. Don't care if I'm wrong
This is my life, the way of the strong

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]
