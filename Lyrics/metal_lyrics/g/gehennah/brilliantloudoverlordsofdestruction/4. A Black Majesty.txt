Swallowed by illusions
Separated from the past
My tomb is in your soul, but I will rise
Your mortal life is false

Find the path where you where meant to wander
Find the lake where you were meant to float
Taste the pleasures you deserve
Just close your eyes from the blindning light

I am the blackest of your secret dreams
I am the deepest of your fears
I am the wisdom that you hold but do not know
I am the true you

Behold! The kingdom you would rule
Behold! The black throne where you cold sit
You are a king
A Black Majesty!
