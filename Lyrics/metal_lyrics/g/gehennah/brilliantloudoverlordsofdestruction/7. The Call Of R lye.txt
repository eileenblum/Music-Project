Clawing... The dreams are stuck in my mind
Horrendous shapes of cyclopean kind
Chtulhu calls from inside his seal
Ripping in my head, oh Ã­t feels so real!

Though the pain makes me awake with screams
Something makes me long for the dreams
Dreams preparing for a new regin to be
Night after night HeÂ´s calling me

The Call From RÂ´Lye

Rising... Hazy visions of the city under sea
Which now is rising from itÂ´s seal
I know the Old Ones shall once more reign
Because I feel their power contained therein

Yeah, the pain makes me wake with screams
Yet something makes me long for the dreams
The dreams preparing for a new reign to be
Night after night HeÂ´s calling me

The Call From RÂ´Lys

I greet the dreams...
