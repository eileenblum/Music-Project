Wandering in the breath of Destruction
Wearing the skin of the beast
Watching through the eye of the vampire
Bleeding the blood of the goat

[Pre Chorus:]
Shrill crushing volume, a Sabbath on stage
Thousands of decibels, screaming in pain
Under the flag of old Metal we march
This is Gehenna, Distorted and Loud

[Chorus:]
Blood Metal - Those who turn the other cheek
Blood Metal - We just stab in their backs
Blood Metal - We give the destiny to the weaklings
Blood Metal - With our volume we can kill through the stacks

WeÂ´re the equinox of cruelty and chaos
We give the deluge of sound
Volcanic hammers beats harder than war
Thousands of fuckin' bombs!

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus 2x]
