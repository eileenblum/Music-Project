Executional missile launching: The Captain

Suddenly she stood there close to me
A woman too grotesque to even be
I felt quite dim, but I was still aware
That I was to drunk to see or care

I said: Baby, Metal is what I need
Not some bloody whore to feed
She looked at me with stupid eyes
Then I gave her my advice:

Piss off, I'm drinking... Piss off, or die

She didn't seem to understand what I had to tell
I simply said: I don't want you, so you can go to hell
I was born to play the highest level, living hard and loud
I am into Metal and forever to be proud

I said...

Piss off, I'm drinking... Piss off, or die
