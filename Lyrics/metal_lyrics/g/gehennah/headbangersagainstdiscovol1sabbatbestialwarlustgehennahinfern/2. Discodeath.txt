[performed by Gehennah]Outside a disco, the hour was late
Armed with a machinegun and full of hate
People inside are dancing rave
The death of those is what I crave

Discodeath, discodeath - The gasp you take is your last breath
Discodie, discodie - You're shaking loose, that's the reason why
Dancing rave, dancing rave - You're dancing rave into your grave
Having fun, having fun - I'm having fun with my machine gun

Disco party turns in to a bloodbath
You scream in pain, I just stand and laugh
I know you never will dance disco again
Metal - that's music for true men

[Chorus]

Outside a disco, the hour was late
Armed with a machinegun and full of hate
People inside are dancing rave
The death of those is what I crave

[Chorus]
