Each day, each night
I know you by my side
even only with your soul
and hope one day with your body
Glowing like a star you are my life's light!

Sublime - is the love for me - saint sympathy
Sublime - is the love you give - inside of me
Supreme - the way you chose - don't wanna lose
Supreme - the way chosen for me - I'm gonna keep!

Remember the old times together
even if it seems that you died in me
But now you're more alive than ever
Alive - your image and your warm touch
and the icon of Thy soul
breathes an even stronger call

I know one day I shall receive it
Someday I'll live our holy love!
Feelings hidden deep inside
Prayers for my saddest muse
surrounding me with love

Let me burn in heaven like fire
Take me under your wing
Hold me closer than air
and never let me go, forever!

"Tu esti cu mine, stii foarte bine ca voi ramane
Eu sunt cu tine, stii foarte bine ca vei ramane!"
