Dreaming about you, my love
Thinking about me, for you
Night by night I pray
for the way from the day
Who will come
Day by day I pray
for the silence of your heart
My guardian angel!

Oh, my God, be with me now
take my thought into the deep of my soul
Oh, my lord, open the gates of darkness
Show me the way to the land of the shadows!

"In numele Tatalui si al Fiului
si al Sfantului Duh, acum si pururea
si-n vecii vecilor,
Amin!"
