Riders of Hell and Heaven
Covering the Earth and Skies
With the shine and sharper wings
Lightings and fire from the eyes
On black and heavy horses
That they never look behind
Storm and thunders, Earth is shacking
When the black riders are passing!

Riders of Hell!!!

They ware named by the ancient ages
The apocalyptic Hell riders
Breaking the times of GOD
Riding against the land
Over the graves and seasons
Letting behind a tale
A tale of horror nightmares
And other stories about fear!

Riders of hell!!!

Fear despair, spoken by other legends
The apocalyptic hell riders
Screaming the song of evil
Flying against the lands
Under a full moon spells
Making to ring the bells
The bells of judgment day
They are the riders of...

Hell. Heaven

Angels... Please put the hands on me.
Riders... Please put the blades on them.
Angels... Please take the sins from me.
Riders... Please take the souls of them, right now!!!
