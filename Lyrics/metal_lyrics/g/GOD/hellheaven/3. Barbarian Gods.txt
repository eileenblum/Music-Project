I, I give to Gods, my soul, my faith.
I give to you my bloody divine love.
I, I give to Gods, my heart, my flesh.
I give to all of us... My blood!

Far away "The Land, Beyond the Forest"
The mountains are older
With highest forests of pines
Mountains are sharps like spikes.
Long time before civilization
Mountains are guardians
For the sacred places of sacrifices
The Mountains stays surrounds by fog!

Barbarian Gods, barbarian people
They sign the past with their bloody rituals
On the sacred altars from the mountains
Or the holy ancient battlefields!

Barbarian people, Barbarian Gods!

O sol eterno da beatitude divina
Nunca pode esconder a sua cara nas nuvens
O grande Deus da Luz
SÃ³ pode brilhar por seus guerreiros bÃ¡rbaros!

Bendis, the beauty Goddess of the moon
Gebeleizis, the cruel God of war
Zamolxis, the great God of the Gods
Kogaionon, the sacred mountain temple!!!
