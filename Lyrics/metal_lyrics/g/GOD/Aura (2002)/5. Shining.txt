Shining the day
Watching not to see
Feel the deepest feelings
You start to see the way

Opening your soul
Flying in the times
Find your own light
And return for good to life

Life...when death is raping, death is closing your...
Eyes...when release your eyes no longer see the...
Sky...when you feel your sky, your sky is in...
Time...when you''re searchin' still
....for what you seek and die!!!

You are my God, You are my light
You are my Lord, You are my life
You are my God, You are my light
You are my Lord, You are my real life!
