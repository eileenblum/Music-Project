I dig my grave in the stone of your soul
I'll rot inside your own flesh
you'll hear my cries filled with despair
and your hurt will fade with me...

Your body will feel the hollow call of death
fearful, you shall kiss my darkness
and your shade will come to pieces
among nights of loneliness....

Admirandvm, adorandvm, fascinas mysterivm
Sanctvs Devs, sanctvs fortis, sanctvs imortalis!

And out there, somewhere, it's going to rain
and I wish, I wish I were beyond
but my love still rains upon your heart
when darkness...darkness is the world

A sacred trill when you're in front of God
The religious bliss of recollection
The feeling of our own nothingness
As I am nothing...You're Everything!!!!

Admirandvm, adorandvm, fascinas mysterivm
Sanctvs Devs, sanctvs fortis, sanctvs imortalis!
