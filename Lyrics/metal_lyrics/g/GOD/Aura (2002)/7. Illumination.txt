You appeared my guiding light
Lonely star, eternal and immense
Strongly burning light
Showing the way to perfection

Embodies perfection of death
Death that will slowly come to us
Till we all gonna die
And others will replace us...

I feel a warmth that rises from me
Higher and higher
Being sealed together, forever
You belong to me and I belong to you
As we belong to deity
We are made for each other, forever!!!

This is God's will
And we will obey it
I am your God and you praise me passionately
You are my goddess and my guiding muse
We are unique in universe
We are one body and soul
Belonging one to each other!!!

With a blazing sinless crown
Upon the path of those with no sin
It is as the blinding light
Among our decadence's darkness
Spread and burn, angelic spark
Errupt and rise, divine Aura!
