You came from far beyond me
From far beyond seasons and leaves
From beyond my pagan dreams
And my own spoken desire...

You came from a place
Where my thoughts never took shape
From far beyond failed illusions
From a "beyond" I could never imagine

A place where I thought I was dead
You were coming...and true your coming was
From an imagined apocalypse towards happiness!

Inside you I'd like to get lost
And be reborn as I never thought I could be
You were walking...I believed you did not walk
You were watching me...I believed your eyes were shut
You were smiling...I couldn't believe you were crying
You were tempting...tempting me into deadly lust

On the path of the passing autumns
You were coming with my God...
Your coming was the autumn of my life
Solitude you brought, the darkness in my eyes
When nothing belongs to me
And i belong to nothingness!
