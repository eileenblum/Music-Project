Burning flames,
Frightening forests...
The tribes of the frightening forests!

Through the sharpest spears,
Through the burning flames,
We are sharing our blood,

Flying to the skies,
Guided by the stars,
Purifying our souls!

We are proud to die
On the battlegrounds
In front of our enemies,

Immortal we are,
Striking with the faith,
In front of our gods!

Burning flames,
Frightening forests...
The tribes of frightening forests,
Tribes of warriors...

Zal Mox!

We are the men of the Carpathians!
We are the mountains of the ancient Dacia!
We are the warriors, we are the barbarians!
We are the Dacians, we are the Draco!
