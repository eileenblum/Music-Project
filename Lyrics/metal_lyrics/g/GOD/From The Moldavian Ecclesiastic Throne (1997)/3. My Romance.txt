From the darkness of the cloudless sky
From the light of the gloomy heaven
In the lasting ... within me!
From the purling of the flowing waters
In the purling of the flowing waters,
From the sigh of the falling leaves
In the sigh of the falling leaves,
From the tears of the weeping willow
In the tears of the weeping willow,
From the song of the rooming birds
In the song of the rooming birds,
From the hearts of the angelical choir
In the hearts of the angelical choir,
From the soul of the wondering mortal
In the soul of the wondering mortal,
My pain ... is my romance
My romance ... is my life
Oh darling dance with me
And forget my identity
Oh darling you hurt me
And why did you leave me?
My crying ... is my romance
My romance ... is my soul
Oh darling come back to me
And let's live an eternity
Oh darling why did you fly in the skies
And why you make me cry?
