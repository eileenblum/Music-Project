The sun will become dark
The moon won't shine
The stars will fall from the sky
And the power of the "GOD" will shake
Then the sign will show
The coming of the son of man
Coming of the clouds in the sky
Praise the power with the voices
The earth and the sky will pass
But the words of the son of man
Will never pass but will live forever
Like the lighting that's on the horizon
And you can see it until sun down
That's the way the Second Coming will be!
