Wait, wait, wait ... for the eternity moment
Wait, wait, wait ... for the moment of eternity
Wait, wait, wait ... for the unknown love!

The air that both breathe
Even if we lose our ways
We run away from the world
The clarity of your image is alive!

As your warm closeness
You're cursed to be invisible
I'm cursed to be a part of you
You're my invisible confessor!
And I confess to you
My divine unshared love
I've sinned by not knowing you
I've sinned by not touching you
"In Manus Tua Domine".
I miss you I love you
But I'll hide myself
I'll run away from your hot love
But I'll come back to it and you
You punished me to be happy
 From happiness my death shall come
You condemn me to love loving
 From love to rise
All the holly things you
Killed me!
