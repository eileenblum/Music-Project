[Lacrimosa cover]

Come a little bit closer
And hear what I've got to say
Burning words of anger
Of hate and desperation

What if I break the silence?
What if I do forgive the past?

I know it might sound funny
To tell you what I felt
I mean I really loved you
It's a shame - my fault - I know
But why - but why
Why are you so stupid?
But why - but why
Why are you so stupid?

Fuck you and your killing lies
I hate your pissing attitude
Why did you have to go so low
Trueler - Copycat

What if I break the silence?
What if I do forgive the past?

Sucking like a vampire
The blood of all your friends
But sorry, my blood was poisoned
Now burn in hell

You killed the love
You killed the trust

What if I break the silence
What if I do forgive the past?
