Step back in silence, meet the ecstacy in life
You shouldn't suffer so much
Face the enemy within yourself
Feel this growing anger
Wash in the pain the gates will not be shut
To the world of anger
Feel as much as I feel
More pain than the growing sorrow

Lies supposed to break me
As you always say
It's a war down in the shadows
Your ecstacy lies in hell

Step back in silence, meet the ecstacy in life
You shouldn't suffer so much
Face the enemy within yourself
Feel this growing anger

Lies supposed to break me
As you always say
It's a war down in the shadows
Your ecstacy lies in hell
