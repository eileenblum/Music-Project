Through all the black days
Why can't you hear
That sadness surrounds us?

And so hard I tried
To face the real things in life
I can't see how
I failed to fly
How I failed to fly

Black days they scream
And it hears our lies
It feels so unreal
To face our fears

When I am lost
I run away
So deep in my mind
To cry out in fear
When I am lost
I run away so deep in my mind
To cry out of fear
Faced by reality's screams
So hard, so cruel

Black days they scream
And it hears our lies
It feels so unreal
To face our fears

Through all the black days
Why can't you hear
That sadness surrounds us?
