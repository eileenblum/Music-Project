Open the cap fill up the batteries
Play the game of your life
It's starting to shake
It's ready for you to control
Your flesh starts to sweat
The feeling you need to let go
Just do your thing lose all
the tension and flow

Powertool forever young
forever, forever young
Powertool when we're in bloom
when we're in bloom

Feeling the one handed love
As the best you've ever had
Wiping your mouth and getting
Ready to start again
When your body is shaking
And your sight turns black
You will know that you've found me
The mighty powertool

Powertool forever young
forever, forever young
Powertool when we're in bloom
when we're in bloom
