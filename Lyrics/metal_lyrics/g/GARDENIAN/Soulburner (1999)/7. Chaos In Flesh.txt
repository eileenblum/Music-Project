Open your arms, show me your envy
The fury that makes
Do you cry out when you're in need?
Or do you just act like you're more mean?

So would you hold on now
Let the fate decide?
So would you hold on now
When our sorrow rise?

You are the chaos hidden in dreams
The ones that keep me awake
You are all evil, gathered in
One big monster machine
Force out control
Reign us with fury
Spinning in this endless machine
An eternal session within

You're chaos without limits
You're the sense to control
Evil is inside us all
But you won't get my soul
