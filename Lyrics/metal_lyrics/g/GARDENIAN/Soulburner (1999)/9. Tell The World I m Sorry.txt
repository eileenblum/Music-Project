I want to fuck up everything that you ever loved
I want to lose my head go for the bat and crush your head
Relax for a while think it over
All the vicious circles I'm trembling in are going further down
The last words you ever spoke still echo in my head

The world has turned and left me here
So stiff and cold
Find hope, find a cure, find happiness
For my ragged, tortured soul

Tell the world I'm sorry
For blowing it all away
Tell the world I'm sorry
When I'm out of your way

I can feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
And it's crushing me
Faith is not enough, give me strength so my heart
Can keep pounding on
It's time to step back a minute or two
To think it over
All the vicious circles I'm trembling in
Are going further down
