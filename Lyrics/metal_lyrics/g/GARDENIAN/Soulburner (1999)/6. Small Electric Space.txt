This is our small electric space
A place of love a place of hate
Friends that hold you true
Who scares you more than you
Sometimes it's warm sometimes it's cold
Sometimes it's just like your world
Lost track of time lost the whole of you
Lost every thing worth fighting for

So you hide in your world
If ever time could heal your wounds
So you hide in our world
In our small Electric Space

This is our small electric space
A place for joy a place for your soul
If ever time means much to you
Find this place
Tears of gold tumbling down
Feelings that're cold take you far
Forever keeping life so true
Now you're damned

So you hide in your world
If ever time could heal your wounds
So you hide in our world
In our small Electric Space
