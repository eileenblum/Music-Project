Everything seems to be flowing
My mind is set to consume you
And when the world comes down on you
Don't come to me to shed your tears

We got the time to find
Something to live for
Deserted mind like mine
To flow around in here

We've all got a line
You've crossed yours
You have crossed the breaking point
So don't come to me
And shed your tears

We got the time to find
Something to live for
Deserted mind like mine
To flow around
In here that our lives
To draw the line

It's hard so hard
That life has passed now
All that they know
So what is left now
To live for?
