Can't feel the rush that I used to
It's as you weren't there
I can't straighten my back right
I am so in despair
Now it's dark and I can't see
What the dreams carry to me

If tomorrow is gone
I would feel more comfort
And if
If tomorrow is gone
I'd stop being lonely

Can't feel the rush that I used to
It's as you weren't there
I can't straighten my back right
I am so in despair
Now it's dark and I can't see
What the dreams carry to me

If tomorrow is gone
I would feel more comfort
And if
If tomorrow is gone
I'd stop being lonely
