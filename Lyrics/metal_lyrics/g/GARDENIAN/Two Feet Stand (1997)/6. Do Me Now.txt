Get me done
Clear your arm for another shoot
Inject me!
Feel the tension that chills your bones
your step belongs to me

So don't face me / so don't face me
So don't confront me / Don't confront me
So don't face me / so don't face me
So don't confront me / try to do me now

I am the one who makes your stands
I am the nightmare they tried to hide
So keep me close to your heart
You never thought it could hurt so bad

[repeat chorus]
