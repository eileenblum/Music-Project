Strong is he who fights
for his beliefs
Everyday he struggles
with his grief
Crossbound by all his
friends
Listen he's taking all the
blame

For you and me
Just don't loose
your faith in me

Preaches about hell
on earth
No one cares, but wants
to be like you... to be you

You and I return alive
into a world
that's mine again
Warfare!
Standing on my own
Love her!
Love her on the throne
Left her! Left her all alone
The bleeding, stands
Closer now to put
an end to this
Feel her, touch her
and the pain would go

Griefing your loss of her
Standing on my own

Two feet stand
Two feet stand
