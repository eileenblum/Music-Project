Why did I do such a thing
to myself, my family and friends
I distracted them with lies
I thought they were blind
but yet they saw

What was I doing to me
I was so blind

Ain't got the time
Ain't got the time
to straighten up myself

I fooled everyone
with my tearfilled eyes
but not only with lies
Also with my cries
I figured I was better
but really I don't know
Cause nothing exists!

In my head
those voices screaming
wake me up
I must be dreaming
In my head those voices
screaming
dreaming

No one can ever drag me
back to shoot
I've got my own free choice
Working with learning
other people to know
how to handle it
And accepting all the lies
Fiction reality makes 'em cry

I got my own free choices

Ain't got the time
Ain't got the time
To straighten up myself
Fall down again
Falling again to the
Flipside of reality
