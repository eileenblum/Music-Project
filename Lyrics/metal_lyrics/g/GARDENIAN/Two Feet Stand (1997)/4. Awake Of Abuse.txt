Keep me awake, speak to me
I don't ever want to sleep again
I can see you look at the bruises
on my arms and neck, my swollen throat

Now at the time I'm just flowing
with the stream and I'm trying
to bring back my life

Patience, endless rules
brings me back and forth
my own domestic war

Wake me into another world
where there is no pain and hurt

It all submits
that I shouldn't take
to be abused anymore
Keep on living but still afraid
and would it be too late

[repeat chorus]
