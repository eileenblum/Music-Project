You're destroying everything
Everything you touch
When you are here in me
This is how close you'll get
with me, I'm like the criminal
Insane with an urge of rage in me 
I shouldn't still be free

The voices in my head twist my mind groundly
Paralyzed my fears of my own judgement

Not standing on my own controlled
by a voice in my head
Losing the control of life
can't decide about my own visions of life
So sickened of the lies

The voices in my head twist my mind groundly
Paralyzed my fears of my own judgement
Cause of what they say no matter what
Still I hear their screams, terrified, afraid

Grow

A piece is getting sicker my mind is contaged
Insane, prevailed

It could happen to us all in a day
Falling down into my crypt
The voices in my head will stay free

Voices!

The voices in my head twist my mind groundly
Paralyzed my fears of my own judgement
Cause of what they say no matter what
Still I hear their screams, terrified, afraid
