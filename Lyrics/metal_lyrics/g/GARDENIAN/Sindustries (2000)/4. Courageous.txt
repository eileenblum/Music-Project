Existing for chaos
To harm conceive and lie
Twisting all straight answers I'm a fake
Silently respectfully I move behind your backs
Secretly suspiciously I create my little lies

I seem to have forgotten the truth
As well as story
Nothing no longer adds up
Regretting my conviction to be as every one
Hiding my solutions deep in my pride

I am here for you
I am here for you

No one longer listens
I have a hard time to reach out
Might they have discovered all my wrongs
I guess I never realised the problems
That I've caused
I guess I have myself to blame
For trusting all those lies

I must reach out explain these lies
I just don't have the courage
To do it at this time
I must reach out explain these lies
I just don't have the courage
To do it at this time
