Follow all familiar paths now
Accessing all human minds
Injecting my veins with your hatred
My focus never stays the same
Pure! So fresh I can test it
Taste it in my narrow mind
Focus well and inject it
Blindfold my eyes
When my apathy dies

Sure I will rise up and face it
Another day of sunshine lies
This world is made by my fiction
Injected in my body's pride
How long must I reach out
Eating my own vomiting
Is our hearts meant to be broken
Broken within broken this sin

Ten thousand lies
Can't touch me so
In the way that you do
Ten thousand lies
Disregard less why
Can't touch me so hard
Like you

Sure I will rise up and face it
Another day of sunshine lies
Is our hearts meant to be broken
Broken within broken this sin

I'll promise the world I leave after
That I will take my poison down
I'll bring it back to my pit stop
Pump in my fuel pump engine rule
I feel so left behind
My senses calming way down
The needle enters my skin
The rush is here and no pain becomes me

Sure I will rise up and face it
Another day of sunshine lies
This world is made by my fiction
Injected in my body's pride
