Isolate, imprisonate,
The siege of my own god damned soul
I refuse to see my errors
Confess my sins and dig down in this hole
Spreading my lies consuming their minds
Reflecting myself on other lives
But when I'm dead buried and rotten
They will remember me

There's a long snap to zero
Two of us share our reflection
There's a long snap to zero
Two of us knows our reaction

Another star has died
Open the jar of tension
Let loose the lying beast
Waiting here forever

Wake up feel low
All the time's the same
Fill upp this tension jar
Crushing on your chest
As you were based in
Another time andspace
Holding my world
Deep down below

Who might have known
They all told me
There's a long snap to zero just go on
So yes they know
Of all my lies allright
There's a long snap to zero coming along
