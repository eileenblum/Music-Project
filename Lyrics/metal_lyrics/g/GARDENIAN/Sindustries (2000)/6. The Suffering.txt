Have you met your god yet?
I've sure met mine

Suffer! Intensely my friend
Keep on having those grave remorse
Caught up in the act of stupidity
By sharing your thoughts
You're the worst kind of whore
Suffer! Even harder my friend
Yet my lessons unlearned
Painful small decisions may
Control your life for years at the time

Closer, it might have begun
Forcing yourself to be numb
Closer, why won't it just come
Closer, it might have begun
Forcing yourself to be numb
Closer, why won't it just come

Suffer! As intense as you may
In this blizzard of madness
Mixed in this flurry like womb you'll see
All your dreams become shattered to me
Suffer! A bit more now again
Wake the hope that they'll see you
Suffer! More intensely my friend
Scream out loud they might hear your cries
Jesus! It might have begun
Jesus! It feels like I'm numb
JESUS!
