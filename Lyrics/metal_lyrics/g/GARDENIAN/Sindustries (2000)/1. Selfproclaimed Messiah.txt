I am your god I am your dreams
I am everything you'll always need
These are the words of a humble man
The king of stone, the people's heart

I have never tried to reach this far before
I have never set my goals for sure
Some promises come some of them go

I am your alternative Messiah
Your King of the stone
Your deciples of my stone
I am your, your big Messiah

Hold him, embrace him just have him close
Don't shut him in just become him
Hold him, embrace him just have him close
Don't shut him in just become him

I am your God
