Breath! Let's rush in let's lose control
Breath! Let's rush in let's lose control
Cries! Let's rush in let's lose control
Cries! Let's rush in let's lose control
Flowing away! Flowing away!
Into this endless tide
Ending up in the drain
Watching back at another life

This day won't ever remind them of our
Tear soaked ways of ending each other

Breath! Let's rush in let's lose control
Breath! Let's rush in let's lose control
Cries! Let's rush in let's lose control
Cries! Let's rush in let's lose control
Running away! Running away!
Deep down into this down
Flooding up in the drain
Shedding its tears beyond

It LIVES
It FEEDS
It BREEDS
It GROWS
It SUCKS you dry
When I saw you drown
I saw you drown

When you are soaked in your tears
Your tears they remind me
Just give it away give it away
Give all your problems to me
I'll use them better you'll see
Control my acts and needs
Control my thoughts
So deep down in this pool of tears
