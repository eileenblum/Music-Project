If I give you the world
I'll make it black
If I give you air to breathe
If I give you air to breathe
If I give you sight
I would stab my eyes
If I give you all my trust
I am used and feel so bruised

So we'll make a mess of our lives
I'll paint your world in black
Too cold for you to get out
So I'll stop your grieving heart machine
It won't be any wonder
But you'll be deep down in slumber

If I give you time
I will choke in time
If I hold you at this line
If I hold you at this line
I would never feel so left behind
I could straighten up this hive
And let you feel behind
If I gave you eyes too blind to see
Undoubtedly I win all the thoughts
You stole inside
If I gave you a tough
You could scream it out loud
Instead of sucking it all in
Down into your sin

Deep down inside
Deep down inside

So deep down
