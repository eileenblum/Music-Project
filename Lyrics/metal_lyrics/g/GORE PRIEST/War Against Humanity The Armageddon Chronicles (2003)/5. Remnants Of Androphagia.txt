I hear thy call, throne of the night
Majestic splendour of the nature
Dead by dawn, slaughtered by mankind
They shall die for what they have done

I sense the woods who suffer
Whispering my name
In arcane cries they lay
Behold, androphagi
This is what's left

Endless fields of lifeless nature, northwoods crushed by unsatiable mouths.
These are the remnants of androphagia

You can't feel what they feel
For nature's yell is never heard
Nature's in pain, woodlands are wasted
The daylight will soon reach its end

I sense the woods who suffer
Whispering my name
In arcane cries they lay
Behold, androphagi
This is what's left

Horizons of wastelands storming amidst otherworldly forces,
Millions of arcane lifesources stabbed to death as golden blasphemous scissors to the hair.
These are the remnants of androphagia

The daylight will soon reach its end
