In mourning silence, I took a look inside the rotten coffin...
Each of my tears had 16 tons of weight, and my face has never been so long.
Then in the moment, my barely opened eyes saw the face of a hero,
Dead by flesh but not by spirit.
I sat down in a corner, drown in the candle's flame, remembering the traumatic experience.
It was horrible, and the only words that came to my mind were frustration, defeat, emptiness, loneliness, fear and melancholy...
Father, I hear thy call...
