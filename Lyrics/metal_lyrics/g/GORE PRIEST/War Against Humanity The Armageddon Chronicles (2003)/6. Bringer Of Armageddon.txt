When the daylight reaches its end
And the darkness covers the lands
A fog of chaos descends
The armageddon is here

Human beings, now it's too late
On your knees, behold your fate
All your creations, destroyed
All of your sins will be paid

Fearful, you will pray
To the one made of souls
Ignoring that this day
Was prepared by Him, for you

I feel the guilt inside my soul
As a human, as a sinner, I recognize it is my fault
You foolish human, now it's too late
Behold destroyed creations, this is your fate

But the daylight had to reach its end,
Did the chaos have to descend
So you could repent for your fucking sins??

After your creations are destroyed
After all your sins are paid,
Is that the moment you needed
To finally reach the catharsis??

THERE WILL BE NO MERCY!!

THE ARMAGEDDON IS FINALLY HERE!!
NOW TELL ME WHERE THE FUCK IS YOUR GOD??
