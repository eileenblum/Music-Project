Rise, alter ego
Priest of the fallen world
Shelter of wandering souls
King of the eternal night

"I am the fallen one
I am your only god
I am the new messiah
Evil, and born in fire"

Slaughter fills them with fear
Suffer. Tears aeterna
Reign of terror, where darkness prevails
I, the grimlord, will punish this kingdom of hate!

All you fucking humans will burn
In the unholy flames beneath
Where the colors fade to gray
And death is the only destiny you will ever find

A realm of pure hatred
Has risen to the earth
Where life seems to be pathless
And death is the only end

A realm of pure hatred
Has risen to the earth
Where I am the hunter
And mankind is my prey

Slaughter fills them with fear
Suffer. Tears aeterna
Reign of terror, where darkness prevails
I, the grimlord, will punish this kingdom of hate!
