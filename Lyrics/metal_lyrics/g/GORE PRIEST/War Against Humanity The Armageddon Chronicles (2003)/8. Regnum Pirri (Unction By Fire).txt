All life lies beneath
This kingdom of flames
A furnace of fire
This is hell on earth

Although there's no satan
The flames are enough
To punish all mankind
For what they have done

Feel the delightful pain of an ashen landscape
Infinite heat, burning flames, everything turned to dust
An unveiled inferno has risen to perform His tormention
For imminent genocide is now your only redemption

Mankind shall suffer
Corpses are burning
A global unction by fire
And only the blessed shall be risen
To the spherelands of God

All life lies beneath
This kingdom of flames
A furnace of fire
This is hell on earth

Although there's no satan
The flames are enough
To punish all mankind
For what they have done

An unveiled inferno has risen to perform His tormention
From now on, an unction by fire will be thy redemption
