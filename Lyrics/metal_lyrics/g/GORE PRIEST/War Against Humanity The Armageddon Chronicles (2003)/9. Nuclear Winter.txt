Silence
Void
Loneliness
Melancholy

Roaming earth
Ice inferno
Lux absentia
Amorteus nocturne

Behold your frozen seas
Behold mountains of snow
Freezing holocaustwinds
Are hiding the sun

The mountains inmense
Of frozen corpses
A new ice age
Has arrived

Cold desolation
Everything has died
The corpses lay frozen
In mountains inmense
