Kingdom of the night
Risen beyond these walls
With absence of sun
Only to be enlightened by moonlight

A place that lives and dies
Exists without existence
Empires without emperor

A place that lives and dies
Only to be enlightened by moonlight
Exists without existence
Only to be darkened in plenilunium

Fullmoon insanity
As lycanthropic souls are watching
Covered by the mist
Envisioned from worlds beyond

Astral plains of life, shades of night
Bliss of light, in eternal plenilunium

Cursed land, thy majesty prevails
Echoing among emptiness
For eyes the path of madness
For eyes mystic empire
For eyes the mist of night
For eyes the unholy might
For eyes the plenilunium empire

Tainted souls, darkened lives, this is all you need

A place that lives and dies
Exists without existence
Where past is future
And future is present
