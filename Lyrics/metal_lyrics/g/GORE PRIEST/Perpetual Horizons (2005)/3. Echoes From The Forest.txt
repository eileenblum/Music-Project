Shines of night, splendour majestic
Shades of green in pillars of brown
Onwards to the gathering of blissful silence
In the middle of a whisper

A shelter, for the ones that live in sorrow
Mystic hideout, dimension of darkness
Thou that once served me as my homeplace
Once again call, and wait for my reversion

Unholy night, melas khole in extremis
The silent tranquility of the calm seas of leaves
Speechless I walk, onwards to the woods of eternity
Between arcane whispers, breaking what is already broken

Once inside, the gate invisible
Shall close the exit from this darkened realm
Vision fades, my eyes are closed
In the middle of a tear

The silent leaves suddenly are higher
Your brown arms begin to develop
Your head grows until it fades to green
And then you will whisper, waiting for the next fool to come

Drowned in the forest amidst desperate and silent whispers, echoes from the forest...
