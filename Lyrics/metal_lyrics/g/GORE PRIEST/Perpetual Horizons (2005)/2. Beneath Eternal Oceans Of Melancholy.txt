A darkened place of inner thoughts
A shelterdome that lies beneath
Darkness prevails in these landscapes
My inner realm of vanishment

The choirs of the night summon me from within
To my eternal ocean of melancholy
And then, the path I follow, dragged me into the deep
A way of self-protection that leads me into self-destruction

Vanished from the world, in eternal torment
I shall descend into the eternal oceans
In excelsis alter ego, take me into infinite depression
Save me from this world of endless blasphemy

The moonlight majestic reflected in waters
The heat that feels freezing, shall aid me in my need
And slowly I walk, onwards to the drowning
Unsilent, I'm dying, in waters I'm lying
Vanished from the world, in eternal torment
I shall descend into the eternal oceans
In excelsis alter ego, take me into infinite depression

Hail, forsaken realm, rise from the darkness
Now, show me the path, and let me escape
Oh, majestic eternal, in thee I shall drown
Night, thy infinite presence shall lead my redemption
The choirs of the night summon me from within
To my eternal ocean of melancholy
And then, the path I follow, dragged me into the deep
A way of self-protection that leads me into self-destruction
