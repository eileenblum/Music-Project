Beneath a veil with texture of lies
Behold its face, soulskinned with eyes Of wrath and relentless fury
We breath all the falsehood that you gave birth to

Disguised with punishment
Hiding obscure blessings
Disguised, with life
Envenomed, with death

Aesthetic beauty, perfect ugliness
Sculptured existence, neverborn mortality
Airwalk, neumatic equilibrium uncertain
Inversions, vortex, energy, supremacy
Extremity, obscurity, raw death, solitude
Bats in the place of peace
Death in the place of war
The obscenity has been unveiled

Made from nocturnal enlightenment
Unleashed in veiled encagement
Jailed through left hand path
And released to the way of madness

My birth shall be thy disgrace
My arrival be thy repentance
My hands shall lead thy doom
And my life shall be thy perishment

Breed of hatred, melancholy
Towards whose I spend an eternity
Born beyond the walls of this dream

I began this walk through trespassing the walls of sleep, gathered beyond this withered realm towards submissions of sublime death, the undeniable consequence of this spawning blessed, so pure, and yet so blackened.

Breed of hatred, melancholy
Towards whose I spend an eternity
Born beyond the walls of this dream
Immune creation obscene
