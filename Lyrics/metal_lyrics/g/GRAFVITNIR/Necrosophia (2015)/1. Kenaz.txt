In my lucid dreams my somber spirit soars
And leaves this world fiercely burned and scarred
In cold lifeles embers, fragments of a dying world
Led by mournful whispers and a dark light from afar

Far away from the sun's warm rays

Leaving the mortal world far behind
Treading the path of obscurity
The path of rapture and dark knowledge so vast
Far beyond human comprehension
Far beyond the edge of sanity

Crossing frozen wastelands of death
In quest for the source, the throne of blackened light
An entrance to the otherworld realm
Of hidden secrets and wisdom of the night

Greeted by the eerie winds of damnation
And their increasing freezing cold breath
strenghtened by the shadows of the darkside eclipse
And the liberating powers of death

Constantly drawn by the call from the shadow realm
Sinister is the path to the black light

Entering the temple of arcane mystery
Of secrets since time immemorial concealed
Thrilled to see the unseeable
the splendours of the shadow realm
The abyss of horrid ecstacies

A forthcoming meeting with the majesty of death
The unquestionable ruler of the night
I shall face the beauty of death's incarnate
Enlightened by the blackest of lights

Far away from the sun's warm rays

Prime dark illumination - A fearsome liberation of a frozen soul
