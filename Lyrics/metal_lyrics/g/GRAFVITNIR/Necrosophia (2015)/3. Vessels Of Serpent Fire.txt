Sorcery...
performed in the nightly gloom
Witchery...
Under the blackened moon

Summoning the forces of the void
Black hole of nonexistence
Forces of primordial chaos
Matters of dark persistence

Boundless, ageless
Powers of the nightside eclipse
Invoking the most ancient of serpents
From the abyss

Rituals to make the shadows whirl
And the snake uncurl
Summoning the ancient serpent
from the depths of the underworld

Fatal desires to bring forth
the day of reckoning
Red eyes burning in the black
Whispers so beckoning
From the other side

Open the devil's eye!

Come forth
Apostles of the raging chaos
Bringers of death and pain
Vessels of serpent fire
(Thrust your) daggers
through the hearts of the profane
