Into the death mist
Sworn to the force of darkness
A force that whirls around me
As I enter the eternal night

Into the vast forever
Beyond both time and space
Freed from this mortal prison
These shackles of flesh and blood

Into the vast forever
To this mortal coil finally unbound
Into the realms of shadows
Fulfillment of my darkest desires

Ordained to crush the creation
Destined to murder the world
Strengthened by the icy cold shadows
Enriched by the wisdom of the grave

An interdimensional journey
To where all the stars are burned black
Drawn by tremendous dark powers
Into the unseen, the dark realms of infinity

Into the void of ultimate blackness
I am crossing forbidden wide gaps
Mysterious forces to be unleashed
As I approach the ancient kingdom of death

Into the vast well of darkness
