Into realms where time stands still
Beyond your darkest dreams
Unto paths unimagined
Where the winds of obscurity screams

Ascending flame of the underworld
Ignite my inner spark
Tearing the nine worlds asunder
Tearing the profane man apart

Through aeons of perpetual night
Through the acosmic haze
We wish to see this world succumb
to the fires of your rage

Awake O ancient dragon
Set this world ablaze
Awake O ancient serpent
Unfold a brand new age
