Thunderous rumbling of things unknown
A glowing light shines through the mist
Into the sphere of the acausal I am thrown
In the grip of invicible fists

So repulsive so attractive
The fire of Golachab burns within my soul
As I stare into the abyss with horrid glee
I can hear the bells of apocalypse toll

The greater picture reveals itself to me
In death's icecold embrace
Sickening splendours becomes clear to see
As the black sun breaks through the haze

Its flaming rays cuts life knives
Through the illusion of deception and dismay
I cleanse myself in its radiance
As it burns all the dogmas away
