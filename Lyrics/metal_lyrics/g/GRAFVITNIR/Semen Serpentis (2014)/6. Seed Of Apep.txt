Black flame - rage untamed
In anticipation of a forthcoming age
A legacy from the dwellers outside the universe
An internal burning brand
The flame of sacrificial pyres
of a million bonfires
that has lighten up the path for the few
Sprung from the seed of Apep
since the dawn of time
It proclaims a rising tide

Death will follow death
In the screaming storm to come
A storm of demonforged steel

Unfold your wings, dragon serpent of Omega
Your scaly wings as black as the flame you provide
Steam rising from your nostrils
Your tail lashed in fury
Your prey, mankind's fate and the entire creation

Dragon serpent lustrous black
Wings so vast
Whole worlds are swallowed up in their shadow

Black glistening scales of mysteries so obscure
Slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet
Eyes shimmering with the darkest wisdom
Dark provider of the transcendental sacred black flame

The torch of enlightenment
The flame of perception
In a world on the brink of extinction

Guide to the kingdom of profound mystery!

Turn the key and open the gateway

From the darkest depths
Open the gate to the dark beyond

Fill us all with spiritual awe!
