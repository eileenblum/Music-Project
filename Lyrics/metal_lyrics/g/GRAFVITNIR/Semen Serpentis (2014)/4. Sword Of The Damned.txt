Wordless whispers from within
urging me onward on the darkest of trails
The light is growing dim
and the winds of enchantment wails

Energies whirl around me
as I am approaching my fate
To slice the throats of the mundane
and to unfold raging fires of hate

Apocalyptic visions appear before my eyes
as I stare into the abyss
Surronded by stormwinds from beyond  the poles,
I am granted K'tonians bliss

Howling nightwinds bring to me
the beckoning whispers of the dark
Urging me onward on the path of might
lighting up my internal spark

The deepest of spiritual mysteries,
unseen hands are guiding my feet
From this wordly plain I will soon be released,
my mission here is complete

I have wielded the sword of the damned,
of spirits of hatred and scorn
Between the gates of hidden wisdom
lies the burning darkness to which I am sworn
