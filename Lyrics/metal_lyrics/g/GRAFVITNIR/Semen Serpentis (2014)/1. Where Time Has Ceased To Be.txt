I have glimpsed the future in flames
A future so dark and grim
As the forces of creation will perish
Creation's light in growing dim

Mankind's fate is written in stars
Stars that will wither and die
A breath of darkness falls heavy on the world
Make us all at one with the night

We welcome the ageless reign of darkness
Rotting roots at the tree of life
The skies of the end will be as black as night
The sun will be turned into darkness,
and the moon into blood

Where time has ceased to be

Unfold the age of fire
Let Cosmos burn in the raging flames of hate

Forgotten pathways
Doors to eternity opens wide
Foundations of the mundane sphere
has shattered and died

On freezing winds of death and damnation
we will ride side by side
Into realms of eternal night
Where reality and time has ceased to be
Where the dark lord who sees mankind as prey
is unleashed

Where time has ceased to be

The violent rapture of the blissful end
