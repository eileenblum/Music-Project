Tremble...
As this world tears asunder by ghoulish winds of ice
Lucifer's dagger shall slit the throats of the profane and pierce their eyes
Violently tearing away pieces of flesh, sever into shreds a world of lies
Spawn from hell's fire, militias of menace shall arise
...As this world dies

A brotherhood of black fire, sprung from the serpent's seed
Legions of the left light shall make the profane bleed
Awake the fires of hell, unleash all it's furious morbidity
Beyond the spheres of "god" the black sun streams revealingy

Descendants of the serpent - The offspring of NaHash
Heed the call of the blood of Qayin and tear the clayman's flesh!
Apostles of black purity - Sons of the serpent's blood
Bloodline of the black light - Hack to death the son of "god"!

O Qayin - Your mark burns upon our brows
We bear your mark with pride
We are sprung from your cunning seed
Your flame we bear inside

Your flaming blood flows inside our veins
The wisdom of the snake
Spawn from hell's fire
The cosmic barriers we will break

O Qayin - Bringer of acosmic light
The wisdom of the grave
Master of the primal fire
And primordial ocean waves

Ignite the blood within us
Liberate us from the flesh
Baptize us in wisdom
Your dark breed of NaHash
