An embrace of the night, as cold as ice
Entranced by the cold of the unlight
can not resist the call of the SerpentÂ´s blood
A fathomless urge to explore the dark
What lies beyond the veil? 

Beyond the cold embrace of death...
An eternity and beyond!

Bursting through the shimmering clouds
Into the radiant twilight
Soaring through dimensions
Streaking through the void
Into the realm of perpetual dark

On scaly wings I fly into the night
On winds of death to the other side 
My inner self comes into sight
Illuminated by the black sun
My journey has reached itÂ´s end

...yet only just begun

With the scepter of Setekh
I rip open the veil of Creation
My spiritual journey
My final step
Outside the frame

As dreadful as eternityÂ´s cold void
I spread my wings in ghastliness
Undying light in an eternity of darkness
The secrets of death unveiled to me

Read in gouts of blood
