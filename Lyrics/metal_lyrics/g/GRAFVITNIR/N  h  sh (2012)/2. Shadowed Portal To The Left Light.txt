In the dusk as light slowly fades away
And darkness embraces my whole being
Shadows dancing their grim bodeful dance
As this night will last eternally

Eternally

A lifetime of melancholy and hatred
Fettered in shackles of flesh and blood
In this dark forest, so eerie
I shall finally be able to pass through
to the other side

Pull me over the edge
Through the gate of infinity
Let me enter the dark
The shadowed portal

To the left light

Grant me the wisdom of the grave
Grant me all the visions of the nightside
Winds of death now blows so cold
Greets me - A servant of the dark

As my blood is dripping cold

Bursting through dimensions
Through the gate of infinity
An entrance to the dark beyond
Through the shadowed portal

To the left light
