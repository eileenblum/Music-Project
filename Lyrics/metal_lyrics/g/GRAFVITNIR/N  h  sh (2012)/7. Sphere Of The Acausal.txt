Like a storm of disastrous proportions
Like a raging tide
Like the raging waters of a Scorpio Moon
the gates to the outer sphere
about to be opened wide

Enlightened by the dreaded flame of Moloch
Blessed with the mark of the beast

Forever within the grasp
of the whirlpool of the dark
Baptized in Chaos' raging seas

The tempest of Tiamat
about to be unleashed!

Stormwinds of nothingness
about to be unleashed!

Burning devotion to the bringers of nightfall
Missionaires of the nocturnal curse

Positioning ourselves as redeemers
As the earthly foundations are about to burst

Architects of murder
and the death of the universe

Enter the sphere of the acausal
Unlock the forbidden gates
Leave behind the symbolic order
Worlds of dark wonders awaits

An entrance to hidden dimensions
Veiled gateways are everywhere
Woven into the deeper currents of the unseen
Portals to the outer sphere

Ominious tales whispered by nightwinds
Dark sorceries brought to life anew
Granting us knowledge of the unknowable
The dark secrets the ancient ones knew
The wisdom of the night
Held by Naglfar's crew

The abode of utter blackness awaits us
The crawling chaos are calling our names
Mystical communion with creatures far older than "god"
Their images burned into our brains
Their signatures scrawled in the cracks between worlds
Timeless kingdoms of dark mystery

Labyrinths of dark wonders
Breathing tunnels of infernality
A journey far into the unknown
the abode of the dark trinity

Samael
Lilith
Qayin

Chaos
