Ancient entity
Make me at one with the night and at one with thee
My soul thrives on grief
A soul wrapped in darkness and melancholy

Flaming intensity
Red hot burning sensation of divinity
A ravishing hunger to be free
To wander the shadow realms

For eternity

Realms of primordial chaos
Kingdoms of shells
where dark energy flows with unbroken continuity

At one with the current of dark ecstasy
At one with the serpent fire everlastingly

So let me die by thy scythe
Dark lord of the unknown
Let me bleed and tread the path of night

Free my soul
as cold as the freezing nightsky
Let it levitate to thy kingdom
The source of blackened light

Come cast thy shadow over me
Show me infernal sights

On dragon wings, on death's cold breeze
On blackened streams, I'll ride along with thee

Ceaselessly

Enlighten me
with thy black light of clarity
Open up my eyes, wide to see
Through the mist of obscurity

Release me from the fetters of mortality
Open up my eyes, wide to see
Beyond the gate of infinity

Forge me in to a soldier of ice cold steel
With the strength to break the eleventh seal
On the wings of darkness, on death's cold breeze
Transformed into a dark knight of the shadowbreed

My mortal life, merely a vague memory
Ancient mysteries of death now revealed to me
