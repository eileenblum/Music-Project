In the fog of the sea
In a gloomy castle
Galloping through the fields of Spain
The undead knights of a medieval order
Are back from the grave

Bloodthirsty warriors from beyond
Waiting patient in the gloom
Noone can stop the knights of darkness
They are coming for you!!!

With their sharp swords
And their awesome helmets
Breeding their blind terror
Decrepit skeletons with frame and shields
The are the face of horror

Torture and kill confused tourists
In the darkness of the night
Cadavers sliced in the morning
The most horrendous sight
