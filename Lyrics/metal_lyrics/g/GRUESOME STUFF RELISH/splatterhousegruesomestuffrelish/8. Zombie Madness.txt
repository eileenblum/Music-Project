Spreading the sickness
Zombie madness
Smell of the raw flesh
Zombie Madness

Their stench tell me they are near
Their growls I can hear
Our flesh, their morbid desire
But we're gonna aim and fire!

Innocent people devoured
In this apocalyptic war
Cadavers in the streets
That smell makes me sick!

Dead bodies coming back to life
Ravenous appetite, Zombie Madness!
The rotten corpses refuse to die
We're gonna fall into darkness

Zombie Madness!!!
