Hungry and terrified I'm the last survivor 
All my friends died in the dense jungle
Similar fate await me too
I can't escape they will capture me soon

Now I'm trapped and wounded in a hideous pit
In a primitive cave with the oppressive heat
Waiting for the death waiting in my jail
Covered in mud and skeletal remains

Violence
Lust for flesh
Stranded in Mindanao
