Streets are full of hungry zombies.
Please donât go out tonight.
You have been warned.

City of the dead - The walking dead.
City of the dead - They follow your scent.

Walking through an alleyway. Youâll feel their breath.
Donât try to run. Thereâs no escape.

City of the dead - The walking dead.
City of the dead - They follow your scent.

Zombie eyes. Watching you.
Donât go out tonight or theyâll eat you.
