Maggots in your skin.
Devouring your flesh.
You feel nothing but youâre still conscious.
Became a zombie!!!

You canât control your hunger.
The lust for human flesh.
You canât control your movements.
Your teeth begin to grind.
Became a zombie!!!
Youâre not a human being.
Your body is cold and rotten.
You canât stop eating.
Killing and feeding on the living.
Become a zombie!!!
