Brought to life via radiation sickness
Voodoo, witchcraft or ancient rites
You can see the zombies get up and kill
The are everywhere and no one knows why

Lack of all intellect and all personality
Worm-riddle corpses looking for food
A rambling pack of hungry zombies
Bringing the fear to your neighborhood

Panic striken with terror and grief
The dead walk the Earth and feed on the living
Frightened survivors losing his minds
The dead walk the ruins of the dead city

The dead will walk the Earth

When there is no more room in hell
The dead will rise from their graves
When there is no more room in hell
The dead will walk the Earth
