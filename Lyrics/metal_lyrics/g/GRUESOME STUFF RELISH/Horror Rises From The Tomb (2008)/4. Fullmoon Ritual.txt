Hunting humans in the fullmoon ritual
The tribe is craving for flesh
The sorcerer drink the coagulated blood
The children play with the heads

Expeditions had plunged into
These dark jungles never to return
The tribe of cannibals
Around the altar of sacrifices

Fullmoon ritual
In the jungle
