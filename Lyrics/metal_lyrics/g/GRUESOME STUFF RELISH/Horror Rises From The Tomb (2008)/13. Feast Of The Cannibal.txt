Trapped in a jail
Tortured again
Fear and pain
There's no escape

Wounded and sore
Drowned in gore
Dismembered alive
Left to die

Arms and legs
Blood and flesh
Cruel sacrifices
Food for the tribe

Raw meat
Roasted in the fire
The captives are food
Only food

Feast of the cannibals
Feast of flesh

Hot blood... They drink
Hot blood... and raw meat
