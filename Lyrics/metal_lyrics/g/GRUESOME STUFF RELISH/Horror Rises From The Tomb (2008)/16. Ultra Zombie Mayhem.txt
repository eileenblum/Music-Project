Ten grams of cocaine
Two hundred beers
A savage plan

We've got the drugs
We've got the music
The guns are loaded

Ultra zombie mayhem
Start shooting at their heads
We're the worst nightmare
of the living dead

Last men alive
In a new mission
To save the world

Drugs and beers
Give us power
To destroy them all
