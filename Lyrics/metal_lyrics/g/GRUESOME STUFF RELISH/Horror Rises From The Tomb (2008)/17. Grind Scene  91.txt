A new sensation in the underground scene
Raw noise that makes your ears bleed
Good old times good old bands
The golden years for the true grind fans

What a great time
Back to 91
Grindscene 91

GOne are the days of the seven inches
Gone are the days of the demo tapes
Disgrace, Xysma, or The Zombified Preachers 
Carcass and Impetigo were my best teachers
