Trying to find the ritual cannibalism
Trying to find the savages
Attacked by snakes consumed by the fever
The bodies fall into lust

The tribe
The tribe
Worship the symbol of the Tupinamba

Bloodshed violence and terror in the jungle
Fighting to survive
Quicksands insects and hungry cannibals
The reporters are going to die
