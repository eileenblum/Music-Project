Stench of death spread in the air
Tattered corpses lying in the street
Confusion and chaos throughout the city
Horrid orgy of insanity

No one knows why they came back to  life
No one knows why they don't want to die
Lust for blood desire for flesh
In this world of zombie brutality reigns

Hordes of death
Devouring the world
Creatures of hell
Wisdom of the gods
