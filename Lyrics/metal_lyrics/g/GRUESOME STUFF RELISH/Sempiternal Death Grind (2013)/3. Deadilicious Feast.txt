Tonight thereâs a funny smell in the dining room
Our guests give off a strange perfume
Zombified gourmets hungry for flesh
The table is laid and the food is ready to be served

Delicacy made of human lung
Eyes sauce and crispy tongue
Coated in butter and wine yeast
Deadlicious feast

No one can resist the specialty of the house
First quality food for discerning palates
Deadlicious feast fit for our friends
Undead gourmets from beyond the grave
