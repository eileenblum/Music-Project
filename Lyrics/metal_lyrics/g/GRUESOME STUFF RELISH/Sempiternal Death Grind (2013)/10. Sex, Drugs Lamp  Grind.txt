Another hangover, another day
Our heads explode but weâre on our way
We buy some drinks and start to rock
Another city, another show

Sex, drugs and grind
Donât waste your time
Itâs our life

Lubricantâs âNookleptiaâ on the van
A shot, a beer, a shot. Weâre having fun
Thereâs a bunch of hungry bitches waiting for us
After the show weâll be ready to fuck

Trendy wankers thinking theyâre so cool
Better kiss our assess âcos weâre true old school
Playing Grind/Death itâs our life
And weâre going to do it til the day we die
