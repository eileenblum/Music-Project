Caught in a B-movie vortex
Thereâs a zombie on my TV screen
A cold glass of beer in my hands
Is it real or a dream?
My mind doesnât work properly
Hallucinations in my brain
My bodyâs starting to rot
But I donât feel any pain

Thereâs a monster in my basement
Just crazy for human flesh
Heâs polite and a little bit shy
Heâs almost human almost dead
I know thereâs another guest at home
But I couldnât find him yet
He was wallep alive
Because he tried to open the Gates of Hell

A date with Fulci
Every day
Horror prevails
The moon is bright
I have a date tonight

Cadavers and monsters rule my universe
Echoes of terror pain that feels good
Storms of horror B-movie devourer
Condemned to live in my world of darkness

My roommate is a sex offender
He loves bitches, whores and strippers
My roommate quacks like a duck on the phone
My roommate is The New York Ripper
Our friends are a bunch or hungry zombies
They will eat you without no pity
We live in the House by the cemetery
We live in Dunwich city
