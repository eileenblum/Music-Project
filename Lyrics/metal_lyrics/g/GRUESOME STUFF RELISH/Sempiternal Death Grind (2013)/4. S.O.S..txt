Strange world of viscera and diseases
Infected dimension of decay and rot
Pustular cysts and tumorous organs
Drowned in a sea of bubbling pus

S.O.S.

The morbid sound corrodes my ears
I exhume the vinyl to consume it again
I donât know how to explain Iâm sickly obsessed
Slash dementia destroyed my brain

I dissected this recording for 20 years
With surgical precission and forensic patience
Song by song consumed in gore
Now my cerebrum is pulped with cranial collapse

A bloody mess
Rancid stench
Rotting flesh

Crepitating bowel erosion,
Ruptured in purulence
Embryonic necropsy and devourment,
Swarming vulgar mass
Cadaveric incubator, Slash dementia,
Reek of putrefaction,
Empathological necroticism,
Abdominal emanation, Exhume to consume
