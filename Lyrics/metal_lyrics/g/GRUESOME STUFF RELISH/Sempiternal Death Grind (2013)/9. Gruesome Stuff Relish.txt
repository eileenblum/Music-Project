My weekly horrorscope told me that today is my day
Five in the evening, Iâm still sober but now itâs time to play
Some old Death Metal demons and Italian horror films
Come in and sit beside me and grab a beer out the fridge

Addicted to horror arts
Power to our hearts

Always buried in our world
Diving the depths of the underground
Weâre drunken B-Movie ghouls
Feeding on this rotting sound
We want more beer, speed and pills
Old school Grind and Zombie films

Films and misick fill our brains
Weâve got the groove in our veins

Weâre the kings of grindâ¦, GSR
Weâre still alive
Fuck the new school
Grindgore rules!!!
