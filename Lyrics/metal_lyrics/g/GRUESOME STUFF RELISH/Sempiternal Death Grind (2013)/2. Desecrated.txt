They raped the rotten soil
Where I was buried
They took my putrid body
They put it in their laboratory

Desecrated â Reanimated

A cold fluid fills my veins
And make my body burns
I canât control myself
My mind has been zombified

Chained to my masterâs will
Condemned to live forever
Evil enchantment keeps me alive
Alive without no life
