Living the ultimate days
A sea of opened graves
The dead came back to life
Now itâs time to die

The end is near

The night without dawn
The day of doom has come
The stench surrounds the atmosphere
Our end is not too far from here

People turn into living dead
This is not a nightmare inside your head
This is real, this is malevolent
The dead are alive, this is our end
