Maggots in your skin
Devouring your flesh
You feel nothing
But youâre still conscious

Became a zombie

You canât control your hunger
The lust for human flesh
You canât control your movements
Your teeth begin to grind

Youâre not a human being
Your body is cold and rotten
But you can stop eating
Killing and feeding on the living
