They are the plague
Servants of death
They are the plague
They are the death

Spectral breed
Devourers of souls
Messiahs of death
Hideous ghouls
Ravenous cancer
Consuming the world
Cursed beings
Apocalyptic war

Blood moon
In a blackened sky
Countdown to life
End of mankind
Ravenous cancer
Consuming the world
Cursed beings
Apocalyptic war

All paths lead to chaos
Evilness reigns supreme
The dawn of decay has come
We lost our hope because

Cities are museums of the death
Horrid palaces of grief
Visions of a fallen empire
Destruction beyond all belief
