I can remember the first time I saw "The devil and the dead"
"Cannibal Ferox", "The gates of hell", "Graveyard disturbance", "Eaten 
alive"
I found my way, I saw the light
Umbero Lenzy, Michele Soavi, Lamberto Bava, Antonio Climati, Dario Argento, 
Joe D'amato, Lucio Fulci, Ruggero Deodato
Cannibals and zombies
The jungle and the gore
Gods of the splatter
Mondos and softcores
"Zombie flesh eaters" saved my life
"Inferno", "Gomia", giallo all the time
"Cut and run", "Dr. Butcher M.D.", "Demons", "Deep red" and "Zombie 3"
Frank Martin, Vincent Dawn
The kings of zombies will put you down!
Mario Bava, the old school
Spaghetti terror is pretty cool!!!
