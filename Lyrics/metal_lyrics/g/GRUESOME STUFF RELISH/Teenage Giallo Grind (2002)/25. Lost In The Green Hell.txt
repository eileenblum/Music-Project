Drinking on the airplane
Looking through the windows
Somewhere in Malaysia
But the pilot lost control
Panic in the night
Airplane catastrophe
Only a few survivors
The jungle will be our tomb
Crushed faces and human entrails
Death is in the air
Limbripped bodies cut wide opened
Lost in the green hell
