Apocaliptic day of mourning
I can smell the death in the air
I see the people dying
I see the people crawling
I can't believe what's happening in this living hell
It's the aftermath of devastation
Contaminated bodies looking for food
Countdown to the human annihilation
I smell the stench, I feel the rising gloom
Blood ceremony
Antropophagous souls
Apocaliptic scenes
In the city of ghouls
Feel the cannibal virus
See the zombified crowd
See the walking corpses
Hear the doomsday sound
