Through your eyes,
a flaw in the human condition.
You see an act of kindness as my submission.
So unwilling to embrace your mistakes.
Trapped with the fear you had no choice but to create.

[Chorus]
Benevolent submission,
Guilty by your own admission.
(guilty)

Through my eyes,
I'm willing to feel your pain.
And once again,
you expect me to open a vein.
I'll bleed and I'll bleed
for the ones in need.
In hoped that my sacrifice
will set them free.
Expecting nothing in return.
Despite my guilt and regret,
I still haven't learned.
So many come and go that I care for no longer.
In hatred I reign,
only growing stronger.

[Chorus]
Benevolent submission,
Guilty by your own admission.
(guilty)
