One finger on the pulse the other on the trigger.
Democracy built on smoke and mirrors.
Selling your souls to serve the country proud,
fighting for freedom under religious shroud.
Spilling blood on foreign soil,
Waging war for God and oil.
Religious feuds fuel the fire,
Killing for profit to quench your desire.

Mass murder. Systematic propaganda.

In the minds of the masses tearing us apart,
controlling our thoughts before they start.
Feeding into hatred for your fellow man,
integrity judged before they take the stand.
Playing into their web of lies,
Casting stones as morality dies.
Corrupted justice, decaying mankind,
Truth is easy to hide when your people are blind.

Mass murder. Systematic propaganda. Simulated hysteria.
