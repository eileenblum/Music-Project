Feeding off of tragedy... Profit off of pain.
Stand behind your martyrs... Ready to take their aim.

Serving "the greater good".
Spreading your disease.
Selling passage to the holy land.
To those who beg and plea.

(Father Inferior) Judgement shall reign down on you.
(Father Inferior) Hypocrite, vomiting the word of the untrue.

Corruption of the minds... Too blind to see.
Paying for devotion... Collecting innocence as your fee.

Where will you be when the levee breaks?
Drowning in your prophet's lies and mistakes.

(Father Inferior) Judgement shall reign down on you.
(Father Inferior) Hypocrite, vomiting the word of the untrue.

Narcissistic divinity, perverted tranquility.
Unsuspecting sacrifice...
No signs, no mercy.

Crushed by the hand of God. Now you rot in your grave.

(Father Inferior) Judgement shall reign down on you.
