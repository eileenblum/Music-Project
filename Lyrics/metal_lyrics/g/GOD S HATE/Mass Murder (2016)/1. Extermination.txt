I can see it in your eyes, I know what you fear.
Unleashing the truth upon your ears.
Afraid of what you'll learn.
For an eternity your soul will burn.
Scared to question your failing faith.
Refuse to progress spewing words of hate.
Crushed under lies is your fucking fate.
For those who seek a different way, we must exterminate.

[Chorus]
Exterminate: words of the Father.
Blood of youth: spilled across an alter,
Flock is led to unknowing slaughter.
Pissing in the source of the holy water.
Exterminate: lies of the Father.
Blood of youth: spilled across an alter,
Flock is led to unknowing slaughter.
Pissing in the source of the holy water.

I will crush your spirit, devour your soul.
Taking from you what makes you whole.
A lamb of God out of pasture.
Supreme defiance to your holy master.

[Chorus]
Exterminate: words of the Father.
Blood of youth: spilled across an alter,
Flock is led to unknowing slaughter.
Pissing in the source of the holy water.
Exterminate: lies of the Father.
Blood of youth: spilled across an alter,
Flock is led to unknowing slaughter.
Violate the source of the holy water.

With rotting beliefs, you'll fall to your knees.
Accepting the truth of your unheard pleas.
Hypocrisy breeds with inferior genes.
Your organized disease will bleed at the seams.
Extermination... A threat of damnation.
Your demise in sight, I celebrate in jubilation.
When push comes to shove, your kingdom will fall.
Millennia of lies, holy curtain call.
