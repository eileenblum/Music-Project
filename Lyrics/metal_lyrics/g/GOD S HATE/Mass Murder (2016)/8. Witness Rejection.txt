You're a hypocrite, you're full of shit.
Your peers are fucking sick of it.
Went too far, crossed the line.
Serve your time.
Luck's run out, you found out,
what your lie is all about.
Now we see our enemy.
There is only...

[Chorus]
One solution: revolution
[Break your silence, start the violence.]
You've been wronged, they don't belong.
Choose to attack and we'll fight back.

Broken, no hope left.
Not one voice will be suppressed.
Times have changed, the proof is shown,
we have grown.
Take your leave, you will pay.
Your own brothers you've betrayed.
I'll conceived, your beliefs, there will be just...

[Chorus]
One solution: revolution
[Break your silence, start the violence.]
You've been wronged, they don't belong.
Choose to attack and we'll fight back.

Where do your loyalties lie
when your end is nigh?
How do you expect to survive
in the time of your demise?

Witness rejection, no more protection.
Now and forever in isolation.
