Wasting away, day by day.
Grinding my mind into a slow decay.
If stress builds character I've reached the top.
These unstable thoughts just won't stop.
Pushing myself to the breaking point,
My body aches from every joint.
Battle worn, mentally depleted.
My enemy's lay beaten and defeated.

Gaining strength through my pain.
Virtue flowing through my veins.
Limits pushed, integrity tested.
Never again, my vigor questioned.
Gaining power through your pain.
Unmatched, my will remains.

Lack of sleep, reality fading.
On constant edge, delusions invading.
Never follow the beaten path.
Behind the victims of malice wrath.
Embrace the pain to drive me harder,
A slave to no man, feel this hate I harbor.
No time for rest, I bide my time.
Whatever it takes, I will claim what's mine.

Gaining strength through my pain.
Virtue flowing through my veins.
Limits pushed, integrity tested.
Never again, my vigor questioned.
Gaining power through your pain.
Unmatched, my will remains.
Cast into flames without caution,
Dominance the only option.

Suffer to succeed I push on...
The crown in my sights I will become bestowed upon.

Gripping tight with weathered hands...
The crown of power goes to the hardened man.
