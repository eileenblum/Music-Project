The clothes you wear, the words you speak.
Prove to me that you're fucking weak.
I've seen you before, I'll see you again.
With a different face following different trends.

[Chorus]
Both your faces and their shit-eating grins
create the fury that I'm living in
(I need to break away)
You are the source of my pain...
You ruin what I love and it will never be the same.

You and your kind
will never learn.
Lighting a match
to watch the fire burn.
Don't try to claim your innocence.
Or say your peace
while you walk the fence.

[Chorus]
Both your faces and their shit-eating grins
create the fury that I'm living in
(I need to break away)
...Before I go insane
I'll ruin what you love and you
will never be the same.

Full of fleeting opinions
and temporary convictions,
crusade against the opposition.
Fate lying at the end of a rope.
Played the victim too long,
and now I'm laughing as you choke.
