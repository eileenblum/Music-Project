Feed the urge, take by force.
Scour the depths. No remorse.
Prey off of screams, destroyer of dreams.
Innocence lost, justice unseen.

Inflicting justice....
Punishment you deserve, motherfucker.

Violent procreator,
Scaring forevermore.
Violent procreation,
Promised execution.

Rid the earth of your pathetic existence.
You have been judged, my rage your sentence.
Cut your throat ear to ear.
No pity shown, your end is near.

Violent procreator,
Scaring forevermore.
Violent procreation,
Promised execution.
Silenced masochism,
Hunting nevermore.
Methodically eviscerate,
Revenge of the sufferers.

Inflicted justice...
Forcing your self on the body of another.
Choking the life from your eyes,
And now you die, motherfucker.

Unforeseen predator.
Murderer of character.
So many robbed of innocence,
Undeserving existence.
You've given up your right to keep living your life.
Your final breath will taste the bitterness of the knife.
