Another day... The light fades away.
Punching the clock, another dollar saved.
Buying in to the American Dream.
White picket fence, a life that's so serene.
Childhood dreams diluted memories.
Buried under debt, pay for your pedigree.
Marching in line to the beat of the drum.
Played by capitalists with silver tongues.

A way of life... Never right for me.
I chose the path that's meant to be.
No chains that bind... I'll always be free.

Striving for a better life.
A sense of peace... no pain, no strife.
Watch it flash before your eyes.
Doe alone, no one to hear your cries.

A way of life... Never right for me.
I chose the path that's meant to be.
No chains that bind... I'll always be free.
No fear of death surrounding me.
A life lived under someone else's rule.
Hollow existence lived by a fool.

Your entire life now has gone to waste.
Your name forgotten, your legacy erased.

I refuse to fall to human expectation.
Standard to you is my incarceration.
Prisoner of habit, follow like an addict.
Congregate to the sabbath of the prodigal maggots.

Righteous fear.
