Switchblade romance
This is your last chance
Lines laid down
Soothing sounds
Speeding care ride
No wonder we died
Roses and gasoline
It's just the blood on your hands
You're my rock and roll queen
If this is love go tell your friends
Leather and lace
Another way to make this hurt
Keep me a secret babe your life's on the line
Why must we talk?
This is as close as we get to a song about love
It's not your funeral just yet
This is a close as we get to a song about love
Too bad it's the last day you're alive
I got this one under control
Call me in a week
3 more days and you will see the real me
I feel it coming
Its time to fuck the conversations done
I'm waiting this one out
Keep your head down
I'm waiting this one out
Keep your head down
It's a war zone
Walk this way
Take another time out
Just stay here
Stay here with me tonight
As they're out fighting the good fight
No need to dim down the lights
We all know you've run this road before
Track star record
Waiting in line
I'm waiting this one out
Keep your head down
I'm waiting this one out
Keep your head down
Track star
Rock star
Suck the sweat off
Your futures looking brighter now
Suck the sweat off
Your futures looking brighter now
It's a war zone
Game set and match
Get up
Get out
The score ends in love
The score ends in love
Roses and gasoline
You were my rock and roll queen
I feel it coming
