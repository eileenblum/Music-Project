All right
Let's go
I think its time
This has gone far enough
Would I be out of line?
Shut up just shut up
Close your poison mouth
I don't know why you're here
Something tells me you're not leaving soon
You fucked her now you deal with it
Who cares how hot she is
Let's not make things worse
I've got no problem hitting girls
I don't think that you understand
Why is she even in the van?
This hand will end all discussion
Here's to the red in your eye
We've killed off where regret comes from
I'll be drinking whiskey tonight
Come to
It's the chance I took
Time to stay home
So you cover your face at night
It's really so bittersweet
Who would have thought it would feel this good
You're not so pretty anymore
But you look good
Black and blue
You fucked her now you deal with it
Who cares how hot she is
Now that you've learned your lesson
Maybe you'll stay home instead
Pills and whiskey
Get me through
Next time I see you talking
I hope it's to someone else
