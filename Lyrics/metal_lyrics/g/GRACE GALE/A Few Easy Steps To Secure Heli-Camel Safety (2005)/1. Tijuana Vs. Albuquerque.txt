Lets refuse to write this down, we're only here another day,
Still standing on the cusp, we'll never get to tell this.
Let's burn this house down, before they all see it.
What's right? Cause no one asked.
Better get this done before we get home again to see the ones who know.
There's nothing distinct in this, no time to stay and watch the flames, just run,
It's burning
Just shut your eyes
Watch the ashes
What fun.
This is just a reminder
Goodbye it's on to the next town
Your food will taste better in our van
Don't care what club you say you own
Just worry about your things when you get home (this evening)
One kiss and the doors still open, you taste like a bad decision baby.
These rumors are true, you're mad that not about you
Your kiss capsized this ship wreck; your words killed the men at sea.
In no way is this victim-less, our heart goes to the next sailor whose sucked in.
You're a siren, baby
Let's burn this house down before they all know us.
What's right, cause no one asked.
There's nothing distinct in this, no time to stay and watch the flames, just run,
It's burning
Just shut your eyes
Watch the ashes
What fun.
