One blue one red
I'll take this one instead
You won't miss this at all
Try one on and I'm gone
In and out you won't know
My wardrobe is complete
I'd steal your shirt
I'd steal your pants
I'd steal your shoes
I can't stop
No remorse ever crossed my mind
I'm taking this one home
Who needs the mall when I have you?
I just hope this one fits
I'm wearin 'em now
I'm wearin 'em now
I just can't stop
I can't quit
You won't miss this at all
Don't leave your door unlocked
I've only just begun
I've only just begun
Just because you squeeze in size six
That doesn't mean that it fits
Don't leave your door unlocked
I've only just begun
One more
It's ok
I got time
I'll take this home
I've got your shoes
