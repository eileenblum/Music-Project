We're running out of quarters
Pick up your goddamn phone
We've never been this wet
Black widow in the window
You're always so damn clever
And were wet down to the bone
He comes to keep you warm
This rains so fucking cold
CHARLIE YOU FUCKING BITCH LETS WORK THIS OUT!
Michael Douglas you call that a husband
John Cussack hasn't worked in the last year
T mobile serves the better part of the nation
Vince Larkin believed in Cameron Poe
That sweet ass thing in entrapment
One ski 12 k's he learned in one day
Antonio showed you his swordplay you trollop
For a white dude he looked pretty good with a ghetto blaster
