I know you want me with you
There's four more on the way
It must be the doorbell
Your dreams just might come true
I know you want me with you
Come on dear it's the fad
It must be the doorbell
Can't pay for memories like these
If you like one man
You like the whole band
We'll all share the same bed princess
You wanted it to be special
Your foods safe we barely bathe
We sleep in on Tuesdays
Come on princess its time
Its time we found out for you
Its time we all five of us
Its time we found out for you
All five of us here and now
