I struggle for breath.The intensity of the darkness stifles me, it's impossible for me to lay still.The atmosphere is unbearable.I hope of catching some faint ray of light, but in vain. I am trapped inside, inside this shallow mind.I can't forget the standards that I've set.I know, I cave in. This time I can't win.I walk. I lose it all. I stay and I will fall. I should not compare, but I know what's out there. I can't help myself. Trapped inside. I can't forget the things I've seen.I'm afraid. You can not see what I mean.I just want to know. Can I get over this? Help me, let me go. Where to? I don't know.I need to get the things I don't have yet.It might be too late to see is this my fate.I walk. I will forget. I stay and I regret. Break these chains of mine and free me.I have seen the light. I need to go.Take down these walls around. Ignore me.What's out there to see. I need to know.
