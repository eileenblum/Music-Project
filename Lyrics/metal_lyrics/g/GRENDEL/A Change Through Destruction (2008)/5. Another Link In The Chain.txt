I could see right from the start
you got what it needed
to evolve into a life
you can not leave behind.

Yesterday once again
proved that you were wrong
when you said you're through with it.
Everytime you come around.

Time after time I think you're fine.
You will survive. Just stay in line and you will be all right.

Pain takes over you again. You're another link in the chain.
They predicted. You're addicted. It is true.

Coldness and darkness.
They wear down your soul.
Helpless and useless.
Try to run and you will fail.

You need help. You need a cure.
We are here for you.
You need to feed. You can't refuse.
You have lost your control.
