I've lost the pieces of my life.I've strayed from my path.Years I've paid for my mistakes.I'm stuck to these tracks.There was a time when I had it all.Now I can only hope that you'll catch me when I fall. Help me through this one more time. Save me.Lead me through this one last time. Save me. Please tell me do you call this life?I do not. I'll be gone tomorrow.Don't hate me. It hurts like a knife.I understand. I do deserve my sorrow. I waited way too long.The flame has burned out.Now there's nothing here for me.I can't stay any longer. No.I know you could make it all come back.Please do it before I make my world turn black.
