You think you can hide, you try disguise.You thought you could find some hope in their lies.You're waiting for someone to point you the way.No one hears what you're trying to say. No one hears you. There's no one to talk to.No place to go now. There's no one to show you how. They've been around so long. They should have learned.Our belief in ourselves is strong. The tables have turned.They're waiting for someone to give them a sign.We are alone and we're doing just fine.
