Underneath there's only one desire.It is this one thing that keeps me going on.Long ago the value was discovered.I wonder if I'm worth of possessing it. One desire feeds the fire in my heart. You can't depart. No, no, no. Deep inside I feel that I can do this.Waiting for a chance to prove myself to you.Thousand times you've tried to pull me under.You fail again and this was the last time you tried. Everything else is worthless compared to this.There is nothing... nothing that could compete with it.
