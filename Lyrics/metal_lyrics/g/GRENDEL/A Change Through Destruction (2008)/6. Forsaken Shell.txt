I'm too weak to walk this path all alone.I'm too proud to shame.I'm too scared to make this come to an end.I'm the one to blame. Everyday I feel this voidness. I can't find the way.Everytime I see the answers, I turn away. You're too heartless to make this dream come alive.You're too eager to seclude.You're too cruel to put an end to my road.You're the one to rule.
