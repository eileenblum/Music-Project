Destroy it all.Destroy it all before we reach the wall.Destroy it all.Destroy it all before we all recall. Yes... we need a change.'cause we are sick and the cure is out of rangeand if we could, I don't think you would. Go... dig your own grave.As you can see there's nothing left to save.Go bite the hand that gave you a place to stand. Till the end of time, before we're forced to die.We need to fight it. This is the day when you want to stay.Till the end of time, we expiate our crime.We need to take it. This is the day when you want to pray. One... fate worse than deathis to see you take your final breath.and without you we need to give up too.
