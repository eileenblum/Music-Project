I am here for you.I will make you bleed.Prove to me you're worth it.Take a look inside.Let me burn your eyes.You can't go on without me. You are the one.I want you to stay here for my inspiration.You are the one.I need you to make me feel that I'm alive. I can't stay for long.I must let you breath'til I come back to haunt you.You're too weak for me.You can't take my test.You can't go on...
