Close your eyes, stand still, hold your breath
Enjoy the silence before the fall
Get ready for the last sunset
If you survive, you better make the final crawl

The sound of strident noise is rising
It's time to open your eyes
Known world burning
Wish your loved ones last goodbye

Last goodbye

NO - Mankind is dying
ALONE - Enemy within
NO - Final sentence
Laid upon your soul
Apocalyptic rain

This is the dawn of new world order
It's time to choose your side
No need to beg forgiveness
Find the place where the victims lie

Face the fact, you're dead
Old vicious predictions came true
Apocalyptic rain is falling
First drops fall on you

Fall on you

NO - Mankind is dying
ALONE - Enemy within
NO - Final sentence
Laid upon your soul
Apocalyptic rain
