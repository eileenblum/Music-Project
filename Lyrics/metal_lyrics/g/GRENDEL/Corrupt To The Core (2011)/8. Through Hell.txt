Filled with frustration
Sick and tired to bite the dust
Hatred - Reaction
Wipe out despite the cost

Obey your master
It is time to say goodbye
Rampage - Disaster
Innocents are going to die

Disaster

Time to wake up
We've gone through hell
It's not so easy
Oh we know too well
Out of this nightmare
Away from the pain
We need to get out
We must break the chain

Inside the chaos
There's no room for common sense
Intentions to save us
Will be blocked by his defense

Stop this illusion
Cannot take a moment more
Too much confusion
Tenfold more than before

Cannot take a moment more
Confusion
