Open your eyes now
Open your eyes - Don't be so blind
Try to control your mind
You must defy - Stay true
Resist the lies that they feed you

Bite it - Don't swallow
They're strong - We must be too
Or else they run us through
We need to make them bow
Me must end this here and now

I believe in sin
Not to your lies
You will never win
Prepare to your demise
I believe in sin
Not to your lies
You will never win
You're something that I despise

We rule from now on
Shut your mouth - Don't say a word
You're condemned not to be heard
We rule from now on
Your rights are withdrawn

Controlled us too long
Fold your hands and bow your head
Repeat everything I said
Kneel down in front of me
I'm your new god don't you see
