Counting the days
Are moving on slowly
Feels like the time is standing still
Five years from now will you be strong ?

More sleepless nights
More time to deal with
I draw more marks to my brick walls
Five years from now will you be strong ?

I cry for help
Guess no one can hear me
I never believed it would be so hard
The lack of social connection
I can't live with myself

It was hard to realize
I was doomed to be the one
To live in solitude
Five years without the sun
Now I need to pay the price
To recall what I have done
Live my life inside the box
Five years without the sun

Years pass me by
But still I'm trapped inside
I wonder if days repeat themselves
Five years from now will you be strong ?

I'm trying to see
But darkness fills my sight
I never believed I could be so weak
Nothing will ever be the same
