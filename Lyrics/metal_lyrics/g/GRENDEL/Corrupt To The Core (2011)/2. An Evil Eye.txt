You cannot stop, until you drop
You see it all - The functions out of your control
Memories of yesterday
Soon are gone - They slowly start to fade away

TRY - Feel it burn - Take some more
FLY - It is your turn - Take it all

You're going down in a blink of an eye
Few hours later you fell like you could die
You sold your soul - Goodbye sober day
No time to regret - Now you have to pay

You need to think about the reasons why
You sold your soul for an evil eye
Too late now
You sold your soul

You cannot see - You're on your knees
You loose it all - The abilities of standing still
Attributes of consciousness
Soon are gone - Proceed to a state of disgress

WHY - Last mistake - Now you crawl
CRY - It is your turn - Take the fall
