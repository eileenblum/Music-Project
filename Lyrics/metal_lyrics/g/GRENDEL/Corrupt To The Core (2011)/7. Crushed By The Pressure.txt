It's building up and it's weighting me down
It will never stop until I'm on the ground
Too much as stake - More than I can take
Can afford to loose - But I just can't refuse

Signal of distress - Lost consciousness
They don't hear my call - No one to stop my fall
Fought so hard so long - I guess that I was wrong
Thought I had the time to learn to walk the line

Crushed by the pressure
Forced to desperate measures
Dust is all that's left to burn
Trust me I would not return

I cannot breath but I need to proceed
Trying to ascend - I want to reach the end
On the halfway something pulls me away
All the way back to the start - I feel like torn apart

Only way out is closing down
All I think about is that I'm going to drown
Near and yet so far - Right here you are
All you can do is cry while you're watching me die
