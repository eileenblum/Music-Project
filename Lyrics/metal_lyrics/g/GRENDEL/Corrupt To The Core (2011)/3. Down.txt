Try to find a way of life
That would be the way to go
Didn't matter what you picked
It was wrong that's all I know
Never got a second chance
Never got to use your first
It was cancelled in advance
Just wait - Expect the worst

Down - Down into the darkness
Through the total absence of light
For you it's futile to resist
Follow the path - Do not fight/Going down
You'll be alright

How they gonna make it up
What could compensate your pain
Think about the time you lost
Things you never get back again
Do you know who to blame for this
Find a way to make them pay
No delay- Act as once
Today is judgment day
