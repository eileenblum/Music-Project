Last minute decision - There's no place to hide
Prepared for the collision - The fear grew inside
Recognized the symptoms - Took are of the injuries
Continued the mission - Forgot all the tragedies

Left dead by the process - Blinded by the pain
With all hate that I possess - I beg you would go insane
Waiting for your confession - My patience is running thin
Vengeance is my obsession - I don't know where to begin

Paralyzed inside - Traumatised for life

I need to forget it all - I want to leave it behind me
No matter how hard I fall - I will survive if I can break free
I am standing on my own - But I'm not alone
I would live with no regret - If I can only forget

One after another - I root you out of my mind
This way of the other - I prevent you to remind
Cleared out my memory - Purified my soul
Recreated the story - I hope to gain control

Fought for year to survive it - I think I'm about to win
A million times I wanted - To end this - To give in
Suffocated senses - Burst into flames
Corroded defenses - Load up - Protect our names
