They came from hell
Under Mephisto's spell
They have no skin
the terror begins

They looks round corners
They see without eyes,
They go to you house
Bearing manlike disguise!

Guts!!! Bones!!! Chunks!!! Rot!!!

Skellington Crew
Coming tonight!
Skellington Crew
Give you a fright
Skellington Crew
Haunt you they might!

Their insides are out
Now you will shout!
