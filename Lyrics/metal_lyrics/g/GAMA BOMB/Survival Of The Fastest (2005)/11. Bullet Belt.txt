Thrash titans of yesteryear
They have failed us with their recent piss
We reject their progressive dross
And call it the rot that is truly is
Legions of thrashers
With nothing to thrash to
On the city streets
It's time to fill the thrash vacuum
It's time to thrash like its' '86

Put on your Bullet Belt
Sonic death, your face will melt
Back to reign, here to stay
Thrash you brains or go away

Now we will vaporise the diet metal pansies
The Techno enthusiasts will finally pay for their crimes
A new age for thrash metal is finally at hand
It's time to fill the thrash vacuum
It's time to thrash like its' '86

Put on your Bullet Belt
Sonic death, your face will melt
Back to reign, here to stay
Thrash you brains or go away
