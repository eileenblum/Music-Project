Hilltop fortification, machine-gun nest staffles the approaching attack, legions fleeing out, over the mountains of the dead, fighting in the ruins of the fortified zone.
The fortified zone, the fortified zone, the fortified zone.
Overheating engines, spewing kerosene rocket-bombs exploding all your friends, enemy formations, wrecking up your legs, lying in the ruins of the fortified zone.

The fortified zone, the fortified zone, the fortified zone (fortified zone)

Hilltop fortification, blown to smithereens, screaming death they have you in their sights, for you there is no mercy, blasted in the mind, and rotting on the ruins of the fortified zone.
The fortified zone! [x4]

Attack! Attack! The fortified zone. [x4]
