It's not too late, and I know how
They're closing in on our compound
If you must, do me right
Don't wanna walk into the night

They are rending [sic] flesh from bone
The last outpost, we stand alone
A rotting heart, an empty head
Still they come
The living dead
Scream for mercy!

Suppressive fire can't hold them back
The stakes are high, the dead attack
I'm bleeding wild across the ground
Still I don't dare make a sound
See defences [sic] coming down
The day a madman wears the crown
No emotion on its' face
Brings the end of the human race

Scream for mercy!

It's not too late, and I know how
They're closing in on our compound
Now it's come, do me right
Make it stop
It ends tonight

Now I'm safe inside black dreams
Last escapes from their screams
No emotion, I feel no pain
As they feast, upon my brain!!!
