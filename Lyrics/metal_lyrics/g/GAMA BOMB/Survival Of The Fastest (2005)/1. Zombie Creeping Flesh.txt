Men of science misuse the deceased
Taught them to rip and to slay
Soon they are legions filling the streets
The fool and his flesh part ways

Who is the enemy? Who is you friend?
What is their purpose? We can't comprehend!
Flesh is creeping from the bones of the dead
Look out behind you-they're eating your head!

Guts! Guts! Guts! Guts!
Shock-Ah!

Zombies are drinking our guts tonight
Their faces are pictograms [sic] of rot
Yank out your eyeballs and sup them they might
(But then again maybe they'll not)
