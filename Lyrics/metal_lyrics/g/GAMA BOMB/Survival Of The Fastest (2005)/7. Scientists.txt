They say they wanna cure us
They really want the world
We live in a future time
Mech-Ni-Tronic world,

They learned how at Auschwitz
To freeze up your mind
Looking to the future time
With atomic eyes!

After the apocalypse they took your mind
Abusing science deaf dumb and blind
Nothing but your cruelty exists
Now we bow before the Scientists!!!

They who built the Mechni-Crab
Now wield control
Put your mind in a war machine
As the plans unfold

They learned how at Auschwitz
To freeze up your mind
Looking to the future time
With atomic eyes!

After the apocalypse they took your mind
Abusing science deaf dumb and blind
Nothing but your cruelty exists
Now we bow before the Scientists, Scientists, Scientists?
