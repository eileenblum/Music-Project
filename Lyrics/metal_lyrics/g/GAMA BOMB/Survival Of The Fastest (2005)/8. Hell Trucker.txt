Riding the motorway to
Whence I go Hell is the next stop
With this cargo of souls Only the
Damned are in my boot Speed metal
The floor to my foot yeah!
My iron wheels are crushing steel
The fiery engine screams doom
Nazis flee and go screaming to Hell
Where this highway leads!

I am a Hell Trucker
Laying waste to the road
With a Neutron Bomb
As my load, watch me go

I am a Hell Trucker, bodies on the road
Skulls beneath you will see
As my claw is upon this bomb
The nuclear end thus will be!

I am a Hell Trucker
Laying waste to the road
With a Neutron Bomb
And my load must be blown!
