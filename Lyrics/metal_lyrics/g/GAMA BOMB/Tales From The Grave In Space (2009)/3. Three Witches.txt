A sailor's map in an occult store,
In a place where no shop ever stood before
Making plain that near the old town square
Abandoned ruins still standing there
Scale the wall, smash the lock, tear the ivy back
Break the seal, scale the stair, find them crouching, dressed in black

They'll take all commands, so make your demands
Approach with care, speak if you dare ...
They're blind but they know, so to them we go
So come with me, see witches three

The world is yours, we guarantee
You'll share in immortality
Give your eyes so we might see
Sacrifice for sisters three

Slit your palm and grease the mirror, roll the chicken bones
In the crucible they'll forge your fortune, take instruction from the ancient crones
Like a husband who doesn't wear a ring
Like a thief left alone with a shiny thing
You'll never come to account, just paying one price
They'll grant it all when you scoop out your eyes

Your wishes come true, but what did you do?
Two eyes among three, they command witchery
Lust was your all, now you've got no balls
Eyeballs that is, oh gee what a swizz
