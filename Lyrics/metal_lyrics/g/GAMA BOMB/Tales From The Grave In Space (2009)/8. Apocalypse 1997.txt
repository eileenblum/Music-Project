Livid hands wring rinds of joy from future dwelling life
A ghost of family in every home as society spirals from the light
Patrolling black belly pigs brand identity codes into searing flesh
Reconfigure binary to bring down enemy jets
I robot, resisting arrest
stamping boot that keeps us oppressed
Apocalypse! Who'd have thunk
Humanity! The boat has sunk
Life waiting in line for a virus scan
Your own child will denounce you for having soft hands
Depredations, interrogations where intruder alarms will scream
They're watching you, so smash the screen then shoot to kill â you know what I mean?
Searching scope that snipes at hope
Ramming injustice home
They've washed your mouth out with poison soap
You will report to the justice zone
Can it be there was a time when men and women laid together with the sun upon their skin?
It's just a crime beyond comparison now in a world where thought is sin
Alternate history of a future past where orthodoxy is the law
If you are a man, you are the last, now a victim to the saw
Spotlights scan the rubble sites were the pigs unleash the hounds
To fall in love is the final crime and will bring the truncheon down
