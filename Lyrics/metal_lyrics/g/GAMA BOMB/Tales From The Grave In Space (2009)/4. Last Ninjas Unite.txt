Ninjas! kunoichi and oniwaban unite...
dealing in murder by blowdarts tonight...
your shogun is calling, order is falling...
It's time to strap up and obey the calling...

Shinobi, cast off your farmers apparel...
an old allegiance is needed in the time of D.A.R.Y.L....
put down your sodoku, stick on your shoku...
climb down from your tree and kill people with me...

Fighting! Iron fisted men...
Masked faces drop from above...
All ninjas join forces and hands...
Guerrilla warfare tonight!...

A window is open a mind draws a blank...
A deadly puffer fish is missing from the tank...
A whisper a shadow out in the thickets...
Silent shinigami with his pockets full of crickets...

A man? 'tis a ninja, the mantis strikes!
A large group of peasants are set upon with pikes
A creak right behind your chair...
Blood and bones and teeth and guts and dinner everywhere...

You've murdered your friends and lovers and tramps...
chopped of their heads while backflipping down ramps...
Now back to your hole, there's no time to pause...
cast off your katanas, smoke bombs and claws...

Next time they insult the Ten Tigers of Canton...
they won't find their demise unfounded or wanton...
dishing out dead legs in the bitter chill...
killed you have done, and done well was the kill...
