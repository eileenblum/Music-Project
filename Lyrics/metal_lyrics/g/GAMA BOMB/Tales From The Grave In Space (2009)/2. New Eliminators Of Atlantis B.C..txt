The challenger from a future time
Sentenced to the past for a forgotten crime
They'll perish him for the perfect rights
Down through the years past time and space

Through the stargate, time and space collapse
The legions fly above the mist
Transport them to their trash

Centurions, of the second breed
Robots, powered by pistons steams
A spectacle for you to see
The New Eliminators of Atlantis â B.C.

War spilled in the funeral times
Traited powders cross acid lines
The world will see the battle on the arena floor
Defines like the lasers went come to seal your coming on

Razor gate and lose the beast
The sound of bloody war â war!
Exaggerated Death-face
Means a fly tucked to the sore

Smoking powders, robots mercies, aliens, and jets
The challenger erects, he's screaming "Faces all reflect"
So cast a bomb into the heart, the cities neutrid core
Humanoids a and genesis send to the allstreet floor

In the dying moment the city flows in ash
From out the chaos comes a challenger to vanish in a flash

Atlantis! Atlantis! Atlantis!
