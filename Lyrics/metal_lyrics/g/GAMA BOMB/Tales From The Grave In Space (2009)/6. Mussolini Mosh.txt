MOSH!

âComing over here and taking our jobsâ â no-one really believes that shit
Exploiting indecision to spread their crap, trying to look every bit too legit to quit
But we know a brick through the window in the middle of the night is their real idea of fun
Weâll throw a fit before we submit to scum

Heil and dry
No shelter for you here
BNP, all Nazis
In the crosshairs, you know weâre sincere when we declare
Your feet will dance on air
Your slippery slope to genocide
We know your names, we wonât let it slide
Nazis? Fuck âem!
