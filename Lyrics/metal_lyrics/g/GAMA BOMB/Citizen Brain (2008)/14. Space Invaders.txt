Distant powers, outer space
Evil forces, the human race
Comets landing in your town
Heed the warning, get underground

We fight them on the sea and land
Death-ray turns your face to sand
To wipe the earth of humans clean
They are evil, short, green

Visitors came and promised peace
On human cattle now they will feast
Don't ask for mercy, they won't comply
So bolt your doors and watch the sky
To Serve Man, they landed here
Burning through the upper atmosphere
Sucking out guts with a lizard's eyes
So bolt your doors and watch the sky
Watch the sky

Push the button, set the charge
Sending our rockets to wipe out Mars
Cities burned, armies fell
Planet Earth becomes a living hell
