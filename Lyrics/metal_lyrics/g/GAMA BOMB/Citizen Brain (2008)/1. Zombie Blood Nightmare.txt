Drinking and dancing and female nudity
Dancing round the bonfire as they weave their witchery
Disembrained bodies coming back from the dead
Disembowelled hands take the brains from your head
Because once you look into their eyes
You'll see their faces is full of worms
A heap of guts in clever disguise
Their aim to make you zombified

No! (No!) It can't be you, you're dead! (Dead!)
No! (No!) You can't bury me, I'm alive! (Alive!)

Lusting for treasure and killing for wealth
Enslaving the natives and toasting your health
Drums of the voodoo gods are sounding out in the swamp
Resurrection ritual, it's you that they want
Once you look into their eyes you'll soon become a ghoul of gore
Zombies teach cannibals to be afraid
They're cruel like never before

Approaching the plantation at the setting of the sun
Now you'll see before your eyes what voodoo rites have done
Retiring to your mansion to count your wealth once more
Fingernails will scratch the pine as you're throwing back the door to say...
