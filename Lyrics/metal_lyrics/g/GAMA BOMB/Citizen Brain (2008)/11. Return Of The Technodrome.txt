In a steel beast that lives underground
A despot, a madman, they plot
The eye of the Technodrome, the all-seeing eye
Prepares for the coming attack

Banished to Dimension X, they
swore they would return
Rock soldiers, Mutants, kill as one
Living ball of steel rolling through the town
Hypnotising eye returns from 'neath the ground
Limit of our powers surely soon we'll find
Terror of the technodrome shafts us from behind

There's a vortex in the sky, they'll drain out the power
And plunge our world to black
Behind the plan, a brain with a face
Prepares the final attack

Sai and swords, bo and flails cannot stop them this time
Return of the fly, fight, fly or die
Drive them back to hell
