The city is stunned, a madman is loose
He's brandishing a mallet for malleting heads
Victims are mounting in alleys and lanes
Where are the police now this madman is loose?

Hammer! Hammer!
Hammering at will
Slammer! Slammer!
Slamming for thrills
Hammer! Horror!
That is my game
Hammer! Slammer!
That's my name

Striking by night in the canyons of town
Attacked in the back, he brings the sledge down
Being mashed up by a bloodthirsty clown
A mentally mad killer of murderous renown

I drive victims into the ground like nails into a bit
of wood
Every day I'm on the news but none of them has

understood
I watch TV, what do I see?
A useless world that's full of shit
I like my job, I'm good with tools
I'll fix society bit by bit

The city is stunned, a hammer is slammed
Swinging from a string from a blood-soaked hand
Victims at random, smacked for thrill
Madness without pattern that's continuing still
