Riding the motorway to whence I go
Hell is the next stop with this cargo of souls
Only the damned are in my boot
Speed metal, the floor to my foot
My iron wheels are crushing steel
The firey engine screams doom
Nazis flee and go screaming to hell
Where this highway leads

I am a hell trucker
Laying waste to the road
With a neutron bomb as my load
Watch me go

I am a hell trucker, bodies on the road
Skulls beneath you will see
As my claw is upon this bomb
The nuclear end thus will be
