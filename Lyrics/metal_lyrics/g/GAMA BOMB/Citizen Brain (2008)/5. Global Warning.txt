Mankind laughed and nature wept
Through alarm bells we have slept
We brought this upon ourselves
Pollution made the icecaps melt
We plundered forests for our need
When not at war we fuelled our greed
Looking out for the human race
We poisoned sea and cluttered space

With acid rain pouring from the sky
Land engulfed in the rising tide
No heed paid to this noble warning
The end result is a global warning

Summer gets hotter every year
In fifty more no tigers here
Houses slipping into the sea
Millions sinking in poverty
They drilled the mines before we were born
Turned our trees to stacks of porn
With fag butts all across the ground
No trees for hugging now

Many treaties that we broke
Morning air that makes us choke
We made money our deity
But caring for the planet was our responsibility
Nobody knows how high the price
To create some future paradise
It's your grandchild in an oxygen mask
Staring out the window at the back of the class
