Thrash titans of yesteryear, they have failed us with their recent piss
We reject their progressive dross, call it rot that it truly is
Legions of thrashers with nothing to thrash to on the city streets

It's time to fill the thrash vacuum
It's time to thrash like it's '86

Put on your bullet belt
Sonic death your face will melt
Back to reign, here's to say
Thrash your brains or go away

Now we will vaporise the diet metal pansies
The techno enthusiasts will finally pay for their crimes
A new age for thrash metal is finally at hand

Gama Bomb Lineup:
Philly Byrne - Vocals
Luke Graham - Guitar
Domo Dixon - Guitar
Joe McGuigan - Bass, Vocals
Paul Caffrey - Drums
