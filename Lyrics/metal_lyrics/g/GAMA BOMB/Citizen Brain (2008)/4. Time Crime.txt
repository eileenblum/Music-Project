Napoleon Blownapart, 1610 -
Martin Luther, they did it again
World War Two, 1945 - tourists from the future, they did not survive Panzers at Hastings,
1066 - we fought with lasers, they fought with sticks
Nuking the Romans in 238,
Enslaving the Cavemen in times before date

Strange confusion in space and time
Today, tomorrow, they blur the lines
Yesterday could be tomorrow's today
But yesterday could be tomorrow too

A knight with an Uzi, that makes no sense
With mammoths and Mongols there is no defence
Hitler meets Caesar, Stalin and Nero
They're building a robot, so don't be a hero

Tyrannosaurus rampage in London town
Jack The Ripper wears the Russian crown
Stonehenge ruined in a hail of rockets
Shakespeare's eyes - pulled from the sockets
