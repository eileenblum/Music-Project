Another Friday night in trousers tight, no money sense or plan 
The demon drink will see you right, scuttered to a man 
Not for you the affluence that lies beyond the velvet rope 
The chateau in the gutter's your only hope 
You had your pints and pissed your kacks 
They pulled you by the ear, you couldn't stand your ID off by years 

Drinking- ready, willing and able 
Sinking- See you under the table 

Here's something for you all 
Don't fear your beer, just get involved 
If you're proud to be inebriate 
It's coming straight into your face 
Like a wrecking ball 

Now the night is young, you're highly strung, you're drinking wine and schnapps 
The yuppie life is the only life, you think it's such a laugh 
Your nouveau riche and eating quiche, you're cashing in and cooking books 
But too much coke is ruining your looks 
You rake it in and live in sin 
You're playing futures in your prime 
You're pissing up on borrowed time 

You want the finest cakes, the finest wines, 
You want here and now 
Just like the bull loosed from the gate 
Who wants to have sex with those cows 
You'll take the bastard axe to anybody in your way 
No matter what the bar tab is you'll gladly pay 
Throw yourself into the road escaping this hideousness 
Hanging ever since you had your fiftieth
