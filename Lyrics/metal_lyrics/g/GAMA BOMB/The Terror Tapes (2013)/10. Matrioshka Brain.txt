Am I a projection? Am I just a brain in a jar? 
Like a cat in a box, neither dead or alive, 
Can anybody say who we are? 
The world that you see, it is not really real 
The minute that you let down your guard 

A meteorite comes from outer space 
The harbinger of a stellar scream, 
Blazing a trail through the ancient skies, 
Nostradamus- the fever dream 

I feel like I'm floating in space
You, me, the entire human race 

They've got the power to shut the sky 
Everything can be undone 
My apocalyptic dread is intensified 
Burning as bright as the sun 

Is this simulation of the universe 
More complex than we could conceive
Cryptic symbols spell Atlantean code 
Computing at incredible speed 

Light in the sky- Look for the sign 
They vowed to return- For you and I 
A system error- The Dyatlov Pass 
The coming terror- the Men in Lead Masks! 

Nostradami, drawing near 
So many predictions, 
Run in fear 

Gaining the power to punch a hole 
Right through this reality's heart 
Who can say who made us this way 
Will they reset the system to start? 
A visitation- the edge of space 
A computation- lost without a trace 
Our civilization- just guinea pigs 
Something is out there- something big! 

Nostradami, drawing near 
So many predictions, 
Run in fear
