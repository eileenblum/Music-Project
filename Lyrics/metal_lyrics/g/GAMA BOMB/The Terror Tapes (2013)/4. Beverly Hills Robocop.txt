Supercop from motor city transferred into town 
Shot to bits and resurrected, out to bring disorder down 
Leather jacket, shining chrome, cruising down the boulevard 
He's cold as ice and twice as hard 

Walking slow and talking wise, 
An Auto 9 in his Levis 
You killed me but I came back to life 
You thrill me so come one, let's party like it's 1985 

He has no name, he plays the game 
Shooting up the party scene 
Directives four, he knows the score 
He's half man and half machine 

State of the art- bang bang! 
It's not what, it's who you know 
If you wanna serve the public trust 
Call 9-1-1 or 9-0-2-1-0 

I came to murder Ronny Cox, Ronny Cox is my boss 
I have no wife, my wife is gone, I'm here to kill Steve Berkoff 
I'm posing as a journalist working for the OCP 
You'd buy that for a dollar? Get the fuck outta here! 
Hands of steel and a cheeky grin, 
Ferrari wheels and a metal skin 

Special chair, loves to swear, grieving wife, 
Back to life
OCP, banan-ee, tail pipe gag, 
Empty mag
Arm shot off, likes to scoff, silly laugh, 
Abandoned gaff 
Good at shootin', robe- a-lootin', Rolling Stone, 
No-one's home 
Baby food, knows the hood, warehouse ruse, 
Metal shoes
Cobra cannon, no right angles, supercop, 
Cocaine drop 
Inspector Todd, Clarence Bodd', Judge Reinhold
His face is cold 
Read the rights of rudeness in the first degree 
Dead or alive, you're coming with me 

Searching for the sweet narc action hidden in coffee grounds 
Play it straight, stay outta trouble, Supercop's around 
Dining out on baby food, I always work alone  
Microchips and coils of wire replaced my flesh and bone
