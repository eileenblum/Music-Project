Slip your penny in the slot, you're tall enough to ride
Screw your eyes up nice and tight and take a peek inside
You'll see the scary world that's sort of right behind the normal one
Where goblin Nazis rule the world and lava rivers run 

Look into my Terrorscope, I dare you not to see
I promise you no black ring around the eye for thee 
Turn the crank and bring to life just what the butcher saw 
Black magic lantern is projecting horrors on the walls 

Spiral to the other side
In my Terrorscope 
Guaranteed to petrify 
It's my Terrorscope

You'll see crudely doodled demons clippity-clopping their cloven feet 
Or a Herbie Goes Bananas full of people you don't wanna meet 
A spooky realm of badly thought-up terror lurking in the lens
Such creepy and quite shoddy evil coming back again 

Spiral to the other side
In my Terrorscope
Guaranteed to petrify 
It's my Terrorscope 
Clear to see for those who'll die 
You'll be horrified 
It's all in the eye of my Terrorscope 

Look in the abyss too long, it looks back you see
What is real and what is no is not too clear with me 
My big long fingers beckon you, I glide you to your seat 
Reality's a nightmare now, you're seeing it clearly
