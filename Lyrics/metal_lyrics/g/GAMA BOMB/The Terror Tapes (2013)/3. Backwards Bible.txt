Congregation of witchery that reads from Satan's book 
Wearing pointy hats in the night 
Its pages can snap your mind with just one look 
Tonight is the last day of my life 
Triangle embroidered on his hat 
His hand is covering one evil eye 
So worship or die 

See how our evil black magic backwards talk you makes 
My trousers are on upside down 
Tell them who sent you when you get to hell's gate 
Such evil will turn your kacks brown 
Liturgy of The Serpent Saint 
It sounds like the Omen OST, like Christopher Lee 

E-L-B-I-B 
The backwards bible for you and me 
B-I-B-L-E 
The book of demonology 
Bless the evilness 
Eternal doom, now there's the rub 
N-A-T-A-S 
Spells Beelzebub 

He's reading the bible from the back to the front 
And upside down in a mirror 
He's flicking the bathroom lights on and off 
And screaming bloody murder 
He's rubbing his stomach and patting his head 
Flushing the toilet and raising the dead 
He's counting backwards from five down to nought 
He's reading a spell from the pamphlets he bought
