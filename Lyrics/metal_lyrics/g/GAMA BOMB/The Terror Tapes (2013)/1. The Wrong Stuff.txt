On a frozen night in the countryside 
Topless drinking men defended their pride 
The concept of a good time taken to extremes 
Negligent games with a manly theme 
Nudist capers powered by grog 
Chainsaw dares, are you man enough to pull the plug? 
You have done something to your brain, you have made it high 
Why trust one drug above the other, that's politics right? 

You got hold of something strong and you put it in your head 
You sniffed or drank or shot it up, you ran a mile and shit the bed
You're coming up the helter-skelter, look out above 
You never know enough's enough 

Escalation, taking a turn for the worse
Self-decapitation, the only way to prove your worth 

You can scream and shout, 
But you got hold of the wrong stuff, you can't deny 
You're on the way out, 
Yes, no, maybe you got stupefied 

No matter if you're too poor to shite 
Get high as the proverbial, every single night 
It's a deadly buzz and you can't stop screaming 
You're chewing your own head and no, you're not dreaming 
Over the falls without ever leaving the room 
There's something unpleasant coming soon 

Robocop told you winners don't use drugs 
But now you've got the munchies for your own face- holy fuck! 
You're naked, roaring, drinking hand sanitizer from a boot 
Time to face the truth 
You've had a trouser accident and you're smearing tonight 
Something's just not right 

Sadly, you're no longer legit 
Hold on, something smells a bit like human shit 

You can scream and shout, 
But you got hold of the wrong stuff, you can't deny 
You're on the way out, 
Yes, no, maybe you got stupefied 

Look here, everybody does drugs from time to time 
But you, sir, have failed to keep this lesson top-of-mind
