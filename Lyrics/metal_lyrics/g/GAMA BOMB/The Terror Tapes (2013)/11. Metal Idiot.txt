I saw this fella with a skinhead at the front row of the show 
He's telling me come down, he's shrieking, freaking everybody out 
His brain is fried, you can tell it from the look in his eye 
Local Nazis, why'd you bother wanna waste my time? 

Come here to play a show, now local Mussolini wants a go 
Do what we want, when we want, we're not competing with Neanderthals
Someone called security, they're watching me like I'm Jacky O 
This is how it's gonna go

If you want a picture of the future it's a kick in the face 
You're all alone in this place 
Clinging to the past, you're a total disgrace 
You're no master race 

Here's a lesson, you can speak your mind but it's never trouble-free 
If you've got a brain you know it's your responsibility 
Don't turn your cheek if someone's talking shit 
The human race will thank you for it 

If anybody says you're preaching tell them silence is consent 
The voice of reason is a weapon, you've gotta use it with just one intent 
The paranoia, persecution, preconception, don't be in any doubt 
You've gotta say fuck 'em- stamp it out
