Urchin from the gutter, in this town you'll go far 
From tender age you've built the rage, who cares who you are? 
We'll gather up the children, put Walkmen in their ears 
Singing soon a different tune, we'll give you purpose down here
We're plying them with Pepsi cola, Gameboy on demand 
Training hard and wearing masks, they'll get radical on our command 
Soon they're stealing TVs, automatic VCRs 
Wearing Jordans, striking out, a ninja school is what we are 

Don't make me tell you twice 
Play the deadly game 
A word to the unwise 
It'll all go down in flames 
We started the fire that burned this city down 
We started the fire that stopped the world from spinning 'round 

We control the subway system, our clothes are black 
Mr. Big rewards the kids, they're drinking Tab and snorting crack 
It's written in the pogs you know, the end is drawing nigh 
Mark the ruins Zero Year for nineteen eighty-nine 
Roughing up commuters, the gutter is our bed 
There's a flaming arrow pointing to here and now, it's in our head 
Danger in our mission, so you better bring a rope 
You may have to scale a building, or have somebody by the throat 

Gutter snipe- rule the streets, Savage 
digs- under siege, Hitting hard- killer 
teens, and now we're, Arsonists- 
stealing cars- Murderers- burning bars
Perjurers- sexual
