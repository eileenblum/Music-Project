Lightning quick like a kick in the dick 
Like a bolt right out of the blue 
The G-force pounds with the throttle down 
At the turning of the screw 
Accelerating, limit breaking 
Propelled by sonic boom 

Burn out- send the signal from mission control 
Vanishing point- hit the desk 'cause the bird as flown 
Ignition- Let the tape run on 
'Cause the worst is yet to come 

Get high! Get high! 
Get unbelievably high! 
Terrific speed, the atom seed 
Taken to the sky 

Outpacing, racing like a cheetah fleeting, streaking into the black
Daring, soaring, blazing a trail, they say he'll never be back 

Nitro- push the needle into the red 
Thrusters- you're hanging on by a thread 
Light speed- tell all the folks back home, 
Son you're on your own 

Techno fallschirmjÃ¤ger soaring faster than a shark with a gun
Spearing through the firmament- but something's wrong 
Neutron- don't cross the streams 
Detonate- the whole world can hear the screams 
Impact in three, two, one 
That son of a bitch was a legend of speed
