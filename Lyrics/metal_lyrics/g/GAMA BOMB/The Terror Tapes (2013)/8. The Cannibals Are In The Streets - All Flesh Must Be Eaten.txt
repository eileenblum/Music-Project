Last night I had the strangest dream about the day when it all came down 
There were figures writhing and a bell was chiming and fire was engulfing the town 
Last night I awoke with a scream to discover it all had come true 
I was strapped to a chair and someone was there, he showed me a terrible view 

Feast! Feast! Feast your eyes! 
Your foot comes out your mouth 
Shocked and horrified 
Cruelty is what it's all about 

Feast your eyes on the world that's sure to come 
New world order that eats the older one 

One man's poison- another man's meat 
Did you never learn- Nothing's for free 
Confronted by such savagery
It's time to ask yourself what you believe 

Last night I shed my skin and howled like a wolf in the zoo 
Contagious lunacy swept the world and mayhem did ensue 
People eating skin and screaming keeps the axels greased 
The president is drinking blood from a skull, here's to the founder of our feast 

Last night I had the strangest dream 
It felt like I was losing the plot 
The world is ending, 
The sky was descending, 
And someone had reset the clock 
Listen to the chanting, churning rhythm, deeply disturbing, there's no returning
Look in the mirror and see, the cannibals are you and me
