The weed, the weed, the snot green weed
Into Davy Byrne's we'll sit us down and have a feed
Rolling up a pinner sitting on the Daniel Day,
Finnegan's bakeâsmoke weed every day
Portrait of the artist as a young Rastafah
Living after midnight in the Phoenix Park
The fella offa star trek is the fella from the van
By the Royal Canal we will have another hot can

Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Joints joints joints!

A wandering rasta
Disgusted by pasta
The Citizen is fast but Leo is faster
Stephen is the student and Jah is the master
The ghost is the father smoke blow cos he hasta

James Joints
The compass points
Dirty old town
Smoke the brown
swim on the shore
in doobalin 4
off your gourd in the penisulate wars
