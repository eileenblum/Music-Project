We are orphans of the nuclear fire
We are ashen leather primitives
Racing neon motorbikes you can hear us scream
Beyond the outer limits

NitroglycerinâWarmachine
...nightâFinal fight
AccelarateâInfiltrate
Secret codeâPowerload

After the fire
Worship the all-seeing eye
Violent desire
Look me in the eye and say you're not afraid to die

Strapped across the chassis of this war machine
Seven hundred miles across
In the night we fight the rats and chase the mutants underground
It is wee who paid the cost to be the boss

Shaving headsâLiving dead
CounterstrikeâMotorbikes
Future warâWhat we are
Gasolineâ...

After the fire
Worship the all-seeing eye
Violent desire
Look me in the eye and say you're not afraid to die

Nitro fuelled diesel power pumping in our hearts
Everybody's coming to New York
I cannot wait until I'm dead my head and body part
It means absolutely nothing to us

Down I goâHammerblow
Losing gripâ...the switch
Sacrificeâ...
Happy daysâ...

After the fire
Worship the all-seeing eye
Violent desire
Look me in the eye and say you're not afraid to die
