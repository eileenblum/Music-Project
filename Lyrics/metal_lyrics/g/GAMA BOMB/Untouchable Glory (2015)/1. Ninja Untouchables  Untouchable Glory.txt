We'll see you at the leather bar, shirts without sleeves
Revving our imaginary motorbikes, the only thing we can believe
Pouring drinks so wildly down the crotches of our jeans
Too seedy for the crazies, too crazy for the scene
Looking at the world we'll see you darkly in the morn
We gave away our underwear, commando evermore

Don't touch me
I don't know where you've been
Can't you see?
It's the serpent just beneath the skin
They say we crossed the line, they say we're irresponsible
But we are untouchable

People are afraid of us because we've got ninja skills
Ninja skills is a relative term, be like us - get on the pill
Dare you to approach us you can expect to hear it all
Comparisons to terminator are not unreasonable
See us dancing serious, hear the Tech Noir beat
Loosening the bullets that hold you in your disbelief

Don't touch me
I don't know where you've been
Can't you see
It's the serpent just beneath the skin
They say we crossed the line, they say we're irresponsible
But we are untouchable

We'll take you to a room where men are training day and night
Our jackets have no sleeves at all, not even in the winter time
Businessmen will join us with their ties around their heads!
You can join our gang of course you can, but first we'll kill you dead

Don't touch me
I don't know where you've been
Can't you see?
It's the serpent just beneath the skin
They say we crossed the line, they say we're irresponsible
But we are untouchable
