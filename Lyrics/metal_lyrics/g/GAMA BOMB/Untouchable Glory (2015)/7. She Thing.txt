Deadly nightshade on the lizard lips of the female of the species
A lady killer's neon claws will tear you into pieces
There's a midnight disco in the graveyard
There's a lightning bolt in her hair
Where voodoo dogs drink human blood
You'll find her there

Scream for mama
Scream all you like
You're in for the ride of your afterlife
She's the beauty and the beast
She's the mother and the child

Gin vermouth formaldehyde
She thing gone wild
Ladies first frankenstyle
She thing gone wild
Troublemaker, problem child
She thing gone wild
Mark of the beast sign of the times
She thing gone wild

Go-go dancing skeletons pour martini from their mouths
Oil projected psychedelic horror that's just too far out

Scream for mama
Scream all you like
You're in for the ride of your afterlife
She's the beauty and the beast
She's the mother and the child

Gin vermouth formaldehyde
She thing gone wild
Ladies first frankenstyle
She thing gone wild
Troublemaker, problem child
She thing gone wild
Mark of the beast sign of the times
She thing gone wild
