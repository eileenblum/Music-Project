If you're on the scratcher and you're sitting on your hole
Take heart you better get smart
If you've only got a fiver and you wanna lose control
Be wise you gotta improvise
At the bottom of the fridge you'll find the answer to your prayers
Drink it neat and take it to the street
Bargain basement booze that'll give you curly hairs
Ice cold, Dutch Gold

Busted jocks
Wasted nights
Empty pockets
Tools and pipes
Sleeping rough
Jocks and hash
Toothless nights
Out of cash

Bless me father for I have gin
It went straight to my head
Drunk all day
Drunk all night
I'm tired and I wanna go to bed

In the great outdoors in the middle of December
Numb toes with your ass exposed
Throwing up in the canal it's a night you won't remember
Rites of passage feeling massive
Your tongue goes numb you got smoke in your eye
Pouring down your neck, you're a wreck
Drinking under bridges because such you're a classy guy
Feeling right, getting super tight

Busted jocks
Wasted nights
Empty pockets
Tools and pipes
Sleeping rough
Jocks and hash
Toothless nights
Out of cash

Bless me father for I have gin
It went straight to my head
Drunk all day
Drunk all night
I'm tired and I wanna go to bed

Next day when you wake up and you feel like human dirt
On the bathroom tiles, can't smile
Curry from the chipper down the front of your shirt
Such bright light, it's just not right
Piecing it together like columbo on a case
Your brain is shot, crying quite a lot
There's only one solution to the terror on your face
Another can's your only man

Busted jocks
Wasted nights
Empty pockets
Tools and pipes
Sleeping rough
Jocks and hash
Toothless nights
Out of cash

Bless me father for I have gin
It went straight to my head
Drunk all day
Drunk all night
I'm tired and I wanna go to bed
