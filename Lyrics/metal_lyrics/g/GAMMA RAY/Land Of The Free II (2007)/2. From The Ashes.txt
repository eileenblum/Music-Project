Now the time is here again
I'm calling you my friends
from the ashes we must rise

and it's been for much too long
now that everything went wrong
like the eagle we must fly

ooh the seal is torn
the seed is sown
ooh, we are coming

And we rise like phoenix from the ashes
let us go where no man's gone before
and we don't need your tomorrow
we're the kids of yesterday
and our spirit will remain forevermore

We're rising again

What's the use of living in a world that changes fast
I cannot see the good side of the progress
beyond the icy glitter world
our hearts are beating fast
a storm released to hammer on the fortress

your time has come
ooh, your world is done
it's time to meet the maker
ooh, we are coming

And we rise like phoenix from the ashes
let us go where no man's gone before
and we don't need your tomorrow
we're the kids of yesterday
and our brotherhood is here forevermore

We're rising again

....uuh, like phoenix from the ashes
we will go where no man's gone before

Rise like phoenix from the ashes
let us boldly go where no man's gone before
we don't need your tomorrow
we will do it our own way
and the world belongs to us forevermore

We'll rise,
we will go where no man's gone before
to hell with your tomorrow
we'll do it our own way
and our spirit will remain forevermore

so keep your dreams of progress
you cannot win at all
the spirit will remain forevermore

Rising again
