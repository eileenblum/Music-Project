The sun is going down, the curtain's falling
The heat is rising now, the master's calling
Into the night I thunder, into the dead of night
and I will head the calling and leave it all behind

The holy man has lost the grail, signs of love from yesterday
the eyes of god of have turned away, the dream became alive
all my life I've waited for the yearning in my heart
right out there I see a star, the sun is going down

Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
drink the poison , listen to your heart
Feed the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fire

My heart is crying out, the fever rising
no one can stop me now, it's meserizing
I break the chains that bind me, the chaos in my life
I leave the world behind me and live in my own mind

A holy land, another shore, no more pain and no more war
she's calling me from far away, makes me feel alive
here I stand in front of her, losing my disguise
no regrets, I'm standing there, waiting for the bite

Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
drink the poison , listen to your heart
Feed the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fire

Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
feel the poison , flowing through your heart
Kiss the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel her fiery Love

Another life,a different way, signs of life from yesterday
the memory will fade away, the dream became alive
here I stand in front of you, tearing off the lies
no regrets, I'm standing tall, I now am free to bite

Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
drink the poison , listen to your heart
Feed the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fire

Kiss the princess, Empress of the dark
drink the poison ,listen to your heart
Kiss the Princess, Empress of the dark
All shall feel the fiery Love
