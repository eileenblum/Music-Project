Bodies lie around me, only shells left from the fight
victims of the ones that turn the day into the night
survivors stumble through the field,they're calling for the priest
branded with a sign, the number of the beast
it's Hell!

I can't escape the nightmare that's here before my eyes
a prisoner of destiny, a victim of the night
my thoughts, they move in circles, I'm heading for the fall
they tell me hope dies last, but I got no hope at all

So talk to me, the world I see
has reached the point of no return
the tons of grief killed my belief
my heaven's on fire and it burns

When the world's on my shoulders
and the pain comes again
then I wish I could be there
in my dreamland again
There I'm free from the madness
without chains and no wall
When the world's on my shoulders
I will pray for you all

Is someone there to save us from the voices in the dark
the words fly out like bullets, they leave a deadly mark
the mindless kill their agony with prices from the show
they're heading for tomorrow, but they don't know where to go

So talk to me, the world I see
has reached the point of no return
the tons of grief killed my belief
my heaven's on fire and it burns

When the world's on my shoulders
and the pain comes again
then I wish I could be there
in my dreamland again
There I'm free from the dark
and I'm safe from the wall
When the world's on my shoulders
I will pray for you all

So if you talk to me now about our belief
and all the meaning somehow
is to make people free
All our lives we fear, to be what we hate
breaking this curse with a fire
that burns all the darkness away

Save me, Hold me, Help me
Free me, Love me, Heal me

When the world's on my shoulders
and the pain comes again
then I wish I could be there
in my dreamland again
There I'm free from the dark
and I'm safe from the wall
When the world's on my shoulders
I will pray for you all
