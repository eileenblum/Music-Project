Come on down into the basement of my temple
I show you things I cannot even tell
the fallen dreams that were made of good intention
wherever people got their soul to sell

A Romeo is standing bleeding in the corner
He cannot die, he cannot live alone
the dagger in the hands of one desperate woman
oh Juliet, why couldn't you forgive

Oh no, here it comes again
my mind is set for freedom now
so let the ball begin
let the ball begin

Leaving Hell
I'll build a new tomorrow
say farewell
'cause you can't lock me in
Time to go
I'm leaving without sorrow
kiss my Ass goodbye
'cause we will never meet again

And now my ship is leaving for the open water
I set my course toward the island in the sun
and if I die no one can say I haven't tried
to keep my dream alive when I was on the run

and I say oh, here I go again
my mind is set for freedom now
so let the ball begin
let the ball begin

Leaving Hell
I'll build a new tomorrow
say farewell
'cause you cannot lock me in
Time to go
I'm leaving without sorrow
kiss my Ass goodbye
'cause we will never meet again

I say oh, here I go again
my mind is set for freedom now
so let the ball begin
let the ball begin

Leaving Hell
I'll build a new tomorrow
say farewell
'cause you cannot lock me in
Time to go
I'm leaving without sorrow
Kiss my Ass goodbye
'cause we will never meet again
no, never again!
I'm leaving Hell
