Hey, this world's a dying planet
nothing matters, nothing's won
I have come to seek revenge
for all that you have done

Hate and fear, eternal sadness
nothing matters, no one cares
I am here to stop the madness
free you from despair

Once I heard the white dove sing
it was the sound of peace
beauty dies in agony
crushed under debris

She was so beautiful
she was a dream
and when I cry for her
I hear them scream..

No respect, no heart for nature
led by greed they tear our soil
ripped, the sky, the damage major
the air is at the boil

Here create another wasteland
on and on 'til nothing's there
here it comes, the devastation
poisoning the air

Once I saw the eagle fly
it was the sound of peace
beauty dies in agony
crushed under debris

She was so beautiful
she was a dream
and when I cry for her
I hear them scream..

You were so beautiful
you were a dream
all we shall heed the call
shall be redeemed

She was so beautiful
she was a dream
and when I cry for her
I hear them scream..
Oh Mother Earth
You were so beautiful
just like a dream
all we shall heed the call
shall be redeemed
Yeah!
