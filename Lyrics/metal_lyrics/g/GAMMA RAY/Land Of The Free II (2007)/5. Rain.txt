My mind is darkened by a demon in my soul
My life is empty and my heart is getting cold
My hope is dying by things I used to see

So much confusion - I'm down on my knees
To find a solution - I want to break free

Look through the eyes of time and finally you will see
The broken dreams and all the pain and tragedy
My mind is asking, will I ever find the key?

So much confusion - I'm down on my knees
To find a solution - I want to break free

Here comes the rain again, falling on my head
My mind is dark again, it's gonna make me mad
Here comes the rain again, crawling like a snake
It's like a thunderstorm, I can not escape
Possession, possessed

And when the curtain falls they still don't realize
Who cries for children, when there's no one left to cry?
Who's proud of victories, when all the love has died?

So much confusion - I'm down on my knees
To find a solution - I want to break free

Here comes the rain again, falling on my head
It's like a thunderstorm, it's gonna make me mad
Here comes the rain again, crawling like a snake
Here comes the rain again, I can not, I can not escape

I try, but it's so hard to find
Wiping the tears of my mind
I cried for the pain deep inside
Where is my blue sunny sky?
... and where the fuck is my Superman outfit???

So much confusion - I'm down on my knees
To find a solution - I want to break free

Here comes the rain again, falling on my head
My mind is dark again, it's gonna make me mad

Here comes the rain again, no more, no more
It will not bring me down, no more, no more

So let me dry the tears and then I will arise
Out in the sunlight see me fly
See me fly
