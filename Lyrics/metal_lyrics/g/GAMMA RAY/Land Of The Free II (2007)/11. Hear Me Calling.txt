I 'm high over mountains
I conquer the stormy seas
I 'll capture your fortress
Bring you down on your knees

I'm living the dream
Break the chains of oppression from you
In the Land of the Free
I am calling for you

I might come with thunder
I might come with rain
The choice's not given
I will master your pain

The edge of a dream
See the glimpse of a new horizon
Life is not what it seems
Oh, can't you see

Hear me calling on the wind
Can't you feel the change begins
Hearts of truth will freedom bring
I'm calling on the wind

Hear my prayer
Where's the saviour
Voice of anger will echo with force

Watch the sunrise
Taste of freedom
Heart is bleeding
I ride through the eye of the storm

Hold on to your dreams
Say farewell to the grand illusion
Blinded eyes never see
In the Land of the free

Hear me calling on the wind
Can't you feel the change begin
Hearts of truth will freedom bring
I'm calling on the ...

Hear me calling on the wind
Can't you feel the change begin
Hearts of truth will freedom bring
I'm calling on the wind
On the wind
On the wind
