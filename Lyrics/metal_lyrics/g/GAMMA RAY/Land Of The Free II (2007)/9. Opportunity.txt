Opportunity came to my door
when I thought I might need a ride
but I said I'm doing alright
turn around and start to see

Yeah, life is boring- Monday,Tuesday
The machines are roaring-Wednesday,Thursday
Friday, and the rain keeps falling
just like everyday

Time is running-Saturday, Sunday
when there's gonna be some holiday for you?
and time flies, time flies, time flies, time flies

I could be a rich man and I could be a superstar
yeah, what's the aim and what's the plan
please just leave again

Set me free, yeah I wanna live it up
and let me be all that I wanna be
cause the whole world in my hands is down
and nothing will last
oh bring back the harmony

Sweating, nightmares - no way to escape
no, I can't sleep
I'm going down in a sea of madness
Raging anger- Hell or paradise
deep in my dreams
no escape for you, no escape for me

Time flies-gotta think it over
Time flies-better think again
Time flies-living in the real world
Time flies-or living on the edge

I should be a wise man, don't need to be a superstar

Set me free, yeah I wanna live it up
and let me be all that I wanna be
cause the whole world is in my hands now
but nothing will last
oh bring back the harmony

What will you do in the dark
the hand of your fate left it's mark
so don't try to argue with me now

Your Hell ain't a bad place to be
take a look at your life now and see
'cause maybe I will not come back

You stand on the edge of the world
your life will be torn into pieces
The hammer is falling
the world is not waiting for you
hey you think that you know what is real
travelling around for no reason
you better watch out and jump off of my cloud
for your own sake

Set me free, yeah I wanna live it up
and let me be what I wanna be

Set me free, mmh I wanna live it up
and let me be all I wanna be
cause the whole world is in my hands now
and I want it to last
oh

Set me free, yeah
and let me be what I wanna be
the whole world is in my hands now
and I want it to last

Opportunity is me
