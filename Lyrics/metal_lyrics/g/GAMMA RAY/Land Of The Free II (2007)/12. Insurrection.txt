I look out to the stormy sea
I wish upon a star
Pulsating light to comfort me
But oh, it seems so far

So as I stand I realize
I wish that I'll be there
About to give up all my life
and vanish in thin air

But I know, as I dream
all the world has passed me by
and I know I should do better
for you and me tonight

I'm coming home, Yeah!

There were stars in the eyes at the masquerade
and the King was lost in the grand illusion
Well, the the day has come , they've lost the way
and the Joker laughs at the mass confusion
They stand and stare

Now listen all you people
This is what I say
Raise my voice in anger
I'm trying to get away
....... from all

Now listen, what you're doing
is just not good at all
the silly games you're playing
are raising up the wall

Time goes by, the world we love
is gone.....forever

Are we ever gonna change our way
Will we ever stop the fury
Is it life or will we just decay
Will we lose or stand in glory

Insurrection-God election
Heavy changes make my day
Storm the spire, Hearts on fire
Storm is coming on its way

Insurrection, Insurrection

Masses will be rising, marching forces neutralising
all the powers in the world with raging fury
Enemies are falling down, their blood is spilled on holy ground
the end is near for maximizing profits

Why do we have to fight, why?
Close your eyes and die

Are we ever gonna change our way
Will we ever stop the fury
Is it life or will we just decay
Will we lose or stand in glory

Insurrection-God election
Heavy changes, disobey
Storm the spire, hearts on fire
Storm is coming on its way

Insurrection

The king of damnation learned from the old
The harvest of fury
Love is the answer, blood is the oath
Red are the canyons, oh

Friend or foe, we have been trying
Kings and Queens, all have been lying
All the same, all devastating
All I see when contemplating hope

Here I stand alone, and I have lost the way
The eyes of a believer, turning to stone
Silent, no more tears, the emptiness is mine
Only Rain is falling, dripping on the trail
Father of the earth, I'm calling you
Dry your tears away and give me hope
Fill my heart with strength
And give power to my soul
Let magic fill the sky and take me home
singing....
ooh, let me go!

Are we ever gonna change our way
Will we ever stop the fury
Is it life or will we just decay
We must fight to stand in glory

Insurrection-God election
Heavy changes, disobey
Storm the spire, hearts on fire
Storm is coming on its way

I look out to the stormy sea
I wish upon a star....
