You try to force me on my knees
Until you reach the point of no return

You can't change me, 'cause I am free
Let me out now, I've got some fuel here to burn

In the land of the free, they're calling out for me
I'm riding on the wind, I'm on my way

Into the storm, Into the storm

Now I am riding on forever
and I don't know where I will go
And every storm I'm running after
will take me further on I know

A land of the free is calling out for me
I'm riding on the wind, I'm on my way

Into the storm, Into the storm
Get out of my way!

A land of the free, made for you and me
We're riding on together on our way

Into the storm, into the storm
I'm riding on into the storm
