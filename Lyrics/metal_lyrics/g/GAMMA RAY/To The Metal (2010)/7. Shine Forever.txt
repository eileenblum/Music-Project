[SchlÃ¤chter]

Give me peace and absolution
Take me up into the light
Sacrifice and self-destruction
Bodies burning bright
To die for revelation
Decimate the enemy
Holy war into damnation
Blood is on the streets

But when the knife is cutting deep
And you're crying in your sleep
Then it's time to come alive

And rise up, shine forever
You will see the light again on your road

Watch your step they're right behind you
Better move without a sound
Damn the day they're gonna find you
Grind you to the ground

And the knife is cutting deep
And in agony you creep
And it's time to come alive

And rise up, shine forever
You will see the light on your road
Rise up it's now or never
You will see the light again on your road

Standing and watching the fire
Don't wanna stand in the row
Watching the flames getting higher
Look at yourself, regain your self-control

Take a look around you, you're not alone
So stand up and rise

Rise up, shine forever
You will see the light on your road
Rise up shine forever
And your star will rise again
It will rise
