[Hansen]

Coming from the streets
fists up in the air
generating heat
they come from everywhere

Hail

Fists are made of iron
bodies made of steel
dancing on a razor
Metal is the deal
Hail

[Chorus:]
We came to feel the thunder
the lightning and the heat
we came to hail the metal gods
banging to the beat
singin

Hail to the Metal, hail
Singin  Hail Heavy Metal, hail

The power in the music
arising in us all
we re never gonna lose it
we re proud and standing tall
Hail
I said hail

If you just cannot feel it
you ll never understand
there s nothing s gonna beat it
Metal rules the land
Hail

We came to feel the thunder
the lightning and the heat
we came to hail the metal gods
banging to the beat
singin

Hail to the Metal, hail
Singin  Hail Heavy Metal, hail
Hail

Hail Heavy Metal, hail
Hail Heavy Metal, hail
Hail Heavy Metal, hail

Hail to the Metal
Heavy Metal
Hail
Hail to the Metal
Heavy Metal
All Hail
Hail to the Metal
Heavy Metal
All Hail
Hail to the Metal
Heavy Metal
All Hail
Hail to the Metal
Heavy Metal
All Hail
