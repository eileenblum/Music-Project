[Zimmermann]

Fast decline of human values
Fast decay of virtues and morality
We're falling to pieces

Trust and faith are smashed to splinters
Confidence abused and torn away
But we will remember

We know who's the one to blame
We hold out 'till the end of the game

[Chorus:]
And then we'll rise in victory
We'll return stronger than ever
We shall rise from agony
Stand our ground
Stronger than ever

Self-destructive human nature
We sell out the future of our kind
We're going from heaven to hell
We walk through storm and fire
Now we have to stand the test of time
But we won't surrender
We face the demons of our crime
A chance for us, a chance for all mankind

And then we'll rise in victory
We'll return stronger than ever
We shall rise from agony
Stand our ground
Stronger than ever

Hate creates destruction
Greed wants to posses
Virus, massinfection
Force wants to oppress
Who's the core of evil
Who directs our fall
Who creates the chaos
Who's responsible

And then we'll rise in victory
We'll return stronger than ever
We shall rise from agony
Stand our ground
Stronger than ever
