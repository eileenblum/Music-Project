[bonus track]I'm the biggest I'm the best
And I'm better than the rest
I'm so tough and I'm so cool
And I'll put you on the test
I am the man I have the clue
I'm the big cheese here
Now who the fuck are you

Your show is bad your style is fake
But the biggest fake will make the day
And take the cake
Did you ever realize you're big time suckin'
You think you're really awesome
But you're close to nothing

You pretend to be a friend
Don't try that one on me
So fuck off stay away from me
And leave me be

Save me now help me out
Save me from the wannabees
Help me out save me now
Save me from the wannabees

VIPs and other maggots
Smalltalk rules by stupid braggarts
Bla bla bla bla bla bla you don't stop talkin'
A flow of words but they don't mean nothin'

You pretend to be a friend
Though we never met before
So what the hell is wrong with you
Don't bother me no more

Save me now help me out
Save me from the wannabees
Help me out save me now
Save me from the wannabees

Who gave you a backstage pass
It was a fucker from All Access
Remove yourself out of this place
Or we're gonna kick your face whoo

Save me now help me out
Save me from the wannabees
Help me out save me now
Save me from the wannabees
Save me now help me out
Save me from the wannabees
Help me out save me now
Save me from the wannabees
