[Hansen]

As the days grow colder now
And everything is lost
A vision forms of better men
Rising from the cross

Never held the key to life
Finally their loss
Rising from the emptiness
And all that ever was

The battle rages on 'til now
Many men were lost
Dried into an empty shell
Nailed onto the cross

As I lie awake by now
Having never loved
Heaven sent for all of us
So painful our loss

In the eyes of the world a believer
But I'm sure they'll be turning away

[Chorus:]
Takes me down to a place below
Can't you see I'm falling
Pain has come
And the world will surely hide
In empathy

And then the world's religious fools
Come knocking at your door
Mankind is not wiser now
I've heard it all before

Still the mindless will hail the deceivers
And I'm sure they'll be turning away

Takes me down to a place below
Can't you see I'm falling
Pain has come
And the world will surely hide

In empathy

Empathy
In empathy
And the world will hide
In empathy
In empathy
Yes the world will hide
In empathy
The world will hide
Empathy
Empathy!
