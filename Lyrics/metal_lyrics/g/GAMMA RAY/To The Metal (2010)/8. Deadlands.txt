[Hansen]

Coming from the dark side
When the moon enlights the still
They're chasing you around
And they aim in for the kill
Seven deadly snipers, seven lives to live
Seven million pairs of eyes
Are watching for the thrill

The eyes of the hangmen
Will dance in your head
The silence is broken
The beast going mad

[Chorus:]
Now you run from the deadlands
The eyes of a stranger will follow
Run like a madman
The eyes of the stranger will follow
Now run!

I will not die in vain
I will not live in pain
And seven deadly bullets
Have not found me
I won't bow to you all
You'll never see me crawl
And seven deadly snipers won't
Surround me nevermore

The eyes of the hangmen
To pieces are torn
The dawn of a new world
A king to be born

Now you run from the deadlands
The eyes of a stranger will follow
Run like a madman
The eyes of the stranger will follow
Now run!

I'm on the run
From the shadows
From the deadlands
Oh yea
