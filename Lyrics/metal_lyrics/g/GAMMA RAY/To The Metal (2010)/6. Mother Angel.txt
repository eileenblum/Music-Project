[Hansen]

From the book of life
Comes a rider for the damned
And he wields the scythe
As he rides across the land

But when he comes
You'll never know
Then it's time for you to leave the world

[Chorus:]
Mother Angel tell me why
Is it cool up in the sky
Was it time for you to disappear and go
Is there something I should know
Was it time for you to go
Waiting for a sign from you
To let me know
Here on my own

From the ashes we do come
To the ashes we shall go
And the dust that we were made of
Shall embrace our very soul
All the times that we don't know
Make it harder to believe in god
And heaven above

So Mother Angel tell me why
Is it cool up in the sky
Was it time for you to disappear and go
Is there something I should know
Was it time for you to go
Waiting for a sign from you
To let me know
Here on my own

My hands reach out into thin air
And the truth is hard to bear
No one comes to bring you back again

So Mother Angel tell me why
Is it cool up in the sky
Was it time for you to disappear and go
Is there something I should know
Was it time for you to go
Waiting for a sign from you
To let me know
Here on my own
