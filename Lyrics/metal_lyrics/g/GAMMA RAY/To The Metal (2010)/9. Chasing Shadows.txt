[Richter]

Catch the wind
I'm gonna fly away
No turning back
Forever starts today

I am searching for something
Something I've never found
I am bleeding
Still proceeding
Want you to be around

[Chorus:]
Queen of the light
Star shining bright
Blessed by the light of the moon
A chase with the wind to the gardens of sin
Take me away, I am coming

Chasing shadows

Turn the page
Don't waste your life away
The choice is yours
Don't waste another day

Are you looking for someone
Someone deep in your mind
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?
Is it you I will find

Queen of the light
Star shining bright
Blessed by the light of the moon
A chase with the wind to the gardens of sin
Take me away, I am coming

Chasing shadows

Give me your light
To bring sun to the night
Make me whole again
Back in the sun
I am chasing the shadows away

Save me from the tears and rain
A taste of freedom from the pain
The choice to be the man I was before
And when the end of day is near
I'll never know if she apperas
Will you open the door

Queen of the light
Star shining bright
Blessed by the light of the moon
A chase with the wind to the gardens of sin
Take me away, I am coming

Chasing shadows

Give me your light
To bring sun to the night
Make me whole again
Back in the sun
I am chasing the shadows away

Chasing shadows
