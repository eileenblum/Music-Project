[Richter]

A lonely rider in the morning sun
Heading out into the west
And his journey only has begun
He still believes the very best

A golden rainbow hanging in the sky
Full of mercy for those about to die
Up in the heavens so close to the edge
An angel shall speak to the dead

[Chorus:]
Time to live
I hear the voices
Time to live
Of the spirits in the sky
Time to live
They leave no choices
Time to live now, live
Live or die

The fading light beams of the setting sun
Showing life is but a wheel
Oh lord, I never wanted to be the one
To be dying on the fields

And when it's over and all is set and done
No more crying no more loving on the run
Up in the heavens so close to the edge
An angel shall speak to the dead

Time to live
I hear the voices
Time to live
Of the spirits in the sky
Time to live
They leave no choices
Time to live now, live
Live or die

Don't you wonder, ride again
When you always hide in shadows
You will never lose the pain
When the sky shines in amber
And night starts to fall
There's a light that burns forever for us all

Time to live
Time to live
Time to live
I hear the voices
Time to live
Of the spirits in the sky
Time to live
They leave no choices
Time to live now, live
Live or die
