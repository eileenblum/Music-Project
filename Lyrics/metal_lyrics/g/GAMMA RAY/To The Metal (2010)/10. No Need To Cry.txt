[SchlÃ¤chter]

I remember the times we had
Take a look at the past
I can see you clearly now, very well
But I don't know when you lost yourself
There was no way to find you
You were deep, so deep
Inside your world

Don't know where to go
Uh and I miss you so
I lost you and I'll never be the same
Now you're gone
And I learned to be strong
And there's

No need to cry and there's
No need to die
'cause all we need is love, there is
No need to cry and there's
No need to die
'cause the world keeps turning on

So much I've said
but I guess I was right after all
You have never, never really been alone
And on your way
There's been trouble and pain
And everything that comes along with it
We had seen it all before

No need to cry and there's
No need to die
'cause all we need is love, there is
No need to cry and there's
No need to die
'cause the world keeps turning on

What have you done with all your life
What have you done with all of your love
Who cares about it when you're gone
I don't know and you'll never see

What's the sense of it
What's the sense of all
What's the sense of our life
There's one hundred million ways
To go and
We will never know
What's our truth or reality

What have you done with all your love
And what have you done with all of your life
There's nothing left to stay right now and
I don't know and you'll never know

No need to cry and there's
No need to die
'cause all we can give is
Hope, truth (faith) and love
There's
No need to cry and there's
No need to die
Oh, the world keeps turning on

There is a light on the dark
A light in the dark for everyone
For everyone
