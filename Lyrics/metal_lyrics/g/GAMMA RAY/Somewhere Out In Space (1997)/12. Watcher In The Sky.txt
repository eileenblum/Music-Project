[ Music &amp; Lyrics: Sieck / Hansen ]

I'm watching the mountains I'm watching the sea
Observing the creatures I am lost - set me free
Across the heavens I made my way
I've seen empires rise and blown away

I have arrived at my destiny but after all there's just emptiness in me
Dot in the darkness - I am going mad
Where are the others - there's silence in my head

'Cause I'm watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky

I'm trapped in this nightmare
Endless tortures and pain, milleniums have gone by
Uhhh, it drives me insane

Who am I now ?
I'm not man - I'm not machine
I gave my life away for the Iron Savior dream

'Cause I'm watcher in the sky ...

[ Solo: Kai ]

[ Piet: ]
Hooked to the circuits of a lifeless, cold machine
Lost in a world of artificial means
Ripped out of my body
I'll stand the rest of time
Am I perpetual ? - am I devine ?

[ Solo: Piet / Kai ]

I'm a watcher in the sky
My soul has drowned in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the chosen one but I am lost in time
I'm a watcher in the sky I've seen the years go by
I am the chosen one
Out in the cold my systems overload and I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky
Watching the mountains, watching the sea, watching the creatures
You'll never be free
Watcher in the sky
