[bonus track]

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Hensley / Byron]

Searching every day, looking every way
Trying to make a connection, to find a piece of the action
Like a hungry poet, who doesn't know
He is close to perfection, choice is the question

Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side by side they will see us ride
VBut if they cared to look, than they would see
It's our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy

Can you understand, that in every man
There's a need to unwind, that's never been defind
Somewhere deep within, there's another bveing
You are somehow avbusing, by the person you're using

Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side vby side they will see us ride
But if they cvared to look, than they would see
It's our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy

Travvelling faster than lightning
Closer than ever before
We can go on for you, and take you nearer to
The legend of mystery from the beginning of time
Dreaming... TIME... Dreaming
We can return to the land of the good and the kind
TIME... Dreaming... TIME... Dreaming
Why don't you come to our party and open your minds

In another place, there's a newer face
Like an unfinished painting, your creator is waiting
The brush and pen describe, what it is inside
That will set your mind thinking, while the others are sinking

Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side by, side they will se us ride
But if they cared to look, than they would see
It's just our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, oh yeah
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy
