[ Music: Schlachter, Lyrics: Hansen ]

Atomic fallout scans the sky
Another placve where people die
And with the massive final punch
We left a wound of pain

And now pollutions everywhere
Another death is in the air
A million people left alone
Down in their desperate, blackened homes

Tomorrow there'll be no sun
Hanging up in the sky
Tomorrow all dead and gone
And I wish I could fly

We are lost, in the future, we are lost
In a dream we can't control
No way

So tell me now computer god
Is there a way to leave the quod
On this merciless ride
When someone faces he will die

We plug our lives into machines
And as they're guiding our dreams
We're individually lost
As we are nailed to our cross

Tomorrow there'll be a sun
Hanging up in the sky
Tomorrow I'm dead and gone
Oh I wish that I could fly

We are lost, in the future, we are lost
It's a nightmare, we are lost
In the future, we are lost
In a dream we'll never see

[ Solo: Both / Henjo / Kai / Both ]

All hope is lost, but nothing gained
We're crying again
Is this the end ?

Lost, in the future, we are lost
It's a nightmare, we are lost
In the future, we are lost
In a dream we can't control

We're lost, so lost
We're lost, so lost
We all are lost !

[DOES OUR HIGHSPEED, HIGHTECH DEVELOPMENT REALLY MAKE THINGS BETTER OR EASIER OR ARE WE JUST FORCED TO RUN AND STRUGGLE EVEN MORE ?]
