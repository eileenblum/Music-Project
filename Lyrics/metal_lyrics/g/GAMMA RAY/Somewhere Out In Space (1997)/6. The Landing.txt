[ Music: Schlachter, Lyrics: Hansen]

High in the machines
Above the earth
We observe your lifeform
We've come for you

Riding the machines
We'll take your souls
Riding the machines
We've come to rule

About 400 000 years ago
When evolution was still on the make
An extraterrestial race
Appeared in our part of the galaxy
Heading straight to the earth

Riding the machines
We'll take your souls
Riding the machines
We've come for you

When they finally landed
They found a planet with perfect survival conditions
A lower lifeform called humans
Considered them as gods
From somewhere out of space

[A WAR OF THE WORLDS LIKE ACCOUSTIC PICTURE OF AN ALIEN FLEET ABOVE THE EARTH. NO GUITARS ON THIS ONE, ONLY BASSES.]
