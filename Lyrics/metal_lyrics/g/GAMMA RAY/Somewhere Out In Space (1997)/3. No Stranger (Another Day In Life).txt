[ Music &amp; Lyrics: Hansen ]

I see a hole in the sky
But don't ask me for why I'm so down and lonely
No one will understand why
There's a voice in my head
And I know It's the only

I see the children play, with fire in their eyes
And when the day begins
... another day in life

I'm standing tall, 'cause I won't fall
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself
I see horizons in my sky
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself

Days will full of joy
Are drivin' down to the pain
Into the sun, a mothers son
It's just about to fly

I see the morning come, with fire in my eyes
And when the day begins
... another day in life

I'm standing tall 'cause I won't fall
I'm no stranger to myself
I see horizons in my sky
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself

[ Solos: Kai / Both ]

I see the morning come, with fire in the sky
And now the day begins
... another day in life

I'm standing tall, 'cause I won't fall
I'm no stranger to myself
I see horizons in my sky
'Cause I'm no stranger to myself
No, no I'm no stranger to myself

[ABOUS STRENGHT YOU CAN GET WHEN YOU KNOW YOURSELF, AND THEY TRY TO PUT YOUR POWER INTO THE GOOD THINGS EVERY DAY.]
