[ Music &amp; Lyrics: Henjo Richter ]

In a land, far beyond the sun
Rules the darkness, faceless magician
Black towers which raise into the sky
Castle of tears, shadows passing by

Blood is covering the mighty walls
Of those who lost their skin and bones
No one ever saw the light
Oh, slaves of the night

There's a young man, chained on a stake
Liveless body, he has no strenght to break
His shirt is bloody, his head is hanging down
He's mean to die, the ruler took his crown

The wind howles through the emtiness
A different sound as in the past
Screameng echoes in the lanes
Oh, victims of the pain

The clouds passing by, a hole breaks the sky
Light refract the dark and fills the place
White winged horse, such a powerfull force
Gallops through the sky to break the chains

The winged horse lands by the one
It snorts and stamps, the escape has just begun
The chains are broken, silence fills the place
He backs the horse with his last ounce of strenght

The white horse rears and spreads its wings
To reach the sky and search the kings
The one will lead to win at last
Oh, rulers of the past

The clouds passing by, a hole breaks the sky
Light refract the dark and fills the place
The white winged horse like a powerfull force
Gallops through the sky to free the land

The white horse rears and spreads...

[ Solo: Henjo / Kai / Henjo / Both / Henjo

The kings return, armed with mighty swords
To retake the land and banish evil thoughts
They fight againist the shadows, captured souls of the dark might
Dethrone, the evil ruler to bring the sun to the night.

The battle takes heavy toll
But they achieve what they're fighting for
Now the land is free again
Oh, no more blood and pain

The clouds passing by, a hole breaks the sky
Light refract the dark and fills the place
White winged horse, such a powerful force
Gallops through the sky to free the land

But still at night when darkness rules again
Whispering shadows creeping through the lanes
Evil creatures of the expelled magician
Oh, it's a fight you'll never win

[A TALE IN THE CIRCLE OF OPPRESSION AND RESISTANCE THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN IF YOU FORCE FREEDOM.]
