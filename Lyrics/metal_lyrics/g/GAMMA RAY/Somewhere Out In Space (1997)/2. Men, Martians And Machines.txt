[ Music &amp; Lyrics: Hansen ]

From out of space we came on to the earth
From far away on solar beams
A dying race to find survival here
For our kind to plant our seeds

Our analysis of the atmosphere
Was good and so we touched the ground
A rising simple structured life form there
Seemed to be perfect what we'd found

We think in anger of our fallin dream
Our home is now a fading light
The cracks appeared and they where pointing at the end
And so we came to save our lives

Men, Martians and Machines

You were too young to understand our plans
To see the things up in the sky
We were the gods and we have tought you well
And so we fond eternal life

We gained control upon our destiny
Our ships were flying everywhere
The cracks appeared our plan was bound to fall again
And now the circle's closing in

Men, Martians and Machines

[ Solos: Both / Kai ]

We can't control our human sacrifice
Again we fear for our lives
The cracks appeared our brains start to distort again
Now we gonna say goodbye

Men, Martians and Machines

[SO, IF "MARTIANS" HAD BVEEN COMMING TO THE EARTH IN MIGHTY MACHINES, BECAUSE THEIR PLANET WAS WASTED, MAYBE WE WILL BE THE NEXT MARSIANS, ONE DAY CONQERING ANOTHER PLANET. IT MIGHT BE A TURNING CIRCLE.]
