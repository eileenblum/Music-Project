[Music &amp; Lyrics: Hansen]

Father can you hear me, did you talk to mother earth
What did they say, what did they see, now ... is time for your rebirth ?

Open up the silent center of your mind,
I now want to know the future of your kind

In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods return to fight, for the future in their lives
In the valley of the kings

Oh mother do you hear me, did you talk to father moon
I don't want to leave my brothers in this temple of their doom

Open up the silent center of your mind,
I now want to know the future of your kind

In the valley of the kings, when the storms break loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings, in the valley of the kings

Ra vvite, deus sanktus, ra vite
Ra vite, revertate, ra vite

[ Solos: Kai / Both / Kai / Henjo ]

Oh mother earth do you believe there is a place for us to go
Come set us free again and let us fly away and give us hope

There'll be a time for us to fly to our thrones up in the sky

In the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings, in the valley of the kings

[ABOUT THE THOUGHT, THAT ANCIENT GODS WERE VISITORS FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE GALAXY, PUTTING THEIR CHILDREN INTO SOME KIND OF DEEP FREEZE SLEEP, AFTER IMPLANTING THE BASIS FOR OUR HUMAN INTELLIGENCE INTO OUR EARLY ANCESTORS. ONE OF THEM AWAKENING IN THESE DAYS, BEING USED TO BE SEEN AS A GOD, TRYING TO GET INFORMATION FROM HIS PARENTS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT WILL COME UP NEXT, EXPRESSING THE WILL TO RETURN TO THE OLD STATUS.]
