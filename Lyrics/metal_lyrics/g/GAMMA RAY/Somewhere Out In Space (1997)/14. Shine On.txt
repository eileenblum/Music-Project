[Music: Schlachter, Lyrics: Hansen]

We drive, we drive, we're riding on through the universe
We've come to reach our destination planet earth
We come, we run, oyu cannot see us, flying in our spaceships, shooting cross the sky
We explore and we all know what this is about for us all

So many light years we have travelled far from home
Someday we'll be there I know

Shine on rising star
We travelled such a long way
But still you seem so far
Shine on, Rising star for our belief in unity at heart
Rising Star
Come on and shine

Living was torture and dying release
A declining world, no future, no hope
We were passing the point of no return

So many light years, still we travel on and on
And someday we will call you home

Shine on, Rising Star
Diamond in the distance, still you seem so far
Shine on, Rising Star
Forever light the darkness in our hearts
Rising Star, Rising Star

Salvation,
Damnation
We crawl across the sky with pain
Forever we will fly

Out in the darkness
There's a never ending light

[ Solo: Both ]

Still we are far away
But we'll be there one day
Someday we will call you home

Shine on, Rising Star
We travelled such a long way but still you seem so far
Shine on, Rising Star
Forever light the darkness in our hearts
Rising Star, Rising Star

Shadows in the darkness, so far away from home
Standing all alone, noone there beside me
Shadows all around, so far away from home
I know I'm not alone, It seems we're lost in space and time
Shine on
Shine on now, and warm the tears we've shed through years
It's our prison, final reason for the freedom and the glory that we feel
Are you for real ?

Shine on, Rising Star
Diamond in the distance
Still you seem so far
Shine on, Rising Star
Forever light the darkness in our hearts
Rising Star, Rising Star
Shine on, Rising Star
Come on and shine for us
Shine on, shine forever more
Shine on,
Our survival
Rising Star, the last chance for us all
The only hope for our future and  a home
For us all
For us all
Come on and shine, Rising Star

[ALL HOPES FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE RACE ARE PUT INTO A VOYAGE TO A DISTANT PLANET THEY CALLED EARTH, THAT HAS JUST BEEN BORN. THE VOYAGE WILL LAST THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS, SO WHEN FINALLY THEY WILL ARRIVE, EARTH WILL PROVIDE PERFECT CONDITIONS.]
