[Iron Savior version]
[Music and Lyrics by Sielck / Hansen]

I'm watching the mountains I'm watching the sea
observing the creatures I am lost - set me free
across the heavens I made my way
I've seen empires rise and blown away
I have arrived at my destiny but after all there's just emptiness in me

out in the darkness - I am going mad
where are the others - there's silence in my head

'cause I'm a watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
out in the cold my systems overload
I am lost in time
watcher in the sky

I'm trapped in this nightmare
endless tortures and pain, milleniums have gone by
uhhh, it drives me insane!

who am I now?
I'm not man - I'm not machine
I gave my life away for the Iron Savior dream

'cause I'm a watcher in the sky ...

[Solo Kai]

[Piet]
hooked to the circuits of a lifeless, cold machine
lost in a world of artifcial means
ripped out of my body
I'll stand the test of time
am I perpetual? - am I devine?

[Solo Piet / Solo Kai]

I'm a watcher in the sky
my soul has drowned in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the chosen one but I am lost in time
I'm a watcher in the sky I've seen the years go by
I am the chosen one
out in the cold my systems overload and I am lost in time
watcher in the sky
watching the mountains, watching the sea, watching the creatures
You'll never be free
Watcher in the sky
