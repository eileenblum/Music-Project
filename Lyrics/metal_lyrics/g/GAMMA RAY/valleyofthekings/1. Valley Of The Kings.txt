[music &amp; lyrics by Kai Hansen]

Father can you hear me, did you talk to mother earth
what did she say, what did you see, now ...is it time for our rebirth?

open up the silent center of your mind,
I now want to know the future of our kind

in the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
then the gods return to fight, for the future of their lives
in the valley of the kings

oh mother do you hear me, did you talk to father moon
I don't want to leave my brothers in this temple of their doom

open up the silent center of your mind
I now want to know the future of our kind

in the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
then the gods will spread their wings, In the valley of the kings

ra vite, deus sanktus, ra vite
ra vite, revertate, ra vite

[Solo (... for those who care )]
[Kai, Both, Kai, Henjo]

oh mother earth do you believe there is a place for us to go
come set us free again and let us fly away and give us hope

there'll be a time for us to fly to our thrones up in the sky

in the valley of the kings, when the storm breaks loose again
then the gods will spread their wings, In the valley of the kings
