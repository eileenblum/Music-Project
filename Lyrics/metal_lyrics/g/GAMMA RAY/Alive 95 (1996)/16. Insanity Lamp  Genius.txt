Therefore I'm laying down in laughter
mighty, the mightiest life here after
the trip we started has not finished here
while we think there's not a shade of fear

Black points jump in  crossing lines
Insanity and Genius
both two sides are what I find and I know over mine.

Sometimes my womb bears an acteur,
your mind creating tragic factors
you've got knowledge stolen from the sea
you've got wisdom - just stolen knowledge

Black points jump in  crossing lines
both two sides are what I find
Insanity not far behind the genius inside

And everyday a dreamer dies
to see what's on the other side
And everyday more dreamers die my friend
while black points jump crossing lines again
