Now I must go, I'll wait for you to follow. No turning back.
But there's a light, I've seen it all, riding through, never fall.
When all is done, we must be one. I will return ......
The saviour is calling, he's riding through the night.
The only, the holy, returning from the light.
We fall to the ground and we pray, `cause he's the one.
No demons left in this world since he has won. ....Oh, hear what I say
.....

All men come, to see the king of the world.
The time has come for everyone, the saviour stands for all of us,
now praise the one who'll destroy, the evil abyss of the void.

His armour, still shining, though it's torn from fights.
The brave man, redeemer, he brought us back to life. ....(Oh, yes he did.)

Now fall to the ground and pray, cause he will come.
No demons left in this world, since he has won. ....Now, listen to what I say.....

All men come, to see land of the free.
The time has come for everyone, the saviour stands for all of us.
Now praise the one who'll destroy, the evil abyss of the void.

His armour, still shining, though it's torn by fights.
The brave man, he battled, on through the night.
His eyes, they were gleaming like fire and he's prepared, he's the one.
The young man, he raises his head up to the land in the sun.
Wherever my spirit may fly, up to this heavenly fight,
I know that I will return from a mission beyond our skies. .....Now..
