[Holocaust Cover]

Inside the power cage,
I can feel the music of my age
It`s paranoid first degree,
It`s telling me that I`m not free
I`ve got Heavy Metal Music in my blood,
And I`d like to get it to you if I could.
As I lie here in the fright of darkness,
the wings of light remove the veil
It`s Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Heavy,
Heavy Metal Mania all the way.
Rock and Roll was far too slow,
and so the adrenaline just doesn`t flow
Where is the power, where is the glory,
Heavy Metal is my story.
We`ve got Heavy Metal Music in our blood,
And we`d like to get it to you if we could.
