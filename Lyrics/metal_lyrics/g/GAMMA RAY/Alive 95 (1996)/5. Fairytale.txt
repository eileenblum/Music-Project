Now my friend it's time for you to break the spell

Your heart was torn in two and somebody revealed the wall ......

Now we stand together, our fight is to be free
we never will surrender, we ride across the fields

Now it's time to break the silence
and the truth shall be revealed
take the question mark from your head...
let the fairytale be real
let the fairytale be real!
