You know who I am, I show you a land
Where you can be free, can get your relief.
Space is all yours, desires come true,
Love of your life waitin' for you

I got no time for wasting all my day,
come on and follow, follow me away
Spaceeater - you're losing control
Spaceeater - and I own your soul

I'll make you happy, ain't no lie,
come eat ma space, you're gonna fly.
Let me control your senses,
And lose your mind, your worries inside.

I got no time to stand and waste my day,
Come on and follow me, follow me away.
Spaceeater - you're losing control
Spaceeater - and I own your soul

A little bit, a little bit, a little sip, a little hit
You're drowning in a lusty whirl, be
Superman or Wondergirl
Oh, we fly away on supersonic dreams, we
ride on universal starshine,
through space.

I got no time to stand and waste my day,
Come on and follow, follow me away.
Spaceeater -
