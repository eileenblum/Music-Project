In the morning you try to recover
But you still got the red in your eyes
Then you get up and look in the mirror
And you see the beast arise
Got a big red nose from the overdose
And somebody else's eyes
And you think to thee is it really me
And you have to realize
The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high cause you're still doing it
Don't you know that we all stand in line
Our future dreams are just a waste of time
Our future - is a madhouse and we all are movin' in
Our world - needs some action cause there's nothing left to gain
Take your baggy things are ready
You only need to come
Join this century's schizoid clan
The rooms are primed and done
The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high cause it perfectly fits
Don't you think that you are wasting time
Insanity is just a state of mind
Our future - is a madhouse...

[Solo Kai/Dirk/Kai]

Our world - is a madhouse, in the gutter, come on in
Our world - needs some action, satisfaction till the end
Our world - we need sex and crime to supply our minds
An amazing time, come on in
Our world - and we party on till our life is done
Just to waste on time - till the end
