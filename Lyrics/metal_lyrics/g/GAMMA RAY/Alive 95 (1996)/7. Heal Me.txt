When I wake up at the end of the day
moon comes out sun fades away
I get myself out of my bed and cry
is it really me now, could this be the real thing
is there someone else to ease the pain.
So easy, so easy now, has it really gone too far?
It doesn't matter anyhow. Sometimes I feel like
an echo in the wind that's not coming back again.

I look inside my head and what I see
are the reflections of the world
and I see Genius and Insanity.

You are alive you're part of the show
you come to foresee the signs on the wall
so many tried in vain they know the truth
learn how to live and fight and learn how to
fight them right and learn how to give and take it all.

You can be strong if you know who you are
the signs on the wall tell you move on before
it's too late.

Can you read them could you be the one
who`s creeping on the floor. The chaos
is a killer and he knows who will fall
help me, I need some help
now is there someone out there
what are you waiting for, you're on the
road to nowhere, the only way I know
maybe I'm wrong I haven't got a clue
don't know where I belong, tell me what is true.

Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me

Think, don't think, what can you see
our life is just a fantasy of someone we will
never see, therefore I break down in laughter
how as I change my point of view there's
nothing left to make me blue, never again, no more

Come on my friend and join the ball
everything is beautiful, even the band
it's magic. Imagine you're a superstar
you gonna fly you gonna go far, so far.

Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
Oh won't you come to heal me, hear me
