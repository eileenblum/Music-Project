As the heat is rising, out there in the past
Fallen angels calling, they have come to last
They are coming out of the dark
Then the horsemen ride out,
everything grows cold
Now their armies march in,
out there from the underworld
I do not want my eyes to see,
I never wanted to believe
Take me to the gardens of the sinner,
Bury me and let me rest in peace
Now the time of truth has come for everyone
The fallen angel stands in victory
The final seal was broken,
it opened up the gates
For the dark avengers,
their anger kills the light and then ...
I do not want my eyes to see,
I never wanted to believe

Take me to the gardens of the sinner,
Bury me and let me rest in peace
Now the time of truth has come for everyone
The fallen angel stands in victory
As the seventh angel opened up the seal
His curse brought endless desease
And as the wind carried the deadly seed
to the minds of the doomed,
They were gone for the stage of hell
Take me to the gardens of the sinner,
Take me down and let me rest in peace
Now the time of truth has come for everyone
The fallen angel laughs and grins, now...
Take me to the gardens of the sinner,
Bury me and let me rest in peace
Celebrate the time of truth for everyone
The fallen angel stands in victory ...
