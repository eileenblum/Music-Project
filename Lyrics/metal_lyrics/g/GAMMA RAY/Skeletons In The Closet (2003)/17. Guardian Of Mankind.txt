For no one to see for no one to hear
They fight for our souls without any fear
When injustice done they open their gates
To maintain balance between good and bad

And the winds of freedom blow they vanish into haze
The mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hate

The guardians of Mankind
Are losin' their faith
'Cause malice and falseness
Spread over the human race
The guardians of mankind
Won't shelter our souls
The rulers of darkness
Will soon gain control

Don't try to deceive them don't try to play false
'Cause losing their favour will be the end of shelter

And as the winds of freedom blow they vanish into haze
The mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hate

The guardians of Mankind

[ Solo Henjo, Both, Henjo ]

And as the winds of freedom blow they vanish into haze
The mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hate

The guardians of Mankind
Are losin' their faith
'Cause malice and falseness
Spread over the human race
If guardians of mankind
Won't shelter our souls
The rulers of darkness
Will soon gain control
