The sun goes down in the western sky
The shadows are gonna return,
I wander alone through the back of my mind,
The twilight of moonstarts to burn

How I can see beyond existence?
I'm leaving into the unknown
I wander around as I hear someone scream,
A voice that is never my own

Oh, how can you dare to dwell
All alone in the back of your head
As we struggle for life in this emotional
We wait for the gods to be there

Gods of deliverance, how can I set free
Souls in the underworld
Calling out for me...They're in my head

Wherever you'll roam in your dreams,
You'll have to remember your name
So many are trapped - down in the abyss
They're waiting for you and they say

How can you dare to stand all alone
On this side of the wall.
As we struggle for life in this emotional
We wait for salvation to call.

Gods of deliverance, how can I set free
Souls in the underworld
Calling out for me...They're in my head
They're in my head

[SOLO: Dirk/both/Dirk]

Morning comes around again,
Shadows are leaving the night
Now there's a sense for existence,
I've seen it with my own two eyes
The vision is now getting clearer,
Now that I've seen the unknown
The voices I yearning to live again,
The gods will be guiding us home

And you still dare to dwell all alone
In the back of your head
Still we struggle for life
In this emotional hell,
Salvation will one day be there

Don't you be misled,
By the illusions in your head
Then the gods of deliverance will say
'No more illusions, we're leavin' today

Don't you be misled,
By the illusions in your head
Then the gods of deliverance will say
'No more illusions, we're leavin' today
We're in your head - They're in my head
We're in your head - In my head...
