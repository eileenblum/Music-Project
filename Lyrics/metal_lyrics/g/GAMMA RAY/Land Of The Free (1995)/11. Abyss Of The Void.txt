Now I must go, I'll wait for you to follow
No turning back
But there's a light, I've seen it all,
Riding through, never fall.
When all is done, we must be one
I will return...

The saviour is calling,
He's riding through the night.
The only, the holy,
Returning from the light.
We fall to the ground and we pray,
'Cause he's the one.
No demons left in this world
Since he has won
Oh, hear what I say...

All men come,
To see the king of the world
The time has come for everyone,
The saviour stands for all of us,
Now praise the one who'll destroy,
The evil abyss of the void

His armour, still shining,
Though it's torn by fights
The brave man, redeemer,
He brought us back to life
(Oh, yeas he did)

Now fall to the ground and pray,
Cause he will come
No demons left in this world,
Since he has won
Now, listen to what I say...

All men come, to see the land of the free
The time has come for everyone,
The saviour stands for all of us,
Now praise the one who'll destroy,
The evil abyss of the void
The evil abyss of the void

His armour, still shining,
Though it's torn by fights
The brave man, he battled,
On through the night
His eyes, they were gleaning like fire
And he's prepared, he's the one
The young man,
He raises his head up
To the land in the sun
Wherever my spirit may fly,
Up to this heavenly fight,
I know,
That I will return from a mission
Beyond our skies - Now

[SOLO: Dirk/Kai]

We fall to the ground and we pray,
'Cause he's the one.
No demons left in this world
Since he has won
Oh, hear what I say...

All men come,
To see the king of the world
The time has come for everyone,
The saviour stands for all of us,
Now praise the one who'll destroy,
The evil abyss of the void
The evil abyss of the void
The evil abyss of the void
