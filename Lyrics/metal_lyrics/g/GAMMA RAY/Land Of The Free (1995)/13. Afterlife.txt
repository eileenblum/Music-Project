Do you believe in the aftreworld
Or the afterlife?
Do you agree there's a place for us
Beyond our life
Where the timeless call for life
Is lost and you will see
The forgotten dreams
That you once had become reality

They will be set free - nother day
You cannot leave if you do not want to stay
In the afterlife - in the afterlife

Life's a dream that you will forget
In the endless space
And the scars you got on planet Earth
Will be erased
You were blind until your eyes
Have stopped to see
And your powers unfold by the moment
You hit eternity

You will be set free
But you'll never return that's the price
You have to pay
In the afterlife - in the afterlife

[SOLO: Kai]

Now you're gone, without a word,
You didn't say goodbye
I miss you here, where are you now,
An angel in the sky?
Your visit here has been too short,
You left to be set free
But I believe we'll meet again
And together we will stay

In the afterlife - in the afterlife
In the afterlife - in the afterlife
In the afterlife - in the afterlife
There's no return in the afterlife

[Dedicated to Ingo Schwichtenberg]
