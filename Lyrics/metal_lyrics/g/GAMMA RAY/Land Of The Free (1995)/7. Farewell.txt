Do you remember,
How we used to play like kids in the sun
Nowadays, there's no light to see
And we're feeling cold
So the time has come
To say forewell my friends
My fale is calling loud
Now I know - it can get tough
And I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Do you - do you wanna know it
I don't care about it
Somebody said that we could never, ever die
Oh what a lie

You will see the light again
We'll all be free someday:
I know - cause united we stand

Goodbye my friends, I'm leavin' you today
My quest is hard, but I must be on my way
Now, don't ask why
Goodbye, dear Friends

[SOLO: Dirk]

Don't you try to stop me,
All I know is: I have to go!
There'll be no sense in my life at all,
If I stay
You will never see it - you will never find it
Oh yes I will!
Someone will take my place if I DIE!

[An old man said:]
Some years ago; they've tried it all before
Some men of honour left
And searched for that Land
They did not return. Now it's up to you
To play a better game - remember
When you're out there
Don't look back at all!

Goodbye my Friends, I'm leavin' you today
The Quest is hard,
I hope I'll fine a way home one day

Goodbye my Friends, I'm leavin' you today
The Quest is hard,
I hope I'll fine a way home one day
You will see the light of day
We'll all be free again
All that's left to say is FAREWELL
