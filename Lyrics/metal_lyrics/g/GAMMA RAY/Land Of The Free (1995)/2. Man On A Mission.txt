I'm a man on a mission
And my deligence won't wait
There are supersonic killers in the sky
Everything you do will analyzed,
They control every step of your life

Well, mankind has gone to a high extreme
To the dark side on the way
All I see a masquerade
And the termination waits

Oh, I've seen the faces of million leaving here
Abandoned time and places of a world
Built out of fear
The quest is drawing near
The mystery of fear is just about to clear

What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
From the never ending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again

So we travel on at speed of light
And the gods will light our way
Gotta change our part in the masterplan
For another break in the race

And the trumpet sound will soon be heard
As the dead in mind awake
And the joyfull saints will guide us
On the onward flight that we take

Oh, I've seen a million
Leaving right away from here
Abandoned time and places of a world
Built out of fear
The quest is drawing near
The mystery of fear is just about to clear

What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
From the never ending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again

Take make hand and you will see,
The mirror of your destiny
So many came to read the signs,
To understand their meaning
Now I see it's you and me,
So try to understand
And we will walk the road of life
Together hand in hand
I do not dare, I do not dare
But something's calling me
For those who dared could not break free
The one who will succeed,
I wonder, is it me?

[SOLO: Kai]

Give us a chance to live,
Give us a chance to die,
Give us a chance to be free,
Without fire from sky
Give us a chance to love,
Give us a chance to hate
Give us a chance, before you kill us all
Before you kill us, kill us all
Before you kill us all, before you kill us all
Before you kill us all

What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
From the never ending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again
