[muzax+lyrix: Hansen]

Who's controlling all the misery and pain
When the error signs are lighted in the Masterhall
And from the start the action is in vain
Cause the Beast is always careful to avoid the fall

We crawl up to the skies we'll never return again

We're the last before the storm
Watching the sun going down on us
We wish we had never been born
To be the last before the storm

Who's ever gonna change the world
I don't understand what we are fighting for
The truth is sad, no lying, we are cursed
I don't really know who ever made the Law

We cry out for more, we wonder what's next to the world
We settle the score, we never look back

We're the last before the storm...

Cry out for the people who don't know the world
They don't understand what they say and they're cursed
Lying for reasons in search for the truth

Mephisto - we comin' down [repeat]

[Solo Dirk/Kai/Melody both]

We cry out for more...

We're the last before the storm...
