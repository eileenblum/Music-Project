[muzax+lyrix: Hansen]

I crawl across the floor never see the light
Only shadows on the wall
Somebody said there's reality behind
But I'm afraid to turn and fall - oh no

Set me free - for eternity

And now they talk about my destiny again
I hear their footsteps in the dark
But then again there was the silence and the pain
Uh, Lord that made me feel so lost

Help me - get out of here
Save me - my world's an illusion

[Bass - solo/Kai/Dirk/Kai/Dirk]

I'm still inside the cave imprisoned in my mind
And silhouettes on the wall
I have to turn around to see what's goin' on
Cause what I saw was never all

Just a move is the solution
It's not enough to stand and stare
Leave the cave and find a reason
For the cross you have to bear

Never return to the principle
