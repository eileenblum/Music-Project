[muzax+lyrix+vocals: Schlachter]

We're coming closer to the final phase
You better do what you can
No you won't stand the chance to win the race
You better leave cause I'm the man
I know you think you nearly got it made

I think you live in a daydream
There's no way out

I'm gonna give you a nightmare
You get a lesson that you never forget

Your torn is over [repeat 4 times]

[hey wow!!!! it seems that they changed the whole bridge here!!! here is what they really sing and following is what's written in the booklet:]

[Think I better keep an eye on you]
[On every move that you make]
[Cause you are motherf**king liar , uuuh]
[Well, everybody knows you're fake]
[And I don't give a sh*t on what you say]

Think I better keep an eye on you
Cause you're a liar that's what they tell
There's nothing in the world that you can do
I'm gonna take you down to hell
And I don't care just what you do or say

You find yourself in a dead end, there's no way out
Poor pityful bastard, your torn is over
And I'm finished with you
(Poor pityful you, you get a lesson that you never forget)

Your torn is over [repeat 4 times]

[Solo Dirk]

I'm feeling free - you can't stop me
You can't hold me - I'm so restless
So you think you can escape your fate
Tell me sucker it's too late
See I know you gonna make my day

So you think you can save your life, if we all gonna work for you
(but you gonna get it screwed)
Better look at your size, you're nothing more than little poo
It doesn't matter what you do, I know I'm comin' over you
(say, it doesn't matter anyway)
You haven't got a single clue
Your torn is over and I'm finished with you

Your torn is over [repeat 8 times]
