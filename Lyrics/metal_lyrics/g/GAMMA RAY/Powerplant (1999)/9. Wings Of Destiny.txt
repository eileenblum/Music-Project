[WORDS &amp; MUSIC BY Richter]

Do you remember the days
When living was meant to be free
Not looking for fortune,
not looking for fame
The beauty of life was the key
We lived as one to conquer the world
A thousand dreams to come true
We knew in the end we'll find
The meaning of life and the truth
Once proud and full of passion
we formed a better world
We fought against oppression
and wisdom was our sword
On the path of glory
we searched the rainbows end
Lives meant to share,
where's the sign that we'd sent?

On sad wings of destiny
We're kings without a throne
If you believe in unity
Believe, 'cause you're not alone
Sad wings of destiny
The haunting thoughts of pain
The world's a patient majesty, but believe
The time, the time will take its toll
Now it's the time for a change
The days of your childhood are gone
The fool and the wise man
will burn at the stake
Confusion remaining too long
Violence and hate I won't see anymore
The innocent victims of fate
The prophets have written
their words on the wall
Wake up before it's too late
On the path of glory
we searched the rainbows end
Lives meant to share,
where's the sign that we'd sent?
On sad wings of destiny
We're kings without a throne
If you believe in unity
Believe, 'cause you're not alone
Sad wings of destiny
The haunting thoughts of pain
The world's a patient majesty, but believe
Believe, if you won't change your mind
All will remain the same
And soon, we'll find a common end
On the path of glory
we'll search the rainbows end
Lives meant to share,
where's the sign that we'd sent?
On sad wings of destiny
We're kings without a throne
If you believe in unity
Believe, 'cause you're not alone
Sweet child of innocence
Are you drowning in your tears?
The time has come for you my friend
Don't hide from evil made by your own hands
Let us try to fly again
One day we'll rise again
On wings of hope to be free ...
