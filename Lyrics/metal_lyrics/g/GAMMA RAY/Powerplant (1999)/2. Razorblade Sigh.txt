[Words &amp; Music by Hansen]

Out of the valley of death,
the man turns his back
Stares up to the hills, his eyes burning red
He licks his palm, with brown dried blood
Turns, grinning teeth, up to his lord
The darkness of the night
turns bright at his cry,
So quiet but deadly
Burning deep within, and now he will begin
He cries out to his lord forevermore
It's the razorblade sigh,
shooting up to the sky
Blood on the wings, one of the kings
There's a burning within,
when the storm closes in
He is one of a kind, in the hands of time
Razorblade
His raging fire burns you with desire
As you're taken down into his gravity
He wants you now, into his masterplan
And he'll be taking you into his dignity
Tires are burning on the way through hell
Fallen angel set me free
Wheels are turning, take me far below
Holding out my hands in victory

It's the razorblade sigh,
shooting up to the sky
Blood on the wings, one of the kings
There's a burning within,
as the storm closes in
He is one of a kind, in the hands of time
Razorblade, Razorblade
Death angel is coming,
you see him ride across the land
Time in his hands
The darkness of the night
turns bright at his cry
It's burning deep within
He cries for more
As I awake,
at the end of the road there's a rainbow
Slowly he'll fade, the dawning of time
On the wings of the razor ...
As I awake,
at the end of the road there's a rainbow
Slowly he'll fade away, the dawning of time
On the wings of the razorblade
