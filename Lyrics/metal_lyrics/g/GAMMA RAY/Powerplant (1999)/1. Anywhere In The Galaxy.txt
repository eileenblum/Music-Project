[Words &amp; Music by Hansen]

Staring out the window
At places in the starlit horizon
I'm waiting in the darkness
For arrival
But the sands of my time are running low
Lost and stranded far away from home
Peeping through the window in the darkness - parted in our hearts
Glowing turning circles where we go - no, they won't let go, let go
Blind our souls with raging burning madness
Out in the heavens we're ready to fight
Too late to cry
The final conclusion is roaring inside
Too proud to die
Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
Is shining for us, anywhere in the galaxy
Time is right for us to see,
the world will long for liberty
The fallen heroes calling me,
anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere ... in the galaxy
Anywhere ... in the galaxy
And now our blood is boiling
on the edge of life
Where is the place for our survival
Up to the stars, we have come from the night
Too late to cry
The final conclusion is roaring inside
Too proud to die
Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
Is shining for us, anywhere in the galaxy
Time is right for us to see,
the world will long for liberty
Fallen heroes calling me,
anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere in the galaxy,
we will fight for our destiny
Anywhere in the galaxy,
we will always run free
Anywhere in the galaxy,
Anywhere in the galaxy

And now the story finally ends,
with no disgrace for our survival
Outrageous fury in my hands,
and turning circles turn no more
Too late to cry
Out in the heavens we're ready to fight
Too proud to die
the final conclusion is roaring inside
Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
Is shining for us, anywhere in the galaxy
Time is right for us to see,
the world will long for liberty
Fallen heroes calling me,
anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere in the galaxy
