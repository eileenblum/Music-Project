[Words by Zimmermann/Hansen]
[Music by Zimmermann]

We lay our souls into your hands
and our freedom remains
We ride on wings of hope
and our star will rise again
Run before you die -
can't you hear the warning
No regrets tonight - now your end is coming
It's your sacrifice - to destroy your body
Now you pay the price -
raging fury lasts forever
Their mission is so glorious
Rising hope in all of us
There we stand united hand in hand
They come from a land far beyond
A million miles behind the sun
They come from nowhere brave inside
Strangers in the night

Time is running by - no more deadly spirals
Now we realize - pray for our survival
Eyes are shining glorious
Marching in victorious
There they stand united hand in hand
They come from a land far beyond
A million miles still riding on
They come from nowhere brave inside
Strangers in the night
They come for freedom, Come to fight
Come to save us all
We are one until we die, Waiting for the call
They come from a land far beyond
A million miles behind the sun
They come to lead us to survive
Strangers in the night
We lay our souls into your hands
and our freedom remains
We ride on wings of hope
and our star will rise again
