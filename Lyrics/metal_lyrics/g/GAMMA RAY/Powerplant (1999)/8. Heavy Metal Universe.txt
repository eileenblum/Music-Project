[Words &amp; Music by Hansen]

We're the masters of the wind
We're demons left in howl
We're the undefeated warriors
We have heard the call
We're the keepers and the leaders
Of the only thing we love
We're the saviours
and protectors from above
In our sky there is no limits
And masters we have none
Heavy Metal is the only one
'Cause it's a Heavy Metal universe
With a Heavy Metal sound
Masters of the thunder
Shake you to the ground
It's a Heavy Metal bomber
And it's never going down
Flying 'cross the universe
We're Heavy Metal bound
We're Heavy Metal bound
With a burning hot desire
Like a supersonic blast
We have come to show the world
That we have come to last
There ain't no way to stop us
And you'll never kill our pride
'Cause it's not only music
It's a chosen way of life
And our world has got no borders
And in union we all stand
'Cause Heavy Metal is our promised land
'Cause it's a Heavy Metal universe
With a Heavy Metal sound
Masters of the thunder
Shake you to the ground

It's a Heavy Metal bomber
And it's never going down
Flying 'cross the universe
We're Heavy Metal bound
We're Heavy Metal bound
See my hands held to the sky
Let me rock you 'til forever
Raise your voice we're soaring high
Swear allegiance now or never
Burning up we build a flame
As we speak the oath together
Metal is our way forever...
...way forevermore
Our world has got no borders
And in union we all stand
Heavy Metal is our promised land
It's a Heavy Metal universe
With a Heavy Metal sound
Masters of the thunder
Shake you to the ground
It's a Heavy Metal bomber
And it's never going down
Flying 'cross the universe
We're Heavy Metal bound
We're Heavy Metal bound
