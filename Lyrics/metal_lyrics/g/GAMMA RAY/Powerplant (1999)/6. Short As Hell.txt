[Words &amp; Music by Hansen]

So now we talk about destruction,
A human race that's left to die
Nobody ever will believe it
Until we face it eye to eye
Let's talk about hell
Our future shines in darkest colours,
You'll never change it, never will
Ain't nothing left now to believe in
And so we face the overkill
Hey mother mercy leave me be
Do you expect me now to cry
Time will wait for no one
Time is short as hell
Time, Time, Time, is short as hell
All is lost, into the underworld we fade
until our life is gone
count the cost,
then from the darkness wiped away
into the underworld we fade
where darkness awaits
Time will wait for no one
Time is short as hell, hell, hell
Time ...
