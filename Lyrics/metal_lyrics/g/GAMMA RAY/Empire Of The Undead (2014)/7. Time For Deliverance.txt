Angels surrounding my soul
Spread wings out of control
One life only one soul
Angels might come every day
Angels might come out to play
And if you can feel you will hear them say

That itÂ´s time for deliverance to save what we are
Time for a future with love deep in our hearts
When thereÂ´s no way out
From the cold and the dark
ItÂ´s time for deliverance for us all

Lost in a hell of illusions and darkness we lay
Forgotten in stories and tales of an ancient array
But still there is hope and someone to pray

And itÂ´s time for deliverance to save what we are
Time for a future with love deep in our hearts
When thereÂ´s no way out
From the cold and the dark
ItÂ´s time for deliverance for us all

We cannot foresee what will be in the future years
And no one might come to be saving our souls
Still thereÂ´s a reason to stand up and fight fight fight
For a tomorrow in the rays of the light

ItÂ´s time for deliverance to save our future
ItÂ´s time to unbreak the chains
And love deep from our hearts
Yes we still got a dream to follow
In the cold and the dark
Yes itÂ´s time for deliverance for us all
ItÂ´s time for deliverance for us all
ItÂ´s time for deliverance for us all ooh ooh ooh ooh
