[Bonus Track]I try donÂ´t know if I will make it
When we when we meet again
No way time will tell the answer
So I walk behind the lines to find another way

Built a world of my own itÂ´s a place I belong
ItÂ´s a world of my own makinÂ´
ThereÂ´s no reason to hide
ThereÂ´s no reason to fight 
And my world is always real

From where I stand I look around
I see the world with my eyes
How could I ever feel like you even if I tried
In the eyes of the world IÂ´m a stranger
And they say that IÂ´m one of the lost 
I am tryinÂ´ to fulfill my own way my own will
But they wouldnÂ´t let me go

Built a world of my own itÂ´s a place I belong
ItÂ´s a world of my own makinÂ´
ThereÂ´s no reason to hide 
ThereÂ´s no reason to fight 
And my world is always real
Built a world of my own
ItÂ´s my world itÂ´s always real

Built a world of my own itÂ´s a place I belong
ItÂ´s a world of my own makinÂ´
ThereÂ´s no reason to hide
ThereÂ´s no reason to fight
And my world is always real

Built a world of my own
ItÂ´s a world of my own makinÂ´
Built a world of my own
And my world is always real
