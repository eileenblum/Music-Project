[Japan Bonus Track]Yo yo come on

YouÂ´re living on your own youÂ´re living in the dark
You never realize the beating of the heart
You never wanted all the things they do and say
You wish they all go mute and slowly fade away

You wanna close the door and leave it all behind
They never care whatÂ´s goinÂ´ on inside your mind 
They always wanna tell you what to leave and what to do
And if you wonÂ´t obey them 
They tell you that you screwed

Oh time to break out

Someday theyÂ´ll understand you
Someday theyÂ´ll understand

Where is the love that IÂ´m longinÂ´ to find
All that I see are the clouds in my mind

They wanna screw you they wanna screw you
They wanna screw you they really wanna screw you
They wanna screw you they wanna screw you
They wanna screw you they always wanna screw you

YouÂ´re living in the dark youÂ´re living in a wasteland
You better kick some as before it is too late man 
They always wanna tell you what to leave and what to do
And if you wonÂ´t obey them
They tell you that you screwed

Oh time to break out

Someday theyÂ´ll understand you
Someday theyÂ´ll understand
Where is the love that IÂ´m longinÂ´ to find
All that I see are the clouds in my mind

They wanna screw you they wanna screw you
They wanna screw you they really wanna screw you
They wanna screw you they wanna screw you
They wanna screw you they always wanna screw you
They always wanna screw you 
They always wanna screw you

Time to break out

Someday theyÂ´ll understand you
Someday theyÂ´ll understand
Someday theyÂ´ll understand you
Someday theyÂ´ll understand
TheyÂ´ll understand theyÂ´ll understand
Someday theyÂ´ll understand you
Someday theyÂ´ll understand
They wanna screw you they wanna screw you
