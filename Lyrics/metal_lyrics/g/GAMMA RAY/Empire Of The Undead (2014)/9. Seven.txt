They stare at you with an evil eye
Under the cover of a winning smile
Ruthless and rotten the core

Immaculate on the outer shell
They make you jump in the wishing well
They leave you screaming back for more

Down in their temple they're feeding the fir
Watch it grows into a storm

Devil eyes and Seven snakes
Seven deadly sins await
Come on down and see the writing on the wall
Seven sinners in the hall
Seven demons heed the call
Come on down and see the writing on the wall

You'll never know what is going on
You only wait for the day to come
Fortune knocking at your door

And all that matters is to pay the bill
While other men think of how to fill
Their money bin a little more

Eyes of the snake will be watching the fire
Growing right into a storm

Devil eyes and Seven snakes
Seven deadly sins await
Come on down and see the writing on the wall
Seven sinners in the hall
Seven demons heed the call
Come on down and see the writing on the wall

Can you believe it's true
God is our only salvation
Now they are calling you
Taking you into the eye of the storm

[Solo: Henjo]

And now you stand in awe and wonder
Why this is happening to you
You're not alone, they're always watching
And now truth is hitting you

Before you all will go to heaven
Oh there is something you must know
All that you've done won't be forgiven
From those who after you will show

Prepare the eyes for watching wonders
Of jesus and his holy crew
And then the snake will come to bite you
You never had a chance you fool

Devil eyes and Seven snakes
Seven deadly sins await
Come on down and see the writing on the wall
Seven sinners in the hall
Seven demons heed the call
Come on down and see the writing on the wall

Writing on the wall
Devil eyes, Seven snakes
And it goes on...
