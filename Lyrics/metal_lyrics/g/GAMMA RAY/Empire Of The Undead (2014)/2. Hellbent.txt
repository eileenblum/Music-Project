A merciless tempest
A flash underground
Sky ripped to pieces
The flames all around
Revolts on the sidewalks
Screams in the dark
The world sinks in chaos
The world falls apart

Iâm moving on with business
Like any other day
And nothing ever stops me
Iâve found my sanctuary

A place to face the lonely race
With madness all around
Weâve found a way to get out of the game
Sharing the thing that weâve found

Hellbent for metal
Thatâs what we are
Hellbent for metal
Straight from the heart

Infernal destruction
I see the downfall
The eve of extinction
I donât care at all

The air that I breathe
Purified by the sound
The powers within make my world go around

I really canât be bothered
Like any other day
âCause I have got my music
Iâve found my sanctuary

A place to face the lonely race
With madness all around
We are the same
Weâre not playing the game
Together weâre screaming out loud

Hellbent for metal
Thatâs what we are
Hellbent for metal
Straight from the heart

With all my love
Down to the core
A metal heart
Iâm living for
