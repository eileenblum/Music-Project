Im the monster deep inside your head
I am a stranger in the dark
I am the beast that lives under your bed
I've come to tear your soul apart

I shout at the world
I've come to take you down to the dust

Fight, you'll never win
The demon lives within
Your very soul and deep inside your heart
Your pain is what I need
The suffering will feed
Demonseed

I am the ruler of your darkest dreams
I'll take you down into the fire
And I'll be here or all eternity
I am the spirit rising higher

I thrive on every sinner
I've come to you down into the dust

Fight, you'll never win
The demon lives within
Your very soul and deep inside your heart
Your pain is what I need
The suffering will feed
Demonseed

[Solo: Kai]

When the demonsoul is crawling out
And the sinner calls my name
See my mind just like an open book
With the words all rearranged

Smoldering inside of me
Growing flame from deep within
Blackened smoke that's wafting high
Bringing darkness, eating light

Oh, where do we go
Oh, where do we go
Where do we go
Where do we go from here

I thrive on all the sinning
And I was here from the beginning
And I make you bleed and crawl
I'm the end and your downfall

Fight, you'll never win
The demon lives within
Your very soul and deep inside your heart
Your pain is what I need
The suffering will feed
Demonseed

Demonseed
