I ride on down down the heavy road
IÂ´m sick and tired and my head explodes

I listen to the wind and my whip shall crack
IÂ´m riding down the road like a razorback
IÂ´m on this lonely trail forever

Burn motherfucker time to feel the flame
Listen to the whiplash crack your brain
I am the rider in the darkness
Coming for you pale rider pale rider

I spend my life with collecting souls
I get my dime in the sick man hall

I circle Â´round the world like a satellite
Killing prone demons bound to fight IÂ´ll ride forever

Burn motherfucker time to feel the flame
Listen to the whiplash crack your brain
I am the rider in the darkness
Cursed for eternity fulfill my destiny
To be a rider in the darkness pale rider

Lost in a deal with a demon to feel
That a deal with a demon is never for real
ThereÂ´s always a catch thereÂ´s always a snatch
And your soul you will sell
To the devil himself aah whoa

Burn motherfucker feel the flame
Listen to the whiplash crack your brain
Here comes the rider in the darkness
Cursed for eternity fulfill my destiny
Here comes the rider in the darkness
IÂ´m cominÂ´ for you pale rider
IÂ´m cominÂ´ for you pale rider
IÂ´m cominÂ´ for you cominÂ´ for you
IÂ´m cominÂ´ for you IÂ´m cominÂ´ for you
