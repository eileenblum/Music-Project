Running through the cold night, fever in my mind
Shadows in the haze are coming from behind
Tonight I'm gonna meet them 'cause tonight I wanna die
I wanna be an undead until the end of time
Living like the others ain't my will
Got only one desire, I wanna get my fill

Running, screaming, I'm burning for more

Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead

Something right behind me is killing all the light
It feels so good, it makes me warm, it fills me with delight
It leads me to the chapel where I will embrace the love
The ceremony is prepared, the heavens cry above
Here I'm coming, out of my way
All eternal, here to stay

Demon, vampire, wizard,
We are....

Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead

The undead are coming, I'm on their side
The undead are coming, in the night
No place in hell for me and you
So better be an undead, too

The undead are coming, we're on our way
The undead are coming, we're here to stay
The realm of shadows don't need no right
Come to the undead, escape from the light

Running through the cold night, fever in my mind
Shadows in the haze are coming from behind
Tonight I'm gonna meet them 'cause tonight I wanna die
I wanna be an undead until the end of time

Living like the others ain't my fuckin' will
Got only one desire, I wanna get my fill

Screaming, burning, undying,
We are....

Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
You wanna get your fill, you better talk to hell

Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead
Empire of the undead

Undead
