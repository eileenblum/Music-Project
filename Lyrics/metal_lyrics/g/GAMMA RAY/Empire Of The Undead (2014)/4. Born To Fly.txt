I'm your master, I'm your fate
Choice is yours, so don't be late
I'm gonna take you for a ride

Wheels are turning much too fast
Will we die to live at last
I'm gonna salve your soul tonight

Never give up
Never give in
Never get down
Nevertheless
You're gonna be free
When you're coming up with me

Flying high like an eagle
Touching rainbows in the sky
Flying high like an eagle in the sky
Born to fly

I'm a darkness, I'm a light
I'm a force that burns inside
I'm gonna set you free tonight

Never give up
Never give in
Never get down
Nevertheless
You're gonna be free
When you're coming up with me

Flying high like an eagle
Touching rainbows in the sky
Flying high like an eagle in the sky
Born to fly

[guitar solo]

Never give up
Never give in,
Never get down
Nevertheless
you're gonna be free
when you're coming up with me

Flying high like an eagle
Touching rainbows in the sky
Flying high like an eagle in the sky
We're home free

Flying high like an eagle
Touching rainbows in the sky
Flying high like an eagle in the sky
Born to fly
