You try to call me, I'm not at homeÂ 
My mobile's off, can't leave a messageÂ 
And now you're waiting, still I won't showÂ 
You won't believe what happened to meÂ 

And now I'm running like the windÂ 
But I won't have much time, I'm sorry once againÂ 
No matter where I'm going or anywhere I roamÂ 
I am the master of confusionÂ 
Maybe you'll see me coming or maybe I just don'tÂ 
I am the master of confusionÂ 

The label's calling, boys are you done?Â 
The deadline's past, time to deliverÂ 
I am so sorry, we're running lateÂ 
Some unexpected ghost in the machineryÂ 

Again I'm running like the windÂ 
Now all the made up plans are running out of handÂ 
No matter where I'm going or anywhere I roamÂ 
I am the master of confusionÂ 
Maybe you'll see me coming or maybe I just don'tÂ 
I am the master of confusionÂ 

I'm chaos, I'm disaster, I am pain, sweet disorder, anarchy, go insaneÂ 

Whenever I am closing in, your peaceful life goes in the binÂ 
Let chaos beginÂ 
No matter where we're going or anywhere we roamÂ 
We are the masters of confusionÂ 
We'll take your life apart and we don't give a damnÂ 
We are the masters of...Â 

No matter where we're going or anywhere we roamÂ 
We are the masters of confusionÂ 
We're like an open fire, a raging thunderstormÂ 
We are the masters of confusionÂ 
Masters of confusionÂ 
Masters of confusionÂ 
Masters of confusionÂ 
Masters of confusionÂ 
Masters of confusionÂ 
Masters of, masters of, masters of confusion
