I'll be back

I know that you know
That they'll never care
About the spirit of our freedom
In a world that's meant to share

And you know that I know
It's time for rebirth
When it's cold and full of darkness
and the angels left the earth

Through the eyes of time you'll see
All the pain and tragedy
never lose the will to be,
deep inside of you

I - I will return
from the light in the heavens
when man must learn
Now- it's time to turn
so bright and enlightning
the skies will burn
when I return

I stand alone here
I wait for a sign
to get a glimpse beyond illusion
let the light of wisdom shine
searching for answers
my heart's full of fear
will I face another rainbow
when the dark skies disappear

I give you shelter from the rain
a taste of freedom from the pain
Never lose the will to live -now!

I - I will return
with thunder and lightning
When all man must learn
Crucified - I never died
in times of evil and madness
the skies will burn
when I return

[Solo Henjo, Kai, Henjo, Kai, Henjo, both]

hope will wipe away the tears
break the spell of ancient fears
go and live for better days now!

I - I will return
with thunder and lightening
now all man must learn
Crucified - I've never died
in times of evil and madness
the skies will burn
when I return
the skies will burn
