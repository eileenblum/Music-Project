[Music: Hansen, Scheepers, Kusch, Wessel, Schlachter, Lyrics: Hansen]

Lookin' for a lady, walkin' through the bar
Supercool 'n' easy, he's a superstar
Talkin' to the cutie, looking pretty shy
"Move your hips around and make me smile"
"I'm the one you're looking for
'cause I am the guy"
She just turns around and says:
"Kiss my ass goodbye"

Who do you think you are, to look at me like this
Who do you think you are, not a single kiss
Who do you think you are, you're talking much to loud
Who do you think you are, get back into the crowd

Now he's getting closer, gettin' in my sight
Oh my God he's seen me, it's too late to hide
Heavy Metal monkey, silly looks and walk
Rock 'n' Roll pretender, now he starts to talk

"Nice to see you. how's it going?"
bla bla bla
I say why don't you turn around
And get back to the bar

Who do you think you are, to talk to me like this
Who do you think you are, I got you on my list
Who are you, you're talking much to loud
Who do you think you are, get back into the crowd

[Solos: Kai, Uwe, Dirk, Uli, Dirk, harmony both, Kai]

Who do you think you are, to talk to me like this
Who do you think you are, I got you on my list
Who do you think you are, you're talking much to loud
Who do you think you are, get back into the crowd
