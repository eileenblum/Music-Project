I see your picture, laughter from yesterday
Silence all around me, except the voice from the TV
And I still can't believe it's over
But time will heal all wounds I know

We sail on to dreamland, we'll meet there one day
We share our feelings, we'll be okay

Staring out the windows, dreaming of the past
The good times and the bad times, they are here to last
And I hope it's getting better
Cause time will heal all wounds, I know

We sail on to dreamland, we'll meet there one day
We share our feelings, we'll be okay
One day

Headache in the morning from wasted nights before
Welcome to the real world, knocking at the door
And I believe it's getting better
And there's one thing that I do know
