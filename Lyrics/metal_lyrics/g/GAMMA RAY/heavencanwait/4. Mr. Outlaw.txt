Innocent imprisoned the guilty got away
Got no chance to prove that I'm the wrong one
Got a bad position justice seems to fail
I don't even know what I have done

It was a case of the wrong time and place
The camera was pointing at me
Somebody else was just hiding his face
And they started searching for me

How does it feel Mr. Outlaw?
I never believed this could be
I have to walk through the outdoor
and search for my right to be free

I believed that justice would never go astray
Never thought the system could be wrong
I have done my duty every single day
There's nothing left for me now to rely on

It was a dawn when they came to my house
takin' me under arrest
They wouldn't listen I tried to explain an error
got me in that mess

How does it feel Mr. Outlaw?
I never believed this could be
I have to walk through the outdoor
and search for my right to be free

It was a case of the wrong time and place
The camera was pointing at me
Somebody else was just hiding his face
and they started searching for me

How does it feel Mr. Outlaw?
I never believed this could be
I have to walk through the outdoor
and search for my right to be free
