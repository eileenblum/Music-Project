I was walking through a misty day, the sky was cold and
grey
An old man came right up to me and said, "I know your
name."
He said he'd like to talk to me only for awhile
I had no plans, so I said OK, and he started with a sigh
and said:
"I've seen a million years pass right away.
I've seen the gods of yesterday, they're old and grey.
If you will fail, there's only one more way."

What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together, from the never ending rain
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again.

He said all life he'd been searchin' for a way to find
the clue
That love will turn the fear to hope, skies of grey to
blue.

"Let the miracle come true my friend", this is what he
said "Let's give ourselves a second chance for another
lap in the race. "And then a million stars will shine to
light our way.
And all the trears from yesterday, ... forever washed
away."

What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together, from the never ending rain
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again.

Take my hand and you will see the mirror of your destiny
So many came to read the signs, to understand their
meaning
Now I see I do not dare, but something's calling me
So many men cannot bread free, the one who will succeed,
I wonder if it's me

What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together, from the never ending rain
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again.

It's a miracle we need
Let hearts unite, so our voices shake the earth
Let us walk away together from the never ending rain
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again

We need a miracle, a miracle, a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out for the miracle
Let the stars shine on
For the miracle, the miracle on earth
Our hearts, our hearts shall unite for the miracle
