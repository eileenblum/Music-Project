I don't mind
I don't mind at all
I don't mind to dream a while
I don't mind at all

Every night I'm only waiting,
For the bird of dreams in me
Take me on your wings and guide me
Just take me on a journey far away

I don't mind to fly away to dreamland
The easy way out of a world so cold
I don't mind to say goodbye to all I see around
Only for a while

Out in the dreamworld there's a fortune
It's only waiting to be found
I gaze around and I think this must be magic
'Cause there's no limit all around

I don't mind to stay a while in dreamland
So come on now and take me up with you
If together we would fly for all eternity
I would not refuse

I had it all, I wouldn't mind my friend
To say goodbye, I'm feeling free
To stay or leave is just an easy case
Your wings will always comfort me

I don't mind to stay a while in dreamland
A place to leave my sorrows far behind
Together we will fly through Heaven and through Hell
To no man's land, no man's world

Together we will fly for all eternity
Only you and me
Only you and me
On our way to our land of the free...
