[Music by: Hansen / Lyrics by: Hansen]

Watch out the hangmen come
And there is no point in running
Keep cool the damage is done
You`ve got another thing coming
I can`t believe your world... I`d rather have it my way
Go face reality... I`ll never want it your way

No... nothing can save you
You`re gonna be dead!
Die... `cause I only hate you
All words have been said!

So much you wanna say
It`s hidden in your head
No more that I can take
I feel like being had
Your silly words will fade away... you`ve got no future
You cannot feel the pain inside... you little monster

[Chorus]
Come on down into my temple for the earth
Sit in silence and you will hear the words
And if you stay, you`ll never leave, you`ll never walk alone
The saviour of the universe is home

Waiting for tomorrow when the sorrows disappear
Look into the future from the center of my fears
Holy hell please save me from the beast from down below
Shelter me from evil and the darkness of the cold... yeah

Evil comes
Evil`s done

Waiting for tomorrow the saviour never comes
To save us from the future
The world has come undone... yeah

Evil comes... your way
Evil`s done... always... yeah

[Chorus]
Come on down into my temple for the earth
Sit in silence and you will hear the words
And if you stay, you`ll never leave, you`ll never walk alone
The saviour of the universe is home
