As You burn my dreams before my eyes,
All I've ever loved
I'm falling through an empty void,
I will not return

I'm falling from grace,
And I'm wrong in this place,
And no-one can save me today
The silence is streaming,
I wish I was dreaming,
And no-one is there who will take it away....

Hellfire - Its burning my soul, I have lost my belief
Hellfire - I burn on the flame, and I cannot break free
Ah ahhh!

Oh, I wish that I could live in peace,
Love and harmony
Someone always brings me down,
Back to misery

I'm riding a twister,
My soul is ablister,
Starting to crack on the road
In tensement he rises,
The beast tantalises,
The harvest, the people have lost all control

Hellfire - Its burning my soul, I have lost my belief
Hellfire - I burn on the flame, and I cannot break free
Ah ahhh!

[Solo]

I'm sick of the silence,
This time calls for violence,
And out of the darkness I rise
Extremely aggressive,
My senses affected,
They swear he's a hero,
I'm ready to fight!

Hellfire - Its burning my soul, I have lost my belief
Hellfire - I burn on the flame, and I cannot break free...

Hellfire
Hellfire
