[Music by: Zimmermann / Lyrics by: Zimmermann]

Master of delusion he`s sowing seeds of hate
Burning sermons, evil thoughts, he`s bound to seal our fate
Human minds infected by hypnotizing words
Foretelling lies, catastrophes, it`s time for our rebirth

[Pre-chorus]
You`re suffering from pain to clean up your karma
Following the path of no return
Blackening your soul foreswearing your freedom
Killing your hope for living life in peace

[Chorus]
Evil Messiah... the world`s set on fire
He promised salvation but sent you to hell
Almighty liar... satanic desire
Eternal damnation comes after your fall

Spiritual dictator, a murderer in white
Illuminated living god, the reaper with a scythe
A deadly operation, a mass destruction curse
Effective high-tech armoury, a raging storm unfurls

[Pre-chorus]
You`re suffering from pain to clean up your karma
Following the path of no return
Blackening your soul foreswearing your freedom
Killing your hope for living life in peace

[Chorus]
Evil Messiah... the world`s set on fire
He promised salvation but sent you to hell
Almighty liar... satanic desire
Eternal damnation comes after your fall... after your fall

You pay for your salvation enlightenment within
Renouncing the material world, your agony begins
Completely isolated from the outside world
Fellowship will make you all immortal in reverse

[Pre-chorus 2]
You`re suffering pain to clean up your karma
Following the path of no return
Blackening your soul, foreswearing your freedom
Shattering your hope for living life in peace

[Chorus 2]
Evil Messiah... the world`s set on fire
He promised salvation but sent you to hell
Almighty liar... satanic desire
A heart full of anger for no one to see
Evil Messiah...
Eternal damnation comes after your fall
