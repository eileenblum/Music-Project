[Music by: Hansen / Lyrics by: Hansen]

So here I stand again on the island of madness and pain
My fate is calling me to walk out of the dark and the rain
If I could go where I can walk, I can run, I can breathe
Where destiny is clear from the smoke and the smell of debris

I raise my hands up to the voices in the sky
Forever I must go and find the other side

[Chorus]
How can we go on from here if we don`t stop the war?
And how can we lose all the fear if we don`t stop the war?

Now you stand before me, you ask me where to go
Just go and do it your way, `cause really I don`t know

My mind is going crazy, my head is spinning round
Been searching for the saviour, he`s nowhere to be found

And when I raise my head up to the sky
Then still the question will be burning in my mind

[Chorus]
How can we go on from here if we don`t stop the war?
And how can we lose all the fear if we don`t stop the war?

How long will it take how long will it take?
How long will it take until we stop the war?

I said...

[Chorus]
How can we go on from here if we don`t stop the war?
And how can we lose all the fear if we don`t stop the war?

How long? How long? How long?
I said
How long? How long? How long?

Stop the war!
[Repeat 5 times]
Fuck the war!
Oh yeah.. yeah.. yeah..
