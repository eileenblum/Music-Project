[Music by: Hansen / Lyrics by: Hansen]

Taken where the thunder roars into the blazing light
The hand of fate is crushing down before me
The eyes of god have turned away, no angels are in sight
As I face the final chapter of our story

And now I hear the millions cry - Screaming!
Into oblivion you take their lives
Hell is thy home

[Chorus 1]
Hell is thy home... darkness thy destiny
Where you belong... no need for sympathy
The Antichrist is back again
Disguised as the savior of man

(servants of evil, breed evil)
Storm fills the clouds
I`ll wait for the fall
Sowing the end
Grace comes to fall

And now you`re waiting for a sign - Dreaming
The day is near when all the world is thine
Because hell is thy home... yeah

[Chorus 2]
Hell is thy home... darkness thy destiny
Where you belong... no need for sympathy
Again you watch the millions die
No tears in your eyes
And your followers will hail
The forces of evil won`t fail

In the great white hall
A monster`s working on the fall
It`s bloody war will kill us all

[Chorus 3]
Hell is our home... darkness thy destiny
Where we belong... no need for sympathy
Hell is thy home... darkness thy destiny
Where you belong... no need for sympathy

Hell is our home
Hell is our home
Hell is our home
