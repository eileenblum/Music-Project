[Music by: Hansen / Lyrics by: Hansen]

Clock strikes midnight in the palest moonlight
As the man walks into my bedroom
Heart in hand I hear him speak:
" My friend,
The time has come to rise, my name is Doom.
Ask no questions
There will be an answer soon. "

And we fall through the dark of the underworld
And we`re leaving the light of the day
And I know we will go to the other side
And it seems like I`m going to stay

Hell is home to the gods of the underworld
To the one who will never betray
Now my soul will be here for eternity
And the night will be leading my way

Yeah, bite me!

There was a time when hell was divine
The holy man was nailed to the cross
A fire on ice, burning inside
All my hope and loving was lost

Now hell is my home, the sadness is gone
But don`t you think my soul it is lost
If you really care just hold out your hand
And I will free you all from the cross

The priest is raising hands to do the final execution
Shouting out in agony: " Fear the cross "
I`m digging my claws into his neck and raise him to the ceiling
Gritting my teeth I smell the blood
You are lost!

[Chorus]
Blood red vengeance
I want blood red vengeance
Screaming for blood

I was walking through the darkness
Searching for a white neck to bite
I was restless and the hunger
Carried me on through the night

Yearning vampire: " Fear the cross "
Feel the undead`s... rage and lust

[Chorus]
Blood red vengeance
I want blood red vengeance
Screaming for blood

Into the dark
Blood religion
[Repeat 4 times]

[Chorus 2]
Screaming for blood - blood red vengeance
Screaming for blood - blood red vengeance
Give me your heart - blood red vengeance
I want it all - blood red vengeance
Vengeance... yeah

Give me your love... oh yeah
Oh, love me!
