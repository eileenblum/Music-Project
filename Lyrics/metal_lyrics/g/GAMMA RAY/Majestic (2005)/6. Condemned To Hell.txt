[Music by: Zimmermann / Lyrics by: Zimmermann]

Come get some!

Oppression deadly reign
Madmen gone insane
They hate and bring us pain
Bloodlust in their eyes
Getting high on torture cries
They hate and terrorize
They sacrifice

They try to break my will
They claim the right to kill
My world is standing still
I`m lost in hell
They try to make me right
A prisoner no reason why
All I try is to survive
The world`s demise

Chained in darkness - Screaming for the light!
Killing pain to save my life

[Chorus]
Condemned to hell - I`m facing the end of my days
Condemned to hell - Their torches are burning
Condemned to hell - My freedom will burn at the stake
Condemned to hell - The dark age returning

They don`t care, they close their eyes
Kick away our human rights
A world dehumanized
Now tell me... how many gave their lives?
How many have to die?
Killed by official lies
With stars and stripes

Pain and anger - Killing all the light!
Darkness comes... eternal night

[Chorus]
Condemned to hell - I`m facing the end of my days
Condemned to hell - Their torches are burning
Condemned to hell - My freedom will burn at the stake
Condemned to hell - The dark age returning

Chained in darkness - Screaming for the light!
Killing pain to save my life

[Chorus]
Condemned to hell - I`m facing the end of my days
Condemned to hell - Their torches are burning
Condemned to hell - My freedom will burn at the stake
Condemned to hell - The dark age returning

Condemned to hell
Condemned
[Repeat 3 times]

Hell! Hell!
[Repeat `till the end]
