[Japanese bonus track]

[Music by: Richter / Lyrics by: Richter]

Save my soul from anguish
Drained from fear to perish
In this world of torment
Save me, please save me from all

We`re riding on a velvet dream
Through ancient lands we`ve never seen
Far across the hands of time
Are we lost forever?

Rules and religions created to hate
To fear and incite, not to love and placate
Compassion for murders, take God`s name in vain
A fortress of evil is built up with pain

[Chorus 1]
I... I saw the signs
Enlighten my mind
Time after time
Silent tears
Shadows of fears
Search for the one
Revelation to come

Silent tears in anguish and in fears
We`re searching for the one
Where we`re all coming from

May your heart be strong and true
For life`s a gift of love to you
In my visions I have seen
The world of mystery

Leading me gently to open the door
I`m searching for answers, can`t stop anymore
Bound by this passion, my faith is unfailed
I`m holding the key to the kingdom of fate

[Chorus 2]
I follow the signs
Time after time
Enlighten my mind
Revelation take me home
Where I belong
Home to the one... yeah

I hear you calling, calling for me
Silent tears are falling
On all that is real... nothing is real

On wings of glory we shall arise
Destiny`s calling
All that is real... nothing is real

Your eyes seem so cold
So wise
Lost before they`re old

It`s our creation
We build a symphony of fears
(no more damnation)
When you reach the ancient hall
Will you trust me when you fall?
To find salvation for your soul...

Oh, is this the end?
Or will I suspend?
I will be strong, Revelation shall come

[Chorus 3]
I follow the signs
Time after time
Enlighten my mind
Revelation take me home
Where I belong
Home to the one... yeah

Silent tears will wash away
All that is real... nothing is real
Do I surrender or is this the end?
