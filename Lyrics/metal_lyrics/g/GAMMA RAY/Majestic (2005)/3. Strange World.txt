[Music by: Hansen / Lyrics by: Hansen]

Here come the riders of the revolution
Their blood is flowing in the pouring rain
Tonight there`s gonna be an execution
Another hungry king will end

Oh... all your tyrant dreams will fall when the quest will end
We`ll rise from the ashes and wait for the call
Against the masters

And we cry for deliverance
We hold the world in our hands
And come the dawn, the future is ours
Sealed with our blood in the sand

[Chorus]
It`s a strange world
A never ending circle
Oh, such a strange world
A never ending circle

Talk to me my holy friend
Why they kiss the killing hand
I fail to understand
No more... and this is the end

Strike with iron will
Time to feed the overkill
Blood flows everywhere
Now the time of hell is here
No more time to waste
All I feel is burning rage in me

I win, you lose
You`ve got nothing to say
You die, I live
Get down and pray

It`s time to kill
We strike with iron will
Here come the riders of the revolution
We fight to live
And we cannot forgive
Here come the riders of the revolution

[Chorus]
Oh yeah... it`s a never ending circle
Oh, it's a strange world
A never ending circle

Oh yeah... it`s a strange world
(a strange world, a never ending circle)
Oh, such a strange world
(strange world, a never ending circle)

Here come the riders of the revolution
Another rider crying revolution... yeah
