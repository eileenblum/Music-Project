[Music by: Richter / Lyrics by: Richter]

I see a world that`s full of fake and disillusions
I see no move in history
Where am I meant to be?
What is my destiny?
The path I`ve chosen now has lead me to a wall

And though my mind perceived I still was a blind man
And not the one who understands
For life`s a mystery...
Of things your eyes can`t see...
Faith is the key to inspiration!

[Chorus 1]
Carry on!
Carry on my dear old friend
Carry on for there`s love that never ends
Carry on... carry on, carry on, carry on

So I began to trust my instinctive feelings
To live in truth and harmony
One day you realize...
It`s right before your eyes...
Truth is the key to inspiration!

[Chorus 2]
Carry on!
Carry on my dear old friend
Carry on for love will never end
Carry on... carry on, carry on, carry on

In this world
Faith, hope and charity
Lead us to the one

[Chorus 3]
Carry on!
Carry on my dear old friend
Carry on my love will never end
Carry on... carry on, carry on

Carry on and you will see
Life ain`t no misery
Carry on, carry on, carry on

Carry on!
You`ll see the light
Your star is shining bright
Carry on, carry on!
