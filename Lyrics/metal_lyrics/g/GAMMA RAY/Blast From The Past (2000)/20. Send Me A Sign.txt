[Music: Richter / Lyrics: Richter]

Out of the dark
He came without a warning
The guarding light
I didn't see...

On a story tellers night
He spoke his words of wisdom
The tales he told from far beyond
That no one understood

He had the gift of prophecy
He wove a web of mystery
A thousend lifes shone gracious in his eyes

Send me a sign
For too long you kept me waiting
Send me a sign
From the eternal skies
Send me a sign
Send me a sign

He disappeared
In the early haze of morning
And with him left his prophecies
They didn't care...

All the years that passed away
He'slocked inside my head
His tales became reality
The prophecies he said

He was the choosen one to see
His words will burn eternally
It hurts, that no one understands

Send me a sign
For too long you kept me waiting
Send me a sign
From the eternal skies
Send me a sign
Send me a sign

He had the gift of prophecy
He gave a guarding light to me
I know, he set my spirit free

Send me a sign
Send me a sign
Send me a sign
For too long you kept me waiting
Send me a sign
To open their eyes
Send me a sign
Send me a sign
Send me a sign
Send me a sign
