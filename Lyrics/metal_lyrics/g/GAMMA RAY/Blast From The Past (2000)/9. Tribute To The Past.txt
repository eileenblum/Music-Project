[Music: Hansen, Rubach / Lyrics: Hansen]

He who found a way to leave to somewhere far from now
Traveling in his time machine a dream that had come true
Fly my friend, you will see, something called reality
I feel good, I'm alright, doing what I please - I travel time

Far beyond the rising sun - I ride the winds of fate
Prepared to go where my heart belongs - back to the past again

I just want to save the universe for all mankind
He wants to save the future of the earth
Step by step surroundings change as years go passing by
He only stops to gaze a little while
I push the button further on, I just can't get enough
I know I will return again but still I'm movin' on

Far beyond the rising sun - I ride the winds of fate
Prepared to go where my heart belongs - back to the past again

As I movin' on I see things to come,
I see fears and I hear laughter
Curiosity, comin' over me,
What is next and what will happen
And I see the lies and I hear the cries
And the marchin' of the people
As they go to war, heaven knows what for -
God I think I've had enough now

Too late, too late - I can't go back no more!
I lost control of the engine
No light, no light -
Can't see where I have gone can't see where I have gone to
Where am I now -
Stranded in time

So many years have passed since I had gone
And I have seen what's gonna be
But now I know it is useless to travel on
And I will return to the time and place I belong to.. oh!

Far beyond the rising sun - I ride the winds of fate
Prepared to go where my heart belongs - back to the past again

Far beyond the rising sun - I ride the winds of fate
Prepared to go where my heart belongs - back to the past again
