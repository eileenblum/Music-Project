[Music: Hansen / Lyrics: Hansen]

Now all you sinners this is the prophecy
The revelation of your own destiny
You had a dream once
A dream that you have sold
And now my brother
Annihilation is foretold

Will you remember ancient times
When we rode across the air
When the day of judgement comes

And when your world is gonna blow
Through your heart and take your soul
In th twilight of the sun

I believe there's no tomorrow
When we all will sink in sorrow
When the day of judgement finally comes

It's the end of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgement will come
Won't you help me now

Now tell me mother earth
Oh, we went wrong
In the heart of everyone
Do you remember how it had begun
In the desert in the twilight of the sun
All dead and gone
Can you heal me, I am not the only one
Can you feel me, I don't want to be undone
I'm everyone

Save me from this living hell
I don't wanna know another tale
Someone help me through this on the way
Hear me now

It's the end of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgement will come
Won't you help me now

All gods creation is finally dead and gone
Our revelation, the day of the judgement comes
Forevermore I stand alone
The final fury has begun
When the day has come

Guardians of the monsters of the earth
Take our lives away
And you forever will be crushed
Keepers of the darkness in this world
We will not surrender to the evil of your birth

Hope will never die
And the clear blue sunny sky
Will ease the pain
Guardians of the monsters of the earth

Lead us not into the temptation
Save us from the revelations

I stand alone, I stand alone
I stand alone, inside my head

No one can hear, noone can hear
No one can hear, my little word

Holy father take me on your wings of love
I wish that I could be forever free, oh yeah
It's the end of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgement has...

End of the world as we know it
And it's only just begun
The eyes of the world are closin' forever
When the day of the judgement has come
Won't you help me now

Now all your sinners
This is the prophecy
The revelation of your own destiny
Sleep well and dream on
The dream that you have sold
And now my brothers
This world is slowly getting cold
