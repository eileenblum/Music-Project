[Music: Hansen / Lyrics: Hansen]

Comin' out of misery,
Back to the old energy,
Takin' part in our daily show.
Think of what has been before,
Made a move and slammed the door.
Future will remain in the unknown.

Face the face of the race, try to understand.
Why are we here and what is beyond,
The wheel of our life that is spinning around.

Loud and proud, we're gonna say it now,
Live-Life-Easy
Live-Life-Easy
Everyday...

Many things to think about,
Bring me up or bring me down
A lot of things I hardly understand.
What is good and what is fair,
Problems solved, but I don't care
Sometimes it's just getting out of hand.

Tell me where, tell me when
Will I understand?
Why am I here and what is beyond?
The wheel of our life that is turning around

Loud and proud, we're gonna say it now,
Live-Life-Easy
Live-Life-Easy
Everyday...

Let us fly away, let us praise the days
When the lust for life is stronger than the fear.
Though we shiver and shake and we sometimes need a break.
It's the lust for life that never disappears.
