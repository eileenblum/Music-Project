[Music: Hansen / Lyrics: Hansen]

Staring out the window
At places in the starlit horizon
I'm waiting in the darkness
For arrival
But the sands of my time are running low

Lost and stranded far away from home
Peeping through window in the darkness
- parted our hearts
Glowing turning circles where we go
- no, they won't let go, let go
Blindour souls with raging burning madness

Out in the heavens we're ready to fight
The final conclusion is roaring inside

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
Is shinning for us, anywhere in the galaxy
Time is right for us to see
The world will long for liberty
The fallen heroes calling me
Anywhere in the galaxy

Anywhere... in the galaxy
Anywhere... in the galaxy

And now our blood is boiling
On the edge of life
Where is the place for our survivor

Up to the stars, we have come from the night
The final conclusion is roaning inside

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
Is shinning for us, anywhere in the galaxy
Time is right for us to see
The world will long for liberty
The fallen heroes calling me
Anywhere in the galaxy

Anywhere in the galaxy
We will fight for our destiny
Anywhere in the galaxy
We will always run free

Anywhere in the galaxy
Anywhere in the galaxy
