[Music: Hansen / Lyrics: Hansen]

Somewhere in the desert of the void
Beyond the wall
We're the last survivors
We're the ones who'll never fall
Men inside the circle leave the night!
Darkness all around us
Not a single beam of light
All we have is our faith
Waiting for the fight
The time has come to break the outer wall

Grab your heart I'll show you the way
Hold you head up high

High above at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free

Men inside the circle
Tell me what you feel and see
Delusions of reality
The mirror of your dreams

Hold you ground
And I'll show you the way
Now hold your head up high

High above at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free

And when the cracks appear upon the wall
We know the moments here to see it fall
And as the sunlight appears again in our sky
No wall, no more, no more will darken our life

High above at the edge of the world
We're searching for glory and peace
When the time has come, you will see
Our return to the land of the free
