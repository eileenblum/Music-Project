[Music / Lyrics: Hansen]

[Japanese bonus track]

Watch your step 'cause I'm the king
'Cause now I ain't got the blues
I am here to waste my time
I ain't got news for you
I'm sick and tired of waiting here
So what you gonna do?
No more hey, don't fool around
Get down and play it cool

Ain't got no reason
And I ain't got no rhyme
All I want is to be with you
And have a real good time

Here comes trouble, trouble
I'm going down, down, down on you
Here comes trouble, trouble
I'm going down, down, down on you

Ha ha, you know what I like, yeah

Momma can't you see me now?
I wish I could be doing
How we please but it's too late
I left a message on your mobile line
I wish I could be doing
How it's fine but I'm no saint, no

I ain't got no reason
And I ain't got no rhyme
All I want is to be with you
And have a real good time

Here comes trouble, trouble
I'm going down, down, down on you
Here comes trouble, trouble
I'm going down, down, down on you

[Guitar / Organ solo]

I ain't got no reason
I ain't got no rhyme
All I want is to be with you
And have a real good time

Here comes trouble, trouble
I'm going down, down, down on you
Here comes trouble, trouble
I'm going down, down, down on you
