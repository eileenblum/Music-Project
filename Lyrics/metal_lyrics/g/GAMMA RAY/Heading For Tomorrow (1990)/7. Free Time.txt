The weekend comes, I'm gonna see my baby.
I close the door and leave everything behind
I hit the road, the sun is shining down so brightly
Five more miles and I'm lying in her arms.

Now her motions turn me on, and I'm gonna sing my song.
Free time is one of the things that I love,
Free time is one of the things I enjoy.

The sun goes down, we're gonna see a movie.
How happy life could be without any work.
There ain't no doubt we're gonna have a party.
'Til Monday morning, noone can disturb.
