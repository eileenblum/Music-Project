I don't need no money, I will stuck to my ideals.
You better get some money, you better get yourself a deal.
I won't change my habits and throw it all away.
No, no, you better keep it all together for another day.

Money - uh, yeah
It only makes me sick and makes the people turn to fools.
It only gives you power and power makes the rules.
Don't wanna be an asshole that sits on dollar bills.
Ha, ha, ha, I know you'll take it no matter how you feel.

Money - uh, yeah.
Nothing will get for free, illusion or reality,
The mirror of your dreams is made of cash.
It drives me wild and drives me crazy,
Makes me fat, and makes me lazy.

Anything you want, anything you need
If I had a little money I would feel okay.

It is money that rules the world,
it is money that lights the day.
It is money that makes it work,
it is money that makes you live!

Money, money, money, money
Give me money -everybody wants some.
Everybody needs some.
I want more, you want more, we want more, they want more.
Nothing you will get for free, illusion or reality.
