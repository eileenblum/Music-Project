Where will I go now? It's all over
Where will I be now? All is said and done
Here comes the time, prepare for justice
Seems like my final journey has begun

Riding on the wind, there's only one place left to go
Take me to my afterlife high up or down below

Heaven or Hell
Where do we go when we are leaving?
Heaven or Hell
Whatever comes to set us free
Heaven or Hell
I've gone a long way and I see there's no wishing well
The choice is made, it's Heaven or Hell

I'm not the one who was expected, so I'll return and be from heaven sent
I'm gonna get myself elected and now I wanna be the president
"Viva el Presidente"

Master of the Damned - I'll be the savior of you all
Take me as a Holy God to save you from the fall

Heaven or Hell
Where is my final destination?
Heaven or Hell
Whatever comes to set us free
Heaven or Hell
We've gone a long way and we see there's no wishing well
The choice is made, it's Heaven or Hell

Master of the Damned, I'll be the savior of you all
I'm your revelation, I'm a walking miracle

Heaven or Hell
What is our final destination?
Heaven or Hell
Where do we go from here?
Heaven or Hell
We've gone a long way and we see there's no wishing well
The choice is made, it's Heaven or Hell

Heaven or Hell! It's Heaven or Hell
There's no wishing well - it's Heaven or Hell
