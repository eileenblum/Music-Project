[Music: Hansen / Lyrics: Hansen, Scheepers]

In the morning your try to recover
But you still got the red in your eyes
Then you get up and look at the mirror
And you see the beast arise
Got a big red nose from the overdose
And somebody else's eyes
And you think to thee is it really me
And you have to realize

The prize that you pay for a moment like this
Is never for high 'cause you still doing it
Don't you know that we all stand in line
Our future dreams are just a waste of time

[Chorus:]
Our future - is a madhouse and we all are movin' in
Cause the world - needs some action and there nothing left to gain

Take your baggy, things are ready
You only need to come
Join this century's schizoid clan
The rooms are primed and done

The price that you pay for a moment like this
Is never too high cause it perfectly fits
Don't you that we are wasting time
Insanity is just a state of mind

[Chorus]

[Solo: Kai/ Dirk/ Kai]

Our world - is a madhouse, in the gutter, come on in
Our world - needs some action satisfaction 'til the end
Our world - we need sex and crime to supply our minds an amazing time, come on in
Our future - and we party on 'til our life is done
Just to waste our time - 'til the end
