[long version]
[Music/Lyrics: Frenzel]

The world's desperated with irony, hunger and corruption
The eastern world and the africans, too
Are going to repeat the history of all wars
And our industry supplied them with arms
Everybody knows but nobody can do anything against it
The fall of society is on the make

Well sometimes, sometimes I try to draw up a list
I try to find out what they have done
I thought of honorable murderers you know
Like Jonah's hand might wrap around us

And anytime, everywhere in the world ...

[Chorus:]
Gamma Ray, Gamma Ray, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma Ray,
Made of your existence
Gamma Ray, Gamma Ray, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma Ray,
Money and our failing
I've waited for... to fire gamma ray!

Without body I could fly around the world
Destroying arms, destroying rockets
Mix all complexions of the whole human race
We all would turn to shallow people

Everybody, everywhere in the whole world

[Chorus]

Without body I could fly around the world
Destroying arms, destroying rockets
Mix all complexions of the whole human race
We all would turn to shallow people

[Chorus]
