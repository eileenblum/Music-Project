I dream of a winter
When skies are opened wide
Death loses meaning
In absence of life
Apart from the swarming
And everything that grows
By silence of mountains
Never melting snow

Ice draws a new world
In the distance to move on
Isolated from reality
Full of none

I call for a tragic spell
Among blazing hearts
Where to find a shelter
Diverging from their light
Along for desolation
At every rumbling dawn
War toward an instinct
Majestic, withdrawn

Ice draws a new world
In the distance to move on
Isolated from reality
Full of none

Ah, full of none...
Behold the prophecy is revealed...
I have seen the haze frozen on glass...

Ice draws a new world
In the distance to move on
Isolated from reality
Full of none

Full of none (Full of none)
Full of none
Full of none, full of none, ho-o-oh
Full of none
