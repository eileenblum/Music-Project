The vision is so clear
I feel it on my face
Here at the olden lake
A stare into the waves

Summer is on the wane
The wind whispers to the waterfront
Where the hidden streams
Came alive up from the dark unknown

(Oh) Wandering where the skylines grow
(Oh) Until the sun sinks down below
(Oh) An ancient fire starts to glow

Spilling seeds of red into the lake
Spilling blood, let the water know my faith
Just let it flow, just let it flow
Just let it flow, just let it flow
I wanna go so let it flow
I wanna go so let it flow

The vision is now real
I've returned to stay
Nothingness is near
One with the endless plain

Summer is on the wane
It's all the same but without human lights
Not any single soul
Roams the land, violates the perfect night

Spilling seeds of red into the lake
Spilling blood, let the water know my faith
Just let it flow, just let it flow
Just let it flow, just let it flow
I wanna go so let it flow
I wanna go so let it flow

(Oh) Wandering where the skylines grow (The skylines grow)
(Oh) Until the sun sinks down below (The sun sinks down below)
(Oh) An ancient fire starts to glow (An ancient fire glows)
(Oh) I hear the call so let it flow
