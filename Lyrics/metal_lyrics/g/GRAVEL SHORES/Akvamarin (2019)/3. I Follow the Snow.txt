No-o, no-o
No-o-o-o
No-o, no-o
No-o-o-o

On a wintry dawn I felt
I belong to the snow that fell
From iron colored skies
I'm under a cold white spell

You're my only guide, my only guide
As you shine my way across the night
With you I die, with you I die
Every single spring when blooms arrived

I follow the snow
I follow the snow
I follow the snow
Saying no, no, no
I follow the snow
I follow the snow
I follow the snow
Saying no, no, no

No-o, no-o
No-o-o-o
No-o, no-o
No-o-o-o

As a glacial gateway sets
I finally lose my consciousness
I'm nobody now at last
The leveling flakes will hide the rest

You're the End, you're the End
On your freezing might we all depend
I'm hand in hand, I'm hand in hand
With the chiming vibe of your farewell chant

I follow the snow
I follow the snow
I follow the snow
Saying no, no, no
I follow the snow
I follow the snow
I follow the snow
Saying no, no, no

No-o, no-o
No-o-o-o
No-o, no-o
No-o-o-o

I follow the snow, I follow the snow
Follow the snow

On a wintry dawn I felt
I belong to the snow that fell
