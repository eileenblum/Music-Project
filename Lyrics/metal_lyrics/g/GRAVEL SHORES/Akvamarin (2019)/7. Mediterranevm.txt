Savory scent of a damned coast
What lived underwater, now lays in foam
Here you can find what's truly me
Unlock the seal of a shell decayed

Mediterraneum
Inhale the fate, it drops upon your face
Mediterraneum
Inhale the stench, it drops upon your hand
Mediterraneum
Inhale the fate, it drops upon your face
Mediterraneum

Look at the rocks guarding the bay
Seasons go by, they stay the same
Slower than we could ever see
They're losing their war against the waves

Mediterraneum
Inhale the fate, it drops upon your face
Mediterraneum
Inhale the stench, it drops upon your hand

(Mediterraneum)
Savory scent of a damned coast
What lived underwater, now lays in foam
Here you can find what's truly me
Unlock the seal of a shell decayed!
(Mediterraneum)

The tears will flow
Back to the whole
It whirls and holds (It holds)
The utmost poles

Mediterraneum
Inhale the fate, it drops upon your face
Mediterraneum
Inhale the stench, it drops upon your hand
Mediterraneum
