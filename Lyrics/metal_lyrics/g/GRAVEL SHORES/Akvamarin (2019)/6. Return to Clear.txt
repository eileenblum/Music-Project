Climbing in cold
Impureness, it's carried all along
The fjord unfolds
Wise waters are hungering for faults
So much untold
Go destroy the proves

No one have seen us when we have been in glow
Inferior
Oh we've been walking the feral dimensions
Inferior
You, carnal longing, now you will sink below
In name of, in name of Anti-Life

Nights, dreams keep hauntin' on
Nights, dreams keep hauntin' on
The rite is near, return to clear

Envisioned scenes
Of no love, but a hated selfish need
Throwing this filth
Off the mountain, it shall lie in nordic deep
Splash of redeem
Getting rid of me

No one have seen us when we have been in glow
Inferior
Oh we've been walking the feral dimensions
Inferior
You, carnal longing, now you will sink below
In name of, in name of Anti-Life

Nights, dreams keep hauntin' on
Nights, dreams keep hauntin' on
The rite is near, return to clear
I return to clear
