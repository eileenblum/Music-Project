I'd be the mist
Dressing the hills at dawn
To pass away
With the first sign of the Sun

I'd be the voice
Of an autumn crawling down
A silent spell
For trees to lose their crown

A landscape I know so well from afar
The closer I get it's falling apart

I'd be but no
These fantasies are false
Don't ask for more
I won't be at all

A landscape I know so well from afar
The closer I get it's falling apart

Gazing below with the rain, the rain in the skies
Gazing below with the rain, the rain in the skies
How long I long for the state of no lives
How long I long for the state of no lives
How long I long for the state of no lives
How long I long for the state of no lives

How long I long for the state of no lives
