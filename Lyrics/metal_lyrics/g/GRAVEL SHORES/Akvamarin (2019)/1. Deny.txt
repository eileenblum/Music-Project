Take a walk, take a walk as a roaming child
Marvel-struck in the forest wild
Days are gone, days are gone, aeons went by
Tragedies enlightened the heart

Among the woods, among the woods in a pagan dome
A fool belief, this place means home
The principle had been arrived
Everything, everything has to be died

Order is where nothing moves
By necrotic rules

Deny the Earth
Deny all your own
Deny all your own
Deny the Earth

Land and sea, sea and air is poisoned by
The dwelling ones, they came alive
To fill the globe, to own it all and spread their kind
Against this madness void shall come

Order is where nothing moves
By necrotic rules
It makes me sick to watch it go
Seeds reach their goal

Deny the Earth
Deny all your own
Deny all your own
Deny the Earth

(Deny, deny, deny) Deny the Earth
(Deny, deny, deny) Deny all your own
(Deny, deny, deny) Deny all your own
Deny the Earth
(Deny, deny, deny) Deny the Earth
(Deny, deny, deny) Deny all your own
(Deny, deny, deny) Deny all your own
Deny the Earth
Deny the Earth
