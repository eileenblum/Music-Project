I've lost the point
Do we need to be at all
Material
I can't believe
How we crave to stay alive

Spiritual age is about to rise
Just listen to your heart

You'll see what's real
If there's a twilight, o-oh
You'll see what's real
When every tower will fall

When every tower will fall

Oh read the stars
We have to change, we'll cease to be
Ceremonial
Blinded eyes
We have lost our key to live

Devotional as in the old world
Just listen to your heart

You'll see what's real
If there's a twilight, o-oh
You'll see what's real
When every tower will fall

The earth is bleak and no dawn shall come
The earth is bleak and no dawn shall come
Mind over matter
Mind over matter

You'll see what's real
If there's a twilight, o-oh
You'll see what's real
When every tower will fall

You'll see what's real
If there's a twilight, o-oh
You'll see what's real
When every tower will fall
