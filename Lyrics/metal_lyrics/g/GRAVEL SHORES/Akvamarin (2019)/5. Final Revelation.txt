Winter storms awake in me
When I'm shivering inside
Of a sparkling summer day

Nocturnal chant of rain beaten leaves
It's a channel for emptiness
To let it spring

A final revelation (O-o-oh)
A final revelation (O-o-oh)
It's all you try to know
Is on the way to be no more

Woeful clouds, they speak thru me
And they say we got no sense
To see beneath the veil

The formlessness is drawing near
To dissolve a captive soul
From this mortal clay

So I will fold my arms
To keep the heat outside
I know I'm trembling
But I'm trembling by its might
So I will fold my arms
To keep the heat outside
I know I'm trembling
But I'm trembling by

A final revelation (O-o-oh) (A final revelation)
A final revelation (O-o-oh) (A revelation)
It's all you try to know
Is on the way to be no more (No more, no more)
A final revelation (O-o-oh) (A revelation)
A final revelation (O-o-oh) (A final revelation)
It's all you try to know
Is on the way to be no more (The way, the way)
A final revelation
