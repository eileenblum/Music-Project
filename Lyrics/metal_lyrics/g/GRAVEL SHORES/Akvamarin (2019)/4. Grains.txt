I've heard your voice, an ancient word
An invocation for an empty world
I had a thousand names, I'm everything
Thus I'm the matter and the drive within

The grains of solitude I plant into the minds
To let them bud
As the hour will come they'll do the same as one
Your will be done

A feathered serpent on a breaking wave
From beyond the spheres I've taken shape
I had a thousand names, I have no end
With incessant hunger for blood of men

The grains of solitude I plant into the minds
To let them bud
As the hour will come they'll do the same as one
Your will be done
Your will be done!

The evidence I found was far enough to know
When I've been in you
The bitterness I found was far enough to know
When I've been in you, o-o-oh

The grains of solitude I plant into the minds
To let them bud
As the hour will come they'll do the same as one
Your will be done
