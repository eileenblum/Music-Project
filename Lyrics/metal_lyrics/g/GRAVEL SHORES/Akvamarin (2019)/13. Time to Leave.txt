A solitary morning
Outside an autumn's falling
Daylight's buried well behind the leaden clouds

This is the point when all began
Alone within the crowd
Me and the ever waning, ever wasting years on end

Is it a time to leave?
I got to keep believe
As the oldest lifelong feeling guides
Is it a time to leave?
I got to keep believe
My early memories like leading lights

Together with the raindrops
They turn the scene so grievous
That atmosphere have left in me, baptized by gloom
Ever since I can remember
I keep staring the path
The elder ones will soon arrive to release me from my tomb

Is it a time to leave?
I got to keep believe
As the oldest lifelong feeling guides
Is it a time to leave?
I got to keep believe
My early memories like leading lights

Awaiting to depart (Depart)
High hopes in the heart (The heart)
Dreaming till it starts (It starts)
A great rise beyond the stars

Is it a time to leave?
I got to keep believe
My early memories like leading lights
