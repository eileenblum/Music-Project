All is told and nothing changed
I spread my wings
To head towards a shrouded land
A freezing plane
On a mountain top in storming skies
Echoes break the ice

The ground opens up, hear the growl
Blackness rises on
The ground opens up, hear the growl
Blackness rises on North

(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise)
(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise) Oh Blackness rises on
(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise)
(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise) Oh Blackness rises on

Abominate the forthcoming
To spend uncounted years
Know the stream where every word flows from
Right inside of me
Escaping again to this very source
Beyond the Ravenrealm

The ground opens up, hear the growl
Blackness rises on
The ground opens up, hear the growl
Blackness rises on North

(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise)
(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise) Oh Blackness rises on
(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise)
(Ri-ri-rise rise on a rise) Oh Blackness rises on

The ground opens up, hear the growl
Blackness rises on
The ground opens up, hear the growl
Blackness rises on
