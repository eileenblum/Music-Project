If it's a way to call upon the sacred wind
The tracks I trod, cover them all, don't wanna trail
And heave me please
Heave me please

Too much joy, too much times I've forced to see
A desecrator of all that ever been
Made me believe
We're not in vain

Salt turns the stone to dust
Temptations ever lost

It shall be a way to call upon the salted wind
Blows from the coast, carries its timeless mystery
To make my way (make ways in the mass, make ways in the mass now)
Make my way

Malicious joy, malicious times I've forced to see
A desecrator of all that ever been
He made me perceive
We grew in vain

Salt turns the stone to dust (Salt turns the stone to dust)
Temptations ever lost (Temptations ever lost)
Salting the years of past (Salting the years of past)
With essence of Absu, essence of Absu
