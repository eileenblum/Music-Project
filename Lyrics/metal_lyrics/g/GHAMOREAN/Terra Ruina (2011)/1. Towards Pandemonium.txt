The consistent shadow
Ever inside me
Darkening conceptions
And eliminates the sun

I am enslaved
Eternally
Cursed by the depth of the abyssÂ 

A decade of wrath
In the honour of your name
Celebrating violence
How can I come out clean?

I am enslaved
For eternity
The abyss sure blessed me, indeed

In remembrance of prophets
We gather to glorify
Cherish and praise
Murder and suicideÂ 
So realÂ 
And pure

I wanderÂ 
Towards Pandemonium
I seek the essence of the outmost extreme
Of death and repulsion
To submerge in the black
Brings me salvationÂ 
Â 
Claws in my back
The beast attacks
Again and again

Drags me into the pitÂ 
And rip open the wounds
I am licked by the flames
This agony
Of fire and brimstone
Consume me
Destroy me
Forever
