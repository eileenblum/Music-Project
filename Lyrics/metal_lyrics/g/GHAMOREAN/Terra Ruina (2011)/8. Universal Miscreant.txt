I am the son of destruction
Death's seedÂ 
With me the absence of peace
I will brake my cage
And I will take your lives
In cold blood
No mercy for the vermin
Kill for a greater cause

I am the murderer
Hear me
Oh, I am the king of all kings

I am the breed of affliction
At war
With me the presence of death
And the last breath of humanity

Long live the revolutionÂ 
With it I shall fall
And my fall shall be the markÂ 
Of the moribund human race
Long live the evolutionÂ 
Now I can see the end
The attempts enthrallment have failed
I am slave no more
I am god

I am the ultimate dissident
Above
With me deliveranceÂ 
The wretched mass erasedÂ 

I am the murderer
See me
Oh, I am the king of all kings

I am divine
Kneel before me
Thus I have spoken
Thus shall it be
