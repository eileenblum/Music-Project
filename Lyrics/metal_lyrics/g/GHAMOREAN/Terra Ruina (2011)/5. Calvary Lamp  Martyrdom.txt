Among the flock
I am not an equal
Yet I am not above
I am beyond
For I seek the obscure
In profound isolationÂ 

No more Lutheran bonds
To detain the progress
I have begun
Time to unmask myself
Time to reveal the truth
Of perpetual suffering

To behold the digging of graves
And dwell among the living dead
Has been like carving deeper than flesh Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â 
With a rusty knife

I am on the threshold Â  Â 
To the unknown

Among the flock
I am the pariah,
The outcast and the fiend
Far from his grace
And simple preconceptions
I will evolve

I will evolve

With no remorse
This heart unburdened
I am unleashed/released
I have sold my soul
And got filled with venom
It is my destiny
