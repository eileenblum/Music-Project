Grant me the strength
To glance beyond deception
Grant the will Â 
The pride and the insistence
For me to ascend

Grant me the wrath
To destruct and lust to reinvent
Grant the fire
The flame of sheer dissentÂ 
Ignite

Fear me
Envy me
Hate me
Worship my icon

Grant me divinity

I amÂ 
The father
I amÂ 
The son

Ego Enim Dominus

I am the lord
