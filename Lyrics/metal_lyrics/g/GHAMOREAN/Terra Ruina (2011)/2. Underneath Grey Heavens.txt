To persist among the fatuous
I must clench my teeth
And ignore the pain
They provide my soul
I endure their smiles
But I can smell the fear
Of veracious cuts
About to pierce their skin

I bleed constantly
I have welcomed the blade
With open arms
Now, open my veins
And as the bloodÂ 
Creates a river
For them all to drown
Any repentance
I feel not

I fail to see the purpose
Let the venom flow
Underneath grey heavens
The eyes in fury glow

To solve the enigma
And find deliverance
I sacrifice
Their false solaceÂ 
I am the damned
Harvest of scorn
They face me in awe
To realize

Helpless they reach for salvation
And I will continue to bleed

I fail to see the purpose
Let the venom flow
Underneath grey heavens
The eyes in fury glow
