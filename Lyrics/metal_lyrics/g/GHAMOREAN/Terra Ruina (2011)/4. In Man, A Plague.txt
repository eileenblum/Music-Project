This time I am on my knees
Like the slave I serve
Yet within the torment
Of a fading flame

Fettered upon deceit
Tainted naked corpus
The bitter taste of defeatÂ 
And the stench of a rotting whore

Become the serpentÂ 
Wolf and the lion

Liberation
I shall ever seekÂ 
Liberation

He who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence

End the stagnation
Rise from the abyss
Detach the strings
And reach for the last befalling of freedom
It is time

Embark the rebellionÂ 
Or cling to negation
Cease the new dawn
Or incite the chime of the funeral bells
The funeral bells

Liberation
I shall ever seekÂ 
Liberation
