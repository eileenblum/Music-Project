Strive to unite the intelligent specieÂ 
You will always be betrayedÂ 
Stabbed from within the circleÂ 
Murdered by your own
For the unsaid is always self fulfillmentÂ 
To rise above the others

Cruelty dwells inside usÂ 
Lessons are unlearnedÂ 
Mass hypnosisÂ 
The manifest of our inferior mind

The absence of good, is the presence of man
The enlightened laughed as we destroyedÂ 
The last remnants of hopeÂ 
Under sulphurous skies we shall perish

Proclaim holy war (on the scapegoat)
Â 
Never again, but forever moreÂ 
The self deceit continuesÂ 
The solution is not freedomÂ 
Mankind cannot be freeÂ 

Kindness is fading
Hate is revealedÂ 
We shed our skinsÂ 
And strike down on the weak

The absence of good, is the presence of man
The enlightened laughed as we destroyedÂ 
The last remnants of hopeÂ 
Under sulphurous skies we shall perish
