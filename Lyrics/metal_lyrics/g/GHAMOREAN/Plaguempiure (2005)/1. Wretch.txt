On your knees for something greaterÂ 
Satisfaction by illusionÂ 
Superficial horrified soulÂ 
Fighting to cope another blank day

Truly beneath you spend your time in fearÂ 
Not worthy any sort of compassionÂ 
Nor even considered alive

Darkness - will soon be here and you are unawareÂ 
Cold - yes, cold it will be and you are so unprotectedÂ 
Agony - you will suffer in a way not able to imagineÂ 
Solution - this is the harsh and final truth

No pity, no mercyÂ 
You will get what you deserve

On your knees in desperationÂ 
Slashed veins empty eyesÂ 
This time all hope for you is lostÂ 
Your days are numbered
