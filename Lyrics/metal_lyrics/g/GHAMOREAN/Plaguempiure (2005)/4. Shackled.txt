All of you believersÂ 
Listen to the words of purityÂ 
Your lives are threatenedÂ 
Yet what is your point of being alive

Youâre hanged in the rope of submission
Forever caught in the filthy religious fantasiesÂ 
Unaware about the world outsideÂ 
When reality strikes you will die

A life in shackles and illusionsÂ 
Condemned to mental captivityÂ 
Still you breathe, still you breedÂ 
Your lungs must stop to be filledÂ 
Your seed must be infertile

So all of you belonging to the grey-faced raceÂ 
This is a statement of sagacityÂ 
Your lives are endangeredÂ 
Yet what's your point of existence

Youâre hanged in the rope of submissionÂ 
Forever caught in the filthy religious fantasiesÂ 
Unaware about the world outsideÂ 
When reality strikes you will die
