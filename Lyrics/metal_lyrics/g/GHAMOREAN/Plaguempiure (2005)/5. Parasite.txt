With filthy handsÂ 
And eyes looking another directionÂ 
The human moral debrisÂ 
Leads to natures final breathÂ 

Dirty lifeless winds sweep aroundÂ 
The disguised raw smell of death is inhaledÂ 
Ignorant and brutal machinesÂ 
Killing without remorseÂ 
In their harsh journey

With filthy handsÂ 
And eyes looking another directionÂ 
The human moral debrisÂ 
Leads to natures final breath

The parasite in man abusing every inch of the earthÂ 
Nothing left behind to grow strong as jaws of rust opensÂ 

Still the rape isn't completedÂ 
And subsequently another will be committedÂ 
To this we can never raise a white flagÂ 
And let what is left to corrosion

We must show no mercyÂ 
To those who let this pass without reactionÂ 
We must let them burnÂ 
Let them feel the splendour of purification

Time has come to destruct the source of dirt and filthÂ 
To rebuild the land we once came from

The parasite in man abusing every inch of the earthÂ 
Nothing left behind to grow strong as jaws of rust opensÂ
