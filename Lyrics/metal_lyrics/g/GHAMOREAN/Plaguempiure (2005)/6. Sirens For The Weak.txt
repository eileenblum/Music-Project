The age of reason
Knowledge has vanquished the liesÂ 
God left the throne to return to obscurityÂ 
The tools of oppression have lost their edges
Disarmed our minds
Torn from the chains, follow your own pathÂ 
No deity dictates your lives

You - the blind fools of JHWHÂ 
Follow the voice of the unseenÂ 
Plunge into hypnosisÂ 
Deny the blood on the cloakÂ 
You bow to the holy symbol - the sign of warÂ 
Now cut the ties, bite off the hand that feeds you
It is feeding sedatives, to break the free mind

The return to the Dark Age!

Yet, some shiver and cry, weâre doomed to be freeÂ 
A vacuum where god used to beÂ 
Fill it with the pleasure and the spoils of victoryÂ 
No one lights your path

You can follow the new messiahsÂ 
They will strip you off your willÂ 
Bring you back to your cellÂ 
Death camp for the human mind

Perhaps you awake from the slumberÂ 
Scared by your ignoranceÂ 
Ashamed of your dogma
But can you walk amongst the others?Â 

Return to reason and be king of yourselfÂ 
No one whips you in to submission

You - the blind fools of JHWHÂ 
Follow the voice of the unseenÂ 
Plunge into hypnosisÂ 
Deny the blood on the cloakÂ 
You bow to the holy symbol - the sign of warÂ 
Now cut the ties, bite off the hand that feeds you!
It is feeding sedatives, to break the free mind
