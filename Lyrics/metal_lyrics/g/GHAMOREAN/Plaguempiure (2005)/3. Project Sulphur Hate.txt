We received this gift since birth
Were given a higher existence
We bear sovereigntyÂ 
The genuine knowledge is ours

We are the ones of supremacyÂ 
We are the token excellenceÂ 
We bring transformationÂ 
The future belongs to us

We can see the end of diseaseÂ 
We can hear the waves of alterationÂ 
The last breath of pestilenceÂ 
As the daybreak will rise

We can see the scytheÂ 
We will hear your criesÂ 
The coming of demiseÂ 
As the time is here

Project sulphur hateÂ 
Unleashed to dominateÂ 
Project sulphur hateÂ 
Against all forms of religion

The release of chains tied around believersÂ 
The cleansing of holy dirtinessÂ 
The new order created after chaosÂ 
The absolute utopia without abdication and lies

We can see the end of disease
We can hear the waves of alteration
The last breath of pestilence
As the daybreak will rise

We can see the scytheÂ 
We will hear your criesÂ 
The coming of demiseÂ 
As the time is here

Project sulphur hateÂ 
Unleashed to dominateÂ 
Project sulphur hateÂ 
Against all form of religion

Project sulphur hateÂ
