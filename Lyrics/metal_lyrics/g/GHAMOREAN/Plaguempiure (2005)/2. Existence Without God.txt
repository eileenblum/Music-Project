Live as a human, live as a snakeÂ 
Cold blooded reptile all you have is fateÂ 
Pretend to be angels, the greatest creation of allÂ 
Your mind is your betrayer
Keeps you in denial

All your foundations will trembleÂ 
Before the superiority of natureÂ 
Humans, tread the path of extinction
Behold the horsemen of the apocalypse
Taste the bitterness of defeatÂ 
Cry as you are struck by insightÂ 
The reason was youÂ 
The self proclaimed messiah

Observe the retaliatorÂ 
Breaking your shackles
Clouds will gather
You have sealed your own fate
Geniuses of suicide
You are the architects of your own demiseÂ 
The final downfall

Mankind is not a blessing, it is a curse
A deadly disease spread like fireÂ 
The only solution is self terminationÂ 
To end abuse and betrayal

Yet keep in mind, specie of traitorsÂ 
No greater power will judge youÂ 
Your existence is without godÂ 

All your foundations will trembleÂ 
Before the superiority of natureÂ 
Humans, tread the path of extinctionÂ 
Behold the horsemen of the apocalypse
Taste the bitterness of defeatÂ 
Cry as you are struck by insightÂ 
The reason was you
The self proclaimed messiah

Stand in awe for the onslaught of the elementsÂ 
Kings of the earth, true creators of ArmageddonÂ 
The day of revenge, no one is spared
You came and brought destruction
Witness the scorching of the skiesÂ 
And the collapse of mountainsÂ 
As the creation erases all trace of mankind
Yet keep in mind, specie of traitorsÂ 
No greater power will judge you
Existence is without godÂ
