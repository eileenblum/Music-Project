I take command
With strength and discipline
To seek the path beyond
Where I walk alone

I have left the plague Â 
The rope around my neck
A dead end made by those
Who long for death in chains

I amÂ 
I will

Judge me not, ye who spat upon my soul
Freedom is the reward to those who defy
I dare you not, to stand in this way of mine
No cheek will be turned, I give as I receive

I give as I recieve

Persistent and in control
I behold the flag of captivity
To such I pledge no allegianceÂ 
I smile as I blasphemeÂ 

I amÂ 
I will

I face my call
My reason the creation
Feeds me with pride
Gives me an end so glorious

I stand tall
SuperiorÂ 
To greet the abyss
When my words become silentÂ
