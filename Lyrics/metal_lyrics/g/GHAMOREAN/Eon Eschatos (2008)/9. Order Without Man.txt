The world in order
He will guide you
Foundations stable
Upon the earth of god
The signs ignored
Omens unseen
Gives you peace of mind
To enter pearly gates

"But I welcome you to the real world - a world you did not know
I bring the light for you to see - as a son of the morning"

The world disorder
He won't guide you
Foundations ruined
By hands of overpower
Accept apocalypse
And order is restored
Your death's desired
The land of man devouredÂ 

The land of the holy
Created by visions of utopia
An empire built on virtue
Constructed by strict obedience Â Â 
Yet now obvious and realised
The human specie is honourless
An apprentice of the serpent
With lips of duplicity
Enlightened yet merciless
Self-destructive monster
Creator of the intolerable darkness

"I welcome you to the real world - a world you did not know
I bring the light for you to see - as a son of the morning"

The world is silent
Life's erased never to return
Chaos brought the order
The order without manÂ 

The land of the holy
Created by visions of utopia
An empire built on virtue
Constructed by strict obedience Â Â 
Yet now obvious and realised
The human specie is honourless
An apprentice of the serpent
With lips of duplicity
Enlightened yet merciless
Self-destructive monster
Creator of the intolerable darkness
