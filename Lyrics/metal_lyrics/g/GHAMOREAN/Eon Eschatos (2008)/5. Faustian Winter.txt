Obstructing the pursuit of perfection
The decline and the loss of excellenceÂ 
We will destroy more than we achieve
In the strive of the faustian soul Â  Â Â 

We are but slaves under the whipÂ 
Of a goal we will never reach
The ruin of our empire
Created by our own mortal weakness

Constantly searching the unattainable
But secretly knowing that the cataclysmÂ 
Led by the conviction in manÂ 
Is upon even the highest of cultures

We are but slaves under the whipÂ 
Of a goal we will never reach
The ruin of our empire
Created by our own weakness

Faustian WinterÂ 
The sun debilitates
Faustian WinterÂ 

"As we set ourselves higher than nature,Â 
and with our ambition to control even the light from the sun,
we will create the final grave of mankind."

The ultimate death process begins
By mephistophelean principles
Souls gradually corroding
Our protracted fall is at handÂ 

Faustian WinterÂ 
The sun debilitates
Faustian WinterÂ
