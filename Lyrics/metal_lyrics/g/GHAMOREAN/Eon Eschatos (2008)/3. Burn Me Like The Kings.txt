This mortal flesh will honour no grave
My final rest is not six feet under

Eliminate me from this filthy surface
The haven for the act of betray
Only in flames I can be
Released from the earthly decay

I demand a complete destructionÂ 
Leaving just nothing but ashes behind

Burn me like the kings
Purify my flesh
The flames will set me free
Burn me

Erase every trace of me
And send me away from thee

No tomb shall bear my name
As one of the fallen Â Â 
I will not rot in your soil
My blood must boil

Cleanse this body of mine
Filled with sin and disease
Feed the flame with my remains
Scatter the ashesÂ 

Burn me like the kings
Purify my flesh
The flames will set me free
Burn me
Purify my flesh
And bring me to the pyre
Burn me like the kings
Purify my flesh
The flames will set me free
Burn me
Purify my flesh
And burn me
Burn me like the kings
