With killing steps we walk the earth
A march towards the dying sun
Behind us rise the lifeless shadow
Destruction is the art of man
The wrath within feeds our lust for blood
On killing fields we slay the weak
Corpse after corpse in endless lines
Inferno brought upon ourselves

Humanity dethronedÂ 
End time divine
Once, and for all
The prophecies unfold

As man has created all of the gods
Man will create the apocalypse
By constantly raping the soilÂ 
The final conflict will arise
A dilemma not solved with intelligence
Nor with some divine gift from above
Yet with our instinctive reaction
Human blood will be shed

Blood will be shed

The bonds and fetters severed
A liberation of beasts
With flames dancing in eyes
No one reprievedÂ 
With killing steps we walk the earth
A march towards the dying sun
Behind us rise the lifeless shadow
Destruction is the art of man

Humanity dethronedÂ 
End time divine
Once, and for all
The prophecies unfold

The bonds and fetters severed
A liberation of beasts
With flames dancing in eyes
No one reprievedÂ
