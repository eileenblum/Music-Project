The raging horde of the blind
Enthralled by the rhetoric of hate
Seduced by poisonous whispers
And the lying words of snakes
We embrace again the concept of blind obedience
An escape from the agony of existence

"Oh Master. Grant us Thy order.
Whip us and we shall kiss Thy hand"

As one we are united under the flag of hatred
We will march...
We are predestined to kill
The scent of blood ignites us
To deeds beyond compare

Consume your will and conscience
The eyes that nail you to the wall
Commands you to obey
And obey you shall
Leading your soul to blood stained glory

"Idealise brute force
Kneel before the icons
The inborn illusion prevails
Manifest the ability
To be the rightful guardians
And progenies of gods"

Renounce your will

The raging horde of the blind
Enthralled by the rhetoric of hate
Seduced by poisonous whispers
And the lying words of snakes
We embrace again the concept of blind obedience
An escape from the agony of existence

Consume your will and conscience
The eyes that nail you to the wall
Commands you to obey
And obey you shall
Leading your soul to blood stained glory

Consume your will and your conscience
The eyes that nail you to the wall
Commands you to obey
And obey you shall
