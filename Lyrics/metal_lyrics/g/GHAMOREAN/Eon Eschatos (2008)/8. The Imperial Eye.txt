"Sons of puritan blood
Defend our supremacy
Hunt for the unbelievers"

The massive war cult
Enslaves the weak
Humans turned to shells
In line against the evil

Christian death machine
Zealots of the new millennia
In war with humanity
Leading dogma onto fields of glory

Counter insurgency
With them or against them
All heretics must die
To fulfill their mission to civilize
And cleanse the world from filth
A new cross on the roaring panzers
And fire in their eyes
Revenge through bloodshed

The modern triumphant crusade
Crushing remains of the adversaries
Massmurder in the name of the lord
Hail the star spangled banner

Burning the enemies
And creating a kingdom
Upon the ashes left
Reeking with the smell of death

Christian death machine
Zealots of the new millennia
In war with humanity
Leading dogma onto fields of glory
