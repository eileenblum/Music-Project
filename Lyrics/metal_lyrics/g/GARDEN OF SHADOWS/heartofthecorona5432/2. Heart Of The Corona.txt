Echoes of the future have filtered through time. 
There will be no light... Ablaze within the divine spectrum. 
Remnants of an enchanted past have fallen. 
The swollen tides of conviction engender desolation. 
Crying into deaf ears as a voluminous portent is sifted swiftly into dust. Its particles woven into an ominous tapestry. 
Overcast upon our blindness playing the instruments of betrayal. 
Heedless of deception. 
Sparks ignite kindling dormant embers giving way 
to the fire of comprehension the torch shall be passed on. 
Limitless are the horizons that beckon us. 
Upon the path of resplendence as rainbows are 
released from the prisms keeping the heart of the Corona. 
Beating until the end of time.
