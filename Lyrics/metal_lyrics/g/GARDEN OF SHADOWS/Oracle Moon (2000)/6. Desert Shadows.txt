Within two worlds
Wind carries the sand
Of a desert of emotions
Unto tear stained cheeks
Skin seared by the power 
Of oblivious stars
He cries... shedding tears... though none are left
They cry... golden tears... diamonds glistening
Solace found underneath a palm 
Brushing the burning void away
The jewels of their emotions
Are left abandoned in the sand
As they face one another
In a dimensional confrontation
Twin images etched in glass
And the backdrop of the cosmos
The stars disregard
His pain laid flat 
Against the pane
He cries... shedding tears... though none are left
They cry... golden tears... vagabonds in the sand
The scream echoes silent
Within a world forever deaf
He sees within the other
Reality's reflection surreal
And as the bright stars arch
The power of the palm grows
Extinguishing his silent partner
And his phantom world
In contrary motion
He raises his frame
As the other falls...
Shattering upon the barren earth's kiss
Like a thousand sapphires
Reflecting the light of the stars
Flung against the night's canopy
And his end becomes clear 
In rippling pools of a desert oasis...
Transcend the line drawn in the sand
By the remnants of his twin
Orphan the sanctity of the palm
And eschew the safety of its shadow
