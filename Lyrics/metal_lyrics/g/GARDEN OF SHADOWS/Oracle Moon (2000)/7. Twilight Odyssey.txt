We traveled towards land unknown
Upon the winding path of fate
Uncertainty, our companion
Understanding, our destination
We looked above to the heavens 
While fire blazed across the sky
And seared it a brilliant crimson
That quickly faded to gray...
Enchanted mist rained down upon us
Clouding the path with haze
Vertigo sensation rising within
As we hopelessly cling to vespers 
And begin to slip away... 
Into a vortex of undefined shapes
Trying to grasp
Some shred of reality
A futile endeavor
In this dreamlike world
Infinity's child surrounds
Where the golden chimeras fly
As a phantasmagoria unfolds before our eyes
As we yield to our invigorated senses
The existence we once knew falls away
And we spread our wings for the first time
With unparalleled abandon 
We drink in the rich beauty
That lies in the forgotten wisdom
Of this unearthly realm...
It flows into us
As we bathe in the twilight glow
And the secrets of the universe 
Are bestowed upon us
In a celestial coronation
As we rotate as one
In harmony with the spheres...
