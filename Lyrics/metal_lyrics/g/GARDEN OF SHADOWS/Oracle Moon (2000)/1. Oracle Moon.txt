An eye glances skyward
The gaze one with the heavens
Entrapped by the cold celestial eye
And their distance is transcended
"What events have you witnessed? 
What epic movements have been
Conducted before your unyielding stare?"
"Gaia has eternally enchanted me
With her vibrant enigmas
I tug at her liquid heart
But resolutely mute she remains"
"Oracle Moon
Allow me to bathe in your porous honesty
And absorb millennia"
The barren power
(Humored by the supplication)
Grants the wish
The enthrallment for the communion granted
The idle satellite takes the stage
And commences its vesperian soliloquy
As it enraptures its prey
"I have been witness,
The sole audience for the round theater
Wrapped in white gauze and bathed in blue
Within each rock on this tired body
Is embedded a concept
In each pebble, a thought
The ages of wisdom have poured into each crevice
As the language of the cosmos expresses itself through me
Gaia has eternally enchanted me
With her vibrant enigmas
I tug at her liquid heart
But resolutely mute she remains"
"Oracle Moon,
Allow me to dive within your worn divisions
And gather sempiternity..."
"Deny yourself the temptation 
To decipher the common tongue
My invitation would only baffle
For my coarse veracity lies beyond your grasp"
