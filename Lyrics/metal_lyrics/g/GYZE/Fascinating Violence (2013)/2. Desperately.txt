I waited for this time now,
But it was different

I don't understand a correct,
Answer and me

I will be freed from a hesitation
I changed feeling advance

I end it xxxx now
I want to watch an end

I abandon a past to win
I turn on spirit

I will be freed from a hesitation
I changed feeling advance 

I live desperately
To the change mind
There for now
My hope were destroyed
Till when to I live
Nothing is real
I can't move back
It's different true
I hate so much. Too late
Cause I
Screaming
