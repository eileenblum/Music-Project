I say to me
I know I hope end
Heart seems to burn
Can't stop can't back
I'm crabby now
Window and sea.
They hide your face
I just lied
I hit. I tell me die

All my thing are gone
My hope were destroyed
You gave me that when I killed 
Therefore
Just called "so much pain"
Acid rain fall on me
Go in the fog
Everybody go Milan

Last hope
Last days
I can't move back

Lost time
Lost eyes
It's difficult to look

Last chance
Last accept
All my thing are gone

Lost voice
Lost mind
But my life goes on
