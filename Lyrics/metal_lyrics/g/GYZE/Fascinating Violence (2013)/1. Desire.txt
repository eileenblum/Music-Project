Silent night, you leave no choice
You went out without saying a word
I don't know what to do
I can't stand and forget

I've thought about you since then
But I don't know what you want to do
I have screamed until I've lost my voice
If the pain goes on I'll die

Why was I born?
(Would you tell me?)
Was I born to die?
(Was I born to love?)

God knows why I was born

No matter what I said
(You never smiled)
I didn't know what to do

The pain disappeared
As time went by
But you are not here yet
I can't turn back now 

The pain disappeared
As time went by
But you are not here yet
I can't turn back now

The pain disappeared
As time went by
But you are not here yet
I can't turn back now

The pain
Desire

Why was I born?
(Would you tell me?)
Was I born to die?
(Was I born to love?)
