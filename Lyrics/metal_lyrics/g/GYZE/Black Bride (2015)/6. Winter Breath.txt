WHAT DID YOU SAY? / I AM INNOCENT
YOU NEVER OPEN YOUR EYES / I FEEL NOHING
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE / MY BREATH IS OVER
YOUR EYES SEEM FROZEN

BUT YOU GOT A HOPE / IS IT REAL?
I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE / MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT
YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD / JUST AS THOUGHT
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU

MY BODY BECOMES COLD / ALL IS WINTER
YOU NEVER OPEN YOUR EYES / FLOWING IN THE NOONLIGHT
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE / STOPPED HEART BEAT
FOLLOW THE WINTER BREATH

I CONTINUE TO WALK
IN THE SNOWFIELD
I'M SO TIRED
I WOULD BE WANDERING
I WANNA GRAB SOMETHING
WE GRABBED DESPAIR

LIE OR TRUTH?
TELL ME OF MY LIFE
HEAVEN OR HELL
I WASH MY HANDS
PAST OR PRESENT
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LIFE
FIRE OR ICE
FOLLOW THE WINTER BREATH
