I WALK THIS WAY
THE FLOCK OF DEAD IS AROUND
I BEREAVE OF MY MIND
WAITING EITHER HELL OR HEAVEN

THE WORLD OF THE DEAD
HOPE IS NIL YET
AN ILLUSORY HOPE
TERROR SEIZED ME

I CANNOT DIE, I CANNOT LIVE
I WANT WINGS OF FREEDOM
I CANNOT DIE, I CANNOT CRY
I WILL STRANGLE ME, THE HOUR HAS COME
THE HOUR HAS COME

I SEE FAILED GODDESS
DEATH IS CALLING ME
I'M FEELING AFRAID
DEATH IS CALLING ME

HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I FEEL DEAD
