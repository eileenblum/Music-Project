I'M TIRED OF LIVING
LIBERATION OF MY HEART
I WANT ONLY YOU
BUT THERE IS NOTHING OF YOU HERE
I WISH TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING TONIGHT
BUT YOU ARE NOT HERE
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
TREACHERY IS BEAUTIFUL

I WAS TIRED OF LIVING
LIBERATION OF MY HEART
YOU ARE NOT NECESSARY
MY HEART CANNOT FORGET YOU
I WISH TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING TONIGHT
BUT YOU ARE NOT HERE
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
TREACHERY IS BEAUTIFUL

JUST TELL ME IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME
I'M NOT YOUR MARIONETTE
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE TRUTH?
I WANT TO BREAK ALL
I CANT TRUST YOU

TEARS EXHAUSTED ME, I'M WITHERED
TRUST IS THE WAY TO TREACHERY
FALL VICTIM TO SOMEONE'S TREACHERY
TEARS EXHAUSTED ME, I'M WITHERED
TRUST IS THE WAY TO TREACHERY
YOUR NAME IS BLACK BRIDE

I'M MADE OF JEALOUSY
YOU ARE MADE OF WORRY
THAT'S LIFE, AFTER ALL
THAT'S THE WAY THE MOP FLOPS

TEARS EXHAUSTED ME, I'M WITHERED
TRUST IS THE WAY TO TREACHERY
FALL VICTIM TO SOMEONE'S TREACHERY
TEARS EXHAUSTED ME, I'M WITHERED
TRUST IS THE WAY TO TREACHERY
YOUR NAME IS BLACK BRIDE
