I FORGET
I DO NOT WANT
TO BE A VICTIM
FOR YOU

I KNOW ONE
YOU CAN NOT HAVE HOPE
TIME IS RUNNING
EVERYDAY IN HELL

ONE DAY NIGHT
I REMEMBERED
GNOSIS IS BROKEN
GNOSIS IS BROKEN

I KNOW ONE
YOU CAN NOT HAVE HOPE
TIME IS RUNNING
EVERYDAY IN HELL

IT DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE / LOSE ONE'S MOORINGS
NOTHING LASTS FOREVER / LOSE ONE'S MIND
FALL INTO PROFOUND SLEEP
WHERE HAS GNOSIS GONE?

I HOPE GET GNOSIS AGAIN
STRAY FROM THE RIGHT PATH
BURY ME MY GNOSIS
I REALLY HATE THIS WORLD, LET'S FUCK THIS WORLD
