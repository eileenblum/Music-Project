SKY SHADED FROM BLUE INTO DARKNESS
DREAM TO BE ANYWHERE BUT HERE
CAN YOU HEAR MY VOICE?
TRUTH IS NOBODY KNOWS
I'M FEELING FREE TO LOOK UP AT THE SKY
BUT DISASTER IS ON ITS WAY

I KNOW THAT TIME CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK
SO I DON'T NEED WORDS WHICH MAKE ME CONFUSE

SKY SHADED FROM BLUE INTO DARKNESS
DREAM TO BE ANYWHERE BUT HERE
CAN YOU HEAR MY VOICE?
TRUTH IS NOBODY KNOWS
IM FEELING FREE TO LOOK UP AT THE SKY
BUT DISASTER IS ON ITS WAY

I KNOW THAT TIME CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK
SO I DON'T NEED WORDS WHICH MAKE ME CONFUSE

I WANT TWILIGHT
STAY OUT OF MY LIFE
I SEE SUNSET
I DO NOT HAVE ANY HIGH HOPES
I WANT TWILIGHT
STAY OUT OF MY LIFE
I SEE SKY
I DO NOT HAVE ANY HIGH HOPES
