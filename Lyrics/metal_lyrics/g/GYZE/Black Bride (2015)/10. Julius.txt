TELL ME WHY YOU KILL ME AGAIN
AROUND THE SEA OF BLOOD
BROKEN DREAM, BROKEN HEART
I CANNOT FEEL LIFE, I CANNOT STAY FREE
I WILL STOP! WE GOT DESPAIR

DREAM, HOPE, LOVE
ALL MY EFFORT CAME TO NOTHING
HATE WITH ME
ALL MY EFFORT CAME TO NOTHING

THERE WAS A DREAM IN ME
THERE WAS A LOVE IN ME
THERE IS NO SALVATION
I HOPE AFTER THE WAR

I WAS KILLED AT WAR
AROUND THE FOREST OF DEATH
I CANNOT FEEL PLEASURE, I CANNOT STAY FREE
I WILL SAY! WE GOT DESPAIR
TELL ME WHY YOU KILL ME AGAIN

TELL ME WHY YOU KILL ME AGAIN
AROUND THE SEA OF BLOOD
BROKEN DREAM, BROKEN HEART
I CANNOT FEEL LIFE, I CANNOT STAY FREE
I WILL STOP! WE GOT DESPAIR

DREAM, HOPE, LOVE
ALL MY EFFORT CAME TO NOTHING
HATE WITH ME
ALL MY EFFORT CAME TO NOTHING

THERE WAS A DREAM IN ME
THERE WAS A LOVE IN ME
THERE IS NO SALVATION
I HOPE AFTER THE WAR

TELL ME WHY I DIED
AROUND THE REAPER
MAKING A DREAM, MAKING A HEART
ICAN FEEL LIFE, I CAN STAY FREE!
I WILL GO! WE GO TO HEAVEN

DREAM, HOPE, LOVE
ALL MY EFFORT CAME TO NOTHING
HATE WITH ME
ALL MY EFFORT CAME TO NOTHING

THERE WAS A DREAM IN ME
THERE WAS A LOVE IN ME
THERE IS NO SALVATION
I HOPE AFTER THE WAR
