Just one drink to get through the day.
Itâs getting darker and harder to stay in this place.
Where the flowers arenât blooming.
Iâm touch and go. Can you relate?
Medicate before this session. Iâll be late.
And Iâm constantly fearing the plot that Iâll take.

Why do I need all these bottle dry?
I donât want this.

The feeling of drowning in air. (Iâm dry)
Enjoy the rain while you can. (Iâm dry)
Thereâll be no water in hell. (Iâm dry)
Enjoy the rain while you can.
And Iâm constantly fearing the plot that Iâll take.

Why do I need all these bottle dry?
I donât want.

Iâm gonna try.
Control desires.

Swim up. (swim up, swim up)
I need a little air.
I canât breathe.
I need a better balance.
