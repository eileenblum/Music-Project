Take a look into these eyes and tell me what you see.
I built your trust just like this world.
Hopefully it wonât end badly.
Take these whispers in your ear and tell me what you hear.
Crashing the world brick by brick.
Told you all it would end badly.

I would like to build this world around you.
And I would like to crush this world around you.

Donât you forget that there were ways around the mess that I had made.
Take it in stride cause you are all I need.

I would like to build this world around you.
And I would like to crush this world around you.

Let me in, let me in, let me in baby.
Let me in, let me in, let me in oh honey.

Honey I built all these things for you.
Honey what do I have left to prove?

Beyond the moon, beyond the stars is a place inside my heart.
I built all these things for you.
Something no mortal could ever do.
Take what Iâve given and try to leave.
Take what Iâve given and try to leave.

I would like to build this world around you.
And I would like to crush this world around you.

Around you.
