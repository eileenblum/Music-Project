Chip away the glass, it separates whatâs real.
With all these fragments Iâll build you.
Maybe we could show each other glass can bend.
I must break you.
Maybe we can start to rebuild when Iâm through.
Youâll love this.

Are you a Scorpio? I would like to know, cause I think I might like this.
Am I your Romeo? Please donât kill me yet, cause I think that youâre still wet.

Fuck it!

Shattered I canât feel or separate whatâs real.
Holding on to a memory of making what you loved.
Nothing is what it seems.
I must break you.
Maybe we can start to rebuild when Iâm through.
Youâll love this.

Are you a Scorpio? I would like to know, cause I think I might like this.
Am I your Romeo? Please donât kill me yet, cause I think that youâre still wet.

Could I ever be part of your consideration baby?
Take into account we grew apart in heaven.
Never thought Iâd be part of your consideration baby.
Take into account we grew apart in heaven.

Am I your Romeo?
