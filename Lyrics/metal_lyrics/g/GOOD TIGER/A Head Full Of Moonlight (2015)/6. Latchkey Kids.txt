Let me help you choose.
Donât live with your ghosts.
Youâve been rolling the rice for too long,
And the hand you want, the hand you need, youâll never get.

Bit into the sky. It filled our heads with moonlight.
Almost too vivid to see where we were, what could have been.
Bit into the sky. It filled our heads with moonlight.
Almost too vivid to see where we were, what could have been.

There is little time. Donât waste it on god.

Dive in. Trust in your presence.
The worth you seek, the worth you need, youâll achieve.

Bit into the sky. It filled our heads with moonlight.
Almost too vivid to see where we were, what could have been.
Bit into the sky. It filled our heads with moonlight.
Almost too vivid to see where we were, what could have been.

Speak for a reason.
Sink in your empathy.
