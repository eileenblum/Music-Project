Birds look above ahead of time.
Weâve been marked as a threat.
Thereâs no logic for my trial.
Will I see some rest?

If I never walk again, all thatâs occurred so worthless.
The way weâve seen these words so distant.
Lost sense in what control our tongues.

Do they know my name?

Oh me oh my, this mess of mine.
Need to own my regret.
I have begged the fairer kind to help make my bed.

If I never walk again, all thatâs occurred so worthless.
The way weâve seen these words so distant.
Lost sense in what control our tongues.

Do they know my name?
