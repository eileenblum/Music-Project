Just one kiss is enough to get me drunk right from your lips.
I would swim through the deepest oceans just to hear your name.
(I would, I would, I would)
I thought I knew right from wrong.
But the blood upon these hands has proved me wrong.
My mistakes canât be covered up.
You should cover up,
Wonât you cover up?

Just hold on and dance like thereâs no tomorrow.
Letâs hold on cause without you there is no me.

I would run through the darkest forest just to taste your skin.
Melt the sun if for just one second I could stop the pain.
(I would, I would, I would)
I thought I knew right from wrong.
But the blood upon these hands has proved me wrong.
My mistakes canât be covered up.
You should cover up,
Wonât you cover up?

Just hold on and dance like thereâs no tomorrow.
Letâs hold on cause without you there is no me.

You seem to think youâre bound and gagged and here all just for me.
You can leave, what could I do.

I thought I learned right from wrong.

Just hold on and dance like thereâs no tomorrow.
Letâs hold on cause without you there is no me.
