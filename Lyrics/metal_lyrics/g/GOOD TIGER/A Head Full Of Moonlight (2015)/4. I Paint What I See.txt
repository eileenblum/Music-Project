Red is the color of love.
Blue is the color of my waning. My waning.
Yellow is envy. Maybe itâs green?
Somewhere there lies a color in between.
You know where my pallet lies.
Brushes complete the rain.
Oils come together to remember my name.

I cannot believe the colors you are seeing. (Whoa, whoa)
It takes a certain kind of mind to lead me away.
I wonder if I could be swayed?
Maybe all you got to do is paint the canvas gray.

I paint what I see with reckless abandonment.
Self-portraits reflect me reflecting.
If I could mix all these paints, color would show emotional state.
Well sometimes take a step back just to see what you create.

I cannot believe the colors you are seeing. (Whoa, whoa)
It takes a certain kind of mind to lead me away.
I wonder if I could be swayed?
Maybe all you got to do is paint the canvas gray.

Sketch the stress of daily living.
Paint the life of someone else.

Red. Red. Red. Red.
