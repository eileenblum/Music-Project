This is it: the only city Iâve walked in.
Stay close to me, we wonât bow heads for anybody.

If they stop moving it will kill them. I can fly forever.
This desertâs lost its charm. Iâve had my fill of scales and leather.
If they stop moving it will kill them but I can fly forever.

The desertâs lost its charm.
I can fly forever.

Old people in old buildings.
Theyâre moving away.
Old people in old buildings.
Theyâre moving away.

Have some dignity you fucking cunt!

Weâve grown strong bones.
We have strong iron.
Theyâve been messing with my town.
And I am not afraid.
Stop fucking with my town.
Letâs ditch the car and go running.

If they stop moving it will kill them. I can fly forever.
This desertâs lost its charm. Iâve had my fill of scales and leather.
If they stop moving it will kill them but I can fly forever.

The desertâs lost its charm.
The desertâs lost its charm.

This is the only city Iâve ever watched.
