[Vinyl Reissue Bonus Track]Sixty winters and six long past,
Carved my path into the stones,
Weathered lines familiar to my touch,
I know them deep within my bones,
I have stood here so many times before,
tracing lines with aging hands,
All thatâs left is desire for reclamation,
Or the ability to forget

Once more for the days long past
Heads bowed for the oneâs weâve lost
[2x]

I remember the breath of desolation
Sighing through the battlefield
with age came the heavy price of slaughter
I traded innocence for steel

Celtic steel!

Seen in fragments, memories of the days
When all was simple, all was clear
When I was young the world was filled with wonder
No sorrow, no hate or fear
So as I lay my hand upon the stone
I think of all those Iâve lost
The lives Iâve stolen, the lives forever gone
the cost of battles lost or won

We will never reclaim
Those gilded days of old
But our fates are our own to weave
No destiny
No distant god

Once more for the days long past
Heads bowed for the oneâs weâve lost
[2x]

I have reached the end
Only my deeds live on
