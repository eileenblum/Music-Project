I remember sunlight dancing across her face
Patterns in my mind gently etched in gold and amber
The warmth of summer riding sweetly on her breath
A warmth recalled only in memories of halcyon yesterdays

Now summer has ended and the warmth is gone
Nothing but a braid on the gallows tree remains to mark her passing
In autumn's wake, sorrow took her as its own
My heart was buried with her there beneath the bleeding oak

She died alone in that mournful glade
No comfort sought nor gained in hateful solitude
She flew on wings as black as seething night
Oh where was I, thou blighted, cursed wood?

Gold and ochre
Behold the tapestry of the fall
There is a beauty
A certain subtle grandeur
In the withering that consumes us all

Among the sightless trunks and boughs
Bare feet upon forgotten soil paths
The leaves blind to her desperate plight

Yet ravens watched from every branch
And witnessed mute her final fall
With solemn caws they called her dead
And flew into the granite sky

Time fades away yet sorrow remains

And as her final song she sang:
'I will fade as night conquers day
I am the ashen Eidolon, the deepest shade of grey'

She shuddered with the flaming leaves
Her veins spat golden gouts of burning life
That swirled upward against the pouring rain
Which came down hard as iron coffin nails
It splintered wooden limbs and shattered stone
And pounded on her lifeless, paling corpse
It gave her leave of what she could no longer bear
And forged for her a gilded tomb

Gold and ochre
Behold the tapestry of the fall
There is a beauty
A certain subtle grandeur
In the withering that consumes us all
