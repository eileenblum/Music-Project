Lit with the flash of lightning
The mother of solitude and poets
Always in black, gowned in dignity
Peaceful, calm but still dangerous

Haunt me
Hug me
Wrap me in the scraf woven of silver stars

Haunt me
Hug me
You alone can soothe me

Looking for the night
I submit my request to the time
That I could meet with Her now

Looking for the night
I submit my request to the time
But He sentences me to waiting the whole day

Sentenced to slumber I nestle in Her arms
Though I ponder upon Her during the day
Her black heart beats at midnight
Gaining strength, the lullaby's content

In darkness I can see more
Wander in the corners of dreams
Look for the inspiration among the stars
Before the day breaks

Looking for the night
I submit my request to the time
That I could meet with Her now

Looking for the night
I submit my request to the time
But He sentences me to waiting the whole day

Looking for the night
