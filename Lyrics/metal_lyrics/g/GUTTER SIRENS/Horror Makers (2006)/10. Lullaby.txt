(Nestle me before I pass away)

Lie down
The great giant
Quietly go to sleep

Your troubles, problems and complaints will disappear
You'll relieve your pain for a while

Look how stars twinkle
In the garden cicadas begin their song
Stop your fight for you desire the dream

Though it's still summer, autumn is in the air
Now go to sleep
Close your eyes, forget for a while
You really don't have to be afraid

Faith, hope and what is lost
Still trouble your mind
Sleep now for tomorrow will be a new day

Just like the wind you'll fight the windmills
Which believe in nothing; they're indifferent
Just like the wind you'll float among us
The swish of hair, three salty teardrops

So close your eyes, for one can tell
You deadly need to sleep
The sky is filled with stars, and the moon is new
This night will give you the rest

Look how stars twinkle
In the garden cicadas begin their song
Stop your fight for you desire the dream

Just like the wind you'll fight the windmills
Which believe in nothing; they're indifferent
Just like the wind you'll float among us
The swish of hair, three salty teardrops
