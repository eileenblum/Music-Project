Great load of your eyes
The face of stone, your face
No motivation to action
No dimension when you can find yourself

Filled with doubts burn your time
Pain which does not hurt
Don't be afraid, the next day is coming

New horizons are opened
They long for your faith in the next life
Learn how to handle depression

New horizons are opened
To next nights, next days
And the faith in the everlasting goodness

The butt, the empty glass
In your mouth the bitter taste
Tell me if you know the taste of defeat
If you fill yourself with the bitterness

Filled with doubts burn your time
Pain which does not hurt
Don't be afraid, the next day is coming

New horizons are opened
They long for your faith in the next life
Learn how to handle depression

New horizons are opened
To next nights, next days
And the faith in the everlasting goodness

New horizons are opened
They long for your faith in the next life
Learn how to handle depression
