When you get a gift cherish it with your look
Warm touch, the joy of the moment, the spark in your eye

When you forgive something, even million of faults
You are the candle's light, the warrior without a weapon

Look, the day is dying, closing your eyelids
You are free, forget about what the cry means
Look, the day is dying, wandering in forgetfulness
But the core remains in the light of stars

Though sometimes you know you are an alien
A silent rebel without courage
With no faith in the future, careless
Your being human is your precious thing

When somebody is leaving you bid him with your eyes
Cold pain in your heart, hope or fear
When somebody takes away what's valuable
You lose everything losing hope

Look, the day is dying, closing your eyelids
You are free, forget about what the cry means
Look, the day is dying, wandering in forgetfulness
But the core remains in the light of stars

Though sometimes you know you are an alien
A silent rebel without courage
With no faith in the future, careless
You being human is your precious thing

I'm the killer of your darkness
My power defines new land
