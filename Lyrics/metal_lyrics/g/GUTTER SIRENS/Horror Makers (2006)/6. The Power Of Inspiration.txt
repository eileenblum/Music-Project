On the verge of the thorn you look for the answers
In the labyrinth of questions who has the seventh key
Who was carried by the sounds of the layer of the stratosphere
On the day of solar eclipses the rituals of the seven wounds

Till the end of time - let the sun shine
Till the end of time - let music play
Till the end of time - let smile rule
Till the end of time - let flourish happiness

The cast of the die, points at last new goal
White beard guard on the icy land
Karma is my mission, I want to pass it
To the next generations, large cleft key

Till the end of time - let the sun shine
Till the end of time - let music play
Till the end of time - let smile rule
Till the end of time - let flourish happiness

Like white clouds the sounds charm us
We are their slaves
So open your heart to the goodness of music
And it will ease your pain

In the gallery of shadows old spider web
And choral singing, children from the mysterious forest
Final counting coming somewhere from the north
Rhapsody and sonata created by the crimson king

Till the end of time - let the sun shine
Till the end of time - let music play
Till the end of time - let smile rule
Till the end of time - let flourish happiness

Like white clouds the sounds charm us
We are their slaves
So open your heart to the goodness of music
And it will ease your pain

Till the end of time - let the sun shine
Till the end of time - let music play
Till the end of time - let smile rule
Till the end of time - let flourish happiness

Flourish happiness
