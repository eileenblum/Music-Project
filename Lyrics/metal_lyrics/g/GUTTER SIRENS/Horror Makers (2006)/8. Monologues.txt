Silence and calmness are killed each day
Hope and love you change into pathological scream

They live under one roof for a couple of years
But still they are strangers
He drinks too much
She feeds him with hatred, anger and scream

It used to be heavenly
Great plans for the whole life

With monologues their existence
Is now poisoned

Quarrels every day, calling names, mockery
He hides his nose into a newspaper
She complains again to the kitchen walls
That she's been unhappy for years

It used to be heavenly
Great plans for the whole life

With monologues their existence
Is now poisoned

Answer my questions which torture
The soul of mine
Which still remain unanswered

Will their children forgive them
All the tears
Lack of time for them
For the freeze of home

Sing lady your song from the heaven's lips the heat
Say it once again how unhappy you are
You are surrounded by the awful husband
Your long monologues turn him on

By means of your sweet monologues
You shorten his years
