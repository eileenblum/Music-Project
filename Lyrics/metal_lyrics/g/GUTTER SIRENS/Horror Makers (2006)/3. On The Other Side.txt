Filled with the magic power
You wander across the corridors of the past
Visit the places soaked with the mystery

The loud cry of the people of history
Figures imprisoned in the frames of eternity

Observe your movements with jealousy
They envy you the feeing of freedom

Time dealt pack of the cards
Moveless struggle on the other side

As long as the time lasts accompanied by death
Nothing special can occur
Give me your hand and cry if needed
You save yourself from being forgotten

Still wandering you've reached the forest
Observe seemingly motionless trees
But it is not true that imprisoned are the trees

Time does not rule them
(They are not afraid) What'll happen with them on the other side

As long as the time lasts accompanied by death
Nothing special can occur
Give me your hand and cry if needed
You save yourself from being forgotten

On the other side
