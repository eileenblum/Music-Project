In the land of eternal blizzards
In the valley of the whispers of rocks
My thoughts live during the night
They surround me

They whirl in the vortex of dreams here and there
Calmness is the blessing or a punishment
Really I don't know

Despite that mayhem visits my head
Noise, voice, the roar of the beast
Then I think you are my medicine
You will ease the pain I swallow your tears

Take me to the land of magic, baby
Show the different world
The world of joy and forgetfulness
Renew the self - confidence

Sometimes I see you in the world of my dreams
Then you fight with the sword like a knight saving me
On your face there is pain sometimes anger
Those structures are put in the mosaic of ordinary things

Now I know that when you are in my thoughts
No chaos, the roar of the beast (unpleasant moments)
Your cure for my pain you carry with you
Up to the moment it eases the fear I swallow your tear

Take me to the land of magic, baby
Show the different world
The world of joy and forgetfulness
Renew the self - confidence

Faith and hope and what is needed
With the hand of love paint the world
Although everyday we miss unknown moments
We cherish the past days

The past days
