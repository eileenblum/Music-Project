First time when I opened myself to
The criticism of many hearts
I was guided by a goal
To light up every bar

In gloomy days when sometimes it was raining
Although I cried I was ready
To show you again how beautiful is that world

Tell me sincerely if the toy soldier
Although he was deadly afraid deep in his soul
Was a hero or maybe a marionette
Whom he shot and what was his true goal

Tell me sincerely if the toy soldier
Although he has hesitant thoughts is deep in heart
Was a hero or maybe a marionette
Whom he shot and who he was afraid of

The next target, one more ordinary shot
Although I point a gun and I don't aim
Why it is really so hard to hit
An ordinary man.
