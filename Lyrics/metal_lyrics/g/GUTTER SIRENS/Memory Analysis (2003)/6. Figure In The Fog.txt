Now when you're gone our hearts are broken
But what remained is the happiness of knowing you
The immense grief and immense pain
Accompany us every night in vain

In the fog with dignity you left
Only the invisible cry remained
Like a bolt from the blue was your death

My friend I miss you so much thus
But sometimes one feels your presence
So many years you were with us

You left us on a cloudy day
Though you used to brighten days as no one may
Irreplaceable

You are the bird flying in the stars
You are the angel who gave us so much
How difficult to find the lost flower
How difficult to accept he's no longer with us

I truly believe you are there
Where the death defeated and happiness and joy last
I believe you are there
Where peace and love accompany you
