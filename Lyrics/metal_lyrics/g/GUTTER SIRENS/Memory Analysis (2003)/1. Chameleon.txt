Like a flag on the wind
Like a drop among the waves
Unnoticed you melt with a crowd

For the other you are party leader just
On different occasions shed tears
Like a chameleon you adjust

Why man do you still change
You're impersonal only the projection
Why do you repeat words like a parrot
With no objection

You are becoming a chameleon
Only when you dream it is you at last
You accept bad people who hurt you

You sentence yourself
To the loss
Although you think you win
You frozen your ideas and your ego

You destroy in your life what's important
Strong will and beliefs
You prefer to conquer world in your dreams.
