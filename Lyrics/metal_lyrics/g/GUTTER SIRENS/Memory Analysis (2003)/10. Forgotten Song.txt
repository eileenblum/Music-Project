Forgotten sounds from the days of the past
The music scores full of notes as the sky of the stars
Where are they Where is cast
The melody of the past

Now with the music for naive
The whole world is fed
On the other side of the mirror hidden paradise
But you know nothing - not wise

Wajdelot's song sounds like a bell
Harp's tones, the power of harpsichord as well
Where are they Where is cast
The melody of the past

Now with the shit for naive
The whole world is fed
On the other side of the mirror hidden paradise
But you know nothing your empty eyes.
