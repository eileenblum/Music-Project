Who believes in fairy tales
That often a moral avail
The gift of teaching glitters bright
Who believes in witches, trolls and Aladdin's power
Almost nobody enters dimension of no pain

Tears in dragon's eyes invisible ones
Taste bitter for thousand years
Tears in dragon's eyes how many times
How long it will take since you understand the fear of passing

In darkness you may notice that world in which rhythm is pulsing
Merrily harps are playing hundreds times
Medieval hymn

Who has enough courage to ask
Where's this world - what a task
The world of sweets and toys disappeared
Vanished like water bubble fell apart like wrack
Erased from memory as free as a bird.
