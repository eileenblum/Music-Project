I like to live alone, but it's crowded inside sometimes
Look right into a lover's eye. I thought I could fly
but that has been done before. I'm feeling empty.
empty inside. A life I never knew, A room
without a view. My life begins in you.
My life it ends in you. It's like I never never
never never Never been here before
Like to be left alone forever in time, Loved right lived
wrong in another life I thought I could fly but that
has been done before I'm feeling hopeless, hopeless
inside. A life I never knew, A room without a view
My life it ends in you, My life begins in you
It's like I never never never never Never been
here before. It's like a different disease
burning inside of me. It's like a different disease.
Don't deny what's out of your sight. I get drawn
into the light. A life I never knew. A room without a view.
My life it ends in you, My life begins in you
It's like I never never never never Never
been here before
