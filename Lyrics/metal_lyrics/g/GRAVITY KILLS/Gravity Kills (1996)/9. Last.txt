I'd tear my heart out for you, Cross a mountain for you
I'd give myself up for your sin, Open up I'm falling in
What I feel, what I give, take from me what I am
It's the last day of you
I watch the last day of you, A lot has passed I told you
The world surrounding us has gone, The world surrounding us
goes on. What I feel, what I give, take from me what I am
It's the last day of you
Feel my hands upon you, To feel my last touch of you
Feel my breath across your skin, Let go of all you hold within
What I feel, what I give, take from me what I am
It's the last day of you
