I live in the bright light, Walking in the dark
midnight, Skin pale from the street light, Kill time
nothing to do, Inside looking outside, Clawing
at the door shut tight, You can't run and you can't hide
White lies fearing the truth
See ghost in the shadow Living in the past feel cold
While trying to remember Time is stealing my youth
Still trapped on the inside Wearing regret skin tight
Like fire on the outside. All gone nothing in view
Time is nothing when you've nothing to do. Don't you
know you can't hide something When it's living in you
I live in bright light Living in the past shut tight
Skin pale from the street light, White lies stealing my
youth. See ghost in the shadow Clawing at the door midnight
You can't run and you can't hide, All gone fearing the truth
Time is nothing when you've nothing to do Don't you know
you can't hide something When it's living in you
