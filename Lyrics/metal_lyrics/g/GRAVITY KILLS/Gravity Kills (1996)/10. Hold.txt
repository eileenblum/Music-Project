Step into the light, Illuminating you for all to see
Come into my sight. Empty handed not for me. It's in
your hands, my one demand, No one can tell, the sins
I need to sell. I'm still sipping from your well,
Reflecting back to me, Your perfection in my eye
Hurt me, break me, take me.
Your wanting, your watching, your haunting me.
It's in your mind, no one can find
No one can hear, the words I want to fear
I'm still sipping from your well, Reflecting back to me
Your perfection in my eye, Hurt me, break me, take me
It's all of your light, Shadow lifting falling down to me
Becoming your light, Empty, melting all over you.
It's in your hands, my one demand, No one can
tell, the sins I need to sell, I'm still sipping
from your well, Reflecting back to me
Your perfection in my eye
Hurt me break me fuck me
