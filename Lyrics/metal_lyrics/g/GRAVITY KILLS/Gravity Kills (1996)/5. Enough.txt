I love the thrill, I love the scene. Imagine you
in the white light, So beautiful, you watch me bleed
You're stabbing me from inside me now, Kneel down and tell me
about your world, Tell me something that I don't know
You know nothing about the world around you. It's not
enough broken in two, It's not enough speaking the truth
It's not enough watching me bleed, It's not enough
torn in between It's not enough - I'm watching you
distorted view, So beautiful in the white light
It's make believe, all that you see, It's haunting you
from inside now, Kneel down and tell me about your
world, Show me something inside your world, You know
nothing about the world around you - It's not enough
broken in two It's not enough speaking the truth
It's not enough watching me bleed, It's not enough torn in
between, It's not enough - Sometimes in me, you are
the seed, A dying need in the white light.
The simple truth, it speaks to me. It's screaming out
from inside now. Kneel down and tell me about your world
Tell me something that I don't know. You know nothing
about the world around you - It's not enough broken in two,
It's not enough speaking the truth, It's not enough watching
me bleed, It's not enough torn in between
It's not enough broken in two, It's not enough speaking the
truth It's not enough watching me bleed
It's not enough torn in between It's not enough
