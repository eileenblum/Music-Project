I'm your fear, I'm your monster
What's hiding in your shadow? Is it taking what's left of you
Now take me, now lead me from you
Now take me from the light that's dying in your eye
I'm finding out what's left of you, you're burning out
What's left of you? Choking on doubt, you're choking
Way down way down now what's left of you
See no fear, speak no evil
Are you screaming out to no one as you fall down a mountain of pride
I feel you, my eyes wide open
I feel you, do you think you can save yourself in time
I'm finding out what's left of you, you're burning out
What's left of you? Choking on doubt, you're choking
Way down way down now what's left of you
What you see, what tears into you
Behind the wheel that leads you, are you facing a truth that
Won't die? Now take me, now lead me from you
Now take me from the light that's dying in your eye
I'm finding out what's left of you, I'm finding out what's left of you
You're burning out what's left of you, you're king of doubt,
You're choking, way down, way down now, what's left of you
What's left of you, you're burning out, what's left of you
Choking on doubt, you're choking
Way down, way down now, what's left of you
