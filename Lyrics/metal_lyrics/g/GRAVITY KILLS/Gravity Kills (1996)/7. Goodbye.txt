In a mirror of you, reflections of you, you're showing what you
Feel like inside, Need the power of two, just me and you
An image that you hold in your mind. Sometimes you're
wrong and then sometimes you're right, You don't expect me
to put up a fight. I'm sick and tired of all of your lies
I'm sick and tired and I'm saying goodbye.
I don't need this poison, I don't need control, I don't need forgiveness
I don't need you - You're a shadow of me
what I used to be. I'm fading as the light dims
outside, I know what you need, because I can
see I'm taking over thoughts in your mind. Sometimes
you're wrong and then sometimes you're right, You're in
the dark so I'll turn on the light. I'm sick and tired
of all your lies. I'm fucking tired and I'm saying goodbye
I don't need this poison, I don't need control
I don't need forgiveness, I don't need you
I don't need this poison, I don't need control
I don't need forgiveness, I don't need you
