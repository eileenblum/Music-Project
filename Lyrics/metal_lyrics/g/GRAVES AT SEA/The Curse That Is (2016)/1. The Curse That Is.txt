We aren't chosen, we are born
Get off your knees, take what is yours
An inheritance / Cast away
Genesis of original sin
Darkness masks / Innocence
The plague expands / Transforms my mind
Visions of hope / Vanquished to nothing
Living life / Do nothing more
Breath the air shoved in my lungs
Force fed gift / Feeding this life
A parasite / Made to consume
Giving life / Feed the disease
The licking of wounds / Cleanses nothing
The rotting of flesh / Decomposition
Eat of my body / Drink of my blood
Take from my soul / Blacken my heart
Raise all your glasses, we're doomed from the start
Remnants forgotten / Seed of misery
Consumed and defiled / Unsung legacy
Exiting life...
Existence tarnished our souls
One last sip to quench the thirst
A piece of silver under the tongue
Offering up the breaking of bread
Extinction is here, bring out the dead
Eat of my body, drink of my blood
Take from my soul, blacken my heart
Raise all your glasses, we're doomed from the start
