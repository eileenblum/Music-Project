[performed by Graves at Sea]bless me father for i have sinned.
first and foremost for giving in.
what i have come to understand
misfortune came by my own hand.

do as i say, not as i've done.
what i've become must be undone.
all the loss that i've endured.
faither is a sickness and i am cured.

so many promises fallen through.
my hatred grew every day for you.
a thousand drugs for a thousand highs
about which i told a thousand lies.
the cursed thoughts within my head.
the cursed things that i have said.
of all the ways to behave like scum
all the temptations to which i've succumb.

forgive me mother for i  have sinned.
i can't decide where to begin.
the boy you riased is now a ghost.
you've been the one i've hurt the most.
the sleepless nights full of concern.
knowing now trust is something earned.
disappointing in every way.
a new excuse every single day.
despite the chances that i have had.
i'm a worthless son and a worthless dad.
a careless lover to all i've fucked.
and to all my bastards i wish the best of luck.

for all i've borrowed and all i've stole
please have mercy upon my soul.
i know this apology isn't much.
i know i curse everything i touch.

treating life just like a gam.
every scar on my arm, another badge of shame.
how the years seem to fly by
walking this crooked line til the day i die...
