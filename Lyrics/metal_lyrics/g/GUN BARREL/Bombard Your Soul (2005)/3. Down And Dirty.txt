I'm on my way downtown
To a place called "house of dreams"
That's were we meet up every Friday night
At the 42nd street
Ya electrify the room
With your rock bitch attitude
I love the way you make all dicks around you
So confused - yeah

Turn the heat on - baby
I can feel your body's craving me
Let's do some body talk
And I'll give you every inch you need

Tonight's the night
Let's go down and dirty
Do it again like we've done before
I love it when you're going
Down and get dirty
That's why I'm always
Coming back - coming back
I'm coming back for more

You make me going crazy
I'm hungry for your touch
I'm addicted to your love
Now I can't - I can't get enough
You've got the sweetest poison
Ever pumping through my veins
You leave me with no other choice
Need the taste - time and time again

Turn me on and kick my head
You're driving me insane
Pour some sugar on me
Do it - do it once again
Tonight's the night
Let's go down and dirty
Do it again like we've done before
I love it when you're going
Down and get dirty
That's while I'm always
Coming back - I'm coming back
Coming back for more

Uh - do it exactly this way baby
I love it - when you're going
Down - down - down and dirty...

Let us go - going wild
Babe it feels so right
Let us do it once again
My princess of the night
On the bed - on the floor
Is what I'll never wanna miss
Love it anywhere
No one better does exist

Tonight's the night
Let's go down and dirty
Do it again like we've done before
I love it when you're going
Down and get dirty
That's while I'm always
Coming back for more

Tonight's the night
Let's go down and dirty
Do it again like we've done before
I love it when you're going
Down and get dirty
That's while I'm always
Coming back - coming back
I'm coming back - coming back for more...
See you again next Friday baby
