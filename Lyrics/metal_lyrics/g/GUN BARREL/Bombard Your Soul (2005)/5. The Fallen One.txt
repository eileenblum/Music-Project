I hate the way how you analyse a man by his look you fucker
Criticise what your blinded eyes could never see - my real me
You bet me that I'm on my way and that I'm going down
So many suckers did before you - but I'm still around
I give a fuck - don't wanna exist in your reality - just let me be

Nobody brings me down - down - down
Look - the madman's still around

When you see me coming
I am almost gone
Free like the wind
I'm the fallen one
Live life through the fullest
Until my last day's done
Always gonna be
The fallen one

Stay the fuck out of my face
You won't understand me anyway
I'm how I am - and I'm proud to be - can't you see
Man it's a fact - better a freak than living on my knees
Won't change myself into something I don't wanna be
Life's a bad game - it's made for you
You've got to play it well - but without me

As long as this world keeps turning round and round
No one takes away my inner crown

When you see me coming
I am almost gone
Free like the wind
I'm the fallen one
Live life through the fullest
Until my last day's done
Always gonna be
The fallen one

When you see me coming
I am almost gone
Free like the wind
I'm the fallen one
Live life through the fullest
Until my last day's done
Always gonna be the fallen one

When you see me coming
I am almost gone
Free like the wind
I'm the fallen one

Hmhmmm
Yeahiyeaha - that's right

The fallen - the fallen - the fallen
I'm the fallen one
The fallen - the fallen - the fallen
I'm the fallen one
