What are you waiting for
You won't get a second try
This is your only chance
Don't back down - no need to hide

What are you angry with
Like someone's sitting on your back
You gotta move ahead
Reach out for a higher step

Your new tomorrow's starting here today
You've got no time to waste

So come on - come on and
Dive - dive into the flame
What are you waiting for
Dive - dive into the flame
Dive - dive into the flame
This is your only chance
Dive - dive into the flame
Dive into the flame

You've lost so many times
Maybe you think that life's a lie?
Man, I agree with you
The game ain't over 'til the day you die

Now that you've come so far
You're on the point of no return
No never give it up
As long as the fire will burn

No shit - you've got to make it your own way
It's near - the day you'll win again
You gotta win again

D-d-d-d-d-d - dive
Dive into the flame
You've burned your fingers now
Dive - dive into the flame
Dive - dive into the flame
Let's do it right now
Dive - dive into the flame

Dive - dive into the flame
Dive - dive into the flame
Dive - dive into the flame
You've burned your fingers now
Dive - dive into the flame
Let's do it right now
Dive - dive into the flame
Come on - come on - come on and
Dive - dive into the flame
Dive into the flame

So come on and dive
Come on and dive
D-d-d-dive
Dive into the flame
