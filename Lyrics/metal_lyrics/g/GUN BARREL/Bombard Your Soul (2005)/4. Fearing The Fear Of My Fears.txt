Will I wake up tomorrow
Or get lost in this endless sorrow
My enemy without a face
Won't let me out of this place

Caught up in myself
Like there's nothing else
Inside a dark black cloud
That's bleeding me out
Faceless eyes is all I see
Hearing words but without sound
Torture without grace
Tumbling around
Nothing's real or sacred
Rotten deep inside
Locked up in myself
There's no place to hide

It's getting cold
When the shadows are drawing near
Paralysed like a frozen tear
I'm buried alive
In this psychotic mind
I'm gonna dive

Fearing the fear of my fears
Chaining my soul
Deep in that whole
Where no end is near
There's no escape
From fearing the fear of my fears

I can't breath - skin burns
Cold sweat's running down my spine
Something's getting near
But I can't see no single sign
Darkness all around me
Footsteps on my back
A cold hand seems to touch me
Am I playing my last deck?
More than just a nightmare
A never ending fall
Begging for awakening
But no one hears my silent call

I am cold now that the shadows' here
Paralyzed like a frozen tear
I'm buried alive
In this psychotic mind
I'm gonna dive

Fearing the fear of my fears
Chaining my soul
Deep in that hole
Where no end is near
There's no escape
From fearing the fear of my fears

Fearing the fear of my fears
Chaining my soul
Deep in that hole
Where no end is near
There's no escape
From fearing the fear of my...
Fearing the fear of my fears
Chaining my soul
Deep in that hole
Where no end is near
There's no escape
From fearing the fear of my fears

The fear of my fears
