Travelling around
All these unknown places
To rock the night
And living - living our dream
With you - the crowd
So many faces
To bang your heads
For hearing you scream
To say goodbye to all I love
And say "hallo" to all our friends
Who still believe in music
From now on - until the end

Feels so - good to - be back
On the road again
For all my - my life I - I need it
On the road again

I've got no place to call my own
Wherever I go feels like home
Living just for the moment
Living just for the show
Going back on the highway
Of rock'n'roll

Feels so - good to - be back
On the road again
For all my - my life I - I need it
On the road again

Oh yeah-yeaha

Feels so - good to - be back
On the road again
For all my - my life I - I need it
On the road again
Feels so - good to - be back
On the road again
For all my - my life I and
I'll be back on the road

I'll be back on the road
Back on the highway
I'll be back
On the road again
Feels so good to be back
For all my life I need it
On the road again
