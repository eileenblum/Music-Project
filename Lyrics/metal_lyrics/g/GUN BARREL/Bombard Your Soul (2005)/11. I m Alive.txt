A bunch of sorrows
Broken inside
Too many fuckin' drugs
Blew up my mind
Now I've made a change
I've let the table turn
Kick myself back into life
And let old bridges burn

I've opened up another door
And what I've found
Feels so much better than before

I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive
I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive

A life without mistakes
For me impossible to do
I'm not that perfect guy
A little different I know
Human being madman
Living just to rock
And before I'm not those six feet under
I won't make a stop

Never again back on my knees
My time has come - I'm running free

I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive
I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive

Uhouhohouo
Hmmm - I'm alive
Uhouhohouo
And I will survive

There's one thing same for you and I
We both won't get a 2nd life

I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive
I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive
I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive
I'm alive - I'm alive - I'm alive
And I will survive
