Here comes the clown - fooling around
The man with the perfect facade.
Behind your mask - somehow grotesque
A snake in the grass - a brown nose fake

For you love and life is just a big game
Where in the end the winner takes it all
But it's different my friend
It's a give and take
But giving is a thing you'll never know

You're full of hot air
Nothing's for real what you say or do
You're ordinary - so bizarre
Letting your money talk
Uh - it's meaning all to you
Who do you think that you are

Bloody pretender
You're all I hate
Bloody pretender
Now I'm seeing through your masquerade

I guarantee - that you're going down that way
Too late to see - nothing left to change

You're full of hot air
Nothing's for real what you say or do
You're ordinary - so bizarre
Letting your money talk
Uh - it's meaning all to you
Who do you think that you are
Enough is enough
Man you're not worth a dime
Don't need a knife in my back
I don't wanna be a part of your game
You fucking egomaniac

Bootlicker - pretending to be
Bootlicker - don't try to suck up on me

Bloody pretender
You're all I hate
Bloody pretender
Now I'm seeing through your masquerade
Bloody pretender
You're all I hate
Bloody pretender
Now I'm seeing through your masquerade
