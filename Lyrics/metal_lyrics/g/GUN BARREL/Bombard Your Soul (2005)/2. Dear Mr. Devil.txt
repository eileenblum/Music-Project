Four ugly motherfuckers
Pissing gasoline
Sworn to rock 'n' roll
Through thick and thin
Hellraiser maniacs
This tune is for you
Bang your head
And shake your fist
If you don't know what to do

We don't need no Cadillacs
No silver and no gold
All we need is to play it loud
Out on the road
The taste of dirt and sweat and tears
Is what we feeding on
This is what it's all about
We're rocking on

Hey - Mr. Devil
We've got some wicked souls on sale

Listen up you hounds of hell
This devil - dude ain't bad
He gave us blues and rock 'n' roll
So we can bang our heads
Sure this ain't no breaking news
I guess that you agree
We've heard before that hell
Ain't such a real bad place to be

We don't need no house or boats
No cages made of gold
All we want is to play it loud
Out on the road
We don't need no gourmet dining
It's dirt we're feeding on
Man that's what it takes for rocking on

Hey - Mr. Devil
We've got some wicked souls on sale
Hey - Mr. Devil
This truly is a bargain
The contract is in your mail

Dear Mr. Devil, we hope this finds you well
Find enclosed our contract of hell
Take it or leave it
The choice is up to you
But don't forget the pay when it's due

We don't need no house or boats
No cages made of gold
All we want is to play it loud
Out on the road
The taste of dirt and sweat and tears
Is what we're feeding on
This is what it's all about
We're rocking on

Hey - Mr. Devil
We've got some wicked souls on sale
Hey - Mr. Devil
This truly is a bargain
The contract is in the mail
This truly is a bargain
Ooh - Mr. Devil
Check your fucking mailbox man
