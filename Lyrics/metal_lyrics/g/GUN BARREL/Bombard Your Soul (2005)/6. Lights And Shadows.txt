When I look back - back upon my time
Chances that I've missed - others that I've grabbed
Would it be the same now
If I'd chosen another way

Standing at the crossroads - more than a million times
Didn't know right from wrong - hanging on the line
Would it be the same now
If I'd chosen another way

Lights and shadows are standing side by side
You decide which way to go in life
Lights and shadows are standing side by side
You decide which way you wanna try

I've tried to change all I could change
Some other changes I never gave a try
How to decide which change is right
Make up your mind - and be a little wise
and and be a little wise

Draw the bow - close your eyes
Let the arrow find its way
and it'll find a way

Lights and shadows
Between my lights and shadows

Lights and shadows
Lights and shadows
Lights and shadows

When I think about it - in a silent night
A voice is whispering deep inside me - man you're right
With your true heart and faith
You will find your way

'cause and
Lights and shadows are standing side by side
You decide which way you wanna try
Lights and shadows are standing side by side
Listen to your heart and you will find
