I think it's time to rise and shine
Depression's just a waste of time
Life could change in a wink of an eye
Don't let it pass you by

It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor
Whatever you do
You just gotta feel sure
Trust and believe in who you are
Don't hide your golden heart

There's a monster behind every door
You can beat 'em
If you know the score
Good things in life can hurt so bad
But that's the way it goes baby

The wheels are turning
It's all a circle of life, my friend
You gotta learn to fall
To rise again

Keep on movin'
Day by day
And maybe you'll go down in history
Keep on movin'
Don't be frail
You gotta walk on down that same old trail

You're feelin' down, burned out
Nothin' left to give
Believe me, as hard as it seems
Life won't do you in

Hold on, be strong
On your feet, take another swing
Hear the ringin' of that bell
Get back in the ring

The wheels are turning
It's all a circle of life, my friend
You gotta learn to fall
To rise again

Keep on movin'
Day by day
And maybe you'll go down in history
Keep on movin'
D-d-don't be frail
You gotta walk on down that same old trail

Sometimes it makes no sense
You can't do it no more
It's a pretty normal feeling brother
You've got to ignore
You've gotta keep your motor runnin'
'cause gridlock means death
So rev up that engine now
And get me out of this place

The wheels are turning
And we're still learning that same old game
You gotta learn to fall
To rise again

Keep on movin'
Day by day
And maybe you'll go down in history
Keep on movin
D-d-don't be frail
You gotta walk on down that same old trail
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
