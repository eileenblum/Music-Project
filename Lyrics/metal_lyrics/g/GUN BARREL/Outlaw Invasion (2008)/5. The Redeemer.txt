It's lying in wait
Every night every day
Rising in you as you sleep
It whispers your name
Guides you your way
Tales of the brave
So follow the trail

Visions of war
Cobwebbed lore
Keeping you right on the scent
Tear down the walls
Open the door
Heritage calls
Kingdoms will fall

Ancient powers waiting
Slumber in your veins
Older than the hills
His splendor will remain

You cannot renounce your legacy
And never be afraid
Protects you from enemies
Hold on to your faith
From anguish and agony
Delivering you from pain
So trust the Redeemer
The Redeemer in the end

Acknowledge the fury
That runs in your blood
Your newborn anger prevails
You will endure
So let it be heard
If you believe
You never will fail

Ancient powers waiting
Now you realize
Older than the hills
His majesty will rise

You cannot renounce your legacy
And never be afraid
Protects you from enemies
Hold on to your faith
From anguish and agony
Delivering you from pain
So trust the Redeemer
The Redeemer in the end
