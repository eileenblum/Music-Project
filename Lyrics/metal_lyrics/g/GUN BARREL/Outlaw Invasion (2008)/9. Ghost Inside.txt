We've been through hell
To hell and back
We fought a thousand demons on our way
Fearless and primed
For the next attack
No, nothing gets us down
We're not afraid

Wholehearted, unworried
We'll meet the fate at hand
With the power and the glory
Carry out god's plan

I will never ever go away
I'll be by your side
Forever and a day
And even when I'm gone
Just close your eyes
Swear I will remain
Eternal like a ghost inside

What we once began
Lasts for evermore
If I am near
Or on a distant shore
Everlasting
Until the end of time
Whatever befall us
We'll survive

Wholehearted, unworried
We'll meet the fate at hand
With the power and the glory
Carry out gods plan

I will never ever go away
I'll be by your side
Forever and a day
And even when I'm gone
Just close your eyes
Swear I will remain
Eternal like a ghost inside
