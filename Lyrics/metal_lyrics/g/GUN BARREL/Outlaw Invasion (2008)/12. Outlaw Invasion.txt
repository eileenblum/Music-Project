I can feel it, almost taste it
Danger's lyin' in the air
A misty crawling darkness
A land in dark despair
Seems to be so quiet
Seems to be so calm
That's just an illusion
Right before the storm
Deadly silence
Breathing down your neck
Heartbeat's a hammer
You break out in a sweat

You turn your face to heaven
Start to pray
Inside you know tomorrow
Brings irreversible change

Here comes the outlaw invasion
To take on this world for a better day
Outlaws crossing our nation
Fight and kill, making us free again

Rebel against all systems
Stand up for what is right
Godforsaken outlaws
Taking up the fight
Calling us all
To the final war
To let this infected empire fall

No turning back
'cause it's all said and done
The underground is restless
Revolution has begun

Here comes the outlaw invasion
To take on this world for a better day
Outlaws all over the nation
Fight and kill, making us free again

You turn your face to heaven
Start to pray
Inside you know tomorrow
Brings on the crossroads of fate

Here comes the outlaw invasion
To take on this world for a better day
Outlaws crossing our nation
Fight and kill, making us free again
Make us free again
Please make us free again
