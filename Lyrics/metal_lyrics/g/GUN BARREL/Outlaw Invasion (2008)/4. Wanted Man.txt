Every single morning
When I open up my eyes
I' got the same old picture in my head
I've got that urgent feelin' and I want it
Hope that I'll live that long
And I'll have it
Too see you burn in hell
Would be the greatest thing for me
Just make my wish come true
And set me free
I would give so much to see the day
Oh I want It
Lord I want it so bad

Your arrogance
You know it makes me sick
You're on top of the world
You can suck my dick
You made a fast career
Building towers of fear
A user, an abuser
You're too far gone
And it won't be long
You'll lose it
Dude, you're going down

Got no class
You can kiss my ass
You preach religious war
But we know the score
Spreading media lies
Just to capitalize
A taker, wanna break ya
You can scream you can yell
But I'll see you burn in hell

You're wanted
You're a wanted man
I'll see you hang by the neck until your dead
You're wanted
You're a wanted man
I'll see you hang by the neck until your dead

Axis of evil
Did you lose your mind?
Serial killers should be doin' time
And you know it
You can run you can hide
Use your family ties
You can scream you can yell
But I'll see you burn in hell

You're wanted
You're a wanted man
I'll see you hang by the neck until your dead
You're wanted
You're a wanted man
I'll see you hang by the neck until your dead

Please make my wish come true
And set me free
