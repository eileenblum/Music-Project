Sittin' here
Late at night
The last whisky in my hand
Yeah the show was great
Staring into the night
Thoughts are runnin' through my head

Everything in my life
Like a perfect deal, a bit unreal
Heard your lovely voice
Last night on the phone
The sound of your words
I still hear
You said you love me still
Babe I miss you so

What if I would fall asleep
And my soul would fly away
To where it belongs
If I'd never open up my eyes again
And for me tomorrow never comes

It was a warm embrace
A fast kiss goodbye
Yeah we were runnin' outta time
Now my fear starts growin'
That this will never be again
This warm and tender feelin'
Just holdin' your hand

What if I would fall asleep
And my soul would fly away
To where it belongs
If I'd never open up my eyes again
And for me tomorrow never comes

No way to make things better
No way, not here, not now
I can hardly face the moment
This yearning deep inside
The only wish that I still have
Please let me awake again
Don't let this be my final end

What if I would fall asleep
And for me tomorrow never comes
