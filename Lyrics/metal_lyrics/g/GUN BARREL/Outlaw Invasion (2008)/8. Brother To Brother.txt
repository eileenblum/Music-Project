Listen up
On a sacred road named rock and roll
We capture every town
We take great pains to leave behind
Holy burning ground
Sworn that we'd make it
And time showed we were right
When you're livin' in true brotherhood
You face every fight
Like a motherfucker
Here's my middle finger
Fight the good fight
Struggle for the dream
Die-hard blood brothers
Lean and mean machines

We stand tall
No one stands alone
It's one for all
And all for one

Brother to brother
Respect and cover
Head out
Ridin' for our lives
We stand together
Into forever
Until the day we die
The day we die

So we're back
Stand strong
Relentless is our spirit
Keeping us alive
We're gonna roll you over
And leave the rest behind
Like a motherfucker

We stand tall
No one stands alone
It's one for all
And all for one

Brother to brother
Respect and cover
Head out
Ridin' for our lives
We stand together
Into forever
Until the day we die

Like the good and the bad and the ugly
We ride for eternity
We're soaring on wings of tomorrow
Unbound and free

Brother to brother
Respect and cover
Head out
Ridin' for our lives
We stand together
Into forever
From Day One till the day we die
