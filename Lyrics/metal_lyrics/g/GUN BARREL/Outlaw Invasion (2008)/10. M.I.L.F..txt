Sometimes I'm goin' mad
Workin' 9 to 5 until my death
It ain't right to operate all day
That's not my style, that's not my way

Countdown for the weekend
Rock all night, rock all day
Time is on our side
Work is far away

M.I.L.F.
Magical moments
M.I.L.F.
That's all I need

Paperwork can be a living hell
God please release me from this prison cell
I've got this magic place where I can dream
Slip into my secret world of fantasies

Enjoying every moment
The way I wanna be
Life seems to be so easy
When you're free yeah

M.I.L.F.
Magical moments
M.I.L.F.
Makin' me feel like a man
M.I.L.F.
Mystical omens
M.I.L.F.
I'm doin' the best that I can

Keepin' me alive
Like the air that I breathe
My religion, all I need
Picks me up when I'm down
When I'm on my knees
Bringin' the devil out in me

M.I.L.F.
Magical moments
M.I.L.F.
Makin' me feel like a man
M.I.L.F.
Mystical omens
M.I.L.F.
I'm doin' the best that I can
M.I.L.F.
