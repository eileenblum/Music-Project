Today I'm here
But gone tomorrow
That is my way
I've paid my dues
Lived my whole life
Without no sorrow
My own creation's what I choose

Will you forget me when I'm gone
Forget my deeds, my face, my name
I don't mind, don't give a damn, no
For me it always stays the same

So many times
I tried to settle down
Wastin' my time
I've been a jerk
So many times
I've tried to turn around
Now I realize
That ain't how it works

Sometimes I dream hard
For a brand new start
Live my life in a different way
I watch the years go by
Don't want my life
Turn another shade of grey

I am lookin' for a wonder
Always lookin' for a sign
I gotta add, I still ain't found none
Sometimes truth is hard to find

When you ask me
What I am, how I am
Lost in my thoughts deep inside
You want an answer
You wouldn't understand
What can I say
That's just my life

Sometimes I dream hard
For a brand new start
Live my life in a different way
I watch the years go by
Don't want my life
Turn another shade of grey
The choices I made, I create
A dead end street
No turning back
If I'd try to change or rearrange
Then my sun would turn to black
