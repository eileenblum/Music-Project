Walkin' on a thin line
Always swim against the tide
I live my life the hard way
Don't tell me what is wrong or right
I want easy action
And I take it in the moment
When I need it
There is nothing there to hold me
Yeah you better believe it

I want it to the max
Yeah to the full
Like every day could be my last
That kind of class
You just don't learn in school
So come aboard
Life is such a blast

cause I am cheap wild and nasty
I'm proud of what I am
The unbreakable man

Cheap, wild &amp; nasty
And I don't mind
You'll never understand

You love me or you hate me
There is nothing in between
I'm just a psychedelic freak, man
But cut me and I'll bleed
If you think that you can push me
Come on mother make my day
Don't talk so condescending
Get out of my hair, out of my face

I want it to the max
Yeah to the full
Like every day could be my last
That kind of class
You just don't learn in school
But that's the kind of life
You will never understand

cause I am cheap wild and nasty
I'm proud of what I am
The unbreakable man
Cheap, wild &amp; nasty
It's too late
To change the way I am

Cheap, wild &amp; nasty
I'm proud of what I am
The unbreakable man
Cheap, wild &amp; nasty
And I don't mind
You'll never understand
cause I am cheap wild and nasty
I'm the incredible unbreakable man
cause I am cheap wild and nasty
And I don't care
You'll never ever understand anyway
