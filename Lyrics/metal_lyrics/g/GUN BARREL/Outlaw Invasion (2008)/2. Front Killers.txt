Heyho out there you motherfuckers
Here we're back again
For some we are the heroes
For some a pestilence
Playing fast and loud
Nobody can ignore
Our old school heavy metal
That's what we're living for

We're buildin' steam
For smashing down the walls
Just to show you
Who's got bigger balls

Livin' our lives on the edge
Like every day could be our last
Tattooed fucked up rockers
Just here for kickin' ass
We're high octane
The injection you need
Get the hell out of the kitchen
If you can't stand the heat

Standing tall
Our faith in music
Living our perfect dream
We came here
To take the roof off
Just to hear you scream

We're pleased to invite ya
Welcome to our show
We are frontkillers
We never let go
Piss on our enemies
We don't give a fuck
We are frontkillers
Just wanna rock

Reload our weapons
And let the bullets fly
Takin' no prisoners
Do or die
Don't start about hell
We've been there before
Let the metal do the talkin'
Let the engine roar

Standing tall
Our faith in music
Living our perfect dream
We came here
To take the roof off
Just to hear you scream

We're pleased to invite ya
Welcome to our show
We are frontkillers
We never let go
Piss on our enemies
We don't give a fuck
We are frontkillers
Just wanna rock

We're running high on adrenaline
Ready to explode
Fueled with fire and gasoline
Smells like rock and roll

Standing tall
Our faith in music
Living our perfect dream
We came here
To take the roof off
Just to hear you scream

We're pleased to invite ya
Welcome to our show
We are frontkillers
We never let go
Piss on our enemies
We don't give a fuck
We are frontkillers
We just wanna rock
We're pleased to invite you
Welcome to our show
We are frontkillers
We never ever let go
