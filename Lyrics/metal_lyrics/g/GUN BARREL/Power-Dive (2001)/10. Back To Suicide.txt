[G. Feldhausen]

Fall back on suicide

Ride the highway, feeling strong
Feel the power, life goes on
Out of the dark into the light
Strong enough for another fight
You've got the wings and learned to fly
Up into the open sky
Got the might to break that wall
That was built around your soul

[Chorus:]
Now you spread your wings to fly
Tomorrow you fall back on suicide

Falling down in a deepest hole
Lose the power, lose control
Your broken wings gonna let you fall
Nobody can hear hear your call
Will anybody save your soul
Take away that pain from you
Will anybody understand
Your solution at the end

[Chorus:]
Now you spread your wings to fly
Tomorrow you fall back on suicide
Now you spread your wings to fly
Tomorrow you fall back on suicide

[Bridge:]
Spread your wings and fly, oho
Do you really wanna die, oho
Back to suicide, oho

Fall back on, fall back on, fall back on suicide

[Chorus:]
Now you spread your wings to fly
Tomorrow you fall back on suicide
Now you spread your wings to fly
Tomorrow you fall back on suicide

Fall back on, fall back on, fall back on suicide
