[G. Feldhausen]

I was born under a bad sign out in the cold
In the darkness I can feel my burning soul
Mama don't accept all the things I do
But I still walk on my way and I think that's true

[Chorus:]
So Mama this Rocksong is just for you
And I'm singing my sad song for all like you, yes I do

It's a real hard life you know it's the unfair game
Feels like black clouds have frozen all my pain
No use crying cause I can't go back
Seems like white light turned into black

[Chorus:]
So I'm singing my Rocksongs to find the truth
And I'm singing my sad song for the ones like you

Rain's falling down deep on the ground
Hope that it will wash away my pain
I open the door someone's closed before
Hope to find what I'm searching for

[Bridge:]
Will I find the secrets you'll keep from me
I'll break that chain to set me free

This is my life there's no compromise
I swear that I won't go down again
Behind the door is what I'm looking for
The reason for the things I've done before

[Bridge:]
I will find the secrets you'll keep from me
I'll break that chain to set me free
I'm singing my Rocksong to find the truth
I'm singing this Rocksong just for you

I know sooner or later I will pay the price
Don't tell me something else I don't need no lies
Will someone come along to play my game
If you think you've got the courage just call my name

[Chorus:]
I'm singing this Rocksong to find the truth
And I'm singing my sad song for all like you

[Bridge:]
I will find the secrets you'll keep from me
I'll break that chains to set me free
I'm singing my Rocksong to find the truth
I'm singing my Rocksong just for you

I was born under a bad sign out in the cold
Born under a bad sign out in the cold
Born under a bad sign out in the cold
