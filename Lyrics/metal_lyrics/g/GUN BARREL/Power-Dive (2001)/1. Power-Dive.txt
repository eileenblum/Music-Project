[G. Feldhausen]

We're dancing with the devil
We do it all night long
We offer you a bad life
Inside of hell and outside of the law
We're riding with a demon
We load those guns to shoot
Spread the arms and let us fall
Innocence is no excuse, oh no

[Bridge:]
Down that lonely, open road where we have learned to fight
That's where we win and where we lose you can't deny the truth
Take this hand and follow me I'll show you something new
We take you to the other side there's nothing else to lose

[Chorus:]
Power - dive, deep into the night
Power dive, do you wanna change your life

We're living at the crossroads
This world is spinning round
We know the way we're going
Nobody can bring us down, oh no
Ready for the countdown
A point of no return
Don't wanna change the world
But we wanna let the fire burn

[Bridge:]
Down that lonely, open road where we have learned to fight
That's where we win and where we lose you can't deny the truth
Take this hand and follow me I'll show you something new
We take you to the other side there's nothing else to lose

[Chorus:]
Power - dive, deep into the night
Power - dive, that will change your life

Up and down deep in the ground rising high into the sky
Falling down into a hole, it's a power - dive
Ready for the countdown let the fire burn to a point
A point of no return break all limits don't think twice, power - dive

[Bridge:]
Down that lonely, open road where we have learned to fight
That's where we win and where we lose you can't deny the truth
Take this hand and follow me I'll show you something new
We take you to the other side there's nothing else to lose

[Repeat Chorus]
