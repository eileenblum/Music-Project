[G. Feldhausen]

I'm walking down along a desert road
The black sun's coming down and I can feel the cold
Look into the mirror that never lies
Would it bring me back to take me to the other side, oh

On my way of life I left my trace behind
I sometimes had a feeling this is the end of the line
Take me to the stars and let me die
I will come again but I ain't the same

[Chorus:]
Yes it's gone with the wind
But I can't take it alone
And I wanna cry out
But I still run around
And now I run like the wind
And I'm falling down
And I wanna cry out
But I still run around
Is it gone with the wind

Riding on a train I can't control
Takes me to a place I've never been before
The road to nowhere's gonna pass me by
Time to change that life and say goodbye

[Chorus:]
Yes it's gone with the wind
But I can't take it alone
And I wanna cry out
But I still run around
And now I run like the wind
And I'm falling down
And I wanna cry out
But I still run around
Is it gone with the wind

Still I'm walking down a desert road
The black sun's coming down and I can feel the cold
I look into the mirror that never lies
It will bring me back to the other side

[Repeat Chorus]
