[G. Feldhausen]

I'm living on a highway
In a world of Rock`n?Roll
I'm living on an endless road
In a neverending show
And sometimes when I'm tired
I keep saying it's too much
But I know that I'm a liar
Cause that's what lights my fire

[Chorus:]
Take me to the highway, can't stop playing Rock`n?Roll
Let me go

I hear the people talking
Hear them talking from behind
They say that I'm a bad guy
And I know that they are right
I don't need no big jet
I don't need no limousine
All I need is Rock`n?Roll
Satisfaction guaranteed

[Chorus:]
Take me to the highway, can't stop playing Rock`n?Roll
Let me go
Take me to that highway, don't stop my dirty show
Let me go
Into a big, bad rolling show

Another place another town
I still can't get enough
Walking out on another stage
I'm made of sterner stuff
And sometimes when I'm tired
I keep saying it's too much
But I know that I'm a liar
Cause thats what lights my fire

[Chorus:]
Take me to the highway, can't stop playing Rock`n?Roll
Let me go
Take me to that highway, don't stop my dirty show
Let it roll
Take me to that highway, let me go
Take me to that highway, let it roll
