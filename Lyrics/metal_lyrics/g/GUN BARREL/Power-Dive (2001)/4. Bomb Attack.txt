[G. Feldhausen]

Let the sound take you back to "Thunder &amp; road"
Raise up these dirty hands into the air
Let metal speak, gonna set you free and let the power flow
Won't you feel the touch of evil, or beware

Have you got a gun, we are on the run to break the law
My vital spark is poison in my veins
Let me ride the spirit horse into the hunting grounds
We believe in metal, we stand proud and tall

[Chorus:]
Don't you hear the bomb attack
The hard attack
Won't you hear that bomb attack

I don't need no preacher man telling me what to do
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Set the night on fire, takes you higher, let the thunder roll
All metal maniacs out of control

[Chorus:]
Don't you hear the bomb attack
The hard attack
Won't you hear that bomb attack

Don't you hear the bomb attack
The hard attack
Won't you hear that bomb attack
Don't you hear the bomb attack
