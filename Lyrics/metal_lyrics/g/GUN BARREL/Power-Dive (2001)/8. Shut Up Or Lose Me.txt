[G. Feldhausen]

He plays guitar and feels so fine
Heavy metal all the time
Sometimes fast sometimes slow
They called him Mr. Rock`n?Roll
One day how could he know
A woman came along to stop the show
He said: You're so pretty yes I know
But the boys are gonna tell me: Let her go!

[Chorus:]
Shut up, shut up
Shut up or lose me
Shut up, shut up
Shut up or lose me

He plays with the girl and feels so fine
In a pink bedroom all the time
Sometimes fast sometimes slow
After a while it's a boring show
One day how good to know
The boys are back playing Rock`n?Roll
He said: You're still pretty yes I know
Have a drink on me and let me go

[Chorus:]
Shut up, shut up
Shut up or lose me
Shut up, shut up
Shut up or lose me

[Repeat Chorus]
