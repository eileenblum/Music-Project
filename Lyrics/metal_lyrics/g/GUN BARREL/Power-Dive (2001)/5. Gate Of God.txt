[G. Feldhausen]

A child was born in the valley of kings
In the dark age of the war and pain
His father told him how to fight
And he gave the son the sword of might
To the king of the lords
The king of the lords

Find your way, defend the poor
You've got the courage and be shure
The kingdom will be born again
You will find the way to the neverland
The gate of the gods
The gate of the gods

And he moves Into a battle start the crusade
The warrior of death
He's got a heart full of rage, the power and the blade
The warrior of death
Out in the fields, they fall down one by one
Nothing can stop the king of the lords the king and the god

Tell me my father, tell me who I am
Am I the chosen one, will I be the king
And will I go to find the way,
To the Promised land
Tell me if I will survive and will I carry on

The gate of the gods

Years gone by and the time has come
People said he's the chosen one
The kingdom it was born again
But he couldn't find the neverland
The gate of the gods
The gate of the gods

He told his people: "Fight again"
They ask him how to find that land
He said they have to go to war
And they will find it at the end

And he moves into the battle and start the crusade
The warrior of death
He's got a heart full of rage, the power and blade
The warrior of death
Out in the fields, they fall down one by one
Nothing can stop the king of the lords the king and the god

Tell me my father, tell me who I am
Am I the chosen one, will I be the king
And will I go to find the way,
To the Promised land
Tell me if I will survive and will I carry on

The gate of the gods

Listen the last battle cry
Gravestone tell's you that he died
People said that in the end
He has found the neverland
