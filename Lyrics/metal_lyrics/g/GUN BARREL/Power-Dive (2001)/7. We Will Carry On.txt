[G. Feldhausen]

Yes we all stand together as firm as a rock
No time for losers no step back cause we can't stop
All time winners all the time on the run
Don't try to stop me cause we will overcome
Are you ready to fly high
Spread your metal-wings
We wanna cross, we wanna cross the sky
Even when we die

Inside outside knocking on my door
Up down turn around give a little more
People say we're crazy but we wanna have fun
Take it to the limit and fly into the sun
Are you ready to fly high
Spread your metal-wings we wanna cross the sky
Prime time my time take it to the sun
Pump it up stand in line feel like number one

[Chorus:]
We will carry on, together we are strong
No one out there's alone
Yes we'll carry on, no one stays alone
Always side by side
We carry on, we carry on

Don't look back on your life just go on to do it right
It's a rise it's a fall but everybody stand proud and tall
All time winners all the time on the run
Don't try to stop me cause we will overcome
Are you ready to fly high
Spread your metal-wings we wanna cross the sky
Prime time my time take it to the sun
Pump it up stand in line feel like number one

[Chorus:]
We will carry on, together we are strong
No one out there's alone
Yes we'll carry on, no one stays alone
Always side by side
We carry on, we carry on
