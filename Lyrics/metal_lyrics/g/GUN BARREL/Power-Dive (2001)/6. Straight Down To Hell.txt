[G. Feldhausen]

You take the bullet
Load your gun to kill
Will it find a victim
Fate will take it there

The smell of death surrounds you
When the bullet find its target
You wash your hands in innocence
But the next one could be you

[Chorus:]
Nobody will surrender
Don't wanna fall down
Straight down to hell
Do you think that you will
Living here forever
You're gonna fall down
Straight down to hell

Now you are broken
Someone's watching you
Reaper's knocking at your door
Spend a day in hell with you

Too late to put your guns away
Last bullet's from the Reaper
He comes to pay it back to you
Your nightmare's coming true

[Chorus:]
Now you will surrender
Don't wanna fall down
Straight down to hell
Do you think that you will
Living here forever
You're gonna fall down
Straight down to hell
