[G. Feldhausen]

All of your life you've tried to survive
You're working so hard to get a real good start
You won't be a loser, you will be the first one
You can't break free, that's your destiny

[Chorus:]
The time has come to say goodbye
Your rising sun will fall
Grim Reaper comes to speak his words
You know that you'll always be:
Only a passenger
We are only passengers

You win one battle you don't win the war
You're standing so tall with your back on the wall
The iron wheel breaks you, too tired to defend
Are you really a rich man when it comes to the end

[Chorus:]
The time has come to say goodbye
Your rising sun will fall
Grim Reaper comes to speak his words
You see that you'll ever be:
Only a passenger
We are only passengers

And when you are broken the last word is spoken
Fire is burned-out, what about your pride
Look into the mirror tell me what do you see
Here comes your last trip, now you'll be free

[Chorus:]
The time has come to say goodbye
Your rising sun will fall
Grim Reaper comes to speak his words
You know that you'll always be
Only a passenger, only a passenger

Only a passenger, we are only passengers
You are a passenger, we are only passengers
And we will break free
