Rise up to the storm
Been in and out of trouble
Since I saw my first guitar
I've had to get outta town on my double
I ain't runnin' anynmore

Thunderheads are building
Threaten to swallow the land
Gonna lean into the mayhem
And rise up to the storm

Over the crimson horizon
There's a future to be found
Gonna get my piece of the action
There ain't no two ways about it

I'm never gonna back down from it
I'm so damn close that I can taste it
So I'll be pushing on
To face the break of dawn
I'm gonna rise up to the storm

Dog fight
Till the morning light
And I'd rather be fighting my way
'Cause everytime I took a gamble
There was Devil in the deck

Stay on track of what it's all about
Keep my head out of the clouds
It's a hard man's life and that's what I like
I ain't gonna take a bow

Found my sense of direction
I expect no helping hand
I'm taking my piece of the action
There ain't no two ways about it

I'm never gonna back down from it
I'm so damn close that I can taste it
So I'll be pushing ion
To face the break of dawn
I'm gonna rise up to the storm

It's a dog fight
All night
And it's alright
