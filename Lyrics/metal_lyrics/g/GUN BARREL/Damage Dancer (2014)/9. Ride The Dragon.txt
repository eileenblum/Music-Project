Hit the stream
Like a wave train
Your slug is punching through
Rapids boil
And chaos will reign
The quickening is due

River wild
Sliding high
Propels you to your fall
Max velocity
Hydro speed
Can you hear the sirens call

Savage current in your blood
Wired till you drop
Watch out for the undertow
it might just use you up

Ride the dragon
Got my face in the wind
And I challenge the gods to be free

On a hazard hunt
In the danger zone
Until your body breaks
Into the eye
Of the maelstrom
Defiant and enraged

Ride the dragon
Got my face in the wind
And I challenge the gods to be free
Ride the dragon
Atone for my sins
And I challenge my mortality
