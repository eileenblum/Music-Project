Hey little sister what's up with you
Making headlines with your new tattoo
Mommy don't mind when daddy doesn't care
Chasing your luck with a wild eyed stare

Money makes a difference
I know that it does
Money makes a difference
When you're selling your ass

You're heading for disaster

Did your rehab - now you're on the run
A rampant Mona Lisa coming undone
Years down the line and nothing left to tell
Tomorrow is your training day in Hell

Money makes a difference
I know that it does
Money makes a difference
When you're selling your ass

You're heading for disaster
You suck the air out of the room
My mind gets lost in your sweet perfume
