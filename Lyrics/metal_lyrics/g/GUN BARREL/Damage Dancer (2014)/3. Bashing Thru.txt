Soaking up the stardust
Sucking up the heat
Smoking up the ozone
Put it on the street
I'm your cosmic enforcer
I keep my whiskey clean
Velvet vigilante
For a carnival of freaks

Out of the darkness
With an appetite
I'm hungry and willing to fight
Rise to the fire
The flame burning bright
Turn my gaze to the skies

Burst into the clouds
I shall divide and rule
At whatever the cost
I'll keep on bashing thru

Unleashing the hounds
Into the stratosphere
I'm your spaced out invader
And I will persevere
The onslaught of a cycle
I got stars in my beard
The Duke is back in action
And I'm gunning out of here
