Dragging your feet
In smothering heat
King lizard will witness you bleed
In tatters and rags
You woke bound and gagged
Yesterdays good times gone bad

And oh your moment has come
To sort out your rights from your wrongs
You can't help but counting the skulls
Left there to bleach in the sun
They're humming and laughing and jesting
And calling my name

They left you behind
To wither and die
Life is a merciless crime
Hunters of doom
Eying your wounds
The reaper is beckoning you

And oh your moment has come
Can you fight back and carry the torch
Or run out like the sands of time
Returning your bones to the dust

Vultures are waiting
Circling in the sky
So keep moving
Vultures are waiting
Keep your dreams alive
Can't let terror rule your mind

Nowhere to hide
Eyes in the sky
Wait for your will to subside
Do you still dream
Do you believe
Can you survive this ordeal

And oh your moment has come
Can you fight back and carry the torch
Or run out like the sands of time
Returning your bones to dust

Vultures are waiting
Circling in the sky
So keep moving
Vultures are waiting
Keep your dreams alive
Can't let terror rule your mind

Toughen your will
To follow your heart
Let them speak in unison
Braving your fear
With the urge to carry on
Freeing your soul
From the shadow of death
Fight to survive
Raise your flag
And keep it flying high
