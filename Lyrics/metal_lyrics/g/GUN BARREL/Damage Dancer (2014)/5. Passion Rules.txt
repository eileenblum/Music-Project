Here I am spirit free
Unbroken by the law
Torn by love and violence
I've seen you rise and fall
Like a flaming tree
On holy ground
Rooted in your life
Your heroic pride
Or foolish hope
And I cut you like a knife

I'm in your blood
Now can you feel the fire
I'm in your soul
Your life or death decider
I'm in your bones
Now can you feel me reach you
My pain flies true
Passion rules
Passion rules

I'm your bleeding heart
Your burning gut
And the barrel of your gun
I'll keep you work so hard
Watch your rising star
Or the setting of your sun
You and me
We're bad company
Like stray dogs in the wild
Take it right to the edge
Like a man on the ledge
Now spread your wings and fly

I'm your fire
I'm your flame
Driving you insane
Your endless fight
I am your rage
The king of your reptile brown

All the lonely nights
You were fighting the world
You were nothing but a dreamer
You finally found the right door
To channel your rage
And it made you a believer
Now eternal screams
Will carry your dream
Out into the open
And through it all
Looking at you
One thing holds true
Passion rules
Passion rules

I'm your fire
I'm your flame
Driving you insane
Your endless fight
I am your rage
The king of reptile brain
Passion rules
