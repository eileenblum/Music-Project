Sick and tired of hangin' out
With the shuffling and undead
Loud and proud with an attitude
Like bullet to your head

Your jelly brain in the lost and found
Won't take you anywhere
I hit the streets in full riot gear
Cause tonight I just don't care

Smell of thunder in the air
I command the lightning's hand

So I'm counting down to judgment day
And i wouldn't have it any other way
Your evil empire engulfed in flames
Tonight you're going down tonight yea alright

Long haul scarred for life
Evade the eagle eye
Hard looks branded hearts
And a grim resolve to die

On and on the truth unfolds
Riding shotgun with your fears
We hit the streets in full riot gear
Just to show we still don't care

Smell of thunder in the air
I command the lightning's hand

So we're counting down to judgement day
And we wouldn't have it any other way
You better get on down your skinny knees and pray

Found my reasons
Found the trust
Blood and honor
Never rust away
