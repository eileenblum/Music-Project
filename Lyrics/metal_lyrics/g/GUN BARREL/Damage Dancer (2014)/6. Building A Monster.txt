I'm building a monster to clean up this mess
The streets must be ruled hard as nails
A B-Movie night is comin' your way
To visions of Evil I pray - I gotta get away

So tired of shouting when nobody hears
We look back in anger and we're watching you

My sinful creation, my spawn of revenge
He's soothing the rats in the walls
My army of madness shall wander this Earth
Awakened to settle the score - Kill 'em all

So tired of shouting when nobody hears
We look back in anger and we're watching you
You should have listened now you're living in fear
We're destined to swallow your soul

I'm building a monster
To shape things up right
It's holding the shadows at bay
I'm making a monster
To take what is mine
Luring the moth to the flame

I'm building a monster with vapor and steam
To wanton destruction you'll kneel
I'm a darklord commanding dominions of pain
Enlisting newborn renegades
So tired of shooting when nobody hears
We creep in the shadows we're following you
You should have listened now your reckoning's near
We're destined to swallow your soul

I'm building a monster
To do what is right
It's holding the voices at bay
I'm making a monster
To clean up this life
Luring the moth to the flame
We're following you
We swallow your soul
