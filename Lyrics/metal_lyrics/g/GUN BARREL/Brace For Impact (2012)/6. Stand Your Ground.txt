Blackened eyes
Some dreams are never pushed enough
Crimson skies
Vultures circling high above
Crown of thorns â years of scorn
Are slowly killing you inside
Faith outworn â ripped and torn
The time has come to realize

Face your demons
You've got to play it right
Stop your grieving
And rise above the tide

Oh you've got to stand your ground
Head out
To cross the sea of doubt around you
You've got to walk on down
Head out
There is no mercy to be found
So stand your ground

Paralyzed
The sands of time are running fast
Hypnotized
Feeding the phantoms of the past
Come the day â you'll find your way
Stop suckin' up to your own fear
For those who swayâ there's hell to pay
It's time to cross the last frontier
Face your demons
You've got to play it right
Nothing worthwhile
Ever comes without a fight

Oh you've got to stand your ground
Head out
To cross the sea of doubt around you
You've got to walk on down
Head out
There is no mercy to be found
So stand your ground
