Relentless souls
Born for the road
Hunting for revenge
Light the fuse
We're bullet proof
We hit you hard as nails
Been to hell
To tell the tale
Of fortune hate and pain
Pierce your skull
With rock&amp;roll
Set your city up in flames

Oh bad to the bone
Fate carved in stone

Rocket machine
Strong medicine
We're the new freaks on the scene
Electric doom
Or an early tomb
It's harder than it seems
Cock fights
Endless lies
Rippin' out your heart
Steel your soul
With rock&amp;roll
Blow them all to Mars

Oh ghosts of the past
Silenced at last

Hit you hard with diamond bullets
Embrace your anger never lose it
Life is hell just roll right through it
Fill the skies with diamond bullets

Plant the seeds
Fucking dirty deeds
Reap the spoils of war
On your feet
Or on your knees
You will burn forevermore
Mean streak
Let your thunder speak
Rev up your machine
Vaporize
And pulverize
Blow them all to smithereens

Yeah bad to the bone
Fate carved in stone
Hit them hard with diamond bullets
Embrace your anger never lose it
Life is hell just roll right through it
Fill the skies with diamond bullets
