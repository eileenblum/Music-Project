Leaving burned
Leaving burned roads behind
I'm no more
No more slave to the grind
I never thought
Never though there'd be the day
When I regain my faith
And I'm back on my trail

The animal inside me
Rears it's head to break free
Gotta let loose
Raise some hell â let it bleed

Went to the boss
Went to the boss and said I'm done
Punched his face
TKO and I was gone
When he came round
When he came round he knew
Stand up for your rights
Is what we all got to do
The animal inside
Rears it's head to break free
Gotta let loose
Raise some hell â let it bleed

C'mon c'mon
Let's start a riot again
C'mon c'mon
Let's start a riot once again
