In times of monbelievers
We're fighting tooth and nail
Stonehearted and relentless
Determined to prevail
We hit you like an avalanche
Get ready for the storm
We blast away your apathy
Attacking like a swarm

Our spirits rising
You try to change us
You'll go down
Time has come
No more compromising

With might
With might
With might and main

You're lecturing a hollow truth
That only blind can see
But seeing eyes refuse your lies
Reject your tyranny
We dealt with scum like you before
You dirty little sleaze
We'll put you out of action
We'll force you to your knees

Our spirits rising
You try to change us
You'll go down
Time has come
No more compromising

With might
With might
With might and main

We'll never falter
We're still standing tall
So don't try to mess with our minds
You'd be heading for a fall
We grant you one last chance
To step out of our way
There won't be no sympathy
This is your Judgement Day

With might
With might
With might and main
