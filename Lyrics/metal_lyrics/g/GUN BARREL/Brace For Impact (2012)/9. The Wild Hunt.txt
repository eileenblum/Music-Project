I'm pointing a gun at the head of god
Can't seem to control, what the fuck is going on
I wonder what is like to listen to my inner voice
What it's like to not be on the run

Wherever I go my fear's on the prowl
Roaming the streets but can't see the bottom line
Devil in my neck, pulls my strings, reigns my mind
I'm losing track you know I'm running out of time

There is no rest for me
Driven by a might that I'll never grasp
There's nothing left to give
Can't see a future already lost my past

There's no escape
The wild hunt
There's no one safe
The wild hunt
There's no remorse
The wild hunt
Collision course
I'm on a wild hunt

What I feared the most now shapes my today
Tomorrow seems so dark and monochrome
Will I survive? Will I get out of here?
Is there a reason for my grief? Am I the cause?

There is no rest for me
Driven by a might that I'll never grasp
There's nothing left to give
Can't see a future already lost my past

There's no escape
The wild hunt
There's no one safe
The wild hunt
There's no remorse
The wild hunt
Collision course
I'm on a wild hunt
