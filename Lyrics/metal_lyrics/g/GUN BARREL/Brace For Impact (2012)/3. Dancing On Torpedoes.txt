That bitch is bending over
You know she likes it really rough
She's moaning like an alley cat
Oh man she does the wicked stuff
She was dancing in the first row
Acting cool and hard to get
As I finally got her backstage
The joint was getting' soaking wet

We're onto something special
Movin' in for the kill
But there's three other guys
Waitin' round for their fill

Dancing on torpedoes
Kiss the barrel of a gun
Dancing on torpedoes
She's turning up the heat for everyone

Taking care of business
Nailed against the wall
Now we got her spread-eagle
Gotta keep her on the ball
What comes around goes around
Do the backstage ABC
She fills me up with sheer emotion
And I feel her up with me

We're onto something special
Movin' in for the kill
The credo's loud and clear
Do what thou wilt

Dancing on torpedoes
Kiss the barrel of a gun
Dancing on torpedoes
She's got enough love for everyone

Exhilaration my damnation
Hell unbound
Emancipation of temptation
It's going down

Can I call you honey
Cause I feel kinda true
She says: I'm not that kind of girl
Cause all I wanna do is

Dancing on torpedoes
Kiss the barrel of a gun
Dancing on torpedoes
She's got enough love for everyone
Dancing on torpedoes
Kiss the barrel of a gun
Dancing on torpedoes
