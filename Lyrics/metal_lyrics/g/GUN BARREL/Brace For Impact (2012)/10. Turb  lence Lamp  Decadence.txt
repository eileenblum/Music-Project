All thoughts are written
All cards are given
All words are spoken
And I sense no fear

How I wish I could make amends
Decadence and turbÃ¶lence
Forgotten voices haunting me
I pray my restless soul to keep

A new dimension
Another life
A new beginning
On the other side
Cracks in the sunlicht
Cracks in my soul
No reason to hide in here
In this dirty rotten hole

I took the golden ladder
But it dragged me down to hell
TurbÃ¶lence and decadence
Made my life an empty shell
I reached out for the heavens
But I made it to hell
TurbÃ¶lence and decadence
No chance to break the spell

Depressions are my master
The darkness and the night
Still searching for the exit
To return into the light

I took the golden ladder
But it dragged me down to hell
TurbÃ¶lence and decadence
Made my life an empty shell
I reached out for the heavens
But I made it to hell
TurbÃ¶lence and decadence
No chance to break the spell
