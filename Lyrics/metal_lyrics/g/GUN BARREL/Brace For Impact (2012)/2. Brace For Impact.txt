We are the chosen few
We're comin' down on you
We'll leave you crashed&amp;burned behind
We're on a vengeance trip
We haven't lost our grip
A ride that devastates your mind

Yeah alright
Raging fury wild beast
Oh alright
Open fire nail you down &amp; reload

An airborne force untamed
We spit unholy flames
Another victory to our name
We're here to stake our claim
Though faces may have changed
You know the spirit stays the same

Yeah alright
Raging fury wild beast on the road
Oh alright
Bulding pressure 'till your skull will
Explode

We're the stallions of the heavens
We're the rules of the night
Our reign shall last forever
Even gods don't dare to fight

Brace for impact
At 16000 feet
That's where we finally meet
It's meant to be my fist your face
We're rotten to the core
We're here to let it roar
Driven by anger fueled by hate

Yeah alright
Lightning charged the thunder will roll
Oh alright
It's do or die electrifying your soul
