Welcome to the new world
Where you flaws do not exist
Welcome to the new world
It'll give your life a twist
Afraid to end up all alone
As you're drawn into my web
We'll shape your new reality
As you fall into my lap

Books of life designed by visions
No need to face scorn and derision

Come into my toyland
Where the streets are made of gold
Come into my toyland
Where your fortune's still on hold

The world you're in's rejecting you
Lead a life of sunken dreams
There is no living hope in hell
When it's all binary scream

Books of life designed by visions
No need to face scorn and derision

Come into my toyland
Where the streets are made of gold
Come into my toyland
Where your fortune's still on hold

Now your future lies behind you
Close your eyes and you will see
Just erase the life that binds you
Cause connected we are free

Come into my toyland
Where the streets are made of gold
Come into my toyland
Where your fortune's still on hold

Where nobody leaves you alone
Where the streets are made of gold
Come into my toyland
Where your fortune's still on hold
