Your crystal heart was smashed to pieces
Years of pain that never cases
Damaged goods â unfinished puzzle
Flex your hate like an itching muscle

Caught in the rain without a shelter
Corrodes your brain â it's helter skelter
Just one thing in this world will save ya
And you need in now

Your distress calls â nobody answers
The picture's drawn and it spreads like cancer
Urgent problems â drastic measures
Cross the line to here ever after

Caught in the rain without a shelter
Corrodes your brain â it's helter skelter
Just one thing in this world will save ya
And you need in now
Can't stop waterboarding myself
Painful secrets
Comdemned me to hell

And I
I just gotta tear right out of this place
And I
I just gotta wipe the smile off your face

The big taboo
Crucifies you
The big taboo
The black hole in you

Here ever after calls your name
Here ever after knows your game
Here ever after feels no shame
Here ever after calls...

Can't stop waterboarding myself
Painful secrets
Comdemned me to hell

And I
I just gotta tear right out of this place
And I
I just gotta wipe the smile off your face

The big taboo
Crucifies you
The big taboo
The black hole in you
The big taboo
Suffocates you
The big taboo
Twin-headed beast in you
