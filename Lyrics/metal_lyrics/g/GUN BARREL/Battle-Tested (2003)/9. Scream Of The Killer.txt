[G. Feldhausen]

He was fighting for freedom all for the realm
He has heard the knell and he's seen pure hell
Hundreds were killed by the might of his sword
Too tired to fight cause there ain't no reward

Screaming
Scream of the killer

Again they are calling, they call him to war
Will he survive or will they let him die
And after all he has changed quiet a lot
He turned into a beast and the nightmare won't stop

Screaming
Scream of the killer

The scream of the killer that nobody heard
He will come back to take his revenge
Return of the killer always on the run
Everyone dies before the day is done

After the war when he's coming home
With a heart full of rage he hates everyone
Ready to kill he roams through the night
Don't turn your back or he will attack

Screaming
Scream of the killer

The scream of the killer that nobody heard
He will come back to take his revenge
Return of the killer always on the run
Everyone dies before the day is done

In his cold cell he's waiting he's ready to die
In the dark of the alleys you can hear his cry
People are screaming: Burn at the stake
He will return with all of his hate

Screaming
Scream of the killer

The scream of the killer that nobody heard
He will come back to take his revenge
Return of the killer always on the run
Everyone dies before the day is done
Before the day is done
