[G. Feldhausen]

Sex and drugs and Rock`n?Roll
That's what we are looking for
Whole lotta Rosie will never die
Lights up the Australian sky

Let the fire burn tonight
Let's get high when the band gets right
Raise your hands into the light
Time has come to feel alright
And the band plays on

Rosie's dancing on the table
When she's drunker than she's able
Tell me who should leave the hall
I'm sure you know them all

Let the fire burn tonight
Let's get high when the band gets right
Raise your hands into the light
Time has come to feel alright

Party, party in the hall of fame
Party time in the hall of fame
Party in the hall of fame

If you don't know what to do
Here is some advice for you
Kill a king or break the law
Run to the hills, your balls to the wall
Go insane eat your brain
Tie your mother down tonight
Slip inside my sleeping bag
Watch out for a heart attack

Let's get high when the band gets right
Raise your hands into the light
Time has come to feel alright

Party, party in the hall of fame
Party time in the hall of fame
Party in the hall of fame

Be invited to the show
A journey into Rock`n?Roll
Iron, steel and Metal too
We're gonna give it all to you

Party, party in the hall of fame
Party time in the hall of fame
Party in the hall of fame
Welcome to the party
