[G. Feldhausen]

Little girl don't be shy
I'm gonna take you for a ride
I'll take you to the other side
To make you feel alright
Little angel take it slow
Take my hand and don't say no
Come along to play my game
You don't have to feel no shame

Let's do it on the road
My gun's reload
I'm a lover like a gun
Don't you wanna have fun

I'm a man and it's true
That I was made for loving you
Close your eyes turn out the lights
I'll make you feel alright
You can't run you can't hide
Tell me what you feel inside
I'll show you things you've never seen
In a brand new world tonight

Let's do it on the road
My gun's reload
I'm a lover like a gun
Don't you wanna have fun

Hey little girl let's do it on the highway
Let's do it in the night
In the silver light when the stars are shining bright
We're gonna feel right why don't we do it tonight
Don't feel ashamed you're driving me insane
Just play my game we'll do it again and again

Let's do it on the road
My gun's reload
I'm a lover like a gun
Don't you wanna have fun

Hey little girl let's do it on the highway
Let's do it in the night
In the silver light when the stars are shining bright
We're gonna feel right why don't we do it tonight
Don't feel ashamed you're driving me insane
Just play my game we'll do it again and again

Let's do it on the road
My gun's reload
I'm a lover like a gun
Don't you wanna have fun
