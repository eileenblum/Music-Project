[G. Feldhausen]

When the raven's in the sky
Black wings let him fly
The raven brought the pain
And many of us will die

In the fear of death
There's nothing left to regret
In the dawn we have to fight, yeah
And the rats come out at night

A cry in the still of the night
Will we ever see the light
I say free us from our chains
We are the broken men
When the raven brought the pain

Like a fallen angel always on the run
One hand for the Bible the other slings the gun
The priest blessed you he's calling us to pray
We'll follow the raven on his bloody way

We're riding down the hill battle's raging high
In the sign of the cross we're all gonna die
The reaper comes to sing his deadly song
That's the fate where we all belong

A cry in the still of the night
Will we ever see the light
I say free us from our chains
We are the broken men

When the raven brought the pain, oh yeah
Break the iron chains
Will you free us from the pain
We are the broken men
When the raven brought the pain

When the raven brought the pain, oh yeah
Break the iron chains
Will you free us from the pain
We are the broken men

When the raven brought the pain
In the night
When the raven brought the pain
