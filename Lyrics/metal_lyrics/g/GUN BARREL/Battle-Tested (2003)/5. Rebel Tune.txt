[G. Feldhausen]

Will you remember the age of the kings
When warriors crossed the land
We stand by your side to fight for your right
Born with a blade in your hand

We will follow your call
We will come when you call us to the war

Tyrants are coming to down us all
Fight to save our souls
Thousands will fall onto the battle
This is the tune of the rebel

Down, down and far away
I can see that Neverland
Hold out and take my hand
We will fight till the end

Sing the song of the rebel tune
Sing the song of the rebel tune
Raise your blades for victory

We carry the cross of the death
Hear our battle cry
We're brothers in arms we march for the war
Together we fight or we'll die

Down, down and far away
I can see that Neverland
Hold out and take my hand
We will fight till the end

Sing the song of the rebel tune
Sing the song of the rebel tune
Raise your blades for victory

Out on the field
Fall and be reborn
Onto the battle
This is the tune of the rebel

Down, down and far away
We can see that Neverland
Hold out and take my hand
We will fight till the end

Sing the song of the rebel tune
Sing the song of the rebel tune
Raise your blades for victory

Sing the song of the rebel tune
Far, far away
Sing the song of the rebel tune
I can see that neverland
Sing the song of the rebel tune
Take my hand
Sing the song of the rebel tune
We will fight until the end
