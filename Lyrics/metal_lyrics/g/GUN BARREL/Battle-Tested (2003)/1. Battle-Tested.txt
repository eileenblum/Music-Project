[G. Feldhausen]

Gunfire from the hill
Will bring the overkill
We're born to fight with a heart of steel
Comrades follow you
That's what we'll always do
One for all no one stands alone, no

Don't you hear me calling you at night
Are you ready to fight
To the glory raise your glasses high

Thousand bullets fly
Falling from the sky
We stand together not afraid to die
Riding against the wind
We're on a one way street
Follow the way straight down to hell

Don't you hear me calling you at night
Are you ready to fight
To the glory raise your glasses high

We are battle-tested
We are battle-tested
Yes and we, we are battle-tested

We're never going back
Again we will attack
Firing the gun till the battle's won
We fight at Wounded Knee
We set the spirit free
Born to fight with a heart of steel

Don't you hear me calling you at night
Are you ready to fight
To the glory raise your glasses high

We are battle-tested
We are battle-tested
Yes and we, we are battle-tested

Don't you hear me calling you at night
Are you ready to fight
To the glory raise your glasses high

We are battle-tested
We are battle-tested
Yes and we, we are battle-tested
We, we are battle-tested
Battle-tested, alright, bullets fly, we'll never die
