[G. Feldhausen]

Heart is beating fast time is standing still
The dice's in my hand the ultimate thrill
I can not resist, oh no

Adrenaline is pumping through my veins
Tonight I will be gambling the game of the games

Roll of the dice
Dancing with the devil
Roll of the dice
He looks at you with his snakes eyes
Roll, roll of the dice
Roll, roll of the dice

Bitten by a snake poison in my soul
I'm addicted I'm out of control
Out of control yeah

Roll of the dice
Dancing with the devil
Roll of the dice
He looks at you with his snakes eyes
Roll, roll of the dice
Roll, roll of the dice

Down and out, broke again
There goes my life down the drain
There will be a few bucks to borrow
Today I've lost so I'm winning tomorrow

Roll of the dice
Dancing with the devil
Roll of the dice
He looks at you with his snakes eyes
Roll, roll of the dice
Roll, roll of the dice
