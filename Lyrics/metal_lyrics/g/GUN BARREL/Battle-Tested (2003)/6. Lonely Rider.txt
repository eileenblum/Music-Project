[G. Feldhausen]

I'm on my way million miles from home
I'm on the run don't know where to go
Who knows where I'll be tomorrow
I have had too many sorrows
Will all the dreams that I've lost
Coming back and who can I trust
I will go home sooner or later
To write my live on a piece of paper

I'm a lonely rider
Coming home to you, alright

Now I'm here and now I'm there
I take the risk but I don't take care
A hell-raiser who broke the rules
Don't need a gun I take other tools
All you girls and all you boys
Listen to my fuckin' voice
Write my live on a piece of paper
The story of a lawbreaker

I'm a lonely rider
Coming home to you
I'm a lonely rider
I'm coming home, coming home to you

He won't stop he's a rider
Don't give it up he's a fighter
Don't you come back lonely rider
Won't you go back lonely rider

Let me walk the only way
Don't tell me that I have to stay
I waste my time too many lies
Therefore I have paid the price
Why don't you listen to my story
I'm a lonely rider but I ain't worried
At one of these days today or later
I'll write my life on a piece of paper

I'm a lonely rider
I'm coming home to you
I'm a lonely rider
Coming home to you
I'm a lonely rider
Coming home to you
I'm a lonely rider
I'm coming home, oh yeah I'm coming home
I'm coming home to you
