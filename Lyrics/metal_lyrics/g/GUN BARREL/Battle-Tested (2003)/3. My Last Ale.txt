[G. Feldhausen]

It was late at night when I was coming home
Wherever I may roam I'm always alone
I heard Old Nick calling me: My friend it's time to go
But there's something left for me that I have do

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
When I drink my last ale
I drink my last ale

I've turned the page I've closed that book of life
I'm on a crazy ride but I'm trying to survive
I'll enjoy my life till I have to go take it easy take it slow
I won't forget there's something left to do

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
When I drink my last ale
I drink my last ale

When the time has come to say good-bye
You don't have to cry
Raise your glass to the sky
Cause I will never die
Have a drink on me set the spirit free
And I will hear your call
Now the time is right for me to go
Cause that's the only way of Rock`n?Roll

Going down the wrong way it has been a hard way
That's what I have to do
Living on the edge but never going back
I'm running against the storm
And when Old Nick is calling me: My friend it's time to go
There will be something left for me to do

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
When I drink my last ale
I drink my last ale

When the time has come to say good-bye
You don't have to cry
Raise your glass to the sky
Cause I will never die
Have a drink on me set the spirit free
And I will hear your call
Now the time is right for me to go
Cause that's the only way of Rock`n?Roll
When the time is right to go
