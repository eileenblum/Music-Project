[G. Feldhausen]

Inside outside pump up the sound
And don't tell us we're too loud
Feel the power and feel the heat
Bang your head to the metal beat

Burning turning through my brain
Till it's driving me insane
Oh yeah we're breaking the chains
Shout it out we will do it again

I know you love it
We're too young to die
Don't wanna stop it
Come on enjoy your life

Death knell dance, looking for trouble
Death knell dance, come over to fight
Death knell dance, I know that you want it
Death knell dance, join in with all your might

Play it loud to reach the top
Speaker blows we'll never stop
We don't lick anybody's boots
Don't tell us what we have to do

Raise up your voices shout it out
We stand fearless we are proud
Scream it out into the night
Raise up your hands into the light

Do you love it
We're too young to die
We don't wanna stop it
Come on enjoy your life

Death knell dance, looking for trouble
Death knell dance, come over to fight
Death knell dance, I know that you want it
Death knell dance, join in with all your might
