[G. Feldhausen]

Start the show it's time for us to go
Let me hear the sound's made of steel
Heavy songs, long nights and dirty words
Play the music loud until it hurts
Going where the wind blows to the kings of Rock`n?Roll
We stand here as one together we are strong

People scream we wanna do those dirty deeds
We let them live in that belief
One for all and all for one
That's the spirit where we all belong
Let us hear your voices this is your rebel song
We stand here as one your time has come

Alright that's the way to do
We believe in nothing
Come over too
Alright that's the way to do
We believe in nothing
Come over too
Come over too, yeah

Feel the power and get to the groove
Everyone has got a heart of steel
Don't live in dread just bang your head
Round and round we'll turn the iron wheel
Going where the wind blows to the kings of Rock`n?Roll
We stand here as one together we are strong

Alright that's the way to do
We believe in nothing
Come over too
Alright that's the way to do
We believe in nothing
Come over too
Come over too, yeah

Let us hear your voices this is your rebel song
We stand here as one your time has come

Alright that's the way to do
We believe in nothing
Come over too
Alright that's the way to do
We believe in nothing
Come over too
That's the way to do
