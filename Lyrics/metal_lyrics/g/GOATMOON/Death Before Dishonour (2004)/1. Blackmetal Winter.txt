Black forest
Torches blaze
Altar of evil
Dagger of sacrifice in my hand

Black robe
Lust in my eyes
Virgin flesh
I sodomize

Black metal winter

Black night
Bowl of blood
Drink my blood
Before you die
Drink from me
You wear whore of Christ

Black snow
Beneath me
Occult moonlight
Embraces me
On this night
Of satanic winter

Black metal winter

Black goat
Come forth and see
Ritual for you is done
Bless me with your horns
Fill me with your honour!

Black metal winter
