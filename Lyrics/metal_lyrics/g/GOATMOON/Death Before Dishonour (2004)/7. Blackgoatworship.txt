Howl on the altar
Howl of blood
I wear black robe
Lucifer
I give my blood to you

I kneel before the black altar
I worship you
I kneel before my master
I hail you
I kneel before evil moon
I do this blasphemy
I kneel before inverted cross
Ave Sathanas

I sacrifice this goat
To the goat
I cut my flesh
Oh mighty lord I bleed for you
I give my life to you
