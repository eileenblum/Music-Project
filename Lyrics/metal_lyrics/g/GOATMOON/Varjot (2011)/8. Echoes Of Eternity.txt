As the frost is gone. 
I breathe the bitter wind.
And inhale the scent of spring in the breeze. 
Dimensions secret summoning. 
And beyond the rainwaters. 
Entrance of the brave to the other side. 
Depths of spirit, all embracing abyss.
In my existence, solitary.
To the ultimate reign i call.
A son of earth, I lament not.
As i face the shadowy horizon.
I clasp the earth for the last time.
Lord of the abysmal awaits.
Abhorrent eyes, beyond the border.
Beyond the stars.
Creatures of the pit, bloodless serpents.
Torment me as I scourge them.
I see horns, stronger than ever.
The cryptic energy.
The funeral gates open before me.
I thrust my sword into the multitude.
Into the paths of nature I proceed.
Lured to the darkside.
As i taste burning tears.
The signs they call me.
Fangs of the demons retreat.
And I face the archaic reality.
And my grave is in the highland.
Where my name is known. 
A fallen warrior, slave to no more pain.
In the shrine of the ancestors.
