Reflection of steel, lament of bells, sounds across the field
I am approaching the heart of esoteric twilight
Eagles beak guides my vision as i stare at the trees
Wth my hordes in fellowship of war and my blood courses cold
In fallen snow, true frost. Exalted winter
As reality is darkened in snow eclipsed with blood
I exist possessed and dreaming in my nightmare reverie, so ancient

Agony, combat zone. As rage grasps me. Demons howl, the final call
I forget my own existence in demoniac passion. I am true power
Scorching as i cut. Illuminate the winter sky
Heavenly compulsion is ruined. I am kneeling.
The wolves howl in my name. The forest screaming my name
Fallen believers around me, i have slsughtered so many of them

And i feel the warmth of fire from the burning church
And as i bequeath my soul to darkness
I am burnt with the unholy seal
The pride of my heart so black and lethal
