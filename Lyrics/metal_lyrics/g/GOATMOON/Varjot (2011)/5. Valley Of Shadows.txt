Light glares from between boughs
Feeling souls on fire
A wanderer from shores away
Birds canticle and calling of owls advice me
I crest one hill and see one thousand before me

Words fail to paint the beauty
The incomprehensible might
Following my step to the frontier
I am awake. Birds sing my name
Birds sing devotion to sun, to passion, to fidelity
Bridge by sunlight. Over tree boughs i see the wheel of sun
Living off the land
Ilust for warfare and distant homeland
Towards the northern distance and the paths unthrodden
I wait to arrive to the warriors gate
Hunting and stalking the meat
My signs i have inscribed in treetrunks

Summer's within reach and it's trailing songs
Sorcerer's invocation, i am risen to the cluster of wind
This route i have ranged once before i found
These ageless paths once before me
In my dreams, so long ago. I walk in monumental caves
Slumbering in a chasm
Spears of the great god, nature's lord
The full moons command killing by night
Veiled from mortals in incomprehensible might
