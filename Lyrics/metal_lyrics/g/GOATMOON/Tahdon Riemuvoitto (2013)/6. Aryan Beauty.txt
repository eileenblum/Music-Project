Enchanting eyes, blue like thousand crystal clear lakes
Pure pale skin, white as mighty nordic winter view
Hair, blonde like a silver forest with shapes of gold
In the last rays of the sun

Will and spirit
Of honourable and undefeated aryans
The descendant of our ancestors
From the triumphant land - Ultima Thule

No threats from foreign lands, nor the traitors of blood
Nor the keepers of values, morals and ideals of the weak
Can harm your fragile aryan beauty
In the name of our blood
I am sworn to protest you
With honour to the death
