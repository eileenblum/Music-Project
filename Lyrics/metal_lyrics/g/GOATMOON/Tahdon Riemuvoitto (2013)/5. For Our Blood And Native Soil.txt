Summer's bloom has faded away as autumn's cold wind rapes the soil
Lifeless leaves waiting on the ground for the cover of the snow 
And the ravens' caw 
Echoes in the distance

Through frosty yellow plains i walk to the forest and beyond
Under the light of north star i wander to the places of war
Last glimpse of sunset will soon be just a memory
Like the feeble screams of my dying enemies

I feel drawn to the horrifying blackness of this night 
I now see the path placed before me
The will of the triumph guides me through the terrors
And nightmares, violence and bloodshed

Northwind's quiet whisper on these fields where the battles shall be Ñlashed
We will trample our enemies with our conquering feet
Like a barbaric hymn to praise the war
The howl of whirling steel covers the suffering yells of our dying enemies

The day breaks
Swords saturated with blood
Smoke cloaks the battlefield
Reek of burnt flesh
Charred skeletons laying on the ground like frozen tree branches
To the death we will fight for our blood and native soil
