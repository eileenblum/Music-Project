Mesmerizing thin mist vicious and lethal to mortals,
Like brother to my kind,
Winter mist not to be explained by common sense,
Dancing across the trees, but soon exist no more,

Human-like shape lurking in the misty woods,
Hunted by fearful men with their spears and torches,
The forest as my mother, my father,
I was born from the womb of the forest,

Not weapons, not flames can hurt me, I am immortal, as the winter ends it is time for my slumber, but as the ground turns white again the mortals fear arises, the white beast into the immortals winter
