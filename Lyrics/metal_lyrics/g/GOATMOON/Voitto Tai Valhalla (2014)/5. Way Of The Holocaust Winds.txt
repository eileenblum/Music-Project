The future is grim, unclear
Unhonourable, incapable to survive
Tolerant to wrongness
Bonds of blood meaningless
This must change

Subhumans try to rule this world
But with honor we fight against it all
Out in numbers we are
But still we are strong and stand tall

Hell we must raise
The gods of war we must praise
With raging storm of steel
And with the burning winds
Of holocaust
This world must be cleansed

Salvation through flames
Modern world must burn
Only the strong will survive
It's time the scum to learn

On the wings of an iron eagle
The new triumphant Aryan imperium
Rises from the ashes of this decadent world
