In an age of honour steel and stars
The tough Hyperborean half-beast half-man
Clad with skin of wolf scent of blood in the air
Conjuring solstice night barbarian fires
To Grom to Odin to war fathers

The archaic shadows on the mountain
Heard him provided counsel
Glory of the darkside
An oath was sworn of agony and triumph
Of blasphemous strong deeds
Southward he sailed towards magic forests
Bound by his oath wrapped in fog
Where exist frozen tears and mystic consciousness
In his veins the bloodlust still burning
He didn't let it die what I am if not a man
Survived the battles of the past

From the deep black woodland under autumn leaves
And whispering shadows we were grown fearless and wise
Descendants of heroes our clans become hordes united northern tribes
The Aryan pagan frontier banners fly under moonlit sky for a thousand years

Race of heroes race of kings â for the sons of wolves the snowland sings
Race of heroes â from ancient times blasphemy and destiny
Night shrouds our crimes

When traitors allied with wrong bloodlines listened to deceiving voices
Buried our dreams profaned our temples abandoned our fortresses
Infiltrated by scum by southern mutant breeds
The earth and sky you heard our war cries â we are the race of heroes

We are the Hyperborean race we won't let it die
We still have the gates within us
To the memories we lost, to the secret paths

Race of heroes, race of kings â love and hate between mind and fist
Race of heroes from ancient times â by fire and night, we are ready to fight
