DISTANT LAKE LOOKS SO CALM 
JUST HIDING SOMETHING MORBID
LUST FOR VENGEANCE IS LOOKING FOR IT'S TARGET
ONLY TWO THINGS THAT PENETRATE THE DARKNESS
THE LIGHT OF THE MOON 
AND THE FLASH OF THE BLADE

HEAVY BREATH OF THE KILLER 
AND THE SCREAMS OF THE YOUTH
PROVIDE THE ULTIMATE SOUNDTRACK FOR THE NIGHT
SOME TRY TO RUN, SOME START TO WHIMPER
SOME FIGHT BACK YET NO ONE SURVIVES

MASSACRE
MURDERS UNDER THE BANNER OF GOAT
DEATH 
SLASHING THEIR LIFES FOR THE GLORY OF SATAN

FACELESS IS THE EVIL AND COLD IS THE STEEL
CUTTING FLES AND CRUSHING THE BONE
BLIND RAGE ERUPTS AT THE TIME OF SAMHAIN
FOR THE OLD GODS OF DARKNESS RETURN

YOUTH GATHERED HERE FOR ONLY ONE PURPOSE
TO DONATE THEIR BLOOD FOR THE WICKED
WHEN THE OLD OWL FLIES LOW 
AS THE OCTOBER FALLS
BEHOLD THE REVENGE OF THE DEAD
