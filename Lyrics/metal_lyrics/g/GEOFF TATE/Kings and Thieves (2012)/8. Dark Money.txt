It's getting stronger
Can't wait any longer
They woke the beast from sleeping
Now how the quicksand deepens
Better get up, get off your knees!

Open eyes will see
See it?

Throw down the gauntlet
Let go of the tourniquet
We've seen the bleeding deceivers
And the hemorrhaging believers

Take the money, take your soul
It's time for heads to roll!
Oh, I can feel it, feel it!

They've stepped over the line
One too many times now...
They're gonna feel it
They're gonna feel it

In spray paint verses
It's written everywhere
The rich will lie and say they care
As the middle class pays the lion's share

Follow the money
Watch where it goes

It's what you've always known

Can you see it?
Can you see it?

They've stepped over the line
For the last time now...
They're gonna feel it

Dark money runs the president
Dark money fuels the government
Dark money is the way it's done
Dark money will determine who has won
Dark money -- everywhere you turn
Dark money has no concern
Dark money -- and we wonder where it ends
It never ends
It never ends
It never ends
It never ends

We're Wi-Fi connected
And those elected
Must follow demands of what the masses say
And play the game by the rules of today

Retribution is at hand

We've see it all
We've see it all
Can you see it?
Can you see it?

They've stepped over the line
Can you see it?
Over the line
Can you see it?
One too many times now...
Can you see it?

Dark money runs the president
Dark money fuels the government
Dark money is the way it's done
Dark money will determine who has won
