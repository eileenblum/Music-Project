There is a simple purpose to my life.
And there is a meaning that will complete me
in time.
There is a mountain of opinion,
telling me that my time could be better spent.
There are complicated circumstances.
They say you belong to a better man.

Baby you're mine.
Yeah you're mine, you just don't know it yet.

Now when I'm right beside you do you ever see...
Do you see me?
And when I'm so deep inside you
will you know,
ever know me?

And when I move in you?
And I do all of those things that you want me to?
You're my world, I'm your satellite,
always free floating outside of your gravity.

When my finger tips touch your skin,
you will know.
When I whisper your secret sins
you will know.
When my finger tips touch your skin,
you will know.
When I whisper when I whisper your...
I whisper your name.

When my finger tips touch your skin,
you will know.
When I whisper your secret sins...

Baby you're mine. All mine.
