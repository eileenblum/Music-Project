With a grain of faith,
they say you can move a mountain.
And from the crater made,
your dreams will flood like from a fountain.

This is my life,
what I raise my hand for.
This is what I...
what I stand for.

What gets your through the day?
What is your savior?
Faith soul faith,
there is no failure.

This is what I...
what I raise my hand for.
This is what I...
what I stand for.

With a grain of faith.
With a grain of faith.
With a grain of faith.
With faith...
you can move a mountain.

This is life...
what I raise my hand for.
This is life...
what I raise my hand...
This is life...
what I raise my hand...
What I...
What I stand for.
