"Jump in." She says.
"High tide." Yeah she promises.
"Dive under." She says.
Raging water. She gives to me.

So still and silent.
Holding breath, close my eyes
and take her hand.
Feel my body surrender,
who wants to live forever?
My feet can't touch the ground.

Should I swim for the shore?
Should I sink into the black?
Should I breathe now?
Would you?

"Jump in." She said.
"Dive deeper you can rest all day tomorrow."
"Hold on longer." She begs.
"It's getting stronger." Remember?

Should I swim for the shore?
Should I sink into the black?
Should I breathe now?
Should I breathe my last breath?

Should I swim for the shore?
Should I sink into the black?
Should I breathe now?
Should I breathe my last breath now?
Who wants to live forever?

Pull me down.
Who wants to live forever?
Pull me under.
Who wants to live forever?

Pull me down.
Who wants to live forever?
Pull me under.
Who wants to live forever?
