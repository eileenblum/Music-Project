I should have had you,
I should have had you over last night.
We could have talked about the things
that mattered to you.
I should have seen this.
I should have seen the color of your eyes
but I was somewhere else
or I was looking though you.

Are you feeling helpless?
Are you feeling selfish?
Or are you feeling anything at all?
Are you seeing something?
Am I close to nothing?
Will I ever be the one you want to call?

Now I'm going down.
I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

Now you're over me.
And there's nothing I can say to bring you down.
Now you're over me,
now you're over my head.
And you're never coming back to me are you?

I should have had you,
I should have had you over last night.
We could have talked about the things
that mattered to you.
I should have seen this.
I should have seen this coming...
this coming.

Now I'm going down.
I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

Now you're over me.
And there's nothing I can say to bring you down again.
Now you're over me.
You're somewhere over my over my head.
Over my head.
Now you're over me.
Now you're over my head.
And you're never coming back to me are you?

Now you're over...
Now you're over...
Now you're over me.
