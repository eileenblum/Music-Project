World of chaos for us to bear
Fall of mankind all life shall end
World in terror
No salvation - united we fade
Death's the curse of man to wither and die
Darkness swarms around us with a blessing from hell
Day by day we blindly fight and no one shall rise
A great becoming the final end of human race

End of days - coming the storm
Challenging mankind - in a violent form

Demise of man, earth and all existence
In a dark funeral

Lies, and madness now damn us all
Kill for pleasure, another death
Another war to save the day, obey (and) fall prey
We feel what is to come No species will be spared
