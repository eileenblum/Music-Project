When might is right
Weakness shall be no more
Heresy to dominate
Angels of heaven writhing in fire
When might is right
The Promised Land stands in flames
When silence rings
Annihilation has begun

Death descends from the sky
Death arrives from the sea
Death shall come to erase the weak
Death shall come to cleanse the world

Sammael, Shiva, Sammael, come forth

Cast thy judgement on the weakest of races
Sammael curse them with venomous hate
Shiva destroyeth the plague of them feeble
Serpentine fire - Alla Xul Kanpa

Death descends from the sky
Death arrives from the sea
Death shall come to erase the weak
Death shall come to cleanse the world

Sammael, Shiva, Sammael, come forth

Cast thy judgement on the weakest of races
Sammael curse them with venomous hate
Shiva destroyeth the plague of them feeble
Serpentine fire - Alla Xul Kanpa

When hatred is unleashed
Religions shall be no more
When dogmas fall to ruin
Churches of heaven turning to ashes
When might is right
Hear the sound of the war-machine
Holy wars for holy gods
A manifestation for foolish endeavours
