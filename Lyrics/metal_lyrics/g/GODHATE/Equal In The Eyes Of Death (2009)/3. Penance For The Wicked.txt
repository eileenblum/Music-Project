"Confess my child", a priest is in command
Empowered - by their holy congregation
"You will not be saved until you shared your sins"
So let him do, let him enjoy through your confession
"Kiss the cross and use your tongue,
Let your father feel a little bit of your dirt"
By the presence of god he revels in her sins
Tears of regret are now the tears of hate

"You are forgiven, isn't it great?"
Back to the empty, the fear and the same
But heaven is silent and god isn't near
Father confessor your mind rape's a shame

Accepting punishment, still feeling shame
It's the penance for the wicked
Indulging in prayers and left in wonder
Why does this god hate me so?

Accepting punishment, still feeling shame
It's the penance for the wicked
Indulging in prayers and left in wonder
They forced you to concede

Confess my child", but nothing will change
What's done is done better stick to your guns
Owned a ticket to heaven but they stole it away
Revenge on the father who made life a hell
He's the abuser they warned you about
Sucking on his fingers with a fist up his ass
Listening in awe and wanting to be
He'll cum in the heavens and he'll cum for his faith
