No forgiveness, no fucking absolution
No redemption, no apology will change the course
Suffering in daily punishment
With a broken heart serenity forever denied

Hand in hand with unfortune I stand
Always the same loosing the game
Born to this place all without grace
Distorting what's real can't you see what I feel

No forgiveness, no fucking absolution
No redemption, no apology will change the course
No compassion, malicious revelation
Evil unfold, no fucking bullshit shall cramp me now

I am mad at a world of shit
I'm in anger with this pitiful life

Condemned from the start stripped of my heart
Pushed to the shade for the mistakes I've made
A second chance - denied, all the good now has died
No pity I've felt for the things that I've dealt

I am mad at a world of shit
I'm in anger with this pitiful life
I hate everything, I rise in scornful pain
I rise in furious anger with hate upon you all
I hate everything, I rise in scornful pain
I rise in furious anger with hate upon you all
I hate everything, I rise in scornful pain
I rise in furious anger with hate upon you all
