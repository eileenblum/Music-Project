I question all your laws
I question all your rules
You fool, shall not bind me to your fake gods

You say we're equal...
But I know you're lying

You live in self-denial,
I can see through it all
Godsend with hate, Lamb of God, I won't believe

You say we're equal...
(If I become "like you")

Equal in the eyes of god
When you're the judge
Equal's just a word for your conceit

I question all your words
I question gods and man
The things has no longer a meaning to my fate

You say we're equal...
But I know you're lying

Crumbled idols
Mouldered books
Broken friendships
How does this evil prove the good with god?

You say we're equal...
(If I become like you)

Equal in the eyes of god
When you're the judge
I pledge to blasphemy
Are you the outmost will of god?
(A wolf) in sheep's array?
On our final day
Are we equal in the eyes of death?
