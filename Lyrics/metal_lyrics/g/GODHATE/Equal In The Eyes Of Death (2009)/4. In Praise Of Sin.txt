In praise of sin I spread my wings
Follow me and you will see
a world of dark delights
Forbidden fruits for you and me
In temple Flesh I bear the mark
Love and joy, make your choice
Shame for one, honours another
Young and old - now sing with me

I am evil
I am chaos
I who live in sin
I am evil
I am chaos
I be blessed who lives in sin

In praise of sin, I am divine
Flames of hell burns higher
I must admit, I sometimes bend
for the demon in me
In my paradise,
are we not all but sinners?
Without regret for the self
Yes! Now sing with me!

I am evil
I am chaos
I who live in sin
I am evil
I am chaos
I be blessed who lives in sin

I plead guilty, hang me high
I indulge in sin
In the name of dirt
I raise the horns for liberty

By my pride I rise infernal
I take of what I wish
No shame for my desires
I choose this life of sin

In my paradise,
Are we not all but sinners?
Without regret for the self
Yes! Now sing with me!
