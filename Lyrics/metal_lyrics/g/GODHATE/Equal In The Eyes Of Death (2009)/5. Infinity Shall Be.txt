Into the void, into another lie, it's just another waste of breath
Splendid ways of the strong, I must seek the strength inside

I cry out, anger canalized
Seek the perfect, infinity shall be
Hesitate not, the devil is in me
Let out the ancient tongues of hell

Enemy of the self, an unclean spirit of the waste, annihilate, annihilate
Feel the urge of the potent will. Fear not â I will not serve to anyone but myself

I cry out, anger canalized
Seek the perfect, infinity shall be
Hesitate not, the devil is in me
Let out the ancient tongues - raise up thy might

Oh morning star lead me on, take me to dimensions higher
Scorn me here, stab me there, I don't care for nothing hurts
Chaos-me rages inside, revolt with sword in hand
Leave emotions out of here; fuck me I'll never fall!

Chaos-me rages inside, revolt with sword in hand
Leave emotions out of here; fuck me I'll never fall!

In nothingness, for the heathen reign, untouchable in purest form
I seek thee might beyond all ends, collecting worlds that shall be mine
