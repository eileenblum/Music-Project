Pathetic lies spewing from their hearts
A plague of weakness kept alive for too long
It's consuming and killing the people
Searching for cure in a god of the waste
Praying to idols so old and rotten
I, the snake, let me offer alternatives

Celebrate, the majestic self â Antichristianity
This is my unreligion â Antichristianity

Hereby I present a new age
An era of darkness to swallow the false
Blessed be thee who speaks with tongues of fire
Trample the cross and Crumble the corpse
blaspheme the old, let nothing stop you
Open the gates to self preservation
Unfold in liberty

Death to god, death to Jesus
Put an end to their miserable world
Death to god, death to Jesus
We are as mighty as gods
Death to god, death to Jesus
Put an end to their miserable world
Death to god, death to Jesus
We are as mighty as any of gods
