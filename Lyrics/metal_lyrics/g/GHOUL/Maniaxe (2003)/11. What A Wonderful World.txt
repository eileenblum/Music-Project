I see towers of flame, and corpses too
I see the doom, of me and you
And I think to myself.... what a wonderful world.
I see skies obscured, I see no light
Dark freezing days, dark sleepless nights
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world.
The clouds of radiation are so pretty in the sky
Tumours on the faces of the people who survived
I see friends in the past kill each other for food
They're really starving......So will you.
I see babies die, I watch them decompose
They'll hurt much more, than I'll never know
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world
