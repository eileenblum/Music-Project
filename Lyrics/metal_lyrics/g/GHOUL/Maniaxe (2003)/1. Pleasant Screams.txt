Greetings from the home of Death
A place devoid of hope
Where sanity and reason twitch
Upon the hangman's rope
Greetings from a nightmare
From a place that should not be
Where spirits congregate
In ectoplasmic revery
Welcome to our town
You just may find it suits your tastes
Until you feel the Reaper's
Clammy breath upon your face
Welcome to our home
And tell yourself it's just a dream
It's time for you to die now
So enjoy, and pleasant screams
MANIAXE
