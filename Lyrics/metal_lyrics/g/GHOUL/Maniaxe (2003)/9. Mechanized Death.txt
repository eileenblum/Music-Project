Alone in his castle the Ghoul Hunter toils,
Devising a plan to destroy
Feverishly working on a monstrous creation
A man of mechanix to cause devastation
Gears are adjusted for inhuman power
Ten feet tall; a wrought iron tower
Death he can bring with a squeeze of his claw,
Electrified net, or retractable saw
-Killbot is online-All systems go
-Tell me my orders but tell me them slow
"Go to the graveyard and flush out the Ghouls"
"Plunder the catacombs! Murder the fools!"
We saw him coming, he couldn't be missed
We tried to act brave but our pants were all pissed
He destroyed everything with no delay
Smashed every villager stuck in his way
(round)
Glowing laser eyes
Controlled by Gammalite
Crushing through tunnels and smashing through walls
Programmed for vengeance with deadly protocols
Iron ignoramous, mechanical sap
We four got together and set him a trap
We lured him right into a cage
And hacked away at his wiring with an axe
"Return to Castle" flashed in digital
As he lurched forward on a counter-attack
He shambled and twitched to the Ghoul Hunter's lair
And stomped through the drawbridge as if it weren't there
He flailed in a rampage, everything was pulverized
The castle walls began to crumble; he was trapped inside
Curses from the Ghoul Hunter were echoing within
As brick and mortar covered his ungodly creation
