I woke, I awoke in the night from a terrible dream
A crystal skull caught in a frozen scream
It was calling me, mon, calling me to a distant land
There was hooded mutants and a mon with metal hand
I'll board a ship and I will cross the sea
I'm the houngan priest, the houngan priest called Samedi
Baron Samedi
