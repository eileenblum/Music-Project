Guzzling the rot gut
Binging on the putrefied swill
Total fucking mind rot
Blind drunk and I'm dying to kill
So fucking loaded I can't get off the floor
Three sheets are to the wind and I'm going for four
I'm a total wreck, gotta lay off the booze
And on top of that, I can't find my shoes
But what can you do?
Gutbucket Blues!!!
Waking in a cold sweat
Feels like I need a new brain
Overdid the Rot Gut
And now I'm in incredible pain
Retching up the effluvial brews
Cursing my existence through a river of spew
Fishy smelling bile to recycle and use
And I could really use a drink when I'm through
But what can you do?
Gutbucket Blues!!!
