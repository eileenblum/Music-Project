Whispering voices in darkness
Their footsteps were really quite loud
They came for a skull made of crystal
They'll leave in a burial shroud
Gathering in the graveyard
A cult and a secret cabal
They'll search every inch of the catacombs
Kill them all, kill them all!!!!!
Peel their skin
Put the knife in
Burn them without and then burn them within!
Polish the headbone and try not to scratch it
Turn them to Rot Gut
Bury the hatchet!
Torches arranged in a circle
Bathing the cultists in light
We crept through the shadows
Trying to hear them and stay out of sight
They spoke of a power contained in the skull
They said, it was brought from the stars
That thing we'd been using to crack open walnuts
Used to crack walnuts on mars?
Peel their skin
Put the knife in
Burn them without and then burn them within!
Polish the headbone and try not to scratch it
Turn them to Rot Gut
Bury the hatchet!
We broke up the party with a Molotov blast
They turned into human torches when we doused them in gas
The screaming was loud it would get louder still
As I slit their bellies open in my frenzy to kill
Axes shattered vertebrae, spinal fluid squirts
Cleavers entered craniums, ruining white shirts
Burning eyeballs guttering and cooling into clots
Being hung by their intestines had them tied up in knots
Skin was pulled from muscle and devoured on the spot
Cult members dying and left there to rot
Some of them made it, I'm sorry to say
Next time they come here we will find a way to
Bury the hatchet!
Victims decaying in the darkness
Their screaming was really quite loud
They came for a skull made of crystal
They left in a burial shroud
Moldering in the graveyard
Their bones will be nibbled by rats
If they're going to steal the crystalline skull
They'll have to do better than that
Peel their skin
Put the knife in
Burn them without and then burn them within!
Polish the headbone and try not to scratch it
Turn them to Rot Gut
Bury the hatchet!
