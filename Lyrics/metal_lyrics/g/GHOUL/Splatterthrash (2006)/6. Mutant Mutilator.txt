Reject, the king of the nerds
Treated like a social disease
Cast out, he was a slovenly twerp
Heavy Metal was his only release
Picked on, he got a beating a day
While everybody looked the other way
Headcase, living in a fantasy world
His nerves were starting to fray
Comic books! Vacant looks! Brain sick! Horror flicks!
Schools out, and the bullies await
Little Billy was gonna get trashed
Headlock, and a punch in the gut
They tore up his homework and his glasses were smashed
Graveyard, Billy ran there to hide
And he fell into the tunnels below
Darkness, and then a light from the void
For eons in slumber, the skull, now, aglow
Mutate! To Mutilate! Transform! Gore Boar!
Muscles ripping through his clothes
A snout where there was once a nose
Wiry matted hair
Studded denim outerwear
Beware!!!
They begged for their lives when they saw him
He made them beg him some more
He cut off their heads and he tore them to shreds
On the Satanic night of the bloodthirsty boar
Watch out! He's the Mutant Mutilator!
Cry out! He's the Mutant Mutilator!
Mutated were-boar berserker
The rampaging hell-beast attacks
His foes are left mangled and bloody
By hoof and by fist and by tusk and by axe!
Watch out! He's the Mutant Mutilator!
Cry out! He's the Mutant Mutilator!
Scream out! He's the Mutant Mutilator!
Daybreak, and the nerd was awake
I guess it must have been a dream
Bloodcaked, he staggered out of his bed
Looked in the mirror and he let out a scream
Death's head was lying on his bed
And it was oozing ectoplasmic goo
No choice, to the Curio shoppe
Old Mr. Fang yeah he'll know what to do
