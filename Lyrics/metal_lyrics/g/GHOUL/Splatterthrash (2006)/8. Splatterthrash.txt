Nightfall, and you head to the show
A ticket is clutched in your hand
Wearing a vest made of denim
With patches of your favorite bands
You get to the club
And the first band is totally lame
These posers are into the nu-school
They have t-i-o-n in their name!
Our riffs decapitate them, our solos shred their skin
My drums obliterate them, let the massacre begin!!!
Up from the pit
We launch an assault on the stage
Hatchets are buried in craniums
In a frenzy of psychotic rage
Killing machines
Necks are all broken and slashed
We came here to conquer, we came here to rule
WE CAME HERE TO SPLATTERTHRASH!!!!!
Our riffs decapitate them, our solos shred their skin
My drums obliterate them, let the massacre begin!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! BANG YOUR FUCKING HEAD!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! SLAY THE LIVING, EAT THE DEAD!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! MOSHING LIKE A FOOL!!!
SPLATTERTHRASH!!! LIVE FOR METAL, DIE FOR GHOUL!!!
End of the show
And on to the next shitty dive
The scenesters who got on the guest list
Paid with their poserish lives
But you survived
Your metal turned out to be True
You slammed in the pit and you didn't take shit
A Numbskull, through and through
Our riffs decapitate them, our solos shred their skin
My drums obliterate them, let the massacre begin!!!
