Born to a whore on a Parisian floor
In the ides of march, a babe to abhor
Pardon my French, but life really sucked
When you're born and grow up an ugly duck
To the smiths to work my mother bade me
But play with the fire and you'll get burnt, you see
For after the boss gave me a beating
I lit up the kiln to blow up everything
Merde!
Villagers threw stones at the sight they saw
A crispy pyromaniac with no lower jaw
For this curse of life, I got my revenge
Burning all Europe from Rome to Stonehenge
Then one day I wandered to a most depressing place
Creepsylvania!!! With no food for my face
Alone in a grave, I thought that was it
Till two hooded ghouls came to steal all my shit
This ones alive the chunky one said
Give him my grog and they tipped back my head
That is Fermentor heres meat to gnosh
Hey Digestor lets teach him to mosh!!!
They asked me join 'em and gave me an axe
Then we added Dissector, it was on Maniaxe
And with my friends help, I'll torch every fool
Cremator burns all in the name of Ghoul!!!!
Merde!!!!
