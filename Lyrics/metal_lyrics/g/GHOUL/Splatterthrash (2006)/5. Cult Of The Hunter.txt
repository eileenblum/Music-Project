Up in the Volkov mountains
In the rubble of the Ghoul hunter's home
A monster of metal lies buried
Under ten thousand tons of stone
To wield a weapon so powerful
Its owner would conquer and rule
The cult leader plans reactivate
That killbot should decimate Ghoul
Exhuming the robot, the members all gasped
The killbot was buried alone
They only found remains of a skeletal arm
A boulder was crushing the bone
The mechanized man was in pieces
Its brain all but rotten away
An arm had gone missing, its optics torn out
Its load pan was in disarray
The cult leader lifted a black iron claw
His eyes were all red and aglow
They gathered the wreckage of killbot
And marched to the valley below
New weapons were built for the robot
Rebuilt to be stronger than all
And when killbot was put back together
Walt Disney's brain was thawed for install
Cult of the hunter
