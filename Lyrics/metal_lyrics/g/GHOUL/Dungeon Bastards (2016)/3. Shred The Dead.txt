Baron Samedi's commands to retrieve the Omicron Bomb fall on deaf ears, as Ghoul retreats deeper into the Catacombs muttering half-hearted assurances; that is, until Samedi unleashes an army of revivified corpses to persuade them otherwise.

Black dread, undead
Crawling from the crypts
Ragged claws scratch coffin lids
A rancid stink as tombs emit
Tongues slick over glutinous lips
With blood lust in their minds
We grab our decks and grab our dicks
Drop in and bust a grind

Smash our boards into the undead hoards
The rotten fiends are gored... Shred the Dead
Mushed up guts are stuck all in our trucks
But we don't give a fuck... Shred the Dead

One-eyed wallride
Drunken mutants shred the gnar
Collapsing clotted craniums
With kick-flips eldritch and bizarre
Unfazed by the fusillade
Blitzkrieg from the dead brigade
They'll never stop until we die
So send them back into the grave

Smash our boards into the undead hoards
The rotten fiends are gored... Shred the Dead
Mushed up guts are stuck all in our trucks
But we don't give a fuck... Shred the Dead

We launch into the fray with rusty axes set to "slay"
And shatter each and every vertebrae
McTwist was missed, busted ankle, broken wrist
Dentures cracked as concrete's kissed

Crash the swarm of wretched shambling forms
Ripened limbs are torn... Shred the Dead
Maggots creamed as mildewed skulls are reamed
And every cube is gleamed... Shred the Dead
Backs to the Wall against the undead thrall
So let's just kill 'em all... Shred the Dead
Clouds of flies as bodies pile up high
And our escape is nigh... Shred the Dead
