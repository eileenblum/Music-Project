This crowd is the worst
Outcast debased into something perverse

It's time to unrest,
so, put down your crawl and sharpen your vest

We are Ghoulunatics!
The cannibals gathered to shout it out loud
We are Ghoulunatics!
Violence is promised and vengeance is vowed

Biting our style, hooded and drunk
With an odor so vile

"Dubrenkin mest fall"
A misspelled graffiti is smeared on the wall

We are Ghoulunatics!
Taking a stand with our fist in the air
We are Ghoulunatics!
They think we're their pals
but we really don't care

Go!

Fight 'til you die!
Fight 'til you die!

We are Ghoulunatics!
Pantaloons sodden and skulls benumbed
We are Ghoulunatics!
Easily led 'cause they're so fucking dumb

We are Ghoulunatics!
An army of losers, the worst of the worst
We are Ghoulunatics!
They'll march to our orders and buy all our merch
