Driven from the city and into the graveyard, the fleeing hordes of indigent peasants are pursued by acidthrower wielding gangs of shock troops. The shrieks of melting villagers fill the freezing air. Down in the catacombs, oblivious, Ghoul tucks in to dinner.

Pandemonium rattled the crypts
Tunnels corroded in acidulous drips
A ruckus interrupting our daily dead
As the villagers fled with acid melting their heads
Weakening stanchions, savage assault
The bodies were piled into a burial vault
There was a terrible cave-in, crushing debris
What came through the ceiling brought us right to our knees

A massive contrivance enveloped in bones
Cradled in death upon a sinister throne

Clad in iron, oxidized
Buried for years away from curious eyes
A circle emblazoned on its riveted skin
And an ominous glow illuminating within
Omicron prototype 77-Y if found, pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye
Samedi stiffened and his lips were atwitch
As a mysterious hum achieved a deafening pitch

A massive contrivance enveloped in bone
Cradled in death upon a sinister throne
As if to intone...

I am the bringer of war
Atomic death forevermore
I am the bringer of war
Behold the fury of my roar

Trapped in a reverie, the voodoo man fell
He dreamed of salvation through nuclear hell
Omicron energy to shatter the spell
And the vaporization of his corporeal shell

Stun grenades from the bully brigade
Elbows and knuckles in a violent raid
We bloodied our boots as we battled the brutes
But they netted the bomb, so all the effort was moot
Beaten down, we had to retreat
Samedi seething at our tragic defeat
A radio crackled the weapon is seized
Our hackles were raised as the Commandant wheezed

Flee from my legions, pitiful fools!
There's nowhere to hide now, this is the end of Ghoul!
Scuttle to safety like pestilent rats
The fuse is burning quickly now that...

I am the bringer of war
Atomic death forevermore
I am the bringer of war
Behold the fury of my roar
