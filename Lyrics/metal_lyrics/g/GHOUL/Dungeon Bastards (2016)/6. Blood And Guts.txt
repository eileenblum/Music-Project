Deep in the bowels of an edifice, foul 
The wretched dregs of the ghetto corralled 
Covert experiments mutating forms 
And violating every ethical norm 

I, Dr. Zongo, master of my trade 
Employing Super Science to make an army of slaves 
You will be servile, and you will obey 
You will sit and you will stay! 

Ragged wounds leaking virulent pus 
Stapled flesh where the guillotine cut 

Tubes pulse with chemical brews 
Cervical vertebrae are grotesquely fused 
On the slab, a chimerical mutt 
A concatenation of Blood &amp; Guts 

Bow to the whip hand, and bow to the fist 
The feral creations were deservedly pissed 
The doctor screamed as their manacles snapped 
Dragged off to his doom as his skivvies were crapped 

Deep in the bowels of an edifice, foul 
A wretched freak is emitting a howl 

On the slab, a chimerical mutt 
A concatenation of Blood &amp; Guts 
On the slab you are nothing but 
A concatenation of Blood &amp; Guts 
On the slab, a chimerical mutt 
A concatenation of Blood &amp; Guts 
On the slab you are nothing but 
A concatenation of Blood &amp; Guts
