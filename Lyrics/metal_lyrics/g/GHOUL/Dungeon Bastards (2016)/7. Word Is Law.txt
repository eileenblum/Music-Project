Commandant Dobrunkum struts and preens in his headquarters high above the city as he watches the bedraggled slave force hang the Omicron Bomb from the iron hand of his gargantuan effigy. He is the master of all he surveys, and his...

In Creepsylvania, I drafted this piece of paper

I'm leather-clad, motherfucker, super-bad
You see me coming, better bow down
The severed head of Kreeg now issues orders from me
To all the cannibals that hung around

Hail Creepsylvania
Hail me!
Tremble with awe
Because my word is law

I am the bomb, I've got the bomb, and with aplomb
Over the comms my voice addresses you fools

Any peasants, or protesters, or Ghouls
I've got the soldiers, got the power, got the odor
Of the modern Creepsylvanian man
If they step to Dobrunkum then you know I'm gonna punk 'em
With my nightstick in the back of the van

Hail Creepsylvania
Hail me!
Tremble with awe
Because my word is law

Because my word is law

Hail Creepsylvania
Hail me!
Tremble with awe
Because my word is law
