let me introduce you to a very special fiend
a twisted hunchback with stringy white hair
peddler of curios and Ghoul benefactor
at a dusty little place down the road
from our lair

his name is of no concern
but his wares are of particular interest
he sells the most peculiar oddities
its a wonder that his store stays in business

welcome to my shop,
my little home away from home
take a look around if you dare
I have trinkets to amuse, artifacts to peruse
curiosities to horrify and scare
horned human skulls,
cursed Egyptian scrolls
a puzzle box that causes lamentation
a cursed monkeys paw
and a crucifix that bleeds
part and parcel of my curious vocation

cobweb veils stretch across the room
and obscure switch carved from a bone
a pull of the lever and the floor opens up
revealing the ostium that leads to our home
Creepsylvania is where they all go
from our bone riddled dungeon of Horror
to a shop specializing in creepy curios

welcome to my shop,
my little home away from home
take a look around if you dare
I have trinkets to amuse, artifacts to peruse
curiosities to horrify and scare
horned human skulls,
cursed Egyptian scrolls
a puzzle box that causes lamentation
a cursed monkeys paw
and a crucifix that bleeds
part and parcel of my curious vocation

Coffins,
Coffins,
Coffins,
Coffins and Curios
