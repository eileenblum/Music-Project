I'll take all the guts from a rotten old stiff
and choose what I want with a taste or a whiff
pack them in jars and infuse them with yeast
to brew up a batch for the next midnight feast
my skill as a brewer has never been met
severed head '87 is my best vintage yet
we drink till we're knackered on putrefied pus
a chaser of lymph really gives me a rush

Rot Gut
despoiling the dead for a high
Rot Gut
a quart of blood for a quart of rye
Rot Gut
brandy from bile makes a killer flambe
Rot Gut
a jigger of rot gut makes my day

my moonshine goes with any dish
and makes belches taste like rancid fish
hot lung-buttered rum is my specialty du jour
and an excellent rot gut hangover cure

Rot Gut
despoiling the dead for a high
Rot Gut
a quart of blood for a quart of rye
Rot Gut
brandy from bile makes a killer flambe'
Rot Gut
a jigger of rot gut makes my day

my cup runneth over
bile gurgles down my throat
a beer bong of unraveled guts
spills over with a suet-beer float

a carton of booze made from rancid secretions
public hair garnish, the finishing touch
vittreous vino, we heartily glug
but we'd never use alcohol as a crutch

ROT GUT !!!!!
