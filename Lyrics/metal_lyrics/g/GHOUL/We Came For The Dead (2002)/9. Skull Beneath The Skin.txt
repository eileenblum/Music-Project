Mean and infectious
The evil prophets rise
Dance of the macabre
As witches streak the sky
Decadent worship
Of black magic and sorcery
In the womb of the devil's dungeon
Trapped without a plea

See thing in agony
Necrosis is the fate
Pins sticking through the skin
The venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory
Nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life
But no one hears a sound

Help me!

Prepare the patient's scalp
To peel away
Metal caps his ears
He'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor
Riveted 'cross his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws
So no one hears his cries

The skull beneath the skin

The skull beneath the skin
Now you're drawn and quartered
Your bones will make the X
Symbol stands for poison
And it's chained to your head
As we fold your arms
To make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix
Religion has been lost

The skull beneath this skin
The skull beneath this skin

The skull beneath this skin
