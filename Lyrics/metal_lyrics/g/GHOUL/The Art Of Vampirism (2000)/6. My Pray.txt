Luna, Diana, Hecate..
Mother trinity, Nocturnal Supremacy
Thou who shine in the darkness
make lighter the way to us
your creature, Haunters of the dark
your lovers and daughters
Give me your stremght.... your charm...
your blood...your obscure power
Luna
give me the power of the skies
the sight in the dark, the blood of the vampire
Diana
give me the power of the earth
the hypnosis of your glance your bewitching voice
Hecate
give me your occult power
the control over the infernal beings
the domain of the elements
I feel you... now it's the time
oh Mother.... I hail for you come
Magna Mater, Primordial Woman
Mater Succubus, of all the Vampires
had my blood poured for you
may I have just a drop of yours
Thou athirst of blood. Gelid fear, Gorgo, Mormo;
Moon of the thousand faces
cast a glance at my sacrifice
Ave et Gloria, Mater.... Mater Mea.
