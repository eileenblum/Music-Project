After the sun descendance,
when the shadows of the cemetery cross
is bound to the obscurity
No more children's snicker, no more games...
everybody's afraid of the Lady in Black...
Once mortal virgin, now an un-dead creature
wake up in your grave
and arise from your death,
innocent corrupted soul, you feed yourself with blood
pure children slaughtered by Lady in Black
With the light of the torches for company
four men came for her
flowers scattered on a maiden grave
they met the eyes of the creature of Hell
They were the eyes of the beloved,
for shape and color
but the eyes were filled with the fire of Hell
She was coming nearer with a
languish grace, then She said:
"Come, my lover, leave the other and come to me.
My arms, they desire you.
Come we will lay together.
Come, my groom, Come!"
But the husband arms killed her and then
he kissed Her with the tenderness of a lover
His tears swept away the filth from Her body
and soul. A salvation for a creature
of Hell
No more children's snicker, no more games...
everybody's afraid of the Lady in Black...
"No longer She will be an un-dead of Evil.
She's a true dead of God, and Her soul is with Him!"
