Overloaded with power, the transmission destroys the minds of the hapless townsfolk, sending them headlong into a mindless orgy of consumption... 

Tooth and Claw 

Ravenous bloodlust 
Consumed by a sickening urge 
Hunger gnaws at bloated guts 
Compulsively driven to binge and purge 
Chunks of chewed up tongue are puked 
From salivating jaws 
Autophagous bacchanal of mutilated flesh 
Red in tooth and claw 

Tooth and claw! 

Skin is flayed with razor blades 
Appendages chewed down to stumps 
Gulping down flesh with a gurgulating belch 
Vomited carnage is oozing in clumps 
Bones are smashed with mallets 
Marrow drooling from their maws 
Autophagous bacchanal of mutilated flesh 
Red in tooth and claw 

Tooth and claw! 

Slithering torsos congregrate 
As they're drawn to the transmission source 
Panic in the lair of the Basilisk 
Entrances are reinforced 
Shattering glass in the throne room 
As the multitudes seek to be fed 
The Basilisk flees into the swamp 
His acolytes are ripped to shreds 

The compound slaked in gore 
When Dissector passed the gate 
He smashed the dungeon door 
And Ghoul made our escape 

[Solo Digestor] 
[Solo Dissector] 

Tooth and claw!
