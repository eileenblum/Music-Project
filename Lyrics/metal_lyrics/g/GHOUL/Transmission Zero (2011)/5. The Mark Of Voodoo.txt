Seeking to possess the one thing that may be able to end his cursed existence, Baron Samedi is permitted an audience with the Basilisk. As the Baron's pitiful story unfolds, the Basilisk sees an opportunity... 

The Mark of Voodoo 

Born on a slaver in sixteen sixty six 
I was cut from the womb 
Of a screaming West African witch 
In Haiti they laid me upon the auction block 
And I sold for a song on a Port-au-Prince dock 

Raised by the Houngan, he taught me the rites 
I saw him murdered one terrible night 
Found at his side, covered in gore 
Beaten and kicked, thrown to the floor 

Dragged to the slave house 
Tied down in a circle of chalk 
Ritual candles anointed 
With the blood of a sacrificed cock 
The frenzy was building 
I pleaded with them for my life 
They cut out my heart with a sugar cane knife 

I opened my eyes to the dark of a grave 
My body was rotten, my thoughts were depraved 
Walking the Earth for eternity 
Cursed with the duties of Samedi 

I spoke to the dead as their flesh decayed 
They spoke of a skull in a land far away 
To Creepsylvania via Bombay! 
End this curse! 

[Solo Digestor]

Make these gruesome torments cease 
Give me the glory of deathly peace 
Put to rest these cursed bones 
"You'll find what you seek in the catacombs"
