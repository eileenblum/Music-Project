With three of the four fiends in chains, the Basilisk prepares the monstrous mezmetronic mind-control machine for its inaugural transmission to the unwitting dupes of Creepsylvania. As the final test before a worldwide broadcast nears, he reflects on small achievements through history... 

Morning of the Mezmetron 

We were there in the palace square 
When the Pharoahs took their thrones 
We whispered lies into Caesar's ear 
And our knives cut to the bone 
We raised a temple for Solomon 
And we made damn sure it fell 
And when that charlatan was crucified 
We wrote his story well 

Gaze at the unblinking eye 
Watch as your consciousness dies 
And welcome the new order's dawn 
Tremble in awe of the Mezmetron 

Emperors and Presidents 
Have fallen to our blades 
Weaving spiders are ensnared 
In the webs that they have made 
Guiding hands, overlords 
Call us what you will 
We are the authors of the prophecy 
And we shall see that it's fulfilled 

[Chorus]

[Solo Digestor]

Sleep, Sleep 

Now the final act begins 
It's the end of all mankind 
No more hatred, no more fear 
No reason for a mind 
Sit and watch the Mezmetron 
And you'll feel yourself go numb 
You begged for this, you prayed for it 
And now your day has come
