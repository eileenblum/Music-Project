As Killbot bears down on the fearsome foursome, the snarl of an ancient terror is heard from the darkness of the fungoid tunnels... 

Destructor

From a race and place unknown 
One ton of hair, teeth, muscle, and bone 
The savage lord of a bygone age 
A broken hulk on a carnival stage 
The people screamed, the whip cracked 
Bloody lashes on his quivering back 
A broken chain; pantaloons pissed 
The sickening crunch of his pitiless fists 

Through the murk of the stygian swamp 
Came the sound of a thundering stomp 
The wretched beast collapsed to the ground 
As the Swamp Hag came to check on the sound 
She gave him succor, she tended his wounds 
He made a nest in a crumbling tomb 
Every night he would come out to feast 
Clawing at the graves of the newly deceased 

[Solo Digestor]

The scent of blood perfumed the air 
Into the catacombs 
The monster lumbered, unaware 
Spiked fist, iron claw 
A sucker-punch to his powerful jaw 
Clashing giants, thundering blows 
Fermentor pitched in with a drum solo 

Core breach; coolant aboil 
Belching black smoke; vomiting oil 
A mighty club to a cast iron hull 
Transplanted brain liquified in its skull 
System failure, tubes were blown 
Two tons of steel dropped like a stone 
Massive damage, Killbot was fucked 
=Initiate sequence: Self Destruct=
