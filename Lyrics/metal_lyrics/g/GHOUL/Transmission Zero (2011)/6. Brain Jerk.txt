Armed with a bag of tsombi powder and a hastily drawn map, Samedi gains entrance to the catacombs only to find four hooded imbeciles trying to huff sewage fumes from a mummified skull. He offers his wares and three of the mutants greedily accept, with predictable results... 

Brain Jerk 

Friday night and I needed a thrill 
I'd swilled all the rot gut that I want to swill 
And numbskull wasn't fitting the bill 
Dug up a junkie, I shot up his brains 
Inhaled some jenkem through a jugular vein 
But nothing worked and I'm starting to twitch 
"I've got a concoction that will scratch at that itch" 

Brain Jerk! 

He had a skull full of voodoo blow 
An avalanche of Caribbean snow 
"What's in this shit?" "You don't wanna know..." 
We blew some rails, we got loose 
Settling in for a night of abuse 
Dissector left with a flimsy excuse 

The walls began to bleed 
The catacombs to heave 
Glowing serpents burrowed through 
The melting cosmic void 
Screaming through the nothingness 
Our addled minds destroyed 
Destroyed! 

Madness! Piercing the veil 
Perceptions were warped, senses assailed 
Crystalline thought-waves,luminous gloom 
Organic magma, edible doom 
Dilated pulsating orbs 
One with the aether, egos absorbed 
Phantasms shrieking, babies aflame 
"I think this is bunk..." 
"Man, that's totally lame" 

It started kicking in 
Fermentor cracked a toothless grin 
A feeling so bizarre 
"Tear this fucking place apart!"
