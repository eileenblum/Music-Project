On other side of town the cultists make a final push into the catacombs beneath Monture Noire cemetery, with predictable results... 

Off With Their Heads 

Cremator was burning, Fermentor was losing his shit 
My body was ravaged by shrapnel, Dissector was popping a zit 
Our only escape to retreat underground 
Coughing up blood as we fled 
The cultists were gathered like rats at the entrance 
Goose-stepping full-steam ahead 
(as they said) 

"Off with their heads!" 
"Brothers of Ghoul: steel yourselves for the fight! 
If it's Heavenly entrance they're after 
We will make damn sure that they get there tonight." 
Viciously hacking with jagged-edged blades 
Dissector laughed as they bled 
Cremator burnt off their lips and their ears 
Fermentor was heard to have said, 
"Off with their heads, hahahah!!!" 

[Solo Digestor]

Writhing and moaning, puddles of red 
Slitting their throats to ensure they were dead 
Into the torchlight, a vision of dread 
Cold iron lungs bellowed "Off with their heads!" 

Off with their heads!
