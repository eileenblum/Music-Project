As the last of the cultists writhe in their own half-devoured entrails and Baron Samedi sifts through the shattered remnants of the crystal skull, Ghoul fiddles with the smoking hulk of the Mezmetron. A button is pushed and the machine roars to life. In Portland, Oregon a young nerd turns his television to a UHF channel and is surprised by what he sees... 

Metallicus Ex Mortis 

So you're an anti-social geek 
With body odor, funny hair, and your breath reeks 
You have no friends of which to speak 
Now your mind has come unglued 
And your trust fund balance is down the tubes 
There's only one thing you can do 

Commit yourself, submit yourself 
Give us your body and your soul 
Enslave yourself and save yourself 
And sign in blood upon the scroll 
On your straightjacket stitched, the hermetic seal 
The pin is thrust as the blood congeals 
Your card is dealt and your fate is sealed 
Raise the chalice and take the cure 
Numbskull from the freshly interred 
Your servitude is now all but ensured 

Commit yourself, submit yourself 
Give us your body and your soul 
Enslave yourself and save yourself 
And spill your blood for rock n roll 
Now your guts are a foetid yellow slush 
Twitching pupils dilate 
As your brain is turned to mush 

[Solo Dissector] 

Metallicus Ex Mortis! 
Reborn in decay 
Metallicus Ex Mortis! 
As your life rots away
