I'm on the dark side sinnin' and grinnin' then you let me in
Fill you up with passion and rage
I stroke you slow, deep and under
Try to make you wonder just why you feel so violently strange?
Now don't you feel like a god when you come and savior my skin?
And don't you feel like a whore to let the pussy worship begin?

'cause they say I'm in the wrong but I'm feeling so right
Awaken for your saviour she's coming tonight
To change your sex slowly, shape your member right
Join the pussy worship tonight
Damned and rising, flesh is the law!
I'll be your goddess and you'll sing my praises
Yeah, yeah, yeah, flesh is the law!
I sleep with the god damned and you get the graces

Come on and stick your finger into me
Just as far as you can see
Blind you when you look in my eyes
Now every woman that you see is hidden deep inside of me
Makes you feel so violently strange
Now don't you feel like a god when you come and savior my skin?
And don't you feel like a whore? Let the pussy worship begin

'cause they say I'm in the wrong but I'm feeling so right
Awaken for your saviour she's coming tonight
I change my sex slowly, shape my member right
Join the pussy worship tonight
Call you on your broken souls
Bring me all your broken dreams
You always stop and right
Join the pussy worship tonight
Damned and rising, flesh is the law!
I'll be your goddess and you'll sing my praises
Yeah, yeah, yeah, flesh is the law!
I sleep with the god damned and you get the graces
Rise! Rise! Flesh is the law!
