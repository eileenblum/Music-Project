White! Then you look away.
You reach for assistance when you start to sway.
Knees feel weak, as your vision fades away.
When you're faced with death, that's when you start to pray.
Blind! Now you can see the myths you create about reality.
Darkness on the streets, you let the world deceive you.
In my company, reality will greet you.
Psyche... Check... Check
Cry to me, as your vision fades away.
Gonna rate your sickness by your will to stay.
Blind. Now you don't see. No why. No where. No way.
You're better off to pray.
Darkness on the streets, you let the world deceive you.
In my company, reality will greet you.
Psyche... Check... Check... Check
Someday, gonna have to say, someday gonna have a real dark day?
Someday, someday, gonna pay for play someday I'm gonna show a real quick
way... to see your life flash before your eyes.
White, then you look away.
I sense your resistance as you start to sway.
Knees feel weak, as your vision fades away.
Cause now you're faced with death and there's no use to pray.
Blind... Now you don't see.
I know why, know where; no way, better fuckin' pray.
Darkness on the streets, you don't let your world deceive you.
In my company, reality will greet you.
Darkness on the streets, don't let the world deceive you.
In my company, reality will greet you.
Darkness on the streets, you let the world deceive you.
In my company, reality will greet you.
Psyche... Check... Check... Check
