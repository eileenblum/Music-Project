Watch the ones who will not let you see.
What falls beyond their conformity.

Of one God.
Of one Mind.
Of one Soul.
You take control.

You're set apart without a cross to wear.
Left alone with out their guilt to bear.

Transcend, transcend all of the worlds that trap you in.
Transcend, transcend another farce you'll have to end.
Watch the ones that who will not let you see,
what falls beyond their conformity.
