Writhe among the flesh.
{We} stroke your fearful eyes.
Penetrations will collide, as I crawl inside.
As your eyes begin to slip, you come alive in my caress.
As our greedy fingers dig deep on the edge of a dreamless sleep.

Live steel drives deep.
Senses surging in you when you sleep.
Come to me... Taste the need.
Painfully urging me to watch you bleed.

I put the needle in you... I want you on your back.
Velvet dreams... A quick solution to set you free.
As your sex begins to drip, the scent reminds you of my grip.
Your ruptured senses will divide as I slip inside.

I put the needle in you... I like you on your back.
Velvet dreams... A quick solution to set you free.
Watch you quiver... Watch you shake.
Writhe... As I crawl inside.
When you're here all alone...
When you're dreaming... Watch you scream...
Deeper... Drive it deeper... Drive it deep inside of me.
Pain in places you never knew, as my world slips into you.
Take... Taste...

I put the needle in you... I want you on your back.
Velvet dreams... Dig your fingers in me, I like you on your back.
Watch you quiver... Watch you shake.
Watch you bend the rules we make.
Inside (sic)
As I crawl inside.
When you're here all alone.
When you're in line.
