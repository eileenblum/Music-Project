Unfathomable depths of fanaticism and depravity

Do our choosing without hesitation... Give yourself over to sin.
Your one chance for redemption shall come when the spark is ignited within.
Forced to sever the ties to this world which is bound by lies.
Your free from original sin, forced to find what was hidden within.

Breathe you in; lead you out.
Inflame your passions within our depravity, give yourself over to sin.

You won't emerge without transformation... Flesh our soul will win.
Forced to sever the ties to this world which is bound by lies.
You're free from original sin, forced to find what is hidden within.

I am in command

Forced to lay, locked away, made to serve... another 120 days.

This will even prevent masturbation

You rise in the presence of our libertinage, taste all the pleasures of sin.
Your one desire controlled by perversion, compelled by lust within.
Forced to sever the ties, to this world which is bound by lies.
You're free from original sin... Release what was hidden within.
Forced to lay, locked away, made to serve... Another 120 days.
I slide a glance in your direction
Just what you need and then you'll want to say
"fill my hole with your affection"
Conditioned to begin
10 more hours to save your flowers, or watch them wilt away
We'll hunt you, we want you
Where forever is one day
