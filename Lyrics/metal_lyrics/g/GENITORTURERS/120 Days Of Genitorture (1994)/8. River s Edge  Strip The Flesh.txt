Rip it. Tearing me. Need it bad. Need that pain inside of me.
There's no pain without my name.
There is no pain without...
Said rip you baby yeah.
So tight.

Say you wanna make it in the nightime's deadly stare.
Never ever dreamed I'd deliver such a deep forbidden lair.
Tempt you to make it, I'll take you for a ride.
Forever down by the river where I'll breathe you deep inside.
Say push... Say push it in... Say push... Say push it... in.
There is no pain without my name.
There is no pain in here.

Said rip you baby yeah.
So tight.

Rip it.
Gonna take you inside of me.
Gonna break you.
See what you can say.
Pain
Strip... In a fever lick my carcass.
I need to rape your shattered bones.
In a fever you were taken from my bed.
I need to suck you in.
My severed sore... you were a victim baby of my pain within.
Tormented twin, my pain within.
To live without your presence is but a sin.
Because I need your pain;
I need your pumping brain.
I need to break you.
In a fever I let my pain die.
I need to rape your shattered bones.
In a fever you were taken from my bed.
I need to suck... This.
My severed sore... you were a victim baby of my pain within.
Tormented twin, my pain within.
To live without your presence is but a sin.
Because I need your pain;
I need your pumping brain.
I need to break you.
Rip it ripping... Tearing... Need it yeah
I need to strip the flesh.
For pain.
Pain
Strip flesh
