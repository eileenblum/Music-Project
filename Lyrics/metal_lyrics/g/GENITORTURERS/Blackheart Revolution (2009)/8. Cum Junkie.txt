Let's go!
Oh, yeah!

I want your body, yeah! I want you mine.
You know you like the way it feels, you cannot hide.
So keep on thrillin' me, drillin' me hard.
Keep me cummin', keep me up all night.
This conversation get me high.
Clever touch will say to you

Let's go! Cum junkie! Turn me on!
Let's go! Cum junkie! Can't stop feelin' me up all night, baby.

Are you feelin' me, feelin' me now?
I'll keep you cummin', keep you up and how.
I'm on a mission, wanna keep you high.
Too many kisses for you I live by.

Want it, I want it all you see.
Cummin' on's not a game to me.
I want it, I want it, oh, you know!
A clever touch will say to you;

Let's go! Cum junkie! Turn me on!
Let's go! Cum junkie! Can't stop feelin' me up all night!
Let's go! Cum junkie! You know you want it from me!
Let's go! Cum junkie! I see it in your eyes, come in here.

Yeah,
You wanna cum, like a ride.
You wanna fuck me deep inside.
You wanna go all the ways down.

You never, feel it all the way.
Never had to question if you'd wanna stay.
Say you love, say you love, say you love me now.
Say you love it, say you love, say you love me now!

Let's go! Cum junkie! Turn me on!
Let's go! Cum junkie! Can't stop feelin' me up all night!

Let's go! Cum junkie! You know you want it! You say you do!
Let's go! Cum junkie! I see it in your eyes, come in here!

Let's go!
It's pumpin' over, heavy in the night.
Hold me in the dark, when we're up all night.
It's pumpin' over, heavy in the night.
Hold me in the dark when we're up all night.

Say you love, say you love, say you love it now.
Say you love it, say you love, say you love me now!
