Tell me, tell me, tell me, it's not over
Tell me, tell me, tell me, I'm not afraid
Tell me, cause your skin is turning inside out
Tell me, tell me, tell me, it's not the same

Tell me!

Tell me, tell me, tell me, your condition
Tell me were you losin' from the start?
And did I allude you, did I use you?
Been kicked until your heart beats black and blue, blue, blue!

Well, I tried, to wait
You suffer, while I hesitate
Yes I, you know, before you leave me
Tell me!

Tell me!
Now, you still love me
Love me, yeah, tell me!

Tell me!
Now!

You still love me!
Want me, gotta know right now!

Yeah!
Gotta know right now!

Tell me, cause I know you've all been waiting
Tell me that your sacrifice is true
Your livin' hard, you're feelin' scarred
You're suffocating
But deep inside, your heart beats black and blue, blue, blue!

Well I tried, to wait
You suffer while I hesitate
Yes, I, ?you may?
Before you leave me

Because, I wait all day
Save your sacrificial games for later
Before you leave me, tell me!

Tell me!
Now!

Do you still love me?
Love me? Yeah!
Tell me! Tell me now!
You still love me? Want me? Yeah, tell me!
Tell me right now!
You still love me? Love me? Yeah, tell me!
Tell me right now! You still love me?
You want me, gotta know right now!

Because I'm waiting, got you waitin'!
Got you waitin'!
For you to see
Right now!
