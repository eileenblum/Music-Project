Do it to me! C'mon!

Oh, yeah!

Well, I said I was a sinner, baby
Said I was alone
Saw the walls come-a crashing down
While the demons moan

Hell is gonna take me
Hell is gonna take me, make me strong
Hell is gonna do me
I'm goin' to Hell, I can't see nothin' wrong!

I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil in a bottle, yeah
I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil gets the best of me

Well, suckin' in the juice will make you feel better
Wanna walk in the gutter tonight
Skin on skin, my mind is gettin' crazy
Wanna leave this world behind!

Hell is gonna take me
Hell is gonna take me, make me strong
Hell is gonna do me fuckin' right!
Yeah, we'll do you fuckin' wrong!

I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil in a bottle, yeah
I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil gets the best of me

I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil in a bottle, yeah
I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil gets the best of me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Ow
Do it to me

Here comes sanctuary, yeah
Put it in you, till you can't see straight
And now you're suckin' it down
And now you're wonderin' why you feel no pain

You're goin' out
You're goin' out
You're goin' out
You're goin' out

Yeah!

I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil in a bottle, yeah (ooh yeah!)
I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil gets the best of me (yeah, yeah!)

I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle,
Devil in a bottle, yeah!
I'm goin' out with a devil in a bottle
Devil gets the best of me

Yeah, yeah!
He gets the best of me
Ah

Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, to me!
