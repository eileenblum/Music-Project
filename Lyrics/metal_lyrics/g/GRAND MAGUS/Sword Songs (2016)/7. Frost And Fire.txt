Burning hair
Bringer of despair
Mother of the one who takes the moon
Fierce and tall she will devour all
And her spawn will break the seal of runes

Winds that rage across the fields and lakes
She will ride out from the frozen realm
Screaming through the sky
Wreathed in fury

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

Shadow steed will bring her fatal deeds
And a power never seen before
Serpent reins on a wolf from Hel
She descended on the funeral shore
The gathering didn't have her strength
And she proved that she could best them all
Daughter of the ironwood has come

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

As the ring horn sails
She has won
And her sons will rise

Frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
