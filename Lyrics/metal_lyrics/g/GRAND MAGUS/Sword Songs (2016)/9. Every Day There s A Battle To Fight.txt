All the walls around you
No one really knows how they were made
Who chose that way?
Conformity or safety
Questioning your sanity is brave
You're not a slave, no
Too many hearts grow stale and cold
Too many die inside and fold

Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way

Find the key inside you
Shining through the madness and the hate

It's not too late
A path is always open
Reborn into the thunder and the rain
Free from all shame, yeah
The smallest creatures have it right
The truth is grey not black and white

Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way

Stand in your way
