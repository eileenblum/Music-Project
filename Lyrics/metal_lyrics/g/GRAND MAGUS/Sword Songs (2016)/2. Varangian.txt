Fire will guide us on perilous seas
Light in the black the sign that we need
Charge through the storm
Swords in our hands
Leave it to fate or fear takes command

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors â defenders of steel
Fight through the wars, hunger and need
Warriors â defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Bravery, loyalty bound by the oath
Sworn to protect so far from our home
Guarding a throne, an emperor's reign
Honour is all to the god of the slain

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors â defenders of steel
Fight through the wars, hunger we feed
Warriors â defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors â defenders of steel
Fight through all wars, hunger we feed
Warriors â defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Burn our way to Odin's hall
