All the prophets and deceivers
Try to lead us all astray
We're trusting only in the blade
And the path of destiny
Too proud to kneel
But not to bend
This sword will bring your end
The key to victory is ours
Wielding power in our hand

Bringing
Viking metal â bring you to your knees
Viking metal â a warrior's decree
Viking metal â death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel â Viking metal

We will feed the eagle
We have the means we have the will
Break through your fortress
And your armour
Our edge is primed to kill
We live and die
Our fate is planned
No one fears his end
The key to victory is ours
Wielding power in our hand

Bringing
Viking metal â bring you to your knees
Viking metal â a warrior's decree
Viking metal â death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel â Viking metal

My enemies they must fall down
Mud in the blood-stained ground

Odin grant me gold and glory
Key to victory
Sword of power

Viking metal â bring you to your knees
Viking metal â a warrior's decree
Viking metal â death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel â Viking metal

Odin grant me gold and glory
Key to victory
Sword of power
