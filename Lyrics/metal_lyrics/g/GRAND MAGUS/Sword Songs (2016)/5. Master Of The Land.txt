Light, the search goes on inside
Deep within my mind
A key that seems to hide
Torn, chained and bound with scorn
Let me be reborn
Into glory ride

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn

Free, longing to reveal
A dream so long concealed
Destiny achieved
Burn, wisdom will be mine
Secrets I will learn
Into glory ride

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call 

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn
