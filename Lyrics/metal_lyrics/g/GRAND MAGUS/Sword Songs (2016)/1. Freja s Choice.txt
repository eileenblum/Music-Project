Truth in lying
Never can tell
Words that twist and betray
Lore of secrets
Casting her spell
Charms to lure you away

Sorceress
Master of the Sejd
She'll light the way

Her eyes will leave a mark
Her dreams will fill the heart
Her name brings out desire
Riddles in the dark

She'll light the spark

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Fateful Beauty
Glowing and pure
Turn your gaze down in awe
Golden Mistress
Sowing the need
Sacrifice to receive

Maiden of the shield guides you ashore
The prize of war
Ride on silver wing
Let Valkyries take you home
Her gift is of love
A chance to be reborn

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Freja's choice is always glory
Borne upon the blood-stained wings of war

Blood-stained wings of war
