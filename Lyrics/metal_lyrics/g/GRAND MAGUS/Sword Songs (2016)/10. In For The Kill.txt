Born again as dusk approaches
I've been living far too long as a slave
To the laws of your world
Sound the howl of total freedom
Make the sky and earth my kingdom
There's a gleam and a flash in my eyes
By tomorrow all the sorrow will be gone

I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind

Now their walls give no protection
The grip of fear means no detection
Of the force set upon men and gods
No belief and no religion
Will protect your life from leaving
As the fear reaches out to your soul
It's a grasp that will never let its hold

I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind

You will die
