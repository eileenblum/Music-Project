Facing the enemy fear and insanity
Fight with your back to the wall
Horses are falling no quarter is given
Ravens will feast on them all
Gather your strength and ride through the storm
No one will catch you alive
It weather of blades and as twilight sets in
This is the final goodbye

Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

Bereft of all dignity, pain and depravity
No one will live through this day
The sound of the suffering left as an offering
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
You stand in the rain as you fought through it all
Tomorrow will never appear
Embracing your fate as the dusk closes in
Blood is the prize of the brave

Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

Bereft of all dignity
Blood is the prize of the brave
No one will live through this day
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates

Ride through the storm
Song of the sword

You'll be marching on
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
