You were just a child when the flame began to burn
You could not run you could not hide
No one told you there was so much more to learn
Just would not stop before you tried

You hear the calling
Inside you knew

Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend when you call for

The king has justified the cruelty and pain
A crown and glory
To revel in
Short in stature but a savior to the land
Just let them burn and let me win

I heard the calling
Inside I knew

Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend to the end

I'm the underdog
Never bark before I bite
Peace a word I never learned
In war my victories mean strife and loss of lives
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle

My need was created at birth
For glory and blood I was born â burn

Never cared if I'd return

Born for battle
I heard the calling
I'll defend when you call for battle
My sword was the warning
I was born for battle
