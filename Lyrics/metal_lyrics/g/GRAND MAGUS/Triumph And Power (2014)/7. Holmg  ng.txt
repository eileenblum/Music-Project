You're awaiting your turn, jealousy burns - you know you had your chance
Wanting to lead, filling your greed - envy drives your plans
Stole what I made, all that I saved - never letting up
But in the end there can be only one - and justice will be done

Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light

Sun in the back when I attack - there is no return
Beckoning time, I know what is mine - only you will burn
In the light of the day you'll finally pay - this is what you learn
In the end there can be only one - and justice will be done

Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
Justice will be done
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
There can be only one
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
