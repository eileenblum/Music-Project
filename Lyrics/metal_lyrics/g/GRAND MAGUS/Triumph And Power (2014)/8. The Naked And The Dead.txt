In a flash he turned to stone
Hesitated, lost control
Just a man a dying warrior
Battleground drenched in blood
Bodies flayed down in the mud
Mercy never came on this day

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood

While the blood seeps to the ground
There are times you realise
How the pain can change your life
Bragging fools will surely pay the price
No set of rules will end the strife
You have to twist and bend in life
The mind is what defines a warrior

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
And if the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
Only the chosen one will rise
