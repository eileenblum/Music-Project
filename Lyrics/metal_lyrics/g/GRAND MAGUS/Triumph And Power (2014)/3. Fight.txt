They forged an alliance - and legions attend
They steal and conspire - all means to an end
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within

'Cause we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right till the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

Through ages of darkness, slavery and pain
The lie they call "progress" - an expanding domain
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within

And we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive

For too long did we relent
While they stole at our expense
Now the tide has turned
They must fall
and we will rise standing tall

[Solo]

Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive

Fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
