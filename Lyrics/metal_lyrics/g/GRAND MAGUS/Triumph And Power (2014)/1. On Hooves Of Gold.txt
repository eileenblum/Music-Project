They are masters of defiance - masters of the wind
Let us fly together - let the change begin
Mountains lie below us - the stars are getting near
All doubt has left my being - strength replacing fear
And they said it's too late - but the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

Consuming without feeling - a hollow life of shame
The elders, well of knowledge - discarded, thrown away
New gods taking over - thievery and false pride
Burn the gifts of nature, laugh at the giver of life
With greed raping the land
They don't even know what they demand, no
And they say it's too late - but the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

Ride the wind - change begin
And they say it's too late
But the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
