He made a promise many years ago to break and scorch the land
He had a need for destruction and to bend us to the ground
He swore an oath: To bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become

The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate

Bringing everlasting pain
So many tragedies and years ago for you to understand
The devastation that he brought will leave a mark until the end
He swore an oath - to bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become

The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate

He walks alone
He'll put out our fire with scorn
He'll never rest - just enslave us
Destroyer of beasts and of man
Enforcer of madness and pain
He's sworn to break us - the dominator
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate - Dominate
I swore an oath - I will reverse his plan
I will restore - bringing power to the land, but the price is that I am

The dominator - freedom hater - I will bleed you, crush your dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - breathing pain

Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate â Dominate
