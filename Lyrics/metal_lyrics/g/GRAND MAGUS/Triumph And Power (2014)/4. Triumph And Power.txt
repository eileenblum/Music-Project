Room to breathe
Fill my need
Give me space
Plant the seed

Born alone
Slowly grown
There's a strength
In my breed

Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

Will of iron
Quiet soul
Empty words
Empty roles

Break their walls
Break their rules
Fiercely defiant
Damn the fools

Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

At last there's a reason to believe
To rise from the depths of misery
My heart clad in iron
My soul clad in steel
The triumph and power achieved

As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
