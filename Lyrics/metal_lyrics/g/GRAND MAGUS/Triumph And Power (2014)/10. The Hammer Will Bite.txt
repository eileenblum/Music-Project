The giant arrived, scheming to end Asa rule
Mean as a whip, hard as a rock but a fool
The battle will start at the first light of tomorrow
Jorunheim knew what the thunder would bring

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die

Colossal in size, they built him with magic and clay
Heart from a horse, a fatal mistake for this day
Protector of Asgard never lacked courage
The towering help to the giants will fail

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die

By morning light - the giants die
My death is guaranteed - unless I make him bleed
I can't face him on my own - it's sorcery I need
My help is gone - I'm on my own
My stone is thrown - all is lost

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die
