Sacrifice
The only way to be sure
To rid the land
Of the plague that's been haunting us all
Restoring our faith
In the axe and the sword

Slaves for so long
Our minds filled up with their lies
Now the Christian cross
Forever erased from our eyes

Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can

Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can

Run if you can
Run if you can
Run if you can
RUN IF YOU CAN
