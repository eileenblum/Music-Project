Wheel of time rotating ever onward
Nothing new and nothing has been learned
The same mistakes still repeated every time
A pleasant ignorance rules the crooked line

Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will just wither away

Time to wake from your non-creative slumber
Seasons change but still you stay the same
A crushing blow's going to force your decision
You realize that there is no prize for you

Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will wither away

Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!
Yeah

Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!
