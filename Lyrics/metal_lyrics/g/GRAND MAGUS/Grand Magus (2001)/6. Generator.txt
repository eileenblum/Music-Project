Like a lead-heavy generator
Just pushing everything aside
I took my pill and now I feel alright

Like a wheel dead-set on moving
Perpetual bliss in sight
I took my fill and now I feel alright

Oh yeah, I feel alright
Believe me I feel just fine
Oh yeah, I feel alright

Got no restraining shackles
Just a highway stretching far and wide
The sun shines down and feeds me with what I need

There ain't nobody waiting
I'm free to do whatever I please
I've flipped the coin and now I will be seen

Yeah, I will be seen
I'm coming out, I'm coming clean
Oh yeah I will be seen
I will be mean
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light

Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, now you meet your doom
Emerald, emerald eyes prepare for your undoing
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light

Oh come on
Yeah
