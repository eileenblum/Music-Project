Got firm belief in what's to come
Your treacherous ways leave me cold and numb
No magic circle will save you now
Your scent's been picked up by my wish to strike

You try to hide behind a veil of smoke
To summon petty demons, will not work
Cause my familiar has searched you out
To make you pay for all the pain I took
