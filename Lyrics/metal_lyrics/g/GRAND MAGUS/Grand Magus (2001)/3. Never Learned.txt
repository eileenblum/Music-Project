I have been told
Why I can't grow old
I never learned
To stay away
When the water churns

Alright

I can't be sold
No matter what your gold
I, oh I
I've never learned
I never learned
I've never learned
Never learned
I never learned

Cause I never learned
I never learned
Never learned
I never learned
Cause I never learned
