A mighty blast of fire burned across the sky
It is no unknown power causing this tonight
They didn't know I had it in me but I have returned
Transformed, no longer human, watch the heavens burn

You'll pay

They hear the hooves thundering, raising up a storm
He comes with vengeance seething, breaking up the calm
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign

Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell

Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign

Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell
