All that I want, give me just what I need
What I've been told ain't exactly what I've seen
I'll just lay low here for the time being
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole

Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, is the wind of my soul
In that Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in... alright!

Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, the wind of my soul, yeah
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole
