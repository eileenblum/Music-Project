A glade became the setting
Must have been about noon
Grass so green and tender
Ripped apart by steel clad boots

Mid-day's sun reflected
In weapons sharp as steel
Grim determination
One shall die and one shall live

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

Now the wounds are open
Blood engulfing all
Ready for the gauntlet
One will stand and one will fall

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

Alright
