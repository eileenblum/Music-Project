Time to reap all the violence they have sewn
Kept you down with their torture
Crushed your bones
From slavery your rebellion screams of fire
Too late 'cause you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Two thousand years spent imprisoned
You were chained
Born a stallion but broken down - hurt and malmed
A fury and rage ignited in the tears
they'll pay and you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder, shake the ground
