Go on tell me 'bout the reason always turning wrong from right just try, explain your sad existence, why you seem to fear the night
Your answer will show - that dead is your king
I look in your eyes - confusion within
You lose all your pride, and scream as i bite
In a starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Too late, I asked you and i listened and groveling won't save you now
Your tales betray your lack of freedom, struggling to face the light
My Hymn to the moon piercing your mind
Your science will fail
Your eyes turn blind
When red turns to black and the silver moon is full
They will drown in lakes of blood, and regret what they tried to pull
Starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
