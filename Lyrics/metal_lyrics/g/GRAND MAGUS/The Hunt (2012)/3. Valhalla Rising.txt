Feel â take my hand
See â wasted lands

âCause I lost my fire, and itâs tearing up my soul
Got to fight if I want it
So tired of liars, theyâre filling me with shame
Got to fight and get stronger

But the road is long and treachery awaits
To find whatâs wrong I have to reach and reveal to see

Valhalla rising â Iâm taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising â I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire is the seed

Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...

I restored my fire now itâs filling up my soul
Even though I was broken
And I fought the liars â the worst of all was me
All the false words Iâd spoken

As I travelled on I realised my fate
It made me strong and now I finally see what's been revealed

Valhalla rising â Iâm taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising â I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed

Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...

And now I finally see what's been revealed

Valhalla rising â Iâm taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising â I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed

Take my hand!
