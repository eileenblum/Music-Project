The first was the last one
The last one to fall
He sounded the warning
And put out the call
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
The men on the shoreline
Guardians of old
They prayed for a warning
They ran from the wall
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
