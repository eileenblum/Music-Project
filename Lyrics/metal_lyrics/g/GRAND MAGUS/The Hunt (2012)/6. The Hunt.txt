He's alive -- the stories were right
And now there's a lesson to learn

Took his land and curse him as damned
But now he will make them all burn

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Running free, the beast inside of me
Will join in his howl to the moon

Every sense come alive
And the passion ignites

'cause his beckoning call brings us doom

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Blood will stain the land
As the hunt will take command

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies,

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Blood will spill
We follow the hunt
Chase and kill
We follow the hunt
