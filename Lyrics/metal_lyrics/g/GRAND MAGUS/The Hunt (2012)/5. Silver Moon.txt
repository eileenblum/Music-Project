Unleashed by my hate -
Flesh torn away from the bone
A fire that burns - a fever that never subsides
Surrender to fate - free from the shackles that bind
By the silvery sheen -
The moon will decide who will die
I've found the strength to live alone
I've left my kin I've left my home
By silver light I'll carve my own
To last and live my power's grown

Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall

Summoning fire - men of the cross stand aside
A heathen belief - northern revenge is at hand
No masters or kings -
The cry for my freedom resounds
The passion is free -
The blood-covered snow is the sign

Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall
