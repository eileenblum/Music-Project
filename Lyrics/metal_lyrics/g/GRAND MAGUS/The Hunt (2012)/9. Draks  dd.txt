There's a lock inside the lonely cell, but we fail to find the key
There's a way to solve the riddles quick, but we always choose to leace
If the urge to hurt the weaker one gets stronger than before
Maybe wisdom leaves us all alone and we'll never break the door
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness will spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid web of lies, web of lies
So we're pushing on for selfishness, while me march on forever blind
We develop as we sell our souls, and the connection is lost in time
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness would spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleassant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid we b of lies, web of lies
No use in waiting for it - your kind will never understand
What separates us is a plan
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Spin a solid web of lies, web of lies
