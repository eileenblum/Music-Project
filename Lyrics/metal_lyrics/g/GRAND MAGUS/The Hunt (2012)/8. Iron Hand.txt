You speak of hell and how you fell
Looking out for something new
You broke the law, you've seen it all
Really nothing more to tell
But you miss a vital piece - the key to everlasting power
Yes you lack the inner strength - a way to push them all aside
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times - never let them see the way to climb
Rulel them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
You speak of pain and always claim
You never really had a chance
But there's a call to break them all
Listen now or try in vain
There's a way to build the strength - a path to everlasting power
Summon up the right defense - and you'll break their will to fight
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times, never let them see the way to climb
Rule them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
Rule them all
Rule with an iron hand or you will fall
