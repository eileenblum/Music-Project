[Part I: NattfÃ¶dd]

One night in November my soul found a heart
In glistening frost by the light of the stars
One night in November my soul found its home
In the glow of the moon I was born
All my grief washed away
It's the end of my plight
No mourning was left
Only feral delight
All my grief washed away
By the blood that was shed
In the glow of the moon I was born

[Part II: VedergÃ¤llning]

Hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Nine days t obring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Eight brings me sight
Seven gives me light
Six days and wounds are healed
Strength has returned
Bless the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
Praise the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
I will hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Swear to return
Nine days to bring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Five proves me right
Four ends the fight
Three, two and one completes the change
Then I will rise
