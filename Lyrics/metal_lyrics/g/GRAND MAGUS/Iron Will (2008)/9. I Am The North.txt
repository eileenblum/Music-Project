Joined by the cry of ravens
A chase in the winter cold
First born son of storms
hated and scorned

Free from the cage of morals
Shadow of the ruling kind
The echoes of the savage call
Roll across the land

Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight

The Wolf will rise
The end of lies
Corruption dies
Free forever

Burn with the lord of sorrow
Claimed by the shit of nails
Life and death - final breath
Born into the grave

Storm of an ancient fury
Power beyond compare
Serpent's flood - brother's blood
End of times is here

Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight
