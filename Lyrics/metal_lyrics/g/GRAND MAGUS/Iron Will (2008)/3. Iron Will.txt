Failure - reaching out to greet me
But I will never fall
Aversion - has filled my inner being
But I will never crawl

Obsession - I never fell the pain
Redemption - I will rise again

Again and again

Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

Hatred - it used to feel so easy
Turn away when they call
Craving - driven by the strong need
Alone against them all

Aggression - fuelled by burning hate
Vengeance - I will rise again

Again and again

Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember
