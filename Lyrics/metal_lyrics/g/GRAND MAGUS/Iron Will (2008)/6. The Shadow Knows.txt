The laugh will be the warning
He will break your mental wall
Pulverize resistance
Then sacrifice you all

His solemn promise given
To never be a slave
To stand among the fallen
And fight beyond the grave

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Through Secrecy Mastery Alchemy
Perish in his fire

The wight of procreation
Will never bring him down
Survive humiliation
And laugh when time is gone

The powers of corruption
Will shiver at his gaze
The weed of crime may blossom
But will perish in his flame

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Through Secrecy Mastery Alchemy
Perish in his fire
