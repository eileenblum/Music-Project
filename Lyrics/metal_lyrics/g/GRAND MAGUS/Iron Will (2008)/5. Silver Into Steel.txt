Time is at hand

Gathering hunger in the night
To feast and to burn
better look for the right of his hands
Summon a feeling of might
Caressed by the dark
The glow of the moon in the eye

Kissing the sweet taste in the air
Embraced by the stars
A home has been found in the end
Time is at hand
Of triumph and sense
A revenge for the times of despair

Silver into Steel
