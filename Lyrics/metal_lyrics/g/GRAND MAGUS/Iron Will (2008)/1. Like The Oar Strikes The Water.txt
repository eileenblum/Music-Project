Defile your life with religion
And sell your soul
You put all trust in your holy man

You may deny it's illusion
Just worthless rules
You turn away when you thin you can

Corrupting life with suppression
The safest way
You wash your hands in your piety

The winds have turned in your favour
Your time is here
A congregation on a massive scale

But when the night finally falls
And when the truth finally dawns

Just like the oar strikes the water

But when the night finally falls
Yeah when the truth finally dawns

Just like the oar strikes the water
