You smile and claim purity of soul
I feel the need to rise above it all

A burning urge will guide me away
Your black and white will lose to the grey

As i walk - beyond good and evil

Your rules betray your need to make a stand
You fight the herd, still need security

There is no true or false in the world
You might be right but I'm not wrong

As i walk - beyond good and evil

beyond good and evil
good and evil
good and evil
beyond good and evil
