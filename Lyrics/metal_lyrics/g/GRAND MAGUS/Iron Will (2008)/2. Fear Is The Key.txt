Hear crushing thunder
Electrifying storm
Winter is calling
Time to hold one's own

Fear is the weapon
To break the cage of man
Control lies inside me
The terror reveals the plan

Unbeliever, unbeliever
The mind will tell me how
Fear is the key

Last of the shadows
Screaming out my name
Strong determination
A guide through searing flame

Blind Beliver
Choose the easy way
Pray for absolution
You know you've gone astray

When blackest depths will face me
Ask no one's help, to break my fall
Born, dead and free forever
I know that fear is the key
