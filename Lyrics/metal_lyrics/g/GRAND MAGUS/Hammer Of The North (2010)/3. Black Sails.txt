Whipping in the wind
Rule with fear and dreams that tear the light
Sleepless empty nights

A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end

Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

Simple life seems hard
Looming shadows
They stalk

A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end

Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

The sea turns red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
