Living in denial and never seeing straight or clear
Deep down in your senses you feel that fear
Fear of true alliance, nothing worth the fight
No use standing up when wrong rule what's right

When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer

Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star

Banish the false religions
Learn to stand alone
Nothing up above and no one below
Fear of new beginnings
Like a demon in your soul
You must turn your ear to the beckoning call

When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer

Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Weakness spreading like a plague
Will you make the change or stay the same and fail
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star
