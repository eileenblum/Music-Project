The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

Take a deep breath
Watch the forest pull him in
Preparations - Soon the trials will begin

A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again

The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize
He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

Son of giants
Lust and hate is his disguise
Purifier - Naked he'll escape the fires

A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again

The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
