See the savage son arrive
striking terror on all sides
He's been waiting all this time
for his reign to come alive

Bite
he will do or die
Fight to hold on, aim for the throne
Bite
he will burn their pride
Rise northern child you've grown

See the iron sky descend
on a world that just pretends
It's a lonely path to walk
but an honor to defend

Those who walk against the wind
will always walk alone
