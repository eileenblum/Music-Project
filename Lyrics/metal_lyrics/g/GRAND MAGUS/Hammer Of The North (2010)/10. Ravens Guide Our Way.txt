We ride endless blackened waves
To  the land of our kin
Snow lords, kings of northern seas
Brought us home again
True hearts gathering up our will
Conquered what we chose
Black wings lead us to the fray
Gave us victory

Legions stood against us
They tried to make us pay
But never faltered or failed
We are cunning - Ravens guide our way

Crossfire lit the northern shore
Never stopped our return
Not force, driven by our fate
Gave us victory

Legions stood against us
They tried to make us pay
But never faltered or failed
We are cunning - Ravens guide our way

Black birds fly
Guide us home
Leave your throne
