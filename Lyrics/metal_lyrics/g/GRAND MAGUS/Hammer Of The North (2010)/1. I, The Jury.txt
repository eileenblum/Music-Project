Damnation - their lies used to lead me away
Feeding my desperate heart - with merciless flames
I soon realized there's nothing to gain
And all the dreams that I had had got lost in my pain

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

Wisdom has sprung - and taken my heart
Nothing will stand in my way - I'll tear them apart
Revelation - no one can lead me astra
Follow my own burning path - away from all slaves

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

Riding the teeth of the wind - all barriers part

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law
