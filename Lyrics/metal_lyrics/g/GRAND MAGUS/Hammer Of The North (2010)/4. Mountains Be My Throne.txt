I'm coming don to the meeting
There's trouble all around
A final push for the silence
The symbol has been shown

Now if I can't wield the power
I'll find another way
Without your guide, will you make it?
Just sheep that go astray

Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

Rising
Watch me climbing
Soaring high, the sun won't bind me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
