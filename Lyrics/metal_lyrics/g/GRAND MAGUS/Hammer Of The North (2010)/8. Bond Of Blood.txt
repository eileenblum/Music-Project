A never ending tale
You lose but never fail
You're going to be the last to learn
To see what's right and wrong
You waited much too long
The truth is somewhere in between
but you've never seen

Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames

Bond of blood

Suppose you change your ways
A simple choice to make
You'll be rewarded by yourself
Possessing all that skill
To use at your own will
You better find another way
Or you'll go astray

Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames

Bond of blood
