The barren land lies empty, no enemies in sight
Though no one ever told them, at midnight they'll get wise
As shadow falls upon them,
no one even dares to speak your name

They'll be given the lesson of their lives
Blood and death will follow

As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise

A shape of hidden power, a presence of true might
Trust in feral knowledge, their fires will die out
Servants to a coward, no one even dares to stand alone

Eyes roll back in terror - the panic starts to rise
Blood and death will follow

As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise

Watch the hunt-god rise
