I've been losing - All my life
Been misused - Endless trife
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole

I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend

Blood stained morning - Darkened skies
Still that longing - No more lies
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole

I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend
Neither wolf nor man
