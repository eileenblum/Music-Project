Marked by death, still living - Never giving in
Future paths uncertain - Fighting till the end

You can betray me
The pain won't break me
Here I stand - I'll never crawl

WarGlad will take me
No mourning on my dying day
Let me burn and enter the hall

Harness arcane power - Oaths with hidden goals
Never beg forgiveness - Death, end and beginning

You can betray me
The pain won't break me
Here I stand - I'll never crawl

WarGlad will take me
No mourning on my dying day
Let me burn and enter the hall
