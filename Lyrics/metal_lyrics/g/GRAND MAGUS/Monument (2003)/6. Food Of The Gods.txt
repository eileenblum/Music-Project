Still searching for a meaning
A search that will be in vain
Disquised and denial
Your crippled life will end in pain

Bolt of lightning
Striking you down
The price of lying
Eternal flame

Now in ever mounting terror
You pay the dues of your betrayal
Vengeance's soaring high now
Nowhere to hide no one is spared

Crushing power
Boiling blood
The call of thunder
Grim sacrifice

Rain coming down
Chaos all around
You will all be devoured alive
You've become
The food of the Gods

Sail!
