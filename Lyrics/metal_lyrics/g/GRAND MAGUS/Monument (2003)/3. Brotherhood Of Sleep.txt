Returning from the exile with their message clear
Keepers of a secret shadow things are near
They only offer you and me eternal life
Look within my friend 'cause it's time to decide

Live, are you gonna live or die
Die, time for you to decide

The root of knowledge lies
Within the wormwood's tale
Another sip will bring you truth to crystal clear
Sacred ritual will illuminate
Look within my friend and embrace your fate

Sleep
Dream
What's your choice?
You have no choice!
Sleep
Dream
What's your choice?
Brotherhood of Sleep
