In a cavern- Of deep despair
All alone- surrounded by stone

The serpent's poison - Searing the skin
A flicker of light - The pyre grows bright

He took the revenge
He fed the flame
Forever in rapture
Forever reign

Baptised in fire
Born within the flame

Thoughts so hollow - Take on a new meaning
His mission apprears - No longer be hallow, my son

Black cauldron boils - Taste the brew
No more lying - Fire, the guiding light

He took the revenge
He fed the flame
Forever in rapture
Forever reign

Baptised in fire
Born within the flame
