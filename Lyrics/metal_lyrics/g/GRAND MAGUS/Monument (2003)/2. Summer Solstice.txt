At the summer solstice you and I will gather round the strong
We'll drink a toast from the cup of blood and realize the truth
Come on now let's see what we can find beyond the stars
Release your soul and tear apart the chains of you heavy load

Fire -Magick
We will find our peace of mind
Fire - Magick
We'll leave this tired world behind

At the summer solstice we will make a bond so strong and true
Hates bodies swirling 'round the golden ripened corn
Come on now let the sacrifice but for all who know
That the Sun and Moon still rule our lives today and evermore

Fire -Magick
We will find our peace of mind
Fire - Magick
We'll leave this tired world behind
