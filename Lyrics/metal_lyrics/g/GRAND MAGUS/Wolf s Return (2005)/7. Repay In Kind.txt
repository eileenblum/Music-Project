Screams - tear the night
No more holding on
Fear - taking flight
Searing sound is born

Piercing your mind
Repaying in kind

I've been released
I've been unleashed
I've called
Now I'm free

I've been released
I've been unleashed
Stealing your mind
Repay in kind

Storm - icy blasts
Ripping through your soul
Eyes - mirthless gaze
Crimson oath is sworn

Piercing your mind
Repaying in kind

I've been released
I've been unleashed
I've been called
Now I'm free

I've been released
I've been unleashed
Stealing your mind
Repay in kind
