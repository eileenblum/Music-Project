Living on the edge of darkness
Gives a man a certain point of view
Never shared by you

Raven's hunger will be stilled
Giving back to nature what I hjad
Joy is the fact, I'm never turning back

Living on - Ever on
Blood Oath
Blood Oath
Living on

One for one and all still one
Honour has a price that must be paid
Time to choose your way
Not your fault that you've been blind
But the time to think is now at hand
Every woman, child and man

Living on - Ever on
Blood Oath
Blood Oath
Living on

Blood Oath
My oath of blood lives on
