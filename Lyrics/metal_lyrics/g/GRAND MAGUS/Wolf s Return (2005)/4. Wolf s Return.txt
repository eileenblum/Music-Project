Wolf's return - Iron veined
We are joined - Scream my name

They believe - Man rules all
No regard - For grey one's call
Misguided hate - Caused by fear
Blame the hunter - But keep weapons near

He'll return - Standing proud
New blood coursing - Better now
Shadow fighter - Iron veined
Fill my soul - Scream his name

Life - A soulless kiss
We are joined - Scream my name

Wolf's return - Iron veined
We are joined - Scream my name
