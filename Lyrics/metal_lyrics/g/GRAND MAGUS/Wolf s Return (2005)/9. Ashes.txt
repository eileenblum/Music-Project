Laughter dies out - Honest and cold
Life drains away - My last will done

Sowing the seed
Filling the need
Taking the lead
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

Sun sinking down - Twilight sets in
Leaving the cage - My testament

Sowing the seed
Filling the need
Taking the lead
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

Filling the need
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die
