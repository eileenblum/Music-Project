Leech of power wanting more as you feed - never satisfied
Crowned usurper wasting time and our wealth - you must go

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

All false methods you're arrogant and vain - above the law
Your blood is feeble a failing line of heirs - down you go

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

Kingslayer rise!

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise
