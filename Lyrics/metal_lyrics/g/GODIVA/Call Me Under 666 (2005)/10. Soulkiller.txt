[Koontz / Garcia]

You never ever leave my darling
You're so deep in love with me
Remember when you're looking so neat - so neat

I'm your demon, you can't harm me
Too many killers inside of me
And when you sleep you will find me stealing your
dreams

Trust my words I'm vicious
Count every soul I stole
I'm your nightmare fiction
Losing my control
Soulkiller

How do you wanna run and hold me
I'm inside your mind and fear
You are the feast for hungry creatures, I'm here

You never ever leave my darling
You're so deep in love with me
And from this time on, and from this time you know my
Plea - my plea

Trust my words I'm vicious
Count every soul I stole
I'm your nightmare fiction
Losing my control
Freakshow

[Solo]

Let me sing for you your lullaby
With my demon helpers by my side
And when you sleep and close your eyes
Your soul's gonna be mine
So, spell out my name, spell it in flames
Spell it out, your pain

Trust my words I'm vicious
Count every soul I stole
I'm your nightmare fiction
Losing my control
Soulkiller

Trust my words I'm vicious
Count every soul I stole
I am your nightmare fiction
Losing my control
Soulkiller
