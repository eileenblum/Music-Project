[Koontz / Garcia]

You are no superstar
You shot my hero
A trace of blood and scars
You turn to zero
You made my night and day
Now twist my ego
You better fade away
Hell sent demon

You're bound to lose
I'm gonna win
You're such a fool
You will drown in sin

Proud proud proud
Proud to be a beast
Proud proud proud
Proud to be a beast

You are no superman
You killed my scarlet
You were my leading man
Now you're my target
A new beast in my life
Bad movie feature
You stab with shiny knives
Horror creature

You're bound to lose
Coz I'm gonna win
You're such a fool
You will drown, you will drown in sin

Proud proud proud
Proud to be a beast
Proud proud proud
Proud to be a beast

Proud proud proud
Proud to be a beast
Proud proud proud
Proud to be a beast

When the darkness falls
The night's your driving force
The chase is on, your last temptation call
All you say, we don't care
You're heading for your dying day

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
