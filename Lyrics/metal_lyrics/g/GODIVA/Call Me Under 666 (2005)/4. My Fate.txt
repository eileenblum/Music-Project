[Lasagni / Garcia]

Hello a new day is born
And flowers are growing no thorns
Lookin' and prayin' and searchin' for harmony

Why did things go wrong
And when will I be strong
Strong enough for you, strong enough for me

Coz I'm hopin' and I'm searchin'
There's no place to be
I'm prayin' and I'm fallin'
Feel the agony

It's my fate
Marchin' feet in disgrace
Take away all my sorrow
It's my hate
My fist in your face
Pray for a better tomorrow

I am no wiser than you
I just can't stop hatin' you
You are here so close, yet you deceive me

Free me from all of this pain
I know that I'm goin' insane
Coz we are lost in a dream
This dream cannot heal me

Coz I'm hopin' and I'm searchin'
There's no place to be
I'm fallin' and I'm hurtin'
I feel the agony

It's my fate
Marchin' feet in disgrace
Take away all my sorrow
It's my hate
My fist in your face
Pray for a better tomorrow
