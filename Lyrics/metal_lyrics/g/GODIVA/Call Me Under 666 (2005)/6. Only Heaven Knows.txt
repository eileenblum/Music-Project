[Fernandez / Garcia]

You have true wisdom
You're a real superman in size
You're selling dreams on the horizon
Which won't be realised

You never gonna be arrested
You never gonna be a star
I will raise the stakes on you
When your walls break down, you are
You are down and out
You are down and out

Faster and faster comes disaster
Only heaven knows
Bring me back into your veins
Faster and faster comes your master
Maybe heaven shows

Bring it back into your veins
Bring it back into your veins

You form mindcycles
You're a real leading man indeed
You're stealing souls from your disciples
Who are left behind to bleed

You never gonna be arrested
You never gonna be a star
I will raise the stakes on you
When your walls break down, you are...
You are down and out
You are down and out

Faster and faster comes disaster
Only heaven knows
Bring me back into your veins
Faster and faster comes master
Maybe heaven shows

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Bring it back into your veins

[Chorus]

May be heaven
Maybe heaven
Maybe heaven shows
