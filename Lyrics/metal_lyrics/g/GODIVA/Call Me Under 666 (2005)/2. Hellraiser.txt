[Lasagni / Garcia]

Misuse our children as slaves
We must be all insane
We listen to guns around
And watch the world go down

When children are crying
Do we hear silent tears
When children are dying
Do we feel lonely fears

We can't go on like before - no
We have to change this world of war
No more war

Hell Hellraisers
Fight till the end of the time
Hell Hellraisers
Will we ever change our minds

And till the war is over
We sleep in beds of pain
While from the blood grow flowers
We're gonna turn insane

When children are crying
Do we hear silent tears
When children are dying
Do we feel lonely fears

We can't go on like before - no
We have to change this world of war
No more war

Hell Hellraisers
Fight till the end of the time
Hell Hellraisers
Will we ever change our minds

Hell Hellraisers
Fight till the end of the time
Hell Hellraisers
Will we ever change our minds

[Solo]

Your lies are no salvation
Just useless words of threat
A remedy's alteration
A brainwash in your head
There's no atomic war conclusion
Deep inside your mind
There's no truth in absolution
Your truth makes you blind

[Chorus x2]
