[Lasagni / Garcia]

Your world must be broken
You're making friends with slayers
Your Holy God is a token
Gives no answer to your prayers

You ride in the dark, to find your own spark
But nothing will ease your pain
You bark at the moon, but help's coming soon
And nothing you do will be in vain... in vain

Thousand miles under the sea
You try to hide away
Thousand miles up in the sky
You try to find your way

You lie in the dark and lick off your mark
You, my little bird of prey
Your hate makes you blind, my help is devine
You are welcome to my land, please stay, please stay...
Please stay

What ever you need
And when your lost and broken
Someone is waiting
So call me under 666
No matter you're frightened
No time for revelation
I'll fix your broken wings
So call me under 666

Tell me more about you
Your soul belongs to me
Call me under 666

[Solo]

What ever you need
And when your lost and broken
Someone is waiting
So call me under 666
No matter you're frightened
No time for revelation
I'll fix your broken wings
So call me under 666

What ever you need
And when your lost and broken
Someone is waiting
So call me under 666
No matter you're frightened
No time for revelation
I'll fix your broken wings
So call me under 666
