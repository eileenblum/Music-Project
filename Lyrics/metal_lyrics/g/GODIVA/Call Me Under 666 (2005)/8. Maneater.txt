[Koontz / Fernandez / Garcia]

You don't have a clue
Why I'm on the hunt
Listen to your fool
You're the chosen one

I am hunting everyday
Shooting arrows to your heart
And my little bird of prey
I'll rip your heart apart

Here we are
Eye to eye
Back to back
In the night

Maneater Maneater Maneater
Face to face

You will be my feast
When I'm through with you
Coz I want some meat
I want you, want someone new

Now I'm tasting your sweet blood
Little Darling don't you see
This is what you get for love
So you better let it be

Here we are
Eye to eye
Back to back
In the night

Maneater Maneater Maneater
Face to face
Maneater Maneater Maneater
On the chase

[Solo]

I am hunting everyday
Shooting arrows to your heart
And, my little bird of prey
I'll rip your heart apart

Here we are
Eye to eye
Back to back
In the night

[Chorus x2]
