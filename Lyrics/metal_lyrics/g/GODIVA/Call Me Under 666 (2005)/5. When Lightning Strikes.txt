[Lasagni / Garcia]

Sometimes you've been straight
Sometimes you've been blown away
I can't see the sign
Hidden by your winning smile

Sometimes I'm feeling great
Sometimes you cover me with hate
I don't need you by my side
And when you're gone, I'll be alright

I need somebody who is stronger
And I know my feelings gonna rise

When lightning strikes
And hearts are blinded by the light
I know that our love is dying
When lightning strikes
And dreams will fade into the night
There's no, no reason to keep trying

When Lightning Strikes

Sometimes you've been bright
Sometimes you just blow my mind
I don't need your love
Holding me with iron gloves

Sometimes I'm feeling high
Sometimes you make this grown man cry
I don't need you anymore
And I'll be fine, when You're gone

I need somebody who is stronger
And I know my feelings gonna rise

When lightning strikes
And hearts are blinded by the light
I know that our love is dying
When lightning strikes
And dreams will fade into the night
There's no, no reason to keep trying

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
