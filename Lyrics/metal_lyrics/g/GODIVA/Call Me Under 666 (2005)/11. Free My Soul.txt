[Lasagni / Garcia]

I can deal with my emotions
But I can't deal with these cold enemies
Maybe I'm too strange with my notions
My old friends, even old friends they blind me

My doom everyday, I am wondering where to stay
It's my goal, it's my aim
Like a devouring flame
Inside me - you don't see

I'm cursing this world for what's going on
With these thousands of bloody wars
You will bleed and suffer but you won't see
Till you're judged for insanity

Free my soul, free my life
I'm nothing human alive
Bring back love from grave
Gonna find myself
Hope you will be there this time
Free my life, free my life
Hope you will be, hope you will be there in time

I wish I could find a remedy
To cure your evil minds
But noone will ever defeat your disease
Or condemn you - what a surprise

I'm cursing this world for what's going on
With these thousands of bloody wars
You will bleed and suffer but you won't see
Till you're judged for insanity

Free my soul, free my life
I'm nothing human alive
Bring back love from grave
Gonna find myself
Hope you will be there this time
Free my life, free my life
Hope you will be, hope you will be there in time
