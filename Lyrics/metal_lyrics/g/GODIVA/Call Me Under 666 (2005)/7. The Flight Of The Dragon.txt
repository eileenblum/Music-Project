[Fernandez / Garcia]

Another land in a world of gloom
Behind the curtain of time
Flowers grow but never bloom
Black rainbows in the sky

And we see the magician
Deprived of his might
Locked away in the deep dark dungeon
By the king and his knights

Spare the wizard from this hell
Free him from his spell
And darkness disappears
He, he will point out on the sign
Appearing in the sky
Rising in the east

When we see the wagon
Glazing like the sun
Hauled, hauled by the twelve white dragons
The spell is undone

Higher and higher... on swings of fire
Dragons will carry the light
Higher and higher - on swings of fire
Dragons light up through the sky

Forever lost in the citadel
Hidden by the castle's strong walls
Coz deep down in the wishing well
They hide the wizard's wand

Yet we see the magician
Gaining back his might
Released from the deep dark dungeon
He defeats king and his knights

Spare the wizard from this hell
Free him from his spell
And darkness disappears
He, he will point out on the sign
Appearing in the sky
Rising in the east

When we see the wagon
Glazing like the sun
Hauled, hauled by the twelve white dragons
The spell is undone... the spell is undone

Higher and higher... on swings of fire
Dragons will carry the light
Higher and higher - on swings of fire
Dragons light up through the sky

Higher and higher... on swings of fire
Dragons will carry the light
Higher and higher - on swings of fire
Dragons light up through the sky
