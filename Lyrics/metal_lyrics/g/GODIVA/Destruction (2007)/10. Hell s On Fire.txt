I see you playin' in the sun
Your pretty little school dress on
Like working under cover
You'll never be another
You're always teachers' number one
Passion slows me down

I see your real face shinin' through
Coz ev'rything is up to you

You are the devil's daughter
And when the day is over
You turn into a loaded gun
Passion's growing now

Try to refuse but the yearning for you blows my mind

Hell's on fire
Cruel desire
Hell's on fire
Big time liar

You are the devil in disguise
Your soul is mean and cold as ice
Temptin', brandin', always demandin'
Why can't you keep your hands of me
Passion brings me down

Try to refuse but the yearning for you blows my mind

Hell's on fire
Cruel desire
Hell's on fire
Big time liar
Hells on fire

Hell's on fire
Cruel desire
Hell's on fire
Big time liar
Hell's on fire
Cruel desire
Hell's on fire
Big time liar
