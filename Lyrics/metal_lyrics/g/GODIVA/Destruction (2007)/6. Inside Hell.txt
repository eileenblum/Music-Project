You don't know my name
No need to know
I am the dark sick blind hate
Bad to the bone

I will destroy all holy - insurrection day
And on my day of glory - resurrection day

I will be awaitin' you
Rippin' you apart

Inside out
Inside out
Inside out
Inside hell

I am disaster
Lethal and bold
I am the evil master
Your final call

I will destroy all holy - insurrection day
And on my day of glory - resurrection day

I will be awaitin' you
Welcome to my home, I'll be waiting

Inside hell
Inside hell
Inside hell
Inside hell

Inside hell
Inside hell
Inside hell
Inside hell

Inside hell, inside hell, inside hell, inside hell...
