No speed limit
No red lights
Hear the squealin'
Of the tires

I'm living for
The thrill of speed
Coz nothing else
Feeds my needs

Race down the highway, right down in the middle
Let's hear the devil, playing his fiddle
Here comes the rebel, never be a quitter
Don't tell me, my life ends on a litter

Put the pedal to the metal
You are a faint, I am a winner
Put the pedal to the metal
You are the saint, I am the sinner

No stoppin' me
I'm too fast
My life is speed
What a blast

I'm living for
The thrill of speed
Nothing else
Fulfils my needs

Race down the highway, right down in the middle
Let's hear the devil, playing his fiddle
Here comes the rebel, never be a quitter
Don't tell me my life ends on a litter

Put the pedal to the metal
You are a faint, I am a winner
Put the pedal to the metal
You are the saint, I am the sinner

Race down the highway, right down in the middle
Let's hear the devil, playing his fiddle
Here comes the rebel, never be a quitter
Don't tell me my life, my life ends on a litter

Put the pedal to the metal
You are a faint, I am a winner
Put the pedal to the metal
You are the saint, I am the sinner
