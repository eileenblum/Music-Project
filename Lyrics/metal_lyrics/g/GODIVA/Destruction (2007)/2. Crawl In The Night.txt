Hell... yeah...
Sometimes you're coming from out of the dark
Master of madness and harm

Roaring like thunder, won't frighten my friend
Listen to what I say

You got the power to crack up the sky
We got the will to survive

Calling all demons won't save you today
You will go down in flames

Here we are, eye to eye
No chance for you to survive

Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Tell me why
Crawl in the night, crawl in the, night
Time to die

Under the gun, we're out of control
Stronger than ever before

You have to know, you're fighting in vain
We are your fatal bane

We got your demons to stand by our side
Ready and willing to fight

Shadows of warriors will follow your way
Waiting for you to decay

Here we are, eye to eye
No chance for you to survive.

Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Tell me why
Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Time to die

When my forces gain control
Your Reich begins to fall
And when you draw your final breath
We will celebrate your death

Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Tell me why
Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Time to die
Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Tell me why
Crawl in the night, crawl in the night
Time to die
