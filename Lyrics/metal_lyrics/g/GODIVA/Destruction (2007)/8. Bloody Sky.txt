Too many sorrows make you blind
Dark visions hold on to your mind
But you fly higher than before
So many tears will pass you by
Eleven harmonies you cry
You can't stand your life no more

But we, we built a city, the city that burns
And we feed the flame
Coz we feel the hurt
We keep holding the pain
You and I, flying high
Searching for rainbows in the burning sky
You and I, tell me why

There is no rainbow in the bloody sky

Too many worries make you sore
Dark powers hold on to your soul
But you keep flying through the skies
So Many fears will cut you deep
A silent melody you hear
When you're walking down the line

But we, we built a city, the city that burns
And we feed the flame
Coz we feel the hurt
We keep holding the pain
You and I, flying high
Searching for rainbows in the burning sky
You and I, tell me why

There is no rainbow in the bloody sky

You and I, flying high
Searching for rainbows in the burning sky
You and I, tell me why
There is no rainbow in the bloody sky

You and I, flying high
Searching for rainbows in the burning sky
You and I, tell me why
There is no rainbow in the bloody sky
You and I... flying high...
