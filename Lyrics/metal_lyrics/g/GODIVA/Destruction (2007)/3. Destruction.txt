Face to face, eye to eye
Anger in my mind
Glare at you, cross the line
I will hurt your pride

You feel the same, it's not a game
We rumble for glory or shame
We're gonna win, you're bound to fail
Surrender to your battered fate

Destruction
Hate, rage, body check
Fight, strike, sudden death
You'll end in disaster
You'll lose, I'm the master
Broken bones, bloody scars
Anguish in my heart
Feel the punch, heavy brawl
I will break your jaw

You feel the same, it's not a game
We rumble for glory or shame
We're gonna win, you're bound to fail
Surrender to your battered fate

Destruction
Hate, rage, body check
Fight, strike, sudden death

Destruction
You'll end in disaster
You'll lose, I'm the master

Destruction
Hate, rage, body check
Fight, strike, sudden death

Destruction
You'll end in disaster
You'll lose, I'm the master

You feel the same; it's not a game
We rumble for glory or shame
We're gonna win, you're bound to fail
Surrender to your battered fate, I will bring you

Destruction
Hate, rage, body check
Fight, strike, sudden death

Destruction
You'll end in disaster
You'll lose, I'm the master

Destruction
Hate, rage, body check
Fight, strike, sudden death

Destruction
You'll end in disaster
You'll lose, I'm the master
