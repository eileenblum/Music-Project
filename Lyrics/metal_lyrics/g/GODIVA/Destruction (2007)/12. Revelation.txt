[bonus track]

We've been around for the longest time
Always pushed aside by your messed up minds
It's time now, heavy metal soldier, load your gun
Stand up for your rights, the revival has come

We will rise again
Under my command
Join me, join me, we will rise again

Better you step back and release the crown

Oh-oh revelation
We gonna rock your world right into the ground
Oh-oh revelation
Besides my music cries out proud and vain
Oh-oh-revelation
You know by tomorrow Heavy Metal prevails
Oh-oh-revelation

We will rise again
Under my command
Join me, join me, we will rise again

We will rise again
Under my command
Join me, join me, we will rise again

We'll stay around for the longest time
And Heavy Metal rules the world until the end of the time

Oh-oh revelation
Oh-oh revelation
Oh-oh revelation
You better release the crown
Oh-oh revelation
We're gonna rock, bringin' you down to the ground

We will rise again
Under my command
Join me, join me
we will rise again
