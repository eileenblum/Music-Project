So many wars, have passed us by
You and I, we're so blind
Fighting hard for freedom which won't last

People are people, crossing the lines
Telling us lies, rollin' the dice
We had it all, way back in the past

It's so hard to believe that it won't be the same again soon
With the shadows of war creeping all over you

After the war comes the rain again
After the war
After the war comes the pain

Time after time, it happens again
Masters of bloodshed, I know you can
Announcing the war and leaving us to die
Broken men in despair, you soon are aware
You'll never be free and nobody cares
There's nowhere to run and there's no place to hide

It's so hard to believe that it won't be the same again soon
When the shadows of war creeping all over you

Higher, desire, coz I feel fire, open the fire again

After the war comes the rain again
After the war
After the war comes the pain

Higher, desire, coz I feel fire, open the fire again

After the war comes the rain again
After the war
After the war comes the pain
Comes the pain again
