You never get to know
The secrets of my soul
You think that I'm not strong
But I will prove you wrong

I never march alone
Your soul will come along
Coz I am on the run

Let all the fires burn
For you it's red alert
I'm on the way to victory

You will walk on the path of your pain tonight

And when the saints are falling
Your troubled times are calling
I am a warrior rising from my grave
And when the saints are falling
And holy men are crawling
I will be rising with a vicious blade - vicious blade

Remember all the times
You pushed me for aside
I'll get you one by one
You'll be the next one gone

I don't need to know
I don't care no more
Remember all the lies
I know it's much too late, you're feeling all my pain,
and my time has come tonight

You'll see, I'm your destiny my friend

And when the saints are falling
Your troubled times are calling
I am a warrior rising from my grave
And when the saints are falling
And holy men are crawling
I will be rising with a vicious blade
Vicious blade, vicious blade, vicious blade, vicious blade

And when the saints are falling
Your troubled times are calling
I am a warrior rising from my grave
And when the saints are falling
And holy men are crawling
I will be rising with a vicious blade

And when the saints are falling
And holy men are crawling
I'll be a warrior with a vicious blade - vicious blade
