I think I'm gonna go insane
Don't need nobody to explain
I've seen too much, I feel ashamed
'bout your political obey

I hear the drums in the night
When the darkness arrives
See the light in the night
Of my allies

United, united we stand
United, united we stand,
To live our lives under our command
United we stand

I think I'm gonna lose control
Don't need your speeches anymore
Your domination's on the wane
I feel the anger in the air

I hear the drums in the night
When the darkness arrives
See the light in the night
When my allies arrive

United, united we stand
United, united we stand
To live our lives under our command
United we stand

I hear the drums in the night
When the darkness arrives
United, united we stand
United, united we stand
To live our lives under our command
United we stand

United, united we stand
United, united we stand
To live our lives under our command
Under our command
