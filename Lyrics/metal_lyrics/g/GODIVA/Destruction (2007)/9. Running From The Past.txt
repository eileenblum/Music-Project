Always try to run from your cheatin'
Hiding in the dark from your spell
Trying hard to hide all those feelings
Why don't you release me from hell

My whole life was pretending
Now I want to get back at my fate
I try so hard to achieve it
But it always will be just the same

Running from the past
Running running
Running from the demons of the past
Running from the past
Running running
Running from the demons of the past

Nothing made me see you were lying
Always did believe what you said
Somehow you make me feel like dying
Somebody should end your thread

My whole life was pretending
Now I want to get back at my fate
I try so hard to achieve it
But it always will stay just the same

Running from the past
Running running
Running from the demons of the past
Running from the past
Running running
Running from the demons of the past

My whole life was pretending
Now I want to get back at my fate
I try so hard to achieve it
But it will always stay just the same

Running from the past
Running running
Running from the demons of the past
Running from the past
Running running
Running from the demons of the past
