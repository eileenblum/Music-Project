[de Angelis]

runnin' for a flash, to get the needles straight in your veins
you're never gonna win, you're never gonna sing, you swim in blood
you will be dead soon, down and out

there are so many doors that you open in your head, pay the price
the day will come he'll cruise you really down to the ground
now you are lost and down and out

I know a fire still burns in your heart

one shot - feel the fire
one shot- destroys body and soul
there is a long way out from home shit home

one day you realize that you're hypnotized in your life
the sweat gets out
but your flame's expired, it's too late
now it's too late

you're doin' everything to get money in your hand, you sell yourself
and then you're playin' god infecting all the kids, heartless and cold
all mothers will be cryin' tears

I know a fire still burns in your heart

one shot - feel the fire
one shot - destroys body and soul
there is a long way out from home shit home
one shot - feel the fire
destroys body and soul
there is a long way out from home shit home
