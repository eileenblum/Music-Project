[de Angelis]

we hide a bloody nation
thank god for TV news
it keeps your eyes wide open
in shit we're diggin'

our hate will keep survivin'
so many living dead
they lost their bright time future
just a step to the edge

what a rise and fall
what a rise and fall

razorblade romantic
razorblade from hell
a sentiment of danger
a holy curse I sell

they sleep their sleep in anger
they wanna be someone
there is a big occasion
to show the power

what a rise and fall
what a rise and fall

razorblade romantic
razorblade from hell
a sentiment of danger
a holy curse I sell
