[de Angelis]

we're all soldiers for a lifetime
we fight, spittin' blood, we run
there's no guarantee for exile
one thing we never lose
rock'n'roll never never dies in us
stay loud and proud my friends
put techno, rap, to the flames

ride with me deeper
rock with me creepers

hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll- hell
hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll- hell

faithless everyday we're stalkin'
restless and blind we're bound
watch this bloody masturbation
there is no solid ground
rock'n'roll never never dies in us
fuck hell and free your mind
put all that rap to the flames

ride with me deeper
rock with me creepers

hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll- hell
hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll
hell yeah let the tanks roll- hell
