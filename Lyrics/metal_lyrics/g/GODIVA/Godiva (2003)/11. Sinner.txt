[de Koontz]

so take a look at your sins, your life
did you ever ask about the reason
you're gettin' ass kicks for your care you will give
fightin' for money, fightin' for love, believe

come back sinner you're ready to fight
come back sinner, goodbye and goodnight, yeah
come back sinner the time is just right
come back sinner you're ready to fight, yeah

life's a bitch and life is a sin
feel the heat of hate, ready for revenge
there are no thanks no grateful smile, arrogance
a fist in your face when you try to help

come back sinner you're ready to fight
come back sinner, goodbye and goodnight, yeah
come back sinner the time is just right
come back sinner you're ready to fight, yeah
