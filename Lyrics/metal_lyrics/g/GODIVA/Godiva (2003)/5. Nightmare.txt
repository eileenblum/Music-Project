[de Angelis/Koontz/Gander]

every day I wish you were dead
spit fire in your darkroom
he's screamin' and fightin' in those walls
and no one hears your crying

where is the love - where is the love I need
where is the love - break down the walls around me
where is the love   touch me deeply as you can

why you wanna tell me
'til I'm dead and gone
why you wanna break me
why you wanna tell me 
'til I'm dead and gone
why you wanna break me

the book of memories won't close
they are the stars in this sick world
now it's over the nightmare begins
you lose the ground with the morning

where is the love - where is the love I need
where is the love - break down the walls around me
where is the love - touch me deeply as you can

why you wanna tell me
'til I'm dead and gone
why you wanna break me
why you wanna tell me 
'til I'm dead and gone 
why you wanna break me

she was the one for you
but she played a game
that split your heart in two
in the name of your love
in the name of your love
in the name of your love
in the name of your love

in the name of love you will die
the nightmare starts to rise
your risin' fire wants to see how you're bleedin'
too much for body and soul

where is the love.......
