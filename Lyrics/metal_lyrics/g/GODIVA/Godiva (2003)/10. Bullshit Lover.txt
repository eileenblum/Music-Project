[de Angelis]

I'm sick and tired of your excuse
my drunken pig what you've done to me
for sixteen years we're livin' in hell
the time is here, I let you feel my spell

in my dreams, in my dreams I kill ya
in my brain my knife is gonna thrill ya
in my head a plan for an act of violence
cmon here right now, I cut your fuckin' thing

there is no hope that keeps you goin'
and there's no hope for a nice big family

Bullshit Lover, terminator lover
I hope, I find your sweet ass sometimes undercover
Bullshit Lover, number one destroyer
I hope I find your sweet ass

well I dont need a Jekyll or Hyde
and I dont need a midnight sex machine
just need a man for me and my kids
the time is here I let you feel my spell

in my dreams, in my dreams I kill ya
in my brain my knife is gonna thrill ya
in my head a plan for an act of violence
cmon here right now, I cut your fuckin' thing

there is no hope that keeps you goin'
and there's no hope for a nice big family

Bullshit Lover, terminator lover
I hope I find your sweet ass sometimes undercover
Bullshit Lover, number one destroyer
I hope I find your sweet ass
