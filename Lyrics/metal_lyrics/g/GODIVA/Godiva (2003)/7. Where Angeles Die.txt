[Tom Naumann/de Angelis]

come, come with me, to a trip into eternity
the nightmare is callin' so near, so far
hell, hell awaits where the blood red journey ends
the end's comin' closer
your death, your pain

the king of madness, to blind to see
the queen of sadness, dies to be free

Say your prayer and take my hand
I'll show you the evil land
where the demons dare to fly and angels die

take, take my hand, I will lead you to my land
it's your destination so real, so real
come, come with me, to a place where you'll never be free
the wasteland of dream world
die young, die fast

the king of madness, to blind to see
the queen of sadness, dies to be free

say your prayer and take my hand
I'll show you the evil land
where the demons dare to fly and angels die
say your prayer and take my hand
I'll show you the evil land
where the demons dare to fly and angels die
