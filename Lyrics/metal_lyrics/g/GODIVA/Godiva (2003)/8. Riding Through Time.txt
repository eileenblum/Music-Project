[Gander/Koontz]

remind me, you will see us, through the fire, your future
no mercy, one liar, soul dealer, hellfire
down under, disorder, we'll show you damnation
no system controls you
defenceless everywhere, every move and step

this is a never ending nightmare
this is a never ending nightmare

riding through time
leave the truth behind
darkest hate forever lost my fate
walkin' through the flames
for real truth you'll fight
and never say never ever believe in trust

hellraiser is huntin' every way in aggression
daydreamer, corruption all around in this world
downunder, disorder, we'll show you damnation
no system controls you
defenceless everywhere, every move and step

this is a never ending nightmare
this is a never ending nightmare

riding through time
leave the truth behind
darkest hate forever lost my fate
walkin' through the flames
for real truth you'll fight
and never say never ever believe in trust
