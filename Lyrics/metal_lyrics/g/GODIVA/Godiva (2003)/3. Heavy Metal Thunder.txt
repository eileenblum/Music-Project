[de Angelis]

what a cool day for a ride
I let the sun in my head
I press the pedal to the metal
let the thunder roar

yeaaaaaaaaaah

heavy music, beat goes through me
I'm feeling so much better
I turn the volume up to ten
I'm drivin' straight to hell

I'm breakin' through
I'm just a child of rats
no sorrows now
the world of thunder leads my way

heavy metal thunder
heavy metal fire
heavy metal thunder
and I'm a heavy metal breather

far away from good and bad
my hell on wheels keeps drivin'
no one stops me on my way
I'm cruisin' straight to hell

can't hold back the rythm got me
I raise my fist I salute u
and all the demons in my head
get my middle finger

I'm breakin' through
I'm just a child of rats
no sorrows now
the world of thunder leads my way

heavy metal thunder
heavy metal fire
heavy metal thunder
and I'm a heavy metal breater
heavy metal thunder
and I never goin' under
heavy metal thunder
and I'm a heavy metal breather
