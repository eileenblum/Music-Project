[de Angelis]

here I stand now, I'm feeling alone
no one's by my side
eternal darkness surrounds my heart
my trust says goodbye to the brave old world

and it goes on and on and on and on and on
and it goes on and on and on and on and on

cold blood runs through my veins
look what you've done to me now
cold blood runs through my veins
don't try to touch my soul in the light
cold blood

depression's got me, I'm feelin' sad
there is no way out
caught in a room without a door
will somebody save me, can you hear my call

and it goes on and on and on and on and on
and it goes on and on and on and on and on

cold blood runs through my veins
look what you've done to me now
cold blood runs through my veins
don't try to touch my soul in the light
cold blood runs through my veins
look what you've done to me now
cold blood runs through my nights
don't try to touch my soul in the light
