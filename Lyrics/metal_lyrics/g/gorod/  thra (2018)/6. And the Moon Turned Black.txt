Here comes the dark and heavy matter
That reveals the blackest part of inner splendor
This is the greatest energy to conquer
A darkness to dissipate, a karma to purge
The black moon embodies a dizzying loneliness
The utter void... which is none other than fullness by density
An imaginary spot in the sky
With an endless power of attraction and absorption
Here comes the essence of dark and evil passion
The raging joy breaking all the laws of the universe
The most hostile energy to overcome
A karma to purge
The black flame can give birth to the only real free will
Here comes the dark and heavy matter
That reveals the blackest part of inner splendor
This is the greatest energy to conquer
A darkness to dissipate, a karma to purge
Wish you were here when the moon turned black...
Wish you'll be there when the black flame will burn bright...
She is the one who says no, the one none can restrain
Disobeying the laws to claim the fullness of desire
Preferring to die of thirst by the fountain
Rather than leading a dutiful life without pleasure
Here comes the dark and heavy matter
That reveals the blackest part of inner splendor
This is the greatest energy to conquer
A darkness to dissipate, a karma to purge
Patrones of the process of initiation
Governing the deepest desire of the individual
Whose fascination awakens the will for knowledge
The Great Swallower of the Unicorn
With an endless power of attraction... and absorption
Wish you'll be there when the moon turns black
