There were so many men who wanted to experience the asceticism of eremetic life
I know all too well that following a society one has not chosen
Can easily lead the purest souls from virtue to vice
On this day I met a man
Who wanted to become the favorite of the gods
So he left his family and possessions to retire to the desert
I take charge of eating all the sins
Can't you see the divine feces around my lips?
He sat upon a high rock where he stayed day and night
So as not to be distracted by his friends and by his wife
I take charge of eating all the sins
Can't you see the divine feces around my mouth?
So I wanted to put his virtue to the test
I take charge of eating all the sins
Can't you see the divine feces around my mouth?
Smoking mirror, will look after you
To make sure nothing defies the purity of your soul
Let Liquid Gold be mine... From the Filth I make you clean...
Brother, I'm really amazed by your virtue,
I want to comfort you, all the pain you've endured so long
How can I reach you to talk to you?
Unaware of the goddess' cunning
He came down from his rock
I take charge of eating all the sins
Can't you see the divine feces around my lips?
Thus was the end of Yappan's virtue
I take charge of eating all the sins
Can't you see the divine feces around my mouth?
Smoking mirror, was looking after you
But you failed! Let him cut your head off!
Smoking mirror, was looking after you
Now a scorpion, you can hide under your stone forever
