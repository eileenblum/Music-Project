Behold the light!
Some say you are deprived of your own light
Maybe too many consider only what our eyes perceive is real
Yet you are admired by all peoples on Earth
You have more names than one can imagine
You are the object of the most ancient cults
The perfect icon of dependence
The perfect icon epitome of change
You are enslaved as much as you dominate
But without you nothing can grow down here
You are the part of our subconscious that drives us to create
You drive us to create!
You are our light unseen!
The infantile and animistic side of the psyche
Our animal soul too often rejected
A cosmic symbol extended to all culture
From immemorial times up to the present day
A sign of beauty in the dark immensity
The perfect icon of dependence
The perfect icon epitome of change
You are enslaved as much as you dominate
But without you nothing can grow down here
You are the part of our subconscious that drives us to create
You are our light unseen!
None should be deprived of the light that you bring inside each of us!
None should be deprived of the light you might bring inside each of us...
The perfect icon of dependence
The perfect icon epitome of change
You are enslaved as much as you dominate
But without you nothing can grow down here
You are the part of our subconscious that drives us to create
You are our light unseen!
