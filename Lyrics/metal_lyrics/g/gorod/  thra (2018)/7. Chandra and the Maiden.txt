On this night, I found a way to cancel my sentence
I saw this appealing lady who was taking a midnight bath
And wanted to get in touch with the star
I made her drink the essence of immortality / The great experience of bliss
I could feel her senses being troubled then tenfold increased
The great experience of bliss
But I'll never forget the grievance caused by the loss of my favorite
The only one among the 27 who was able to temper my need
It was irrational to cherish so many women at the same time
There can be only one... and she's my choice
A divine rape... a sacred rapture
Brought by the majestic flight of the eagle / The great experience of bliss
This panacea allows to reach the divine / The great experience of bliss
I could not resist her flawless beauty when our eyes met
Her angelic face instantly delighted me
Soma permeates the soul and sets the body of fire / The great experience of bliss
Then we will be undivided for all eternity / The great experience of bliss
Your family will claim a blooming destiny / What a chance to seize!
And one day, your lineage will finally be Kshatriya / Seize your chance to rise!
A divine rape... a sacred rapture
Filled with godly love... isn't this the best way to reach heaven?
