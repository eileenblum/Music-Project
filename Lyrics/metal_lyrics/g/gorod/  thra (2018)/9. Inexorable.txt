I am the passing time and night
Counting months and days
Born of my father's eye
I have the gift to control time
Slowing it down here, speeding it up
Or freezing it in another place
I do govern the course of seasons
So that the harvest might feed all people on earth
My destiny was inexorable
All this was premeditated
Our destiny was inexorable
All this has occured so that we are separated... forever
I have the power to illuminate night and darkness
Looking after those who respect the cycle of nature
I am the remedy for all sickness
No matter their class, people pray for me
But the wicked gods set a trap for me
The One Who Owns the Meal organized a feast
Turning to the oceans, she vomited fish
Turning to the fields, she regurgitated rice
Everything she prepared was made from body wastes
Who would not have been disgusted by this abomination?
I killed this horrid woman
But my beloved sister couldn't stand it, then rejected me forever
My destiny was inexorable
All this was premeditated
Our destiny was inexorable
We are separated forever
