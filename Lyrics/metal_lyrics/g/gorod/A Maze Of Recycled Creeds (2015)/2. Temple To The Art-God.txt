I heed the warrior's call
It's time to act now
Let us cross the dagger and the rose
Let us form a holy militia
To revive the nobility of mankind

Angels at our side
O Parsifal
Now let your trumpets blow

Here we restore
The cult of the ideal
In all it's splendor
Religion became art to talk to the masses
Art shall turn into religion
To speak to the elite

O Parsifal
Now let your trumpets blow

Open the door of the temple
The temple to the Art-God

If the thinkers crystallize reflection
Come what may
Artists must glorify reality

Conquer
We have to conquer the city of light
Conquer
We might be few against many
But i can feel 
But i can feel the angel's breath

By our side
While some deride my exertions
I am the harbinger of a new religion

Beauty is the purpose
Art is the means
The only single rule to follow
Is the ideal

Angels are at our side
O Parsifal
Now let your trumpets blow

Here we restore
The cult of the ideal
In all it's splendor
We shelter only what summons all perfections
The lordy rapture will survive
The piety of the past

O Parsifal
Now let your trumpets blow

Open the door of the temple
The temple to the Art-God
