What a pleasing game to change one's own ancestry
Especially when your last name suffers a lack of majesty

You're surely not the son of Bel
But rather the one who holds the spade

Pretending to teach the government of existence
Soley a self-proclaimed prophet claiming ignorance

But what is more attractive than becoming a Magus or a Fairy?
How to give meaning to one's own life when one feels good for nothing?
Those of your kind know how to give false praise
In the process of indoctrination

In the scheme of self-glorification
You couldn't resist this inclination:
Overusing random and puzzling patterns
To please the reckless ones

But if you really want to honor your lineage
Now grab a spade and dig into yourself

Who can lead a life on ready-made principles?
Who can be satisfied with a ready-made truth?
A ready-made reality!
Swimming with the tide...

The time has come for you to honor your lineage
Now grab a spade and dig into yourself
You're surely not the son of Bel
But rather the one who holds the spade
