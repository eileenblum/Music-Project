Let me rejoice your soul

Holy Baptism made us the children of God
Society dedicated us to evil
In constant conflict with our culture
Only faith can keep us away from the vultures

There is no wisdom without deprival
No salvation for the rebels
Let me entice you into another world
We will teach you the government of yourself
And show you the way to light
So let me enlighten your mind
Let me rejoice your soul

Seek only the magical power of your inner excellence
Improve yourself and become radiant
And as the Sun, heat latent ideal life around you
Come to me/ Be my disciple/ See the light
Forsake the seven bad habits

Cut yourself off from your peers
Otherwise you will suffer without growing
Deny the commonwealth, forget all others, to rise to personality

"Then you shall see the radiant;
Your heart shall thrill and exult,
Because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,
The wealth of nations shall come to you" Isaiah 60:5

We own the rational knowledge that will engage the Renewal of Society
I own the spiritual essence that will lead to the Renewal of Man
I am the heir of Bel, the demiurge
The Lord of the world
The master of all the lands
I do belong to the holy Order that committed my fate,
That will commit your fate

And you'll know an extraordinary destiny...
