Sacred vows are made to be broken
Three hundred years later, the grave will open

For there is an order to reclaim
We are back from oblivion again

Born from the poor fellow-soldiers

The world is going through a serious crisis
Divided by financial conflicts
Holy wars are sowing terror and chaos
Let us break the silence
As science is Focused on the material
The living standards continue to fall
Time has come to ask for more humanity
Let us break the silence

For there is an Order to reclaim
We are back from oblivion again
Born from the poor fellow-soldiers
A traveling mendicant order

But sacred laws are made to be broken

Reveal our ambition
Revive the mendicant order... now!
Tax exemption... the oath of poverty
Immunity from persecution... the Vow of Chastity
And no Submission... Obedience? To the secular power Death is so great... Death is so great...
Death is so great that nine would accuse us
Of seeking victory... of seeking another end
Reveal our ambition
Revive the poor fellow-soldiers

After the King's denial, the order became mendicant again
And the poor fellow-bankers were condemned to burn at the stake...
