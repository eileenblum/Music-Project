Never forget that a mage is not a priest
All sins are granted, provided one gains experience
Daily introspection, prayer and meditation
Will soon lead you from passion to Holiness

It is vital to know the boundaries of love in order to not mislead oneself...

Concerning love, disappointments are inevitable
A lover will have nothing to offer... but his own delusion
Wisdom advises you to watch only from afar the entire worldly fantasy

One's partner should never go beyond their wonderful task
As a second fiddle to the sexual pair
It is vital to know the boundaries of love in order to not mislead oneself...
Let us await our Chymical Wedding
When our soul will rise and marry God for eternity
Utter incontinence is not an obligation
Love, and the suffering it causes reveal
A long windy road to inner perfection
From passion to Holiness

Choose your partners wisely
Because as a disciple, you are sentenced to remain defensive
Offer no clarity to general cowardice
Flee judgement, contempt and mockery
Don't ever be compliant

Let your most passionate feelings rise and become unreal
Thus you will unveil almost nothing to misfortune

Let us await our Chymical Wedding
When our soul will rise and marry God for Eternity
Utter incontinence is not an obligation
Love, and the suffering it causes reveal
A long windy road to inner perfection
From passion to Holiness...
