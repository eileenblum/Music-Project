Getting to know thyself starts
When you raise your gaze to the stars

Here comes Shamas, the one who shines through his glory
Expecting to be known
He lives alone but without privacy
Sin, the Moon God
The talented but deviant lyricist
He's destined to solitary wanderings and adventurous life

I see Nergal, the epitome of zeal and violence
Meant to strike the right balance between action and wildness
Istar is graceful and irresistible
A boundless dedication doomed to fall into madness

And there is Nebo... the conscientious one
Skillful... and clearly heartless, save for his own ends
A forgotten genius whose cleverness turned into lies
He, the nimble one, who has thrown too many stones
Thus having revenge by enslaving the weak minds
At last a dead star charred by the light of glory

Thus we shall define our celestial nature
Through the seven stars dwells our vocation... our labor...

Adar, the order's creator
He's pure and nominated for great works of faith and science
Merodack, the jovial, the one whose name you stole
He gets power only by the consent of his peers
The consent of the temple

You are Nebo... the unsightly one
Skillful... and clearly heartless, save for your own ends
The forgotten genius whose cleverness turned into lies
You, the nimble one, who has thrown too many stones
Thus having revenge by enslaving the weak minds
At last a dead star charred by the light of glory

Thus we shall define our celestial nature
