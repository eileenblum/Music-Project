After religion and lordship, art was yet to be destroyed
We lost the standards but I found them again

I do believe in the ideal, in tradition, in a noble power structure
Our task is to discard all three abominations
That lead us to the doctrine of decay

I predict a miracle! A rose will rise and open growing
I predict a miracle! Here will triumph the mystic triad of Artistry

Art is the great mystery
When effort leads to a masterpiece
Divine rays descend... like on the altar
Art is the real empire
When the human hand draws a perfect line
Angels descend... to mirror themselves
Art is the great miracle
This is the evidence of our timelessness
Art-God, the last reflection from heaven of our downfall

I predict a miracle! A rose will rise and open growing
I predict a miracle! Here will triumph the mystic triad of Artistry

After belief and discipline, creation was yet to be wasted
We lost the standards but I found them again

Those dark times made us forget that art is invested with a holy mission
It shall create the path to redemption for the salvation of mankind
The Great Revelation
The gallery is the New Church
Weak conferences are preached
Works are the mirrors of light
And the watchers are disciples

I predict a miracle! A rose will rise and open growing
I predict a miracle! Embracing the divine cross of salvation
I predict a miracle! Here will triumph the mystic triad of Artistry
