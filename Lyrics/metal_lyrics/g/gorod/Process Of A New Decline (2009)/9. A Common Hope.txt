Participating in my city's life is the point of my enrichment
Every day you make, seal my devotion morestrongly
Taking the tools of reconstruction is binding me to my fellows
Everything I do signs further my worship for you Adam
I wake up every morning claiming our salvation
The one you handed down to us
I kneel down every night to celebrate your coming
The one which has freed us
My name is Gorith, mainstay of the city, I drill the ground
My hands are working to extend life's lanes
I don't see the light, frozen are my eyes and blind is my mind
There's no place for tiredness when I must hear Adam's voice

Expiate our misdeeds
Mortify the past
A new day is coming
And it is to better serve us that you are arising at last

My name is Silva, messenger of the city, I transfer orders
My voice rises to enforce community's rules
I can't sleep anymore, my thoughts are divided, I' near madness
And it's to fight my wandering, that I keep moving

Expiate our misdeeds
Mortify the past
A new day is coming
And it is to better serve us that you are arising at last

Every day I wake up to scream my hunger
The one that stabs deep inside me
I kneel down every night to praise the feast
The one that feeds our souls

Expiate our troubles
Mortify the past
A new day is coming
And it is to better serve us that you are arising at last
