Let me rest in peace
I'm nothing, I can't teach anyone a lesson anymore
My cells want to stay inert
Why do you keep approaching me
My neurons are so old
I won't be men's clown anymore
My nerves have became numb
I don't dictate laws, I am the law

Stay united instead. Are we there to regulate men's deviancies?
I can't believe in this meaningless cause leading to no salvation
Watch our laws stirring up again a taste for life and desire
I can't imagine our lines are drowning our kindred
My target isn't mankind. Evils are deeper. Fight obsequium minaris
The spark of hope that stays in me will blow up the whole system
The game we're in is simple: men's exploitation
One feeling is driving me: vengeance!!

Stay united instead. Are we there to regulate men's deviancies?
I can't believe in this meaningless cause leading to no salvation
Watch our laws stirring up again a taste for life and desire
I can't imagine our lines are drowning our kindred

I'm Adam, the non-human eraser
I'm re-establishing money game and sex
And creating anarchy in my Edaenia
I'm Adam the purifier of humans
I break the chains of those who want to fight
And give their lives for liberty
Everyone will have to kill a minarian and anyone running off!
Everyone will write their own story through the others
Blood will squirt again
Guts will be your fetishes
Bones will break, bones will smash in slimy marrowshed
Your bulging eyes, your scarification, will flow in with hate

Stay united instead. Are we there to regulate men's deviancies?
I can't believe in this meaningless cause leading to no salvation
Watch our laws stirring up again a taste for life and desire
I can't imagine our lines are drowning our kindred

Your skin, dry and rough as leather, I burn it!
