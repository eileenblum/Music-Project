First these were the eight rings of tears
Pride, negligence, desire, rage, laziness, temptation, cupidity, lust
Every soul racked by chaos was filled with penitence
We are the mere shadows of our former selves no more

Let life take its rights again
Let the monarchy be annihilated
Be united against those who are lying to you

Man regain his consciousness
No more unremitting work
No more futile prayers
No more regulator

Let life take its rights again
Let the monarchy be annihilated
Be united against those who are lying to you

Let life take its rights again
Let the monarchy be annihilated
Be united against those who are exploiting you: OM

Man facing himself, regaining consciousness
Waking up again

Lies. Dispersal. Doctrines.
Have passed their time
Feel. React. Order. Kill.
Primitive you are. Primitive you'll stay

Accomplish your destiny again
And kill if you want to survive

Lies. Dispersal. Doctrines.
Have passed their time
Feel. React. Order. Kill.
Primitive you are. Primitive you'll stay

I can see them already, eviscerated in bulk
Facing those they used to bow low before

Let life take its rights again
Let the monarchy be annihilated
Be united against those who are oppressing you: OM

My brain is bubbling again with the blood
That flows from our divine masters
Man's rage will be as powerful
As the cult they were possessed by
Barbary. Savagery. Massacre...
Do you see, father, what I have become
First these were the eight rings of tears
Then came chaos
You were god but now you are a shaky king
Yet attractive your court ruled on us
Are we the fools pulling faces to entertain you

Let life take its rights again
Let the monarchy be annihilated
Be united against those who are deceiving you: OM

Man facing himself, regaining consciousness
Waking up again

Lies. Dispersal. Doctrines.
Have passed their time
Feel. React. Order. Kill.
Primitive you are. Primitive you'll stay

Instinctive you are, instinctive you'll stay
