We are legions
Hidden through the ages

Secret among secret, embedded in masses, we're acting
Manipulating, killing by necessity, we're protecting

Soracle's prophecy
Adam and Edaenia
The next humanity
Your future

From the first men
From the earliest civilizations

With the passing time, we've adapted ourselves
To depend on no one, here's our principle
Technology, economy, politics, ecology
Dominate all domains, here is our strength

Obsequium Minaris
Soracle's legions
Chosen among the chosen
Guardians of the prophecy
Obsequium Minaris
Soracle's legions
Chosen among the chosen
Guarantor of Edaenia

We've fought barbarians, warriors, zealots
Whatever the means, Adam has been protected
We've defeated peoples, kingdoms, religions
Whatever the means, the cave has remained a secret

Overpopulation, misery
Disfigured environment
