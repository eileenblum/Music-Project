Will you recognize the nature of your roots?
Will you find, in the engraved burning stone your personal search?
Imagine a profitable prophecy announced monolith of Man's rebirth
Hear the Messiah's name, as the path to our cult

Disown, renounce your mortal life
Believe in your father's written works

Will you recognize, the brothers who are yours?
Will you find, the mangled blood true nature of your existence?
Brave the rules, the ones that generated your birth
Give the rest of your lifetime, so you'll defend Man's quest for humanity

Could you endure, ordeals established by your peers?
Will you follow, in the blood written works, your vocation thus revealed?

Realize your part of the prophecy
Inherent tribute to human race's survival
Ensure your lineage
As the key to access to your cast

Could you fully assume, the role confided to you?
Will you follow, the instructions for bringing into play of the project?
Let it be engraved in your flesh, the sign of Obsequium Minaris legions
Perpatuate your inherited works, then you'll become eternity's prophet

Disown, renounce your mortal life
And see the saviour
Believe in your father's written works
Give birth to Adam
