I'm a newborn granted the opportunity to live
Future representative of my race, I have been chosen
I've seen many others that have been ripped apart
Is it a crime to regulate one's own for the rest to survive?

I'm an old man granted the right to rot
First guinea pig of my race, I have been chosen
I've seen many others that have been deconnected
Is it a crime to regulate one's own for the rest to survive?

I'm a mother granted the opportunity to give birth
Scientists' ultimate creator, I've been impregnated
I've seen abnormal females that have been suffocated
Isn't it right for healthy surrogate mothers to live on?

Be the foundation stone
Assert your creators' survival
Be the foundation stone
Assert your creators' survival

Tell me what use you are to know if you will survive
Give me your abilities and I'll keep you alive
If not die

I'm a poor man granted the opportunity to work
As a new thinker among my brothers, I've been recognized
I've seen unsuccessful men whose lives were terminated
Isn't it justice that the best amongst us win?

I'm a model granted a chance to be cloned
My fathers' ancient prototype, I have been made
Dismantled 'cause of my obsolete structure, I've declined
Why can't development pioneers be a part of the death-dealing elite?
