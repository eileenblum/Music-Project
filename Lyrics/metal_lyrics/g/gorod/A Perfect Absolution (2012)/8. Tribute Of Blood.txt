We can wait for years outside
Great will be our pleasure to hear you beg
We know it won't be long before you to run out of resources
Soon you will not have enough to survive
You'll become only dead branches
And I'll burn all traces of your existence

We are the wolves among the herd
We'll take out the whole flock one by one
If you do not kill us now, we will destroy you all
So get out of your cage and pay what we demand

Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood

I can't content myself with honey, wax and furs
But your muddy blood that will nourish the roots
Of the World Tree you have betrayed

We are the wolves among the herd
We'll take out the whole flock one by one
If you do not kill us now, we will destroy you all
So get out of your cage and pay what we demand

Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood

Mindless fools ! Will you abandon madness for reason ?
Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood
This fortress will become your tomb
Troops are hidden in the deep dark of night
We'll crush the last hope of your kind

We are wolves among the herd
We'll take out the whole flock one by one
If you do not kill us now, we will destroy you all So get out of your cage and pay what we demand

Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood
