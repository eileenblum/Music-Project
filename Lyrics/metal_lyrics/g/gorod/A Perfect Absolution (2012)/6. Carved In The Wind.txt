The wild ones must be slain
Vengeance fulfilled by the wrath of the Great One
O Perun ! Utter the ancient words of power
Allow me to cast a merciless doom upon them
O Perun ! May we strike them harder than stone

Let's remember...
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us
And none but the gods have decided
Varangians always had control of the River
It's time to prove it. It's time to prove it now

If they feel at one with the earth
I promise they will soon be as one
Their lungs will be filled with mud and worms
They will drown in their own blood Their bones will be consumed by flames
And their suffering will be engraved in the air

Let's remember...
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us
And none but the gods have decided
Varangians always had control of the river
It's time to prove it. It's time to prove it. Now !

We will erect a memorial to the glory of the King Sculptured by suffering and tormented cries
A divine masterpiece made with our own hands
That will be etched in the winds forever

I swear he will soon join you. My pain carried by the wind.
I swear I will avenge you. He so wants to take your place... I'm afraid he has no fear
But I've sworn I will go through with my duty

The cries of pain shall echo in the air to be carved in the wind
This is how we will accomplish this terrifying work Let Stribog spread the chant of agony

Let's remember...
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us
And none but the gods have decided
Let Stribog spread the chant of their agony
And carve their suffering in the wind
