When the best men of Dereva arrive
They will be welcomed with open arms
Here they will find the food the women and the wine

Soak the shoots of birch
Heat the water scorching hot
Fill the room with steam
Until they can barely see each other

We'll send for the most graceful women of all the land
To serve and pleasure you
We'll do everything to make our guests feel at ease

Soak the shoots of birch
Heat the water scorching hot
Fill the room with steam
Until you can barely see each other

Only the most illustrious men are welcome
Then we may go to your prince with great honor
So, make your first steps into heaven on earth Here life is only pleasure and delight...
Give way to your most unholy desires

Burn ! Ill-famed traitors ! Now suffer my wrath !

Soon the burning breath of vengeance will escape from your bodies
You shall taste our Varangian Paradise
After you all have bathed, you shall come to me

Steam so thick you can't see anymore
Scorching heat becomes the air you breathe
Sighs are filled with suffocating smoke
Thrash, kick and lick your bodies with burning tongues

The love juice running down
Your thighs burning and boiling
