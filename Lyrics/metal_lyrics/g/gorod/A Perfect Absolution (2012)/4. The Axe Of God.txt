They have learnt to fight in the forest and live in harmony with nature
They have knowledge of a territory that is hostile to us

I know there is nothing they can fear
But the anger of the Queen
The Axe of God The Axe of their own God

We can't let them have an opportunity to control the entire river
But it would certainly be the best way to bring them down

Tonight, the Axe will collect a bloody harvest of heads
Let the Almighty Perun lend me strength and bravery
And let the gruesome scene of your impaled bodies along the ways
Reveal to the world the price of such a crime

Let the Almighty Perun lend me strength and bravery
I swear the eternal oath ! I am now the arm of God
The Axe of God

You will ever regret your felony
When my soldiers rape your wives
And when I make your children be my slaves until they die

This is the first tribe that refused to submit to the king's command
They must be the only ones who chose to fight against our will

Now they no longer believe in knowing the slightest fear
It's time to for them to pay
Befall on their heads the wrath of gods

I know there is nothing they can fear
But the Axe of their own God
Vengeance is ours
Now, vengeance is mine
