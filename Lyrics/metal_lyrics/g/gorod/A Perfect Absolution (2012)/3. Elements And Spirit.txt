These statues are no gods !
Just useless objects carved of wood Now they may exist but soon they will be reduced to nothing Left to rot away, erased by time, their ashes swept away by the wind

These soulless gods you worship are neither sacred nor human
We only built them with our own hands
But what good have these gods done ?

A single element can sink them into oblivion What good have done those gods ?
We only built them with our own hands I don't want to give my soul to demons...

I will lay the foundation stone for the sacred new empire And God shall be the witness
I'll carry out my flawless plan
Tomorrow everything will change
You'll bow down to me
There is only one God !
Gods who let the kings die don't deserve to be honored If the regent converts or give up the kingdom The cult figures shall burn. They will become meaningless

Perun alone is worthy to bear the name of God `
But as he is a vengeful spirit, he can't wash me of my sins

I must harness the elements to take my revenge
Let fire burn them, water drown them, earth bury them
And let their cries for mercy be carried on the wind... only then will I find peace...
Faith will bring us a new way of life, the road to redemption

When my time comes, I will rejoice in eternal rest Looking down upon my work from heaven, I will laugh at the chaos I created I will avenge the King !
Impure blood shall drench the earth
My new road leads south

I will not look behind me
Moving from hell towards the light, their God is my God I will lay the foundation stone for the sacred new empire And God shall be the witness
I'll carry out my flawless plan Tomorrow everything will change
You'll bow down to me
