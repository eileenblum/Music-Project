[spoken:]
in lands prisitine you'll find that which possesses the weak of mind

throughout 
our feeble domain
the human transgretions 
of waste and decay

the stains of blood
have marked our way
ambitions surpassed 
by ever greater "deeds"

inside of every man's heart 
could lie the seeds of temperance 

instead,
the mongers amass
in endless procession
with steel and seal

it calls!
ingrained in our creed
disease of possession
regression through need

in lands prisitine you'll find that which possesses the weak of mind
with gaze and glare and lured within, one blinding faith they follow
the dreams of unposessed repressing ancient values

and when hearts fail, forgotten of need
throw down the shackles - humanity's greed!
seek out the essence that's left to us pure
abandon on claims, surrender land's lure
