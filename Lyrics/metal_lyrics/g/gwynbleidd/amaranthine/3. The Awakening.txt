Awake!
To ancient ways,
where truth prevails!

[spoken voices, shimmer]

search within yourself

borne of current age of desacration
a realm of men exists against the natural ways

archaic truths
come tonight 
absolve us of fabled axioms

from now on
let there rule the light of old
let runes burn 
among the men who never knew
the value of blood

show thyself
dressed in sins of old

in these words I see the way
to reach for wisdom of the ages 
through these words i walk the paths
those our forefathers hailed
