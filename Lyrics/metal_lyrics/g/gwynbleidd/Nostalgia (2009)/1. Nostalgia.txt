As in a dream I traveled back
to times lost, places remembered
And with me I took all that is I
And once there, I held still in the moment
aware that again it would be gone
Gone were the days - echoes in memory
sweet exallings of my mindless flaw
lived onâ¦

Together we ran away
abandoned reason for hope
And left behind our essence
Lost it all, and for what

Alas, on wings of hope
were we to meet at the end of roads
To what the facade
dressed in strokes of mocking void
left me dreaming for

To past comes alive and clear with awareness
Trees bare green around the senile court
Awaken to the kind of dandelion youth
others have only dreamt about

To hold is still
The countless times I've searched and failed
for what - you cannot see
Seductive cult of yearning
blindly leads me still - away

Blessed with the notion of past no more
we blundered on without cause
The mist once ever fallen - forever
exiled the most cherished thoughts
