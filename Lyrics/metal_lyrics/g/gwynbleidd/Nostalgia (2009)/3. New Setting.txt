With solemn gaze towards the far
gathering remnants of vibrant unease
The sun inert, behind a sullen fog
and still towards eastern shore
The time begone became my northern star
like so many times before

Into primeval
With disquiet at hand
the sole word laden by avowal
And this eve's contrariety manifests

There alive by midnight wild
the weary guard watches
Gathering around
as winds dance upon the nest again

See me in the summer night
among the ones who knew my tale.
know me still
For I am returned to where I've dwelled

There upon the summit of hope
where tracks blend with echoes of the pastâ¦
The blooming flora I've come to cherish
extends its fearful hand

How weak my voice among the winds of time
How small my stance, against colossal trends
How feeble my hope in the hands of the maker
and, how misguided my reason to beg for this
- A new setting

â¦and there at he solstice of this animation
to disperse back into the voidâ¦
