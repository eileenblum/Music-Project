Having first entered the void
I turned to night's blooming fields
All shining in violet, reddish livid
Assumptions were of nothing less
than spring's courtly welcome
Begging my will to stay

Left alone I tried a path
destined to fail from the very outset
Cast aside, barred from joining
in your glorious essence

One by one the droplets fell
from the heavy sky
Touches of a calming cold
against a fevered skin

I found more worry than peace
in the light of this

On the ridge of sight
to whence I've run, defying given fate
Untouched by passing time
storm of earth - I call your name

Having first entered the void
I turned to night's blooming fields
Among them my own steps I found
- fading sea of leavesâ¦
