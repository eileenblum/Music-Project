â¦stain the canvas blackâ¦

And so my endless dreams contrived
marked by peering face of childhood years
forever scaling turn of downward steps

For still unknowingly
from this guest I've laid
upon my faith and pride
the long forgotten dread I won

And ever since that moment
and every night
in shapeless helpless mist I've drowned
seeking foreverâ¦
