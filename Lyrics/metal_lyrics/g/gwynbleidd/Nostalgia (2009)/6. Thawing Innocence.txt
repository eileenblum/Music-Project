Cast my whispers into windâ¦
Let them fall wherever words
find receptive soil

Cast my thoughts of winters gone
together with their fading memory
May they rest in cold silence
under blanket of white snow

â¦until it's time to wake
and cast my whispers into wind

Set my dreams among the living spring
scent of pine and wings towards the call
Torn a thousand, forceful, feverish ways

Cast my whispers into windâ¦
Let them fall wherever words
find receptive soil
Torn a thousand feverish ways

And once the day of end arrives
drown my urge in soil's warmth

â¦

Take me back, hold my arm
in the summer of life
When the breeze reached for our faces
and I could bear your heart
