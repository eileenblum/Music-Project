[Music - GÃ³ngora, Lyrics - Duque]

Epidermic sounds all of them spit
To my desperate torrent
To my livin' chalise
Without allowing silence
To scape from my voice
Or the pain inside
And close my eyes and listen to your whispers
And close my eyes and listen to your whispers
Sayin'... don't believe what you feel
When the pain speaks
Don't believe what you see
When your eyes are blood
Just give me your live, give me your mind
Give me your heart, and forever fly
Forever fly......
Forever fly......
Now that you're not light
Oh! Beautiful Desdemona
Come kiss my lips, come drink my blood
Now that you're not flesh
Come, drink my blood, come, kiss my lips
Oh! Beautiful Desdemona
