[Music - Erebor / Palacio, Lyrics - Erebor / Duque]

She's got my soul catch in her darkest wings
She know my sadness and she rules my mind
I can't remember but I'm breakin' down
I'd lost control of my own empty life
She's like a butterfly
She's got my soul catch in her darkest wings
She know my sadness and she rules my mind
I can't remember but I'm breakin' down
I'd lost control of my own empty life
Con su suave vuelo, eleva mis sueÃ±os
Sus colores me hipnotizan y me drogan
She's like a butterfly
