[MÃºsica: Juan D. Palacio, Miguel G., Letra: Juan D. Duque]

I start to look
Inside my soul exists
To those eyes
Of lightness
It makes me set aside
Heaven from hell
And I get decipher
My mental labyrinth
I sink
In this vast
Ocean of wisdom
And in itâs waters,
My body quiet instinct
I blow in the mental
Shining spirals
And in its colors,
My mind soothe crime
Infinite light of redemption
Calm my thirst again
Infinite light of redemption
It feeds me with sweet dreams
I start to look
Inside my soul exists
To those eyes
Of lightness
It lets me choose
Angel or demon?
And I get decipher
My mental labyrinth
My corrupt blood was spilled and consumed too
In painful paths of purity
In painful paths of purity
Infinite light of redemption, Calm my thirst again
Infinite light of redemption, Calm my tears away
Infinite light of redemption, Calm my thirst again
Infinite light of redemption, Calm my tears away
