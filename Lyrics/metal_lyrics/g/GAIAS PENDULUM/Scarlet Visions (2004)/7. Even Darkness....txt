[MÃºsica: Miguel G. Hernan Y., Letra: Hernan Y.]

Even darkness takes my heart
My blasphemy
This time has to take other chance
To get outside
I have to find my way (living outside)
To stop this world(of lies)
Screaming to this land inside (and stay in there)
Open your eyes

[Chorus:]
Forgive your god...
Even my bones are made of stone
I can defend
My fields full of my disgrace
Sired in my face
Even darkness takes my heart
My blasphemy
This time has take other chance
Open your eyes

[Chorus]

I have to find my way
To stop this world
Screaming to this land inside
Open your eyes
