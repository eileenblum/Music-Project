[MÃºsica y letra: Adrian Diaz]

To have the rain in hands
To stay at the end
How could I clean my soul
How could I break this wall
Fighting, this pain can win
Surrendering is worst
I am a devil and god at time
Iâm a crime leaving this word
No rest of my tears
To live in death, to die in life

[Chorus:]
Days of nights, time without space
Lies of truth, cold fires in hell
Forever never, forever the end
Believing in nothing, full of emptiness

[Chorus 2:]
Blessing my sins, finding that lost
Drinking my thirst, waking in dreams
Forever never, forever the end
Believing in nothing, full of emptiness
