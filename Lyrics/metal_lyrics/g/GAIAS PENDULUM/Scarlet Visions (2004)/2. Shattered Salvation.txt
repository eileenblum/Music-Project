[MÃºsica: Miguel G. Adrian D., Letra: Juan D. Duque]

To see how my dark soul
Searches hopelessly
The sun shine
Feeling how you claw your name
With bloody letters on my heart
You dragged my dying body
You tore my wings
With a whisper
Now, I deny my own salvation
The burning feeling of evil
Seems to preach
To my conscience
How to sin
To fall in the total silence

Now you have my shattered
Existence
And forever scattered
You forced me to deny my holy redemption
Will you take my last innocent though?
Where I can see my self
Where I can hear to my self
Where my face fades in blood
That my eyes cries
Itâs impossible to live like this
Swimming in the silence,
Choked in the scorn
That creates your sorrow
