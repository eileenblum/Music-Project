[MÃºsica: Miguel G. Adrian D. Hernan Y., Letra: Miguel G.]

Feeling emotions
Deep in my heart
An ecstasy of love
Running thru me

[Chorus:]
Iâm falling in anger
My tears are falling down- Away
All screams are fading out â Away
My life is lost and found
Last breath before I die
Ecstasy is filling me
Itâs a beauty shine
In the middle
Of a darkest night

[Chorus 2:]
My tears are falling down-Away
All screams are fading out â Away
My life is lost and found
Last breath before I die
Life of my life
Blood of my blood
I feel you like the wind in the dawn
