[MÃºsica: Adrian D. Miguel G., Letra: Adrian D.]

I heard your voice in shadows
Too blind, too lost
Too hidden to find you
Please take my blood
Come inside of me
This time Iâll be your slave
Drink all what you get
Drink all what Iâm
The death should be my calm
Donât you think?
Just stop it when is done
Just stop it when Iâm gone
The pleasure of your bit
Your silent breath
A death song I can hear
The sounds of my screams
Just stop it when Iâm gone. [x3]
Just stop it I am gone...
She carried me through the night by her heaven
She left me down
She stopped my breath, she closed my eyes
She smiled, she smiled, she smiled
Now we fly in the forest of the lights
To die to die to die
