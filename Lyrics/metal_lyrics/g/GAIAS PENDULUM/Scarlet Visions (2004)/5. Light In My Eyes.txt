[MÃºsica y letra: Miguel G.]

Feel your dead heart
Your eyes crying blood
See scarlet visions
From the pain inside
Your life is full of loneliness
Your heart is full of hate
Angry consume your soul
Let your hammer fall
How can I see your face?
How can I feel your blood?
Vengeance...
Itâs my only thought
Die by my hand
By my soul
By my hate
Now can I fly free?
Now can I live this?
The past only live
Beyond my mind
Walking away
In the night, in the dark.
Death... in your life
Blood... in my hands
Light... in my eyes
