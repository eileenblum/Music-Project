I'm nothing it's true alone and quiet with despairs
Call me secretly, am I dead in these pains?
These moments are nothing... build a truth
Research me in silence and reflect these lies
Burn the candles for last thoughts of mind
Call me secretly, am I there... with pains?
Find the last lights of obscurity when I a the beauties of gloom
Burn the candles for the last night
