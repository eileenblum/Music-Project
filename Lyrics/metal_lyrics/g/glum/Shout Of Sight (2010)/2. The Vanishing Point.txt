Gloomy trace dark embrace, broken mind of grace
Mortal rays in days from darkest praise
Restless pains from base, no tears and despairs
Don't denial these lies when I read in your eyes
Control your everything, don't feel your nothing
I'm here still... just for heal
Digression from air to the spaces of fair
Paranormal insanity for final amiability

I don't want my groan, I don't want my life
I don't want my tears, I don't want these cries
I don't need to light, I don't need to sight
I don't need my heart, I don't need these lies
