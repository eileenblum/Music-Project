Somewhere into the gloom... imprisoned in tears
Innocent thoughts from nihility and portraits over the place
Staring to the gleamy moon, unrelated lines on the walls
Like bloody blade when it's walking on the skin
It seems be true... when nigritude is growing deep
Despairing words and thoughts... infected my all
Where I'm saying these pains... when I'm saying my pains?
Reminiscent of silence and horizontal nothingness
Remember sentences for digress, remind me suggestions
She's sleeping groaningly and I'm still tearing for myself
These dire desolations of time with blind eyes abhided in lies
For what no one can hear me, For what no one can hear me?
