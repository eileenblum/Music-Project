"I put the speeches in the blackness and vanity... can you name it
Life, when I've drowned in chaos?
Unhand me again... I'm introspect anyway... I killed my soul in my desolateness"

I may thank myself, not from me
Look at this misunderstanding and kill me again
I'm against the life and existence
Fade me slowly in this slowness

I've desire to cut my flesh,
You killed my wishes, desires
Fade me slowly in this slowness,
And look at this misunderstanding

Unhand me againâ¦
Hey you there!!!
