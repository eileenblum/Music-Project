For disillusion I'm ready and I'm talking with reasons, I've heard it of old
Can you hear me now? I don't think so... I donât care a snap of...
forget me (...)

Unhand me in bloody words
Disprison my all
Isolate me from material
Drown me in darkness
For all seasons... anymore
This natural psychosis
I was dying here
You have not any knowledge
Where is the wisdoms?
I can not see this dirt,
This unnatural dirt
I'm crawling still
The questions are unperfect,
When letter is burning
... this abandoned place,
Among the roots
I will write my poem,
With the bloody ink
I must dying tonight
Ignorance is here
Oblivion... moral delirium
Reminiscent... that's nothing
Devastation... the future
Preface... restless words

Psychosis, Material, Oblivion, Ignorance
