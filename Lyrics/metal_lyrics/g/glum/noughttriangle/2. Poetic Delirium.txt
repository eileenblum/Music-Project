Hey Narvin!
Can you tell me of solitude... and it griefs and tears?
Hey Narvin!
Can you play my song and poem in your loneliness?
Hey Narvin!
Can you feel me in far from true with lies?
Hey Narvin!
Can you help me by sing a poem of love?
Hey Narvin!
Can you send me in an earth free from worms?
Hey Narvin!
Can you read my so sad histories?
Hey Narvin!
Can you blind me so I can't see this world?
Hey Narvin!
Can you prove me that you have a heart in yor body?
Hey Narvin!
Can you leave me in death, life, love?
Hey Narvin!
Can you show me a nature with no limitation?
Hey Narvin!
Can you feel the erosion of a whiteness?
Hey Narvin!
Can you tolerate this void like me?

No you can't
Because everything is changing in this room so quick
Because dreams are so high flying.
Because purporsts are so deep and words are vain
Because we have no a sence in our existence
But we can't find our true... never
Because we drowned in gloom
All the things are dead in here
All the words are lying

And I'm still flying...
Flying in nowhere... with no one
