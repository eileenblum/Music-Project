This blackness is so deep
And my heart is sick

For gloom I am dead
And for you I am a homo

There is nothing and glum for you
There is a birth for years of you

Screams are so deep and bitter
The dreamers sleeping so deep

I'm fear of your smash
I'm dead with your crash

And now tell me why you?
Why you're sleeping with my mash?

Your smile is so ridiculous
More ridiculous than another ridiculouses

I am Bardan! an instrument for you
Please play me on your exist

Spring and winter are dead
These seasons are just a dream

A voiceless mortality of advices
With no reason... with nothing

I am not a wine of love
I am sick and mute in this time

You must ignore my words from your mind
Because I am nothing to your life

End...

[Lyrics: Bardan in May 2009 / Music: Bardan in spring 2009]
