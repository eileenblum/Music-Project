far from nature and far from depression
I found a meaningless, voiceless destruction
but no one still can feel me in this void
cause I am still crying deep in this void.
and still Iʹm trying for salvation
but they all are dead with my poetic reason
and now I have to say something by my words
please hear my voice and countless lying discords.
when I drowned in darkness and itʹs purporsts
I got wrong cause I have no wish to breathe
in this time and this place no one can see me
perceptions and obsolescence in subversions.
in last days of my suicide Iʹm afraid of...
cause Iʹm living in other side of my life
and now I canʹt do this to you my vision
when I canʹt see my lover in that reason.
so tearing for myself in other side
cause destruction has been scratched in the essence
and gloom is derived beyond everything...
in the destruction , living with sight I am.
and so everything flourished in spring and winter
this prize is no more for your gracious season...
painting with grief my portrait of the sadden life
I rend my lips my hand and my blackest pod.
you need to my blood for your life constructions
you need to my perfection and perfect exhaustion.
you need to my loneliness and my broken heart.
you need to my needless love my latest part.
I rend my lips, staying with grief, knowing sheʹs dead, feeling my pains.
I curse my fate, learning my way, I lost my life, Iʹm triste.
I find intellectually, afraid of life, portraits of death, delirium.
scream... ravens, construction of death, my erosion... Iʹm gloom, Ohhh... .
Yeah... here is no one in my darkest loneliness.
