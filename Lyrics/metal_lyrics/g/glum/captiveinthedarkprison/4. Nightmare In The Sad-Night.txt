The nightmare is invading me all the night
I'm half-dead and I'm searching for a non cage land
I'm interest to a free breathing far from jail and suffering
I'm singing for the peoples (Candle) who prize me
And singing for the peoples (Gloom) who realize the light through the darkness

[Lyrics: Bardan in Summer 2007 / Music: Bardan in Autumn 2008)]
