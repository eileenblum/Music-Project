Think of my eyes and foget eternally me
Tell me of night..., leaving me in vanity!
Sick me with your pains, and kill me with true.
Do you solve my questions?
Do you speak to me in this vanity?
I think not
Because no one understand my words
Because no one feel me in this vanity
And I just can go from this place...
Where?... in the nought

[Lyrics: Bardan in August 2008 / Music: Bardan in summer 2008)]
