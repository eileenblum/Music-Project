The winter is coming...
But I am still tired
All the trees are white here
But still the black I am with torments
The night have a light in the sky
But I have no any gleaming candle
The black-shine here...
Joint in the black night
I going to dream from
To the endless dream

[Lyrics: Bardan August 2008 / Music: Bardan in summer 2008)]
