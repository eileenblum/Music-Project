Ages idol of dusk
Lord of the dark forest
Your creation of the darkness
And dark minds exile from sky

Looking for black eyes
From aged mystic age
I see dark shadow
From aged mystic age

Funeral celebration
Sacrament of black circle
Come back time of dark gods

Your mysterious way to our minds
Holy bonfire consecrate your coming
In flesh of the light
I feel your presence
In dark hiding of my soul
I hear your words

Aged idol of dusk...
