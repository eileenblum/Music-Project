Black clouds in heaven
Ravens fly to the valley of rites,
Chernobog has to be invoked
To color in black your life
Paganpriest make the rite
Rite of blackgods, rite of pagan
Blood flows through heaven with rain
Chernobog flies on wings of the black bird,
Black sorcery starts to begin
Ancient memory rising in us
To kill the Jehova &amp; Jesus
Dusted tombs are opened,
Ancient deads walk to the Div,
And the Christ we killed,
And the blood flows from wind
Mourning screams of Christ
Ran over valley,
Div killed them, and the soul of pagan wake up
Fate of Christ is killed
And we fly with Div in the sky...
