My body is taken by the cells inside
They'll consume me, hollow,
Turn me dry
I've got no way to fight this on my own
Whatever ails me fades a stable soul
Turn up the lights, sear it away
Now it's unending; fills the body wide
How long 'til this common life will fold
Turn up the lights, sear it away
It's what you can't know
I won't come back alive
Both eyes retire
All bones are dark
Down to dust
