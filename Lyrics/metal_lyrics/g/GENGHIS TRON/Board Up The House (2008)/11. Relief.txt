I see no light ahead
I choke on desperate breath
We knew the water's rise
Felt the ground subside.
I loved who I could
As war clouded minds
I did what was right
As we all came loose
I see no light ahead
And I feel your panic too
I hear the battered soil sigh
If we're broke
It's the right time
All will be forgotten
All will be well
