In the belly of these dreadful days
What's there to believe
I plead: "what can I do"
Don't look ahead
It's all desperate ends
But I do, I do
Love will haunt all life,
In time, the world's undone.
In time, one death will bind.
Right now each mess we're in
Puts us in fate's harsh old hands
In the shadow of those looming days
What's there to believe
I plead: "What will I do, what then?"
You'll come to fear
Each day
Each night
You'll come to fear
Each day
Each night
