At twilight the day sheds its skin letting our starved hands in
By sun-up the night's fully dressed giving our tired hands rest
At twilight the day sheds its skin
Don't lay down
Sheets rise
You sleep like the end is night
You sleep like the bed's on fire
Hands in the night
Cut through the thickest hours
At twilight the day sheds its skin letting our starved hands in
By sun-up the night's fully dressed giving our tired hands rest
