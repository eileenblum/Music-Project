My mind can't shake one sound
It lodged and grew...
I'm breaking down
It's all around
The bed's thin sound
It's all around
Air rings through (and through) stagnant rooms
Pinching, prodding me
Great insidious sound! leave me! leave me be!
Lately you've found I break between white walls that burn the nerves
No noise can shake me but I feel me breaking
Turning back
It's all around
It all breaks down
