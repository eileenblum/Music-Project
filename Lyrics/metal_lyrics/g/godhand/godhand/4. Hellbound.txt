I've always had this sinking feeling that
I am not where I belong.
Constantly distracted by my need to be free of the insanity that keeps pushing me to move on.
Be free of the shit that has always surrounded me.
Get me out of this fucking insanity.
They say home is where the heart is, but mine's filled with fucking darkness.
Entombed within the filth that I've created.
Craving escape from a life full of hatred.
I've gotta get the hell out of here.
This place is so goddamn draining.
My breaking point is near.
Falling apart from the inside out.
Why does nobody know what the fuck I'm talking about?
This filthy house was never a fucking home.
I'd rather spend my life on the road and die alone.
I'm fucking gone.
I'm leaving this town, and I have no idea if I'll ever be back around.
Goddamn fucking Hellbound.
I'm overtaken.
I'm fucking gone.
I'm leaving this town, and I have no idea if I'll ever be back around.
This might be the last time that you see my face, so just remember that
I'm finally free now that I've left this place.
