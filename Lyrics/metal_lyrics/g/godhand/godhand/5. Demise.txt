This planet is doomed to die.
We're all gonna fucking die.
None of us are going to make it out alive.
Why the fuck do you even try?
Why do we even try?
No matter what you do you're still wasting time.
Wasting fucking time.
The clock is counting down to our untimely demise.
Oh to our demise.
This world is coming to an end.
A self-fulfilling prophecy.
We're all drowning in hypocrisy.
Suffocating in dishonesty.
Mindless drones,
Unseen consciousness in fragile bones.
This bullshit population is over fucking populated.
Headed for global annihilation.
Overdue for extermination.
Parasitic destructive creatures bleeding the planet dry.
The universe will continue on, but this world as we know it will fucking die.
