This world that we live in has been dragging me down.
Trying to keep my head above water,
Fuck it
I quit just let me drown.
I'm sick and tired of having to try so fucking hard to keep it together.
Day after day I am further away from getting any fucking better.
Mother fucker I'm about to lose control,
I'm growing cold.
If I even had a soul it would be sold to the devil himself, but he'd give it back 'cause it's black not fucking gold.
This isn't a manic phase,
It's who I am.
A demon unleashed upon this earth, and I won't stop until you're all six feet in the dirt.
I will not stop until my life is fucking done.
I am the one to bring hell upon you all, and I will not stop until my life is fucking done.
I am the one to bring hell upon you all.
