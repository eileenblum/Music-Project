Fuck you for leaving me behind.
I wish I wouldn't have wasted so much time dealing with you and your fucked up life.
Out of my sight so get the fuck out of my mind.
Always running can never seem to hide.
Trying to release the prisoner trapped inside.
Trapped inside your vacant body.
I always knew that someday you'd go on without me.
I have been neglected.
I've been neglected, but it has shaped who I am.
The hate infected me in ways you can't understand, but I've evolved into something new.
Forced to adapt to this hell that
I'm in because of you, but now this hell has become my home.
It's better than living with you and still feeling alone.
Fuck you bitch.
Fuck you now
I'm leaving you behind, and I don't give a fuck that I wasted so much time dealing with you and your fucked up life.
Out of my sight now youâre out of my mind.
Now youâre neglected.
Work your life away trying to get ahead, but with a heart so full of negligence
I think you're better off dead.
