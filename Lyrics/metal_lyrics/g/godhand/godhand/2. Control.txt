The pressure is building.
The system is sure to collapse.
They're about to lose control, 'cause they can't control what's been detached.
We've been detached.
There's been an awakening.
It's now or never, they've run out of pages to turn.
Stop listening to what youâre being told.
Wake the fuck up the world is about to burn.
The world is about to burn.
Wake the fuck up.
Take control.
Take control of your own fucking life.
Stop eating the bullshit youâre being fed.
Open up your eyes and realize that society is about to end, and the new world order will soon begin.
Not that you can do a thing about it.
Already trapped inside a cage surrounded.
You say you'll fight to be free, but I doubt it 'cause we're already fucking surrounded.
