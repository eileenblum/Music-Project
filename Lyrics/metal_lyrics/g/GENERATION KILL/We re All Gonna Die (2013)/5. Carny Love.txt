Tipping the scales at 610,
She is 5 foot nothing and hungry again
People think I'm crazy, but I love her so
I bet you can't wait to see the next show
I stick needles through my eyelids and cock
I make grown people scream in horror and shock,
I dangle from wires with hooks through my back,
Come hit my scrotum with a baseball bat

Love, carny love, it's my home where I belong

[Solo: J Trenczer]

Our web-footed children are covered with hair,
Out in public, everyone stares

Our life gives power, power to choose
Under their hair they are covered in tattoos
You can't understand how we live these lives
A ring on that bottle and claim that shit prize
Head back to home and forget we were here
What's growing in your daughter
Is what you should fear- it's my

Love, carny love, it's my home where I belong

You can't change me! We are changelings!

[Solo: J Trenczer]

We go to town spreading our seed
Your wines and your daughters so willing to please
Perpetuate our kind is our number one plan
We pray at night for an elephant man

Babies, more babies the most hideous kind
Brother and sister they make the best ones
We're trying to make one with 2 heads and 5 legs
We can charge more and we'll all get paid
