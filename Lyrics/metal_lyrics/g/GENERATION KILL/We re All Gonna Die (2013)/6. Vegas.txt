Wow

She left her home and headed for the city of angels
Dreaming of her name in lights and all the tabloid pages
She stopped along the way for two fun nights in Vegas
One hit from that pipe, now she's got a habit

He's got slick black hair and a smile that's just a greasy
Cheap cigars, a worn-out suit, and a stable full of ladies
He's got her hooked on meth, now she's a girl who never says "Maybe"
Giving head in the back of cars, so goddamn far from Kansas

[2x]
Vegas took her soul
The desert owns her dreams

She cries at night alone to the stranger in the mirror
He took everything from her, it's all becoming clearer
Now's the time for her to put a stop to all the madness
He's a guy no one will miss, his body is burned to ashes

[2x]
Vegas took her soul
The desert owns her dreams

She stands above him in the dark
He is sleeping
The moonlight glistens off the knife in her hand
The blade so sharp,
It longs for violence
Her heart so black
It longs for blood
His blood flowing
For what he's done
Revenge for her soul
Revenge for her dreams
Revenge for her soul
Revenge for her dreams

[2x]
Vegas took her soul
The desert owns her dreams

[4x]
Vegas took her soul
The desert stole her dreams
