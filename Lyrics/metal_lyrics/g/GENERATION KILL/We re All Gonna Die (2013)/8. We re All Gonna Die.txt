I fucking hate what you stand for, I hate all your lies
Your twisted old thinking will be our demise
You ruined this country with your band of thieves
Freedom and honor is brought to its knees
You control the media, spewing hatred and fear
We'll be lucky if we live another year
Big brother is watching with total control
Don't worry about the children, they'll Never grow old

[Chorus]

There's no saving us! We're all gonna die!

Driving our future with your lies and your fear
Power and money is all you hold dear
You don't give a fuck about the common man
Just about the power that you wield in your hand
Destroying anyone who doesn't think like you
Destructive cancer in everything that you do
Mother nature once again defiled and raped
Your only course of action, "Is there any money to make?"

[Rep. Chorus]

[Solo: J. Velez]

There's no saving us!
You're killing us!
It's the end of us!
We're all gonna die!

We - Can't - Be - Saved!
We're all gonna die!
