My downward spiral of self-destruction
So hard to live in my own skin
My biggest fear is self-reflection
The mirror shows me who I am
A liar, thief, manipulator,
Always choosing the wrong path
Always making wrong decisions
I will always be the loneliest of men

[Chorus]

Self-loathing is my home
The pills they ease the pain
I'm drowning in alcohol
Opiates, my true love
The needle finds the vein
Cowardly, wanting death to call

[Solo: J. Velez]

To feel that drug is all I live for
To feel its love wash over me
My body craves, my mind, it wants more
It's always calling out to me
In every shadow and every corner
Always searching out for me
I suffer alone with my hatred
This wretched agony that is me

[Rep. Chorus]

[Solo: J. Trenczer - J. Velez]

Tomorrow I'll try to recover,
I'll reach out to my family
Just one night with my lover
"Hello death, you've come for me?"
