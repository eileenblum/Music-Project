DESPITE EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW
YOU'RE RULED BY A RUINOUS PACK OF LIES
YOU MEAN NOTHING IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS
YOU'RE NOTHING IN THIS VACUUM HOLE OF TIME

YOU ARE BORN TO SERVE
A ONE USE BATTERY
A SLAVE NEVER TO BE FREE
THIS IS ALL WE ARE
NOTHING TO BECOME
WAY PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURN

THE INSANE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LEADING THE BLIND
DOWN A PATH TO BENEFIT THEIR CAUSE
THEIR DISEASE FORCED INSIDE A STOLID MIND
"NOW PRAY TO JESUS ON THAT CROSS!"

YOU ARE BORN TO SERVE
A ONE USE BATTERY
A SLAVE NEVER TO BE FREE
THIS IS ALL WE ARE
NOTHING TO BECOME
WAY PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURN
