[Solo: J. Trenczer]

Haunted by the realization
Reliving that moment in time
Searching for some salvation
Your service, now called a crime
Your life is filled with hate
What you hate the most is you
There is nowhere to hide
When you're running from the truth

[Chorus]

Fog of war - Who's the enemy?
Death galore - No casualties
Taking no prisoners - Leaving no one alive
Fog of war - Kill everything
Death galore - No clemency
Taking no prisoners - Leaving no one alive

Nightmares feel so real
Lead claiming flesh and bone
Your mind so hard to heal
For your sins you will atone
No escape from your mind
Your demons keep coming back
For your brothers you left behind
Your fragile mind collapsed

[Rep. Chorus]
