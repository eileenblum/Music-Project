[Lyrics: Rob Dukes, music: Rob Moschetti, Jason Trenczer, Jason Velez]

Are you in fear of retribution
For all the actions of your past?
In the wake of your destruction
All the lives shattered from your wrath

Are they haunting you?
Do you fell any remorse?
With total apathy
You just stayed the course

Did you ever stop to question
All the lives that you've destroyed?
With all your lies and your corruption
A grieving mother has lost her son

Are they haunting you?
Do you fell any remorse?
With total apathy
You just stayed the course

On the battlefield left to die alone
In a place with no name
Corrupt bureaucrat down in Washington
They treat war like a game

Expendable pawn
That's your only role
They don't care about you
Hey, America
Keep taking all your pills
And never see the truth

[2x]
We will save the world
Pray to us
We are the prophets of war

Total genocide of the human race
Seems their final goal
The news fills us with filthy lies
The truth is never to be told

It's all part of their evil plan
To keep us mindless sheep
Pray to our god, he'll save your soul
Keep watching TV

[2x]
We will save the world
Pray to us
We are the prophets of war

[4x]
We will save the world
Pray to us
We are the prophets of war
