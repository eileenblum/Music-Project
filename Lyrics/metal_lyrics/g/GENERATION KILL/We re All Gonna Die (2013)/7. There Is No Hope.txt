The world lives in a matrix of lies, to expose them is treason
Corruption begins at the moment of life, disposed without reason
This time will never be the same, We're on the brink of destruction
Will man ever want to change this path to extinction

[Solo: J Trenczer]

Consume every resource there is to take, man is a virus
The rich they prey upon the weak, an unscrupulous tyrant
Christ is what hey want you to find, that contemptuous lie
Now they control your mind, the blind leading the blind

Is this all we are? Nothing more to become
We have lost our way! We are only a plague!

[Solo: J Velez]

Time for the world to pay its debt
The end certainly coming
Man will see his final death, no one surviving
Revenge for all that we have done, our liquefaction
Now only good will come from our total destruction

Is this all we are? Nothing to become
We have lost our way! We are only a plague!

Invading the host, we're a deadly disease
Destroying the air and poisoning the seas
We kill everything that we don't understand
We are a virus, a virus called man

It's all gone - There is no hope

Contagion has spread and there's no quarantine
There's no cure for man, he's a violent disease
All we have brought here is death and fear
No one will cry when we all disappear

It's all gone - There is no hope

[Solo: J. Velez - J. Trenczer - R. Moschetti]
