We stand alone, together as one
Always prepared for the fight
Standing up for the weak and the meek
Search our souls, and we fight for what's right

A fist to your face, a boot to your throat
Go against us and you're sure to fail
Hate fuels our anger, hate fuels our bond
We are the righteous in the eyes of the world

Your hate, your hate
Your hate, your hate
Your hate will be your demise
Our hate, our hate
Our hate, our hate
Our hate it keeps us alive

Ignorance and prejudice fuel who you are
You live in fear and don't understand
Break you, destroy you and all you believe
That's what's best for the common good of man

Your hate, your hate
Your hate, your hate
Your hate will be your demise
Our hate, our hate
Our hate, our hate
Our hate it keeps us alive

It keeps us alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It keeps us alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We stand alone, together as one
You spill your blood, I spill my blood

We stand alone, together as one
Always prepared for the fight
Standing up for the weak and the meek
Search our souls, and we fight for what's right

A fist to your face, a boot to your throat
Go against us and you're sure to fail
Hate fuels our anger, hate fuels our bond
We are the righteous in the eyes of the world

Your hate, your hate
Your hate, your hate
Your hate will be your demise
Our hate, our hate
Our hate, our hate
Our hate it keeps us alive

It keeps us alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It keeps us alive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We stand alone, together as one
You spill your blood, I spill my blood
