The knife slices through my vein and solace fills my head
The face in the mirror I hate so much, I wish I was dead
All the shame that's buried inside of me, my endless suffering
Humiliating loneliness dies, and no one will cry for me

Dark days are slowly killing me
Dark days are overwhelming me
Dark days are slowly killing me
Dark days are overwhelming me

As the light fades from my eyes, the pain slips away
The voices that have tortured me begin their eternal sleep
All the fears and all the doubts that have plagued my life
Alone on the cold steel table, under the coroner's knife

Dark days are slowly killing me
Dark days are overwhelming me
Dark days are slowly killing me
Dark days are overwhelming me
