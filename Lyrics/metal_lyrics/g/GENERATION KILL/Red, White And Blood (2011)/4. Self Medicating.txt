I got some feelings I can't express (you're insane)
I spilled my guts this time I confess (you lied again)
There's something wrong and I have to say (you'll never learn)
Can't go on living my life this way (you're gonna burn)

So I've done wrong, I'll make it right (make it right)
Is it my fault, I've lost the fight (lost the fight)
But now I see, I realize (I realize)
Everything that's good in my life it dies (it fucking dies)

I've got some demons I can't explain (you fuckin lie)
Self medicating to numb the pain (you're gonna die)
There's something wrong and it's crystal clear (you made your bed)
Don't think I'll make it another year (you're fuckin dead)

So I've done wrong, I'll make it right (make it right)
Is it my fault, I've lost the fight (lost the fight)
But now I see, I realize (I realize)
Everything that's good in my life it dies (it fucking dies)

So I've done wrong, I'll make it right (make it right)
Is it my fault, I've lost the fight (lost the fight)
But now I see, I realize (I realize)
Everything that's good in my life it dies (it fucking dies)
