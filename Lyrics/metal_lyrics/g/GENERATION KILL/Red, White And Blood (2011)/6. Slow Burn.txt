My cock is hard as the bodies burn
Searing the flesh with the flame
I love the smell of the burning skin
And the sound of their tortured screams

I strike fear into the heart of man
Choose any death except the flame
Look down on the world with self contempt
There will be no savior from the flame

I want to watch the world burn
And laugh while I fan the flame
I want to watch the world burn
And fan the flames with gasoline

There is no rhyme, I want to watch it burn
There is no reason, no lesson learned
Melting flesh, melting bone
Bringing death to your happy home

I look like you, the perfect crime
I have my family, I'm doin time
My perfect disguise cover my tracks
Burn the world until it's black

I want to watch the world burn
And laugh while I fan the flame
I want to watch the world burn
And fan the flames with gasoline

My cock is hard as the bodies burn
Searing the flesh with the flame
I love the smell of the burning skin
And the sound of their tortured screams

I strike fear into the heart of man
Choose any death except the flame
Look down on the world with self contempt
There will be no savior from the flame
