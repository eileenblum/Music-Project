What do we do for a living ladies?
Kill - Kill - Kill
What makes the grass grow?
Blood - Blood - Blood

Gimme my bullets, gimme my gun
I'm gonna go out and kill for some fun
I kill without anger, I kill without remorse
I kill for my country and nothing more

Hatred, Hatred - That's why they want us dead
Hatred, Hatred - That's what their god has said
Hatred, Hatred - That's why they want us dead
Hatred, Hatred - That's what their fucking god has said
And we're still standing here
Fuck you, we're still standing here

Gimme my tank, gimme my plane
Killing a lot of you keeps me sane
Roadside bombings, all you got
Turn your fucking city to a parking lot

Hatred, Hatred - That's why they want us dead
Hatred, Hatred - That's what their god has said
Hatred, Hatred - That's why they want us dead
Hatred, Hatred - That's what their fucking god has said
But we're still standing here
Fuck you, we're still standing here

I don't know but I've been told
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold
Mmmmmm good
Feels good
Is good
Real good
Tastes good
Mighty good
Good for you
It's good for me

Gimme my bullet, gimme my gun
I'm gonna go out and kill for some fun
I kill without anger, I kill without remorse
I kill for my country and nothing more

Hatred, Hatred - That's why they want us dead
Hatred, Hatred - That's what their god has said
Hatred, Hatred - That's why they want us dead
Hatred, Hatred - That's what their fucking god has said
