(I kill without fear of consequence)

Voices in my head, guiding me and planning out your death
Fearless in my rise, to be the greatest killer of all time

I slip through the darkness and the shadows
My knife in my hand
Your spine chills as my eyes are upon you
You don't understand

I have all the power
You have all the blood
Eyes of fear and you beg me
As my knife finds its home

(I kill free of guilt or remorse)

Corpses rotting in my head, talk to me and lead me down my path
Butcher blood on my hands, the blade itself incites to deeds of violence

I kill with depraved indifference
I kill for the blood
All those who weep for my victims
They missed out on the fun

All the crying and the pleading as I ruin the flesh
Better look over your shoulder because you are next

(I kill without fear of god)

Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
