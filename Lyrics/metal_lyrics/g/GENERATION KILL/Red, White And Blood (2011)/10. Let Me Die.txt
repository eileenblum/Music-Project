I live my life and now I waste away
I feel the end is coming soon
I worked and slaved now tell me all for what
I'll die with nothing and no one

There's no way there's a god
No savior, no bright light
Eternal life, I think not
No need to cry, let me fucking die

So now it's time and I have no regrets
I've made the most of what I had
It's your right for you to have your faith
But it's my life and I say no

There's no way there's a god
No savior, no bright light
Eternal life, I think not
No need to cry, let me fucking die

I live my life and now I waste away
I feel the end is coming soon
I worked and slaved now tell me all for what
I'll die with nothing and no one

So now it's time and I have no regrets
I've made the most of what I had
It's your right for you to have your faith
But it's my life and I say no

There's no way there's a god
No savior, no bright light
Eternal life, I think not
No need to cry, let me fucking die
