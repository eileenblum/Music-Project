Precipice lechers feeding on the weak and the lost souls of the world
Filthy stink of violence and corruption, breeding societies of fear
Cultural murder, panic induced, witch hunt of the modern world
Those who will fight against the unjust, they will die and just disappear

A sickening darkness envelopes the world, we are lead by the criminally insane
Totally corrupted, morally dead, we are treated with total disdain
Slaves made of the innocent and guilty, they feed us all of their lies
Global pandemic, a virus of fear, for the future, no sun will rise

A feast for the wolves, we are their prey
A feast for the wolves, we've been betrayed

The young and the strong go off to war to die for their lies and deceit
The almighty dollar is the god that they trust, never will we come home in defeat
Stay til the end, whatever the price never admitting that they were wrong
Crippled and broken, never to be healed, with their lies, they strung us along

A feast for the wolves, we are their prey
A feast for the wolves, we've been betrayed

A feast for the wolves, we are their prey
A feast for the wolves, we've been betrayed

A feast for the wolves, we've been betrayed

We've been betrayed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
