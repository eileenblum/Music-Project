Awakened inside this nightmare, the dead have come back to life
Survivors hiding in the shadows and moving in the cover of night
Everyone you know is now dead in here looking to feed on the flesh
Soulless rotting monsters, no remorse for whoever is next

Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh
Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh

Running through the darkness, fear pumping through your veins
Gun in your hand, shoot to kill, a bullet right into the brain
Horror is all you feel, killing even the kids
Suicide is an option, hopeless is all you feel

Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh
Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh
Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh
Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh

Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh
Here come the walking dead
Coming for your flesh
