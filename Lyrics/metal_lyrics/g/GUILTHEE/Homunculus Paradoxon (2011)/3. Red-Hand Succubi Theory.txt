[SCENE II] 
[Laboratory. The succubi and THE MASTER are working.] 

[SUCCUBI] 
Just let me smell your blood 
Then the silent one started to whisper: 
Your flesh is mine too, 
Your blood is mine too, sister. 
Ssshh... Lock the door... Donât scream... 

[CHRONICLER] 
Beyond the centuries there there was 
An obnoxious soiled laboratory. 
One of Father Satanâs slaves 
Tried to test a deformity. 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS] 
So many tubes, 
Obscure liquid infectious aphrodisiac. 

[SUCCUBI] 
So many disasters, too much failure. 
Hallow voices sing: donât turn back! 
Give birth to Incest! 

[SISTER SUCCUBUS] 
A maniac starts a warfare, creates a hybrid 

[SUCCUBI]
Monster, against fragile nature. 
[The creature is born from the flask and the harvested young man seeds.] 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS]
I see pools of blood, feel like buried. 
A part of me is rising from hideous chemistry. 

[Watching the crawling creature.] 

She crawls on the floor closer, 
Wants to be connected. 

[SUCCUBI]
Sibling? Enemy? 

[SISTER SUCCUBUS]
Leech, but deadly wounded. 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS] 
Genetic malformation. 
I never thought Iâll go into madness. 
My cells are yearn into the sweet flames. 

(Mad warble...) 

[SUCCUBI]
Nothing comes for free. 
Illegal anatomy resulted in abomination, 
King of sin will punish us, reunite us 
Inside/outside my/your brain! 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS]
We both are human! 

[CREATURE]
Oh, wretch that I am! 
No human eye would see you again! 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS] 
Iâm a masterpiece! 

[CREATURE]
Just leave me to die! 
Dippelâs oil neither saves your life. 

[SISTER SUCCUBUS]
You have to terrible... 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS]
...Price to pay? Our tale is a demonâs ceremony. 

[SISTER SUCCUBUS]
Youâre my sweet donor. 

[RED-HAND-SUCCUBUS]
Soon Iâll be... 

[CREATURE]
Just blow my corpse up and leave me! 

[SUCCUBI]
[Setting the creature on fire with a torch.] 
Die again! Die again! 
You lusus naturae with damned red hands!
