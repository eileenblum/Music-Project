[SCENE IV] 

[THE MASTER Has a twinge of conscience.]
Night and day craving for the innocence. 
The words you say are killing me. 
Sitting here in the grave of tolerance. 
Have you hear: no one can be free. 
The architect build the world upon his word. 
There is no protect against the mystic spell. 
Do you believe the lowest element is earth. 
I do reveal a secret, mark it well. 

[CHRONICLER]
Craving for the innocence 
Waiting for the down of the new born son. 
New master is waiting for him. 
Yet one has killed the other one. 

[HERMES]
This place is callâd by many names. 
Far down below in the sulphur mist. 
Now the awkward doom is done. 
I will hang you by your left-hand wrist. 

[HERMES' DEMENTED PUPIL]
New born flesh you wanted I can give you. 
Fresh blood from opened throat can pour you. 
'You sick? To give you health I can spit you. 
And if you want to die I can help you.
