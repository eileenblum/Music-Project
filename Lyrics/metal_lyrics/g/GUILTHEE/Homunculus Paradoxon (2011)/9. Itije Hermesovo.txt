[SCENE V] 
[The old Master is crying out for Hermes in painful agony.] 

[THE MASTER]
Cloted blood in my head, 
Is waiting for the night by my side. 

[THE MASTER AND HIS DAIMONS] 
Come see me now! 

[HERMES Enters the room.] 

[THE MASTER Reaching out.] 
Hermes! 
[To Hermes.] 
Pripazi to Äine zlodusi da bi tobom vladali. 
Pokori se ocu svom i budi posluÅ¡ni sin. 

[THE MASTER AND HIS DAIMONS] 
Save yourself! Behold! Theyâre telling great lies. 

[THE MASTER]
You are right, by my side. 
Future is waiting. Youâre prepared. 

[HERMES' DEMENTED PUPIL]
La-la-la... 
[Poisons the Master.]
