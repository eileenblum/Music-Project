[SCENE II] 
[The final exam of young Hermes. Bridal party in Naples.] 

[THE MASTER]
[Offering the poison to the bride.] 
Aqua Toffana. 
Would you take it from me? 
Drink it if you need it for free! 

[HERMES]
Now we made the pain all vanish. 
With this elixir kill the Spanish! 
You will know the time is right now. 
On the yard he is milking the cow. 

[THE MASTER]
Now we made the pain all vanish. 
With this elixir kill the Spanish! 
You will know the time is right now. 
On the yard he is milking the cow. 

[RED-HAND SUCCUBUS] 
Mense majo nubut malae. 

[SUCCUBI AND HERMES] 
Manna di San Nikola. 
Nessuno nasce maestro. 

[THE MASTER To Hermes.] 
Mark my words young disciple, 
If you want to be a mage! 

[HERMES Speaking to himself.] 
Now prepare the poison, youngster! 
Let they taste our fearless power. 
You will know the time is right now. 
The bridal party has to die now. 

[THE MASTER]
Now we made the pain all vanish. 
With this elixir kill the Spanish! 

[To Hermes.]
For making a poison you donât need reason. 
It is implicit. 
Heart of the maiden, tongue of the raven 
It is all you need. Repeat! 

[HERMES Obediently.] 
For making a poison I donât need reason. 
It is implicit. 
Heart of the maiden, tongue of the raven 
It is all I need.
