This one you should not ever hide, cover, lend or borrow 
Just open your mouth but be aware because it's hard to swallow 
So when your throat is fraying I reckon I'm on my way... 

Straight to your heart, I'm falling right into your distinct spiral 
Gazeing the stripes of vortex which paint bodeful symptom's mural 
Liquid emotion controls how you stand the treatment... 

Can you really choose between false and true 
Still-birth-day or orphanage solitude 
Does opinion make the substantial food 
Or does it make a potion of poisoned brew 

Apollo sees me 
Asclepius chastises 
Regretful Hygieia 
Rueful Panacea 

Anger guides your weak hand and mend the track to a face to slap it 
Forgiveness is yours as it seems you fight with desperate anguish 
That's why I stuck inside your esophagus now I'm gonna 
Look for a bone melt into that to be close to your heart 

Is dignity of the human being 
Dependent on vacuum tube and syringe? 
There's no complaint from the departers 
But sometimes the spoil debate is malicious 

Apollo sees me 
Asclepius chastises 
Regretful Hygieia 
Rueful Panacea 

[Parts of the Hippocratic Oath] 

Is dignity of the human being 
Dependent on vacuum tube and syringe? 
There's no complaint from the departers 
But sometimes the spoil debate is malicious 

Forlorn misery 
Before you could choose 
Or final relief 
After decision 

Apollo sees me 
Asclepius chastises 
Regretful Hygieia 
Rueful Panacea
