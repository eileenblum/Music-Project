Only two days old and bites... 
Harmless ones live whilst they pass by 
Cutting glance from behind... 
Eyelids of nature of the hungry kind 

Growing silence as we learn... 
Important things about restrictions and terms 
Of being civil and selfless... 
Maybe we'll save a little space for them 

Feeding? No! - (way of the) uninhibited 
Simply wrong 
Martyrdom - (fully) unnecessary 
Underdog 
Breeding the load - (instead) you'd better 
Cure the sore 
Hideous hogs - they're just a... 

Ravenous greedy inordinate bevy 
with 
Spasmodic moving lurking leer 
and 
Maniac leaping dubious prestige 
so 
Appetizing gist degenerate being 

River of Barren Land conveys not too far - 'cause 
The finest component lacks from their mind 
Destruction against boon foresight 
Triggers dystopic visions - and even more lies 

Hey! 

Changing attire day by day... 
Beyond consuming they do only waste 
Our territory decays 
Proportionately with their torpid pace
