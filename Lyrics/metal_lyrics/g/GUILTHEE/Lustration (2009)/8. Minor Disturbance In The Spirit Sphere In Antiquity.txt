The Babylonian whore drink's thee blood. 
Buried eyes in her hand. 
She waits the bless' of new born flesh. 
In her womb blithering memories. 
Pleasure of pain. 

Of pain. 
This is the 
construction of your mind. 
The emptiness â 
measure of the human stain. 
With unholy 
thoughts of dignity. 
You are mine 
knife of agony.
