I am the Arch Enemy 
in your body of your mind. 
I will feed you with forbidden 
knowledge from the God's above. 

Look virgin this mellow fruits 
how beautiful they are. 
Do not be afraid just take it, 
eternal life will come. 

Oh! Lilith hear my words now! 
Do not you want to taste it yet? 
Be prudent, be immortal! 
Do not belive the lies He said. 

No women! Do not you dare it 
That has the Lord forbid! 
If you tear it, if you teast it 
you come to know the death. 

(Eat my Child... You will gain wisdom...) 

How beautiful fruits are indeed. 
They must be really tasty 
good for food and pleas'd for eye 
(You will gain wisdom...) 
Come husband taste it you too 
take a morsel from my hand! 
(Now you are mine...) 

(We are naked...) 

Your pitiful souls now are mine. 
Let us run Oh! my darling! 
Let us hide from the Lord! 
(I am te Arch Enemy 
of your God...) 
Let us cover are naked body 
I do not fell so safe in it. 

(SÃ¡tÃ¡ni kacaj) 

How beautiful fruits are indeed. 
They must be really tasty 
good for food and pleas'd for eye 
(We will gain wisdom...) 
Come husband taste it you too 
take a morsel from her hand! 
(Now we are yours...) 
Go run Oh! my sinners! 
Go hide from your Lord! 
(You are te Arch Enemy 
of our God...) 
Better cover your naked body. 
Better cover your naked body with dust.
