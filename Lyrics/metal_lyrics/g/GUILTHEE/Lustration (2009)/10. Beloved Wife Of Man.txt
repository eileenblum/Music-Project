Hear my words now flower from the garden. 
Hear the truth of your winsome husband. 

How he died, by my hand. 
The Prophet spoke to me 
through the ashes of the bones. 
I break into a cold sweat. 
From the fire spoken golden ones. 

We used to fight together 
my sword shield' his life. 
He saved me thousand times, 
In the battles. 
But I was possessed by his wife. 

One night, on a foreing land 
he sleept near by my bed 
I put my conscience to silence 
I drow my knife, and stabed his neck 
He's solid dead, in coffin bed 
far away in monastery 

Svjati Boze [6x] 

Your oath belongs to me my dearest. 
My wedded wife. 
Unfortunately I am not with you now, on your rugged/raged path. 
Woman, beyond the grave I see the tormented pain of your heart. 
But please complay with his words 
and kill the bastard wile he is a sleep. 
Lett him be coursed! 
Forewer... 

Beloved wife of man 
defenseless creature 
the vengeance will be full 
from the fire spoken golden ones. 

The wedlock hymn was bitter 
She obey the words. 
She was his humble servant 
To fulfill the husband's curse. 

One night, on the bed of down 
she's barely sleep near by the vile 
She put her conscience to silence 
She drow the knife, and stabed his neck 
He's solid dead, in coffin bed 
He's solid dead, in sinful bed.
