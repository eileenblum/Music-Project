First my love I found in the morning 
her blessed eyes seduced my youngster superstition. 
She was young, and she was fair, 
she was the silver dawn of my life. 
â The man's who built the torture chamber. â 

The second one I found at midday 
her blessed kisses seduced my manhood. 
She was mature, and she was fair, 
she was the golden Sun of my life. 
â The man's who fought a thousand battles. â 

(Oh, my Lord I cant take this burden! 
They art so richer. Far more then I am.) 

The third I found late at night, 
her wisdom presage my twilight. 
â The man's who had blood-stained jewels. â 
Oh, she was solemn! 

(Oh, my Lord I cant take this burden! 
She is so solemn. Far more the I am. 
Oh, my Lord I cant take this burden! 
They art so richer. Far more then I am.) 

The fourth I found in my darkest hour. 
Thou art fairest among all them! 
Thou art the queen in my fragrant garden! 
Oh, thou art my darkness! 

Radiant, royal, matchless beauty. 
You will ever live immortal. 
You will treasure all my riches. 
You will bled to feed my flowers. 
You will enlarge my dark kingdom. 
all is yours now. 

Radiant, royal, matchless beauty. 
You will ever live immortal. 
You will treasure all my riches. 
You will bled to feed my flowers. 
You will enlarge my dark kingdom. NOW!
