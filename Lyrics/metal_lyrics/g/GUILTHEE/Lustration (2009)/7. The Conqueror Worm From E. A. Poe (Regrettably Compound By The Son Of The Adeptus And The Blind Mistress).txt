Lo! 'this a gala night 
within the lonesome latter years! 
An angel trongh, bewinged, bedight 
in veils, and drowned in tears, 

sit in a theatre, to see 
a play of hopes and fears, 
while the orchestra breathes fitfully 
the music of the spheres. 

It writhes! â it writhes â with mortal pangs 
the mimes become its food, 
and seraphs sob at verming fangs 
in human gore imbued. 

Mimes, in the form of God on high, 
mutter and mumble low, 
and hither and thither fly - 
mere puppets they, who come and go 
at bidding of vast formless things 
thath shift the scenery to and fro, 
flapping from outh their Condor wings 
invisible Woe! 

It writhes! â it writhes â with mortal pangs 
the mimes become its food, 
and seraphs sob at verming fangs 
in human gore imbued. 

Out â out are the lights â out all! 
And, over each quivering form 
the curtain, a funeral pall, 

comes down with the rush of a storm 
while the angels, all pallid and wan, 
uprising, unveiling, affirm 
that the play is the tragedy âMan,â 
and its hero the Conqueror Worm. 

Thath motley drama â oh, be sure 
it shall not be forgot! 
With its Phantom chased for evermore, 
by a crowd that siez it not, 

trough a circle that ever returned in 
to the self-same spot, 
and much of Madness, and more of Sin, 
and Horror the soul of the plot. 

It writhes! â it writhes â with mortal pangs 
the mimes become its food, 
and seraphs sob at verming fangs 
in human gore imbued. 

But see, amid the mimic rout 
a crawling shape intrude! 
A blood-red thing that writhes from out 
the scenic solitude! 

It writhes! â it writhes â with mortal pangs 
the mimes become its food, 
and seraphs sob at verming fangs 
in human gore imbued.
