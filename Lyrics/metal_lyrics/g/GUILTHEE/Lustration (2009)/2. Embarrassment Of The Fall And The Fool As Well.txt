Like breathe of naked bodies 
sometime you remind me the sin. 
Hell as soundless well 
takes my head and spirit away. 

Your slow motion seduce me 
to drop out, to go away, 
to tear to pieces all my wounds, 
and flood your greedy body. 

You must be my punishment. 
Suffering facing your mouth, 
suffering seeing your face. 
Lusting for unfulfilled. 
Suffering facing your mouth, 
Suffering seeing your face. 
Touch of your neck 
to fell the sweetnes. 
Embarrassment of the Fall. 3x 
Embarrassment of the Fool... 

Your body flew like a feather. 
I hold it like a silky veil 
just to make our damnation sweeter. 
Your eyes gazing in the Sun. 

Like breathe of naked bodies 
sometime you remind me the sin. 
Hell as soundless well 
takes my head and spirit away. 

Once when I was walking there 
not in human form. 
Withouth life in my shell. 
I was dead. 
And when the Sun paints the sky, 
when your body feeds my eye with naked dignity; 
your liquid spine runs into mine. 

Weâve alredy become one 
with the woods of distant thoughts. 
Ruins of our reeking body lie waste. 
I took your broken arm, 
and you rattle my bones. 
I want to piece out your parts 
what your raging soul has torn. 

You're playig with my cheekbone. 
Purple raindrops bath your skin. 
I lift your arms, your eyes above 
to die without touching you. 

You must be my punishment. 
Suffering facing your mouth, 
suffering seeing your face. 
Lusting for unfulfilled. 
Suffering facing your mouth, 
Suffering seeing your face. 
Touch of your neck 
to fell the sweetnes. 
Embarrassment of the Fall. 3x 
Embarrassment of the Fool... 

Once when I was walking there 
not in human form. 
Withouth life in my shell. 
I was dead. 
And wen the Sun paints the sky, 
when your body feeds my eye with naked dignity; 
your liquid spine runs into mine. 

Weâve alredy become one 
with the woods of distant thoughts. 
Ruins of our reeking body lie waste. 
I took your broken arm, 
and you rattle my bones. 
I want to piece out your parts 
what your raging soul has torn.
