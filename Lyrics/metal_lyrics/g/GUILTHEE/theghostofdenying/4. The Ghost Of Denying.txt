Sometimes I fold my hands to prayer 
But I never get an answer 
You're sitting on your throne 
And punish the dying world with cancer 
I see your face 
Your skin is wrinkled and pale 
I see your flock 
Blind idiots cry for their hail 
But the sin and pain and sacrifices 
They are sworn to the damn 
They burn the cradles and burn the graves 
This world's using up them 
New Armageddon, troops are marching 
I despise compassion 
Unholy ghost of holy denying 
This is our passion 
God-dam! 
Look into yourself and realize your state 
Your conscience is buried by your hate 
You've lived like a scum, like a vile ban 
But you want to die like a human 
God-dam! 
Your hope will never open the gate 
You can't keep clear of your fate 
You've lived like a scum and you die like that 
Let's face eternity you living dead 
Drop dead! 
I am the ghost of world's denying 
I was born when purity was dying 
I am the ghost of your incredulity 
There's no escape, we're all guilty
