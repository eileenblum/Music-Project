Break it up now! 
I'm a soul collector, I see into your darkest fear 
It brings me in motion, I come and I suffer, I bear 
Break it up now! 
I find pleasure in your sickness 
This is your doom, I am the witness 
Your teardrops are grazenig my skin 
Your scream will cover up your sin 
I'll take your life as you took mine 
I'll snap you up without a sign 
Take it, break it, fake it 
Break it up now! 
No one can feel what I felt 
No one believed I'm a vector 
I can't keep my hate well in hand 
I have became a collector 
Take it, break it, fake it 
Break it up now! 
Face the truth you're begging for nothing 
Your soul is rotted by my loathing 
My teardrops are quenching your thirst 
Our souls are naked through the burst
