I will cut letters out from my skin 
I'll write characters with my blood 
I'll draw my faces with my ribs 
I'll form the tumble of my god 
'Cause he failed me, I overkill 
He failed me with my last will 
I draw my faces with my ribs, 
I scratch seven lines into you 
You can't escape from my grip, 
but you've had the chance all through 
You're laying next to me on the ground 
It's not my face what you have found 
Where the beast sleeps lightly we find Almighty 
Dead... go! 
Lust, pride, wrath, envy 
- I feel so empty 
Lust, wroth, sloth, gluttony 
- I am your worst enemy 
Now I see, you are just dying next to me 
I was too blind to realize 
There's something more in your eyes 
I'm not alone... 
'Cause he failed me, I overkill 
He failed me with my last will 
Where I am nobody, you feel my body 
Lust, pride, wrath, envy 
- I feel so empty 
Lust, wroth, sloth, gluttony 
- I am your worst enemy
