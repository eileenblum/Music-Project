Traitors, liars, up there who pulls the wires 
For the sake of the gain 
They pull the trigger again 
Black suit with a briefcase 
Don't hide the Evil's face 
Will we ever find somebody? 
Our graves are stuffed with money... in the Hell! 
Corrupt lawyer-Tycoon slaughter 
But the end is near and the pushing gets higher 
You're the corpse and we are the fire 
Marching through a conquered nation 
Humans feed the holy cremation 
Bow down to the flag of the murder 
Our hate will release the burner 
Preaching in the name of the saviour 
With the weapon of the god's favour 
The end is near and the pushing gets higher 
You're the corpse and we are the fire 
Who will find the way? 
The way out from this hell 
Who will find the way? 
Profit? What a sell? 
Tear down the walls of the dead! 
Tear it down, don't bow your head!
