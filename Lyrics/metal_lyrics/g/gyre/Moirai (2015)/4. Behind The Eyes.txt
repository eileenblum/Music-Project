All they see and all they do comes back to you.
All they see and all they do falls back to you.

On and on and on they follow a dangled dream so hollow.
On and on and on they wallow, heads down, questions swallowed.
But who are we to set them free?

So why are we the ones who see right through your two faces?
Why are we the ones who see the lies behind your eyes?

On and on and on they wallow, heads down, questions swallowed.

So why are we the ones who see right through your two faces?
Why are we the ones who see the lies behind your eyes?

Oh, youâll show them the light, and then you tell them the price.
Oh, youâll show them the light, and you tear out their eyes.

Can't fathom outside of your mind
a degree doesn't give you the right to make us lab rats
for a non-existent disease.
Brainwash it down with a glass of apathy.
and watch the clock-hand go round and count your years goodbye.
Giving up has never felt so right.

Lies behind the eyes
They always know the truth

To see you standing waiting,
Behind the doorâ¦
Is exactly where they want you.
The choice was always yours.

Assimilation, illusions of somebody's dream. They sold out on, that you bought into. He's got a nice new suit to shake your hand in, to shake you down with. Integrated for a lifetime of lies to keep you in the red

You've fallen to this nightmare,
You're slipping through the seams
You've fallen to your worst fears
and you might never see.

So why are we the ones who can see right through your two faces?
Why are we the ones who can see the lies behind your eyes?
Oh, youâll show them the light, and then you tell them the price.
Oh, youâll show them the light, and then you tear out their eyes.
