We are all born unfree.
Slaves to our own dire needs.
Drowning in the sea of empty mediocrity
Can we untie ourselves
From the puppet strings that control.
our facet souls
and reality.
That you can't see,
Is how you see,
And now that you see all of these blind thoughts are... lies.
To breed more lies

So free your mind
and take it all back.
to live your own life and live on your own terms

And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Another choice for your life
And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Before the lies are all you see.

So rise, rise, rise, rise
or we will never breath the sanctity of war that sets you free

To make your truth
as you open your eyes to see
the right, to fight
to watch all the prophecies die.

And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Another choice for your life.
And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Before your world comes crashing down.
And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Before the lies are all you see.

So please, release and see that we were meant to breath.
So please, release and see that we were meant to breath.

Running down to the last drop of blood
They'll never stop tasting our fears 'til we die
with our weaknesses, reborn from pain.
so redirect
the mislead afflictions
That will never cease.

And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Another choice for your life
And see that we were meant to breath, so I release
Before the lies are all you see.
All you see
All you see
