We dream the obscene, nothings as it seems.

Pulled into the void.
Know, but fall to the noise.
Captivated by what couldn't be,
manipulated by your own signs.

Faster and faster we spiral down into the end.

You're too far gone to see
A never ending spiral into fear.
bite down, look around, and you be the judge.
Have you crossed that line?

Dream the obscene

Head space, crowded in wars
to discover what was already there.
Horizons on so long,
manipulated by your own signs

You're too far gone to see
A never ending spiral into fear.
bite down, look around, and you be the judge.
Have you crossed that line?

Dream the obscene
Dream the obscene

Faster and faster we spiral down into the end, nothings as it seems.

Sheâs gone away, weâre on our way. Sheâs gone away,
We must strive, to all ends, any less is not an option.
for we will thrive on this edge.

You know one day you'll see that you have died.
that you've been drifting so far gone inside.
and if we offer hope it will subside
To all the waves within the tide. Wash it away.

Sheâs gone away, weâre on our way. Sheâs gone away,
We must strive, to all ends, any less is not an option.
for we will thrive on this edge.
