Breath in, breath outâlet in to let out.
Breath in, breath outâgive in to get out.

Into this light, so cold, the bite injects our souls
The threads have begun, to life we are spun

Sewing always, they weave in threes.

Drowning. Born unfree
Is this fate? Born unfree.
Oh Clotho, set me free.

Sewing always, they weave in threes.

Drowning. Born unfree
Is this fate? Set me free
To all our dire needs.
This burdens far too great.

So burn the cords
and cut the ties
and be the voice
that holds your fate

Let not fear guide

The third day has come.

Let not fear guide, so rise

And see that we were meant to breath so I release, another choice for your life.

Let not fear guide.

She's gone away, so take your place.
or we will live in/lose to fear

Let not fear guide.

Watch all the prophets die
then free your mind
to take it back
and live on your own terms.

Why bow to something when there's nothing there?
Let me tell you about the god inside.
Reality, outside the mind,
Break free from the chains that hold you down.

Why bow to something when there's nothing there?
Let me tell you about the god inside.

You are the one who holds your soul.

We are the ones who take control
We break free, and rise

Don't be the writing on the wall

Tear down all the images of fear that reprise these lies.

Rewrite, and revise,
or we will sacrifice another lie
before you die
It's up to you
to make this life

You've fallen to this nightmare,
You're slipping through the seams
You've fallen to your worst fears
Cause we all must fall down (and you might never see)

Let not fear guide

Back to where we once came,
We are stardust.
She won't give a damn about your past or future

Let not fear guide.
