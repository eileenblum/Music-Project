Donât you see
what we'll be?
Donât you feel,
that we choose to make things real.

But you caved too god damn soon,
and we knew you would to.

Can you choose not what to say?
Can you choose what not to do?

So tell me people are you all slaves?
That use their language to deceive.

So tell me people can you even see?
They use their language to deceive.

Were using ours to break freeâ¦

Your fears won't give, a damn about your past or future.

Light could show you. faith could lose you
They could guide you to nothing.
You'll die inside, so ask yourself, who are you?

But you caved too god damn soon, and we knew you would to, in due time.

When you finally realize all your wasted time and your lies.
When you finally see the truth, that its all been up to youâ¦
Only then you'll rise.

Donât you see what we will be?

Sworn to lie and trapped to die in your own mind
In due time, you can say it day long
But count for the fall
Until the end
that you are your own
or truly a lost soul

When you confide inside and see that you are gone.
Hate will breed and show you all the meanings.
in due time.

When you finally realize all your wasted time and your lies.
When you finally see the truth, that its all been up to youâ¦
Only then you rise.
