A seedless tree... roots clutched and burnt. For when they're still draped in flesh, and their dreams feel whole again.

Vultures soar over us, they seek nothing but death and decay.

Thousands fold. They're now surrounded... they're now the center... the spokes to a wheel.

Vultures soar over us, they seek nothing but death and decay.

The moments we live.
The hours we hold.
The days we feel free.
Hold on to them all.

Work through the hours that haunt you and move through the moments that are hard to forget.

Vultures soar over us, they seek nothing but death and decay.

The moments we live.
The hours we hold.
The days we feel free.
I wave and greet them all.

Close our eyes, let wind whisper by.

Something's got to give... unconscious... unnerving... and self obsessed.
Notice what's become of us.

Circle to feed, I wave and greet.
