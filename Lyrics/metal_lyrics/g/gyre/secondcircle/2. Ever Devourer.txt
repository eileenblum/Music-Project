Subjects in a game for conquest, destroy all we had to gain.
All is waste and void turned spittle from the mouth of a drunk.
Hide in a heartless city, listen for the sirens' call that never was.
A loving mother force feeds her children, hoping for a new home that never was.

Gone... structures fall to the sea.
Angered... waves as they flee.
Mother... gave us all she could,
Which... could not sustain our greed.

When our wants exceed our needs... the Black Wolf,
the Ever Devourer.

The incessant... the unceasing consumer.
Always waiting for the mother to release her young.

That never was... a loving mother force feeds her children, hoping for a new home that never was.
Hoping for a new world to call our own.
All is waste and void turned spittle from the mouth of a drunk.
Hide in a heartless city, listen for the sirens' call.
