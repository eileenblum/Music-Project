Those eyes when closed, all returns to nothing.
Your tears are the water, the currents - they bathe within blades of grass.
See all, feel all, would be too much to...

Those eyes, open, all will be revealed.
Eyes to see and mouths to breath.
The heart must feed the need to quench the thirsty.
Your tears are the water the currents - they bathe within blades of grass.
See all, feel all would be too much embrace.

Your senses, as filters- keeping you in and out of touch.

When the mind's given up on the eye, all other senses seem to peak - sound, feel, taste and smell - our means to survive.

And then do you see the next ridge ahead.
After the valley - the end - that is where...
Hours in time we will still stare with eyes that feed, hearts that greed... for life and more life and more life and more... life.
