Forcing inside the outlet.
Searching to reach the source.

We are the pilot on the cusp of a great storm.
No horizon in a room without doors.

To a place where no one knows of forgiveness or of sin.
We will roam across a long dark range.
We will write across a star lit sky.
One mind, one shell, one soul, one life.

So, How'd you get so far away?

I close my eyes to see the inner light within me.
How'd you get so far away?
My home, my life...
How'd you get so far away?
My home, my life...
And give back what's received.
Inside and out, I am everything we see.
One soul, one life.
