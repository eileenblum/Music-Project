(Tighten the Gyre)

Nothing but our power and will
Pinpoint us where we stray
It keeps us safe and sane

Limbs no longer rooted into the ground
Swaying in our disarray
We recognize our fatal flaw for what it is

Seeking pity from a pitiless sun
Tighten the gyre

Designing the backdrop to a stage of existence
Relying on a single step to obtain our resistance

Pinpointed where we stray
Swaying in our disarray
It keeps us safe and sane
We recognize our fatal flaw
And what we have to make of it

And we will wander
Further into unknown spaces
The pull is stronger
Down in the tightening gyre

So save our-selves
Save our-selves
