Caught in the undertow
Forget your dreams of home
Shattered illusions of control facing bleakness eternal all alone
Crawling grasping nothing can overcome its hold
Clawing, gasping, nothing can overcome its hold

I give in, so let it drag me in, let it drag me down,
Let it drag me deep withinâ¦ this

It could be the cause of everything
Revolving faster and faster in a ring
The falcon has found its master

Choking, grasping, drag me into the void
Revolving faster and faster and faster in a ring
The falcon has found its master.

We must evacuate, trying to escape a fate we created

Lifeless vision, validates decisions
In every contradiction
To wake us from our doom
To wake us from our doom
