Ripping Apart
Our self-centered consciousness
We lose our humanity
As it destroys
Everything that divides
Becoming one with the infinite

Rise, Rise
Keep all the thoughts that are left aligned

No time to breath

Now we are here
Everywhere, but nowhere
Folding in on our-selves.
Swallowed up by the universe.

Rise, Rise
Save all the breath that we sanctify

Now decide, kill the thoughts that were left

I fall in
Into myself
I fall into myself

I see it
It waits for me
Patiently waits for me

Beyond the pleasure
Beyond the pain
Beyond desire
Beyond the shame

Eternity Awaits
