Sunset
Evoke a plot askew
Like Cain of Genesis
Where tempted hearts subdue
Exalt Rome's chilling nemesis
With another slay anew
As wide-eyed power grew
Free the mind of Christogenesis
Blinding all, that bastard Jesus

Cicuta virosa

On this violent night
Where the grinning moon shines
Custa came enwreathed in mist
Take this wine to wicked glory
Tell the mass of spasm stories
And keep this secret muted, mine and thine

Now upon a youthful life
Britannicus bane a kin demise
This entrant into sin

This night
Evokes a freshly rule
Under pregnant skies
Of envious blood feud
Tonight, sip the chilled wine
Kill in the dead of night
Swifter than viper bites
Pounding heart of last goodbyes
Epileptic fits and fatal cries

Cicuta gloriam

And once he passed the veil of life between
Contortioned limbs and flayed frenzied themes
His jaw dropping shrieks of yelping screams
Swathed the heartless in this banquet scene

Ruthless deeds of jealousies
Preyed to twist this destiny
And in this witching hour

Murder!

On this vicious night
Where the grinning moon shines
Thus she spoke enwreathed in mist
Take this lead to crooked glory
My poison drink to dynasty
Now grant my vast estate of paradise

Now upon a youthful life
Britannicus slain a kin demise
This entrant into crime

The author of sin with batshit grins
Flanked and preyed in the howling winds
Lord Lucifer, amen
This appetite for malice whims
Helped draw a third of stars to him
Lord Lucifer, amen
May flights of demons wing this rest
In wicked glory to thrive and wrest
Lord Lucifer, amen

As love secretes the thrill for war
Encunted by her rear and fore
Stripped and gripped
Beseeching more and more
Cling to me and fuck me sore
As thou bedight my Roman lord
And curse my soul forever wanting more

Eyes now locked to hexing kiss
A nightly bliss that seems amiss
With fervid lust, that carnal fucking whore
