Their grasp of power and flanked desire
Wickedness scours the earth
Her beckoned call to exalt Nero
With murder in the first
Locusta, Pina and Halotus
Rogues and the likes of those
Show the wealth from high above
As limestone peaks on Jericho's road

Potens Satanas
Dona regni
Potens Satanas
Dona virtute

Unleash this legacy of death and deviltry
Black art narratives with godless poetry

Kindred enemies
A cutthroat foulness taking this reign
Regal fantasies
Of ancient parasites in these walls
Ruthless heresies
From Hell and Rome and their control

The sway emerged of twain bloodline
Both will clash for reign
Clasped as drowning swains in tides
Lured by the coveted gain
And though His eyes gleamed of spite
Transfixed by gilded thrones
They cling to this bequeathing Reich
With Satanic deadly rites

Potens Satanas
Dona regni
Potens Satanas
Dona virtute

Dishes ripe with succulent fare
One thread spun from Morta's twine
And on this night of toxic despair
Sovereignty was now espied

Severed ties as Lamb to Judas
Lustrous coins with treasonous kiss
Calvary's grim of spitefulness
Nails and grief for thirty dirty bliss

Deathless like the Gods
Tyrantcrats exalt from pawns
Majestic wrath with years among
On their softened wool
Like the persecution song
With sisters of the cloth
As the pretty little elder whore
Arched on His phallus lap

Remain abreast and lust for me
Younger grips began tragedy
Gilded cunt worship from thee
Skyclad aroused in wanton blasphemy
I am thine amorally
Sultry tongues with seventh heaven fucks
Spitting on God and his decree

Nona; Decima; Morta

Cunning masks of Romancrats
Grand courtships writhe in this grasp
Darker themes now permit at last

Kindred enemies
A cutthroat foulness twofold reign
Regal fantasies
As merging forces run amok
Ruthless heresies
From Hell and Rome for total control.
