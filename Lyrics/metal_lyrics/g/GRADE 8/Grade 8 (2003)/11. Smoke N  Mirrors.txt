If I had a disguise,
If I Trust your kind,
Continue to clean smoke n' mirrors.
Cause' I've seen it all before.
If I live through another day
I might as well bow down,
Bow down and be your slave.
So come help out and dig my grave,
Because I refuse to lose.
Cause' I have no time for your complications, confrontations, explanations.
And every time I tried to talk to you to find the truth,
You just refused and pushed me away!
Cause' I've seen it all before.
And I know your kind.
Push me, Push me!
If I Head up the skies,
If I Trust your kind,
Continue to clean smoke n' mirrors.
Cause' I've seen it all before.
