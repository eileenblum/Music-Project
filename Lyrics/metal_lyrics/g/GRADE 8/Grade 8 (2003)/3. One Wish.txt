So here we are all alone now, 
hold me close, tell me lies
this isn't home and this isn't right
not gonna stand here and wait for something I can't...
please, please just set me free
I feel the heat so why am I cold,
just cant seem to let you go
cause' you still want a piece and I need it all,
lights were on when there was no one home
when you'd invite me in and then you'd shut the door
before I clutched my palm I could feel you stare,
nothing between us but family.
So please listen close, my story goes on
Friends are leaving as we're growing old,
Count miles back and I'm out the door,
So I'd better tell myself I'm never coming home.
Everybody says "play by the rules"
Shut your mouth and just play it cool,
Go on and pay your dues, forget that!
That's what came before.
Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
And give me just one chance, chance! Chance! Chance!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
And give me just one...
Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
And give me just one chance, chance! Chance! Chance!
I think we have contact...
So here we are all alone now, 
hold me close, tell me lies
this isn't home and this isn't right
not gonna stand here and wait for something I can't...
breath, breath and feel diseased
well you all can see its not time to leave,
how's it feel to be complete?
don't stop me now cause' I can almost reach,
pull myself out of another hole,
take it to them but don't talk to me
cause' you cant relate
no need to rush, I'm already late,
and in this case my world is erased out and pulled my face down
straight from the grave and I see tonight,
straight from out my lies, roll your eyes,
cool me down, I need to find.
Take my hand in spite of me
Cause' I'm on my knees and I'm begging please
Need a taste of what I crave
What I crave is fate!
I think we have contact...
