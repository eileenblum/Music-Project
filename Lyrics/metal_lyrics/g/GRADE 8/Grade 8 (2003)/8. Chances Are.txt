Chances are...
Chances are I'd be dead if I never left
I need some truth to believe, 
I'm just inside a disease.
I need to rest peaceful in my mind
That is before I reach the level of the freaks.
Oh my god, look a locomotive,
Words that were spoken, leave her choking,
Heading home when you know this,
My world trying to hold this, slipping through my fingers
And I know this.
Burn bridges, pulling arms out of sockets till I'm finished.
Then I race inside my head.
Couldn't bet I wish I had one chance to go back and change the past...
But the chances are I'd be dead if I never left.
Chances are...
Chances are...
Chances are I'd be dead if I never left.
Cause' I never listen to suspicions,
Always trust my intuitions, my decisions.
My minds always ticking and as fast as that,
But I'm calm like a child.
You wanna take no day, get closeness,
Seeing the corrosion running through the ocean,
Overall there open.
This time he's lost it!
So what about your last chance.
So please believe that I'm gonna keep on moving,
Looking for solutions.
Neglected, I've felt it, infected, I corrected...
Wish I had one chance to go back and change the past...
But the chances are I'd be dead if I never left.
Chances are...
Chances are...
Chances are I'd be dead if I never left.
Where were ya then?
Where are ya now?
Heads in the clouds,
I got my feet on the ground.
Chances are I'd be dead if I never left.
You sense it!
(I sense it!)
So what ya gonna do about it!!!
