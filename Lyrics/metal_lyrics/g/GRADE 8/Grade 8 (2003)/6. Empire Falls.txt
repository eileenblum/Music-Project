Things will never change,
Things will never,
Things will never change.
Step into the realm,
And watch the empire fall,
Stepping into the realm,
And watch the empire fall.
Too young to understand I'm nothing less than a man,
I'll move the earth but first I need a fresh place to stand,
Cause' its my mother, my father, the preachers, teachers
Everybody and my self overall,
Don't ask me why they try!
Cause' everybody feels alone,
Where am I supposed to go,
Battlefields at home.
Now we're all lost in it ofcourse.
Emotions and alcohol contribute to the downfall.
Now just sit by and watch an empire fall.
Things will never change,
Things will never,
Things will never change.
Stood by and watched the empire fall.
Now I won't cry while I watch it drop
Things will never change,
Things will never,
Things will never change.
Sometimes I'm not informed of reasons straight to the present,
I know right where I'm heading,
Now I'm over this I'll give the credit.
We were wrong at times, ain't even gonna try to lie
Feeling like I should cry when I watch it drop!
I feel alone
No love lost in it ofcourse.
Now I'll tell you the truth we're getting better,
But to be honest far from above the pressure.
Things will never change
Things will never change
Things will never change
Stood by and watched an empire fall.
So give me three, four, five more minutes please in my sleep
In my dreams, only place that I really feel free.
