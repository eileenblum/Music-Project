1, 2, 3, 4!
Another day to celebrate,
Another, Another day.
Another day in the life we're living
We're never forgotten, never forgiven.
Two more thousand faces I'm taking with us.
When I should really thank em' for every time they lied and played,
Obeyed and stayed for just another day to celebrate!
One day for everything and who we compensate,
For every mistake and every precious thing we break!
Just one more day...
Cause' I just want to celebrate another day of living,
And I just want celebrate another day of life.
GO!
Watch it all go away!
Cause' I just want to celebrate another day of living,
And I just want celebrate another day of life.
From across this, promise all this,
All the sons and all the daughters.
And remember watching face and to just stand up straight,
Clean your plate, clean up all the floors,
Do whatever I tell you to do.
And tell the truth,
Baby I got news for all of you,
Keep the faith,
Do whatever it takes
Cause tonight we're staying up late and celebrate for you that lit the fuse.
I just want to celebrate another day of living,
And I just want celebrate another day of life.
