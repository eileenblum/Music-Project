Cause' I wanna be light as a feather.
Cause' this is what I figure with finger upon on the trigger
Than living another day of stress at best
I guess, one last breath I guess we're one day closer
And my fists are sober.
And like nothing in the world can beat the trash
That we hold forever and forever more
Rule the world with all my flaws.
I wanna be...
Cause' I wanna be....
Jump on up and down and shake the ground
Just a little freak.
YA HEADCASE, YA HEADCASE!
Pulling out my hair you'll always stare
Just a little freak.
YA HEADCASE, YA HEADCASE!
Cause' I wanna be light as a feather.
Just a little tweaked
Just a little freaked out inside that's all
Inside the world we live in
Cause' I'm claustrophobic and anti social
And lets get this show, now we'll watch your heads roll.
So look at me now!
And I'd rather be beneath the seats, biting my nails, grinding my teeth
Mind, body and soul
Lose control so don't lay down next to me.
Jump on up and down and shake the ground
Just a little freak.
YA HEADCASE, YA HEADCASE!
Pulling out my hair you'll always stare
Just a little freak.
YA HEADCASE, YA HEADCASE!
