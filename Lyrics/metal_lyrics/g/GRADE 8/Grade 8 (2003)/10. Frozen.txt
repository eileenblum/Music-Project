You left me by my side.
Never planned it,
I gotta learn what just happened,
Eyes focused.
Hands shaking, body breaking,
Something's going down,
What! You play me for a clown?
So STOP!
You let me sell my whole life,
Oh you think you're so hot all around,
But you're done now.
Stole that little kiss from the lips of a lyricist.
YOU'RE LEFT BY MY SIDE!!!
You left me paralyzed,
You left me by my side.
Hold me down,
That's enough.
You left me by my side.
Stole that little kiss from the lips of a lyricist,
Okay I'll make it quick, all of this, all of what we dreamed.
Sure well we're stronger than ever before,
All my scars gotta leave em all.
Now that they're all gone and the war has been cheated on before,
Now that one soldier cant climb over this concrete wall.
So what are ya saying, quit complaining
Like a coward little baby when your conscience is gaining!
Because your frontin' from nothing,
Though everybody's frontin' baby,
Show me something,
All across the land, all across the world.
Left hypnotized.
YOU'RE LEFT BY MY SIDE!!!
You left me paralyzed,
You left me by my side.
Hold me down,
That's enough.
You left me by my side.
