I heard the sound of the thunder in the sky
Now thereâs no time to back home
Eagles are flyinâ
Fire and lightning fall down to the ground
This is the time for the brave to be proud

I must fight I must fly
As an Eagle in the sky
My claws will strike fast as blinding light
And my enemies burn tonight

There goes the siren that warns you of the raid
Eagles are ready to fall in their grave
Fire is dancing in the nightly sky
Is there a tomorrow for you and for my life?

I must fight I must fly
As an Eagle in the sky
My claws will strike fast as blinding light
And my enemies burn tonight
