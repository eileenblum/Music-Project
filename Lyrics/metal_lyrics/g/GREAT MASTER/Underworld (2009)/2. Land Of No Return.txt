Towards the dream
Through the sky and into the sea
Iâm running to discover
The land of my God

I know I can only count on me
My hands and my strengh
My mind will fly so high
In the cold blue sky

My mission is my aim
In a land of no return
Heaven is calling for my name

Only with your blood Iâll stop my hate
Iâm not afraid of fear, death and pain
With my faith Iâll run to my brothers âcause
Iâm a warrior my God

Riding in the wind
My sword falls from the sky
My vengeance now is near
And fear reigns over my men

The war has begun
And the shadow now has come
I walk into the light
And I will fight till I die

My mission is my aim
In a land of no return
Heaven is calling for my name

Only with your blood Iâll stop my hate
Iâm not afraid of fear, death and pain
With my faith Iâll run to my brothers âcause
Iâm a warrior my God
