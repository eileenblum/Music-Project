Walking in the dream in a secret place
Something watches me hidden and sheltered
In the forest reigns only a strange light
Everything is magic and enchanted

Now I run to the hill I fear for my life
Something follows me Something follows me
Running against time âcause the night is here
I heard a sweet music in the air

Sweet notes calling my heart
And my fear now is gone

Now I see a circle made of mushrooms
The moonlight brighten the glass inside of it
I donât believe my eyes âcause
The music calls me inside

No man goes where they donât know
Your future is expecting you
You must turn around the circleâs ground
but donât go inside or you will be

Lost in the circle of fairies
Where youâll dance for all the time
And the light of the moon
Will heat your heart in the night
You are dancing in the circle with fairies
Where you dance up to the end
Without a friend you canât escape
You are lost in the circle of your fate

The magic circle is a trap for all men
Itâs dangerous for the one who enters
You can see the fairies turning around nine times
under the full moon and his bright light

But Iâm attracted by the musicâs charm
Jumping as a mad Iâve begun to dance
Now Iâm a prisoner of my sad fate
For Seven years I will jump because Iâm

Lost in the circle of fairies
Where youâll dance for all the time
And the light of the moon
Will heat your heart in the night
You are dancing in the circle with fairies
Where you dance up to the end
Without a friend you canât escape
You are lost in the circle of your fate
