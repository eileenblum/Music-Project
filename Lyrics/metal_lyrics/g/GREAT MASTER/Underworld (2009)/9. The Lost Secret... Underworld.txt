Under the sky under the moon and under all signs
Into the wind that strong comes from the east

Thereâs a tall wall on the hill and is secure his name
Because for so long the hands of god have protected his place
If a wind of death comes now
It will find only a hollow sound

The light can't be lost it donât fall in the evilâs hands
For so long is the time in which the knight fights for its safety
If a fire of death come now
It will only find a wall of ground

So the princes come from the sky to get the secret of the true light
Now the secret is hidden behind the illusion of a legend into the ground

Spirit of mountain take this treasure and guard it
The Secret will be secured for all the time into your hands
If a wind of death comes now
It will only find a hollow sound

And the mountain becomes the new guardian of sacred true
Into the underworld is safe from all of you
If a fire of death come now
It only will find a wall of ground

So the princes come from the sky to get the secret of the true light
Now the secret is hidden behind the illusion of a legend into the ground
