In this night
My spirit run on the road
Together my car and without you
I feel my thought running toward of me
To tell me my lifeâs history

For a moment
I have remembered all my life
Now Iâm free to run toward the light
Now Iâm free to run toward the light
Now Iâll able to be the king of the night

The dream is real
The power is in my veins
I leave fire on the road
My speed is as light
Iâll break the wall of the sound
This will be my triumph in the night

For a moment
I have remembered all my life
Now Iâm free to run toward the light
Now Iâm free to run toward the light
Now Iâll able to be the king of the night

Iâm king of the night
Iâll rule my life
