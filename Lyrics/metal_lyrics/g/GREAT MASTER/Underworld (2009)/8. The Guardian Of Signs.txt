I have read the book of truth
Where a great secret is written in its pages
I read so many lines and I found
Magical signs that stroke my eyes

As an ancient scroll is burning in my hands
The book disappears as its own defence
These lost words will last very long
Guarded by the guardian of signs

A secret that only one man can understand
Because itâs meaning is so great to be enclosed
He is the keeper of the magic key
Nine are the signs that protect the thing

As an ancient scroll is burning in my hands
The book disappears as its own defence
These lost words will last very long
Guarded by the guardian of signs

My mission is to keep the rule of signs
As in my lifetime Iâll respect the gift of the gods
Only one man one day will be so lucky
To receive this knowledge from my hands

As an ancient scroll is burning in my hands
The book disappears as its own defence
These lost words will last very long
Guarded by the guardian of signs
