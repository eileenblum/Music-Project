Remember the glory of heroes tonight
The heroic sound of the blade on the ground
Sons of the gods or protectors of the land
I am the observer and I read all the story through the men

Magic is the night spent in town
But fear is near, the false cross run
As a dragon burn everyone
The only escape is the battle or underwoldâs roads

Iâve seen the heroes
Ride against the winds of the dark
fire will burn our spirits tonight
But in the time the victory will come

As a flash of light was the battle day
To the sound of gates of the gloryâs way
And the holy knights ride toward the sun
And the holy knights as heroes will come
Tonight! Now their will come!!

They crave the treasure to blind the truth
With satanic smile they invade the land of the south
Leaving deseases, suffering and kill
They march on the land but the holy secret is gone

Iâve seen the heroes
Ride against the winds of the dark
fire will burn our spirits tonight
But in the time the victory will come

As a flash of light was the battle day
To the sound of gates of the gloryâs way
And the holy knights ride toward the sun
And the holy knights as heroes will come
Tonight! Now their will come!!
