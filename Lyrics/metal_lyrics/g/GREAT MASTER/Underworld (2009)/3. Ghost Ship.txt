In the darkness of the night
In the sea of legend
When silence breaks time
This is the calling of pain

You donât know You canât see
You donât feel its cold hand
the wind calls/brings the dark fog
To obscure the light

and to bring the cold fear of the night
through the screams they can feel pain and crying

Your travel is dangerous
You are walking toward death
The ghost ship is waiting
calling any name

You canât run you canât escape
You can only scream
Your prayer is useless
With death you cannot speak

And this meeting has signed your life
Thereâs not future you were born to die

Scream for me man of the sea
There is the ghost ship
In this day youâre my prize
You must be ready to die
Prisoner of your faith
Youâve passed the gate
With no friendly farewell
Your soul is ready for hell

Forever this story
Will be sung on the sea
The sailors will remember
the adversity of their friend

You canât run you canât escape
You can only scream
Your prayer is useless
With death you cannot speak

And this meeting has signed your life
Thereâs not future you were born to die

Scream for me man of the sea
There is the ghost ship
In this day youâre my prize
You must be ready to die
Prisoner of your faith
Youâve passed the gate
With no friendly farewell
Your soul is ready for hell
