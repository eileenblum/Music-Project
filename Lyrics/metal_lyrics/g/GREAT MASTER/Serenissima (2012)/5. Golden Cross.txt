Ten coins for the island of Zara
Ten coins for the glorious Venetian fleet
Ten coins for a new world

So came the siege and the fall of Zara
The blade of hate strucks strong against all the knights
This is not the will of God
Repent!

Alexis, it's time to keep the promises
You must pay us for your found throne
Riders will not stop without prize

Houses burn in the flames
No honor no mercy
Take the cross from devil's hands
sell your soul

Living hell for 14 days
Without rules in the town
Sings the bitch in the house of god
For a golden cross

You must run to save your life in this burning hell
The hand of fear is just behind you
Don't look back for the coming of the lady in black

Houses burn in the flames
No honor no mercy
Take the cross from devil's hands
sell your soul

Living hell for 14 days
Without rules in the town
Sings the bitch in the house of god
For a golden cross
