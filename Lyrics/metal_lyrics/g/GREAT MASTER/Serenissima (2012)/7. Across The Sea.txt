Live this heart running through the sea
Silence is break only by the waves
We travel towards the sun, where it go down
Day by day we come back to our home again

Across the sea so far away
Remaining a dream in every day
Across the sea so far away
Infinity is hard to comprehend

Magic lights shining in the night
When the stars lead us on the road
When the wind blows so hard weâll fly through these waves
On these waves weâll dance with this song once again

Across the sea so far away
Remaining a dream in every day
Across the sea so far away
Infinity is hard to comprehend
