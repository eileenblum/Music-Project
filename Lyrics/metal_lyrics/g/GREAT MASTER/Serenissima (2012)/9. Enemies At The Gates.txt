Lightnings of fire in the sea
From eastern lands
The beginning of the battle of the proud
Genoa began its march to conquer the sea
Burning and killing in 1372

With the help of the empire
the theft is done
the path now leads to war
With this improper act You sign your fatal fate
Gather all your troops it's time to go

My Enemies are at the gates
We have to run for the last chance
So we'll be the wall to defend the town
My enemies will not pass


No good news is coming from the fleet
Ships are burning for a hard and fast blow
We have to run to fight this desperate siege
We'll be ready for the battle in the night

Our four-thousand men are marching to war
And Zeno strikes with his blow
Cannons are striking men are fighting
For a single goal
win with a heart bold

My Enemies are at the gates
We have to run for the last chance
So we'll be the wall to defend the town
My enemies will not pass

No peace and no truce for the affront the peace is die
Rich and poor are fighting for their life
Triple chains are ready to close the way
And the cannons are armed and hot to fire

Free is the captain who leads us to the stone
18 ships from the east have joined to blow
Hard is the sound when the stone is struck
Every defense disappears in a cloud of dust


The sound of drums will be heard for a long time
Genoa is defeated and the death is cast
Enemies flee and retreat by the line
Many shouts of joy echo from men

The Doge is triumphant to the entrance in the square
Together with the great commander by his side
All the lost possessions were conquered in the sea
Peace came only after a great victory

Once again we maintain our power rule
Hail to our Lord
Captain Vettor now is ready for another run
Raising the lion's flag

My Enemies are at the gates
We have to run for the last chance
So we'll be the wall to defend the town
My enemies will not pass
