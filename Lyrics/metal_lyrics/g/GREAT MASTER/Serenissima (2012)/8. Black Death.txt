Quiet like breath it came from east
The human eye can not see its powerful fist

Slowly the ship brought us a kiss of death
Thousands of people are marked by its plan

Now where you gonna go?
The silent hand is just behind you
There is no way to escape from this plague

No hope no weapons to try the fight
People are affected by the cut of its scythe

Every place is burned by its touch
Black is the sign that it leaves as such

Now where you gonna go?
The silent hand is just behind you
There is no way to escape from this plague

Oh God please deliver us
From this infernal plague
Oh God please deliver us
We pray for your divine sign
