The saint army run trought the sea
To stop the advance of the Turkish fleet
The only hope is victory

The Pope launches his blessing on
All of the people, fight for God!
The wind is now on our side

Kneeling down I prayed God
Together with all my men
To grant us the victory in this day

Blood and tears
The silence now is near
Around the battlefield
There are hundreds of ships

Dark and cold
The line before of the storm
Beyond it there is the fall
We have not to cross

The Lion's ships open the dance
Shooting with cannons destroy the head
The battle of the Lepanto begins

Turks displaced by Christian power
Looking for the flagship to end the match
But venice masters make the wall

Don John calls loud the charge
Doria comes back face to face
The Lightning is ready to hit with its last shot

Strong and fast this is a sea of death
The horn sounds the last assault
It strikes with angry like a storm

Waterfall of steel and lead to close
The way of safety we are so close to win
