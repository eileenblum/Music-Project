From the burnt ashes of the Roman Empire where peace was cracked
She burn with the escape from the hard barbarian attacks

Many people built they house in a magic place encircled and protected
By Neptune's waters like a wall of stones

When a ring is dropped into the sea and gone
There's a path through the sea and this great town

There is a magic town on the sea
The Republic of freedom is the land of the free
Sheâs Queen of the sea and Venice is your name
With a golden lion as the symbol of your reign
Queen of the sea

Like a god of waters she has the control of the Italian seas and in this way
She leads the trade with the rich orient 

Many sails are ready for every battle with her arsenal thereâs not obstacles
Closed is the book when she goes to war

And the sail went near the holy land
To free the body of saint Marc for our name

There is a magic town on the sea
The Republic of freedom is the land of the free
Sheâs Queen of the sea and Venice is your name
With a golden lion as the symbol of your reign
Queen of the sea

The Queen of the sea
Reigns in the Middle age
On her flag there's as lion, symbol of an free reign
With powerful Sails
She rides the waves of the Sea
Taking Honour pride and glory
For her legendary domain
