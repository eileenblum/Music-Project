In a cold cell thinking of my life
Writing memories of magic east

Leaving from my town
Walking the long silk road
Iâve passed many stranger countries

Travelling in my journey
I have see illusion and reality
Mile after mile
Iâve touched the creation of God

Long in time is the road that leads me
To live all my dreams in a magic and distant land
climbing mountains, hills, plains and desert places
I came to know a golden land in the far east
Its magical dream

Learning a new life I built my way
To trade and to speak with a new world

Eighteen years are gone I am back to home
Then in the war I was taken prisoner

Travelling in my journey
I have see illusion and reality
Mile after mile
Iâve touched the creation of God

Long in time is the road that leads me
To live all my dreams in a magic and distant land
climbing mountains, hills, plains and desert places
I came to know a golden land in the far east
Its magical dream
