Ready for the glory and for the fight
Against the fire we ride
Covered with blood and steel for our pride
We take the winds of doom on our side

High horns play for the lion's heart
Strong is the blow that strike to the start
Defences are ready along the line
the fear of the roar will show you its shine

Riding in the wind side by side
For the lion's glory through time
Taking the way in the plain now we can
We are marching on the northern land


Holy is the road that leads to God
As sacred is the path to protect the weak
Freedom is a treasure that must be defended
Epic is the sound that will praise our deeds

Strong is the wind that come from the sea
To rule on all these lands and to bring the gain
Power and mighty come from our claws
Now waves the lionâs flag from these high walls

Riding in the wind side by side
For the lion's glory thought the time
Taking the way in the plain now we can
We are marching on the northern land
