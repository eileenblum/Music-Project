The Travel ended
on the Orient Sea
Where my heart must learn the law of the jungle

Run for the best
For any chance
my eyes only see the gold in my hands

The moon is the light of my return
For golden roads
I wait for the prize of all my jobs
Because I'm the merchant of the sea

Fight every day
Against the time
For a new deal
In every place

The rich orient
gave me great life
Made of power and comfort
I'm a lord

The moon is the light of my return
through golden roads
I wait for the prize for all my jobs
Because I'm the merchant of the sea
