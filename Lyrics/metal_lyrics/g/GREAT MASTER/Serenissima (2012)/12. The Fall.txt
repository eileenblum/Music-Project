Many troops ride
The northern lands
Defenses are weak
The end is near

Shady deals broken pacts
Do we have a chance?
The enemyâs army
Is marching off to war

Calling his name St. Mark
Lives again after the fall
Facing his fate there will
Be glory and the story will never ends

Council met today
Surrender or fight?
Cannons fire again
Maybe for the last time

Voices of conspiracies
Of a French attack
Tonight weâre not even
Safe in our beds

Calling his name St. Mark
Lives again after the fall
Facing his fate there will
Be glory and the story will never ends
