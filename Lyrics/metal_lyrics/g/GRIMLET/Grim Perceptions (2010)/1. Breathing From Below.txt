Born from the womb
You still can't walk but must reach for the moon
Suckle up dreams
Visions of futures they've never foreseen
Grasp for a hold
Either fall back or take the path of the bold
Quick to catch on
No meat for the weak so take it from dawn

Deep down emotions are staged â Internal masks
The keys to my existence â Tormented thoughts

Hideous breed, so full of hate
Despise myselfâ¦ excruciate
Wasted life, why shall I wait?
Breathe from below...annihilate

You still can't walk but must reach for the moon
Suckle up dreams
Visions of futures they've never foreseen
Grasp for a hold
Either fall back or take the path of the bold
Quick to catch on
No meat for the weak so take it from dawn

Sailing my thoughts into oblivion
On a sea of grief that's not my own
What wired sorrow is this I feel?
The body so light, the brain like steel

BELOW!

Bring forth the overwhelming deviltry
Growing out from the evil in me

No regrets; do what you're told
Run away, life uncontrolled
In your mind your fate is whole
Impersonate, act out... barren soul!

Gone, a thread of smoke I became
Folded the hand with a perfect game
Lost in the deep, no air to breathe
Feels like I'm drowning, I've been deceived

Hideous breed, so full of hate â hate
Despise myselfâ¦excruciate â hate
Wasted life, why shall I wait? â hate
Breathe from below...annihilate
