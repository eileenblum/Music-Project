Sail ho me you squiffy men
Belay those ropesâ¦pull them sails
Those ain't no brethren of the coast
Thar be no slouching whilst ye raise

Avast yer bilgin', prepare to overhaul
Man the rigging you bunch a scallywags
Hoist the anchor; I feel the glint of gold
Can't you smell the bounty, me filthy swabs!?

Scourge of the seven seas!

And so they set on another hunt
With thirst for gold, the thrill of the kill
Hoisting the colors with a scurvy grin
Feeding the cannons, blazing away
After the boarding, a slashing fest
In pools of blood they gather their loot

Chest full, our purse, be stronger
Fetch the den past blue yonder

My going back again
Is like walking the plank
Rather die than live
Surrounded by filth
Bound to a fate I chose
My cursed life as a thief
I guess I'd rather drown
Than dance the hempen jig
My trade over my doubt
No prey, no pay, no way
Been measured for me chains
Shrug off and grab a draught

Voice in his head
Faces of dead
Sweat down his back
Stare to the black
Ghosts on the mast
Soar down attack

Sail ho me you squiffy men
Belay those ropesâ¦pull them sails
Those ain't no brethren of the coast
Thar be no slouching whilst ye raise

Lost core, steal more, thieving to save my hide
Sail off, bring down, conform or get marooned
One day I'll die, forgotten buckaneer
Never escapeâ¦ entrapped in the den of the dogs

Again they set on another hunt
With thirst for gold, the thrill of the kill
Hoisting the colors with a scurvy grin
Feeding the cannons, blazing away
'Cos dead men tell no tales!
