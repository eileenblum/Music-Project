No, this time they wonât hold me
They canât keep me locked away
Dehumanized
To never find a âwhyâ
And keep me in a lie, NO!

Then you realize
That you need to compromise
Mesmerized
Eyes open wide
But still kept blind! 

Turn back! 
May find a way around the corner
No time to stop, canât feel, go under
When you say that now you got it
They make you start againâ¦NOâ¦NO!

The prize was sweet, the catch was simple: 
âCome on, weâll free you from the pain.
Surrender your thoughts and ambitions
Your life will never be the same!â

Where? I canât see. 
Walls aheadâ¦
feed off
my own insanity

Sucked in - Stripped out
Never go back - Nor break out

Slow!
To and fro where do I go?
Why?
Canât I leave this place behind?
Never give up
Forever run from closing walls
And then kneel down and comply!

Now I believe, a web made of ignorance
Must I submit? Or just lie down and die?

Blocked by the blinding light
Bring on the promised sight
Caught by your wheel
I run alone, my fate is sealed

Yes! 
Iâm hereâ¦
Theyâve let me find the door
Now, I won
Iâve broken through the maze
Yes, 
Heâs there
Weâve let him find a door
Now reset (the game)
And start again
