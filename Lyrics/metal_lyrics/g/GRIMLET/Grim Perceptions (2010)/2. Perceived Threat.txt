They want to make my mind so void
I will not be their human android

Life on the run since the night has fought the sun
Their prying eyes when I sleep I hear my cries
Won't get my soul no and that they can't control
No one can see but my freedom lies in me

Inhale man-made air
Poisoned to hypnotize
Obeying everywhere,
Exhale smiling lies

Life on the run since the night has fought the sun
Their prying eyes when I sleep I hear my cries
Won't get my soul no and that they can't control
No one can see but my freedom lies in me

Can't I go?! Where can I go?

Fell on the ground! Foam in the mouth!
Gasping for air! No way to shout!
My trembling hands! Stiff like a corpseâ¦a cramp in my heartâ¦

Fell on the ground! Foam in the mouth!
Gasping for air! No way to shout!
My trembling hands! Stiff like a corpseâ¦a tear in my heartâ¦

I see no way out! Only shit!
Peace is just a fraudâ¦ commit!
We are all but cheapâ¦toys!
Let the game go onâ¦

On and on till death's sweet songâ¦Perceived threat goes on!

There is no safe place, see it all, hear it all
In a world of lenses, in a sea of bugs
Deserts of independent characters on display
Self determination through plug-and-play lies

On and on till death's sweet songâ¦Perceived threat goes on!

â¦a cramp in my heartâ¦
Fell on the ground! Foam in the mouth!
Gasping for air! No way to shout!
My trembling hands! Stiff like a corpseâ¦a tear in my heartâ¦
