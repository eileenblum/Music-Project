Welcome to this frantic world of addicts, doped up slaves and servants of greedâ¦ pain breeding painâ¦ Leaking away from your shivers of fear!
Voting for void, praying for naught... Blind leading the blindâ¦ they cannot see what lies ahead when the sunlight has faded and the moonlight is dead!

Chaoscope!
Disordered state of embryonic nothingness
Chaoscope!
Lethargic dream of imposed knowledge

The mind remains delicately suspended on the matter and infinite space supposed to have existed before the ordered universe as the self leaps from the dynamical system that has a sensitive dependence on its initial conditions into an orderly and obedient state of being

Now you must step to accept all the past behind you, breaking the boundaries of what you've been through locked up inside of you.
From the needle to the bottle you face a disconnected legacy you will never see an end to this savagery

Keep on reaching for some sanityâ¦pain breeding painâ¦
Tweaking away on a sleepless leerâ¦going insaneâ¦
Minds entwinedâ¦Leaving behind the human me...

Chaoscope!
Disordered state of embryonic nothingness
Chaoscope!
Lethargic dream of mandatory blindness
