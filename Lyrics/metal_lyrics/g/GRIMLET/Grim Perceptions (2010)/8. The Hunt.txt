Die!

 âO joy! O glee! Itâs time! Faster â¦
Go through the dead, do the bidding of our Masterâ¦â

âO joy! O glee! Itâs time! Faster â¦â
Voices in my head they sing it for their masterâ¦

I see! They come! I hear their growls
Dancing while they do the harvest of the souls

âWeâll die together!â was the lie that they pinned on me
Taking lives seeking the âTruthâ.
Seeking their Truthâ¦

The putrid smell of flesh and gutted viscera
Blood soaks the battlefield
The wrath of angry crows picking on eerie bones
Paces their grim taskâ¦the demonsâ hunt!

My lifeâs gone! I donât wanna die!
EGH!!! 
âLook at this one! Heâs about to dieâ¦Nowâ

Take your last breath 
Hoping for a Garden of delight
Gasp your last sigh
Itâs your soul that we will demonise
Let your ghost arise

You will obey and dance with us
Together weâll fight to conquer and destroy
Your death begins
Just spin and sing, do the demonsâ dance!

âO joy! O glee! Itâs time! Faster â¦
Go through the dead, do the bidding of our Masterâ¦â

âO joy! O glee! Itâs time! Faster â¦
Sing it with me so we will rejoin our Masterâ¦â

âFall back! Join us! Itâs now! In lineâ¦
Learn quick and then chant the song we call divineâ

âWeâll die together!â was the lie that they pinned on me
Taking lives seeking the âTruthâ.
Seeking their Truthâ¦

The putrid smell of flesh and gutted viscera
Blood soaks the battlefield
The wrath of angry crows picking on eerie bones
Paces our grand task while the demons hunt!

âAnd thus my work growsâ¦â

Agh! Ugh! Egh! Agh! Ugh! Egh! No!

Fall back!
Join us!
Behold the gaze of a demonâs face

Itâs now!
In line!
As the bodies fall, the flames will take their place

Fall back!
Join us!
Bow down!

Sure as the dark follows the dance of the burning star
Ripâ¦cutâ¦go fulfil my bid!
â¦and the demons hunt!
