All of you who don't believe, your fate I now conceive
Deluge of deathâ¦ Can't you respect me?!
The one who learned from hate, that life can suffocate
Rage of painâ¦Can't you respect me?!
You go about your life, all set to be demised
Deliveranceâ¦Can't you respect me?!
No more lies! No more light! Face your doomâ¦You will respect me!

My plan is now devised, they will call it suicide
Flash of flamesâ¦Can't you respect me?!
Pool of blood! Heap of flesh! Face your doomâ¦You will respect me!

Sinister dance, dusk of war - Dawn of tears, burning corpses

When I push the trigger, life will cease to be
A raging ball of fire, no time to plea
As I go off I'll become
What you came to fear

Squeal in awe, this time the plan has got no flaw
All the news will speak of me and how I came to be a soldier and a "Martyr of the Lord"
No, the truth they will not see, it's just a killing spree. I'll never be ignored!

Damage done! No way you'll get to Heaven. No, you won't enjoy eternal bliss
Life is gone! Splattered around in chunks of meat recognized by the record of your teeth

All of those who don't believe, their fate I now conceive
Deluge of deathâ¦Can't you respect me?!
The one who learned from hate, that life can suffocate
Rage of painâ¦Can't you respect me?!
All those liesâ¦Realizeâ¦Was sold out!?â¦You did not respect me?!
Squirt of blood from my chest. It's my doom. The sniper saw meâ¦

My dance with death, dusk of war - Dawn of tears, my bleeding carcass

You think you've won but I grip the switch...Blood shot eyes!
