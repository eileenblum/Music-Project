Grind!?

Soulless breed of screeching body, steel apocalypse that crawls with nowhere to escape from the lifeless beast that comes alive through the killing madness of puppet-like men.

So many dead, so little time
The waltz of fire in those dying eyes
A bloodbath of bodies 
Scratch from inside my mind

Monster roar of bursting shells
Those who ride in guts of hell
Soldier boy look what youâve done
Grinding people, Satanâs fun

Mutual assured destruction
Under the dead shine of stars

Iron Machine-Tormentor
The land bleeds from open scars

Feel the beast grind

[Solo]

So many dead in so little time
The twister of some mad demon child
Cruel breed intruder
Rules from inside my mind

Monster roar of bursting shells
Those who ride in guts of hell

Grind!
