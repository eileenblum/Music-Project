Hello let me introduce to you 
I am the daemon who lives, who lives inside you! 
Beneath your flesh Iâm chewing your bone 
Making you do things youâll regret 
When youâre all alone 

Youâll be my arms; Iâll be your will 
Axe blunt, eager to kill 
Their life is a light, a light you shall steal 
Their blood for your gloryâ¦ 
Ainât this a good deal?! 

Ohâ¦Ohâ¦Ohâ¦Die! Ohâ¦Ohâ¦Ohâ¦Die! 

The fight of fights, to control your mind! 

Come, take this journey with me 
Leave your soul and fly away 
Release the wrath you carry within 
Knee-deepâ¦in the dead! 

Arm Off, Eye Out - Eviscerate! 
Rip Tong, Crush Chest, Twist Blade â Now Mutilate! 
Enlarge your death rate 

Break Skull, Smash Face â Then amputate! 
Wrench Neck, Cut Head, Stab Heart â It is your fate! 
Enlarge your death rate 

Good Boy! Obey my ruleâ¦Dae 
You fool! Deathâs song for youâ¦mon 

DIE!!! 

Come forth, hell bastard, unleash your dark desire! 
Come forth, hell bastard. I unleash my dark desireâ¦ 

Good Boy! Obey my ruleâ¦Dae 
You fool! Deathâs song for youâ¦mon 

The fight of fights, inside your mind!

Beneath your flesh Iâm chewi	ng your bone 
Making you do things youâll regret
