12 bell strokes at midnight rumble, 
The moon has risen, the sun has tumbled. 
Through the walls of my castle they appear, 
With smiles my vampires arrived to me. 

Releasing laughs while they reveal your secrets, 
That cradles your sleep, your stupefied dreams. 

Endless night, 
Endless life... 

I hear the rain falling down, as the storm is in front of me, 
She's rumbling her killing screams they echo in my mind. 
Then listens to my chant of pain and soon you'll be unborn. 

I run alone go through the corridors of loneliness 
Her ghost flies me away in her tormented crystal cloak. 

Outside the wolves howl, owls peep, the lizards crawl. 

Endless night, 
Endless life... 

The fog dissipates when it feels the warm breeze, 
Soon a new day will rise and slowly the castle disappears. 

Endless night, 
Endless lie...
