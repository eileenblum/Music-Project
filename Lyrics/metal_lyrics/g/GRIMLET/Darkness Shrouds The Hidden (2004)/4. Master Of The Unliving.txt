There by the shore of the water, they are toiling 
Building those shrines for the godsâ¦ So mortal 

Goâ¦ 

Oh! All the power and gold, may control them all 
Die! Not a single pyramid will save you from the rule 
...Of the Jackal! 

Fight me, never will you deceive me 
Your putrid flesh will feed me 
Iâll rip away your soulâ¦ 
I amâ¦ 

Annubis! 

Youâll never cross the sea of souls, nor reach the bliss it holds 
Iâll take you to the world beyond 
Stab, with your blade and your staff â over the heads of the poor 
Who build those shrines for you, who starve and die for you 
Ra is fading out! 

Invading, stealing, raping, hurting, maiming, killingâ¦ 
Those slaves built your world I will destroy! 

Iâll spit away your soul 
All you did will bring your doom, feel my wrath while youâre 
Running, hiding, freezing 
Iâll spit away your soul 
I watch through your maze of stone, power overthrown, 
Dissected, desiccated, decomposed 

Youâll never cross the sea of souls, nor reach the bliss it holds 
Go below 

Kill all your wives â you think they go over with you 
Poison them all â youâre just a mummy you fool 

No matter how you try 
To cheat my claws and my reach, you cannot slip away...from me 
Because your life seeps away when you stare into the eyes of 

DEATH! Takes you over the Nile, to the land of the 
Dead! Bring my rule to all those who do not believe... 

Annubis! 

Fight me, never will you deceive me 
Your putrid flesh will feed me 
Iâll spit away your soulâ¦ 
I amâ¦ 

Annubis! Master of the Unliving... 
Go!!!
