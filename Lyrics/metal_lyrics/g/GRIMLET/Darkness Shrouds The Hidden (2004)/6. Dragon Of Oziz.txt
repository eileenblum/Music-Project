With a sword in my hand I enter the dragon's cave." 

[Dragon:]
I am the dragon of Oziz 
The guardian of the ancient circle of power 

[Narrator:]
Protecting the one who's dead 
Defying the living soul 

[Dragon:]
Who is this tin clad toddler? 
A sword against the raven throne!? 

[Knight:]
I am Bhrym 
Heir to the throne of the clan of Rask od GhaÅee 
My vow was to slay, kill a dragon and say: 
"Fear nevermore" 

[Narrator:]
Guardian of evil, becomes immortal 
Destiny's over, bringer of all the pain 

In this fight, when he struck so blind 
This fight when he turned 
His life into endless torture 

[Knight:]	I will end your hate! 
[Dragon:]	Can't you see my eyes?! 

[Narrator:]
Fool is he who doesn't see 
Truths beyond his own 
His was the fire of autistic greed 
That never dies or runs cold 

Blow; blow the simmering balls of flame 
Blow; blow the furious wrath of hate 

[Knight:]	Thou shall kill my kin no more! 
[Dragon:]	I never have, I never would! 
[Knight:]	I'll spill your blood on the floor! 

[Dragon:]
Your ancient father 
Who ruled this land 
Will lose his heir 
With his sword in his hand. 

[Knight:] So come on!
[Dragon:]	Wretch! Can't you respect me? 
[Knight:]	Why? 
[Dragon:] Don't you unlock the cage! 

And so blood flowed 
Land and skies turned cold 

[Narrator:]
(Foolish knight) opened the portal 
Destiny's over, our keeper has been slain 

In that night, with a moon so bright 
That night, when he broke 
The seal and set free all evil 

[Knight:]	Oh! What have I done?
[Daemon Ghuldar:] Look into my eyes!

[Narrator:]
Fool is he who doesn't see 
Truths beyond his own 
His was the fire of autistic greed 
That never dies or runs cold 

Blow; blow the simmering balls of flame 
Blow; blow the furious wrath of hate 

[Knight:]
I've killed the dragon of Oziz 
(The guardian of the ancient circle of power 
Releasing the one who was dead 
Condemning every living soul)
