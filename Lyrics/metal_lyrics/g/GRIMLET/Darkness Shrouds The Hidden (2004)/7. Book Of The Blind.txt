Riseâ¦ 

I can see what you see not, 
Milky vision, eyes rot, 
When you turn they will be gone 
Whispering their hidden song. 
Then you see what cannot be, 
Shadows move where light should be. 
Out of darkness, out of mind, 
Spellbound into the âbook of the blindââ¦ 

Gloryâ¦you think God spoke to you? 
I have a visionâ¦which has led you towards darkness 
My lordâ¦youâve entered the other side 
I can see you dead! 

And the curse fell upon the people 

Ohâ¦eternal and almighty church, 
Thought thou could ordain the whole creation? 
To control people, 
And feed off their minds! 

Darkness shrouds the hidden 
Eyes glowing unseen 
With only the sounds of razor claws, 
Scraping your soul from within! 
The prison for those so damned, 
Is called the âBook of the Blindâ, 
Which has made sightless all mankind! 

Caught in thy net of shadows 
What hast thou to show? 
Do you tread a golden heaven? 
Or worship âHimâ below? 

NO!!! 

I can see what you see not, 
Milky vision, eyes rot, 
When you turn they will be gone, 
Whispering their hidden song. 
Then you see what cannot be, 
Shadows move where light should be. 
Out of darkness, out of mind, 
Enthralled into the book of the blindâ¦ 

Come onâ¦Down! 

Come onâ¦Down!
