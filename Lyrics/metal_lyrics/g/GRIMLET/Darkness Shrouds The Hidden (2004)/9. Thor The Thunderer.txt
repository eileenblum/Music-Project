Here among the cold frozen lands 
I thank thee, oh eternal mighty Thor 
For this glory youâve sent me! 

Cry on, oh Vingi-Thor â with the dancing moonlight sword 
Cry on, oh Vingi-Thor â with the smitten shields of war 

Iâll chop them up, by the first light of the day 
I will smash their heads in! 
With so much blood upon my face, I will not see 
As they fall before me! 

Now, on this red tinted plane 
I fight to save my land and kin 
My swordâs not enough to win 
Help, almighty Thorâ¦ 
There is no tomorrow 

Thor with the fiery bent brow, 
Red beard, muttering low, 
Darting fierce lightning, eyeballs that glow 
Comes, while each chariot wheel 
Echoes its thunder peal 
As his dread hammer shocks 
Makes earth and heaven rock 

âI am the thunderer! Here in my Northland, 
My fastness and fortress rein I forever!â 

The snow floats, in the cold December winter 
Icy sticks cover the trees and rivers 
The beautiful nature that shrouds these Nordic tribes 
The battle sounds overwhelm the ancient rites! 

Now I chop another arm, a crimson dusk to end my day 
I like to smash their heads in! 
With so much blood upon my face, I now can see 
The Christians fall before me! 

So, on this red tinted plane 
I fought to save my land and kin 
My sword and Thorâs were enough to win 
Thank you, almighty Thorâ¦ 
They have no tomorrow 

âI am the thunderer! Here in my Northland, 
My fastness and fortress rein I forever!â 

As his dread hammer shocks 
Shout to Earth and Heavenâ¦ 
WAR!!... 

From the halls of heaven he rode away 
To Lidskialf and sat upon his throne, 
There on the mountain, from whence his eyes survey (the world)
He took his knife, and sat to eat alone 

Thor arose took his horse and set forth to rideâ¦
