Buy it new! Get it now!
Donât you snooze or youâll lose it,
How can you let this one go?
Donât you even say you donât know.

Be like this! Live like that!
Donât you think or youâll jinx it,
Why do you try to resist?
You know you gotta be on the list.

Take it in! Tweet it out!
Donât you fail or youâll sink it,
What will you do to survive?
Shallow smiles will keep you alive.

Go on nowâ¦The rules are down!

Roll the dice set to cheat
Place your bet, feed their greed
Bow down at their feet

Think youâve won?
When numb, regrets are none
You know that! Doubtless fool

Rotten grin
Your gold is made of tin!
But it shinesâ¦ Soâ¦ Damnâ¦ Muchâ¦

Buy it new! Get it now!
Donât you snooze or youâll lose it,
How can you let this one go?
Donât you even say you donât know.

Look at this! Got it there!
Donât you want one or face it,
Can you become just like me?
All good shit in life ainât for free.

Intrusion through illusion
Domain through focus deviation
Mindless obedience
Abide to the leechesâ exploitation

Roll the dice set to cheat
Place your bet, feed their greed
Bow down at their feet

Think youâve won?
When numb, regrets are none
You know that! Doubtless fool

Rotten grin
Your gold is made of tin!
But it shinesâ¦ Soâ¦ Damnâ¦ Muchâ¦

Even more! Higher now!
Donât you stop or youâll crash it,
Why? Have you just had enough? 
No one said it wouldnât be rough.

Canât stop now! Roll with it!
Donât you cringe or weâll end you,
Where do you think you can go?
Lost yourself a long time agoâ¦

Welcome to our world, though ever so high
Canât get thereâ¦ this is all part of the lie!
