Gazing at a slow moving clock I wait
Diseased into my expected obedience 
Life has been missed again and again
Acting, reacting, eager for some sort of lenience

Floods of tears, sorrows and screams â Pain and emptiness or so it seems
Mind filled with hate, coma for your eyes â Self-quarantine rationalizationâ¦dies

Live on hollow searches
Barren, shapeless urges
Dreaded eye that watches â Twisted evil scorches
Abstract faith, in a loserâs mind I still wait

Bound and gagged, this trap is an endless maze
Here in the dark, hoping for sun light that fails
The right moment, the right time, lost in a haze 
Stuck to my cross with rusted out nails

Floods of tears, sorrows and screams â Pain and emptiness or so it seems
Mind filled with hate, your lost in despair â Soul carving depressions evilâ¦stare

Speak of truth, honor and pride, live in deceit, contempt and lies
Dream of glory, bow and awe, waking up to gut - wrenching hate
(The clock ticks, I sigh and it tocks
My mouth speaks through what my will just blocks) 

â¦bleed bastard, bleedâ¦
The clown in the mirror keeps on grinning at you
Bound to a will of power a cold silence follows you

(Wishing)
Wish I had knownâ¦ Wish I had thought
(Wishing)
Wish I had laughedâ¦ Ripping the plot

â¦bleed bastard, bleedâ¦
The clown in the mirror keeps is grin on you
Bound to a will of power a cold silence follows you

Live on hollow searches
Barren, shapeless urges
Dreaded eye that watches â Twisted evil scorches
Abstract faith, in a loserâs mind I still wait
