Hello let me introduce to you
I am the daemon who lives, who lives inside you!
Beneath your flesh Iâm chewing your bone
Making you do things youâll regret
When youâre all alone

Youâll be my arms; Iâll be your will
Axe blunt, eager to kill
Their life is a light, a light you shall steal
Their blood for your gloryâ¦
Ainât this a good deal?!

The fight of fights, to control your mind!

Come, take this journey with me
Leave your soul and fly away
Release the wrath you carry within
Knee-deepâ¦in the dead!

Arm Off, Eye Out - Eviscerate!
Rip Tong, Crush Chest, Twist Blade â Now Mutilate!
Enlarge your death rate

Break Skull, Smash Face â Then amputate!
Wrench Neck, Cut Head, Stab Heart â It is your fate!
Enlarge your death rate

Good Boy! Obey my rule
You fool! Deathâs song for you

Gripping the dead you take for me
Slashing away their last breath killing spree
And when youâre done hoping for release
Iâll stab your gut you scream âOh master, please!â

Good Boy! Obey my rule
You fool! Deathâs song for you

The fight of fights, inside your mind!

Hello, nice talking with you
I am the daemon who lives, who lives inside you!
Beneath your flesh Iâm chewing your bone
Making you do things youâll regret
When I leave you alone!

Thouâ¦Shallâ¦DIE!!!
