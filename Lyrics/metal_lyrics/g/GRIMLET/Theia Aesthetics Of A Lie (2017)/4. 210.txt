Got so good at hiding shudders
What is true in the eyes of others?
Ever looking for a cause
What is now but never was

Disputed truth sold so cheap
A petty fool, a sage, a creep
Folded in two to be straight
Cheating away to be great
Never less thought wanting more
Torn apart after beforeâ¦

Fall in; stay sin
Mock up; grieve not
Eat up; donât plot
Get off; be downâ¦ Keep your ass on the ground!

Must dig deep on how to be shallow, gagging on shit before you swallow!
Learn to conform to this life of sin, pray to some god and show off a grin 

Fall in; stay sin
Mock up; grieve not
Eat up; donât plot
Get off; be downâ¦ Keep your ass on the ground!

Sacrificial lambs of holy income
Got to make it more and then some
Beneficial mind suck shows on T.V.
Ought to think before find the key

Got so good at hiding shudders
What is true in the eyes of others?
Ever looking for a cause
What is now but never was

Disputed truth sold so cheap
A petty fool, a sage, a creep
Torn apart after beforeâ¦ after before!

Bow down!
Donât look up you faceless smut
Make way!
Bend your knees and keep your mouth shut
Kneel down!
Cannot think of the self you shed
Obey!
Pull their rope until youâre fuckingâ¦ deadâ¦ fucking dead!

Bow down!
Feel your sweat inside the box
Make way!
Blood dripping on the rocks
Kneel down!
Eyes closed donât look ahead
Obey!
Can you cope until your fuckingâ¦ deadâ¦ fucking dead!

Must dig deep on how to be shallow, gagging on shit before you swallow!
Learn to conform to this life of sin, pray to some god and show off a grin 

Fall in; stay sin
Mock up; grieve not
Eat up; donât plot
Get off; be downâ¦ Keep your ass on the ground!

Lies!
