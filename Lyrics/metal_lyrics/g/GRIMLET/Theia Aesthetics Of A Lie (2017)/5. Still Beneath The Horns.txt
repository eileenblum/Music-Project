âUpon my flesh I lay my lifelong anguishâ

No future in the past
No hope whatever lasts
No grasping and no hold
No believing whatâs been told
Fooled by choiceâ¦if you must
Wronged in placing down your trust
What it was and now itâs not
Got so good before it rot
Preyed on what you had
Tried their best to make you mad
Pat your backâ¦gave you a bone
Turn around and youâre alone
Looking up from the pit
Raising slowly bit by bit
They couldnât break the bond
Still there is a light beyond

Down for anything or nothing at all
Reason runs thin up to the curtain call
Gave up âcos I can in order to feel
So to live again itâs me I had to kill

No master or no boss 
Somehow it all became a cross
No strength to carry on 
My will had long been gone
When the we became a me
And the rules closed off the free
Then they lay down their plot
I took my guns and then I shotâ¦

Then and now donât know how
Itâs just the art of faking it
Can it be? Iâm not me
Simple as that, or maybe
What they say goes away
Why donât they keep their mouth shut?
If they knew what is true,
Would they still have what it takes?

Down for anything or nothing at all
Reason runs thin up to the curtain call
Gave up âcos I can in order to feel
So to live again itâs me I had toâ¦

Killâ¦ Killâ¦ Killâ¦ Kill!

Down for anything or nothing at all
Reason runs thin up to the curtain call
Gave up âcos I can in order to feel
So to live again itâs me I had to kill

To survive
Shrug it off and be alive
Life before was endless torture

â¦set on breathing and survive
Shrug it off and be alive
Could I get my hardest closure?

Then and now donât know how
Itâs just the art of faking it
Can it be? Iâm not me
Simple as that, or maybe
What they say has gone away
They could not keep their mouth shut!
They never knewâ¦

The stronger you push, the harder it breaks!
