a sliver of star dances through my sky to crash into another lifetime always the journey never the destination those lovely columns of fanged smoke wander through plastic gardens where kisses blown at a forgotten love still drift looking for a face in a world of masks I see a light on a dead horizon glowing like a bed of sapphires in a sea of ash but it's a distraction and nothing more just an instrument to measure the darkness that swallows me from time to time
