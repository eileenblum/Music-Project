with better eyes I could have seen the disgust on your face when I spoke your name and with better ears I could have heard the disgust in your voice when you spoke mine and with better hands I could have felt your skin crawl when my fingers touched down upon your neck and with a better nose I could have smelled the vomit churning in your stomach when you touched me out of pity and perhaps with a better voice my words might have done more than flatter and yet even with all these things I know it would have happened the same way because even now I still wish I could do it all over again
