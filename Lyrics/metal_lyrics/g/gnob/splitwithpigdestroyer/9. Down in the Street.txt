[Stooges cover]

Huh!
down on the street
where the faces shine.
floatin' around I'm
a real low mind.
see a pretty thing - ain't no wall.
see a pretty thing - ain't no wall.
no wall,
no wall,
no wall.
Uuh!
yeah deep in the night
I'm lost in love.
yeah deep in the night
I'm lost in love.
a thousand lights
look at you.
a thousand lights
look at you.
I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost - yeah.
Huh
faces shine - real low mind.
real low mind.
I'm a real low mind.
real low mind
