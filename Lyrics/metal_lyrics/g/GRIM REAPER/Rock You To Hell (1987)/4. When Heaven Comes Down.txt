When heaven comes down, look out

They say I'm a loser, and it's tearing me apart,
But I'll show them they're wrong, and believe me I don't fool around
One thing you can bet on is I ain't losing heart,
I'm a fighter, and a fighter like me don't stay down

They'll live to regret it, 'cause my time is coming soon
Don't ask me why but I can feel it in my bones
And when my time comes, I'll be barking at the moon
And then my enemies should never walk alone

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
When heaven comes down, when heaven comes down, look out

All it took was some bad luck, and my friends all let me down,
They lied and they cheated, and took me for a fool
Now I don't trust nobody, and I don't want you around
I'm determined to win, and the winner takes it all

They'll live to regret it, 'cause my time is coming soon
Don't ask me why but I can feel it in my bones
And when my time comes, I'll be barking at the moon
And then my enemies should never walk alone

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
When heaven comes down, when heaven comes down,
When heaven comes down, don't be around

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
