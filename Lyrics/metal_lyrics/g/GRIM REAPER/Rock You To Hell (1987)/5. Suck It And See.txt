This lady in black came to me and she said,
Would you like to come home to my room?
I resisted all temptation, but I took her invitation,
I hope that she don't make me fall too soon

She said "Suck it and see"
It was all new to me,
All in a young child's dream
She said "Suck it and see"
Can't be happening to me,
But it's good if you know what I mean
Suck it and see

I'm lying in her arms, taking all her charms,
She took my heart and burned it to the core,
Taking all she could teach, 'cause it was in my reach,
I just wanted more and more and more

She said "Suck it and see"
It was all new to me,
All in a young child's dream
She said "Suck it and see"
Can't be happening to me,
But it's good if you know what I mean
Suck it and see

She said "Suck it and see"
It was all new to me,
All in a young child's dream
She said "Suck it and see"
Can't be happening to me,
But it's good if you know what I mean
Suck it and see
