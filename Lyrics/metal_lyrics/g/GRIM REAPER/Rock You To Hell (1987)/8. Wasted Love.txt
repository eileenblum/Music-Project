I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you took my heart away
Wasted Love - return it back some day
Wasted Love

I'm tired of waiting for you to make up your mind,
You're sitting pretty with your friends from the city,
I'm leaving you behind
But you've got what you wanted, I've gotta find what I need,
No lies, no alibis, for someone to believe

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love

I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
