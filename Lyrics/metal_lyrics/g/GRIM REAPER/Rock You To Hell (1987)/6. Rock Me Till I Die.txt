Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die

It's a feeling that I have for music,
It makes me wanna listen every day,
I hope that I will never ever lose it,
That would be a heavy price to pay

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die

If they ever try and take it from me,
I will fight them 'till my dying day,
I know they'll never ever beat me,
I will fight them each and every way

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock me now
All night long
'Till I die

If you wanna rock then follow me,
'Cause that's the way it has to be
We've gotta rock and roll each day,
I don't care what the censors say

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die
Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die
