Hey you, Yeah you. Come here,
You gotta problem? Have now, ha

If you're coming to get me, make sure that it's your day,
'Cause if you're not feeling lucky, then pain's the price you'll pay,
If you ever deceive me that's the last thing you'll ever do,
Then I'll come and I'll get you, and they'll never find out who

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

I'm as quick as a rattler, and deadlier than any snake,
And if you talk behind my back then your back's gonna break,
Don't go looking for trouble, it always seems to find me,
I don't know why it happens, but that's the way it seems to be

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

If you wanna fight let's make it now and do it right,
Out on the street in the heat, you're down tonight,
In the neon light prepare to fight, with saving grace,

As I've proved so many times, no one will take my place

Streetwise or not, your time will come to pass one day,
It's the bitter price you will always have to pay
So come on now, or just get out of my sight,
'Cause if you don't, boy, then tonight won't be your night, no way

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
