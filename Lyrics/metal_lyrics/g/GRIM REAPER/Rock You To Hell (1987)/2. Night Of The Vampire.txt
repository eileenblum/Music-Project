If you think you're safe at midnight,
That's the last thing you could do,
He'll be looking for that nighttime bite,
He could be coming after you

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire

Look away from his hypnotic eyes,
Or he will put you in a spell
No one hears your last pathetic cries,
Now you live eternal hell

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire

Beware, beware

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
