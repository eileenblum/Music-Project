I left the city for another life, to start it all again,
All I wanted was the solitude, and time to think alone

Peace and quiet seemed the only way, but I guess that
I was wrong,
Now I stand, with gun in hand, I should have known it all along

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

Lust for freedom

I'm imprisoned, shut out from life, but I know it won't be long,
There ain't no way they can keep me in, I will show them that they're wrong,
The lust for freedom will see me through, until I break the chain,
You will never get a second chance, you won't mess with me again

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

I've had enough, ain't taking no more,
The time has come to break the law,
If I give in I'll never get out,
So I must stand, I'm breaking out

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

Lust for freedom
