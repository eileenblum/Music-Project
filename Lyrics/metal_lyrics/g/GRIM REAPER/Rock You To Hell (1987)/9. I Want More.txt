Late at night I'm haunted with visions from the past,
They bring back painful memories, how long will they last?
You said you'd always be there, but I fought it on my own,
I guess you made my mind up, 'cause now I walk alone

The bubble's burst, the dream lies broken,
And now I'm out here facing life alone
I guess you took my love for granted,
And now it's turned my broken heart to stone

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more

Reoccuring nightmare that always come around,
I never will forgive you, you know you let me down,
I lie awake and wonder if I should take the blame,
But it won't make no difference, we'll never be the same

The bubble's burst, the dream lies broken,
And now I'm out here facing life alone
I guess you took my love for granted,
And now it's turned my broken heart to stone

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more
