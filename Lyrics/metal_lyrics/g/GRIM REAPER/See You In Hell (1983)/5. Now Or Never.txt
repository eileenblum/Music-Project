Let's Go!!!!

It's always the same, you know I will follow
I'm taking the blame, cause it will end in sorrow
I couldn't see, that it would have to end this way
I'm not prepared, to meet the passion or the pain

So I made up my mind, taking it now or never
Cruel to be kind, making it now or never
I'm leaving today, making it now or never,
Better this way, now or never.
Now or Never.

This moment in love, it ain't a game I want to play
I like to be free, so I can face another way
It ain't such a dream, cause I can't take it any time
If that's such a scene, honey that's no crime.

So I made up my mind, taking it now or never
Cruel to be kind, making it now or never
I'm leaving today, making it now or never,
Better this way, now or never.
Now or Never.

So I made up my mind, taking it now or never
Cruel to be kind, making it now or never
I'm leaving today, making it now or never,
Better this way, now or never.
Now or Never.
