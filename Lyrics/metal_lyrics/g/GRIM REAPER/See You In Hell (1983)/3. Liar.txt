Liar, Liar, Liar, Liar.

I'd never thought I'd find a woman like her,
Who could satisfy my needs,
She got just about everything,
Satisfaction guaranteed.

Then one day I hear from my friends
You've been cheatin' behind my back
All the times you said your gonna make it
Just to keep me off the track
Then one day she finally broke the news
She decided to tell me straight
Could I take her back, could I forgive
But I told her it's too late

Liar, Liar, Liar, Liar.

Thought she was perfection in every way
She was one to please
Then things changed, anyone could tell
It was there plain to see

Then one day I hear from my friends
You've been cheatin' behind my back
All the times you said your gonna make it
Just to keep me off the track
Then one day she finally broke the news
She decided to tell me straight
Could I take her back, could I forgive
But I told her it's too late

LIAR!!!!
