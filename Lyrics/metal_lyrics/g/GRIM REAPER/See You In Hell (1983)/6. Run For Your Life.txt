I see them coming over mountains,
Marching in line,
Children playing by the fountains,
Gods of war making time,
See the swords glisten in sunshine,
When they come to an end,
Alright all of our kin folk,
We will have to defend.

Run, run for your life, their coming now
Run, run for your life, their coming over
Run, run for your life, their coming now
Run, run for your life, RUN!!

And now they've got us surrounded,
From the hills to the trees,
This time they've got us surrounded,
We're like glades in the breeze,
Get all the women and children.
To hide underground,
Don't move, don't even count,
And don't make a sound.

Run, run for your life, their coming now
Run, run for your life, their coming over
Run, run for your life, their coming now
Run, run for your life, RUN!!

Dragons are slaying, and the people are praying
Hoping it will come to an end,
The sword and the flame, the reflection of pain
And no time to stand and defend,
Steel crossing steel, thrashing wheel,
Now with the power and might,
We know it's alright, stand and unite,
This time we're ready to fight.

And now the battle is over,
Count the cost,
Move the dead, clean up the debris,
So we see what we've lost,
Get all the women and children,
From underground,
Thank God they never moved,
and dared make a sound.

Run, run for your life, their coming now
Run, run for your life, their coming over
Run, run for your life, their coming now
Run, run for your life, RUN!!

Run, run, run for your life,
Run, run, run, run for your life
Run, run, run, RUN!!!!
