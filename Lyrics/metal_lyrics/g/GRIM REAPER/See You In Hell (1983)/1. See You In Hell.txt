See you in hell!!!

can I make you an offer
you can't refuse

I kept my eyes on you
cause I tell you that you lose

and you can come with me
to a place you'll know so well

and I will take you
to the very gates of hell

[Chorus:]
See you in hell my friend
See you in hell my friend
See you in hell my friend
I'll see you in hell!!!

Your choice's up then
how many sins can be yours

at my kingdom final choice
is yours!

you can take it
any time that you need

next thing I'll borrow
all you've got to do is bleed

[Chorus]

[Interlude:]
Come with me, I will take you down
to the very depths of your soul
and I'll make you burn!!!

See you...see you in hell!!!
See you...see you in hell!!!

See you in hell!!!

can I make you an offer
you can't refuse

I kept my eyes on you
cause I tell you that you lose

and you can come with me
to a place you'll know so well

like I told you
at the very gates of hell

[Chorus]
