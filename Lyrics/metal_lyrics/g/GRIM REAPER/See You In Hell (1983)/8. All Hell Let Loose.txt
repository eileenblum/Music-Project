When the night closes in,
and the dark shadows fall,
That's where it starts again,
evil making it's call,
To someone who sits unaware,
could it be you I'd beware,
There's footsteps behind you,
Your at the scene of its lair.

Imagination burns,
All hell let loose, all hell let loose,
Try to shake the image from your mind,
All hell let loose, all hell let loose,
Imagination burns,
All hell let loose, all hell let loose.

A flash of light begins a thunder in the sky,
Thoughts of terror that will come to you and I,
But don't give in with, try with all your might,
Won't give up without a fight,
When you wake in the morning,
You should be alright,
But evil awaits you,
To take you back into the night.

Imagination burns,
All hell let loose, all hell let loose,
Try to shake the image from your mind,
All hell let loose, all hell let loose,

All hell let loose, all hell let loose
All hell let loose, all hell let loose
All hell let loose, hell let loose
Hell let loose

I'm coming to get you
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
