I'll tell you a tale, of someone I know
Now he's gone, there's nothing to show
Made the headlines, for that one time
The burst of shadow, and on it's way it died.

Dead on Arrival, there's no hope in hell
Dead on Arrival, how can they tell
Dead on Arrival, ain't it a shame
Dead on Arrival, we'll never be the same

Live your life to the full, never see shame,
Speeding on that motor, when your inside a game,
Dead in an instant, watch out real good,
Bleeding everything, ain't gonna look good.

Dead on Arrival, there's no hope in hell
Dead on Arrival, how can they tell
Dead on Arrival, ain't it a shame
Dead on Arrival, we'll never be the same

Dead on Arrival, D.O.A.

Dead on Arrival, there's no hope in hell
Dead on Arrival, how can they tell
Dead on Arrival, ain't it a shame
Dead on Arrival, we'll never be the same

So I pick up the paper, read it once more
I turn all white again, I guess I was making sure
So in tears it lies, I look to the skies
I'm standing at the grave site, to say my last good-byes.

Dead on Arrival, there's no hope in hell
Dead on Arrival, how can they tell
Dead on Arrival, ain't it a shame
Dead on Arrival, we'll never be the same

Dead on Arrival, there's no hope in hell
Dead on Arrival, how can they tell
Dead on Arrival, ain't it a shame
Dead on Arrival, D.O.A.
