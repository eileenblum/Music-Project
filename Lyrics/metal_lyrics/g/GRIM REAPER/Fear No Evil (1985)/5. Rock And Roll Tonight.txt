Come on now let's get it on
Give a helping hand to the band
Get down to the front shake your head
And clap your hands to the band
'Cause it's alright, it's alright

We're playing rock and roll tonight
Play loud and playing hot
Playing all night and we'll never stop
Playing all night we'll never stop
Playing rock and roll tonight

First you get it a solid wall of air
Let it go mama, let it go like you just don't care
'Cause it's alright, it's alright

Red hot rock and roll
