I am the darkest night
And I defy the light of day
I swallow every shadow whole
And capture every ray of sunshine
That slips through my cloak
And tries to shine a light
I am the lord of evil
And the night my power and might

The lord of darkness
I cast a spell
I am the darkness
Your living hell

I steal your sight and then
I let the dark souls out to play
See the things you cannot see
By the light of day
I am no fool although I know
That you cannot see
If asked who took your life away
Just answer it was me

The lord of darkness
I cast a spell
I am the darkness
Your living hell

A light is falling
It's found a crack
Oh hear me calling
I'll be back
