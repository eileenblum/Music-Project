Look out when the lightning strikes
Fear will take you when it likes
When it's coming just for you
Plays upon your darkest fears
You'll never know when it appears
When it's coming just for you

Come on take my hand
And at my command
You will fear no evil
Come on take my hand
And at my command
You will fear no evil

It's a force you cannot see
Gives you false security
But it's coming just for you
It comes to you in the dark
At the sign the wolf will bark
And you know it's come for you
