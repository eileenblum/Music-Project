I'm going crazy just sitting around
My mind is racing I don't hear a sound
People talkin' at me makin' me mad
Tonight's the night and it's gonna be bad

I always said
It's just a matter of time
I always said
It's just a matter of time

People on the streets are running for their life
The flame of gunfire flashes like a knife
I feel the pain a sudden warming glow
Will I survive tell me I don't know

I always said
It's just a matter of time
I always said
It's just a matter of time

I feel my pulse fade away
As I lay dying, won't see another day
I'll take ten men with me to the grave
My hopeless soul they tried but couldn't save

I always said
It's just a matter of time
I always said
It's just a matter of time
