Twelve o'clock and the hour's here
It's the time we've all come to fear
Spells are cast and the dead will rise
Haunting night time to claim their prize

And now you're final screams
Become reality not dreams

As the mists of the night time spread
Filling millions full of dread
Watching out for the vampire's bite
Or the wolf that preys in the night
