I want to know how you feel
'Cause I can't take it no more
Hurt me too many times
Like you did before
Now I'm changing my ways
Time I let you go
Shedding too many tears
I'm gonna let my anger show

I've got to pull myself together
Ain't got much time
Got to get myself together
And lay it, lay it on the line

I must have been blind
To miss what was going on
Took me for a fool
I thought I was wrong
Then you let yourself down
Showed your colours true
It was all a mistake
And now I'm leaving you
