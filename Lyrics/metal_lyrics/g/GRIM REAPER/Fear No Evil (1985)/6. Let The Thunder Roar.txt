The stage is set the time is right
To let it go tonight
The crowd is here and begin to cheer
Rushing to the light
Hands are raised and light a blaze
The band begins to fire
Taking us, making us
Reach for something higher

Let the thunder roar begin
To save us all
Let the thunder roar begin
To one and all

Lights will flash, cymbals crash
Like they've never done before
Chords are played, guitars are slayed
As we let the thunder roar
Don't forget, you can bet
We'll be back again
To strike the chords to the hoards
We'll be back again
