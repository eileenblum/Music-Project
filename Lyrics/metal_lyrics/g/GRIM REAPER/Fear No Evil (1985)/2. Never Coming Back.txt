I couldn't believe when you turned around to me
And told me what you had done
You tricked me, told me more of your lies
You lead me on and I thought it was good
All you friends were talking at me
I said you fools but I was the one
So I'm getting up and going from here
Just like I knew you would

And I'm never coming back
I'm leaving here for sure
And I'm never coming back
I'm leaving here for sure

Now what's done is done
Don't come crawling to me
I've had enough
Live your life on your own
You took my love and threw it around you
Drained me of all that I had
Now we won't try it again
I think it's left well alone
Now I hope you're satisfied
You blew it away
Oh baby it's so good

And I'm never coming back
I'm leaving here for sure
And I'm never coming back
I'm leaving here for sure
