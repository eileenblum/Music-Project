When daylight's gone, the beauty's still left
Preserved for eternity, by the love of the night

A sunset of embre, a rose in the sky
Kiss of the sungod, farewell to the world
The skies are ablaze, with the loss of the day
And will be again, til' the morning has come

Bring on the night, its beauty in black
Enchanted mistress, I'm held onto its grip
Days of darkness, soon to arrive
Blessed to the beauty of the sunkissed land

When daylight's gone....

Daybreak is here, setting fire to the world
Caressing the soil, giving life with its touch
Those of the daylight, awaken again
Singing their praises, to the safety of light
