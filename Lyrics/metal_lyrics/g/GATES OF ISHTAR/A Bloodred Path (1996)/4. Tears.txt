As I tear the blindfold from my eyes
I can see that my fears were not born from a dream
From the touch of wings my tears turns red
And like a withering flower my life ends

I scream in pain, but my soul is burning to ashes
I dream again, But my eyes are sleeping forever

As the tears runs red down over my face
I remember the light of the dawn on my bed
But my eyes are forever dreaming in red
And my tears will not ever extinguish the flames

I scream again, but my soul is burning to ashes
I dream in pain, but my tears are falling forever

In my eyes burns the flames of the dreaming souls
And in my heart burns the candle, The blackest of fear
Why can't I watch the dawn once again?
To live in eternal dusk is my deepest fear
