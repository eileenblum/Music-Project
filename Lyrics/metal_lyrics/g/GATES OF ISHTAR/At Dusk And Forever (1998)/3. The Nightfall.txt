Dusk, embrace me, enter the kingdom of light
Night, surround me, cover the sky with your might
Thunder, caress me, slap my face with delight
Storm, revocate me, as I scream in your eye
As I scream in your eye, revocate me!
Come, join me, enter domains of night
Lust and pain, taste the devils vine
Thunder, caress me, slap my face with delight
Storm, revocate me, as I scream in your eye
When you call upon me, with a voice of sorrow and tears
I'll be there to guide you, through the dusk and nightfall...
Now the time has come, join my kingdom, taste the vine
Feel the might of eternal nightfall !
Now the time has come, join my kingdom, taste the vine
Solitude in eternal nighfall !
