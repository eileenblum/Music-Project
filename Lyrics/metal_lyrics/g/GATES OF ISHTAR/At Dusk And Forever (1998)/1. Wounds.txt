Time, What is time?, the tale of pain and death, those moments of our lives
Pain never dies, you only suffer more when death stares into your eyes
Wounds never heal, the scars are there to stay as the memory remains
Lost never found, your soul is led astray when your body fades away
Never the same again, scarred by the years of pain
Never the fool again, scarred by the years of pain
To be dead is to always live in their memories
and walk alone on the path of grief
To be dead is to always scream at the silence
forever trapped in a place of pain
Pain, what is pain?, the tales are the pain, the moments never die
Dead are the lies, the truth is here to stay as the liars fades away
Lost, never found, souls are led astray, their words to be slain
Pain never dies, you only suffer more when death stares into your eyes
