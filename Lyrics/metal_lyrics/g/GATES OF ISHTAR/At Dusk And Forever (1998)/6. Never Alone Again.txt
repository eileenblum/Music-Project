View my secrets, crawl inside, taste and feel all my pain
Stand beside me all for one, never leave me again
Help me find the truth beyond, words buried by dust
Open up the slanderer's den, tear and slaughter their lies
Come with me, take my hand
far away from the promised land
Face your fears, as one we stand
never alone again
Close the chapters and set things straight, fools guided by christ
Cross our path and you're bound to die, come, join us tonight
Tear your blindfold, cleanse your mind, lost, setting the way
Find the one of darkness spawned, kill, enlightened assay...
