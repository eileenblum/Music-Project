Follow me to the place eternal, full of pain, pleasure and sin
Come with me to a place nocturnal...
After dawn there's an open gateway, to the place beyond and far
After light comes the dusk forever, ripping chains tears your soul apart
At dusk and forever - eternal pain in the darkest of domains
At dusk and forever - after dawn only shadows remains
Walk with me through the darkest wastelands, where nothing grows but your own fear
Come with me into oblivion...
After dawn there's an open gateway, to the place beyond and far
Follow me into oblivion, through the gates of pain and grief...
