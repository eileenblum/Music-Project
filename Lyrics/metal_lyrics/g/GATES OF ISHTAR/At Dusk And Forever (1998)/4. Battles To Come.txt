When the night is there to stay
after daylight has faded away
On a path blacked by pain
I'm waiting for battles to come
When the moon is cold and pale
and the forest whispers my name
I?m cold but warmed by faith
that you?ll join me, and. . .
Ride with me tonight !
Guide me through the battles with glory and pride
Stand by me tonight !
Raise your sword and join me in battle with light
When we've slaughtered the fools of light
we shall tear down the portals of might
When their lies are dead and destroyed
we shall build up our kingdom once more
When your sword no longer shines
and your armor is covered with blood
You'll be king until the day
when I call you to. . .
