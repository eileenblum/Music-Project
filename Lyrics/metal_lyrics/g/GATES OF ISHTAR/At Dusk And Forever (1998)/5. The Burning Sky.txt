Words, never thought for a long time
never spoken, crawling in my mind
Brought to life by their own demise, their feeble lies
I remember those days when truth were the way
Remember those days, it's never the same again
Hate, I feel the demon growing strong inside
and vengeance is screaming in my blood
Like thunder roaring in the sky
the burning sky. . .
