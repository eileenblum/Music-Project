Adrift in ocean
Embraced by silence
Blinded by black veils I stare into the abyss

Dissolved in water
My essence is eternal
The mortal shape is sinking
Slowly it's drowning

Lost in a no man's land
Time and space are meaningless
I'm stuck between nothing and the eternity
Floating on the blackest night
I will reach my redemption
Above the sky of the eternal light

Death is freezing
My flesh and blood
I am at peace now pain is over

My last glimmer of consciousness
Seems like a never ending farewell
I yearn for a sleep but the curtain is not coming down yet

A new void
A new grief
In absence of life
Slaughtered by the claws of nothingness
