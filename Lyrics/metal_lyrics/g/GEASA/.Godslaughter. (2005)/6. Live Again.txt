The waters of sleep wash over me
Tranquil and cleansing.
As I began to live lost.
In the midst of time.
In the midst of time.

I have been beyond the light
My soul cries out pain.
A need far greater than this life
Of stagnant fucking shame
Come rapture and come loss,
Lend thy hands with fate and endless time.
Cover my soul with skin;
Let me live again.

The waters of sleep wash over me
Tranquil and cleansing.
As I began to live lost.
In the midst of time.
In the midst of time.
Let me live again.
