Sacred chants of old,
Lead me to this realm.
A fortune of cruel fate,
I am the damned.
Walk the path, never see,
Blind eyes open, to immortality.

Souls in torment,
At my command,
Leave me to this world;
Their time is at hand.
Walk the path, never see, blind eyes open, to immortality.

Destroy, all of our fucking lost lives.
Punish, all of our fucking lost lives.
Destroy, all of our fucking lost lives.

Oh god I love this slaughter,
I revel in this mire.
I walk the path of torment
I feel the death I am.
Oh god I love this slaughter, wage war.
I walk the path of torment
I feel the death I am.

Oh god I bleed tomorrow, waging war.
I walk the path of sorrow,
I feel the death I am.
Oh god I love this slaughter
I feel the blood in my veins.
I walk the path of torment
I feel the death I am.

Oh god I love this slaughter,
Black eyes staring back at me.
I walk the path of torment
I feel the death I am.
Walk the path of but never see
Blind eyes to immortality.
