War
We are gods.
With hate in our hearts
We stand before they throne.
We are the rebel scum
Of your forgotten world.
With strength titan like, we touch the sky.
A plague of consciousness
Brings the souls that defy.
We won't bow or follow.
The dream is ours.
We stand an army, strong against you gods.
Our lust for life our pain and hate
Is united beyond thy lights reach.
With strength titan like, we touch the sky.
A plague of consciousness
Brings the souls that defy
Godslaughter
Godslaughter
Gods of this world are dying alone.
We stand before three
Out swords are legion we are
Godslaughter.
Gods of this world are dying alone.
We stand before three with the power of the sky.
We fight with the power of the sun.
We win with the world at our feet.
Our souls are tainted with darkness,
We are godslaughter.
