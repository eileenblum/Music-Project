Chaos, bring me feeling,
Crushing cold, my thoughts like death,
Let me rest in peace.
Father, can you feel it?
Hateful, cold, my thoughts like death
Now you rest in peace.
Death is an answer. Reach for endless time.
Chaos bring me feeling
Crushing cold, my thoughts like death,
Let me rest in peace
Father, can you feel it?
Hateful cold my thoughts like death
Now you rest in peace
