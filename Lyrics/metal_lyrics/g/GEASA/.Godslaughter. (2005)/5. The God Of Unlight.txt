Wake in twilight and still I long to be.
Wake to total darkness, but still I long to be.
Have you seen me, in the passing night?
Have you felt a chill running down your spine?
Have you been alone and scared?
When I'm there.
The cold touch of air,
Drags me forth from shadow.
Where I sleep. It's time to die again.
I am the god of unlight.
I am the tear falling from your eyes.
I am pain and I am hate.
I'm you're god. You believe. It's you're fate.
Where is this place? It's so cold
I can't tear my eyes away.
I can't tear my eyes away.
You want fucking cold? Come live where I am.
In this, this cold lost forgotten world.
The cold touch of air, drags me forth from shadow.
Where I sleep. It's time to die again.
Have you seen me, in the passing night?
Have you felt a chill running down your spine?
Have you been alone and scared?
When I'm there.
