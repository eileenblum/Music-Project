Wake in the total night,
Wake in cold sweat,
Try to cling on, to this world,
That I've seen this dead vision
That I will be this dead vision
Pray for one last wish, before you die,
Pray for new hope, under ebon skies,
Mighty hordes that follow,
Side by side they stand.

Pray for no tomorrow, this day is mine.
Great legions of sorrow,
Side by side they stand.
Pray for no tomorrow,
Still times shifting sands.

Grey, in perfect silence
Beneath the blaze,
Of this, of this sunless day.
No tomorrow
Tears fall slowly, at the end of time.
But I have seen a dead vision.
Tears fall slowly, at the end of time.
But I have seen a dead vision.
A dead vision.
