Weary I wander nevermore.
My essence.
Beneath waves of twilight.
This blessed isle is forsaken.
This sweet gale my final memory.
Fallen from grave.

Weary I wander forevermore.
My essence, beneath waves of twilight.
This blessed isle is forsaken.
This sweet gale my final memory.
Fallen from grace.

A frostbitten sunset, embraces me.
Demon desires.
Warm me to this night
Worlds, worlds, worlds,
Within this fragile shell.
This blessed isle is forsaken.
This sweet gale my final memory.
Fallen from grace.

This blessed isle is forsaken
This sweet gale my final memory.
Fallen from grace.
This blessed isle forsaken.
This sweet gale my final memory.
Fallen from grace.
