Born of fire are we.
We live in eternity.
Soft skin?
All I see before me is meat.

Born of fire are we,
And forever be.
Soft skin?
Come rot in my arms
For you're suffered beliefs.

Where do I know you from?
You are the whore that I love.
You are the first.
You are the last.

You are the whore that I love.
And when I wake before the dawn.
All that I can say,
All that I can do is.
Fuck you.
Escape from the whores embrace.

Where have you been
Before claws into my mind?
What can you believe of our,
Our infamous times?

Where have you been
Before claws into my mind?
Infamous world is ours
And I'll never believe.

Never to be seen as,
What I'll never be.
I'll never be meat for the,
Meat for the grand whore.
