A sigh, for lost times, and it builds in me,
Builds in me forever
And it seems, I will never be free, of dead memories.
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me from the seas.
Of, of, of my fucking misery.
Leave me be, leave me be, leave me be in the seas
Of, of, of all my twisted dreams.
A sigh, for lost times, and it builds in me,
Builds in me forever,
And it seems, I will never be free, of dead memories.
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me from the seas.
Of, of, of my fucking misery.
Leave me be, leave me be, leave me be in the seas
Of, of, of all my twisted dreams.
Fall down, on the Earth, you rotting corpses.
Rest well, in the seas of your misery.
And it grows deafening.
The sound of your twisted screams.
Fall down, on the Earth, you rotting corpses.
Rest well, in the seas of your misery.
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me from the seas.
Of, of, of my fucking misery.
Leave me be, leave me be, leave me be in the seas
Of, of, of all my twisted dreams.
A sigh, for lost times, and it builds in me,
Builds in me forever
And it seems, I will never be free, of dead memories.
Rescue me, rescue me, rescue me from the seas.
Of, of, of my fucking misery.
Leave me be, leave me be, leave me be in the seas
Of, of, of all my twisted dreams.
A sigh, for lost times, and it builds in me,
Builds in me forever,
I've never been so alone; I am real.
