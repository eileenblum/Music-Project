Farewell this cruel world
I leave the oaths of fate,
And through it all I crawl into the sun.
Farewell all craven love,
I fuck thy soul with hate.
I turn around and I spit in your face.
My back is turned, on this stagnant world.
As I crawl into the sun.
Farewell this cruel world.
I leave the paths of fate.
I crawl through the night,
As the sun burns bright.
