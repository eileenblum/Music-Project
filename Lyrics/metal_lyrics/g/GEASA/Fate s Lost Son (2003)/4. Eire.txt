And as I lay my soul to rest,
I hear you calling.
And it is the saddest song of all,
The song of Eire.
Softly you cry, not a tear, not a tear in your eyes.
As the fire burns low, where shall we go now?
Rest now, oh formless one, your spirit in the sun.
Rest now, oh formless one, your spirit in the sun.
Wake now and seem, your children still fight.
Once we were strong,
but you raped our honour and our song.
Once we were free,
now were bound in chains of misery.
We are proud,
and our hearts have always been free.
Once we were strong,
but you raped our honour and our song.
Once we were free,
now were bound in chains of misery.
We are proud,
and our hearts have always been free.
Rest now, under the stars so bright,
Wake now and see, your children, we still fight.
