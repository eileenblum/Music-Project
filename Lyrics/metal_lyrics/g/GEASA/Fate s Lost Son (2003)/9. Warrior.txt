I shall no cry no more tears.
I have been dead for too long.
Sleeping with the earth,
Enchanted Neolithic years.
Deep with the earth,
Your blood on my hands.
Dead eyes locked in Wintermalice.
Endless years of shadow,
Drink my poisoned blood,
The crowning, of a genius god.
Iconoclasm my veins,
And my heart lies therein.
Awake like the stars,
Where the sea is at one with the sky.
Walking on crisp amber,
Where the wind whispers and enchants my nights.
My hands sink through your skin,
With eyes like nocturnal fires.
Fresh earth eager on wooden silk,
Thy eternal nightscape.
I shall cry no more tears.
I have been dead for too long.
Sleeping with the earth,
Enchanted Neolithic years.
There is life beneath the valleys of earth,
And there is a death above
