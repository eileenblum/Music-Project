I feel my life fly before me.
I feel my love wane.
I see my life grow dim.
Now I know.
I can see my rite of passage,
I know it is soon to begin.
My thoughts last for an age,
Oh, but it is beautiful transition.
Hate... to purify my heart.
Murder... to glorify my soul.
Magic... to honour my mind.
A journey length aeons told
To a crescendo, of moon music
Which bloodies my mind
A lifeless void...
... Old
