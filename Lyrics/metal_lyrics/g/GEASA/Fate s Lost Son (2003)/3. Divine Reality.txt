Before you say a word, Listen to a tale of woe.
Once there was a man, His heart of stone,
And in his eyes, not a shadow of hope,
Once cold night, he heard a calling,
To take him from his sleep.
And in a forest, he walked alone,
What he followed, his own black soul.
At what he saw, he stopped and stared,
He wept at his lost love standing there,
And she asked him, under the stars,
If he was ready, to take her in his arms.
He said.
What have I seen in the stars above us?
What do I know from the Earth below?
Relent. Let me go, and I will die in freezing cold.
Fuck our life, your love and fuck your rotten heart,
Shit. Fuck. Cunt. Bitch. I'll tear your soul apart.
Relent. Let me go, and I will die in freezing cold.
And the sun burns black. At the heart, of my storm.
Fuck our life, your love and fuck your rotten heart,
Shit. Fuck. Cunt. Bitch. I'll tear your soul apart.
Relent. Let me go, and I will die in freezing cold.
I fucked Jesus Christ. I told him of your sins.
I raped the virgin whore. She wants more and more.
Relent. Let me go, and I will die in freezing cold.
This fucking life, it feels like death.
This reality. Divine in your fucking eyes.
You'll never know, the hate, you have sown.
This fucking life, it feels like death.
This fucking life, it feels like death.
This reality. Divine in your fucking eyes.
