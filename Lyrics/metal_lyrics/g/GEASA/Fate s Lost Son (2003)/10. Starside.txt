To starside I fly
Soaring through a cloven sky
Striding towards a bloodies cross
Tasting the life of a Whispered agonies
Fucking the lifeless daughter of light
Hearing the screaming of souls
Upon the innocent fields of pity
Frozen hatred fills my mind
Through my eyes see...
A crimson sun falling towards a grey twilight
Silver branches webbing the night sky horizon
A sea of tears flowing towards
My frozen wastelands
Sorrows water pool about my feet
I am the silver sword of a fallen angel
I am the mist of the night
The pillars of heaven
crumble with my glance
Turning my gaze to immortality
Now the darkness greets me
All that I am and all that I shall be
(Glimpsed through shadows)
