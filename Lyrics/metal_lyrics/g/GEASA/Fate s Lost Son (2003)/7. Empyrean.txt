Come cast your shroud of light before me.
Beguile me with your tender kiss.
Skin as pale as snow with purest red lips.
In the midst of fresh earth,
Midnight...filling silver waves,
Breathing the air of Alien stars,
...My empress of silence.
Whispers eclipse the dawn.
My enchantress of the stars,
A land of the night.
Haunted by a frozen silence.
Awake like the moon in Midwinter's night.
Blind-fire-flashes blaze in my eyes.
Taken back to the stars from whence I came.
My fiery path etched in the night.
Breathing the air of Alien stars.
My enchanted starscape.
A land of the night.
Where my whispers eclipse the dawn.
