I have returned. From the dawn of time.
I have returned to claim, what was once mine.
And I'll purge, all light from your eyes.
My mind, is aglow, with crushing moonlight.
The mighty seas vent my rage.
Into the Eversea I fall from the night and I,
I never thought I'd be born again.
Fall from the night. Scream with me.
Rejoice, in eternity
The lightning cleaves the frozen skies,
Pure with, fingers of frost.
I now become the hate,
Anger of the shadowed mountainside.
Seething veiled forests of misery.
Rejoice, in eternity.
I have returned.
The night, I leave.
As the stars fall like leaves.
For we are courageous in the face of the death.
And we have seen, for a million years.
All of your dreams. All of your fucking fears.
We see, as you lie asleep.
Only dreams of heaven you keep.
