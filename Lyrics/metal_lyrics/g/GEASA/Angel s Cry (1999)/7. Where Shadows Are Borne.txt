Your shining light falls through
Your silver beauty is covered by
Your starlit eyes
I am dying
In your eyes
Bring to me sudden wisdom of ages
Being far are your wings of destiny
As wide are the seas of sorrow
I am drowning in despair
Being far are your wings of destiny
As wide are the seas of sorrow

Why have you crushed my life from within?
Misery, Thy master calls you, heed me
I feel the hammer fall like a moonlit caress

Hail to you my angel
Your broken wings hold me
Why must your smile cut me?
I bleed
I will take you where shadows are born

I feel the hammer fall like a moonlit caress

Hail to you my angel
Your broken wings hold
Why must your smile cut me?
I bleed
I will take you where shadows are born

In a world of mourning

By banished light, I pray my soul to take
And if I should die before I mourn
I pray the day my skin shall burn
In cold memories
In a world of mourning a shadow is borne
