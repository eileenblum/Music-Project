Daughter of Samael
Child of night
Come to me

Dance with me frozen queen

Wherefore art thou my frozen queen
A vanity never for my eyes to see
From the void where my thoughts are answered
Oh to dance with you my queen

Be still my ebon heart
Buried beneath the ashes of
A thousand broken dreams

Wherefore art thou my frozen queen
A vanity never for my eyes to see
From the void where my thoughts are answered
Oh to dance with you my queen

Through the night -- my queen
See what she did your cunting daughter

Daughter of Samael
Child of night
Come to me

Wherefore art thou my frozen queen
A vanity never for my eyes to see
From the void where my thoughts are answered
Why have you forsaken me?

Be still my ebon heart
Buried beneath the ashes of
A thousand broken dreams

Wherefore art thou my frozen queen
A vanity never for my eyes to see
From the void where my taughts are answered
Why have you forsaken me?

Die with me
Set me free

Oh for you my pale and innocent one
You will never have me
Oh to rape your secrets one by one
You have no secrets left to give
In loneliness and despair
Despair be my god
Oh to dance with you my Queen
I am lost in your eyes
