Bring me your tears
Grant me your sorrow
I can see no tomorrow
Dance with me dreamweaver
Darkness glory be
Within dream's kingdom
We are lost

Through this frozen nightmare I crawl
Within this filthy shell I mourn
Outside of this barren world I live
Tears of fire I weep forever more
Alone the last one on earth
Forever the first one to die
Alone the last one on earth
Forever the first one to die

Darkness glory by
All is dead
Within dream's kingdom
We are lost

My thoughts fly free above this realm of wonder
A silver forest, my black kingdom
Where I will be eternally, the last one on earth

Darkness glory be
Within dream's kingdom
We are lost forever

Through a pentagram etched in frozen immortal stars
Oh the lust of the night
Eternally the first one to die
Alone the last one on earth
