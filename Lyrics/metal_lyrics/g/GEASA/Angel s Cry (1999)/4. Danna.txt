Dannu your lonely son calls you
Hear my cries, I beg of you
Your fires burn low
Beneath the past I go
For you

You feel the pain a banished god knows
Your lonely son goes where
Where you may go
You feel the pain a banished god knows
Your lonely son goes where
Where you may go
You feel the pain a banished god knows
