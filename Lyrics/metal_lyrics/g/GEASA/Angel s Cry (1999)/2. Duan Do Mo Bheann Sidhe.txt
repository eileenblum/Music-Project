Magnificent woman of sorrow
Messenger of death
Inflictor of my pain
Be my bride in waiting

Appear to me in dream like vision
As spears of light drench the land
With your seducing songs of wile
Be my bride in waiting

Ancient rivers of death flow
Over the valleys of darkness
Grim life I bid thee farewell
For an bheansidhe
My bride to be

Now in caves of ever dark
Rivers run dry
Only tears of sorrow flow
Everywhere the stench of death
Grim life I bid thee farewell

For you my bride in waiting
Buiochas mo bheannsidhe

Misanthropic desires now enacted
In a place of ultimate tranquillity
Buiochas mo bheannsidhe
Where souls of loyalty
Bear the scars of baptismal sword
And forever be
Buiochas mo bheansidhe

Over the valleys of darkness
We fly
For you my bride
Grim life I bid thee farewell
For you my bride

Buiochas Bhean

Magnificent woman of sorrow
Messenger of death
Inflictor of my pain
Be my bride in waiting
Be my bride
(In a dreamlike vision as spears of light drench the land)
And forever be
Buiochas mo Bheansidhe
Misanthropic desires now enacted
In a place of ultimate tranquillity
And forever be
