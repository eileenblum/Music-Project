I feel my life fly before me
I feel my love wane
I see a future life
It grows darker still
And now I know
As never before...
I can see my rite of passage
And I know it's soon to begin

We are the endless...
We walk with the dawn of time
As there is none before
This path I mourn

A journey, length aeons told
This is my rite of passage
A journey, length aeons told
To a crescendo of moon music
Which bloodies my mind
A lifeless void old
When will it ever end?
