Buried alive in a blood fueled casket
surrounded by satanic soil
short of breath, encountering death
drowning in blood, veins torn open
six feet under, there's no escape, rotting away slowly
Maggots impaled piercing the flesh
Maggots impaled they'll be your death
Maggots impaled eating your eyes
Maggots impaled digesting your soul
