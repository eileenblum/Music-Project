Pieces &amp; bits remain of the dead reversed cross
through their hearts impaled
slowly dying, no help from your god
worthless bible drenched in blood
with a blasphemic soul &amp; hammer death is carried out through me
crushing skulls, the holy one's are left with carnage on their shoulders
Crushing Skulls on the Holy Ones
pieces &amp; bits remain of the dead reversed cross
through their hearts impaled
slowly dying, no help from your god
worthless bible drenched in blood
CRUSHING SKULLS ON THE HOLY ONES
