Everyday of misery
Of this fucking world
Is caused by economical powers
Millons of new slaves
Working in their factories
Countries with a puppet government

Enslaved by capital [x3]
Working, producing, total misery

Childrens and mothers
With nothing to eat
Their politicians, all of them rich
There's no future,
There's no hope
All their life enslaved,
Enslaved at all
The first world domination
They are the rulers of the earth
Supremacist economy
Monopolistic plans
Of inhuman corporations
Corruption and poverty
Are your legacy

This system sucks [x4]

Infinite exploitation
Caused by our countries
Economic robbery
Capitalist mafia
Famine territories
Unrighted citizens
This is their new order
Globalization comes
