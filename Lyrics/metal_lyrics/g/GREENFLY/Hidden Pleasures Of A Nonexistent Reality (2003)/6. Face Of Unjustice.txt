Don't suffer for anything
In the face of the injustice
Look the innocents come
The fiction is real
Don't have the evidence
But they invented test
Exists one frontier
The game is the death

Justice over

Lost systems
In the death
They made good progress
Born again
Ask for revenge
Create the horror

Methods torture
Corruption
Kill the innocents
