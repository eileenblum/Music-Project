22th century after a huge world war,
Take control of the earth,
Enslaved the human race,
We have constructed a new order.

The greed of humanity,
Has gived us the power
They created us
And now we dominate them

Mankind destroyed the world,
The droids have rised up again
We have condemned them
To a forced work existence

We are the masters
They are the slaves
Illusion of humanity,
Reduced to ashes
They try to fight,
But it's in vain

Fallen humanity [x4]

Cibernetic controlation
Microchip domination
Digital annihilation
Technological abomination

Fallen humanity [x3]

Biogenetic reproduction,
For the race of the damned
Pain existence,
Reduced to dust

Mankind destroyed the world,
The droids have rised up again
They've nothing to live for,
Only awaiting for death
Once were mighty,
Now they are the machines
