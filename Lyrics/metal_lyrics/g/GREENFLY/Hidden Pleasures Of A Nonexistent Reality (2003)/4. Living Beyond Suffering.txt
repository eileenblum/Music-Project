Lost looks that are hidding stories
Closed mouths demand revenge
Her whole body was heart
Her hate belongs to one first name
Brave pig, brave kid

Turning love into nightmare
Too much blood
Her pride cries of love

One night her pride exploted
Stayed up all night
Bloodstained hands
Beheaded and mutilated
The nightmare will never be repeated
Years of love,
Years of threat

They were subjected
To physical and verbal abuse
A new life begins
Without his cowardly
Her sons will see the light
No fools will stop them
Her dreams will come true
Their lives will be changed

Turning love into nightmare
Too much blood
Her pride cries of love

Turning love into nightmare
Her pride demands revenge
Fear in blood
Falling in a new attack
Your end is your own dead
