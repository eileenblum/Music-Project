Your stupid way of life
You're trying to impose
Thinking for our minds
Who do you think you are?

Years of pain,
Of death, and persecutions
Burn in hell, you say,
And we don't care
Why do we have to obey
All the lies that you tell?

Can't you see that your time is near extinction?
We prefer to think for ourselves
We don't need your words,
Which are full of blood

Moralistic terror
Centuries of pain
Religion is an error
Your saints died in vain
Catholics are denied
And vatican fools
The pope stinks

Forever I'll be
Forever we'll be
Forever I'll be
Crossbreaker

Your empire is falling
Now you are afraid
Maybe a divine punishment
From the people you've killed

Crossbreaker I'll be
Crossbreaker we'll be
Crossbreaker we are
