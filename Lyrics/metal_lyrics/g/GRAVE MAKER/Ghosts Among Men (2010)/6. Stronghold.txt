No second chances! Fighting my demons day by day, all the pain I've caused! Run away! When I was gone, my family never spoke my name. Never forget those times, Just try to forget that state of mind or cruel world. You tried to get the best of me. It used to be a countdown to my life, As I was told the consequences of my mistakes. Grew up running city to city, Told I'd never see the age of nineteen. At the time, I accepted. But here I am, I'm still alive counting up. This is my pledge to life, Examples set from the friends I've lost. No second chances! I can't let this life pass by!
