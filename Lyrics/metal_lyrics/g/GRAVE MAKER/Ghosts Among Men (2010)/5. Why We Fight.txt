Bonded by frustration, Binded through all the bullshit life keeps throwin' at us I know out there, there is something more for me! This thing of ours, in my life it's all I need We're bonded by frustration We're binded through all the bullshit life keeps throwin' at us No matter where I go, a thousand miles from home, These familiar faces, familiar faces, Give me a place to finally be myself! I know out there, there is something more for me! This thing of ours, in my life it's all I need From east to west, why we fight! Whether lost in a crowd, or all alone by myself. I'll keep screaming till the fucking end: UNITE AND CONQUER!
