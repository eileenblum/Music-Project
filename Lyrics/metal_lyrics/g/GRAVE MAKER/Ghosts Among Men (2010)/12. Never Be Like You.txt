Do you fear to be alone? Is that why you never leave home? Your life is slippin' away, And I'm sliding with it. You build, DEDICATE Your life to the most depressing shit. You build, DEDICATE Your life to the most depressing shit. As we all sit back, We watch you build. We watch you break. Devotion crumbles. Unstable wreck. Gone too far, no coming back. I hope this shit was worth it. I'd rather be alone forever Than to live my life like you. You build, DEDICATE Your life to the most depressing shit. You build, DEDICATE I hope this shit was fucking worth it. Don't say sorry for this and that. How you fucked up so bad. Any fool with half a brain can see where we stand. Never be like you.
