Memories, pale and gray. Nightmares clear as day. Echoes of desperation. Where am I? Who am I? Reality is slippin', slippin' away. Gotta get a grip, gotta hang on tight. I'm a couple screws loose, I'm out of my mind. I question who I am all of the time. Searching for the answers I'm never gonna find. I can't decide if I'm still alive I've lost myself inside my mind. Dead or alive? Did I survive? I've lost myself inside my mind. Dead or alive? I'm a couple screws loose, I'm out of my mind. I question who I am all of the time. Searching for the answers I'm never gonna find. I can't decide if I'm still alive And it scares me to death! I've lost myself inside my mind. Dead or alive? Did I survive? I've lost myself inside my mind. Dead or alive?
