Can you hear me yet Do you fucking feel me yet I'm still screaming Still losing my mind Animosity all the time Pull me down, pull me down Pull me down Fight myself this game I play How many bridges will I burn today Sinking to the depths of my own hell Down Down Kick me while I'm down you bastards fuck it all I'm tired, tired of trying to mend Just throw, throw me to the lions I'm tired of trying to mend Throw, throw me to the lions
