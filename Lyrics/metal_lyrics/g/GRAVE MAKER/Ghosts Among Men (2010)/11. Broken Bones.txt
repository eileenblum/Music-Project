Here I lay awake a-wishin' For one peaceful night to stop thinkin' How can I sleep without pain? Without burning? Without strain? I'm sweating in the face of death. Is this how it's gonna end? Two minds fighting one body. Dark clouds surrounding me. These broken bones, abandoned heart, I will never wallow in a pit of MISERY. I'll keep screaming for us tonight. We burden our pain. I keep spitting out the truth. SPITTING OUT THE TRUTH! I don't enjoy what I have Until it's gone and can't grab it. I never realized how it really was. And how those days are gone. I will never wallow in a pit of misery. I'll keep screaming for us tonight. I keep spitting out the truth. I blacked out again. Lost track of where I am. Screaming, "fuck this world for all it's worth!"
