No remorse, no self pride To back everything that we were, Anything we stood for. You ran, you ran, you kept running! Spineless coward with no regard to the people you've hurt. Your sheltered world, still to see its fucking worst. SPINELESS! Your face that fuels me! SPINELESS, Your face that ruins me! No remorse, no self pride To back everything that we were, Anything we stood for. You ran, you ran, you kept running! Spineless coward with no regard to the people you've hurt. Your sheltered world, still to see its fucking worst. See its worst! The slander you spit, the lies you cried! It never fucking existed! Cowards like you will die a thousand fucking deaths! Everything you claimed... And everything you famed... You tried to play me for a fool! This is, forever, me against you! Me against you! Cowards die a thousand deaths! Me against you! Spineless, spineless, spineless! Me against you! This is feeding what I am!
