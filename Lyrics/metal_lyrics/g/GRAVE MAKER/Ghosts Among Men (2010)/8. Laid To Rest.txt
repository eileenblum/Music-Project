You were never good enough for the good life. I was never bad enough for the flipside You're the problem, but I'm no solution. My best intentions laid to rest. Never wanted to be needed. Never needed to be wanted. Tonight I'm cutting ties, I'm not here for you! Never wanted to be needed. Never needed to be wanted. Tonight I'm cutting ties! Fuck you for depending on me! Never wanted to be needed Time to sever these ties. Drown face down in your fucking lies! This is us falling apart. This is me leaving you behind. I'm not here for you. These eyes, they see right through! I'm not here for you. These ears are fucking shut to you! Never wanted to be needed. Never needed to be wanted. Tonight I'm cutting ties, I'm not here for you! Never wanted to be needed. Never needed to be wanted. Tonight I'm cutting ties, this isn't up to you! Never wanted to be needed. Never needed to be wanted. Never wanted anything! Walk out that fucking door! Never wanted to be needed. Never needed to be wanted. Never wanted anything!
