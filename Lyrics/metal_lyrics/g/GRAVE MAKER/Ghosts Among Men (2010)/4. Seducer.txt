What the fuck are you looking at? I'm colder than ever, and you're not comprehending it Are you blind to these empty eyes That don't care if you live or die? You mean nothing to me! It's people like me - people like us Destined to be alone! So save us both! Tired of trying, Tired of giving up, Your comfort can't comfort me! Damn all the years of self abuse. When it's all said and done, That's gotta be what brought out the worst. You mean nothing to me! It's people like me - people like us Destined! Alone! Choke yourself on the spit from every word that leaves your lips! Destined! Alone!
