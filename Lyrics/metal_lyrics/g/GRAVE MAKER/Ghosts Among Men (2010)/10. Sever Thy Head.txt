Some days I feel I'm not alive Will I survive? Mankind has laced me with madness Sever thy head Remove this sadness Emptiness fulfilling me This is not what I'm supposed to be Look at what you have done I hate what I've become These fucking scars they will not fade Will I ever be the same? "What have you become? What did you do with my son?" These days when I sink down this deep All I see, I see a faded memory of what I used to be I hate what I've become This state I'm trying, trying to escape You will never feel what I feel This damaged ship at sea is not what I'm supposed to be What I'm supposed to be
