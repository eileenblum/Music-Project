I have no faith in the things you do In the end, whatever is easiest is what you'll choose Time to grow up and figure it out Wouldn't it make sense to stand up for who you're rolling with? You'll never have it in you to say what the fuck you gotta say Fence walker! Shit talker! Melt! To! the mold! Fucking pushover! Just doin' what you're told! You left me sick Yeah, you son of a bitch I can deal with it now You'll die who you ride with If you can't believe in me If you can't make up your mind If you can't pick a side Then I'm not worth the fight! You'll die who you ride with Fence walker! Shit talker! Melt! To! the mold! All you are is just another fuckin' pushover Just doin' what the fuck you're told!
