Don't tell me to look on the bright side All I know from life is the down side I made it far with none of your help Give it two years and you'll leave me anyway Once burned shamed on you Twice burned I'll watch you walk away Setting myself up for another let down Prove me wrong I'm begging you now Time heals nothing, Hate solves everything Now I'm taking names, who's to free who's to blame All which lie in my path will be treated all the same I can't tell you what's wrong, I can't tell you what's right Wait 'til I come around, then you can spit your lies Like I forget that time heals nothing The day will come when I will take from you everything Time heals nothing, Hate solves everything Time heals no wounds My patience hasn't healed a fucking thing
