I finally feel the tension of going against the grain I second guess my intentions living through the pain so lost, unsure, never knowing what to do soul-searching for what used to feel true this is all i have left I will push and I'll still fight for the search for steady ground is I won't forget the daily fight, I won't regret, I won't forget By these fucking valuse I choose to set I'll give my body rest and stick to these goals that I set And I won't end up like the rest no I won't I will live through this I'll put my fucking mind to the test Never again but no regret This heart goes out to the peers of my past
