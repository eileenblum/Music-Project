With my eyes shut tight I pray that tomorrow won't be the same But I fear that nothing will change once I awake And I'll only wish these weak arms will gain me strength So I can make it through tomorrow and sail away Never return, sail away Every single day I spend sitting here Is another day gone to nothing Nothing but this waste It's been so many years Still can't get used to this bitter taste Knowing I hold the power Sail away Never will I bother Sail away Keep this mast above the water
