Watching my world fall apart Preparing for this cold and misplacing my heart All that I have is slipping away I'm doing my best to keep it with me Faking a smile, lie to myself Life isn't fair, what the fuck am I to do? What's left to do? Form placing my hopes in your hands To drowning out the one Forgetting everything in this place Using this place to make my way through Doing the things you wish you could do I filled up my heart with all of this hate When all of it's done who will remember your name? This decision stands, I've paved my own way Ready to die- Let's fucking end it this way Place to coins in my eyes, let the boatman lead me home Take me home Put on your Sunday's best Shed some empty tears for me Place two coins in my eyes, let the boatman lead me home.
