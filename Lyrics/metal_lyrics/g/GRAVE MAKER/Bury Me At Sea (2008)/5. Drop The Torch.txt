Dead dreams, false hopes Broken ambition Your wretched lies and crooked disguise Reek of insincerities and life's passing you by Past your fake front Past all the lies Past our disguise Tie to move on old man Let it die You swing a mighty hammer but it carries no weight You hold no weight You steal and cheat to make your way through There is so much value in the wise and true A pair of shoes that will never fit you Drop the torch Give up on the Ghost Let it die Your past won't save you this time Your life is a lie
