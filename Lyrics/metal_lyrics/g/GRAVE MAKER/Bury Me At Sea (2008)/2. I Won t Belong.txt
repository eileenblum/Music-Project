This world it continues to scream I have no urge I don't wanna belong It keeps talkin' talkin' talkin' away But I'm tuned to a diffferent song There has got to be more than this Than this diseased air we breathe Than a path that leads me away from all of my dreams So please show me something real Breathe with me Give me a sign and I'll never let it go I will keep it inside, locked in my heart Not for this world to see, but to help my heart beat So if you wanna talk about your happiness If this is what we live for You can count me the fuck out
