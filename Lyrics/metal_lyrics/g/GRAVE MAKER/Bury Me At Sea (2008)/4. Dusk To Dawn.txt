Break free Escaping my bitter times Almost slayed by it all No hope in tomorrow A constant fall With abcessed veins, we live for height Product of addiction Blind to wrong and right I'm a symbol of destruction, with no desire to live Breaking every open hand All I feel is sin They're hoping for anything better With this illness so close to pleasure What's left to do except surrender? I'm making my escape towards the light I will chase what's right I'm breaking free Time to live for me I'm breaking these chains so I can breathe
