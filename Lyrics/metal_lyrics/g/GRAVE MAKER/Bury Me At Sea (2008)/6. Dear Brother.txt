Set yourself apart Let your guard down There is no need for the mask when I'm around Can I ever expect for you to make a change When you're trapped in your wicked ways? With every day wicked way Three centuries of life trying to maintain two centuries of regret One lifetime of pain Driving that same course: Self destruction and self hate No love, no hope, no gain There's no fucking gain Cant you see you are losing this game? I see only pain I wish you could see the other side this is not losing dignity or pride There is no battle too tough Dear brother: I will never give up
