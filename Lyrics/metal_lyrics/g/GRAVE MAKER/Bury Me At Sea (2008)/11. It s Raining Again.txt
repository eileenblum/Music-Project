Your crushing down on my lungs with this weight But I can still breathe, I can breathe just fine You've lead me away from the path which I've made But I'll find my way- Yeah I'll find my way in time Cause I know there's a better life than the one you lead And if I've learned one thing from you It's never do the things you do You're hoping the sound of your voice will save me this time Swearing ignorance is the key to the perfect life But I'm better than that, than to leave my heart behind And live for nothing These clouds from over head, but I'm not fucking running You're soaked in riches but I see through the pain I'll be on the outside forever looking in Cause I find comfort in the rain I'll dream of a time where your heart was open wide Before this world polluted your mind And I'll dream of a place where a smile once covered your face Before the perfect life turned you into a fucking lie And in the rain I'll dream- in the rain I'll dream
