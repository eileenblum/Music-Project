here I lay wide awake, listening to this city's life Something here calms me, and it comforts me to know That every step I will ever take leads me to another home I know one day I will speak of a time When nights shined brighter than days This is the path that leads me to the closest thing I call a home To a home with more than belongings that are bought and sold Each moonlight drive a radio sings a lullaby These nights where all is settled inside I should feel alone, but I'm alive I'm alive, looking at the sky Knowing some life wait for me miles away But I will wait I am just a tourist, just a visitor to these cityscapes To these scattered lights I find comfort within I hope this carries on for a thousand more nights A thousands more nights Let's carry on
