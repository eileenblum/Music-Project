I'm another nightmare What part can you not see? And what are you still holding on to? I have been a wreck since the start I've been dead for years Don't forget that this is all my fault I'm weighing down on you Nothing's changed and its starting to show You know you've got to let this go Let go I will only bring you down You know you've got to let this go
