Hey baby, Iâm your kind. A perverted twisted mind.
Tempting like an open wound.
Iâm the dragon of my kind. Pure corruption set align.
Roaring at a blood red moon.

I love resistance. I hate you. Perverse perfection. Dead, dead you.

Forbidden thoughts are released. I succumb to them with ease.
A perfect midnight crime.
Iâm a monster of a man and soon to Hell I will descend.
But now I feel alive.

I love the begging. I hate you. I love the hunting. I loathe you.
I love resistance. I hate you. Perverse perfection. Dead, dead you.

Such a shame to be caught in my prime when there were so many others, just waiting in line.

I wonât go away. I wonât let you sleep sound and safe.
I will always be there. Haunting your mind night and day.

Now Iâm sitting in the chair. No perfection for me to share.
Iâm guessing this is the end.
But, baby, we had so much fun. Too bad you managed to run.
No matter. To hell with me youâll descend.

I love resistance. I hate you. Perverse perfection. Dead, dead you.
