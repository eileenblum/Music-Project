Welcome inside our mind. All are present doing fine.
Weâre expanding. Multiply.

I will kill you. Iâll revive. Iâll condamn you. Youâll be safe.
Reconstruct. Obliterate.

Breathe it in. Feel salvation.
Breathe it in. Pure damnation.
Breathe it in. Iâll rip out your heart.

In a bliss and fill with rage. So consistent yet so vague.
Diabolic and divine.

Masochistic. Fragile soul. Incoherent. Chasing goals.
Standing ground. Step aside.

Breathe it in. Feel salvation.
Breathe it in. Pure damnation.
Breathe it in. Iâll rip out your heart.

Your life is over. Your mind divided.
Your prime is over. Weâre all inside.

âListen to us. Fantastic is an understatement for the wonders
we have seen. We are all one. We are all God. Hi. Nice to meet you.â

Here I am in control. Say your prayers. Save your soul.
Iâm Messiah. I am God.

Iâve done everything sheâs asked. Now itâs time to turn the tide
Delacroix, Step aside.

Breathe it in. Feel salvation.
Breathe it in. Pure damnation.
Breathe it in. Iâll rip out your heart.

Your life is over. Your mind divided.
Your prime is over. Weâre all inside.
