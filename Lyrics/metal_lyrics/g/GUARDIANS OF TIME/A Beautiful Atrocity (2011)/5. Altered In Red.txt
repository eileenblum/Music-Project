[Delacriox:]
Sledge on the anvil. I will hammer through.
Uphold entanglement of time.

[The Gatekeeper:]
I will sacrifice my soul, to attain and reach our goal.
I will be renewed.

Altered in red. Time torn to shreds.
Sickening fate. Gruesome fate.
I am divine therefore I will align
The corruption of time.

Pour out the anger. She must not endure.
She must be slaughtered like a lamb.

I will sacrifice my soul, to attain and reach our goal.
I will be renewed.

Altered in red. Time torn to shreds.
Sickening fate. Gruesome fate.
I am divine therefore I will align
The corruption of time.

Iâll fly away on a crimson set of wings.
