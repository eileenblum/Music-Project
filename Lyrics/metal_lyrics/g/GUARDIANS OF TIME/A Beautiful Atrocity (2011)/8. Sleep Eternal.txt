Sleep eternal. Sleep, youâll be free.
Sleep eternal. Close your eyes then you will...
See my splendor, see my beauty, see the realm of time.
Donât you worry. Donât be scared. All will be revealed.
Awake yet youâre dreaming. Know youâll be divine.

No oneâs intervening. Now you will be mine
No tomorrow. Without me by your side.
No tomorrow. Without my soft embrace.

Not awaken. Donât open your eyes.
Revelation. It all will come...

What has happened? Who has done this? What has broken loose?
Donât you worry. Donât be scared. All will be revealed.

No tomorrow. Without me by your side.
No tomorrow. Without my soft embrace.
No tomorrow. I canât let this go on.
No tomorrow. I will make it undone.

All are dreaming. And my name is carved in stone.
Youâre my chosen. Youâll never be alone.
What has happened? Who has done this?
What has broken loose.
Donât you worry. Donât be scared. All will be revealed.

No tomorrow. Without me by your side.
No tomorrow. Without my soft embrace.
