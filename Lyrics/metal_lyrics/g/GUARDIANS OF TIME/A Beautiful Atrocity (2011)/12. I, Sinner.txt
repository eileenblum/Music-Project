Call from angels. Hear the roar. I canât grasp what itâs all for.
Laying siege on my mind. Exaltation of my mind.
I have plunged into a well. Give them all a private hell.
Effectuate my crime.

And thatâs the story of my life. And I will not repent.
Follow where her wind blows.

[Chorus:]
I am the sinner but Iâm alive.
Answer the call through the fabric of time
I am the sinner but Iâm alive.
Answer the call through the fabric of time

Now she tells me to collect. Give me words I canât neglect.
I live in a twilight. I live between these worlds.
Sheâs keeping me alive in my quest to revive the family of light

And thatâs the story of my life. And I will not repent.
Follow where her wind blows.

[Chorus Repeat]
