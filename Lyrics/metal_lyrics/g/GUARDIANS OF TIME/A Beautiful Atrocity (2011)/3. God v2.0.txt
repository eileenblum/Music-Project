What only you know
What only you can see
What only you can be
Then Iâll be a God

Staring at this abstract world. Where am I now?
Always present, never here. What is this world?

Souls - dreams, everywhere. I will reap them all.
All this power, Iâm overwhelmed. It will be mine.

[Chorus:]
Show me what lies beyond
Show me what I canât see
Guide me inside the warmth
Be my guide towards the light
What only you know
What only you can see
What only you can be
Then Iâll be a God

Darkest pacts, Atrocities, Awaits the world.
God have mercy on your souls.

[Chorus repeat]

[Delacroix:]
"I see now how I came to be.
My legacy is power divine.
I will endure, I will prevail.
Phoenix Rising, paragon of might."

God rewritten!

[Chorus repeat]
