Six of us and thousands of her.
Weâre supreme. She is the bastard.
Fortified in armour of time.
This ainât how it was supposed to be.

Something hides behind the haze.
Something hides behind the seams of time.
The Guardians are making their stand.
A thunder cracks but thereâs no storm

A legion of dreams, a tidel wave.
Fiery eyes, prepared for battle.
Wipe them all out! Defend our realm.
Fight us, and your dreamworld will fall.

The keeper of gates, our only way.
We must create a dream to hold her.
Hold the line! Back to back.
To stop this madness he must be sacrificed.

Five of us, still thousands of her.
Open time. We must defeat her.
Oh, my child! Please lower your rage.
All your wrong may still be right in the end.

She wonât listen. No love felt.
You turned against us. Turned away.
What can you do? Where can you run?
What are your odds to survive the tide of time?
