Iâm a spectre. Spiritual. I am not physical.
Iâm a ghost of my former self. Omnipotent before my fall.
Take them. Make them on their knees.
Make them act on all my words.
Make a new paradise. Let my powers regenerate.

Then Iâll be more than a man. Make them be less.
Make them afraid. Make them feel pain.
The same as I felt. When they took my life.
Oh, they will pay. Yes they will pay.

Cynics. Evil. Cruel. Theyâre beasts. I am not a monster.
I donât cower. Iâm not tainted. I am not a monster.

Understand. I wish no harm. You will be my angels.
You will be in my design. Biologic mainframe.

Now Iâll be more than a man. Make them be less.
Make them afraid. Make them feel pain.
The same as I felt. When they took my life.
Oh, they will pay. Yes they will pay.

Cynics. Evil. Cruel. Theyâre beasts. I am not a monster.
I donât cower. Iâm not tainted. I am not a monster.
