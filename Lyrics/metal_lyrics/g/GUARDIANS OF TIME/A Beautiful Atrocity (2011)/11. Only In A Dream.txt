A muffled shriek. A silent cry. A dampened sigh.
And now she is away. She doesnât know. Sheâll never know.
Her lifeâs a lie yet she lives on.

Only in a dream. She sings for us, but...
Only in a dream. Calling out for us.

Ice cold logic quenched my sins. No need to hide.
Now we decide her monster inside canât be liberated.

Only in a dream. It pleads for her.
Only in a dream. We will sing for her.

[Guardian of Future Time:]
"Her reign has ended. What a beautiful atrocity.
My sins forgiven. Delacrouix, rest in peace and dream."

She doesnât know. Sheâll never know.
She must sleep. Never awake.

[Marie Delacriox:]
"Donât you want to be one with us?"

Only in a dream. She sings for us but...
Only in a dream. Calling out for us.
Only in a dream. It pleads for her.
Only in a dream. We will sing for her.
