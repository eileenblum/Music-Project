Iâm so high. High inside.
Iâve done something cold and unknown.
I have doubts. I have remorse.
I have lost my soul.

Turn it around. Safe and sound.
No one knows just what I have done.
Extacy of agony. Pleasure in the pain.

Hide behind a curtain of lies. Heart of darkness. Cold as ice.
Hide behind a curtain of lies. Heart of darkness. Cold as ice.

I know itâs wrong. I know what evil I have done.
I know itâs wrong. I know what evil I have done.

Hide behind a curtain of lies. Heart of darkness. Cold as ice.
Hide behind a curtain of lies. Heart of darkness. Cold as ice.
