You're a burden. Disgrace! Abomination
Displaced. You're a shame to us all
You must come to an end with no chance to ascend
You have brought your own fall

Shine your light on them. Light, your glory
Shine your fury and strike them down
Light the path for them. Wield your glory
Shine your fury and strike them down!

Enlighten them. Bestow them, your endless
love and show them the glory, the fury
Euphoria and strike them down!

All is over, my child. It is all running wild
It can't go on anymore. You can not win this fight
Raise your head. See the light
Bring an end to this war

Shine your light on them. Light, your glory
Shine your fury and strike them down
Light the path for them. Wield your glory
Shine your fury and strike them down!

Enlighten them. Bestow them, your endless
love and show them the glory, the fury
Euphoria and strike them down!
