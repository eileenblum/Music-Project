Beyond an irritation
A threat to our existence
Show "it" no recognition
And see if it's persistent

Tell all our emissaries
To do whatever it takes
And then end all their queries
Our fundaments it will shake

They aren't one of us!
They go against the cross!

Stop running. Stop hiding
There's nowhere else to go
It's evil. Primeval
Not for the world to know

Not for the world, not for the world
Not for the world to share!
Not for the world, not for the world
Not for the world to share!
