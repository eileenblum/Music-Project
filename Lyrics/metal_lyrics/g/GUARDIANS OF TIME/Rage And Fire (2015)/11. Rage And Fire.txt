Rage and fire. Crush desire
Where are your gods now? Suffer silent
Fire's brightened. All you need is bow

Call on your gods. Strike me down!

Tearing my body won't damage my soul
I'll never bow to your God
Burning my body won't tarnish my soul
I'll never bow to your God

Why keep fighting? Not uniting with my glorious goal?
Why not join us? Come fight with us
I'll make your life whole

From heaven I'm sent. Bow, Priest, repent

Tearing my body won't damage my soul
I'll never bow to your God
Burning my body won't tarnish my soul
I'll never bow to your God

You'll die! Purged by flames! You'll burn!

Tearing my body won't damage my soul
I'll never bow to your God
Burning my body won't tarnish my soul
I'll never bow to your God

Tear the flesh from his bones
Burn his eyes. Time is nigh
