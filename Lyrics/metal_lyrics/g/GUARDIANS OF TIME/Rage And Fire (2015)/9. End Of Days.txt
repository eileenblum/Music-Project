Come gather all around me. Now!
I will share my story and I will change your life
Lies. They are feeding you just lies
They're deceiving you
There's only one true god

To the end of days. I will hear his call
To the end of days. I will heed his call
To the end of days. God will save us all
To the end of days. Priest, your words are false

And his vengeance will be just. No more ignorance
Spill the blood of those born first. Offer sacrifice

What is this god of horror?
Why does he crave this sorrow?
Adam? Have you lost your mind?
No. I see clearer than all
I am the one that he calls father of human kind

To the end of days. I will hear his call
To the end of days. I will heed his call
To the end of days. God will save us all
To the end of days. Priest, your words are false

And his vengeance will be just. No more ignorance
Spill the blood of those born first. Offer sacrifice
