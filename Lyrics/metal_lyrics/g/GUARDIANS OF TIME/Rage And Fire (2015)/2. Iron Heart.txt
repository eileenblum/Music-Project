Cleansing your soul. Cleansing your mind
Cleansed from all of desire
Come to our fold. Step into our arms
Shed off your desire

Here you'll be safe. All be alright
There will be no damnation
All what you are. All you can be
Heading for salvation

Guide us into the light. Guide us in from the sun
A heart of iron guides my way
A heart with power all obey

This is our world. It's what we are
Feel your heart tire
Open your mind. Let us inside
It will vanquish the fire

The fire that burns. The fire that yearns
The fire that called desire
No need to learn. Well make you turn
Then we'll bring you higher

Guide us into the light. Guide us in from the sun
A heart of iron guides my way
A heart with power all obey
