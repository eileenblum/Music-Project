Songs of serenity. Sing to the gods
I pray for tranquillity. Save our sacred souls
Gods save us

Sovereign we're not. Your time has come
We're silent. Save your words
We'll let life take its course
Save your words cause their all in vain

Why do you punish us? Why don't you care?
We can not contaminate. You fate is written down
Gods save us

Sovereign we're not. Your time has come
We're silent. Save your words
We'll let life take its course
Save your words cause their all in vain

Save me!
