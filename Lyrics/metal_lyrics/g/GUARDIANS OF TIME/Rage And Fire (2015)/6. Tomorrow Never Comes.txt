See this. I could not believe. All I know is a lie
Why was all this once concealed. Why is this awry
All this knowledge. New to me. All of this subdued
All of this will change the game
Out comes the truth

All the world must open their eyes
All the world will arise
All the world must open their eyes
Tomorrow never comes

Five of them to rule it all. One to guard the gate
One will soon stand up to them. They will seal her fate
This won't be kept to myself. This will all be shared
This will change it all someday
This should not be feared!

All the world must open their eyes
All the world will arise
All the world must open their eyes
Tomorrow never comes
