Time has changed. Time to go
Time to end your life
Eons change. Things turned strange
My existence rife

And the mind deludes the heart
And the heart is ripped apart
And the sorrow of this life
Will end at last

End of the life. Let deaths wings sweep over me
Ending the life. Let deaths wings sweep over me

Alter me. Set me free. Modify my being
So much more. Change my core. Liberate within

Cause the mind deludes the heart
And the heart is ripped apart
And the sorrow of this life will end at last

End of the life. Let deaths wings sweep over me
Ending the life. Let deaths wings sweep over me

Change my core
