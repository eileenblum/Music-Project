The world is, is changing. We need it rebuilt!
This place is, is evil. Let's rid it of filth
He's walking, walks with us. He gives us faith
Come with me. Turn with me. Before it's too late

I'll take them. I'll fight them. I'm standing tall
Defeat them. I'll kill them. I'll take it all

Such madness. Such sadness. He has gone insane
We're dying. We're crying. He'll be our bane

I'll take them. I'll fight them. I'm standing tall
Defeat them. I'll kill them. I'll take it all

You shall walk the path I've paved
Turn to glory. Die and you'll be saved!

I'll take them. I'll fight them. I'm standing tall
Defeat them. I'll kill them. I'll take it all
