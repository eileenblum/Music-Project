Last night I chose to end my life.
Become a part of the virtual entity.
Reduce myself to just a name,
A number and build my ID up from scratch.

My life has become cold.
New life, new ID.
Only connected through the faceless society.

Today my new life began with logging on.
Disconnected from the flesh and construction has begun.
This virtual entity is me, the re-born "I".
No human errors, only binary is real.

My life has become cold.
New life, new ID.
Only connected through the faceless society.

I live life on the screen; this is my new home.
No longer have a face...
A cable in the wall:
My link to New World,
Only a number: no name.

Only live life through the faceless society.
I live my life through the faceless society.

My life has become cold.
New life, new ID.
Only connected through the faceless society.
