"Will the plan succeed and will future escape the consequences of his actions?"

Something is wrong inside the family of light.
"Wonderful": Just a scam, not the truth.
Tomorrow she will fall like many before.
Now it is done, step out of misery.
Another feels him call...
Many aggressive: followed a leader...
A voice had brought their souls inside.
Now he is opposing, sending a message: Opening their eyes.
Delacroix. What a shock before her eyes: No more!
He wants to take away her life! Another joins them all...
No more oppression, no more deception,
She will not catch their souls again.
Freedom is calling, her tide is turning:
Opens her eyes: Now war within.
Will they win? I can not see.
This was not the dream, as I wanted it to be.

After some time it becomes clear
That Delacroix is the strongest of the two sides in the conflict,
And after a number of the "units" manages to escape her mainframe
She becomes immensely enraged and finishes the internal war quite rapidly."

Now war within. Will they win? I can not see.
This was not the dream, as I wanted it to be.
Oh what a fight. War within.
It could not be that this was the end to be. What a sight...
