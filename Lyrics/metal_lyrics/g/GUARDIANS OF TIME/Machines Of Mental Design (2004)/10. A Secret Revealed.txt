"As Future's attempt to overthrow Delacroix,
By using the workers of TriOpticon, failed and backfired,
He now had a hard time accepting the defeat
Of his first attempt to correct his mistake.
The rest of the Guardians will have to be informed,
And it is very reluctantly he summons them
To confess his sins and ask their advice and help."

It seems like something is turning.
What did I leave on the earth?
He thinks the time has come.
What has my child become since birth?
Now I know what was burning,
Why I have this nagging sense.
How can I stop this yearning? Purest pyromania.
What did I leave on the earth?
What did I think of then?
He speaks to them slowly and soft.
The secret is revealed.
We heard that one is not learning:
So now please let us see how she made them the victims:
Purest thing ever on earth.
What did I leave on the earth?
What did I think of then?
He speaks to them slowly and soft.
The secret is revealed.

"One night Delacroix has a dream of being in an unknown and strange place,
Which she never has seen the likes of before.
This puzzles her mind and she is greatly troubled by this incident."

It is so dark in here, No light at all.
No faces here, none at all.
Where are all, where are all my many joys?
They have been stolen, just like my machines.

"The secret Future has been carrying is finally out in the open
And the rest of the Guardians are puzzled by Futures lack of development
When it comes to learning from his mistakes.
Delacroix is the daughter of Future: The secret is out."

What did I leave on the earth?
What did I think of then?
He speaks to them slowly and soft.
The secret is revealed.
