"As the result of a merger between her first firm,
OpticIcons, and TriIcon,
Delacroix establishes TriOpticon at the age of 34.
Press Statement: issued 17.04.2047, Paris.

Welcome to TriOpticon,
Welcome to the future...
We design the future.
With the birth of TriOpticon a new era starts.
Today is a historically significant day.
A Company like none the World has ever seen before is now in business.
With the merger of OpticIcons and TriIcon
A new landmark in every field will come to life every passing day!
Come join our family of light.
TriOpticon: We design the future"

TriOpticon, what are you to become?
Caught now inside, the new reason to exist.
TriOpticon, what will it soon become?
Now she is tied to this path.

"Only she can know, and see what will come..."

Growing up and getting strong, born and let loose...
And when the firm now rises,
She feels that her fears fly.
This will be me, this one urge to live on.
So it moves on. Lust like never before.

Growing up and getting strong, born and let loose...
And when the firm now rises,
She feels that her fears fly.

"The outline of her vision is now becoming clearer.
She has taken the first of many steps
In order to fulfill her innermost urges.
The firm is now established
And over a short period of time it grows
And soon expands beyond the borders of France,
Branching out into several other parts of the world."

Multinational: much more than dream.
Now the world is watching the company.
Built up from scratch, still more fights left to fight.
Some aims are gone; some just now in her tangled mind.

"With the Firms new status and wealth,
Delacroix is able to expand
And specialise the different fields of research further,
And also speed up their work.
As the contours of the next large step for TriOpticon begins
To mature in her mind as well."

The fire burning bright, carries on, this endless fuse.
And as the yearning grows, so does the firm now rise.
With nothing more to lose, at least not for her,
And watching it all come true, she hopes not ever to die.
