Oh no (mortality), what a dreadful delight.
Immortal: the purest essence of might.

"In the same instance as the Guardians of Time materialises themselves
In the tower, Delacroix quickly transfers herself into the Mainframe."

Guardians, intervening from beyond,
They have come for her, to end her fantasy.

[Delacroix:]
You left me, I hate you; please try to fight me!
Guardian of the Future: No mercy progeny; I can not let you live.
Mine, they are mine, they are mine... Mine and only mine.
You are mine; you are mine: Mine and only mine.

"The Guardians of Time use their powers to tear apart her earthly body
And the tower in an instance." But in the process something happens
As a result of what the Guardians does to destroy her world...
The essence of Delacroix remains on earth and not in the Mainframe as intended.
She manages to collect the scattered fragments of her soul
And takes on an abstract life form."

Trapped and lost. Everything is lost.
She's watching everyone. Where can I run?
Where can I hide from him? No one hears.
No one sees. Most of all no one cares.
They all obeyed, listening to her charming voice.
Mine, you are mine, you are mine. Mine and only...
Mine, you were mine, you were mine... Mine and only mine.
They are mine: you are mine... Mine and only mine.
You are mine... Mine...
