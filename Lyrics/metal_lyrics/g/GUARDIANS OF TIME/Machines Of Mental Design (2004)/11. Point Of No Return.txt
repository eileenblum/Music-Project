Started this life, I am the one to blame...
Family comes second hand.
Got to stop her now: for the future of man... Point of no return.
No more waiting from those who wants us well,
For they all know she has come too far...
(They come...) From far beyond the valleys,
Flies above the earth: Come across the river... Point of no return.
