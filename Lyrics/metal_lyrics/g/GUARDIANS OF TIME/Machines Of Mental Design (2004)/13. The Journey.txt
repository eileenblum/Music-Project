"And in the form of a spiritual being,
Delacroix disappears into the portal,
Which was left unattended, and into the Realm."

She has lost, now she is gone; she has nothing, she had all...
She has lost, now she is gone; she has nothing, she had all...
She is a beauty but a beast; she got caged, she was unleashed.
She speaks softly to your heart, as your head gets ripped apart.
You can not run. She can not escape the ones within.

"The Guardians of Time notices this and follow her inside the Realm."

Fades out, fades out. Nothing left behind...
Disappearing, vanishing. Pitch black eyes.
Won't you come along with me to another time,
Where you can be free? Won't you like to fly away, to another time,
Where you can be free? Something is wrong. What has been done?
Bright lighting as the sun, where is electricity?
Has my time come for me? Powers lost and where are I?
Staring in these demons' eyes, I do not know; is it too late...
As I am drawn to the gate.

"A battle commences.
Delacroix is stronger than ever in this form
And the powers handed down from her father now fully comes to life.
She gets away for a second, and due to her new found strength,
The Gatekeeper is not able to stop her escape
Through one of the other dimensional gates."

Fades out, fades out.
Nothing left behind...
Disappearing, vanishing.
Pitch black eyes.
Won't you come along with me to another time,
Where you can be free? Won't you like to fly away, to another time,
Where you can be free? Won't you come along with me to another time,
Where you can be free? Won't you like to fly away, to another time,
Where you can be free?

The Guardians does not see through which gate she escaped,
So they does not know where she is.
They did not succeed in destroying her
And so they must wait for her to manifest herself in history
Of that time or dimension she escaped to."
