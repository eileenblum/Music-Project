"Delacroix has won, and is out for the "unit"
That caused this delay in her work.
She quickly finds him after searching the mainframe,
And starts to dissect his mind for answers.
She soon connects the info she gets to
Why she has made quantumleaps in technology."

This technology makes past and future come together.
Lost no direction; found the path that led behind.
First to biology: to find the key and write it down.
That was my very first defense against the world.
She found the key; she knew that age would come to her.
Life is just an active search of life... Escaping time.
She saw the firm would start to live and breathe all by it self...
And so she starts to create a new human race.
She found the key; she knew that age would come to her.
Life is just an active search of life... Escaping time.

"It is to late to stop now.
She is to close to achieving her dream, her vision."

She found a traitor and he spoke himself of what she not knew.
The final pieces and now she has seen it all.

"Delacroix is astounded by the information
She now holds about her background
And how the puppets rose to cast her down.
Now her desire is further fuelled and with an even stronger resolve
She continues her work."

She found the key; she knew that age would come to her.
Life is just an active search of life... Escaping time.
Time is not the end. The end will never come for me.
No more to flee; thus escaping time.
