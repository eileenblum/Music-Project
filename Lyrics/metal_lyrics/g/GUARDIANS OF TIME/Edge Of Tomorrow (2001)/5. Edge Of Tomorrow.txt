They probe my mind, I am defenseless
Brought back in time, out of controle

Why am I here, what have I done here
Close to despair, out of control

Welcome to our way of life,
at the edge of tomorrow
Burning your soul once again

Like fire and ice, what an attraction
Scream in the night, tearing your soul

Welcome to our way of life,
at the edge of tomorrow
Burning your soul once again

It burns me
Crawls in me
It's out of control

Welcome to our way of life,
at the edge of tomorrow
Burning your soul once again
