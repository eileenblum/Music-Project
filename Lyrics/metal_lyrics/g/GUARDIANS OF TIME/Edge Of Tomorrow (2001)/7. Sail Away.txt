So many times I wonder, how things maybe could have been
How it would have seen. where I would been
So many times I have lost, so many times I wanted to scream

Sail away, let the stars lead my way
No more lies is told in vain
Fly away, what do we crave 
No more lies is told in vain

Now I'm left behind, with only myself to blame
For blowing out the flame, for blowing out the flame
A restless soul on earth, oh how it burns
Maybe it will turn, if I

Sail away, let the stars lead my way
No more lies is told in vain
Fly away, what do I crave
No more lies is told in vain

Sail away, let the stars lead my way
No more lies is told in vain
Fly away, what do I crave
No more lies is told in vain
