Now!
The race has just begun and now it's for real.
It's just like a fight of blood and steel.
Two tons of steel, Fumes and screaming wheels.
The engine makes me fly. Torque on high.

Iron meets iron. The body is trembling.
Pushing my beast towards the other side.

Come with me, I'll give you high octane.
Fly with me like a hurricane

Anger fills me. I shift down in rage.
Letting the power out. I'm on my way.

Come with me, I'll give you high octane.
Fly with me like a hurricane

I'm in the lead, my adrenalin flows.
Pushing me faster, my monster it roars

Come with me, I'll give you high octane.
Fly with me like a hurricane
Come with me, I'll show you the way.
Flying away in my hurricane

Iron meets iron. The body is trembling.
