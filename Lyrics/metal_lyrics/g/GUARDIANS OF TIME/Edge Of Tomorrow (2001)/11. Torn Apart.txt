In the night my mind travels far into the other world
Another dream comes to mind:Again.
When I see the land rise above my sleeping self
I realize a growing divide.

I see the way torn apart.
I seal the pain in my heart.

As the dream evolves, turns and flies beyond every path.
For travelling beyond the skies.
Of my ever growing fear of ever being one
with the world before know to all mankind.

Think about the endless pain if I could not return again
to my awakened life tonight.
Torn between the worlds of a dream and the awakened life
I think of them this night...Tonight

I see the way torn apart.
I seal the pain in my heart.
