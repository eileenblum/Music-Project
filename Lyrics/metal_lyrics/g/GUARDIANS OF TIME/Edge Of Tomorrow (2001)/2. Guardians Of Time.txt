Father of dimensions hold
The keys to our destinies
Beyond the gates where time stand still
The Guardians of Time you will meet

They're immortal, always have been
Protectors of mankind sins.
In past and present they will be
supremes, not like you and me

Time is precious, cherish your life
Remember the Guardians of Time
They are watching over you
Hail to the Guardians of Time 

Whirlwinds of doom
Storm from beyond

Watch them arise now
The Guardians of Time
Fight for a lifetime
Together.
Raising their swords now
The Guardians of Time
Fight for a lifetime
Together

Whirlwinds of doom
Storm from beyond

Watch them arise now
The Guardians of Time
Fight for a lifetime
Together.
Raising their swords now
The Guardians of Time
Fight for a lifetime
Together
