Tearless eyes stare at me, many lives are on my mind
Allowed to take lives without remorse
Years ago an innocent boy, now a man with sinners hands

All of my memories seem so far away this night
Like a dream fade away

Mist is decreasing, a shaddow ahead
Flash in the darkness a target is schred

Woman in front of me, cold an alone
Conscious erased, now she is gone
What have I done, how could I be a murderer
Falls to the ground still I'm tearless

All of my memories seem so far away this night
Like a dream fade away
