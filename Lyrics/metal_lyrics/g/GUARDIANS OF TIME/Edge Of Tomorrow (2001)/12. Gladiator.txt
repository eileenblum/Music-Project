Running high on blood and fire
No one's gonna stop me now
Raging on into the fight
Pray the lord to live another night, another night

Battle on to extend
The border of the roman glory
Thrust the sword into the flesh
And maybe I will die proud by my sword

Gladiators, warriors
Raise your shield and sword
Fight for no glory, fight to survive

Once in time was fame and glory
Followed by victory
Once a time had family
Now they are in another time another world

Gladiators, warriors
Raise your shield and sword
Fight for no glory, fight to survive

The vision will show the way
The clouds will pass
A sun will rise again

End of the night, alone in the colloseum
Who's my opponent, who want my soul
King standing tall, cold eyes is filled with honour
Brave gains the glory, weak man is bound to fall
