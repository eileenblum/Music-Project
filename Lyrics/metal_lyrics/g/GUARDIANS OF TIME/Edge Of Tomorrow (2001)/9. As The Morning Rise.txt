Her welming beauty is beyond compare
Like a starscream in the night
Still no one knows
why she's filled with despear

As the morning rise
As the morning cries
As the morning dies

She can't hold her tears now anymore
They come pouring down in streams
Still no one knows what she's longing for

As the morning rise
As the morning cries
As the morning dies

Is she gone now forever more
Does she hide behind the bathroom door
Doesn't anyone hear her anymore
Doesn't anyone see what she's longing for

"Father"
She tries to hide behind the bathroom door
"Don't hurt me anymoore" - "Father"
"Don't hurt me please, don't hurt me anymoore"
But it continues like before

As the morning rise
As the morning cries
As the morning dies
