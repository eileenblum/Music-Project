The little girl came up to her and said with trembling voice
mother I feel afraid
I had a dream last night, I dreamt that someone took your place
Please don't leave me alone

The mother bursted down in laughter and the little one in tears
This ain't the mother you have known
I am the shadow in your dream the fear that lies within you
I'm the harvester of souls

I'm just like the wind, the cold from the hills
Commanding your mind, for a moment in time

Is there something wrong, something I have done
To make your life less brighter now
Can it really be a conspiracy
Faith is laughing in your eye

Is there something wrong, something I have done
To make your life less brighter now
Can it really be a conspiracy
Faith is laughing in your eye
