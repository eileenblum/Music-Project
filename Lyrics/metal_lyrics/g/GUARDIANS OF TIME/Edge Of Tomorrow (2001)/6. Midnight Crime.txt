Imagine the darkness piercing your mind.
Fear has caught you again.
Time has come to pay for your crime.
Fury will remain.

Thought's go back in time.
What is my crime?

Stronger, aggressive. Born in the night.
A hellion is back in the night.
Just like a spider attacking it's prey.
No more will in sight.

Thought's go back in time.
What is my crime?

Left on the asphalt, pain is intense.
A gun is raised to my head.
Just like a thunder, the silence is gone.
A body left for dead.

Through these blood red eyes,
heading towards the skies.
Time to pay for your crime.
Your soul will be mine.
