Something's wrong in the world we live in
Some amiss in our lives
As the cold tear into our bones
We expand our territories

We must turn towards the ocean
The powering main
We must cross the great abundance
Setting our sails

And we're sailing for tomorrow
Bring them fear and sorrow
Sailing for tomorrow
To send them to kingdom come

As we ride the waves of prospect
As we drift to the west
We prepare our shields and axes
We will bring them devastation

As the rage and blood lust sets in
As berserkers are freed
We will gain their wealth and prosper
This is our creed

And we're sailing for tomorrow
Bring them fear and sorrow
Sailing for tomorrow
To send them to kingdom come
