It's the circle of all
It's the trappings of war
And you know it's all in vain
As the tides starts to turn
As wick slowly burns
They will never relent
They will never atone or repent
Never repent!

Power! Masters we were, by power we lost
Lost it all
Scores of life being lost and there is no cause
Lost it all

Now the circle has closed
And their fates are exposed
And we know it's all in vain

The assertion of all
It will bring down their fall
And the power is tainted
(In) their hearts they know they will fall
They shall fall

Power! Masters we were, by power we lost
Lost it all
Scores of life being lost and there is no cause
Lost it all
