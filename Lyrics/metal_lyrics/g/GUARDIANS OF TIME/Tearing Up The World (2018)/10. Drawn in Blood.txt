Tell me of a time, a time before the war
A time of calm, a time before the storm
Tell me of a time, when no harm was done
Tell me a lie, and I'll be gone

And you know all's serene before the flood
And you know it all been drawn in blood

Lo! See them warring on
Behold! The end of everyone

Once there was a time, a time before the dawn
The time was all, the time were in our palm
Once we had control, once we had it all
Control was a lie, now we are all

And you know all's serene before the flood
And you know it all been drawn in blood

Lo! See them warring on
Behold! The end of everyone
There won't be a time, a time without the war
The time won't come, the time without the storm

No! War is ending all
Your story's drawn in blood
