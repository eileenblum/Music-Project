It's all over, turned over
Time isn't on our side
No chances, circumstances changed
Took away our pride

So run
All come undone
Can't hold the line
All come undone
No light to shine

Retreating, repeating
Time to accept the loss
Endgame can't be obtained
None should have to bear that cross

So run
All come undone
Can't hold the line
All come undone
No light to shine

Light won't shine!
