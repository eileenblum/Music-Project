Sailing the oceans in thunder and rain
This is a voyage of terror and pain
We have the rage and obsession for land
We're landing our long ships deep in the sand

From the land of snow and ice
We will attack, we will arise

Cause we take on the world, watching it burn
Warriors of Thor, marching to war
Legions of Norse, storming the shores
Valhalla awaits in the end, for us all

Pale and unholy we march in the night
Burning your kingdoms and sparing no lives
You're begging for mercy but where is your god?
Your flag and your country, all drenched in blood

From the land of snow and ice
We will attack, we will arise

Cause we take on the world, watching it burn
Warriors of Thor, marching to war
Legions of Norse, storming the shores
Valhalla awaits in the end, for us all
