Marching along with them bound to go forth
Making a stand against aggression of north
Heads held up high they believe in the lie
"Recall what you've learned and you'll never die"

Sent to the grinder, their innocence lost
Racking them up, what a sight to behold
Warring for causes they can't understand
Dying in the fields so cold and alone

Soldier on
Together we will rise our brothers of the north
Guns held high
Together we will rise our brothers of the north

Thundering cannons blazing away
Smoke from the pyres makes night of the day
Cavalry charges like a live rampant flood
Cutting and kills, let them drown in their blood

Sent to the grinder, their innocence lost
Racking them up, what a sight to behold
Warring for causes they can't understand
Dying in the fields so cold and alone

Soldier on
Together we will rise our brothers of the north
Guns held high
Together we will rise our brothers of the north
