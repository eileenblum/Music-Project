Slowly it starts to decay
Softly the borders vanish
Enemies batters the gates
Life is seeping out

Gently the fires spread destroying our home
Slowly we witness the falling of Rome

Fire as the flames burning bright
Fire, bringing day from the night
Fire, as we see, as we witness
Behold the burning of Rome

Watching the greatness decline
Seeing the forums crumble
Perceiving the innocent slaughtered
Dies out and ceases to exist

Gently the city dies and fades into none
Slowly we witness the falling of Rome

Fire as the flames burning bright
Fire, bringing day from the night
Fire, as we see, as we witness
Behold the burning of Rome
