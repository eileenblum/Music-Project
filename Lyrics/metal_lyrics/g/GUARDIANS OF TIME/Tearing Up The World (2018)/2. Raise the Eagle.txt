Fall in line, prepare the wall
Let them come to us
Legionaries! Stand your ground
Listen and prepare

Sentence of the gods
Raise your swords, disrupt!

Rise the banners high
Let the eagle soar the sky
Let it soaring high
Raise the eagle in the sky

Push them back, let no one live
Gladius finds warmth
Step, thrust, block, sword soaked in blood
Fight us if you dare

Challenging your gods!
Eyes glow red, distraught

Rise the banners high
Let the eagle soar the sky
Let it soaring high
Raise the eagle in the sky
