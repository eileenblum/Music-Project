Heavy it weighs on us, riding on eastwards
Romano glory awaits for us
All are prepared and we all are adjusted
For war, for the splendor of Rome

We'll bring war
'Til there's no one left to slay
'Til there's nothing left to say
'Til there's no one left to pray
'Til their blood left cold and grey

Form up the ranks and prepare to repel them
Living and dying by, by the sword
Storm of swords, storm of blood, storm of honour
We'll bring the pain
Bring the hurt

We'll bring war
'Til there's no one left to slay
'Til there's nothing left to say
'Til there's no one left to pray
'Til their blood left cold and grey
