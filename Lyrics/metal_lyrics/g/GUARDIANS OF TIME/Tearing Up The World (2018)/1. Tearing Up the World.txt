Marching towards Gaul, I fight
Conquering them all, I fight
Reaching for the shores, I fight
Eager for the war

Raging on, I fight this endless war
Tearing up the world
World on fire, warrior to the core
Tearing up the world

Reload, steady, aim, I fight
Sabres drawn to maim, I fight
Trenches, far and wide, I fight
Gunning, run and hide

Raging on, I fight this endless war
Tearing up the world
World on fire, warrior to the core
Tearing up the world
