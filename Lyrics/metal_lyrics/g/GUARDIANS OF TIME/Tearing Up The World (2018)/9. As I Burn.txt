It's the war they said would end all wars
The war they fought so many times before
It's the war they thought would never come
Taking to the air as they are

Soaring high
Do or die
Time to learn
As I burn
Soaring high
Do or die
Time to learn
As I burn

Set the sights and open up the gun
Flesh is torn, they can not hide nor run
Flak is opening, blackening the skies
Ripping up and burns my body

Soaring high
Do or die
Time to learn
As I burn
Soaring high
Do or die
Time to learn
As I burn

And they came out from the sun
My last light came from their guns
8 mm ended me, murdered me, deleted me
