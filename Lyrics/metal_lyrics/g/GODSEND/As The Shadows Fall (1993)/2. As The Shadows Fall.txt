As the mourning cries of pain bellows
And the seeds rot and die
The nightmare of old is born
Into a world of song and joy

In the wind I cry
In the cold I die
Sanctuary hollow
Heaven is to fall

And falls down on the earth
To swallow all the creatures
Who hail the blasphemy of god

In the wind I cry
In the cold I die
Sanctuary hollow
Heaven is to fall

Ice, frost and death
Winds scream and twist
Hungry for heat to drain
Leave us in our pain

Before I die
I see the mountains cry
All fall down under the shadowfall
I will not bleed but sleep adour

In the wind I cry
In the cold I die
Sanctuary hollow
Heaven is to fall
