Sitting here in my room
Finding the time to hard to bear

Walking down the roads of the unbeheld
Walking down the roads of the unbeheld

Laying here in my coffin
Finding the air to hard to breathe

Walking down the roads of the unbeheld
Walking down the roads of the unbeheld

Walking down the roads of the unbeheld
Walking down the roads of the unbeheld

Flying on my wings of sorrow
Finding the skies to soft to tread on

Walking down the roads of the unbeheld
Walking down the roads of the unbeheld
