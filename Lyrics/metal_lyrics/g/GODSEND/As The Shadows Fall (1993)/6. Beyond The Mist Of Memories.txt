At night I wander
Between evil lines
Under a dark sky
Forever I shall die

Vails of sorrow I hear
Sights of terror I see
Grinding thoughts hurt me
Oh, kindness let me not prevail

Godless
Unseen
Undying I wander
Through the blur of dreams

Death on all sides
Friends of all cries
Foes laugh silent and cold
Beyond the mist of memories
