Feeling the wind
Flowing through the leaves
Flowing through what's left
Or us all

Uneasy thoughts fills me
As I look back on those days
the days of glory and fame
That are now lost and forgotten

Singing birds once filled the sky
Bringing their message of joy to the land
memories of goodness still linger
Though embraced by evil we are

Let all your evil free
Oh lord of all
Let them feel your wrath
For ignorant they have been
Embraced in their goodness
Safe behind their wall
Of their impaired god
That evil will demolish
