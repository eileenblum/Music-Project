I see them everywhere
Around me
Talking and laughing
Around me

Ignoring me like I was nothing
Like I was of pure air
They do not sense
My spiritual loneliness

I see them looking
Around me
Not seeing loneliness
Around me

Treating me like I was nothing
Like I was their plaything
They do not sense
My spiritual loneliness

Alone in this I am
Feeling what nobody feels
The spiritual depression
Pulling me down
Alone in this I am
Living in my world
Released is my soul
As light flickers
