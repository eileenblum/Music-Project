Silent whisperings
Fills my mind
Because I have
Drowned in my own...

Tears are flowing
Like a neverending
Stream of
Sadness

Sad am I
Because my feelings
Deep inside
Are lost...

For eternity
I have waited
To retrieve you
My lost love

In a deep
Sleep you feel
Never to
Breathe again

Floating
Above us
You are
Still here

Tending my
Sadden mourning
Tending my
Tearfull eyes

Flowers in
Your warm hands
Soothing
My grief

My life
Will never
Be fulfilled
Without you

Alone
I am
Until
I die

In memory of
Your beauty
My life I
Give to you
A gift that
You once gave me
So long
Ago
