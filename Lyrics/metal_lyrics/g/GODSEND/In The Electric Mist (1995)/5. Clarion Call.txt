[Lyrics &amp; music: Per Morten]

Passing by an old hotel
Looking for some action
Got no money, no cigarettes
No hope of satisfaction

The city's dry and full of dust
The cars keep rolling by
Faceless strangers and neon lights
Endless dreams and endless nights

Be brave, be strong
Be brave, walk on
Be brave, be strong
Be brave, walk on

Feeling just like I always do
I can't forget my brain
Fighting harder in every way
Dealing in hurt and praying for rain

A life designed to slow you down
Oh to lay back and forget it all
No escape for me this time
Within this walls I fell so small

Be brave, be strong
Be brave, walk on
Be brave, be strong
Be brave, walk on
