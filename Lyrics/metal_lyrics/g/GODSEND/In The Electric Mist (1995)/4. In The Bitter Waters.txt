[Lyrics: Per Morten; music: Henrik]

I walked ten crooked miles
In nameless lands beyond the sea
Got lost after a while
In fruitless search of my minds key

Among the mountains I cried out
The anguish of my mind
An echo full of troubled doubt
Came floating back in time

All these days of speechless longing
Senseless wait for who knows what
Troubled years without belonging
Rootless drift in aftermath

A young girl red and out of sight
Came walking 'cross the desert plane
Her eyes so sad and dark as night
Melody was her name

Only whispers came from her mouth
She felt to me like sorrows child
Her journey headed way down south
To hide in sleep a while

Alone I stood with no direction
Her presence nothing but memory
She could not give me her affection
Buried in grief and misery

Through the nothing my spirit roamed
Seeking the eternal silence
All these thoughts like hollow bones
Keep coming back I lose my patience

Why must I see all this destruction
When safety and happiness can be found
Who spreads all this thought corruption
To bring a young man to the ground
