[Lyrics: Per Morten; music: Gunder, Tom]

Eyes blind to the world
In the gap of dying
I'm coming: in the house of sadness
Lives my heart, so mystifying

Mirrormoon unwritten lines
Sets a heaven free
Eyes gazing into the unknown
Eyes eyes and crystal upon crystal

Satellites are watching
Each and every move
The night falls on your town
Watching the satellites

Unknown for you alone
Eternities now died away
Above you, silence, waiting so long
To hear this mortal song
