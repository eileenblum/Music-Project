[Music &amp; lyrics: Gunder]

[Dedicated to everyone who has lost a child in cot death. A light will always shine for them]

Light shines through the window
Down upon your bed
Looking in your eyes
Longing to be held
If I could embrace you
Together we would meld

Like an ethereal garden
Your room is filled with flowers
The beauty that I see
Makes me wish you were ours
A lonely sparrow sings your name
As your life slowly withers

My eyes filled with tears
As he calls your name
The sparrows gather 'round
To lead to your domain

You are drifting away now
Slowly as I hold you
With an empty heart I vow
Never to forget you
My child
