[Lyrics &amp; music: Per Morten]

The light is all around me
Flowing free
Inside the joy I've found

Coming near as I sigh
Nevermore will I cry
For it's time to turn

And the darkness dies...

When sound surrounds
You wish for more
The ship comes to the shore

As starlight shines across the sky
The sea is calm
And fear is gone

High flies the moon
High blows the wind
The heart of time
Is changing from within

The only time I feel allright
Is when I'm dreaming
Peacefull in the night

Sweet sleep inside a cloud
The planets move
Together in a groove

Coming near as I sigh
Nevermore will I cry
For it's time to turn

And I'm born like a child
All is new as you smile
In golden fields

And the darkness dies...
