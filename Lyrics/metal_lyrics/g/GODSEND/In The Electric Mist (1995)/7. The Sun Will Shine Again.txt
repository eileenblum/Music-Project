[Lyrics &amp; music: Gunder]

The world might seem dark and cold
Without a heart and soul
All the hepless, young and old
Silently gather and pray
That someday a light will shine
To take the away, and...

The sun will shine again
...my friend

A life that has no meaning
Is a life that's hard to live
Still we keep on dreaming
Of a world were we can sing
Songs of truth and wisdom
For the chosen ones to hear, and...

The sun will shine again
...someday

Towards the morning horizon
Hand in hand we walk
To begin another season
Of happiness and joy
All of those who followed
Will finally know
