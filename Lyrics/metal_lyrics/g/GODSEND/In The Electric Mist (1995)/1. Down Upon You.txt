[Lyrics: Per Morten; music: Gunder]

So glad that I'm not you
Wouldn't want to be in your shoes
Filthy corrupter of honest men
Welcome to the wolf's den

Every single step of the way
We'll be there to make you pay
As your world starts falling down
We will always be around

We'll strike down upon you
With great vengeance and furious anger
And you will know
A nameless fear
As we lay our vengeance upon you

Be our enemy we'll be yours too
No way out nothing you can do
Piece by piece you'll disappear
In sleepless nights so very near

We'll strike down upon you
With great vengeance and furious anger
And you will know
A nameless fear
As we lay our vengeance upon you
