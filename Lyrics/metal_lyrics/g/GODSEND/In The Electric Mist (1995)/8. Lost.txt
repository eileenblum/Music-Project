[Lyrics: Per Morten; music: Gunder]

Loneliness kills
I remain silent
Waiting will fill
Until death has its moment

Feel so alone
Summer is gone
Rain stars to drum
Freedom is on the run

Love, love, love
So lost without you
Pain, pain, pain
So lost without you

I lift the night
As the first stone

I'm walking restless
I'm on my own

Love, love, love
So lost without you
Pain, pain, pain
So lost without you

I borrow your face
I borrow your hair
I make a gesture
To hide this lonely stare

Love, love, love
So lost without you
Pain, pain, pain
So lost without you
