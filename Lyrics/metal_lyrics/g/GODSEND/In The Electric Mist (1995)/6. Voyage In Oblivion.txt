[Lyrics: Per Morten; music: Gunder]

Angel angel sorrows angel
Lift your head by the edge of the sea
The bliss of firefly swirling confusing
Distracts your mind will you reach out to me?

Dare you walk in celebration
Focus Orion the blink of an eye
Secretly charming the opus dictator
Erased like a cloud in the October sky

Walking talking chasing moments
Closing a gate in a passage of time
Ephemeral madness impression distortion
Return of your triumph in a nursery rhyme
