"In an old public hospital a forgotten man lies all alone. The sheats can barely keep him warm in the cockroach infested hospital room. Outside the dirt-clogged window the snow falls like gentle angels, while a couple of sparrows sing by the window. In a table by the bed is a vase with a near-withered rose."

cold white walls
are my only comfort
as the freezing air 
numbs my frail skin
only the fire within
soothes my tired soul
bringing shelter from this
cold winter chill

Sparrows by my window
sing a haunting tune
of hope and warmth
to ease my tired soul
these small, gentle creatures
show more love and care
for the sick and decrepit ones
than the people I have met

They bring to life
pictures of my past
all grey and bleak
devoid of any colour
