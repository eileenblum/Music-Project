"As the darkness falls, the huge towers casts tall shadowns in the moonlight. The metal and concrete facades, which emphasize an unsurpassed might, radiate and eerie atmosphere that chills you to the bone.
In the shadows of all this wealth the indigent seek shelter from the poor. With the preacher's words still in mind, their hope gives them the strength to carry on.
Among these Eron Walks, and sees he's got work to do"

The cold darkness
chills my peaceful soul
As I wander determined
through the city streets
the succulent air
It reeks of death 
the stench of shit
so awfully foul

The doleful inhabitants
are mere puppets 
taught to obediantly serve
the glorious emperor
his sick greed
for the ultimate power 
infects all life
perverting its purpose

Eidolon
The city of lost souls

The people break in hopeless despair
Their cries fill the air
the evil that has caused this fear
is someone the hold dear

A torn and wretched life the live
their freedom I will give
the evil that has caused this fear will fall into the sear
