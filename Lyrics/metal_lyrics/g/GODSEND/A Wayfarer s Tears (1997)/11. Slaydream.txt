Deep inside myself I seek for sanctuary
I'm running in my vision and there's no escape
I drag myself through endless voids of lost infinities
I can face the worlds of fearless destinies

Let me rest in your arms oh mother earth
You must save the one that you once gave birth
I see evil entities upon my way
I watch my dreamless nature as my body pray

Someone, everyone that can ease my pain
I regret it now when I see what I have slain

Someone, everyone that can ease my pain
I regret it now when I see what I have slain
