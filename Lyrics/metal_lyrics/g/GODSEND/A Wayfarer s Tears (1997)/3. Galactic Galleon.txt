"Galactic Galleon, a giant starship. Built of titanium, It's almost indestructible. With looming guntowers, the gothic structure casts shadows even in the vastness of space.
Its pilot, Eron, travels through space to seek those whose freedom has been bereft"

Ride the waves
of the cosmic sea
ethereal winds
in my crimson sail

the burning sun
a mystic sphere
lightning rays
at me wail

then truth I seek
all across the sea
freedom I give to
the weak and frail
