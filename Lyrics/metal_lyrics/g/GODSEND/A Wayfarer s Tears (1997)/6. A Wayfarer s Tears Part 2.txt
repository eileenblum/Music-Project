"By the window in a runned-down apartment, a young man with a torn heart sits, while the rain hails down outside, mercilessly. The room is sparsely lit, with just a few sticks of furniture: a table, a sofa, two chairs, a stereo and a fridge.
On the floor are scattered pieces of broken glass and bloodstained footprints. On the floor, by the window, are the shattered pieces of a picture that depicts one with a radiant beauty."

Every day heavy rainclouds hang over
as loneliness threatens to bury me
but every once in a while
a tiny light shines through
warming my weakened heart 
making my life worth living
therefore it saddens my soul
that you don't understand
your warmth is all I yearn for
yet pain and sorrow is all you give
the chilling wind and rain 
sing to soothe my pain
my heart feels so cold and dark
without the warming spark of love

A hollow wound is felt
where my love once dwelt
a lonely tear I cry
as the leaves pass me by
