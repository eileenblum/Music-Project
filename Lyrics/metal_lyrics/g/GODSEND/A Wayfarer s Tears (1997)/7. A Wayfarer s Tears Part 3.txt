"The rain is pouring down, while the wind is raging like a savage.
Down the treelined avenue a lost soul walks, seemingly untouched by the fierce weather.
The ground is littered with orange-yellow leaves, a memory of what was a beautiful summer. There is no sign of life, except for a lonely crow fighting against the wind."

A crow flies listless
singing a song of sadness
with heavy wings it struggles
against the vicious bogles

Its dark eyes are hollow
the pain it bravely swallow
suddenly I am aware
a common pain we share
and now I comprehend
to the weak I must tend
to the very end...

The piercing rain stings
the bird's battered wings
as it tumbles to the ground
into a muddy mound
