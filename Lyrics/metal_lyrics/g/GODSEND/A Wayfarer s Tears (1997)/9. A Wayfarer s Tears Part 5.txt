"A tired old man sits on a hill, looking at the beautiful scenery and the dark, gloomy city below that is like a cancer in mothernature's bosom. The winds' whispering chants of nature's lore echoes in the swaying trees, providing spiritual guidance to those who choose to listen.
The city's looming structures cast woeful shadows, while the homeless try to find shelter for another rainy night.
At the chapel of the Forgotten, a young petite woman  tends to the weak. She too will learn that her face will forever be marked by the grief of others. In an old public hospital a forgotten man lies all alone. His body scarcely alive, as his life slowly drifts away. This faithful servant finally gets his well deserved rest."

The wind, it whispers
singing its chants
filling the air
with its love

The trees. moving
creaking in unison
filling the air
with their wisdom

The birds, flying
joining the wind
filling the air
with their hope

All this music
lightens my heart 
filling my soul
with spiritual strength

As life slowly flickers
these memories fill my mind
most of them are a painful reminder
but their purpose I can find

And in seemingly 
dense darkness
a blazing effigy
flies above
giving me comfort 
near the end
she's the one 
I've always loved
