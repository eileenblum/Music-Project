So long
The war is going on
For so long

So strong
The enemy's so strong
He's not gone

You bleed
Your enemies will keep
Their siege

You fell
The end is now so near
But they can't see it

Ceasefire -- big lie

They talk
Instead of helping you
They talk

Your stores
Are coming to an end
You'll starve

It's time
To end this fucking war
It's time

It's a crime
That nobody can help
It's a crime

You wait
For another ceasefire
You beg
For another lifeline
All what you see
Is another victim
All what you hear
Is another shooting

Ceasefire -- big lie

No hope
Is left inside of you
No more hope

No pope
Can help you in your place
No fucking pope

They say
They're doing all they can
That's what they say

Insane
Is what they really are
They've lost their brains
