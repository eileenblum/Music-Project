You tell me all the time
The things you don't like
The people you hate

You think you're smart
You smell like a fart
So go away

The things you do
Are enough for you
To ease your pain

You'll win each fight
To keep your mind
Without a stain

People like you have nothing to do
With the human race
Fears in your mind in all different kinds
Shining through your gaze

You act so cool
In fact you're a fool
But you're so blind

Too blind to see
The things you need
To free your mind

Always want more
More than before
Never satisfied

You act like a star
Drive a big car
And that's your pride

People like you have nothing to do
With the human race
Fears in your mind in all different kinds
Shining through your gaze

Scum, you scum, you scum
Scum, you scum
The only thing I want is to hate you
Scum, you scum, you scum
Scum, you scum
The only thing I want is to kick you

Only thing I know is I hate you
Only thing I want is to kill you, die....
