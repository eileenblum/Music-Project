I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be alone
I don't want to know your trend
Turn around and hope you're gone

Just don't ask me what you can do
This is your life and your way
To succeed or to fail
Do ya find your trail ?

Don't ask me what's right for you
Only you are the one
To feel sad or have fun
Do ya cut and run ?

So you want me to help you
Tried so many times to cure
Your addiction will kill you
You won't stop, that's for sure

Just don't ask me what you can do
This is your life and your way
To succeed or to fail
Do ya find your trail ?

Just don't ask me what you can do
This is your life and your way
To succeed or to fail
Do ya find your trail ?

Don't ask me what's right for you
Only you are the one
To feel sad or have fun
Do ya cut and run ?

All your friends are dying
Your health and pride dies too
Feel your ruin but you deny it
Soon it's to late for you...
