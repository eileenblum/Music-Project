Get the fuck up and jump around

Standing there and wait for more
Don't know what you're waiting for
Try to keep your feet on the ground
Get the fuck up and move your butt

No way to keep control
Crowd's screaming wants some more
Share the feeling or leave the hall
Get the fuck up and jump around

Get up, get up, get
Get the fuck up and move your butt
Get up, get up, get
Get the fuck up and jump around

You know the band is back in town
And all the girls are bending down
Everybody's into the sound
Get the fuck up and move your butt

Feel the music in your head
It doesn't matter what you said
Coming over you again
Get the fuck up and jump around

Get up, get up, get
Get the fuck up and move your butt
Get up, get up, get
Get the fuck up and jump around

If you like clap your hands
Move yourself into the trance
No excuse if you can't dance
Get the fuck up and move your butt

Feel the power make it yours
Open up be not a fool
Be not afraid there are no rules
Get the fuck up and jump around
