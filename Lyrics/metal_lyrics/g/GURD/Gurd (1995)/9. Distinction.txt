Say would you talk with me
Say would you be with me
You know this cannot be
Got the money but you're not free

You're looking down on me
You put your thumb on me
Think you can play with me
But you're the last one I need

Distinction
Is what keeps us apart
Your distinction
Your money is your god

Don't believe the things you read
Watch the world right from your seat
You believe just what you see
Your stupidity is killing me

Distinction
Is what keeps us apart
Your distinction
Your money is your god
