I'm so sick of what you call the truth
Only your truth is true for you

I'm so sick of what you think is good
Instead of going you will waste your food

Got enough of all your promises
I spit on you and your holy guest

Got enough of all your fairytales
You gave me nothing but bitter pills

I heard enough
To hear my own voice

I saw enough
To take my own choice

You damn suckers are telling me lies
But I can see through your disguise

You damn suckers take care and watch out
You don't even know what I'm talking about

How will you know what's good for my life
Leave me alone, I'd rather die

How will you know what I do feel
For you my thoughts are so unreal

No more, no more...
