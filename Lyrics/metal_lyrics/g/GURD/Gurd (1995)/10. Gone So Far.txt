Is it true we rape the nature
Is it true we hate each other
Is it true we reach another
Point of no return

We don't behave like brothers
All these murders all among us
There's an evil force that watches
each and every step

No chance to win this eternal war
As soon as this day will come
We will see that we have gone too far

Alone with all these bad things
Alone with all sad feelings
Alone and my ship is sinking
down to the depths of hell

I see these flames are burning
I see these demons working
I see the world is turning
Upside down

No chance to win this eternal war
As soon as this day will come
We will see that we have gone too far
Gone too far
Gone too far
Why have we gone so far ?

No turning back...

There will be no return
There's nothing left to earn
No matter what we have learned
We have crossed the magic line

So what the hell is left then
No fucking bird is left to sing
Destroyed your life, destroyed your home

No chance to win this eternal war
As soon as this day will come
We will see that we have gone too far
Gone too far
Gone too far
Why have we gone so far ?

No turning back...
