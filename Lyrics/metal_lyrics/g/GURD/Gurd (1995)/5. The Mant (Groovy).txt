I'm wasting my time
'cause I'm trying to dance here all night
Everybody's enjoying my sight
I hope I get off with a bad fright

I'm moving like a jerk
So I try to get groovy, it doesn't work
Tell me what am I doing to myself
I have to leave
This fuckin' hell

Get groovy
c'mon move it
Get groovy
c'mon, c'mon move it

They're staring at me
It's necessary to flee
So I gonna get out of this place
Just want to try
To save my face

Now there is this guy
He's got this light deep in his eyes
He's got this doobie just for me
And after a while
I feel so free

Get groovy
c'mon move it
Get groovy
c'mon, c'mon move it, move it

Oh my god what am I doing here I need some help
Oh my god what am I doing here I need some help
Oh my god what am I doing here I need some help
Oh my god what am I doing here I need some help
Oh my god get groovy
c'mon move it
Get groovy
c'mon, c'mon move it, move it, move it
