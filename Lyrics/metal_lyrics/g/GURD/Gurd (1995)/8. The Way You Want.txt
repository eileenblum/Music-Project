Satisfy my feelings
With loudness from my speakers
I just know I need this

Pumping up the volume
As loud as I can listen
There's nothing now I'm missing
I feel so alright

If I don't live the way you want
I just don't want to play a part
If I don't play the way you want
I just don't care

My brain is what I'm sealing
Protect it from your dealing
In truth I am believing

The weed is what I take now
To free my mind from you, pal
I want to show how

I want to live my life

If I don't live the way you want
I just don't want to play a part
If I don't play the way you want

I don't care
what you want

Never changing my life
never stopping my fight
I will always survive

My guitar wants to kill you
Saw the things that you do
My chords they now will hurt you
Hope you like my sound ...
