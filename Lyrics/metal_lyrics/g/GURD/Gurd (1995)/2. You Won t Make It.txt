Goddam, Goddam,
Tell me who's to blame
When I see the starving people on the screen again

Goddam, Goddam,
Tell me who's to blame
If you think I need the army to be a man

So wrong, so wrong
Everything you say
You're lying to the people just to make your way

So strong, so strong
Growing everyday
You try to hide your lies behind the word you say

You won't make it
You won't make it
You won't make it
Is what I say

You won't make it
You won't make it
You won't make it
No, no way

You talk, you talk
Don't want the war
In fact it is the only thing you're waiting for

Your walk, your walk
Never stopped before
And you never realized there could be more

I know, I know
What you have planned
Control all the people like puppets in your hand

I know, I know
I'm not your man
As long as I can think I am against your plans

You won't make it
We can change it
You won't make it
We're gonna change it
