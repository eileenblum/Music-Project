It seems, it seems
It seems to me you are insane
My dreams, my dreams
You took my dreams and throw them away

I believe, I believe
The only thing you know is hatred
Look at me, come look at me
And see the one which you have wasted

I owe you nothing
I never did
I owe you nothing
Come and take your shit

I see, I see
The years with you they made me crazy
Finally, oh finally
I took the only way to exit

I'm free, now I'm free
I'm free to do the things I wanted to
Your greed, your damned greed
Your greed has killed the good inside you

I owe you nothing
I never did
I owe you nothing
Come and take your shit

I owe you nothing
I owe you nothing
I owe you nothing
I owe you nothing, bitch
