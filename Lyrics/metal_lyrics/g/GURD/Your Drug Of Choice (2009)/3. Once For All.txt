You tortured us, you made us bleed - but we stand tall
And I can see you've reached the end - your final call
Headshot - you need a headshot
You'll never let me be - you never want to leave
Headshot - you'll get a headshot
Give me one good reason to let you live
Headshot - you need a heashot
The only thing you've earned so far
Headshot - You'll get a headshot
A failure is just what you are
So in the end I will succeed - and you have lost
This is your end, this is your fate - and you're star-crossed
Once for all - seal your fate
See the wrath upon my face
Once for all - feel my hate
Count me in to your disgrace
Headshot - you need a headshot
You'll never let me be - you never want to leave
Headshot - You'll get a headshot
Gimme one good reason to let you live
Headshot - You need a headshot
The only thin you've earned so far
Headshot - you'll get a headshot
A failure is just what you are
I tend to differ from your kind - I take a stand
I always saw through all your lies - your words were bland
Once for all - seal your fate
See the wrath upon my face
Once for all - feel my hate
Count me in to your disgrace
Once for all - face your end
Deadly fear - life is spent
So in the end I will succeed
And you have lost
This is your end, this is your fate
And you're star-crossed
