What's going on inside you
What's on your mind today
What happens should remind you
Of long lost better days
What happened to our mankind
Knowledge is lost today
We poisoned our mind now
We have a price to pay
Stuck - in a box
Mankind is closing their eyes
Stuck - in a box
Endless repeating our lives
And our souls will strive
If we want to ascend there
We should now start to see
If we would start to act fair
Now great this place could be
We have to lose the bad blood
We have to start to trust
We have to ditch the false gods
And we'll discover the cause
Caught inside the kharmic wheel
How can we break out?
Stuck inside this big black box
What's this all about?
Stuck - in a box
Mankind is closing their eyes
Stuck - in a box
We have to stop to be blind
Stuck - in a box
Mankind is closing their eyes
Stuck - in a box
Endless repeating our lives
And our souls will strive
