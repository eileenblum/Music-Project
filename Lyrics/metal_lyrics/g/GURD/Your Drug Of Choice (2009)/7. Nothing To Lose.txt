It's just the way it goes - it's just the way it goes
It's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - Nothing to lose
(Never want to - never have to - never will you lose)
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
I come from beyond
I did hear your call
You ask why I'm here - because you wanted so
What is it you want
I wait for your fall
You know why I'm here - because you wanted so
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
(Never want to - never have to - never will you lose)
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
The sins of your past
Came down in a clash
You let yourself go - because you wanted so
Your ship sinks so fast
You lived like a flash
You threw it away - because you wanted so
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
(Never want to - never have to - never will you lose
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
It's just the way it goes - it's just the way it goes
It's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes
Come closer to me
And just let it be
We go to my plate - because you wanted so
I take you away
You'll never be free
I reap what I sow - because I want it so
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
(Never want to - never have to - never will you lose)
Nothing to lose - what will you choose - nothing to lose
