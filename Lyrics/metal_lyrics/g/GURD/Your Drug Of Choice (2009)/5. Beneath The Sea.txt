We're crawling onto land
With our masses we'll prevail
A swarm is what we are
Our structure is our bail
Controlling everything
We strike back with all our might
Polluting our world
You deserve this final fight
The swarm is here - the swarm is here
(And you die - and you cry - and you die)
The end is near - the swarm is here
We lived so long - beneath the sea
We came to heal the mother
Our minds are one - the spirit's us
The ocean is our father
Attacking all our ships
Biohazard is our name
No chance for your mankind
We're the masters of the game
Soon we have conquered you
There's no place for you to hide
You can't defeat us all
We have millions by our side
The swarm is here - the swarm is here
(And you die - and you cry - and you die)
The end is near - the swarm is here
We lived so long - beneath the sea
We came to heal the mother
Our minds are one - the spirit's us
The ocean is our father
Those who live beneath the sea - used to wreak havoc on humanity
Those who live beneath the sea - are fighting against our insanity
You cannot stop us now
It is time to pay your toll
There's nothing left to learn
You have failed once and for all
We're crawling onto land
With our masses we'll prevail
A swarm is what we are
our structure is our bail
