From the darkest skies - decended in the night
Fulfilling prophecies - creation in their minds
Another world to live - another world to build
Eternal inheritance - a challenge to their will
Seven starz
Sever scars
Seven starz
Took a wrong course
Eternal will - to fulfill
They made them slaves - to obey
Wrecked their soul - locked their chance
Let them work and let men pray
Gave them strength - the will to kill
But shortened the lifespan they had
Godlike kings - eternal reign
Creation perverted instead
regency of self claimed gods
Soon came to an end
Resistance from their own false breed
Denied the heaven sent
War arose - forced to hide
Too mighty the masses became
Genocide - the only way
To tame the creation they made
Die!!!
