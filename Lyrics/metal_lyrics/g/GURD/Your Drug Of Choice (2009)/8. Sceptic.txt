Try to shoot
Try to kill me
You can't bring me down
'Cause I will fight you back
So afraid
Fear the truth in me
What I say
Is gonna make your world collapse
I think I can make you silent
I know I should try
You can not accept my words and
You ask yourself why
In your life
There's no place for change
Won't give in
You'll never get the knack
In the end
We will see who's right
You're afraid
Hide the truth behind your back
I think I can make you silent
I know I should try
You can not accept my words and
You ask yourself why
Sceptic
We talked about it
How can you doubt it
You'll be surrounded
Sceptic
We talked and argued
Now I can charge you
Your lies now break through
Sceptic
I think I can make you silent
I know I should try
You can not accept my words and
You ask yourself why
Try to shoot
Try to kill me
You can't bring me down
'Cause I will fight you back
in the end
We will see who's right
You're afraid
hide the truth behind your back
