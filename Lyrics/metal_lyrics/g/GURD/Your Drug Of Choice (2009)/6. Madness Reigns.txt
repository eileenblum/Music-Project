The TV discharges dummies with grinning faces
All we loved is falling into pieces
As we gather for our final consumption
Become aware of all that we have lost
And madness reigns - yeah madness reigns
Am I going insane? - Am I going insane?
Madness reigns - right out of the screen
Hiding the real thing with a gloomy sheen
Madness reigns - and we all follow
Making our lives just shady and hollow
Where do we go form here
Why do we live in fear?
And madness reigns - yeah madness reigns
Am I going insane? - Am I going insane?
Madness reigns - right out of the screen
Hiding thereal thing with a gloomy sheen
Madness reigns - and we all follow
Making our lives just shady and hollow
And madness reigns - yeah madness reigns
