Torn inside by your wrong morality
I want to end this before I die in agony
Self-destruction is taking it's toll
Lying here, I'm waiting for my last call
Pull the plug - just leave me be
Take the needles away from me
Pull the plug - just set me free
And let me die in dignity
Human mind tends to color all the memories
I am aware of all this pain inside of me
I'll take the ride to my next life with a smile
A new begin, I hope this was my last cry
Just let me die - just let me go
Now let me die - now let me go
Pull the plug - just set me free
And let me die in dignity
Shut me off to rescue me
Let me die in dignity
Pull the plug - just leave me be
Take the needles away from me
Pull the plug - just set me free
And let me die in dignity
Just let me die - just let me go
Now let me die - now let me go
Pull the plug - just set me free
And let me die in dignity
Shut me off to rescue me
Let me die in dignity
