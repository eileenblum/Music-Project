Oppression - regression
They said they came to save you from yourself
They said they came to settle down and dwell
But they won't let you live the way you want
They are oppressive and say you're the cause
Let us free - let us be
We don't want to follow and obey
We're not staying calm for you today
Did you ever question you are alright?
Can you sleep without bad dreams at night?
Our minds tend to be free
I stand up today
Freedom now for you and me
We stand up today
Destroying our culture with a clash
What we preserved will soon turn into ash
Their guns and armor put us under will
They're here to conquer and they're here to the kill
Let us free - let us be
We don't want to follow and obey
We're not staying calm for you today
Did you ever question you are right?
Can you sleep without  bad dreams at night?
Our minds tend to be free
I stand up today
Freedom now for you and me
We stand up today
