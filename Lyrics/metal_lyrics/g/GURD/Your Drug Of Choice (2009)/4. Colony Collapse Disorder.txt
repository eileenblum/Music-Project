You should worry about our race
You should care about us
Pollination is what we do
We are the hidden force
If we'll go extinct
You will starve to death
We are a dying breed
You too will take your last breath
No one knows what's the cause for this
We will just disappear
All the flowers will soon be gone
Our death is your fear
If we'll go extinct
You will starve to death
We are a dying breed
You too will take your last breath
Soon will be the day
Soon we're far away
When we're gone you can't survive
When we're gone you can't survive
When we're gone you all will die
Are we really doomed to die?
Is there a second chance?
Is this nature's revenge on you?
You see your end at first glance
If we'll go extinct
You will starve to death
We are a dying breed
You too will take your last breath
