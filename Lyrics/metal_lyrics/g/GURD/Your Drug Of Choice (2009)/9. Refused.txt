Turning myself around
And watch the scene unfold
Wisdom I have found
I refused advices bold
Nothing can stop me now
And nothing ever will
I'm paying anyhow
And I wait for the final bill
Refused - get away
Refused - anyway
Refused - refused - refused
Seven league boots I have
And with giant steps I walk
Leaving the crooks behind
With a golden tongue I talk
Never will I regret
The deeds which I have done
Better watch out for me
Or bitterness will come
Refused - get away
Refused - anyway
Refused - refused - refused
