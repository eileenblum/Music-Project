Say what the fuck you want from me
Say who the fuck you want to be
You tend to worship your own self
Addicted to your selfmade hell
Make your - decision
Which role you want to play
Tell me - what is
Your drug of choice today
Your goddamn life will fall apart
If you can't stimulate your heart
You want your fix - you want it now
You need your drug - your own private hell
Make your - decision
Which role you want to play
Tell me - what is
Your drug of choice today
Can I stay - another day?
Say what's the difference to my need?
Does it look different when you bleed?
Go shove your notion up your ass
Your own behavior is one big mess
Make your - decision
Which role you want to play
Tell me - what is
Your drug of choice today
Wonderful - beautiful
Can I stay - another day?
