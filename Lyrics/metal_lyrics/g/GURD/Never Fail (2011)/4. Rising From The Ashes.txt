Rising from the ashes
Because it's never too late
Looks like a miracle
From the cradle to the grave

Rising from the ashes
We will defy our death
Not mythological
But victory for the brave

Go down in flames
Rise from your grave
Go down in flames - wait for the miracle
Ride the new wave - behold the miracle

Rising form the ashes
But first we have to burn
We will be back someday
But still the wheel will turn

Rising from the ashes
A neverending ride
Our souls are here to stay
We've got a lot to learn

Go down in flames
Rise from your grave
Go down in flames - wait for the miracle
Ride the new wave - behold the miracle

We came
We left
A neverending circle spins
We came - came
We left - left
Until we learn that we are kin

We still care, we still care
We still care about our pain
We still care, we still care
We still care about our reign
