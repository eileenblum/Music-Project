[Bonus Track]Built to last - a hideaway
A place which no one knows
Misbehave - but none will see
Friends turn into foes

Darkest place - a grave to her
Misuse your flesh and blood
Justice gone - no dignity
You're playing your own god

Secret underground
Punishment - will come around

Hide your sins - the beast in you
You're gonna rot in Hell
Innocence = destroyed by you
Won't see how deep you fell

Living trapped - in secrecy
The abyss will devour
The sins you've done - the pain you gave
Until the final hour

Secret underground
Punishment - will come around

She'll never see the light
She'll never see the light
She'll never see the light
She'll never see the light

Again...

Will be your secret bride
Will be your secret bride
Will be your secret bride
Will be your secret bride
Again...
