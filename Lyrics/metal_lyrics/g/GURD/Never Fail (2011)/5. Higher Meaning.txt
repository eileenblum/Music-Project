You laid to rest all those who once meant all to you
Senseless passing - a flick of an eye away

A higher meaning - is what they say
You must believe it - is what they say
A higher meaning - a higher meaning
You must believe in - you must believe in

There is a sense behind you soon will recognize
Gives you shelter - a twist of a word away

A higher meaning - is what they say
You must believe it - is what they say

All this fear - all this pain
The world's insane - but they still pray

There's too much pain around to listen to their words
Get yourself straight - don't let them live your life

A higher meaning - is what they say
You must believe it - is what they say
A higher meaning - a higher meaning
You must believe in - you must believe in

A higher meaning - is what they say
You must believe it - is what they say

A higher meaning - you must believe in!
