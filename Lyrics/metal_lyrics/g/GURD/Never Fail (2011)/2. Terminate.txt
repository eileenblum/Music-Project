You can't - you can't
You cannot get away
No matter what your people say
You won't - you won't
You will not get away
It does not matter to whom you pray

I take your life
Stare in your eyes
Terminate - terminate
Terminate - meet your fate

I will - I will
I will not let you go
I'm searching, hunting high and low
No place - no place
My order be fulfilled tonight

I take your life
Stare in your eyes
Terminate - terminate
Terminate - meet your fate
