Your holy disguise
Can't keep the truth away
You want my demise
Turn my whole world to gray
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
Down to the ground

You took away the ones who I adored
You never fail - you never fail
You promised love but gave me pain once more
You never fail - you never fail

So why should I pray
You're just a pack of lies
You're just a cliche
Is what I imply
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
Down to the ground

You took away the ones who I adored
You never fail - you never fail
You promised love but gave me pain once more
You never fail - you never fail
Never fail - never fail - never fail
You never fail
