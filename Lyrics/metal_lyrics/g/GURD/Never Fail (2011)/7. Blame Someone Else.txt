What's the matter with you
What do you want me to do
Soon I'll be breaking your neck
And I don't think I'll regret

Shut up - or I get you out of here
Beat it - I start to smell your fear

Where you go, where you're going to
Where you go, so where you're going to now

Now you can hide from yourself
...You should blame yourself
Now you can blame someone else
...You should blame yourself
You're still breaking the rules
So do you know who's the fool
I am the worst you have met
And pain is what you will get

Shut up - or I get you out of here
Beat it - I start to smell your fear

Where you go, where you're going to
Where you go, so where you're going to now

And you can hide from yourself
...You should blame yourself
Now you can blame someone else
...You should blame yourself

What's the matter with you
What do you want me to do
Soon I'll be breaking your neck
And I don't think I'll regret

Shut up - or I get you out of here
Beat it - I start to smell your fear

Where you go, where you're going to
Where you go, so where you're going to now

Now you can hide from yourself
...You should blame yourself
Now you can blame someone else
...You should blame yourself
