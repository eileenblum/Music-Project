You gonna burn yourself
You gonna burn yourself
You gonna burn yourself

Never touch the stove
Be a notch above
Always do it right
With a cry of delight

You gonna burn yourself
You gonna burn yourself
You gonna burn yourself

The pain tastes so sweet
Everything that I need
I can make it tonight
There's no end in sight

You gonna burn yourself
You gonna burn yourself
You gonna burn yourself
