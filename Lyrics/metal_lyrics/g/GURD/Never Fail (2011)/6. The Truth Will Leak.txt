Hide it from our eyes
Try to victimize
It may take it's time
You can't keep it forever

Why are you so blind
Think you are divine
You shall never win
You're just not so clever

The truth will leak again
No matter what you spend
The truth will leak again
And it will stay until the end

Dirty little games
Proofs went up in flames
Try to save your ass
You can't keep it forever

Look what you have done
All that you have won
The price you'll have to pay
You're just not so clever

The truth will leak again
No matter how much you spend
The truth will leak again
And it will stay until the end

Disclosure is your fear
You feel the end is near
Try to gag your foes

You can't keep it forever
Justice will be done
You're not the only one
We will raise our voice
You're just not so clever

The truth will leak again
No matter what you spend
The truth will leak again
And it will stay until the end
