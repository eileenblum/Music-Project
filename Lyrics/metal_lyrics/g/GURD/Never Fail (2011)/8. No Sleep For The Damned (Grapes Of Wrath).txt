Lat ate night - lying awake
Can't get no sleep, can't get no sleep
Hear the bell striking twice
Can't find no peace, can't find no peace

What did I do
To earn this suffering

What is it that's keeping me
From slipping away, from slipping away
Late at night my mind just runs
I am awake, I am awake

All the misery I have gone through
Seems not enough
The damned gets no rest for sure
Reaping grapes of wrath

Only death will promise me
The well earned peace, the well earned peace
There's no ease for the pain
There'll be no cure, there'll be no cure

What did I do
to earn this suffering

All the misery I have gone through
Seems not enough
The damned gets no rest for sure
Reaping grapes of wrath

Will I ever fall asleep again
Or will I lay there with eyes open once more
There's no sleep for the damned in this world for sure
Only death will bring my well earned peace...
All my deeds hunting me forevermore
Was my life such a miserable piece of shit
Or am I punished for something done long before
No one else seems to feel the way I do
They can dream all their sorrows away
No one else has to suffer the way I do
My damnation is meant to stay
