[Music by Pat Mueller/Lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

Ask yourself what's real
Face it, what's the deal?
Tell me about your strain
And tell me about your gain

Why can you not just go away
Why don't you leave and go away
Make it a better place

I know you want to stay right there
You will not wise up
Disappear now without a trace

Suffer from your lies
Bet now, roll the dice
Will you ever learn?
Will you make the turn?

Why can you not just go away
Why don't you leave and go away
Make it a better place

I know you want to stay right there
You will not wise up
Disappear now without a trace

Better ask yourself
Yourself and no one else

Go ask!

Why can you not just go away
Why don't you leave and go away
Make it a better place

I know you want to stay right there
You will not wise up
Disappear now without a trace

Why don't you wise up
Come on wise up your mind
And show what's up your fuckin' brain
