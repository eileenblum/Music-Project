[Music &amp; lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

You gotta bang that head that doesn't bang
You gonna raise your fist into the air
You gotta bang that head that doesn't bang
Alright now, alright now

When you walk the streets, yeah
Everyday the same
Then they start to tease you
But you just don't care

You gotta bang that head that doesn't bang
You gonna raise your fist into the air
You gotta bang that head that doesn't bang
Alright now, alright now

Bang that head that doesn't bang
Raise your fist into the air
Bang that head that doesn't bang
Alright now, alright now

They think you're a loser
If they only knew
They think they can fool you
But you're way too cool

You gotta bang that head that doesn't bang
You gonna raise your fist into the air
You gotta bang that head that doesn't bang
Alright now, alright now

Bang that head that doesn't bang
Raise your fist into the air
Bang that head that doesn't bang
Alright now, alright now

Gonna set your face
You're gonna set your face
You're gonna set your face against
You're gonna set your face against them!
