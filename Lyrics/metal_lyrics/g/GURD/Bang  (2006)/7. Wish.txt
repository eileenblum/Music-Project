[Music &amp; lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

Going down now
Going down now
Going down now deep to the ground

Gotta say now
Gotta say now
Gotta say now what you want

Better go and watch yourself now
Better go and watch your back, man
Better leave this shit behind ya
Better watch the dark beside ya

You gotta wish today
You never wished yourself your sins away
You wanna wish today
So what you want from me
It's time to say

Feeling proud of ...
Feeling proud of ...
Feeling proud of what you did

You are there now
You are there now
You are there but you won't fit

Better think before you wish now
Better think before you speak, man
Better leave this shit behind ya
Better watch the dark beside ya

You gotta wish today
You never wished yourself your sins away
You wanna wish today
So what you want from me
It's time to say

In the end now
In the end now
In the end now when it's done

You're afraid now
You're afraid now
You're afraid of what will come

Better go and leave this place now
Better go and watch your back, man
Better leave this shit behind ya
Better watch the dark beside ya

You gotta wish today
You never wished yourself your sins away
You wanna wish today
So what you want from me
It's time to say
