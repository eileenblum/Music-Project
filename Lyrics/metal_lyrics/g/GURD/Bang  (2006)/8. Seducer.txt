[Music by Franky Winkelmann &amp; V.O. Pulver/Lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

You built your network around the world
You made your reign out of fear
You put our hopes right in the dirt
Until your victory's near

I will not follow you
I refuse anyway
I will not hold to you
I can quit any day
Just go and leave me alone

You try to lure me with all your shine
You promise heaven on earth
What's good is whatever you define
We have been sold from our birth

I will not follow you
I refuse anyway
I will not hold to you
I can quit any day
Just go and leave me alone

You try to seduce me
I will not resign
You think you can fool me
But not this time

Not this time
One big lie
Until I die
Hear my cry

Seducer! Polluter! Seducer!
Seducer! Polluter! Seducer!

I will not follow you
I refuse anyway
I will not hold to you
I can quit any day
Just go and leave me alone

You try to seduce me
I will not resign
You think you can fool me
But not this time

Not this time
One big lie
Until I die
Hear my cry
