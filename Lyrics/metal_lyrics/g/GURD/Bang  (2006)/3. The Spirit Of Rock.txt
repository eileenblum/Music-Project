[Music by Pat Mueller/Lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

Welcome into my world
Shall I show you how to play the game?
I got the shivers now
When I think of all the things to say

Bow down to the Gods of Rock
Never ask what you should do, oh no
You will be heard by them
Forget the shit you've done before

You don't have to be your inner slave
I will help to turn you upside down
And you will never be the same

Wake up and start to live
Never stop to lift it from your neck
We want to rock it now
So we start to get the engine go

Turn up and feel the heat
See the flames are rising high again
We keep the pace real high
Forget the shit you've done before

You don't have to be your inner slave
I will help to turn you upside down
And you will never be the same

We told you
This is all you got
We bless you
With the Spirit of Rock

You will never be the same
You will never be the same
You can never stay the same
If you choose to play the game

Play the game
Play the game
Never stay the same

You will never be the same
You will never be the same
You can never stay the same
If you choose to play the game

We told you
This is all you got
We bless you
With the Spirit of Rock
