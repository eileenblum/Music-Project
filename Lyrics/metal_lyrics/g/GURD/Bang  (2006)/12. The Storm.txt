[Music &amp; by V.O. Pulver]

Moving inwards
Coming closer
Bringing chaos over mankind

Strong and mighty
Devastating
Eating cities, taking man's life

Fear my power
My destruction
Hell on earth is what they call me

Ripping roofs off
Raging waters
I fulfill your evil nightmares

Die...

Revenge is mine
Won't hear your cries
Revenge is mine now

The storm is here
I'll come, you'll flee
The storm is here now

Mighty nature
Striking back now
I will conquer, you will suffer

Many warnings
I have gave you
Never ever did you listen

Fighting back now
Take what is mine
Teaching you to show me respect

No escaping
Death will follow
I will be alive forever

Die...

Revenge is mine
Won't hear your cries
Revenge is mine now

The storm is here
I'll come, you'll flee
The storm is here now
