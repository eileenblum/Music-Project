[Music by Pat Mueller/Lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

Feel a little bit odd today?
Feel a little bit hot today?
Gonna stay in bed today?
You'll never get on top this way

You're feeling down
It doesn't matter to you
This time again
Your indulgence helps to me you though

You're feeling blue
Tell me a reason
It doesn't matter to you
Tell me a reason
You know it's time
Tell me a reason
To get up and leave this place behind

Feel a little bit odd today?
Feel a little bit hot today?
Gonna stay in bed today?
You'll never get on top this way

Hey you, what's up with you?
Hey you, what you're going through?
Hate you, it's all you can
So get on your feet and break the ban

Come grab your prize
Get back your life
Deep down inside of you
You'll find the power to get you through

Deny your haze
Tell me a reason
Come down from space
Tell me reason
Get real and see
Tell me a reason
What your life could be without your drain?

Feel a little bit odd today?
Feel a little bit hot today?
Gonna stay in bed today?
You'll never get on top this way

Hey you, what's up with you?
Hey you, what you're going through?
Hate you, it's all you can
So get on your feet and break the ban

Break the ban!
