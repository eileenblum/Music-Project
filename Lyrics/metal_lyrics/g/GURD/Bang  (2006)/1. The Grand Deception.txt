[Music &amp; lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

They promised magic in your hands
Domination for you land
Only lies is what you've got

Far way is where they live
Came to earth inside their ships
Mesmerized you like a god

The grand deception
Is all what you have got so far
The grand deception
They took you soul and gave you war

Your DNA is what they want
Lost their souls with all their wars
Human kind is their relief

Playing tricks with all their might
Getting people in the night
It was a lie, they`ll never leave

The grand deception
Is all what you are lying for
The grand deception
They took you soul and gave you war

Without a doubt
They lied like this
It's all a fake
You did not miss
Technology
What they possess
It's nothing more as you can guess

Better prepare for your demise
They are the demons in disguise
They never did what they have told

You'll never find you higher self
They blinded you and you won't tell
Because the truth can't be unfold

The grand deception
Is all what you have got so far
The grand deception
They took you soul and gave you war
