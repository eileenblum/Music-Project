[Music by Pat Mueller/Lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

Your game, your rules, you win
No choice, just hope within
You will survive, you're shure
You will not lose, no more

Start your system now
Let the engines roar
Smell the gasoline
Let it go

Start your system now
Get yourself on track
Smell the gasoline
Let it roar

Keep on fighting, hey!
Keep on riding, hey!
Take it like a man
Can't get enough

Your game, your rules, you win
No choice, just hope within
You will survive, you're shure
You will not lose, no more

You are number one
You're the leader now
One more lap to go
Make it real

But your final turn
Makes your tire burn
See the wall right there
Crash! Boom! Bang!

Keep on fighting, hey!
Keep on riding, hey!
Take it like a man
Can't get enough

Your game, your rules, you win
No choice, just hope within
You will survive, you're shure
You will not lose, no more

You're gonna die
No need to cry

Take it like a man!
