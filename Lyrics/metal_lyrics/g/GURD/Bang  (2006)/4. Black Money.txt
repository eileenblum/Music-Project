[Music &amp; lyrics by V.O. Pulver]

Revolution in my mind
Only hate is left inside
Lost my hope and lost my dreams
Because of you and all your greed

You command whatever you like
Try your luck before you die
Reality you still deny
But in your dreams you see the truth

You black money
Your promises control the world

Your black money won't ease the pain
Will make us hurt

There's no way back now
It's all too late
We can't go back now
It's all too late
You made your choice now
It's all too late
We follow you know
It's all too late

We have sold our freedom to live
Became our worst enemy
Nothing saves us from ourselves
But we will still deny our souls

You will lie to keep us down
You will lie to keep your crown
Will you ever let us go?
Or will you stand and let us fall?

You black money
Your promises control the world

Your black money won't ease the pain
Will make us hurt

There's no way back now
It's all too late
We can't go back now
It's all too late
You made your choice now
It's all too late
We follow you know
It's all too late
