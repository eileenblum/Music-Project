I DON'T WONDER ANYMORE
WATCH THE NEWS AND KNOW THE SCORE
ARMAGEDDON EVERYDAY
NEW WORLD ORDER'S HERE TO STAY

NEVER TRUST YOU - NEVER ASKED FOR
YOU DO IT AGAIN
YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

HEY THERE - STOP
ANYONE CAN HEAR ME
HEY THERE - STOP
I GIVE YOU A REASON TO FEAR ME

SECRET LODGES RULING US
WE WILL NEVER FIND THE CAUSE
GOLDEN AGE IS WHAT THEY PREACH
DIDN'T TELL US HOW TO REACH

NEVER TRUST YOU - NEVER ASKED FOR
YOU DO IT AGAIN
YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

HEY THERE - STOP
ANYONE CAN HEAR ME
HEY THERE - STOP
I GIVE YOU A REASON TO FEAR ME

NEVER ASKED FOR IT ANYWAY
NEVER TRUST YOU AT ANYTIME

ALL I WANT - ALL I NEED
YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN - IS ALL THAT I FEEL

I NEVER ASKED FOR YOU
I NEVER TRUSTED YOU
