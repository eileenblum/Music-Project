Come tell me
Who's the one to pay me for your lies
Nevertheless you caught me by surprise
Survey your work is a bitter pill to take
Material world - what a big fat ugly fake

Go-Go
Ugly fake

I've got to

Change everything besides the one I want
Object to serve your way of having 'fun'
Gonna feel the day getting closer anyway
The day you're trapped in your selfdigged big ass grave

Big ass grave-Who's the slave

I will shed no tears - I will shed no tears
I will shed no tears for all these wasted years

I will shed no
I will shed no tears
I will shed no

You've got to
Stop this now - a better time has come
Your kind is dead and now you're all alone
Gonna feel the day getting closer anyway
The day you're trapped in your selfdigged big ass grave

Call me freak
Call me freak
If this is what you need
