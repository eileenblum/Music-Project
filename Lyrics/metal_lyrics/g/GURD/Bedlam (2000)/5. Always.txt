I WANT IT - WHAT YOU HIDE FROM ME
I CALL IT - SO COME ON SET IT FREE
DRIVEN BY ANGER - MY ONLY MOTIVATION
NEVER SURRENDER - THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE

IT HAD TO BE

COME CLOSER - LET ME TASTE YOUR FEAR
KINDA COSMIC - WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE
DRIVEN BY ANGER - THE HATE INSIDE OF ME
BETTER SUSPENDED - THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE

ALWAYS
IT HAD TO BE
ALWAYS
THE WAY IT HAD TO BE

COME A LITTLE CLOSER
COME A LITTLE CLOSER NOW
LET ME TASTE YOUR FEAR...

I WANT IT - WHAT YOU HIDE FROM ME
I CALL IT - SO COME ON SET IT FREE
DRIVEN BY ANGER - MY ONLY MOTIVATION
NEVER SURRENDER - THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE

ALWAYS
IT HAD TO BE
ALWAYS
THE WAY IT HAD TO BE
