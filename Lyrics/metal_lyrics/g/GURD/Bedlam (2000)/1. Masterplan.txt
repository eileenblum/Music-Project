Facing the truth bout your fucking life
Think it's better when you're dead
Shitass perspective from the bottom line
Gotta stop to live in dread

Fear fills your head - what an empty place
Have to stop it soon
There must have been a reason
There must have been a reason
A reason for you, too

No matter what you say
No matter what you do
You gotta see the light
Shining bright inside of you
Believe inside of me
Believe inside of you
The wheel of life will turn forever

God only knows what you are waiting for
Accept your state of mind
Goddamn religion - the biggest whore
Close your eyes and look inside

Science searching for the final answer
Will they ever see
Plan of life - inside of us
Forever it will be

This is the masterplan
Never changing - never changing
This is the masterplan
Time you're spending - neverending
