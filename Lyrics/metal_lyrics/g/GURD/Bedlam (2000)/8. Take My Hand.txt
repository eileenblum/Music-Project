You will be a part of my life
You'll give me the right to die

Exhausted from growing old
Too late my head gets bold

I will show you the world outside
Come take my hand
I will show you their pain and pride
Come take my

The future - whatever it brings
Clearness to people who think
You'll make your way out to the light
You're gonna see the turn of the tide

I will show you the world outside
Come take my hand
I will show you their hate and lies
Come take my hand

I wonder why you chose this world
I wonder why you chose this world

Come take my hand
