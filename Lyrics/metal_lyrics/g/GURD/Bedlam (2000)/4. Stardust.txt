Vision - creeps in my head
taking my soul to a higher ground
Anger - resist my pain
making me high to bring me down
Violence - deep in my veins
and what you sow is what you'll get
Ending - just wait and see
and you will use your damn regrets

Stardust falls from the sky
Gave us the reason why
Stardust falls from the sky
Brings us to sleep tonight

Feel it - the more you fight
the more you start to lose your mind
Taste it - the bitterness
gets all inside and lets you die
Power - is in the air
and then the night will turn to day
Warning - for us to see
Maybe we stop our own decay

Get on your feet - Get on your feet
Get on your feet
Do what it needs - Do what it needs
Do what it needs

Fire - in the sky
Fire - burns so bright
