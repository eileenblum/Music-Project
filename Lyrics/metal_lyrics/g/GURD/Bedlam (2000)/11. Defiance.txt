Tickin' time bomb - fear to release
Ablaze my hate - you gotta steer clear
Gonna take my time
Gonna do my best
To straighten out this fuckin' mess

I just ask myself
Won't you go to hell

Defiance
De- De- Defiance
To your damn violence
De- De- Defiance

Poison my soul with your appearance
So use your fuckin' ears to hear me
Gonna draw the line
Gonna change your mind
To straighten out this wasted time

I just ask myself
Won't you go to hell

Defiance
De- De- Defiance
To your damn violence
De- De- Defiance

Gonna draw the line
Gonna change your mind

If this is what you need
