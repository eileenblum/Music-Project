Wanna bite the hand that feeds me
Wanna turn the tides
Set the demons free and let them fly
Strike down the one who leads me
I'm gonna take his place
Gonna vindicate the human race

You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine

Take the reins of power
And seize them
Draw the battle lines
Armageddon's just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason
Let the arrows fly
Your freedom's just a state of mind

Better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine

You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
I'm a war machine
I'm a war machine
