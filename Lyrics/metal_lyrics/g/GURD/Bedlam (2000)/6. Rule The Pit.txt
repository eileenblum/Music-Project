Get on the go
Over and done
Enter the pit - Energy filling your head

Wrecking the neck - bound to collapse
Music's cranking up loud
Over and out - final command
Fist in the air and we shout

Faces of pain
On the attack
Got to explode - Maximum tension arrives

Wrecking the neck - bound to collapse
Music's cranking up loud
Over and out - final command
Fist in the air and we shout

Rule the pit
Sweat and spit
Rule the pit
We will kick this shit

Thrashing your head
Move to the sound
Aggression released - Never will come to an end

Wrecking the neck - bound to collapse
Music's cranking up loud
Over and out - final command
Fist in the air and we shout

Rule the pit
Sweat and spit
Rule the pit
We will kick this shit

RULE!
