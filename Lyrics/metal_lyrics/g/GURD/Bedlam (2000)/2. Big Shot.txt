Driving up in a big limousine
You show you're rich what a hell of a dream
You'll gonna kick it up you wanna reach the top
Just being son - it pays a lot

So this is your dream
Not bad how it seems
Your loneliness is what I see
Gonna show you down to the ground
You'll never gonna make it out

You loser
Get a life

Big shot - showing off your money
Big shot - why you look at me
Big shot - not impressed at all
Baby I don't care - Baby I don't care

Ain't you aware of reality
So fucking dumb or just so mean?
Ain't gonna say a single word to you
To me you look like the biggest fool

Got all of your money
Got all of your fame
But life is lost without a brain
Gonna show you down to the ground
Your fucking lies are all around

You loser
Get a life

Big shot..
