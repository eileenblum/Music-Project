YOU SAID YOU HELP ME
WHEN I ASK FOR IT
YOU'VE TRIED TO BREAK ME
I FIGHT BACK INSTEAD
WHEN WILL YOU LEAVE ME
WHEN WILL YOU SET ME FREE
YOU CAN BELIEVE ME
I JUST FIXED MY HEAD

I WILL NOT LIVE - I WILL NOT DIE
MY LIFE'S JUST WASTED
YOU CANNOT HELP - YOU CANNOT HEAL
SO WHY YOU'RE WAITING
YOU'RE WAY TOO LATE - YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR
NO PILLS WILL TREAT ME
ESCAPE FROM HERE - IS ALL I WANT
YOU CANNOT BREAK ME

I FEEL THE FLAME
BURNING IN MY HEAD
I'M NOT INSANE
AND SOON I'LL BE DEAD

MY LOONY INMATES
OH I FEEL FOR YOU
CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT
WHY THEY FEEL SO BLUE
DON'T WANNA STAY HERE
GOT TO GET AWAY
YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME
I AM NOT INSANE

I WILL NOT LIVE - I WILL NOT DIE
MY LIFE'S JUST WASTED
ESCAPE FROM HERE - IS ALL I WANT
