Did you ever reflect it
Did you think about fear
Did you ever respect it
Now that judgement is near

'Cause now your time has come
They're on your tail
Don't you wait too long
See that you've failed

Caught
You're gettin' caught
Gettin' caught
You're gettin' caught

All the things you have done now
All the things you will do
Are you glad, are you proud now
Feels like heaven to you

But now your time has come
They're on your tail
Don't you wait too long
See that you've failed

Caught
You're gettin' caught
Gettin' caught
You're gettin' caught

No more hatred and no more fear
No more hatred, your judgement's here
