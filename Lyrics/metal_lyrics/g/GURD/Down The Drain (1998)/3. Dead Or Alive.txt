I've got to face the facts
'Cause not it's all too late
I've got to shiver and shake
They want me to protect them
From the danger I am
From the danger I'll be
I don't wanna give them my sympathy

I am the wicked one

So I wanna try to stay away
I got no time to waste here anyway
From the east to the west
From the south to the north
They're looking for me
Each day they want me more

They want me
Dead or alive, dead or alive
They need me
Dead or alive, dead or alive

Got this feelingÂ
What's the meaning?
