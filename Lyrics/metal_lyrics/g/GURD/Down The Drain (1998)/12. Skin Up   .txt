This week makes you happy
That weed makes you strong
This weed makes you groovin'
And it will gonna do it all nite long

This weed makes you thinkin'
That week lifts you up
This weed means just heaven
But this shit is so heavy it never stops

Skin up
Skin up
I want to party the whole nite long
Skin up
I wanna smoke 'til the daylight comes

This weed smells like summer
That weed smells like pot
This weed pulls me under
But that's the reason I smoke a lot

This weed helps you flyin'
That weed brings you down
This weed makes you cryin'
And you won't recognize the world around

Skin up
Skin up
I want to party the whole nite long
Skin up
I wanna smoke 'til the daylight comes

I wish I could fly
I feel I'm so high
