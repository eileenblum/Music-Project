Oh I never forgive you
For what you've done to me
Oh I never forget you
Just wait and you will see

All I ever wanted
You took away from me
All I ever wanted
Not much that I would need

I go down the drain
Can't stand the pain
I wish I'm dead before I go insane
'Cause
I go down the drain
Go down the drain

Oh now I hate you
For just the way you are
Oh now I hate you
You think you are a star

All I ever wanted
You took away from me
All I ever wanted
Not much that I would need

I go down the drain
Can't stand the pain
I wish I'm dead before I go insane
'Cause
I go down the drain
Go down the drain
