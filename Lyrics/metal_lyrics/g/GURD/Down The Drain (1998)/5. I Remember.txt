In a time long ago
There was another place
This world I'm dreaming of
Home of the human race

I remember
I remember
How it used to
How it used to be

Fate went it's bitter way
No way for us to stay
It's sad we had no choice
We did not hear the voice

I see the mountains high
I see the rivers passin' by
I see the birds fly high
I see white clouds up in the sky
I see the grass so green
I see the things I've never seen
I feel so good
I feel so good
I never knew I ever would

I remember
I remember
How it used to
How it used to be

Everytime I see the dirt around myself,
I try to think of the times we used to
Be in this place

I remember now
