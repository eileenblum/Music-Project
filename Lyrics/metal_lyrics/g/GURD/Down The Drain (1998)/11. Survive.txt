I am immortal
My fire never ends
I am immortal
I never will forget

I am your sorrow
So don't you try to lie
I am your sorrow
I always will survive

Survive, I always will survive

I am your hatred
I take away your sleep
I am your hatred
'Cause I know what you need

I give you anger
To take away your pain
I give you anger
So you know who's to blame

I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
You'll never see me die
