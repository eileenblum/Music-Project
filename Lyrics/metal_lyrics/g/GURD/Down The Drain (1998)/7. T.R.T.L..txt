Insane it's insane
What is trapped in my brain
I'm about to lose control
I'm about to be no more

This cannot be true
That I'm going to do
Once again what can take your
Fucking mind but you don't know

The reason to live
Is the reason to die
If you have to be undead
Nothing better - Kill yourself

Just cannot find the key
Which could make me really free
I am losing all my thoughts
Realizing that I'm caught

No way out
I am your only friend
No way to
Escape from no man's land

Is it your aim
Just to fuck up your brain
Only for the seven seconds
You come crawling back to me
