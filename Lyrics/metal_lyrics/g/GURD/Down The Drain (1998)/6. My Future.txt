Get what you need today
Get on your feet and play
Never gonna give it away
I'm gonna try to stay

All what I try to do
What I try to prove
Never gonna listen to you
Tell me now who's the fool

My future lies inside of me
My eyes are closed but I can see
What you can take away from me
Is not the thing I want to keep

I do what I like
Do what is right
I never needed a sign
All what I need is time

Step out of the line
And start feeling fine
Stop committing the crime
Won't you stop being so blind

My future lies inside of me
My eyes are closed but I can see
What you can take away from me
Is not the thing I want to keep
My future
My future
My future lies inside of me

Come and see what I create
Take your chance it's not too late
