Can I rethink my problem
I need more time
See this big black hole inside me
Makes me wanna cry

Can I just see the impact
Of what we do
Feel it's wrong from deep inside me
It's nothing new

Won't you help me
Won't you help me
I don't mind if you help me
And I'm allright if you help me

All what the people sayin'
Won't work for me
If you knew what I have tried
You would agree

All what the people told me
I keep away
All the crazy shit behind me
So what you say

Won't you help me
Won't you help me
I don't mind if you help me
And I'm allright if you help me
