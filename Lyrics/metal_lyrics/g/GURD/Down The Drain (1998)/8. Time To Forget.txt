I think it's all a lie to me
Will I ever forget
I see people around of me
Do they ever regret

I think it's time
To forget
I think it's time
To catch my breath

Wish you could have helped me
To forget
To forget all the pain that I feel
That I feel inside of me
Deep inside of me

What I feel is a bitter pain
I don't know what to do
What I see is another stain
Makes me sicker of you

All the hatred inside of me
Makes me sick to the bone
Once you've seen what you really need
(You) know you're never alone

I think it's time
To forget
I think it's time
To catch my breath

Wish you could have helped me
I think it's time
To forget
I think it's time
I think it's time
That I feel inside of me
I think it's time
Deep inside of me
