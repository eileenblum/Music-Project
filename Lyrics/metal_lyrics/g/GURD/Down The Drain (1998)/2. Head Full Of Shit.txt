Inside your head what an empty space
You're born to lose
With this ugly face
Pretend you're dead
Then you're better of
I am the one you are dreaming of

Give it up
I say
Give it up
I pray
Won't you stop
I say
Won't you stop

You got your
Head full of shit
You got your
You got your head full of shit
Head full of shit
I'm not your
I'm not your mom and this is it

Looking at you and your funny pride
You make my day and you make my night
I'd rather go before I laugh
I look at you from far above

Give it up
I say
Give it up
I pray
Won't you stop
I say
Won't you stop

You got your
Head full of shit
You got your
You got your head full of shit
Head full of shit
I'm not your
I'm not your mom and this is it

Head full of shit
You got your
Head full of shit
Your head is full of shit
