Keep on searchin'
The truth is where it ends
Keep on learnin'
And nothing you'll repent

Ain't gonna bow my head down
Ain't gonna bow my head
Ain't gonna bow my head down
Ain't gonna bow my head

No way to break my will
Ain't gonna shoot to kill
No way to break my will
Don't need your fucking thrill

Live is easy
As long as you enjoy
Don't you tease me
'Coz I am not your boy

Ain't gonna bow my head down
Ain't gonna bow my head
Ain't gonna bow my head down
Ain't gonna bow my head

No, never
