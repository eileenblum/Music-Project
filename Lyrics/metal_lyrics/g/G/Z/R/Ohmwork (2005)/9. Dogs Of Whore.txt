Give itâ¦
Why donât you, give itâ¦
You hold it all, all for yourself
Your time you waste
On no one else
Why donât you give me the lies of you
Never mind cause I donât really like you

It takes one man, to start a war
One tainted dollar bill
To turn a lover to whore
Why donât you open your eyes itâs you
Never mind cause I donât really like you

[Chorus:]
I live among the world with emptiness I try to hide
Alone I fight the hate that lives inside, itâs time to die

[Middle:]
Lies, just tell me lies, these lies of you
Never mind cause I donât really like you [Repeat]
We are the children of God, Jesus is our brother
We become one family, when we are baptized

Give itâ¦
Why donât you, give itâ¦
You hold it all, all for yourself
Your time you waste
On no one else
Why donât you give me the lies of you
Never mind cause I donât really like you

[Chorus]
