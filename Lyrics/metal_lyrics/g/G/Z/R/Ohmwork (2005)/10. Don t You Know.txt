Donât you know what you mean to me
You see me in the darkness
The unforgiving loneliness

Donât you knowâ¦
You see me in my helpless hour

Donât you knowâ¦
Iâm living here in darkness
The unavading loneliness

Donât you knowâ¦
Iâm living in my helpless hour

Canât you wait just another day
Iâm trying to make it through this
Abyss of loneliness

Canât you waitâ¦
Itâs taking all of my power

Canât you waitâ¦
Iâm dying to get through this
The unavading loneliness

Canât you waitâ¦
The situation is now dire

[Pre Chorus:]
You gotta believe in me
You have to
You gotta believe in me
Because

[Chorus:]
Iâm waiting, surrounded so alone
Iâm waiting, outside the comfort zone
Iâm waiting, where all my thoughts are sewn
Surrounded, yet so alone

[Middle:]
Every day, itâs the same living in the hours of the hate
I display and itâs taking over

Donât you know what you mean to me
I need you in the darkness
To empathize my loneliness

Donât you knowâ¦
Iâm dying in my helpless hour

Donât you knowâ¦
Take away the darkness and give me back my happiness

Donât you knowâ¦.
And aid me in my helpless hour

[Chorus]
