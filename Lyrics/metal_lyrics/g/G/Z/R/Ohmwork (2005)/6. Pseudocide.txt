Simply there
A reflection of someone that you made
But itâs like the one, like the one you trust,
Like the one you know
Itâs all made up by you

[Pre Chorus:]
Force fed, man made

Pseudocide
This is created by the fuel to be fired in the mind to kill everything
You are now extinct
Exempt to become someone else, soâ¦

[Pre-Chorus:]
Force fed, man made, so fake

[Chorus:]
Pseudocide

Cannot hide from the ones that know of your plan
Were not like the ones, like the ones you fooled
Like the ones you must, you impress, so hopeless

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Simply there
A reflection of someone that you made
But itâs like the one, like the one you trust,
Like the one you know
Itâs all made up by you
