Pardon my depression, my mindâs in recession
Compulsion for confession, itâs my soulâs obsession
Hey, Iâm falling apart today
Yeah, Yeah, Iâm falling apart
[Repeat]

Pardon my intrusion, I need a truth infusion
My life is just illusion, pardon my intrusion
Hey, Iâm falling apart today
Yeah, yeah, Iâm falling apart
[Repeat]

[Chorus:]
Iâve got nothing to say to you
Except that I am confused
Iâve got nothing to say to you
Except that I am so used

Pardon my aggression, my symbol of oppression
My only indiscretion, itâs my last transgression
Hey, Iâm falling apart today
Yeah, yeah, Iâm falling apart
[Repeat]
