Mother, you are the entity
You are the figure head
Of my insanity
Father, you are the criminoid
False possessor of my life
And suicide
Brother, you are the subliside
Your reign of hate will now only emplify
All on, your hated company
My only ties to you now have gone and died
Play on without your company
I donât need to be him
Iâve just gotta be
All on, an ancient memory
I sold this soul out to all my enemies

[Chorus:]
You gotta drown yourself in shit
And find a fucking face that fits
Masturbate some self control
And tell the world to save your soul

All on, a hated memory
You can take back all of your sympathy
Play on, and moving toward the end
A negative light that I call my friend
Stay on, the road that all you made
The faces of light, now they start to fade
Hate on, itâs what it has to be
I donât need to be him, I just need to be me

[Chorus]

[Middle:]
Fly on, fly on to save the world
Now Iâve got you in my hands
And I am leaving, leaning on another
Iâm relearning with new eyes

Mother, you are the entity
You are the figure head
Of my insanity
Father, you are the criminoid
False possessor of my life
And suicide
Brother, you are the subliside
Your reign of hate will now only emplify
All on, your hated company
My only ties to you now have gone and died
Play on without your company
I donât need to be him
Iâve just gotta be
All on, an ancient memory
I sold this soul out to all my enemies

[Chorus]
[Middle]

All on a hated memory
