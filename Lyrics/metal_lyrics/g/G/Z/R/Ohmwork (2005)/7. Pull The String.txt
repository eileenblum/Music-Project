Pull the string, itâs a ravenous thought
A ridiculous plot
Brought on by the enemies
Full disgrace, all which is bought by all of you
Full disgrace, all which is bought by all of you
Empty race, need a leader, not a criminal mind
Who is blind to the anarchy in life
Such a waste, all which is bought by all of you
Such a waste, all which is bought by all of you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Unfit, overpaid, unfit, got it made

[Chorus:]
I know youâre so unclean
Iâll never trust you again
Sympathy that I wonât make
Stay away and just decay
Iâll never trust you again

Pull the string, yeah, Iâm angry and lost
A ridiculous plot
Brought on by the enemy
Full disgrace, all which is bought by all of you
Full disgrace, all which is bought by all of you
Human race, we are told to rely on the lies
That supply all the empathy and cries
Enemies, all of which were taught by all of you
Enemies, all of which were taught by all of you

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Middle:]
I did it all and I gave it all and I did it all
Thatâs why Iâm ruined
Thatâs why Iâm ruined
Thatâs why Iâm finished
