I believe weâll win, I believe the soul
Believe I am, in the control
To start again
I believe the wind, I believe the soul,
Believe I am, in the control
To start again

[Chorus:]
Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in someone
Like it or not
Take it away
You gotta believe in something

So you make the change, make the change that would
Be embraced on the side of good
I believe in sin, cause I think it could
Be the hand that holds the world

[Chorus]

[Middle:]
God held me and told me you fight your enemies
Donât let them make your end, youâll make everything
The way it has to be
God held me

Youâre living through, youâre living through and fighting
I believe weâll win, I believe it all
Believe I am, in the control
