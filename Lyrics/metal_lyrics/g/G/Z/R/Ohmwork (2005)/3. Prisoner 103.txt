Prisoner 103
Awakened by the onslaught
Of patient and low electrical hum
Sounds that are based
On just a little bit of poetry that sits on a low voice
Prisoner 103
Is taken on a journey
A basic regression of practical thought
And stolen his taste and the memory of all the things that make
The most sense

[Chorus:]
What do you want
What do you need
How do you feel when youâre dying
What do you want
What do you need
How does it feel to be stolen
(Open your mind)

Blaming it all on me
Iâm making all the inner talk
Of insane mechanical satanical fun
Sounds that are laced
Through a portal of immortal light and energy
Thatâs right, the undead
Blaming it all on me
Your sanctioned to a faction
That takes up and makes up
Eternal wisdom
Life that is based
On a spec of a rejected vision
Itâs what it all means

[Chorus]

[Middle:]
Take it out on me
And I will break your head in two
Take it out on me
I will slowly control you
And then Iâll own you
Take it out on me
And I will break your head in two

[Chorus]

Prisoner 103
Awakened by the onslaught
Of patient and low electrical hum
Sounds that are based
On just a little bit of poetry that sits on a low voice
Prisoner 103
Is taken on a journey
A basic regression of practical thought
And stolen his taste and the memory of all the things that make
The most sense
