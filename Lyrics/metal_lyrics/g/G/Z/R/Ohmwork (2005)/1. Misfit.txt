This whole wide world Iâve traveled
Iâve seen the sins of other men
The secrets that Iâve unraveled
Theyâve made me who I am today

[Pre-Chorus:]
The one who sold out all of my dreams
Can you tell me what this all did mean

When the whole world has fallen
I will be living in a dream
The claims of war and poverty
They are holding you and me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Low, how far can we push this
Own, run my life like a misfit
Hate, Iâve grown to live my life by this word
Take, Iâm taking none of your lies anymore

[Middle:]
Low, Own, Hate, Take

[Chorus]

[Third verse is the same as the first]

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
