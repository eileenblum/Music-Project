Lights go out
I feel a presence in the room
The evil grows
ElvisÂ´ singing on the radio
Acid hair
From Memphis Tennessee
This is the man
The Legend known as Elvis Presley.

Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, evil Elvis Presley.
Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, evil Elvis Presley.

The KingÂ´s alive
I see him everywhere I go
Suspicious mind
Elvis living in my video
Classic hair
The son of Mrs. Hippy Sam,
This is the man,
Possessed by Elvis Aaron Presley

Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, evil Elvis Presley.
Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, evil Elvis Presley.

[Repeat 1st Verse]

Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, evil Elvis Presley.
Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, evil Elvis Presley.
Repeat verse

Oh, Elvis do you love me Oh, Evil.
