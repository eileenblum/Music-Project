Take me back to the memories
Of the insane way that things used to be
Out of all the times I said "IÂ´m fine"
I wasnÂ´t always wrong I was just used
Taken, IÂ´m led
Taken, IÂ´m led

Taken from and led away from hope (Severed...)
And I was held back from the chance (Severed...)
To do my own
Taken from and led away from hope (Severed...)
And I was held back from the chance (Severed...)
To do my own

Tell me why it has to be
Living deep inside it eats away at me
Now I know it remains, it always speaks my name
Why does it have to feel like I was raped
Taken, IÂ´m led
Taken, IÂ´m led

Taken from and led away from hope (Severed...)
And I was held back from the chance (Severed...)
To do my own
Taken from and led away from hope (Severed...)
And I was held back from the chance (Severed...)
To do my own

I wait for you, come to me
Hate fills the hole inside
Now that I know how to hold this ground
Maybe I wonÂ´t have to be so led.
Taken, IÂ´m led
Taken, IÂ´m led

Taken from and led away from hope (Severed...)
And I was held back from the chance (Severed...)
To do my own
Taken from and led away from hope (Severed...)
And I was held back from the chance (Severed...)
To do my own

[Repeat Verse]
