Ice cold killer brings DeathÂ´s sweet darkness
Close my eyes, say a last farewell
Who, now who forgot my angry side
IÂ´ll return by starlight
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground

Saint of shades fills my clone with Spook Songs
Who, now who can blame my angry side
IÂ´ll return by twilight
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground

Dead among the Cybermen
Dead among the Cybermen...
Cybermen

Robots sanction my extreme unction
Clockwork ciphers delete my soul
Who, now who forgot my angry side
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground
Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen
How long can they keep him underground

Tell me who lies dead among the Cybermen.
