Scene from a flickering corner of life:
A boy, who went and got himself lost.
SheÂ´s there, walking right in his shadow,
The woman, whose path he should have crossed.

The light Shines on her
I burst into flames

A case of Northern Wisdom filters my eyes
Embrace the light as mother sighs
I feel a Southern breeze ignite my soul
And out of time and space, I lose control

SheÂ´s there walking right in his shadow
The woman whose path he should have crossed

The light Shines on her
I burst into flames

A case of Northern Wisdom filters my eyes
Embrace the light as mother sighs
I feel a Southern breeze ignite my soul
And out of time and space, I lose control

Looking for answers in my head
Left between what could and should have been, Instead.

A case of Northern Wisdom filters my eyes
Embrace the light as mother sighs
I feel a Southern breeze ignite my soul
And out of time and space, I lose control
