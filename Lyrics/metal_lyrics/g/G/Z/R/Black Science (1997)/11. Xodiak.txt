Steve, Steven Xodiak
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t never coming back

Screenage Cyberspaceman
A Psychic to the stars
He liked to scan their fortune
And read their Tarot cards
But then one day a stranger
Took him by surprise

Steve, Steven Xodiak
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t never coming back
Screenage psychopath
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t ever coming back

She said she wants to be a god
An angel dressed in flares
She hacked away his future
And then she threw him down the stairs
Now SteveÂ´s a real spaceman
He lives up in the stars.

Steve, Steven Xodiak
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t never coming back
Screenage psychopath
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t ever coming back

From Ectoplasm City
Consulting from afar
Steven tells your fortune
DonÂ´t need no Tarot cards
Just call the Sci-Kick Network
On 1-900-M.A.R.S.

Steve, Steven Xodiak
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t never coming back
Screenage psychopath
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t ever coming back
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t ever coming back
He ainÂ´t never coming, he ainÂ´t ever coming back.
