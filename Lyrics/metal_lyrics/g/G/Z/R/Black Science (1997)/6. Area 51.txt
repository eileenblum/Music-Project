Area Code 51
Groom Lake I spy upon
I hear them lying in my head
Dreamland is not a dream
This place not what it seems
I hear them lying in my head.

The Aliens are coming
And the World is succumbing
Flying Saucers have landed on Earth
The Invasion is coming

Here we are all around you, no time to hide
The Truth is out there
Here we are all around you, no time to hide

Area Code 51
Groom Lake IÂ´ll die upon
I hear them flying in my head
No where for me to hide
Beneath electric skies
TheyÂ´re here and flying in my head

The Aliens are coming
And the World is succumbing
Flying Saucers have landed on Earth
The Invasion is coming.

The Aliens are coming
I can see them coming
The Aliens are coming.
The Aliens are coming
I can see them coming
The Aliens are coming.

[Repeat Verse]

[Repeat 1st and 2nd Verse]

Here we are all around you, no time to hide
The Truth is out there
Here we are all around you, no time to hide (The Aliens are coming...)

Area Code 51
I hear them Lake I spy upon
I hear the invasion has begun
I hear them flying in my head
I hear them
Area Code 51
I hear them Lake I spy upon
I hear the invasion has begun
I hear them flying in my head
I hear them...
I hear them...
I hear them...
I hear them...
