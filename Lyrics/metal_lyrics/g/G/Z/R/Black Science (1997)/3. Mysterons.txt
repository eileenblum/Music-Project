When signals echo in the air
HeÂ´ll leave the world behind
In darkened places everywhere
The men in black prepare

At night he sits and waits
Alone he contemplates
The future of his universe

Assassin with a gun
He wants to be the one
To terminate the Scarlet curse

Communication One
The mission has begun
ItÂ´s time to kill or run
Is someone out there?
When signals echo in the air
HeÂ´ll leave the world behind
In darkened places everywhere
The men in black prepare

Inside the vortex state
No time to isolate
Manipulation of the minds

The power to resist
This force does not exist
Assured destruction is assigned.
