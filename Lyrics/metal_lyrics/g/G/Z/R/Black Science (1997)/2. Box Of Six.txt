Violent filthy kids full of dope
Take off your mind, stand in line
Spiral time I feed your bone, phone
Call the Beast, then call a priest
Need a fix, Box of Six.
(You and me the ultimate ghost)
So something inside, it canÂ´t be denied
It touches deep no matter what you say
Something inside Mechanical Bride
I still believe no matter what you say.

Silent silver pigs
Meet the ghost from the coast
Think IÂ´m blind to your sign
Get thee behind me...
What you see can never be
Meet the chix, Box of Six.
(Haunted by the ultimate ghost)
So something inside, it canÂ´t be denied
It touches deep no matter what you say
Something inside Mechanical Bride
I still believe no matter what you say.

So violent filthy kids full of dope
Take off your mind
Think IÂ´m blind to your sign
Get thee behind me...
Call the Beast, then call a priest
Need a fix, Box of Six.
Box of Six. Need a fix. Box of Six.
So something inside, it canÂ´t be denied
It touches deep no matter what you say
Something inside Mechanical Bride
I still believe no matter what you say.
(Superman, the ultimate ghost)
(Lucifer, the ultimate ghost)
(Jesus C., the ultimate ghost)
(C.Q.D., the ultimate ghost).
