Relax, breathe slow,
Enter space where only I go
Familiar place, where image bleeds,
The one dream never repeats
Where I reign
My arms wide
It takes away my sadness
To motivate and give new life
I fly so far away to space
I feel it healing

At night when I sleep,
Float away into worlds that keep
My hopes, a fantasy
Of the places IÂ´d like to be
Where I reign
My arms wide
It takes away my sadness (It takes away my sadness)
To motivate and give new life (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
I fly so far away to space (To motivate and give new life)
I feel it healing (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)

It takes away my sadness
To motivate and give new life
I fly so far away to space
I feel it healing (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)

I see a light, it follows me
Looking down and around to find out
From where it comes, a mystery
Of a thousand times IÂ´ve seen.
It takes away my sadness
To motivate and give new life
I fly so far away to space
I feel it healing
It takes away my sadness (It takes away my sadness)
To motivate and give new life (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
I fly so far away to space (To motivate and give new life)
I feel it healing (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
It takes away my sadness (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
To motivate and give new life (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
I fly so far away to space (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
I feel it healing (IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right)
IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right
IÂ´m justified and itÂ´s right.
