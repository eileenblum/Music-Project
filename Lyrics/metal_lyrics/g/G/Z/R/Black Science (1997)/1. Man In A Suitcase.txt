I wanna be like the man in a suitcase
Every day another new place
Gonna walk around like an action man
Keep my life in a nice leather black box
Everywhere I hear my songs on the jukebox
Gonna be like a man with the ultimate plan.
The man in a suitcase
He ainÂ´t like you
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah
The man in a suitcase
HeÂ´s too good to be true
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah.
I believe in a man with the suitcase
Every day meet another new face
Wanna drive around town in a new machine
I want to be like the man in a suitcase
Got to have his elastic face
Could I be just like him for one day.
The man in a suitcase
He ainÂ´t like you
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah
The man in a suitcase
HeÂ´s too good to be true
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah.
HeÂ´s like me and you
HeÂ´s like me and you
HeÂ´s like me and you
HeÂ´s like me and you.
I wanna be like the man in a suitcase
Every day another new place
Gonna walk around like an action man
Keep my life in a nice leather black box
Everywhere I hear my songs on the jukebox
Gonna be like a man with the ultimate plan.
The man in a suitcase
He ainÂ´t like you
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah
The man in a suitcase
HeÂ´s too good to be true
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah.
The man in a suitcase
He ainÂ´t like you
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah
The man in a suitcase
HeÂ´s too good to be true
He ainÂ´t like me and you, yeah, yeah.
I wanna be like the man in a suitcase
I believe in a man with the suitcase
I wanna be like the man in a suitcase
I believe in a man with the suitcase.
