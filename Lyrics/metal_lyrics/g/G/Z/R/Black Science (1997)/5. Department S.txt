We are the Undertaker,
The Social Breaker
Make you swim or sink,
Bounce your brains, make you think
Devil wears our Sunday boots
Phantom soldiers stop to shoot
Smiling as they execute
While we talk politics, politics
Dirty tricks that makes you sick
Never get sunny days in the Boston Green
The sky is never blue, itÂ´s freezing
Never get sunny days in the Boston Green
The sky is never blue, itÂ´s freezing

We are the violators,
Excommunicators
Never stop to think,
Wear the colours, blood for ink
Devil shares but never shoots
No surrender for our roots
Do or die, no substitutes
While we talk politics
Never get sunny days in the Boston Green
The sky is never blue, itÂ´s freezing
Never get sunny days in the Boston Green
The sky is never blue, itÂ´s freezing
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.

We are the Undertaker,
The Social Breaker
Make you swim or sink,
Bounce your brains, make you think
Devil wears our Sunday boots
Phantom soldiers stop to shoot
Smiling as they execute
While we talk politics
Never get sunny days in the Boston Green
The sky is never blue, itÂ´s freezing
Never get sunny days in the Boston Green
The sky is never blue, itÂ´s freezing
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.

[Repeat 2nd Verse]

Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.
Remember the Sun
Days just go on.

Days just go on...
Days just go on...

Days just go on.
