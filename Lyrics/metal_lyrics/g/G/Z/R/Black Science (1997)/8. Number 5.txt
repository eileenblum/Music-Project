The 5A is a spectre
It goes along Witton Road
And starts to pick up
Ghosts of old
From where the lonely people
Used to live

No.5 No.5 and 7
No.5 Took me to my Heaven.
No.5 No.5 and 7
No.5 Took me to my Heaven.

The toy shopÂ´s no longer there
And no-one else seems to care
The sacred heart starts to weep
Its children long gone to sleep
Remains of my yesterday
My plastic dreams blown away

No.5 No.5 and 7
No.5 Took me to my Heaven.
No.5 No.5 and 7
No.5 Took me to my Heaven.
No.5 No.5 and 7

Secret worlds within my attic
Ties that bind me to their magic
No.5 and No.7 took me all the way to Heaven
In my attic, Witton magic
Witton magic, weÂ´re all magic
Days of magic, Aston magic.

The toys shopÂ´s no longer there, why did it have to go away
Why did it have to go away, my plastic dreams blown away
The sacred heart starts to weep, for memories I need to keep
Forever locked here inside are secrets I learned to hide
The toy shopÂ´s no longer there, and no-one else seems to care
Why did it have to go away, my plastic dreams blown away.
My plastic dreams blown away...
My plastic dreams blown away...
My plastic dreams blown away...

No.5 No.5 and 7
