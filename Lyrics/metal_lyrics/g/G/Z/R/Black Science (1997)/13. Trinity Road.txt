Killing Burning Stabbing Hurting Hating Every Second Of the day
Sanitizing Analyzing Criticizing all I have to say
I canÂ´t take another second of this Human Race, Inhuman Race

Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.

Sex Death Satan Jesus save us Help me every second now I pray
IÂ´m positively negative. Unsure if this is how I want to stay
IÂ´m frightened of the bollocks on T.V. In the Press and Radio

Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.

Hypnotize me Patronize me Sympathize with Everything I say
Satirize me Crucify me Brutalize me Every single way
Simplify me Death defy me But thereÂ´s just One thing I have to say

Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
Please let me go down Trinity Road.
