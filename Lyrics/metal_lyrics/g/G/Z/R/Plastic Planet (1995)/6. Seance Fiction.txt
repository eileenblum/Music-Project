Brain [repeat]

Hello?

Eat me

Face at my window
Eyes in the shadow
Staring right through me
Someone who knew me

Silent possession
Spectral procession
I feel the violence
In freezing silence

Ethereal laughter
From the hereafter
Consumes with fear
Why are you here

Pervading presence
Invades my conscience
Screams break the silence
I feel your violence

We are the sins of man
Trapped here since time began
We are the spawn of shame
From where all hatred came

We are the sins of man
Are the sins of man

We are the sins of man
Trapped here since time began
We are the spawn of shame
From where all hatred came

Ethereal laughter
From the hereafter
Consumes with fear
Why are you here?

Pervading presence
Invades my conscience
Screams break the silence
I feel your violence
