Download me, kill me
I know, what I do
Time dreams are everywhere
They're watching you, too
When life slips away
Fear tastes the kill
Death teacher find me
They know what to do

Morpheus calls me
My future is here
Sleep not to dream
The meaning unclear
Down morphine passages
Through cybersex sleaze
To terrormorph images
Of viral disease

No time in space
No planet of hate
All ethics fade
In this silicon state

I stand at death's door
There's no need to knock
Hands of tomorrow
Winding death's clock

Morpheus calls me
My future is here
Sleep not to dream
The meaning unclear
Down morphine passages
Through cybersex sleaze
To terrormorph images
Of viral disease

No time in space
No planet of hate
All ethics fade
In this silicon state

No time in space
No planet of hate
All ethics fade
In this silicon state

Download me, digitize me
Download me, digitize me

Morpheus calls me
My future is here
Sleep not to dream
The meaning unclear

No time in space
No planet of hate
All ethics fade
In this silicon state

No time in space
No planet of hate
All ethics fade
In this silicon state
