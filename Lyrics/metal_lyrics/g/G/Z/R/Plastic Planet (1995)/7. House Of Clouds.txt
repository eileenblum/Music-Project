Looking back inside my hell
At all the things I knew so well
And in my mind I feel the tears
The times I had through all those years

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Innocence that grew to pain
All those days that turned to rain
I'm looking back inside my hell

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Someone save me
Someone save me
Someone save me
Someone save me

Inside myself resides the ghost
Of dreams I save that matter most
Inside my mind, a house of clouds

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Someone save me
Someone save me

Inside empty hush
My fear and love lie crushed
I feel those hurting ways
From my yesterdays

Looking back inside my hell
All the things I knew so well
Inside myself resides the ghost

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help

Somebody, save me from
From myself, I need help
