You bastardised my intellect
Castrated our conviction
You are desperately seeking Satan
Now that you've burned
Your bridges down

You plagiarised and parodied
The magic of our meaning
You can't admit that you're wrong
The spirit is dead and gone

You don't bother me
You are history
A legend in our own mind
Left all your friends behind
No one seems to care
And Satan is not there
There's nothing left to boast
Time to give up the ghost

You are desperately seeking Satan

Black magic has turned to dust
It's time to put the thing to rest
You can't admit that you're wrong
The spirit is dead and gone

You don't bother me
You are history
A legend in our own mind
Left all your friends behind

No one seems to care
And Satan is not there
There's nothing left to boast
Time to give up the ghost

You cannot admit that you're wrong
The spirit is dead and gone
You cannot admit that you're wrong
The spirit is dead and gone

You plagiarized and parodied
The magic of our meaning
You can't admit that you're wrong
The spirit is dead and gone

You don't bother me
You are history
A legend in your own mind
Left all your friends behind

No one seems to care
And Satan is not there
There's nothing left to boast
Time to give up the ghost

Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost

Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost

Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghost

Time to give up the ghost
Time to give up the ghostâ¦
