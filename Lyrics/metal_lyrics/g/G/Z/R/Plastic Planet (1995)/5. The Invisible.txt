Invisible, the man on the street
The voice of silence,
You don't want to meet
The homeless, the poor
Society's dregs
The drunk and the junkie
The woman who begs

Old and dying are obsolete
Children crying in the street
Drugs abusing, our memory losing
Invisible are everywhere

Invisible, victims of crime
Police and villains
Wasters of time
Scapegoats and prodigals
Social outcasts
Lost boys and girls, iconoclasts

Old and dying are obsolete
Children crying in the street
Drugs abusing, our memory losing
Invisible are everywhere

Invisible, the child you abuse
The people who die for the drugs that you use
The wife that you batter, the husband you cheat
The old and the dying, the now obsolete
The now obsolete, obsolete
The now obsolete, obsolete

Obsolete
Invisible
Invisible
Invisible

Invisible, the child you abuse
The people who die for the drugs that you use
The wife that you batter, the husband you cheat
The old and the dying, the now obsolete

Old and dying are obsolete
Children crying in the street
Drugs abusing, our memory losing
Invisible are everywhere
