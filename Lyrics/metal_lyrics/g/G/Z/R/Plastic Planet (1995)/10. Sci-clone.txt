You will be assimilated

Through sci-clone eyes you will see
No compromise you will be free
To realise your destiny
No sacrifice come follow me

You're not machine
You're not human
You have no thoughts of your own
Just a small part of a network
Take a number
Follow me

The future hides your history
In sterilised security
Lobotomised, dehumanised
Through sci-clone eyes you will see

You're not machine
You're not human
You have no thoughts of your own
Just a small part of a network
Take a number
Follow me

Assimilate, assimilate

You're not machine
You're not human
You have no thoughts of your own

Through sci-clone eyes you will see
No compromise you will be free
To realise your destiny
No sacrifice, come follow me

Lobotomised, dehumanised
Through sci-clone eyes you will see

You're not machine
You're not human
You have no thoughts of your own
Just a small part of a network
Take a number
Follow me

You're not machine
You're not human
You have no thoughts of your own
Just a small part of a network
Take a number
Follow me
