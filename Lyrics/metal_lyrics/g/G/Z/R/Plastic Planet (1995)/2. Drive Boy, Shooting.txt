Mother man, protect your son
They're killing children just for fun
Politicians, they eat the poor
Regurgitate, then eat some more

Back on black
White on white
There's only wrong
There is no right
One for one
And none for all
Piece not peace
And fuck you all

Deconstruction of the truth
Annihilation of our youth
Rotting in our self-pollution
It's just another drive boy, shooting

Back on black
White on white
There's only wrong
There is no right
One for one
And none for all
Piece not peace
And fuck you all

The politics of sin and greed
Are all you need to suck seed
Mother, man, father, clown
Drive boy's gonna shoot you down

Mother man, protect your son
They're killing children just for fun

Back on black
White on white
There's only wrong
There is no right

One for one
And none for all
Piece not peace
And fuck you all

Our is not to reason why
Theirs is just to steal and lie

Our is not to reason why
Theirs is just to steal and lie

Mother man, protect your son
They're killing children just for fun

Back on black
White on white
There's only wrong
There is no right

There's one for one
And none for all
Piece not peace
And fuck you all

Our is not to reason why
Our is not to reason why
Our is not to reason why
Theirs is just to steal and lie
Our is not to reason why
Theirs is just to steal and lie
