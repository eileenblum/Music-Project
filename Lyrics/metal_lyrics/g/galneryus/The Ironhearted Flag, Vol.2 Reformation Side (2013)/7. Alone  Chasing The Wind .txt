You're my only one
I pray for you not to be alone
You're my only one
Enough I'm the only lonely one
You're my only one
I pray for you not to be alone
It's in anyone
The love is so sad!

Alone what is loneliness?
Don't know whether you like loneliness
Ima to iu toki o tada ikite
Alone wherever you will be
I love you think of you all the time

Mada mienai ashita o matteru
Kono basho de okotta koto subete
Omoide shite? Soko ni wa nani mo nai yo
Kizutsuke ai eta mono wa subete
Kioku no naka de tomadotte nokoru
Nagashita namida mo te ni shita nukumori mo
Omoide ni shimatte yo Because it's so sad!

Mada mienai ashita o matteru
Kimi wa naiteita ne boku wa soba de
Yorisou koto shika kimi ni dekinai mama de
Mitsuketa mono wa kokoro nanka janai
Nukegara no tsunagari dake o motome tsudzuke
Nagashita namida mo te ni shita nukumori mo
Omoide ni shimatte yo oh let me forget!
