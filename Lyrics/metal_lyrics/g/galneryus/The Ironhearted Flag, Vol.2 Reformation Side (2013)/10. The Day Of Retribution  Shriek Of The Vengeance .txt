Now the mighty force sways my soul
It seems to go through hell and I lose control

I have to fight myself
It must be the fight to break with my flaw
To have my volition!ãDon't take a rash motion!

How long will my storm last?ãI wander in the dark
It seems to be a drawnback and I feel a sense of loss

I need to get results
I wanna end those sleepless nights
To have my volition!ãDon't take a rash motion!
Hurry and hurryãNow escape that danger

When I win this terrible fight
Surely I will get new light
That makes my life splendid
I think so
Nothing daunted!ãNo more!
When I'm given a jenuine chance
Surely I'll make a big advance

That makes my life shine
I just think so
Nothing daunted!ãNo more!

Obtain the worldãTaking a steady aim
The day of retribution

I have to fight myself
It must be the fight to break with my flaw
To have my volition!ãDon't take a rash motion!
Hurry and hurryãNow I'm breaking the chain

When I win this terrible fight
Surely I will get new light
That makes my life splendid
I think so
Nothing daunted!ãNo more!
When I'm given a jenuine chance
Surely I'll make a big advance
That makes my life shine
I just think so
Nothing daunted!ãNo more!
