[Lyricistï¼SHO, Composerï¼Syu]

A freezing cold winter night
I found the star like your eye
Why would I wanna cry?
Cause it remembers your "good-bye"

I don't know what was bad for you
My heart was too weak at that time
I don't know what was lack for you
Feel sad and lonely sometimes
The seasons rotate but I'm standing still
It's fine with me Think it's good?
Descending my life will never end
I wander in the maze

Wings of misery
Show me the way to stay beside before my soul is gone away
Get me back your heart
I'm falling apart Realize that I am not strong
Must I resign myself to my fate? Do I give it up?
No way!
To repent of my sins Am I a loser?
I'm in a flat spin I can't stand it
It's like the world of jet-black dark evermore

A humid night of ardor
Still looking for your shadow
Do I continue it forever?
Just say to myself "Game is over"

I don't know what tormented you
My thought was shallow at that time
I don't know what has upset you
Wanna hold you one more time

Even if time passes, (I'm) wandering
It's fine with me Think it's good?
Descending my life will never end
I wander in the maze

Wings of misery
Show me the way to stay beside before my soul is gone away
Get me back your heart
I'm falling apart Realize that I am not strong
Must I resign myself to my fate? Do I give it up?
No way!
To repent of my sins Am I a loser?
I'm in a flat spin I can't stand it
It's like the world of jet-black dark evermore

The seasons rotate but I'm standing still
It's fine with me Think it's good?
Descending my life will never end
I wander in the maze

Wings of misery
Show me the way to stay beside before my soul is gone away
Get me back your heart
I'm falling apart Realize that I am not strong
Must I resign myself to my fate? Do I give it up?
No way!
To repent of my sins Am I a loser?
I'm in a flat spin I can't stand it anymore!

Wings of misery
Show me the way to stay beside before my soul is gone away
Get me back your heart
I'm falling apart Realize that I am not strong
Must I resign myself to my fate? Do I give it up?
No way!
To repent of my sins Am I a loser?
I'm in a flat spin I can't stand it

I wanna be freed from these pains now
How do I get you back in my arms? Like that day
I have spent the days like the nightmare It's suffering
Flying in the world of jet-black, Wings of misery
