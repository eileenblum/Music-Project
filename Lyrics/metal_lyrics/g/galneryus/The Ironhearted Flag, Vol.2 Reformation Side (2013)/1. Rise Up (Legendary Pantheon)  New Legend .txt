Do not forget the past in order to fight
I will get many chancesãTo arm!
And I can change my fate with a keen insight
Because I have a good luck charm

Can you see?
Burning like a fireãIt's my heart
The anger turns into my power
Keep looking for another world

I always think âWhat is necessary?â
Only wanna be the winnerãNo harm!
There is a desire without mean blight
It's all rightãI'm always fine

Can you see?
Burning like a fireãIt's my soul
The sorrow turns into my power
Keep looking for another world

Rise up!
Now you follow me to fight
My ambition swallows your life
And I promise to surprise you

The world is indiscreet
Can you follow me tonight
My ambition swallows your life
And I promise to attract you
Behold none can defeat no more

Do not forget the past in order to fight
I will get many chancesãTo arm!
And I can change my fate with a keen insight
Because I have a good luck charm

Can you see?
Burning like a fireãIt's my heart
The anger turns into my power
Keep looking for another world

Rise up!
Now you follow me to fight
My ambition swallows your life
And I promise to surprise you
The world is indiscreet
Can you follow me tonight
My ambition swallows your life
And I promise to attract you
Behold none can defeat no more
