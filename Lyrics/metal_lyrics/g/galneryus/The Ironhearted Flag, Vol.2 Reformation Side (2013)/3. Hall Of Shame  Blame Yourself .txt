Dame, I am claiming no blameãFinding me in your hand
Know it, but still keep playing your game
I am taking all defameãWasting on you a grand
Blow it! Glut till a swain turn to a man

Heat, getting higher inside of meãFeel it grow in me
You're giving dire catastrophy instead of smiling back
Not letting squires intrude freeãZeal is not worth a key?
Now, begging why don't you smile for me?
Oh, I see a gaping abyssãSo, my wishing it is a miss!?
All I want is a bit of bliss even if there is no love

You light my fireãBurning brighter
Relief giving is all I want
Twisted desireãSo, you name it a fictitious romance
You light my fireãAwaiting mire?
Belief giving is all I hope
Twisted desireãNo, I don't shame a fictitious romance

Pain, there is nothing to gainãRunning into the sands
No matter what you say, it'll be the same
There is only a thing in vainãWarning, not to stand
Though, rather shut it out for no return

So relieved, you've been beside me while I'm in blue
I believed, you are the one for me
Shame myself, regret my pastãFlame my heart so eager to last

Oh, my greed is ready to blastãBelieving there is your love

You light my fireãBurning brighter
Relief giving is all I want
Twisted desireãSo, you name it a fictitious romance
You light my fireãAwaiting mire?
Belief giving is all I hope
Twisted desireãNo, I don't shame a fictitious romance

Agonies, feel lonely for so long
I'm so weakãI'm grieving I've been lost in my life
And so bleakãUrging on me must be strong
Oh, so pleaseãSet me free

Heat, getting higher inside of meãFeel it grow in me
You're giving nothing but flatteries
Once I thought were sweet memories
Not losing what is the primaryãZeal is sure worth a key
Now heading, want to be strong again
No, I would let no one to floutãSo, I'll quit whining about
Oh, I swear to keep striding out cause I know I must carry on

You light my fireãBurning brighter
Relief giving is all I want
Twisted desireãSo, I name it a fictitious romance
You light my fireãAwaited mire
Belief giving is all I hope
Twisted desireãNo, I don't shame a fictitious romance
