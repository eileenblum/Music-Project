One dayãI had a curious dream
It was a prophetic dream
SomedayãMy wish will come true
I'll take possession of all

Greed for controlãGreed for power
There's no limit to greed
Take away your heartãTake away your soul
Take all of youã(To) make you surrender
A prisoner of love

You'll surely kneel at my feet and you'll entreat
You must not be afraid that you are hurt
Feel everythingãSacrifice all
It's not a bad thing
Feeling of heavenãFeeling of pleasure
A prisoner of love

To devote my life
You'll devote yourself to me forever
Don't break a vow

Feeling the holy timeãThere's you in my arm
Naked souls spend very holy time
And that'll never endã(I) wanna keep believing it
For my lifeãFor your life
We will reach at the time of fate
Till the end of time, I swear to you

Greed for controlãGreed for power
There's no limit to greed
Take all of youã(To) make you surrender
A prisoner of love

Fell everythingãSacrifice all
It's not a bad thing
Feeling of heavenãFeeling of pleasure
A prisoner of love

I feel strong mightãWanna have all of you
(I) Won't make you regretãI'll take you anywhere
To devote my life
You'll devote yourself to me forever
Don't break a vow

Feeling the holy timeãThere's you in my arm
Naked souls spend very holy time
And that'll never endã(I) wanna keep believing it
For my lifeãFor your life
We will reach at the time of fate
No, I don't change even if the darkness comes

Feeling the holy timeãThere's you in my arm
Naked souls spend very peaceful time
And that'll never endã(I) wanna keep believing it
For my lifeãFor your life
We will reach at the time of fate and truth
No, I don't change even if the time passes
No, I won't change even if the darkness comes
