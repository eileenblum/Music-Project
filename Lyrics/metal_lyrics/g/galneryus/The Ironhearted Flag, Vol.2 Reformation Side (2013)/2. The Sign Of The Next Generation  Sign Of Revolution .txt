Somebody leads meãI trace the way
The gate of the unknown world is waiting for meãFeel it
I go there to satisfy myself
The gate of the unknown world is waiting for meãKnow it

The land was lit up with the blazing sun
I don't have time to take a restãRun and run!

Somebody needs usãWe hear voices
The gate to the leader is waiting for usãWe feel it
We go there to satisfy ourselves
The gate to the leader is waiting for usãWe know it

The sky is covered by genuine darkness
We don't have time to take a restãRun and run!
We are fearless!

Let me get that thing
âThe sign of the next generationâ
Burn up the fakingãI do only a noble action
Let me hold that thing
âThe sign of the next generationâ
I'm still searching for that

Get the seal of force
âThe sign of the next generationâ
Build up my strong fortãI will reach my destination
Keep the seal of force
âThe sign of the next generationâ
Now I obtain my dream
Can I find it out?
I act without thinkingãAnd now never say die!
