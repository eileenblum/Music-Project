In The hard time we liveãWe feel a savage mood
But I must live in thatãEven if I feel sadness
Open my eyes wide and find out something new
Raise a shout!ãCut it out!ãI've got to have my freedom

Oh, I can not blame nobodyãI may stand alone
I wander searching for the light
I wander searching for the might
My time has comeãFeel my heart!

Craving for normalityãWishing to win morality
I have a strong willãNever fail
I go ahead with glowing soul
I don't forget that pastãBut (I) don't stay
Do my best and I live in every day
I have a strong willãNever fail
I go ahead with glowing soul

Please bend an ear nowãPlease do so by all means
There must be something wrongãDid you really try all means?
It is not good to force your ideas on others
Raise a shout!ãCut it out!ãI've got to have my freedom

Oh, I don't know whether I'm rightãI may stand alone
I wander searching for the light
I wander searching for the might
My time has comeãFeel my claim!

Craving for normalityãWishing to win morality
I have a strong willãNever fail
I go ahead with glowing soul
I don't forget that pastãBut (I) don't stay

Do my best and I live in every day
I have a strong willãNever fail
I go ahead with glowing soul

Look at night sky and mutter
Everyone is longing for tomorrow
I wanna find a solution in a hurry
Oh, everyone hopes for the end of this sorrow

Now they drift without feeling something
What do they wanna do?ãTell me that
Oh, I can not blame nobodyãI may stand alone
I wander searching for the light
I wander searching for the might
My time has comeãFeel my heart!

Craving for normalityãWishing to win morality
I have a strong willãNever fail
I go ahead with glowing soul
I don't forget that pastãBut (I) don't stay
Do my best and I live in every day
I have a strong willãNever fail
I go ahead with glowing soul

Look at night sky and mutter
Everyone is longing for tomorrow
I wanna find a solution in a hurry
Oh, everyone hopes for the better future
Look at night sky and mutter
Everyone hopes for no more âharrowâ
I wanna find a solution in a hurry
Oh, everyone hopes for the end of this sorrow
