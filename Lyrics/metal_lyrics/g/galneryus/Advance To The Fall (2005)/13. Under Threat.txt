[Bonus Track]I don't buy what you say
I build a fire of the steel
I'm feeling the weight of world
I carry it for a day

In the dark we all are waiting for the delight
Even if you entrapping me, I'll never give up
So I am alive

Oh, the sound played by creatures
Oh, that will disturb my mind
No, the dark will invades your mind
No, the world is in the end of time

In the dark we all are waiting for the delight
Even if you entrapping me, I'll never give up
So I am alive

Now, run for your life
You don't forget under threat
Breakdown is actualized slowly
You're ready to fight?
You don't forget under threat
Breakdown is actualized surely

Runnin' through the night
Goin' through the path
You are the only one

In the dark we all are waiting for the delight
Even if you entrapping me, I'll never give up
So I am alive

Now, run for your life
You don't forget under threat
Breakdown is actualized slowly
You're ready to fight?
You don't forget under threat
Breakdown is actualized surely

Runnin' through the night
Goin' through the path
You are the only one
