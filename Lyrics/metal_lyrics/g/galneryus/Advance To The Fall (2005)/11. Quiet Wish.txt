Facing my destiny
I walk alone
I know I'm at the point of no return
They put me down
Years of fighting is never end
See the blood on street
You don't fear

why don't you realize your life is gone?
Ignorance of the world is makes me cry
Standing alone
Silence that meaning the end
See the blood on street
You don't leave me

Wish the strength of the soul
So I need deliverance
Into the chaos and slipping away

There's a fighting for freedom
It's a quiet wish
Call of the steel, now it makes you go
There's a fighting for freedom
It's a quiet wish
Now I expose noble confidence in this world

It's took so long to find this small light
There is no day without a morning sun
No more a sigh
We just find the way to go
Feel the joy in your heart still alive

Wish the strength of the soul
So I need deliverance
Into the chaos and slipping away

There's a fighting for freedom
It's a quiet wish
Call of the steel, now it makes you go
There's a fighting for freedom
It's a quiet wish
Now I expose noble confidence in this world

Wish the strength of the soul
So I need deliverance
Into the chaos and slipping away

[Repeat X2]
There's a fighting for freedom
It's a quiet wish
Call of the steel, now it makes you go
There's a fighting for freedom
It's a quiet wish
Now I expose noble confidence in this world
