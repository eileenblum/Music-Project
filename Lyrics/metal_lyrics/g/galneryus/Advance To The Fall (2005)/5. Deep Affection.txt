Cry out
Now I just see your eyes so blight
No one can break the chains of trust
I'll be there for you
I fight until the end

Stride out
I can go any where with you
In the middle of the night, we'll fly
I feel the warm of your love in everything

Comin' to me
Don't blow up your dream
I just want to see your smile
Fighting for you
Begging for you
I don't never leave you

Even if the world is covered with darkness,
our fire of love can be light
Falling down to the deep
The affection to you
Oh my life is always there for you

Stride out
I can go anywhere with you
In the middle of the night, we'll fly
I feel the warm of your love in everything

Comin' to me
Don't blow up your dream
I just want to see your smile
Fighting for you
Begging for you
I don't never leave you

Even if the world is covered with darkness,
our fire of love can be light
Falling down to the deep
the affection to you
Oh, my life is always there for you

[Repeat X3]
Even if the world is covered with darkness,
our fire of love can be light
Falling down to the deep
The affection to you
Oh, my life is always there for you
