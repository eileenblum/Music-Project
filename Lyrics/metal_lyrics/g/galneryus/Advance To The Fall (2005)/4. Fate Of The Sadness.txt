Remember the ancient pain
No one know your name
Now you just walkin' on the road of madness

Just feel the fire of steel
If you want take a chance
We get a power
Now the battle begins

Watching the dance of death
Feeling the fear of dark
Now you just flowin' on the sea of madness

Just feel the fire of steel
if you want take a change
Rolling like thunder
War is still never end

I want to see the Promised Land
Fate of the sadness
I cry for you

My heart is burning high
Breaking the chains you feel
Now I just take a force that bring the glory

Just feel the fire of steel
If you want make a change
Oh, please don't cry no more
I believe in you

Watching the dance of death
Feeling the fear of dark
Now you just flowin' on the sea of madness

Just feel the fire of steel
If you want make a change
Rolling like thunder
War is still never end

I want to see the Promised Land
Fate of the sadness
I cry for you
I want to see the Promised Land
Fate of the sadness
I cry for you

Walking on the mountain's top
I will catch the cloud and through the sky
The scene is such a beautiful
I feel a warm

Walking on the mountain's top
I will catch the cloud and through the sky
You take my soul so far away I loose my mind

I want to see the Promised Land
Fate of the sadness
I cry for you
I want to see the Promised Land
Fate of the sadness
I cry for you

Walking on the mountain's top
I will catch the cloud and through the sky
The scene is such a beautiful
I feel a warm
Walking on the mountain's top
I will catch the cloud and through the sky
You take my soul so far away I loose my mind
