Now I'm falling down
The bright of the steel comin' so near to me
Now I just feel

Now I'm falling down
The bright of the steel comin' so near to me
Now I just feel

The scenery disappears
I just lay down my body
My heart is beating so fast
The time has come

Lookin' my eyes, you will see
The flame is burning so high
I just feel the death coming near
This is the end

Oh...
From behind, the god of death is near
Oh...
He catches my neck and takes me away

Struggle of human is never end
We are in the doom
No one can stop the time
The flame of the spirit is never die
I'm calling you
Why don't you hear?

Struggle of human is never end
We are in the doom
No one can stop the time
The flame of the spirit is never die
I'm calling you
Why don't you hear?

Don't forget the trust that bring us the hope
No one can run away from test of the time
The bright of the steel comin' so near to me

Oh...
From behind, the god of death is near
Oh...
He catches my neck and takes me away
Now my life is end
Please take my hand
Now I say good-bye
Don't you cry no more

Struggle of human is never end
We are in the doom
No one can stop the time
The flame of the spirit is never die
I'm calling you
Why don't you hear?
Struggle of human is never end
We are in the doom
no one can stop the time
The flame of the spirit is never die
I'm calling you
Why don't you hear?

Don't forget the trust that bring us the hope
No one can run away from test of the time
The bright of the steel comin' so near to me

[Repeat X3]
Now I'm falling down
The bright of the steel comin' so near to me
Now I just feel
