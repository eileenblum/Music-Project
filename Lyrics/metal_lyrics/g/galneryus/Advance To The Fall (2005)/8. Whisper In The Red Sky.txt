When the night meets the day, I will watchin' the red sky
Heart the whisper of wind
Take a power that never end

History tells a lie
We don't believe the Darkest Age
Change the time of the gloom
We just fight for the freedom

From the past I'm hearing
There is a voice that's calling me
Just feel the fire it's never end
On through the night, we are striding on and on

Hear voices in the heat
Spreading your wings and fly away
I just feel your power of the steel
So I'll never die
In the heat
Spreading your wings and fly away
I just feel your power of the steel
So I'll never die

No one can stop the force
The assault must go on and on
Change the world with the power of steel
We are alive

From the past I'm hearing
There is a voice that's calling me
Just feel the fire it's never end
On through the night, we are striding on and on

Hear voices in the heat
Spreading your wings and fly away
I just feel your power of the steel
So I'll never die
In the heat
Spreading your wings and fly away
I just feel your power of the steel
So I'll never die

From the past I'm hearing
There is a voice that's calling me
Just feel the fire it's never end
On through the night, we are striding on and on

[Repeat X2]
Hear voices in the heat
Spreading your wings and fly away
I just feel your power of the steel
So I'll never die
In the heat
Spreading your wings and fly away
I just feel your power of the steel
So I'll never die
