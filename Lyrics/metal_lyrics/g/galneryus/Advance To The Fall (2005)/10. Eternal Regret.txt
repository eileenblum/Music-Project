Feeling now
The star light fade away
Crying now
There is no way to feel
Sadness that makes me down
The moon light up the headstone
You just walk away

I'm alone
Your soul just goes away
I'm alone
The silence means the prayer
Sadness that makes me down
The moon light up the headstone
You just walk away

I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
Cry for eternal regret

I'm alone
Your soul just goes away
I'm alone
The silence means the prayer
Sadness that makes me down
The moon lights up the headstone
you just walk away

I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
Cry for eternal regret

I find the way for me
The regret prompts for the make my mind
Gripping tight my sword to fight
Can you feel?
Now I just stand to make a chance

I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
Sleep you now
I'm touching your cold face
I'll meet you at another day
I'll give you this flower now
Cry for eternal regret
