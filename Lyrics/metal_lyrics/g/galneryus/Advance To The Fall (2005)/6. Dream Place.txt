Give me back the place where I belong
I'm just standing alone where the place that far from home
Give me back the place where I belong
I can't stop this feeling, you know
All I need is the miracle

Into the heat, through the wind
Yes, my heart is so hot
I remember my dream
Oh please, you don't cry no more
I hold you tight

Give me back the place where I belong
I want you come to my world
Let's share a dream
So we are one

Into the heat, through the wind
Yes, my heart is so hot
I remember my dream
Oh please, you don't cry no more
I hold you tight

Back to the street, where the place feels so warm
Back to the street, every one invites me
In the night, we walk along on the street that takes me home
Back to the street, where the place feels so warm
Back to the street, every one invites me
I feel so new under the sun

Into the heat, through the wind
Yes, my heart is so hot
I remember my dream
Oh please, you don't cry no more
I hold you tight

[repeat X2]
Back to the street, where the place feels so warm
Back to the street, every one invites me
In the night, we walk along on the street that takes me home
Back to the street, where the place feels so warm
Back to the street, every one invites me
I feel so new under the sun
