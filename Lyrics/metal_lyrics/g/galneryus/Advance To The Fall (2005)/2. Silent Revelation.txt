There's something dangerous in the night
You'll beware
Follow the sign that comes in deep from your heart
Now I just feel the fire of steel
My soul is burning hard
Taking a chance to fight for freedom you want

Falling down to silent ground
Get away, now it's my time to make a change
Bright of steel that cuts my eyes
Make my day, now I just ready to go

Breaking the tyrant's rule
Shake the world like a dog of war
Taking a chance to fight for freedom you want

Falling down to silent ground
Get away, now it's my time to make a change
Bright of steel that cuts my eyes
Make my day, now I just ready to go

Spark is the last scene you'll see
My sword bring you the end of your life
Your blood is spreading on the floor
It's like Silent revelation

Falling down to silent ground
Get away, now it's my time to make a change
Bright of steel that cuts my eyes
Make my day, now I just ready to go

Spark is the last scene you'll see
My sword bring you the end of your life
Your blood is spreading on the floor
It's like Silent...

Spark is the last scene you'll see
My sword bring you the end of your life
Your blood is spreading on the floor
It's like Silent revelation!!!
