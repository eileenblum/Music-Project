Somebody out there, ready to fight
Out of the light, you'll find another world

You open the door and you will see the battlefield
Now run for your life
You know there is
No time to wait

Chaos is coming, you'll slip away
The axe will down and you'll bleed to death

Nobody knows what is right way
You will be left in the danger zone

You don't touch the door and you will see the cruel scenery
Don't give up your fight
You know there is
No time to wait

Chaos is coming, you'll slip away
The axe will down and you'll bleed to death

Night after night, you'll fear the sound of destruction
Silent night never come again
Now you gotta fight for your life again

Chaos is coming, you'll slip away
The axe will down and you'll bleed to death
Chaos is coming, you'll slip away
The axe will down and you'll bleed to death

Night after night, you'll fear the sound of destruction
Silent night never come again
Now you gotta fight for your life again
