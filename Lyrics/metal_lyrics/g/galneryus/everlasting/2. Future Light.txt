[Music : Syu &amp; Yama-B; Lyrics: Yama-B]

I will be there,
You remember now
We shared our warmness each other
Please tell me why
You have changed your mind
Loneliness makes me so cold

I raise my hand again
To touch your desire
Oh, it's so real
Please don't walk away

A picture will make
Remember the days
We shared a dream of our future
Please tell me why
You have changed your mind
You leave me so torn up inside

I raise my hand again
To touch your desire
Oh, it's so real
Please don't walk away
Play it so loud,
I can't take any more
I spread my song
Please don't walk away

Far from the wind, I must return again
I'll reach the place that's filled with your future light
Far from the wind, I must return again
I'll reach the place that's filled with your future light

Fly high and high
I'll fight till the end
You don't let it end
I'm always there for you

Far from the wind, I must return again
I'll reach the place that's filled with your future light
Far from the wind, I must return again
I'll reach the place that's filled with your future light
Far from the wind, I must return again
I'll reach the place that's filled with your future light
Far from the wind, I must return again
I'll reach the place that's filled with your future light

Fly high and high
I'll fight till the end
You don't let it end
I'm always there for you
