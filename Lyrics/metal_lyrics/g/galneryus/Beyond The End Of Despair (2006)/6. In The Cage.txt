The light is passing by
I raise my hands
The unknown voice is calling me now
In the softly light, I'm looking back

Please find me out
Give me your smile
The unknown voice is calling me now
In the softly light, I'm looking back

Oh, you're the only one
I want to feel you again
I keep the prayer to you
There is a lonely place inside of me

Incredible future is so near me
I want to take it for me
Now I know why you don't treat me
I don't want to be a fool
Memory of you is in the cage
I want to break it away
I can find the exit now
The day to rescue you is so near

Watch that little pigeon
Flying through the sky
I don't know the place of the nest
It may be too meaningful our life

Oh, we are in the gloom
But I don't want to give up
I keep the prayer to you
There is a lonely place inside of me

Incredible future is so near me
I want to take it for me
Now I know why you don't treat me
I don't want to be a fool
Memory of you is in the cage
I want to break it away
I can find the exit now
The day to rescue you is so near

Remember the promises
Your smile makes me so high

Incredible future is so near me
I want to take it for me
Now I know why you don't treat me
I don't want to be a fool

Incredible future is so near me
I want to take it for me
Now I know why you don't treat me
I don't want to be a fool
Memory of you is in the cage
I want to break it away
I can find the exit now
The day to rescue you is so near
