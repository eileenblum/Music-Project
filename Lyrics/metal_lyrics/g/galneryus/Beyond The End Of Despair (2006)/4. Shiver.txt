Walking in sleepless night
I'm calling you. I wander gloom
Flowing the noise of night
that shakes my mind
Please take my hand

I know that no one can
keep holding the light
The light will bring the hope to your life
But it isn't realized

Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
I just feel the pain of the world

Into the heat of night, I've lost my way
Cry for the moon
Illusion of your eyes that shakes my mind
Please back in me

I know that no one can
keep holding the light
The light will bring the hope to your life
But it isn't realized

Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
I just feel the pain of the world

I know that no one can
keep holding the light
The light will bring the hope to your life
But it isn't realized

Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
Why don't you hear?

Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
Calling on you, I stand alone
I wanna get close to your side
Out of the night, I'm looking for you
Even if there is no future
I just feel the pain of the World
