Now the time has come
See the sign
The sword is by my side
Take the flag again

My soul is burning hard
You know that I cannot take anymore
There is no way to hide
I'll bring salvation

Cry for the morning light
The freedom calls for you
We are the warriors bringing the war and pain

My soul is burning hard
You know that I cannot take anymore
There is no way to hide
I'll bring salvation
Glory and honour
We only take it all

We know that is risky way
Approaching the sea of rage
We can overcome the pain
It is just a matter of time
Flying through the holy sky
Approaching the sea of rage
We can see the land of freedom
It's just a matter of time

We rule the world
The war cry will shake the ground
Shriek of the vengeance

My soul is burning hard
You know that I cannot take anymore
There is no way to hide
I'll bring salvation
Glory and honour
It's just a matter of time

We know that is risky way
Approaching the sea of rage
We can overcome the pain
It is just a matter of time
Flying through the holy sky
Approaching the sea of rage
We can see the land of freedom
It's just a matter of time
