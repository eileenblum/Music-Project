The light disappears
Now I feel the end
Seeing the black crow is calling the night
The serious fact kills my heart every time

I'm a prisoner of my lonely heart
I feel down cause I found no way out

Even if you kill me, my pain never ends
Day after day, I'll run away from my sin
I'm in the gloom
No one knows this fate
I feel the wind take every hope

The sin that I bid doesn't disappear
I must accept immediate reality
Cause I have no time to pray anymore

I'll go insane
I've lost my way
I feel down cause I found no way out

Even if you kill me, my pain never ends
Day after day, I'll run away from my sin
I'm in the gloom
No one knows this fate
I feel the wind take every hope
Light goes away
I wait for the dawn
Day after day, I hear the voice of the dark
I am dancing the tragic waltz
I feel the wind take every hope

I'm a prisoner of my lonely heart
I feel down cause I found no way out

Even if you kill me, my pain never ends
Day after day, I'll run away from my sin
I'm in the gloom
No one knows this fate
I feel the wind take every hope
Light goes away
I wait for the dawn
Day after day, I hear the voice of the dark
I am dancing the tragic waltz
I feel the wind take every hope
