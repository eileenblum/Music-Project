I see a big moonlight in the distance
The violet sunset over the sea

Your word is so shriek, I make up my mind
I got a warning, beware of night

In seeking after the real meaning of life
I fought through thousands of wars
I've lost my way
The past is the past
And all my moaning and
Groaning will not bring it back

I do something to prove myself again
My heart is burning
It's like a flame
The night is coming
The moon is so bright
I can't get the scene out of my mind

In seeking after the real meaning of life
I fought through thousands of wars
I've lost my way
The past is the past
And all my moaning and
Groaning will not bring it back

Look up the sky
We just see
Sign of the hope
The sun came shining through the clouds
The light has captured all of our hearts
We're at the point of no return
Into the heat of the night
We'll see the fact
Pride goes before a fall
The light has captured all of our hearts
We can eradicate the truth of the world

In seeking after the real meaning of life
I fought through thousands of wars
I've lost my way
The past is the past
And all my moaning and
Groaning will not bring it back

Look up the sky
We just see
Sign of the hope
The sun came shining through the clouds
The light has captured all of our hearts
We're at the point of no return
Into the heat of the night
We'll see the fact
Pride goes before a fall
The light has captured all of our hearts
We can eradicate the truth of the world
