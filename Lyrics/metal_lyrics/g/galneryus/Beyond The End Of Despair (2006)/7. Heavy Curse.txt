Calling all the creature in my mind
You know that hate is full in my mind
The black cloud covers the sky above

I just feel the fire of my soul
I take my own heart to that hell
To hell...

Oh, the cursing is my comfort
The friendship had ended
Now carry out for today
Remembrance is in the dark
It took so long to find my way
Carry out
I don't hear your cry

I just break all of our building
I know I must take sad decision
You change the rage into the power
You're confused by the reality

I just feel the fire of my soul
I take my own heart to that hell
To hell...

Oh, the cursing is my comfort
The friendship had ended
Now carry out for today
Remembrance is in the dark
It took so long to find my way
Carry out
I don't hear your cry

I just feel the fire of my soul
I take my own heart to that hell
To hell...

Oh, the cursing is my comfort
The friendship had ended
Now carry out for today
Remembrance is in the dark
It took so long to find my way
Carry out
I don't hear your cry

The cursing is my comfort
The friendship had ended
Now carry out for today
Remembrance is in the dark
It took so long to find my way
Carry out
I don't hear your cry
