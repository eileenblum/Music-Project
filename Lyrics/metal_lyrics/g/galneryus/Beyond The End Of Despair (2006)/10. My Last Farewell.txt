For all the cloud
I'll show the prime of the world
You watch my last carry out
You don't miss it
You know there's not a chance at all
Memorize the scene of my last

Feel the fire in the middle of the night
The days of the battle has arrived at last
The light is ripping my eyes
You'll see the end of my life
The ache of your heart
It will break your heart

Coming to the new world
But I can't see your smile
No one notices the truth
It's my last farewell
You must take the new world
I just feel your pleasure
I'll never forget your warmth
It's my last farewell

Here is the light
The light brings liberty to you
But don't touch the truth of the world
Please, warm me up
Shut out the cold air
Now I just determine

Feel the fire in the middle of the night
The days of the battle has arrived at last
The light is ripping my eyes
You'll see the end of my life
The ache of your heart
It will break your heart

Coming to the new world
But I can't see your smile
No one notices the truth
It's my last farewell
You must take the new world
I just feel your pleasure
I'll never forget your warmth
It's my last farewell

Feel the fire in the middle of the night
The days of the battle has arrived at last
The light is ripping my eyes
You'll see the end of my life
The ache of your heart
It will break your heart

Coming to the new world
But I can't see your smile
No one notices the truth
It's my last farewell
You must take the new world
I just feel your pleasure
No one notices the truth
It's my last farewell

Coming to the new world...
I just feel your pleasure...
