Craving...
I walk in the darkness
We're all in despair
Falling...
I've just lost my way
Cruelty is the strength of the wicked

There is no way to end the pain of war
Searching for the mercy
Vanishing hope. The fire is going out
I'm just on the edge
See the fading light
The pain has gotten worse

I would rather die than suffer so much pain
Isn't there a way to eliminate all wars?

I don't put my faith in the evil say
I keep the better way
Craving is the way to break all walls
Fighting on and on

Shaking the ground
My ardour is spreading to all over the world
Open your eyes

Feeling the unknown force
It's so marvelous
Breaking the dark
It's the immeasurable force
Now the evil is wiped
I just feel the dawn is near
For my right, for my dreams
I don't stop the fight for freedom
Till the end of time, I'll have spilled blood

I don't put my faith in the evil say
I keep the better way
Craving is the way to break all walls
Fighting on and on
I don't put my faith in the evil say
I keep the better way
Craving is the way to break all walls
Fighting on and on

I see the fact. The rage cannot be stopped
I feel my heart beat
I can't take anymore

Shaking the ground
My ardour is spreading to all over the world
Open your eyes

Feeling the unknown force
It's so marvelous
Breaking the dark
Now the evil is wiped
I just feel the dawn is near
For my right, for my dreams
I don't stop the fight for freedom
See the light that's so bright
Now the time has come

Feeling the unknown force
It's so marvelous
Breaking the dark
It's too early to give up
Now the evil is wiped
I just feel the dawn is near
For my right, for my dreams
I don't stop the fight until the end of time
See the light that's so bright
Now the time has come
See the light that's so bright
Now the time has come
