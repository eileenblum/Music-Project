I'll burn you away
Crack the wall of hate
Let the fight begin
To know why we live in this providence

Since the day we met
I've kept fighting into the wind
I don't need a false
The flame is calling me
Beware of the night
I'll never step aside
We'll overcome
No one can stop the raid

I swear in this holy night
I'll never die until the end
Into the fight of hell and glory
Now the light is calling me
See the circle of the fire
We're here to burn up all the night

Rain falls in the darkness
A blast voice calls the power
Now the time to receive
the judgement for the might for the liberty
Into the heat
We are soldiers
Into the heat
We are warriors
We get the force of the steel
That will never give up
In the night, we just raid you again

Since the day we met
I've kept fighting into the wind
I don't need a false
The flame is calling me
Beware of the night
I'll never step aside
We'll overcome
No one can stop the raid

I swear in this holy night
I'll never die until the end
Into the fight of hell and glory
Now the light is calling me
See the circle of the fire
We're here to burn up all the night

Rain falls in the darkness
A blast voice calls the power
Now the time to receive
the judgement for the might for the liberty
Into the heat
We are soldiers
Into the heat
We are warriors
We get the force of the steel
That will never give up
In the night, we just raid you again

Rain falls in the darkness
A blast voice calls the power
Now the time to receive
the judgement for the might for the liberty
Into the heat
We are soldiers
Into the heat
We are warriors
We get the force of the steel
That will never give up
In the night, we just raid you again
