Flight of the braving heart
I'm a prayer of the steel
I don't fear the reality of the dark world

The heat is filling my heart
And I never stop again
Can't you hear cry of the world
Find out your way

Falling down to the burning hell
No one knows why struggle is never end
Now I hope you will never shrink again
I just feel the fire is still burning

When I met you, I was so blue
The fever just fills my body
We are under Braving Flag
You fly through the sky
It's glorious
I wish you the best of luck

The wish will don't ever end
Even if the world ends
The flag is always by your side
Go ahead

Falling down to the burning hell
No one knows why struggle is never end
Now I hope you will never shrink again
I just feel the fire is still burning

When I met you, I was so blue
The fever just fills my body
We are under Braving Flag
You fly through the sky
It's glorious
I wish you the best of luck

When I met you, I was so blue
The fever just fills my body
We are under Braving Flag
You fly through the sky
It's glorious
I wish you the best of luck

When I met you, I was so blue
The fever just fills my body
We are under Braving Flag
You fly through the sky
It's glorious
I wish you the best of luck
