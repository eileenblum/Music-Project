I'm on the stage Always a challenge
Find out the moment of winning the honor
Endless journeys It's not so easy
Catch the moment of winning the honor

Trust myself! Ascertain!
I know that I have a strong will
Believe myself! Ingrain!
Time passes I don't keep still

I hate the fake Shake and bake
Find out the moment of winning the honor

Trust myself! Encourage!
I know what I should do now
Believe myself! Downstage!
I must keep winning somehow

Can I spend a fruitful day? Can I do it?
Sometimes I feel the strain
I have a sleepless night
But I have many friends I am not ever alone
Anyone believes that the dream comes true someday

Can I follow the right way? Can I do it?
Sometimes I get scared
I pass an uneasy night
But I have many friends I am not ever alone
Anyone believes that the dream comes true someday

Trust myself! Ascertain!
I know that I have a strong will
Believe myself! Ingrain!
Time passes I don't keep still

Can I spend a fruitful day? Can I do it?
Sometimes I feel the strain
I have a sleepless night
But I have many friends I am not ever alone
Anyone believes that the dream comes true someday

Can I follow the right way? Can I do it?
Sometimes I get scared
I pass an uneasy night
But I have many friends I am not ever alone
I keep on standing on the stage toward the dream
I can do!
