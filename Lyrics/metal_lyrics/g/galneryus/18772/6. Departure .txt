Standing on the ground with proudful eyes
The bravery you feel, it glows inside
Now you see the dawn, it's departure time
You can fly out now!

You might feel lonely
But you are not the only
You will see the leading light
Guide to the reason of your life

Filled with the tender
Truly gentle and splendor
Living in this world is filled with wonder

You can smile again!
Basking in the sun
You can fly away!
It is the time for you now
To raise and blaze up bright and shine

Standing on the ground with proudful eyes
The bravery you feel, it glows inside
Now you see the dawn, it's departure time
You can fly out now! (you can smile!)

It's never been too late to start up
Anything you trust
Never surrender, stand up again!

You'll keep on fighting
Knowing there is no ending
You will find the meanings
Answers to all of the things

You just try again!
Passing through the dark
You just go away!
There is the future, waiting for you to reach out
It's bright and shine

Fly through this infinite blue skies
Go and across this grand blue seas
Goddess might blow a kiss to you
Don't you lose a chance! (you can try!)

The world, never been seen is right there
Waiting for you
No need to be afraid, fly away!

Standing on the ground with proudful eyes
The bravery you feel, it glows inside
Now you see the dawn, it's departure time
You can fly out now! (you can smile!)

The endless quest is out there for you
Why not take your chance?
A chance to break through your boredom days

Let tears roll down and cry if you want
Tears shed will change to your strength
See and feel, your wings are glowing now
To the skies, fly high! (you can smile!)

There is an end to your sorrow and pain
You can overcome
You will be stronger day by day

Standing on the ground with proudful eyes
The bravery you feel, it glows inside
Now you see the dawn, it's departure time
You can fly out now! (you can smile!)

It's never been too late to start up anything you trust
Wherever you go (you can try!)
Whatever you do (you can try!)
Never surrender, stand up again!
