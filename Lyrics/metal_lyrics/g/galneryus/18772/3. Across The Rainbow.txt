I was influenced you were a great person
I like your way of life very much
When i was in trouble, i depended on you
I heard your gentle voice very much
You're heaven now please watch i do
Can you hear my voice? and how do you feel?
I wanna meet you
I wanna ask you about my voice and songs
What do you feel?

Please give me your power now!
I realize the wish somehow!
I want you to keep watching my growth
I will make an effort by my troth!

Across the rainbow!
Sometimes i go against the flow
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow!
I wanna say to you "hello"
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow! i will grow

You gave me knowledge for whom knew nothing
I shone with happiness very much
Oh i can feel you, but i can't see you
I am sad, i lost you very much

Please let me know your secrets now
I learn all of you somehow
I want you to keep hearing my shout
I will make an effort, out of doubt

Across the rainbow!
Sometimes i can meet your shadow
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow!
I wanna say to you "hello"
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow! i will grow

Please give me your power now!
I realize the wish somehow!
I want you to keep watching my growth
I will make an effort by my troth!

Give me your power now!

Across the rainbow!
Sometimes i go against the flow
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow!
I wanna say to you "hello"
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow!
Sometimes i can meet your shadow
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow!
I wanna say to you "hello"
Aim at the only existence
Oh push forward and break the silence
Across the rainbow! i will grow
