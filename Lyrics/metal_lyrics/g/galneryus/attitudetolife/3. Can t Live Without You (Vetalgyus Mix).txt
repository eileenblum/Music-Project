I finally reach there and find out my life
But you're not there wanna be with you all the time
My feelings don't reach you just seem to stand still
Can you see me? I live near you find me out!

I feel very lonely it's hard
I'm looking for you now feel my heart
It may take time it's fine with me
Wanna hug you

Live without you
That is what I can't think of
Can't live without you
I say aloud you hear me?
Even if time passes
My thought does not fade and does not change
I pray my wish will come true

You spend it like always and find out your life
But I'm not there you seem to like one
I don't know what you think of me

You're so fascinating it's true
I like that about you now feel my heart
It may take time it's fine with me
Wanna hug you

Live without you
That is what I can't think of
Can't live without you
I say aloud you hear me?
Even if time passes
My thought does not fade and does not change
I pray my wish will come true

I feel very lonely it's hard
I'm looking for you now feel my heart
It may take time it's fine with me
Wanna hug you

Live without you
That is what I can't think of
Can't live without you
I say aloud you hear me?
Live without you
That is what I can't think of
Can't live without you
I say aloud you hear me?
Even if the sun loses brightness and falls
My thought does not fade
Never change!
I pray for it my wish will come true
I believe it but is it a sad cry for you?
