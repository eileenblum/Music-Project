Fell upon trying times it was the sad times
But the sun shines on without burning out
Made a great sacrifice it wasn't once or twice
But the star shines on without falling down

What am I looking for? Where am I steering for?
I want power! It's an answer!

Believe my belief do it until I die
There is nothing disturbing my belief
Build up my faith do it lasts forever
There is nothing disturbing my faith

So many things were lost I often got lost
But the sun shines on without burning out
I had a sad farewell I have been in the hell
But the moon shines on without falling down

What am I searching for? Where am I steering for?
I got power! Found an answer!

Keep my belief do it until I die
Hate an act which goes against my belief
Act of my faith do it lasts forever
Hate an act which goes against my faith

Believe my belief do it until I die
There is nothing disturbing my belief
Buld up my faith do it lasts forever
There is nothing disturbing my faith

Keep my belief do it until I die
Hate an act which goes against my belief
Act of my faith do it lasts forever
Hate an act which goes against my faith
