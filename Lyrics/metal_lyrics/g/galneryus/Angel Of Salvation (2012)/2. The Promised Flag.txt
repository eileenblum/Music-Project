Yes, I could find the meaning of established flag
And then I'm able to move outside with my intuition from you
I only believe myself but don't wanna say more
Good-bye to my past and to my darkness

Look around and feel the freedom
Fight against the darkness on me
Overturn my obedience and my life
along with my iron heart
There's no fear, no hesitation

Reach to the sky
Let the flag raise again Don't look back
Go my way
Surely I can find the key
Reach to the sky
Let the flag raise again Don't lie to my heart
On my way
I can change my life once again

My body has been threatened by something wrong again
I have little bit of fear certainly but I don't care anything
There is my faith stronger than my weakness
and I do have mind that wanna go to the future
And my soul is still burning

Enduring the sleepless night
and thinking everything in few hours
And I accept your suffering and sorrow
into my iron heart
There's no fear, no hesitation

Reach to the sky
Let the flag raise again Don't look back
Go my way
Surely I can find the key
Reach to the sky
Let the flag raise again Don't lie to my heart
On my way
I can change my life once again

Wanna be stronger than yesterday
Wanna be brighter than before

Tomorrow is waiting for me surely
Now I'm breaking my cage
Fly to the other side

Look around and feel the freedom
Fight against the darkness on me
Overturn my obedience and my life
along with my iron heart
There's no fear, no hesitation
