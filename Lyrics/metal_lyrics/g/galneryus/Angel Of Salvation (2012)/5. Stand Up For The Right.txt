Why are you so selfish?
Your manner does not change
Why are you so foolish?
Your very strange thought does not change

Do you think you're really right?
You're a liar I think so
You are looking at the other side
There is no answer No!

Go away from this place
Do not touch my thing
You don't know your business
I feel disgusted
You never reveal your intension
Can't put up with your manner
That's the limit! No more!

I stand up for my right
Stand up in order to fight
Silence's been broken my anger
Demand an apology to you
Time has come
Fight in the cause of justice
Don't wander in the darkness
No matter what happened, I push ahead confidently
Everything goes just as I want now Go!

What is your shady scheme?
It must be so dangerous
Can't you hear other's scream?
Why are you calm? Your greed is endless

You do not feel anything
Your mind is a dull one
Your existence is annoying
It's not my idea of fun

Shut your mouth
Do not say anything more to me
You don't know your business
I can not agree
You never reveal your ambition
Can't put up with your thinking
That's the limit! No more!

I stand up for my right
Stand up in order to fight
Silence's been broken my anger
Demand an apology to you
Time has come
Fight in the cause of justice
Don't wander in the darkness
No matter what happened, I push ahead confidently
Everything goes just as I want now Go!

We stand up for our right
Stand up in order to fight
Silence's been broken our anger
Demand an apology to you
Time has come
Fight in the cause of justice
Don't wander in the darkness
No matter what happened, we push ahead confidently
Everything goes just as we want now Go!!

I can overthrow A fair wind blows
I'll make the first move
Come with me and everything goes just as I want
Shout for my pride My faith never dies
I'll make the first move
Come with me Stand up in order to fight
