I will take good aim at the target It is you
Give myself up to pleasure I don't rue
I wander about in search of new game at tonight It's you
Give yourself up to pleasure You don't rue

Buy time! I can drive a hard bargain
Let's talk about suffering and love Don't say "Bye"
Come out! What beautiful eyes you have! It's a sin
Don't look down I don't tell a lie

Were you deceived many times?
Can't believe the world
Wander lonely as a stranger
Yes! It's time!
Can you hear my true words?
Let's hope for the best now
Time will surely solve a problem
Don't follow the herd
I surely heal your heart and I receive all of you

I found you by chance and I fastened my eyes on you tonight
I can feel something special Hold me tight

How's tricks? Why do you look so sad?
Let's talk about suffering and love Don't say "No"
Come quick! What a beautiful voice you have! It's a sin
Don't look down I do not go slow

Were you betrayed many times?
You can't believe anything
Wander lonely as a stranger
Yes! It's time!
Can you feel my true mind?
Let's hope for the best now
I will surely solve a problem
It's all in the mind
I surely heal your heart and I received all of you
