The clouds have broken
Shining stars in the sky
I keep seeing them
And think about my existence

I sure know where I'm going
And I know what I should do too
Life is short It's in an instant
I will live my best Do it

Setting sun sinks
A hazy moon in the sky
I keep seeing them
And I can refresh my memories

The season passes early for me
I must begin to move soon
Life is deep It is difficult
I will live my best I swear it now

Fly into the night So, I go
I'll not flinch and I'll confront
Because I must find the true self
Look up into the sky So, I do
All of me become peaceful
Because I wanna feel infinity

It has stopped raining
There's a rainbow in the sky
I keep seeing them
And think about my existence

I know the vanity of living
And I know how I should behave
Life is hard It is not flat
I will live my best I swear it now

Fly into the night So, I go
I'll not stop and I will fight
Because I must get the true life
Look up into the sky So, I do
All of me become peaceful
Because I feel infinity

The season passes early for me
I must begin to move soon
Life is deep It is difficult
I will live my best I swear it now

Fly into the night So, I go
I'll not flinch and I'll confront
Because I must find the true self
Look up into the sky So, I do
All of me become peaceful
Because I feel infinity

The life is only once
Even if a grief beckons me
I'll not stop and I will fight
Because I must get the true life
I always look up into the sky
I become so peaceful
Because I wanna feel infinity
