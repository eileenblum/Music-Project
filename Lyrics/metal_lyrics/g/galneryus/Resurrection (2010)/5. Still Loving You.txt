Wonder why you left on that night
Wonder what you thought at that time
What can I do? Have I lost you?
What should I do? Have I lost you?

The season passes early for me
Something is lost from my body
Crazy about you, love you from my heart
Still loving you, love you from my heart

I regret my very happy days
Memories are fading away
I feel the night and days

[Refrain:]
Somebody said, "You must forget..."
But I cannot do yet
It's cold in my bed

[Chorus:]
Oh, there is no woman meant more than you
I wanna meet wanna touch
Do you hear this prayer of me?
I thought that love with you was forever
I miss you, we'll surely meet in the future
I don't know where and with whom you live now
It is not in my mind
Now all of you are not mine
I thought that love with you was forever
I miss you, we'll surely meet in the future

And I wish this pain would go
There is your shadow

[Refrain]

[Chorus]
