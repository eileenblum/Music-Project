Destiny is calling you, passing through your edge of heart
We're not a loss anymore, and look up your future...
OH, YEAH!

Mou mayou koto nado nai
Nayami tsudzukeru koto mo nai

Miageta sono toki, subete ni kidzuita
Ima made no ayamachi wo

Jibun wo miushinaisou ni naru koto nante, mou nai hazu
Jada hitotsu no onaji hoshi wo miteru

[Chorus:]
Destiny is calling you, passing through your edge of heart
We're not a loss anymore, and look up your future
And surely, we'll unite once again
We're filled with power
Don't lose the past
Gone with the steel

Mou nigeru koto nado nai
Kakae tsudzukeru mono mo nai

Miageta sono toki, subete ni kidzuita
Ima made no ayamachi wo

Jibun wo miushinaisou ni naru koto nante, mou nai hazu
Tada hitotsu no onaji hoshi wo miteru

[Chorus]

Ima ni mou kaesou datta hikari yo, mou ichido michibike
Tada hitotsu no onaji hoshi wo miteru

[Chorus]

Destiny is calling you, but you don't believe it
Keeper of the resurrection is standing alone
And surely, we'll unite once again with strong faith
Live to survive, live for my life
Just like...those stars!
