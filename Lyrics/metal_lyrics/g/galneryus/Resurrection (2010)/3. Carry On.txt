The fight is startedâgo ahead!
It's hard to fight with myself
I'll keep on doing till my deathbed
The darkness is on the way
Will I lose my way? Don't worry...
Take it easy and learn from the history

Do you always feel intense cry of my soul?
Feel and get it
To win, cry out everyday

[Chorus:]
I show the anger and the dirtiness
I think that it's an important thing to keep on fighting
I show the power and the weakness
It's necessary, do not take a restâcarry on!

Can I reach there before long?
It's all right, because I'm strong
I will be defended by my law
Do you understand why I fight?
Do you understand what I find?
I wanna bask in the tender light

I will confront the other side in my soul
Feel and break it
To win, cry out everyday

[Coda:]
I show the pleasure and the sadness
I think that it's an important thing to keep on fighting
I show the power and the craftiness
It's necessary, do not take a restâcarry on!

[Chorus]
