I will tell you the story of the surprise on that day
I will tell why I am doing so
I did not expect a thing
And it's a wonderful thing for my way of life
He said, "Do you wanna touch the star?
Do you wanna shine more than ever?"
I said, "I wanna do so by all meanings."
I thought such a chance was rare
I got excited very much

[Pre-Chorus:]
At that time...
I didn't hesitate to make up my mind
Now I feel the change slowly but surely
Oh! Can I catch the star like everyone else?
I know I should 'cause I wanna get it
Ready? Fly high!

[Chorus:]
Burn my heart into eternity
Satisfy everyoneâthat's the mission to myself
Burn my fearâoh, I'll never return to the past
Get your soul, take your soul
Let's blaze up at this time

What will I be able to do? I am still looking for that
It's like a treasure hunt it's not easy
It is waiting in the other side
Anyway, I should hurry up

I remember...
Getting over many difficulties in the past
But this time is more serious for me
Oh! Can I catch the star like everyone else?
I know I should 'cause I wanna get it
Ready? Fly high!

[Coda:]
Burn my heart into eternity
Satisfy myselfâthat's the mission to myself
Burn my fearâoh, I'll never return to the past
Get you soul, take your soul
Let's blaze up at this time

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Coda]

AH!

You and I will always believe the fate
Let's heat up together and follow me
I will satisfy you, I promise it to you
Get your soul, take your soul
Let's show our soul...
Blaze up now!
