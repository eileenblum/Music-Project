Sameta manazashi
Nani wo mitsudzukeru no ka
Mamoru beki mono?
Kodoku sae tamerashikuwa nai
Kono mi sae oshiku wa nai
Even if I rot away
Just keep on running

[Chorus:]
So far away, but I never give it up
Ima tokenai kizunaga
Unmei to kousaku shite yuku
I'll get over it, it's now
A far-off distance

Amai sasayaki
Doko he sasoi yuku no ka
Mayoi ochite mo
Shinjitsu no kakera wa aru
Even if I rot away
Just keep on praying

So far away, but I'll feel many loves
Kuzuresou na asu demo
Unmei no kodou wa myakuutsu
I'll get over it, it's now
A far-off distance

[Chorus]

[Coda:]
So far away, but I'll feel many loves
kuzuresou na asu demo
unmei no kodou wa myakuutsu
kagirinai mirai he tsudzuite yuku
Yeaaa... And I will get over it, it's now
A far-off distance

I believe in my destiny
Everyone knows! I'm not ever alone
Tomorrow never dies I can fly anytime
I have the truth from the past
Always in my heart
I devote my body
'Cause I have a bond, somebody will respond
Tomorrow never dies, I can fly anytime
Go to the end of life
There's no fear, it is bright
I'm alive!
