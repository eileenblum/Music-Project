You said, "Believe me please."
No way, don't get close to me, go away
You have no idea, always
ã
Kage dake ugomeku
Tada hitori odoru
Asu ga sukete mieru

[Refrain:]
Omae no sono yume ja
Kono saki nani mo umarenai
Onore no genkai wo shiru dake

I don't wanna look at your face
You should go some other place
The time spent with you is disgrace

Kakehiki ga yureru
Tada hitori mo gaku
Asu ga sukete mieru

Omae no ikikata ja
Mirai wa nanimo kawaranai
Onore no genkai wo shiru dake

[Chorus:]
There is no time in your life
Fall in the dark
You do not know the truth of your life
Live in the dark
I will see the way to go
You understand
I hate you and you hate me so

[Refrain]

[chorus]
