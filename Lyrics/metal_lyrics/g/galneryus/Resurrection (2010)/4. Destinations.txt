Last night I saw a dream
I was flying over the sky
I heard someone's scream
It was my own loud outcry

Where do you go? Where do you flow?
Where do you come from?
"Can you answer?"
"Yes, I can answer! How 'bout that!"
Run from here Move form here
What can you always hear?
"Can you answer?"
"Yes, I can do that!"

I have the conviction
I have a special power
There is a little friction
I'm in no hurry, it's over

Why do you cry? What do you try?
What do you watch with your eyes?
"Can you answer?"
"Yes, I can answer! How 'bout that!"
Where do you go? where do you flow?
How can you always know?
"Can you answer?"
"Yes, I can do that!"

I'll catch a rainbow in the dark
I can do it, I feel it
I'll erase a memory in the dark
I can do it, I feel it
It's not only in a dream
I can really fly tonight
Destinations where I can go anytime, oh yeah!

I'll catch a rainbow in the dark
I can do it, I feel it
I'll erase a memory in the dark
I can do it, I feel it
The time does not wait for you
You should do it nowâyou feel it
You'll catch a rainbow, too
While we live, we'll never forget faith
You can go to the place you wanna go at anytime
I can go to the placeâI wanna go at anytime
