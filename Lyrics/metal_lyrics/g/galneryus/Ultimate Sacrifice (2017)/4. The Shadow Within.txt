[RÅmaji:]

Kidzukeba shikkoku no yami
Fukikaeshita kodÅ
Nodo seru sajin o kakiwake
Sono toki mita shinjitsu

Ushinawa re yuku hikari
Imada kidzukanu ikari
Furueru yubi o nobashite
Sono shunkan mita shinjitsu

Kotoba nado imi mo naku
No more hesitation
Ano chikai no moto ni
Faith in creation
Ima hirake shikai ni
Subete utsushite yuku

Ima koso machikogareta
Subete o nigiru toki
Tatakai no hate ni tsukanda
Kono hata o kakageyo
