No way!
Evil!
(I) lose control of myself
No way!
Marvel!
I'm not feeling myself

The tragic fact
(I) can't believe that
Sadness I feel intense anger
The certain fact
(I) can't believe that
Darkness
But I must go ahead

No way!
Fiction!
I was tricked by him
No way!
Action!
I can't forgive him

The tragic fact
(I) can't believe that
'Oh, you rat!'
I feel intense anger
The certain fact
(I) can't believe that
Grievous cry...
But I thrust ahead

My destiny is cruel for me
(I've) lost my dearest ones
(and) now I knew the truth
Unbearable pain
(Falls on like rain)
It's endless pain
(Caught in a chain)
Cry out!
(More out loud)
It's his wrongful deed

My destiny is awful for me
(I) think about the meaning of my fight again
It's a crisis
(Under curses)
What's the justice?
(Fall of justice)
Cry out!
(More out loud)
By his wrongful deed

Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Many of men died
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Realized it all
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Many of men died
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Realized it all

What's going on...
(It's) not nearly dawn
Sadness
I feel intense anger
Who's crying now...
I wander now
Darkness
But I must go ahead

My destiny is cruel for me
(I've) lost my dearest ones
(and) now I knew the truth
Unbearable pain
(Falls on like rain)
It's endless pain
(Caught in a chain)
Cry out!
(More out loud)
It's his wrongful deed

My destiny is awful for me
(I) think about the meaning of my fight again
It's a crisis
(Under curses)
What's the justice?
(Fall of justice)
Cry out!
(More out loud)
By his wrongful deed

Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Many of men died
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Realized it all
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
Many of men died
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
I realized!
Dark Side!
Genocide!
Mortified!
With pride!
I'll still fight more
