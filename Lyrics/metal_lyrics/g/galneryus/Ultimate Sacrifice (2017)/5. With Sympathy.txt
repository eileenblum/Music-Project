Is there the end?
Days of the fight...
(But) I have the justice
I'll win the day!
And I met them
They who fight
Struggling for freedom
Never run away

Blood, sweat, many tears
The sword which was damaged
We understand each other in the fight
Promise!
Keep going forward and go!

Look up at the sky
And I pray
My fight'll be over
I'll win the day!

Rage, pain, many fears
The fist which was damaged
We understand each other in the fight
Take an oath!
Keep going forward and go!

So we unite
Open the future
My mind with their mind
Cry of my soul
Cry of their soul
When I fell them something new was born
(I) can't go back from here
Overcome all difficulties
(I) can't stop keep moving
Do not forget my faith
Nothing can disturb me until the end of my life
Nothing can hinder me until the end of my life

Blood, sweat, many tears
The sword which was damaged
Crush, march, many years
I have a lot of courage
Rage, pain, many fears
The fist which was damaged
We understand each other in the fight
Promise!
Keep going forward and go more!

So we unite
Open the future
My mind with their mind
Cry of my soul
Cry of their soul
When I fell them something new was born
(I) can't go back from here
Overcome all difficulties
Without giving up
I do not take a rest
(I) can't stop keep moving
Do not forget my faith
Without getting down
Overcome all difficulties
Nothing can disturb me until the end of my life
Nothing can hinder me until the end of my life
