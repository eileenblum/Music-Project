'Run! Hide in the darkest shadow
So we don't get caught by them
Don't be deceived
Run! Now go away down to below
We just don't want to get hurt
Do not be caught in their traps'

Aiming at the hiding place
Hurry up! Can't lose this race
I try hard at my own pace
(I think about how I deceive)
Even if I'm dripping wet
Take care not to get upset
I don't wanna have regrets
(I think about how I deceive)

Anyway, I want to win
My effort is not in vain
I'll give you intense pain
