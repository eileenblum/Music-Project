Out in the dark, deploring your destiny?
Light is the mark and a ray of hope. Can't you see?

'Rise! Hail! Applause!'
Leave your doubts and take in with no fear.
'Rise! Hail! Applause!'
Seek your mind and feel the lord is here.

You're in the maze of your morality and you're grieving over your fateâ¦
Waiting to be relieved from the banality of the life you have so blindlyâ¦

You'll see the light starts to fall upon you and the Guide will lead to the gate.
Open your eyes and mind until the lord shall speak to you through your mind.

Open your eyes and mind until the lord shall speak to you through your mind.

'Through your mind, here I come.
Want you to say you'll give my soul your soul.
('Want you to save my soul.')
And show me how miseries of your life would taste.'

'Here is your salvation!'

'Give away your only hope!
Why don't you say you give my soul your soul!
('Why don't you save my soul?')
Now, you will get what you have wished for so long.'

'Follow me?'
