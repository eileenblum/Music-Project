[Music by Syu, Lyrics by Yama-B]

I don't care that you're feeling bad
No one can play with my mind
Fighting for the right everyday
But I cannot take that yet
When I was a young boy, they said
"You're only getting older"
But there was a limit in their opinion
In my life, the trouble is full

I'm living for today Show me the way to go
I just feel the noise No one can save my mind
I'm living for today Show me the way to go
Always play with the devil
Hey, can you follow me?

Don't touch It's not an easy game
Don't touch It's not an easy game

In the end, I drop out from the town
Everyone laughed at me
Fighting for my right everyday
But I cannot take that yet
When I raised my hand in your side
You tried to cut with you knife
There's nothing to believe in
In my life, the trouble is full

I'm living for today Show me the way to go
I just feel the noise No one can save my mind
I'm living for today Show me the way to go
Always play with the devil
Hey, can you follow me?

Don't touch It's not an easy game
Don't touch It's not an easy game
