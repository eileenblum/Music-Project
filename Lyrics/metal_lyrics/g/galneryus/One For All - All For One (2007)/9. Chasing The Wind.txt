[Music by Syu, Lyrics by Yama-B]

Alone, I had lost my way
You gave your love to me every time
Chasing the wind
I feel your love in the air
So, all I need is you
But your soul is in the wind
I'm there for you
I ain't gonna leave you

Do you remember the days?
We lived on the edge of the world
Now I just lost the days of suffering and love
We had been looking for the tail of the warmness showing the way
We always spent the days of suffering and love

When the dream had been over
I tried to understand my life
I'll be there for you, your love and your soul in the wind

Alone, I had lost my way
You gave your love to me every time
Chasing the wind
I feel your love in the air
So, all I need is you
But your soul is in the wind
I'm there for you
I ain't gonna leave you

Can you feel the seasons?
In the end, the time will tell
I know you lost the days of suffering and love
If you can't go on anymore, you don't give up to live
We always spent the days of suffering and love

When the dream had been over
I tried to understand my life
I'll be there for you, your love and your soul in the wind

Alone, I had lost my way
You gave your love to me every time
Chasing the wind
I feel your love in the air
So, all I need is you
But your soul is in the wind
I'm there for you
I ain't gonna leave you

Chasing the wind, I remember you
Tracing your life, I'm begging you
Chasing the wind, I remember you
I'll be there for you
Your love and your soul

Alone, I had lost my way
You gave your love to me every time
Chasing the wind
I feel your love in the air
So, all I need is you
But your soul is in the wind
I'm there for you
I ain't gonna leave you
