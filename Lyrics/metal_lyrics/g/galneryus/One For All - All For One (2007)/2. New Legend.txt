[Music by Syu, Lyrics by Yama-B]

Hear the voice of the world
Time is calling me
I will see the new legend in the heat
I'm searching for the break in the moonlight
Trying to escape the dark, it's my mission

Can't you see?
Feel a hunger burning deep inside
I'm a devil fighting with my spells
My voice will take me to the sky

I must win through in this cruel game
I will see the new legend in the heat
Do you have the means of keeping your life?
Trying to escape the dark, it's my mission

Can't you see?
Feel a hunger burning deep inside
I'm a devil fighting with my spells
My voice will take me to the sky
Break out!

Now my time has come again
Bringing me back my life again
Listen closely it's all around
The way to make me free
Now my time has come again
Bringing me back my life again
Take the saber that is by your side
Run through the fields of rage
