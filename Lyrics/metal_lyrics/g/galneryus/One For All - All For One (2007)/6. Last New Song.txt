[Music by Syu, Lyrics by Yama-B]

Silent scream in the heat of night
Hear the voice of your deep inside
I call on you
Can't you hear my voice?
I'm standing alone

Fight for your life, it's destiny
Face the world of your deep inside
Flash of steel makes you feel so new
I'm standing alone

Now, the newest century has begun
Take my hand, if you catch my voice again
Like a flame, my soul is burning hard
Keep on standing in the fields
I will be back from the place of the gloom

Close to me
Don't look back in anger
Please touch me and tell me what you want
Close to me
Don't look back in anger
You should go with me now
You'll hear the last new song

Prime of your life is in this time
Hear the voice of your deep inside
I call on you
Can't you hear my voice?
I'm standing alone

Now, the newest century has begun
Take my hand, if you catch my voice again
Like a flame, my soul is burning hard
Keep on standing in the fields
I will be back from the place of the gloom

Close to me
Don't look back in anger
Please touch me and tell me what you want
Close to me
Don't look back in anger
You should go with me now
You'll hear the last new song
