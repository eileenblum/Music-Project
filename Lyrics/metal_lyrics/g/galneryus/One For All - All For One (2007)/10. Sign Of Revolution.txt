[Music by Yuhki, Lyrics by Yama-B]

Now it's the time, take hold of the flag
Liberty is calling you
Your heart is beating so fast
Breaking the dark, we gather tonight
The passion will make you take your way
Now ready to fight

Sail away, across the sea of madness
The hardness of the burning steel is by my side

Raising your hand, take hold of the flag
Even if I will lose my life, you don't stop your fight
Under command, we gather tonight
The faith of the steel
We pray to bring near the new legend

Sail away, across the sea of madness
The hardness of the burning steel is by my side
Follow on the sign

In the holy night
We got a sign of revolution
Passing through the night
The vision is like the invitation
Take the force to tight
We got a sign of revolution
Now you take the prime time

In the holy night
We got a sign of revolution
Passing through the night
The vision is like the invitation
Take the force to tight
We got a sign of revolution
We'll win through in this game

We just follow the sign
We want to know what's the end of time
