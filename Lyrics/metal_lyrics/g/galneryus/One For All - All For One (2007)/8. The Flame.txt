[Music by Yama-B, Lyrics by Yama-B]

I don't wanna know where my life is going
I'm living on the edge I can't take any more

I submit to the rage again
Don't leave me Stay with me
When you cut my body with your knife tonight,
I'll be free

Fly over night since the day you stole my heart
I'm searching for live I'm in the crowd
See the flame in my eyes
Fly over night since the day you stole my heart
I'm searching for love

I just wanna know where my life is going
I'm living in vain I've lost my way to go

Inside of me, there is a dark
I run away from my sin
When you cut my body with your knife tonight,
I'll be free

Fly over night since the day you stole my heart
I'm searching for live I'm in the crowd
See the flame in my eyes
Fly over night since the day you stole my heart
I'm searching for love in the sleepless night
