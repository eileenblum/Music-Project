The enemy comes to the striking distance
It's a menace I must shatter the silence
I think about the way things stand
I'll decide to fight for my own hand
He is forcing his own ideas on me
It's a menace I do not wanna agree
I must fight but it's far from easy
I wanna win but I can not play dirty

Oh, where is this?
Is this place where I'm supposed to be?
I have the courage of my convictions
Pluck up courage
No fear

Oh, I have spirit of steel
I want more the flesh of steel
I wanna go my way
I don't want to be interfered by him
from now on
I wanna go my way
Oh, I have spirit of steel

The enemy comes from my rear and front
It's a menace I'm all right at the moment
I must fight but It's far from easy
I wanna win but I can not play dirty

Oh. how I should do?
How can I get over the difficulty?
I have the courage of my convictions
Pluck up the courage
No fear

Oh, I have spirit of steel
I want more the flesh of steel
I wanna go ahead
I've seen the way to go
I can go without hesitation
I wanna go ahead
Oh, I have spirit of steel

Oh, where is this?
Is this place where I'm supposed to be?
I have the courage of my convictions
Pluck up courage
No fear

Oh, I have spirit of steel
I want more the flesh of steel
I wanna go my way
I don't want to be interfered by him
from now on
I wanna go my way
Oh, I have spirit of steel
I wanna go ahead
I have spirit of steel
