The sky is so bright and I'm standing alone
I was parted from you and I'm walking alone
I know it's not from you but I'll pick up the phone
I was parted from you and I'm on sandstone

I feel very lonely
I miss you
My only mistake is that I let you go on that day

Wander around looking for you night and day
But I can never find you I find the memories of you
The memories of the days are fading away
The wind blows against my heart I'm looking for you

I wanted to detain you But you said "Goodbye"
I was parted from you and so I asked you "Why?"
You have a tender heart and you have gentle eyes
I was parted from you and now I always sigh

I feel very lonely
I miss you
My only mistake is that I let you go on that day

I remember the night with you I saw a vision
Though I can never find you I find the memories of you
The good old days that we spent were the fiction?
The wind blows against my heart I'm looking for you

Wander around looking for you night and day
But I can never find you I find the memories of you
The memories of the days are fading away
The wind blows against my heart I'm looking for you

I remember the night with you I saw a vision
Though I can never find you I find the memories of you
The good old days that we spent were the fiction?
The wind blows against my heart I'm looking for you
