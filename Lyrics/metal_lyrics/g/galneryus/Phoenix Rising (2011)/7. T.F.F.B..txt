When I'm sad, I remember you
When you are sad, what can I do?
I've met you and I knew the joy
I want you to feel a lot of joy

Even if the wind blows, you must not lose
You look good with a smile than tears
At anytime, I offer words of cheer
I keep my promise Never lose Ah---!

"Trust" It can change our lives and support your life
"Fate" You can see the matter in the correct light
We keep believing our future world
It was getting to be daylight

I wanna know that you expect
I want you to know what I expect
I;ve met you and I knew the fun
I want you to feel a lot of fun

Even if you hesitate, you must not lose
You have an important thing
At anytime, you are looking so good
I keep my promise Never lose Ah---!

"Faith" It makes our bonds strong and support your life
"Blessed" You will be always given it and it's your life
We keep believing our future world
It was getting to be daylight

"Trust" It can change our lives and support your life
"Fate" You can see the matter in the correct light
We keep believing our future world
It was getting to be daylight
