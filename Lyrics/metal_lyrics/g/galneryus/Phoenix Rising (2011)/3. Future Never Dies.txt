[Romaji:]

Moshi kimi ga ano toki
Kinou dake de mo
Ano basho ni ikanakatta to shitara

Kimi no tsuita uso ga
Sugisatte mo
Okizari ni sareta kioku ni naru

Tozaketa in janai "I wanna feel your heart"
Wasuretai wakede mo nai "I can' t forget you"
Itsumo soba ni atta egao Soredake kanjitai

When I walk alone without you
I wish you were by my side
Itsu made mo soba ni ite

Kimi o terashi teru
Mugen no hikari
Ima mo kagayai teru yo

Someday time will tell you where you should go
Future never dies

Subete ga atta kono basho de
Namida dake ga
Kawakazu ni nagare tsuzukete tara

Kimi wa nani o omoudarou
Hitori ni natte
Shimatte mo asu wa yattekuru

Kanawanai n janai "I wanna know the truth"
Mitometai wakede mo nai "I never forget you"
Itsumo soba ni atta egao Soredake wasurenai
When I walk alone without you
Oh, I wish you were by my side
Itsu made mo soba ni ite

Kimi o mamouteru
Mugen no hikari
Ima mo kagayaite iru yo

Someday time will tell you where you should go
