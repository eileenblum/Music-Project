I feel so good seeing you raise your hands
And shake your body all night long
Let me tell you something. That's our band
Let's sing and dance all night long
I can do magic of miracles
I'll take you to the heaven
I will give you blissful time 
You'll be lievened!

Are you tired of your life?
Do you feel really so?
You've met me now
Do not think about the strange things
But you make a racket and enjoy your night
Just like me, shout as always
"Power!" "Devour!" Ah----!

Let's make noise more and more
You can forget your pain 
I can't wait anymore
You don't need to refrain
Let's make noise more and more 
It doesn't come again
You must tear off your chain
Shake your brain

Do you wanna explore the end of the time
I'll take you to the heaven
Oh, I will give you the blissful time
You'll be livened!

You say "I don't like myself" Really so?
You've met me now
Do not think about the strange things
But you make a racket and enjoy your night
Just like me, shout as always
"Stand Up!" "Get Up!" Ah----!!

Let's make noise more and more
You can forget your pain 
I can't wait anymore
You don't need to obtain
Let's make noise more and more 
It doesn't come again
You must tear off your chain
Shake your brain
