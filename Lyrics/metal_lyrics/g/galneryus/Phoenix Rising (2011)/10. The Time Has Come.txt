I can't stand anymore
I can't see anything at all
Only feel wind blowing
I can't think anymore
I think no one can help my soul
There is no god no way out

When I cried throughout the time
The man like a warrior came close to me
and screamed

The time has come
It's time to wake your soul up again
Just trust me
Release your chained hands all of you

We'll never die
Even if your soul is still crying
Tomorrow'll come
Pick up your rusty sword again

The man continued screaming
He said to me "Take the flag again"
What was the flag? Just a cloth?
I asked him, then he said
"Remember what you've fought against"
There is god There's only one way

Finally I realized
A cloth was not just a cloth
So I raise my flag proudly

The time has come
It's time to wake your soul up again
Just trust me
Release your chained hands all of you

We'll never die
Even if your soul is still crying
Tomorrow'll come
Pick up your rusty sword again
