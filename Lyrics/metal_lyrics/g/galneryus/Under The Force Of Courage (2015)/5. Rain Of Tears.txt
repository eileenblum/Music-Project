[I. Reminiscence]

[II. Rain Of Tears]

As sworn allies, we fight Never been apart
Winning is the only way For us to live
Those of who lost their lives Live in our minds
Everything I have seen Still not the past
Grieving rain of tears (Rain of tears)
Just falling on me (Falling on me)
Piercing my heart It flows to the sea (To the sea)
Grieving rain of blood (Rain of blood)
Just wearing for me (Wearing for me)
Dying my soul And it flows to the sea

[III. Nightmare]

[IV. Endless Confliction]

Darkness
Sadness
Madness
Ruthless
Endless
Confliction

(Wanna) go away
Far away
Run away
Turn away my hideous memories
We both swear that we'll fight forever
It fills us with energy
Darkness
Sadness
Madness
Ruthless
Endless
Confliction
(Wanna) go away
Far away
Run away
Turn away my hideous memories
We both swear that we'll fight forever
It fills us with energy
The time's ready for a sortie again
We will lead to the win

[V. Rain of Tears (Reprise)]

As sworn allies, we fight
Never been apart
Winning is the only way
For us to live
Those of who lost their lives
Live in our minds
Everything I have seen
Still not the past
Grieving rain of tears (rain of tears)
Just falling on me (falling on me)
Piercing my heart
It flows to the sea (to the sea)
Grieving rain of blood (rain of blood)
Just wearing for me (wearing for me)
Dying my soul
And it flows to the sea
