We advanced to the darkness
Modoru koto no deki nai michi o
We knew the reason to live
Tada hitotsu iku beki basho he
We fought against the madness
Furiorosare ta musuu no ha
Sono sukima o toorisugi te yuku kuroi kage

Betrayer!
Why did you betray?
Betrayer!

Samayou kokoro
Ugomeku haitoku no uzu
Sign of the sorrow, I can't forgive you
Tadayou ishiki
Kotoba sae ushinaiyuku

I can't hide my weakness
Me no mae ni hirogaru uso ga
I lost the reason to live
Kiesariyuku shinjitsu no shirube

Betrayer!
Why did you betray?
Betrayer!
