[Lyricist: Syu &amp; Taka]
[Composer: Syu]

In this world, where slavery is common.
When a cold war between two great nations ended with a conflict, war broke out.
Slaves become the most convenient resource of conscripts,
There is one slave who was drafted because of his high physical ability.
This is a story of a man who was forced to stand for his country;
By giving victory, he is promised to be free from slavery.
Sent to the field he can never lose;
At the mercy of time,
Struggles against his fate,
Not to protect the national dignity.
But just to protect his wife and his loved ones.
Now, he raises his sword under the force of courage.
