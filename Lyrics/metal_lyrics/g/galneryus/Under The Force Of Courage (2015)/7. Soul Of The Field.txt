Now's the time I slash at you with my sword
I change my sorrow into power
å±ã«æ²ããç­ã®æãæ­ã¡åãçº

There's no way to keep a promise 'cause I have to win my honor
Why did you try to do that?
There's no way to keep a promise 'cause I have to guard my life
Why did you tell a lie to me?

Soul of the field and dust of the field

I'd believed you all the time but you betrayed
I thought that our faith was the same

[Romaji:]

Now's the time I slash at you with my sword
I change my sorrow into power
Tomoni kakage ta hazu no omoi tachikiru tame

(There's no way to keep a promise, 'cause I have to win my honor!)
Why did you try to do that?
(There's no way to keep a promise, 'cause I have to guard my life!)
Why did you tell a lie to me?

Soul of the field, and dust of the field
Tsuukoku osoikakaru
Soul of my sword â fragment of my soul
Chigau asu omi teita

I'd believed you all the time but you betrayed
I thought that our faith was the same
Tomoni kachitoru hazu no risou o tachikiru tame

(There's no way to keep a promise, 'cause I have to win my honor!)
Why did you try to do that?
(There's no way to keep a promise, 'cause I have to guard my life!)
Why did you tell a lie to me?

Soul of the field, and dust of the field
Kono mi ni osoikakaru
Soul of my sword â fragment of my soul
Sugaru asu omi teita

[Solo]

Kanashimi to nageki mune ni hime
Wazuka na nozomi takushifuruu
Hitan o sakebi kun ni negau
Tatoe kono mi akaku some te mo

Kurushimi to itami mune ni hime
Kasuka na nozomi takushikakeru
Kodama suru saigo no sakebi wa
Tooku setsunaku hibii te yuku

Soul of the field and dust of the field
Kono mi ni osoikakaru
Soul of my sword â fragment of my soul
Sugaru asu omi teitaâ¦
