[Chorus:]
(The) voice of grievous cry
We must go forward
(The) grief of a cloudy sky
What should we do?
Just go to the fate?
(The) voice of grievous cry
We must fight against
Let us free from pain
Where is justice?
Distracted by sorrow...

I was walking slowly toward the boundless future
(I) fought day by day, (and even) fought against solitude
Suddenly you appeared in front of me
You and I were in much the same situation

[Pre-chorus:]
Certainly we can't change the past
But we can shape our future
We have no time to feel sadness
Only feel our burning soul

[Chorus]

(The) road goes on endlessly to destination
You and I are in much the same situation

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Certainly we can't change the past
But we can shape our future
We have no time to feel sadness
Go faster...
Only feel our burning soul

[Chorus 2x]
