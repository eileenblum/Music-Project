In the clinging rain, I'll wake up
No one can fly
But I'll take a flight with your wings tonight
Never lose hope for the future
No one hates you
I just feel your warmth in your smile tonight

My Angel, don't you cry no more
I'll never leave you - I need you, don't you cry
You know I can't take any more
I'll go insane - My Angel, heal my heart

I will stay beside you 'til the end
Don't cry
Search for wings, surely you can find
Fly high

How you heal me with your eyes
Sign of the hope
I just feel your warmth in your smile tonight

My Angel, don't you cry no more
I'll never leave you - I need you, don't you cry
You know I can't take any more
I'll go insane - My Angel, heal my heart

I will stay beside you 'til the end
Don't cry
Search for wings, surely you can find
Fly high

Tell me what you see
We'll live in this magical world
If you're gone, I can't go on
My Angel, you grab my heart
I can't stand it so I can't leave you

I will stay beside you 'til the end
Don't cry
Search for wings, surely you can find
Fly high
