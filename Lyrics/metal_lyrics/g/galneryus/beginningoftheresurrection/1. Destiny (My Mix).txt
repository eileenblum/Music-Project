Destiny is calling you, passing through your edge of heart
We're not a loss anymore, and look up your future
And surely, we'll unite once again
We're filled with power
Don't lose the past
Gone with the steel

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

Destiny is calling you, but you don't believe it
Keeper of the resurrection is standing alone
And surely, we'll unite once again with strong faith
Live to surviveâlive for my life
Just likeâ¦those stars!
