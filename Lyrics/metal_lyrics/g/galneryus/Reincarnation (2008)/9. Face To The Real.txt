Now I just wonder why the star is shining so bright
Please tell me, whom is there power of universe for
Look at the ground
It's the world that seems to have lost light
Under starlit sky, we are in the cruel world

Dreadful mine
Refugees occur
Neverending confusion
Beware of the night
You'll feel the fear
You know the time has come

Oh, please forgive us who are sinful greedily
Cry out in the field
Realize in a disturbance

It's like walking through a minefield, we're caught in the dark
(now I just wonder why I haev to suffer the pain)
On through the night, You must pray to escape from the gloom
(Please tell me, whom is there a struggle with slackness for)
Look at the ground, it's the world that seems to have lost light
(Face to the real but you don't give up Hardshp will come)
Under starlit sky, we are in the cruel world
(Plaesea tell me, whom is there a struggle with slackness for)

Search for the way
The way to your life
Ride on and don't be late
Beware of the night
You'll feel the fear
You know my time has come

Oh, the feeling of hate kills your heart and cracks your brain
Cry out in the field
And you fight for your life

Face to the real
But you don't give up
Hardship will come
No way to hide
A tragedy goes
They kill each other
You leave hell
And you for forward
You just hear the spell in the silent night
Prime of time is coming to the ground of the war

You just hear the spell in the silent night
Prime of time is coming to the ground of the war
