I'm watching the scene
Impudent man sneers
Honest man is blamed
I'm disgusted
I don't understand what's right and what's wrong

They want to judge the people living hard every day
Repeating years of past
Playing with the dark
They want to judge the people who are going to be free
Polluting years of past
Try to listen to your heart
Can you feel your evilness
Are you sure to live justly
You are the same as me

Somebody else is sacrificed
All of us stand on the earth of corpse
Play with the joy of the meaningless in the night of ignorance
Somebody else is sacrificed
All of us stand on the earth of corpse
Play with the joy of the meaningless in the night of ignorance

Rain falls down
But my dishonor isn't wiped out
All I need is miracle
I'm disgusted
I don't understand what's right and what's wrong

They want to change the world
Only temporary pleasure
Polluting years of past
Try to listen to your heart
Can you fell your evilness
Are you sure to live justly
You are the same as me

Striding out
My heart is beating so fast
Morning light is rising up for me
Striding out
My heart is beating so fast
now the time to fight
