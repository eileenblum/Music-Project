Cold wind brushes your face
Your temperature is going low
A falling leaf is meaning your life
There is no time for you

It's like a fire in the storm
Your hesitation is fatal
Find the way to safe your mind
There is no time for you

There is no way out and no where to hide
On through the night, you must go on
Time after time, you will see the nightmare
Rush is the last means left by you

Taste the blood of your friends
You are just in a balme game
Feel the fire of anger
Repentance comes too late

It's like a fire in the storm
Your hesitation is fatal
Find the way to safe your mind
There is no time for you

In too much dispute, the truth will be lost
You have to truth only yourself
Time after time, you will see the nightmare
Rush is the last means left by you

Wind of change animated the flag
Drastic revolution is in this time
Never lose the truth of steel
Never lose the mind of a warrior
Kill the apin
You'll see the dawn of freedom

Wind of change animated the flag
Drastic revolution is in this time
Never lose the truth of steel
Never lose the mind of a warrior
Kill the apin
You'll do the best and find the answer
