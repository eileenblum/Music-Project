Do you know a sad fact of a victim
Their life is wasted for our life
How is this comfortable system
We just overlook something

It may have been a mistake
It may have been necessary
There may have been difficulties
Now the time that we express gratitude to everything
Oh please pray heartily to the soul

kaze no naka de kieyuku negai
sugu soba niaru koe ni
kizukazu warai atte
ushinaware teku hakanaki negai
itsuka omoi dashi tai
ano hi no nukumori wo

Do you know a sad fact of abuse
Their life is wasted for our life
How was the experiment done
We just overlook something

It may have been a mistake
It may have been necessary
There may have been difficulties
Now the time that we express gratitude to everything
Oh please pray heartily to the soul

Kaze no naka de kogoeru inochi
Okizari ni sareta yume
Shizuka ni me wo tojiru
Tsumetai ame ni obieru inochi
Itsuka omoi dashi tai
Ano hi no nukumori wo

Kaze no naka de mitsuketa hikari
Kanata no hoshi akari ni kono te wo sashi nobete
Shinnjiru mama ni sasageru inori
Itsuka omoi dashi tai
Ashita e tsuzuku michi

Stardust is falling down to the ground
We found small light in the wind
We raise our hands for the starlight
We pray with reverence
Stardust is falling down to the ground
We found small light in the wind
We raise our hands for the starlight
