Indelible disgrace
Nobody touch you
And you walk alone
When you find another way
It's the day that you must receive the voice

You just notice you have greed
Can you feel me
I wait for you
When you find another way,
Take hold of the flame and shine up your way

A better way, it's always far away from us
But I don't give up pursuit
A fairy tale, it always heals your broken heart
No time to wait for you

The Smiel never returns
You were discouraged
And you live alone
When you find another way
Take hold of the flame and shine up your way

Oh, the days of glory won't return
Now you shed tears in the silent night
Oh, the days of brightness won't return
Now the time to take the holy light
It's so shining bright
Your definitely aim is here
You take the holy light
It's so shining bright
Your definitely aim is here

You take the holy light
It's so shining bright
Your definite aim is here
You take the holy light
It's so shining bright
Your definitely aim is here
