Human life has continued for centuries
Don't you cry
When one life is over
You should welcome a birth of new life
Watch through the repetition of birth and death

Take hold of the flag
You believe in the glory of fate
Break through the wall of ignorance
The time of a blessing has come

Look up the sky
The new flag is calling you
Into the fifth field
You try to break free
Look up the sky
The new flag is calling you
All begin to notice the fact
We believe in reincarnation under the flag

We know that the new life will be our leader
The soul of ancient people will keep the ways of our life

Meditation in the silent night
The soul of ancient people will keep the ways of our life

We believe in reincarnation
We believe in reincarnation
We believe in reincarnation under the flag
