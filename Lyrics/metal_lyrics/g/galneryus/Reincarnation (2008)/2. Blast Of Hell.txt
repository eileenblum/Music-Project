Take the flag in the blast of hell
On Judgment day, you'll fear the time to die

From the sea, I just feel the dirty lump
Nobody can prevent the pollution
Potential hatred will choke me to death
This relation is spoiled by this fact

Keep the trust
Even if we can fall in hell
Before all of the hope is over by the blast of hell
Keep the trust
Even if we just lose our way
Don't be blind
Take the ride
We go against the blast of hell

Take attention
Somebody aims at you
Don't touch the lump
The concealed evilness
Take attention
We'll see the blast of hell
Calling on you
Don't look back tonight

On Judgement day, you'll fear the time to die
A merciless crime, so we'll never forget
Pray for the victims
I curse my fate
This relation is spoiled by this fact

Keep the faith
Even if we can fall in hell
We can survived the crises of life
It's the blast of hell
Keep the faith
Even if we just lose our way
Never lose hope for your life
Go against the blast of hell

Take the flag in the blast of hell
On judgement day, you'll fear the time to die
You must take the flag in the blast of hell
Can you feel the pain
