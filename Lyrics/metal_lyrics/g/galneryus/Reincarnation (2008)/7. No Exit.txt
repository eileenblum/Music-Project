Enumerated dead bodies of the blood brothers
To the place which is farther than this place
A long way off
Make the road which follows our glorious life
Even if holy sacrifice is necessary

The weight brought sorrow to us
When I held their bodies
The weight brought regret to us
When I saw the fact

We work without ever doubting the present conditions
To the place which is farther than this place
A long way off
The crowd of people are walking the road holding their
brothers
Dearest people alraedy lost their temperature

For what the road is
For whom the sweat is
I cannot wipe the doubt out
Praying is the only way we can go
The pain is getting worse
We don' know whether our future is so glorious or not
But we know there is no exit
