Yes, I am a soldier
Promise I'll always fight in the cause of justice
But I don't do it by order
I'm always an enemy to injustice

Voices crying in the wilderness
Somebody is asking for my help
Voices crying in the darkness
Somebody is asking for my help
"Save us from hell!"

Yes, I am a saver
I don't have the heart to ignore people in need
Never change my mind forever
Follow me without fear I am in the lead

Voices crying in the painfulness
Somebody is asking for my help
Voices crying in hard sadness
Somebody is asking for my help
"Save us from pain!"

Rise against! Out loud!
Show you my noble action
Win or lose To be proud
I'll prove my devotion
With a rage like a shroud
I'm ready for action
Feel my riot of emotion
I only fight in the cause of justice
I am an enemy to injustice

Peaceful days once I had were left behind
Now only the fate and tusk are in my hands
I won't look back on days in the past
I won't be down tilI breath my last

Taking all the blames and claims deep inside
Believing all the opponents will be by my side
I will be back over and over again
I will fight back to the final day!

Rise against! Out loud!
Show you my noble action
Win or lose To be proud
I'll prove my devotion
With a rage like a shroud
I'm ready for action
Feel my riot of emotion
I only fight in the cause of justice
I am an enemy to injustice
l only fight in the cause of justice
I am an enemy to injustice
I fight in the cause of justice
I am an enemy to injustice
