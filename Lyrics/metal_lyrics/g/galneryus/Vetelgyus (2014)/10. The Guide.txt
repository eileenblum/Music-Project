Follow me Obey me I'm the guide

A deed of trust Precede, must
Proceed, just No exemption
Greed and lusts Creed will rust
Will mistrust Aberration

Face your foredoom No need to fight
Believe, there will be no disorder
Relieve, so you will see what I say is right
Indeed, there won't be pain Show you the light

Grievance Deviance Defiance Abnegation
Obedience Allegiance Governance I'm a swayer

A breach of trust Turn to dust
So, disgust Abrogation
Need a thrust At the blast
So, will bust Termination

Face your foredoom No need to fight
Believe, there will be no disorder
Relieve, you will see what I say is right
Indeed, there won't be pain Show you the light
Grievance Deviance Defiance Abnegation
Obedience Allegiance Governance I'm a swayer

In the name of justice, future is bright
Behold, your confusion is over
Feel delight is growing makes you excite
I'll be the guide of your world So, behave

Face your foredoom No need to fight
Believe, there will be no disorder
Relieve, so you will see what say is right
Indeed, there won't be pain Show you the brilliant light

Grievance Deviance Defiance Abnegation
Resistance Discordance Dessonance Contradiction
Obeisance Reliance Credence No accusation
Obedience Allegiance Governance Now you're in my hand
