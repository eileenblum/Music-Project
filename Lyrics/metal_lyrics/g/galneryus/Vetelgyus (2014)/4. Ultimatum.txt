Fed up! I don't wanna see your figure Never!
Liar! I can not trust you and don't wanna talk
Break up! I don't wanna hear your words Forever!
Anger! You will be given a great mental shock

The rain comes on lt tears all off Don't notice that
We'll reach a so sad ending I'll tell you flat
I am running out of my time I notice that

Get out my way Don't need the memory
ls this love? I was always hurt by you
Stand away Nothing was good for me
Is this love? I can't believe you anymore

Shut up! I don't undestand your feelings Never!
Anger! You will be given a great mental shock

The storm comes on Destroys all Don't escape from here
We'll reach a so sad ending But I'll fight fair
I'll have to start for a new place I dare to go there

Take all away Now I can not calm down
Is this love? I was always hurt by you
Fade away You said "Don't let me down"
Is this love? I can't believe you anymore Oh!

The rain comes on lt tears all off Don't notice that
We'll reach a so sad ending I'll tell you flat
I am running out of my time I notice that

Get out my way Don't need the memory
ls this love? I was always hurt by you
Stand away Nothing was good for me
ls this love? I can never believe you
Take away Now I can not calm down
ls this love? I was always hurt by you
Fade away You said "Don't let me down"
ls this love? I can't wait you anymore Oh!!
