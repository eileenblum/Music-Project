I choose the one this time
You'll see my faith in neglect
I'll lead you into the straits
Run for your life

I know you won't believe me
But I'll make you go through the process
I know time is no limit for me
Run for your life

Allegiance to the lunatics
Your resentment will change into sweet desire
The past will bring you inebriation

You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
The laziness will swallow all
Until the last oneâs fall
You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
Advance the fight against the dark
You don't let anything get in the way of you

You're an injured soldier
You just hear the sound of silence
You couldn't know this meaning
Run for your life

Path to me, it's your only way
You have to accept my heart
I know the time is no limit for me
Run for your life

Allegiance to the lunatics
Your resentment will change into sweet desire
The past will bring you inebriation

You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
The laziness will swallow all
Until the last one's fall
You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
Advance the fight against the dark
You don't let anything get in the way of you

You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
The laziness will swallow all
Until the last oneâs fall
You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
Advance the fight against the dark
Until the last one's fall

You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
The laziness will swallow all
Until the last oneâs fall
You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
Advance the fight against the dark
Until the last oneâs fall

You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
The laziness will swallow all
Until the last one's fall
You'll hear the growling of the crowd
You know there is no guidepost
Advance the fight against the dark
Until the last one's fall
