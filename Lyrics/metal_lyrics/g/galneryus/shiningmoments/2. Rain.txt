Do you remember the wind
The considerate touch
There's the good old smell
My wish is so plain
It's to touch your face in the morning light

I could think so that our relationship would be eternity
My wish is so plain
It's to hear your voice by your side

I don't know where it's going to lead
I don't know where I am right now

You're gone away
I'm crying in the rain
And I raise my hand to touch your vision
My memories are always there for you
In sorrow, I must find the way

I can't stand any more
You just broke my heart
No one would deny
My wish is so plain
It's to hear your voice by your side

I don't know where it's going to lead
I don't know where I am right now

You're gone away
I'm crying in the rain
And I raise my hand to touch your vision
My memories are always there for you
In sorrow, I must find the way

I am chasing the shade of you
I just got to be alone
A stupid clown, itâs me
There is no mercy with me
I'm crawling in the night

You're gone away
I'm crying in the rain
And I raise my hand to touch your vision
You're gone away
I'm crying in the rain
My wish is so plain
It's to hear your voice
You're gone away
I'm crying in the rain
And I raise my hand to touch your vision
My memories are always there for you
In sorrow, I must find the answer
