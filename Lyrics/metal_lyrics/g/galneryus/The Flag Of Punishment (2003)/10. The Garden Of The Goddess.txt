The agony of human race,
never leave like a shadow
The end of life,
now we can feel the time
Throw the stone to lake of tears
Can you hear the sound of sadness
Remember now,
the pain we took on the road

We want see
some other way,
but we are blind
Give me a light
and show me the way
We still walk alone
I can't fight this feeling

In everything we can feel
the joy of freedom
It's not a dream, I wonder
Let me feel
your heart that full of joy
Now all the game is over

Now got a heat of new legend
We believe the light of freedom
Create your life
Now we can feel the time
Bring the storm of the ancient rage
Can you hear the sound of darkness
Remember now,
the pain we took on the road

We want see
some other way,
but we are blind
Give me a light
and show me the way
We still walk alone
I can't fight this feeling

In everything we can feel
the joy of freedom
It's not a dream, I wonder
Let me feel
your heart that full of joy
Now all the game is over

I can see the light
I can feel the warm
The time is right for changing,
changing yeah
Like a wind, I ride
No one can stop the try
Only we'll go ahead
to the garden of the goddess

In everything we can feel
the joy of freedom
It's not a dream, I wonder
Let me feel
your heart that full of joy
Now all the game is over

Please let me see your garden
The goddess is always
there for you
Please let me see your garden
The goddess is always
there for you
Please let me see your garden [Repeat X3]
