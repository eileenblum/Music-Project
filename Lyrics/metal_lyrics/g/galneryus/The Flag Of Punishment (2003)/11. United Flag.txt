Look the tower, the dictator lives in
He brings us that the fear of the evil
Now the time, we are breaking the chains of pain
We are the one

The end of the long days in vein
Take a free
Breaking through the dark
We will fight in the eternity

United flag
Now we are marching on the way
Our victory has carved in stone
So, it is not a dream
Facing the truth
Now I know what I have to do
No one can stop the power of the free
Shatter the kingdom

In the night, I've been searching the answer
A calling voice have lead us to the land
Gathering of the spirits like burning steel
We are the one

The existence, we believe and keep the faith
Breaking through the dark
We will fight in the eternity

United flag
Now we are marching on the way
Our victory has carved in stone
So, it is not a dream
Facing the truth
Now I know what I have to do
No one can stop the power of the free
Shatter the kingdom

Can't you hear that the wolves are howling
Feel the moon light that bring us the victory

Gathering of the spirits like burning steel
We are the one

The existence, we believe and keep the faith
Breaking through the dark
We will fight in the eternity

United flag
Now we are marching on the way
Our victory has carved in stone
So, it is not a dream
Facing the truth
Now I know what I have to do
No one can stop the power of the free
Shatter the kingdom

United flag...
