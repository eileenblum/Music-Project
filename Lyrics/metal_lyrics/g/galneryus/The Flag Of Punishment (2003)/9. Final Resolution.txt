We hold the swords
Reflecting thunder light
The flame of the torch brightens mighty steel

From the ancient times,
the holy power was told
The last hope which defeats an evil
Now we make up our mind

We judge the tyrant who robbed our honor
Remember the father's fight
Remember the mother's worm
Feel the power that can't be controlled
We hold the swords and tie them to one
As for you, what can be seen in the blaze

The sheep are dominated by the fear
Now we'll break iron cage and coming out

The hope shows us the way
And that covers the world
Wish of our uniting kills any evil

We judge the tyrant who robbed our honor
Remember the father's fight
Remember the mother's worm
Feel the power that can't be controlled
We hold the swords and tie them to one
As for you, what can be seen in the blaze

Remember now
The experience of freedom
We are the one and there's no fear
Only we'll march to take a glory of our life
No one can change our resolution

From the ancient times,
the holy power was told
The last hope which defeats an evil
Now we make up our mind

We judge the tyrant who robbed our honor
Remember the father's fight
Remember the mother's worm
Feel the power that can't be controlled
We hold the swords and tie them to one
As for you, what can be seen in the blaze [Repeat X3]
