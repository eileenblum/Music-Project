Imagine, now you are walking on the ground
The ground is shining with emerald green
There is no fear and there is no war
Child are playing in the bright sunshine

We are believing the world will have to come
The world is peaceful and we can feel the warm
There is no fear and there is no war
Child of free in the bright future

In your eyes, I can see the flame is burning
Now you decide to fight for the freedom
In your eyes, I can see the flame is burning
Fly away, against the wind
On through the night, we'll go on

We can try again
Now the time to cry and fly away
So we will go
We can try again
It is took so long to find the way
We feel the light
We can try again
Now the time to cry and fly away
So we will go on and on
We can try again
It is took so long to find the way
We feel the light

Heading for future, we are moving forward
We endured for the long... long time
There is no fear and there is no war
Child of free in the bright future

In your eyes, I can see the flame is burning
Now you decide to fight for the freedom
In your eyes, I can see the flame is burning
Fly away, against the wind
On through the night, we'll go on

We can try again
Now the time to cry and fly away
So we will go
We can try again
It is took so long to find the way
We feel the light
We can try again
Now the time to cry and fly away
So we will go on and on
We can try again
It is took so long to find the way
We feel the light

In your eyes, I can see the flame is burning...

We can try again...
