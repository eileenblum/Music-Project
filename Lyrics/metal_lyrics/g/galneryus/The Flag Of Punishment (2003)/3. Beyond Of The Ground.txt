Through the sky
I'll fly so fast
Into the chaos of fear
I wanna know
where do we go
What is waiting in my future

We never forget the pain
We never give up
Feeling the body heat

I'll see the destiny
that no one can exit
But we will go

On the road,
I'll see the light
The light is a hope of my life
I wanna know
the world of no pain
Everyone's smiling each other

Spreading the anger of us
We'll break enemy
We will fight till the end
Sticking the blood of the friends
that make us to choice
to fight for all

Faraway
In the night, we'll fly away
Calling of the glorious
Beyond of the ground
Oh, we gaze faraway
In the night, we'll fly away
Calling of the glorious
Beyond of the ground

Through the sky
I'll fly so fast
Into the chaos of fear
I wanna know
where do we go
What is waiting in my future

We never forget the pain
We never give up
Feeling the body heat

I'll see the destiny
that no one can exit
But we will go

Faraway
In the night, we'll fly away
Calling of the glorious
Beyond of the ground
Oh, we gaze faraway
In the night, we'll fly away
Calling of the glorious
Beyond of the ground
