In the future,
the human race is dropped in the cultural level
by the strange power.
and they are always in the agonizing.
The ground is melted
and all plants are approximately exterminated.
The dictator dominates all people by the fear
All hope seems to have been broken off
and all dignity seemed to have been ruined
But a few warriors decide to resist
Holding a raging rage,
they run through with the flag of the rebellion
The story begins. The revolution comes
You'll see the eternal saga of the justice
