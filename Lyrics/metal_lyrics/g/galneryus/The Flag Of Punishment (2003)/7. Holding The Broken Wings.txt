Now I say the word
Feeling of fear fills our mind
but I keep the faith
War cry are shaking the ground
Now the time to fight
Your heart is beating so fast
Now the time to die

Never ending
agony of the human race
I wanna know why
the angels are crying

I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Praying to bring
back the new wings to fly
I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling you
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling

The expiation of the blood
Agony brings the dark
We're trying to end all wars
So we'll keep the faith
Bright of the spark from the sword
That makes me high
Gazing the stars, we decide
to fight for freedom now

Never ending
agony of the human race
I wanna know why
the angels are crying

I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Praying to bring
back the new wings to fly
I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling you
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling

Never ending
agony of the human race
I wanna know why
the angels are crying

I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Praying to bring
back the new wings to fly
I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling you...
I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Praying to bring
back the new wings to fly
I'm waiting
for awake of the world
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling you
Holding the broken wings, I'm calling [Repeat X4]
