See the blood of our friends
that sticking to us
Rising out of the sea of sorrow
There's nothing
to loose anymore

We will be fighting
till we get hold of our victory
Oh my sword leads us
to the castle where the evil lies

The sacrifice was big, but we became stronger
We get hold of glory again
On the road, we will defeat our enemy
even if we'll become the dust

The armors protect our body
and departed souls protect our mind
Now the time,
we'll break through the gate of steel
Into perdition
Struggle for freedom, it's our rule

See the fire of steel
that calling on us
Oh, my sword blaze up
We are children of this battlefield

The sacrifice was big, but we became stronger
We get hold of glory again
On the road, we will defeat our enemy
even if we'll become the dust

[Repeat X2]
The armors protect our body
and departed souls protect our mind
Now the time,
we'll break through the gate of steel
Into perdition
Struggle for freedom, it's our rule

No one can stop the force
that shatters the dark
Rolling like thunder
and run through like lightning

The sacrifice was big, but we became stronger
We get hold of glory again
On the road, we will defeat our enemy
even if we'll become the dust

[Repeat X2]
The armors protect our body
and departed souls protect our mind
Now the time,
we'll break through the gate of steel
Into perdition
Struggle for freedom, it's our rule
