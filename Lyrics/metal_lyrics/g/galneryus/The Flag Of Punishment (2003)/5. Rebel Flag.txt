In a hate, you are crawling
On a road, I'm going
Searching for the safe of your mind
You just feel the confusion

See the cloud of the people
They want a little warmth
The world of sadness that disturb you
It's just real
I can't take anymore

Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
When I had touched you
Your mind had turned to the stone
Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
Feel the end of the world
I don't know what's the truth, what is the right

Without a warning, we face the truth
There's no mercy, the time has come
Searching for the safe of our mind
We just feel the confusion

See the cloud of the warriors
They want a little warmth
The world of sadness that disturb you
It's just real
I can't take anymore

Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
When I had touched you
Your mind had turned to the stone
Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
Feel the end of the world
I don't know what's the truth, what is the right

Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me

Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
When I had touched you
Your mind had turned to the stone
Now I'm calling for you
Why don't you answer for me
Feel the end of the world
I don't know what's the truth, what is the right
