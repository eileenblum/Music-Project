You've got a tough,
and you get tired
No way to runaway, and no one can exit
But now we see the light We feel so new
Oh, mighty steel, we'll burn our hearts

Hiding the treasure of the world
We'll get the glorious
It's took so long to find the way

Fly high,
spreading your wings
Into the field of war and pain
Someday we'll face the end of childhood age
Now rain is over, we'll be smiling
in the delight

On through the night, we will go on
No one can change our mind, we'll fight till the end
The world will have to come
There is no war
Oh, mighty steel, we'll keep the faith

Hiding the treasure of the world
We'll get the glorious
It's took so long to find the way

Fly high,
spreading your wings
Into the field of war and pain
Someday we'll face the end of childhood age
Now rain is over, we'll be smiling
in the delight

Hiding the treasure of the world
We'll get the glorious
It's took so long to find the way

Fly high,
spreading your wings
Into the field of war and pain
Someday we'll face the end of childhood age
Now rain is over, we'll be smiling...
Fly high,
spreading your wings
Into the field of war and pain
Someday we'll face the end of childhood age
Now rain is over, we'll be smiling in the delight
