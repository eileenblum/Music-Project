Far Away, beyond the black sea
A temple of the accursed
Hordes they come, in an endless ride
Called by a distant whisper

A Place so vile
Was hidden in a mist far away
In a valley so vast and deep
Only unholiest cretures were beckoned there

Now they've reached the sacred shrine
They're paying to a Pagan god
Rubing lamb's blood on their chests
They float around a distant fire

A ritual so evil, the bloodiest orgy
That involved the speading of a curse
Vile than mankind know

Waiting in the jungle for the next crucifixion
Bangin skulls from vines in the fermented growth
Voodoo mass a tnight, mordid rituals fullfilled

(chorus)
Voodoo mass,Voodoo mass
Voodoo mass,Voodoo mass
