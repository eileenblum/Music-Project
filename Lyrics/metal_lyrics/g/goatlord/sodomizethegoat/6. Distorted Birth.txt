Distorbed Birt, Incestual Lust
Carnal sin, brought forth ghoul
Hidden chapel, where he dwells
Pagan rites shall be known
Candles lit for his black mass
In the barn his ritual is fulfilled
Smearing goat's blood on his genitals
Eyes are insane, lust for the dead

[Chorus]
Distorbed Birth, Distorbed Birth
Distorbed Birth, Distorbed Birth

In his mind something's wrong
Swellng lump, cause him pain
Perverted ghoul, sees one thing
Women's blood clots his beard

Corpses in mounds behing the barn
Maggots feeding on his offerings

[Repeat chorus]

His sicening rituals, Satanic rites
Brain's deformed
Worshipping Satan, his lust is uncontrolled
Vomiting blood, unholy ritual now deceased

Distorted birth, perverted ghoul
Satanic rites, Bloody orgy

now his deeds are fulfilled
Throbbing tumour disappears
It is time for him to rest
Forever in a darkened alliance
