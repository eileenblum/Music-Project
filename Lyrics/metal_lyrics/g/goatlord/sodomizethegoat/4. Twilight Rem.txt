Crawling bugs pour out of your eyes
Sickening preacher, vomit on his collar
Inverted cross floats above your head
Forever night, will you come back

[Chorus]
Twilight rem
Twilight rem

Deadly dram seems so real
Smells bad, I'm lying in blood
This religion, necrovore's lust
God please tell me I'm not dead

[Repeat chorus]

You wake up ina sweat
But you're lying in a casket
Death is so painless
Come and taste sweet death
You thought that you had seen god's light
But instead you're locked in a realm
Never again will life be the same
Writhing, screaming in an endless nightmare

[Repeat chorus]
