Lie on the altar
Black Prince stands near
Smell the rotting stench
Feel the trembling fear

[Chorus]
Sacrifice of Virgins
Sacrifice of preachers
Sacrifice of children
Sacrifice of all

Unholy voice brought in here
To feast on holy flesh
Seven virgins open wide
Await their final breaths

[Repeat chorus]

Bible thron into Abyss
God exists no more
Staked to cross in glowing Hell
Virgings crying, Virgings weeping
There is no more religion

[Repeat chorus]

Time has come for the rest of you
To join your rotting Hell
All that remains of your soul
Is a putrid smell
