The thirteenht of november
Full moon lights the sky
Ghouls are gather to chant
they summon the fog
The lamb's throat is slt
Blood floods the coffin
Their spehred is here

[Chorus]
The fog
The fog
Black, stinking fog

Now the dead will rise
Floating throught the fog
Clutch on crucifix
The gates begin to open
Finally time has come

The shepherd leads his flock
Into the valley of fog
The will wait for you

[Repeat chorus]
