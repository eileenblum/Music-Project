Blood monk come to my throne
Evil possessd your inner mind
Lives filled with pagan worship
Vultures circle aroung the Black Pool
Dancing in the ritual
Spilling the sweet blood of a lamb
Forgetting the lies of Jesus Christ
Your soul is turning black

[Chorus]
Black shrine is hidden
in a cave of stinking moss
Blood monk is kneeling
At the black altar
He lights the kindling fire
And chants silently to himself
Whispers bestial rites

Now the unholy deeds are done
Return to your rotten master
Blood monk, your soul will forever burn
In the flames of Sodom
