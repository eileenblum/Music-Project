Torches light the sky, as the doom bell tolls 
The gathering of an unholying coven for ritual 
All shall be told, nothing sacred 
The Underground church 
Behind the sacred wall is hidden lust 
The bloodstained steps lead to the shrine 
The chanting is louder, their priest floats 
The underground Church 
Light the candleabra 
Incoke the sacred names in which you pray to 
Open the forgotten passage 
You found the underground church 
Messiah of damned stands bedore his coven 
Offerings of blood and carnage are brought to Him 
Tonite the candles were lit in his name 

The Sacrifice done, Bloodstained altar 
The vows of chaos have been recitedThe godlets are passed in praise of their Lord 
The Underground Chruch
