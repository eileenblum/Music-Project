Coming from earth's core
Death is on a wing
Blackened arise church taking with it
Soldiers revenge from the grave
Possessed soldiers of war
Trying to get free
Master enslaves innocent victims of war
Now not what they were, tormented souls
Darkness their only remorse
Possessed soldiers of war

[Chorus]
Possessed Soldiers of war
Hauning a blackened sky
Back from a lost grave
Forever in limbo at night

Soldiers coming from their graves
Back to take your life
You made them suffer so
You wil pay in time
