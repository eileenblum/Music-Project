Deep in the mist of the enchanted bayou 
Dwellers of the swamp are forming a circle 
Mosquitoes swarm around naked bodies 
They come to drink the blood of the fowl 
As they stand in the dense quagmire 
Witch doctors apply sense of Hell 
Their flesh glissens in the fire 
My eyes bleed as I watch 

Choking on a bone 
Chicken's blood 

Through the smoke I see her tied 
Unable to free her wrists 
They chant and cackle tongue 
The chicken's blood is so sweet 
The sky is calling me to join 
The tribe is standing around the fire 
Payote affects them all 
I must join their weird cult 

Chicken dance 
Choking on chicken's bones 

As you enter the chicken's home 
You will find that you are not 
In his same mind...
