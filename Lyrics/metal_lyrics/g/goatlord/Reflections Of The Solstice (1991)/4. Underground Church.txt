Torches light the sky as doom bell tolls
The gathering of a coven for ritual
All shall be told, nothing sacred
All steps lead to the Underground Church
Behind the sacred wall is hidden lust
The bloodstained steps lead to the shrine
The chanting is louder, their priest floats
All steps lead to the Underground Church
Light the candelabra
Invoke the sacred names
Open the forgotten passage
You found the Underground Church
Messiah of the damned
Stands before his coven
Offerings of blood and carnage
Are brought to him
Tonight the candles were lit
In his name
The sacrifice done, blood stained altar
The vows of chaos have been recited
The goblets are passed in praise of their lord...
