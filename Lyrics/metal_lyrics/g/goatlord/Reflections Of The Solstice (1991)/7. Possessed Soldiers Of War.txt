Lie on the altar
Black prince stands near
Smell the rotting stench
Feel the trembling fear

Sacrifice of virgins
Sacrifice of preachers
Sacrifice of children
Sacrifice of all

Unholy voice brought him here
To feast on holy flesh
Seven virgins open wide
Await their final breath

Bible thrown into abyss
God exists no more
Staked to cross in glowing hell
Virgins crying, virgins weeping
There is no more religion

Time has come for the rest of you
To join our rotting hell
All that remains of your soul
Is a putrid smell...
