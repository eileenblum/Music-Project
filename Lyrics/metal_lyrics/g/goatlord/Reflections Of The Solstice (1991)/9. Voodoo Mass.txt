[USA release bonus track]

Far away, beyond the black sea
A temple of the accursed
Hordes they come, in an endless ride
Called by a distant whisper

A place so vile
Was hidden in a mist far away
In a valley so vast and deep
Only unholiest creatures were beckoned there

Now they've reached the sacred shrine
They're paying to a Pagan god
Rubbing lamb's blood on their chests
They float around a distant fire

A ritual so evil, the bloodiest orgy
That involved the spreading of a curse
Vile than mankind know

Waiting in the jungle for the next crucifixion
Banging skulls from vines in the fermented growth
Voodoo mass at night, morbid rituals fullfilled

Voodoo mass, voodoo mass
Voodoo mass, voodoo mass
