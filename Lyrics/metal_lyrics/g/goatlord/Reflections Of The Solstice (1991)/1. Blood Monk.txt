Blood Monk come to my throne
Evil reels inside your mind
Your life is filled with Pagan worship
Vultures circle around the Black Pool
Dancing in the ritual
Spilling the warm blood of a lamb
Forgotten lies of Jesus Christ
Your soul is turning black...black

[Chorus]
The black shrine is hidden
In a cave of stinking moss
Blood Monk is kneeling
At his black altar
He lights the kindling fire
And chants so silently
He whispers bestial rites

Now your unholy deeds are done
Return to your rotting Master
Blood Monk your soul forever will burn
In the flames of Sodom...Sodom
Dancing in the ritual
Spilling the lamb's blood
Blood Monk you're not God
You're God

Blood Monk
Standing around fire
Praying to your savior
Trinkets desire
Blood Monk come...

Blood Monk

[solo]

Come to the throne of blood
Come to the throne of lies...
