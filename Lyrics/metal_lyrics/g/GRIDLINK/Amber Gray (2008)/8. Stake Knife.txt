Slotted with memory from zero out
Complete fucking dodonpachi
Falling from the sky in pieces
Through the circling rookery
A frayed hairline of murder
That never circles back
It doesn't kill it cripples
And leaves you for the sharks

Tear out your fucking arteries
Armatures on which they're draped
The product of damage control
Politely suffering
Dump your past life
Under voight kampf
Design flaws that give you away
Dumb vessel
Operated
To take the bullet
As I jack out and away
Loading in a stacked deck
And going straight to black
Transparent against the streaming panes
An echelon of pseudonyms
Tunneling day and night
I bounce from life to life
