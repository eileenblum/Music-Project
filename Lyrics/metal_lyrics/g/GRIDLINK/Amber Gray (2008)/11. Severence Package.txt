Target the end users of black tinct death span
The raptors pick the bones clean
Anonymous payments trigger distributed conflicts
Bot herding swarm zombies
Stapled wounds are packed with semtex
Quick clotted with heart worm
The black box that outlives the plane crash
Glares at the wrecked horizon
Shrouded in loam

Failed states mottled with blood
Bulldozed into mass graves
With conflicted interest
The blackened meat between
Garnished with ebola
Cotton mouth spills over
Into my eyes

As the world is over
Discerning mercenaries play their trump
The barbs of a full spectrum war

Put light to oil slicked waters
Watch the blaze cascade
An ocean of fire to occlude my heart
With hate
Cinders of fall out dot the current exit strategy

The fingers of the mantis
Bathed in sarin staunched in gore
