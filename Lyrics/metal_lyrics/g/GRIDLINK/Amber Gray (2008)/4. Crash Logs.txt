Line by line
A redacted record
Of everyone I've been
I scallop chunks to spoof
The kill hounds logged to bin
Arterial black stuffed back inside
A bullet proofed cavity
Capture, catch, execute
This log of purgatory

It comes from your heart
And throws you away

Covered in dirt
I'm spit back out
To the bottom of the world
Dabbed in gore, this cursor writes out
A packet of myself to you
Cynical laughter
Chokes past the tears
