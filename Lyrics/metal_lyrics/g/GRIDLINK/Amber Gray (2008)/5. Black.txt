Jdams slam down zenith angles
Beelining on the painted men
Soaked in fire
The oscilloscoped cowls
Unerring in their selection
Probing with strobes
Evoking a response
Driving insomnia
Diving through a pall
Huddled against
Jet black amnia

Scent of blood in the water
Transmit in the waves
Tunnel past
The chum line
Closing on the prey

Both ends against the middle
At the top of the food chain
Your spears dipped in urine
To kill what we eat

One dead step back into gray

Narcolepsy frosted infra-red
In freshly napalmed wake
Absentee ratio churns
The hanged man's song fills in the blanks
