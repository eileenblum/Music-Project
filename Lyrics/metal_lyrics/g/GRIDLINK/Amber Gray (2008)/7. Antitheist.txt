Rubbing ash into my eyes
Inside the broken halos
Expose yourself to my faith
So you can be slit open
Stark out to the horizon
Flat out
Nowhere
Coughing up asphalt
The after
Death mint burns with phosphor

Baptized in used up turpentine
Bleaching yourself with bile
The new gold standard of death
A schedule 1 narcotic
Veiled in ceremony
Driven by a good shepherd
The only things that I know
Have been fucking cut in me
A vessel for the lord, used up and thrown away
Take what you can till the lie comes to an end
Your fucking straw men burnt in place
At the crown of Everest
