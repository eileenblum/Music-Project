I come to you in pieces, with seams that no thread can mend
It feels so good to reopen these wounds again and again
Heart is racing, punctuating
Stab wounds Trojan horse
Accepted handshake doused in venom
An envoy baring fangs
Feel conditioning constrict with anger, the ground falls away, smashed apart into a slurry of noise
coated amber grey

The ideals of Hourai empty sprites shot into the glimmer screaming 
somehow you survived 
taught to be riven, and come back alive
Spirits of the dead pry themselves apart
into ashes, into gray
Nonlinear war between the lines
gore point opens the grave
Jacking static sunset calm.
Balm venom panic white, arbitrary anatomy, the packets shrapnel writes
