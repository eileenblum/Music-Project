3 miles down
Wide timed out
Ultra violet scanning
With starlight through cowled eyes
Racketing the silence
Daisy cutter follows on
Exit strategy
Cut the strings
Attached to cover
Your tracks to Kowloon and back
Self destructing simulacrum
Fill your eyes
With crash
The welling sucked back
Back inside
And fed into olne time pads
Nowhere from here
My back to the sea
Burning all my fucking bridges
