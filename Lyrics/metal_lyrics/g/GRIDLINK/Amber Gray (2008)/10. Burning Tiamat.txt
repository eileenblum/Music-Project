Burning tiamat with murderous intent
Dumping fresh picks of the day
Oil fires bleach the apron of twilight
And smear it with tritium haze
Clinically butchering test groups
From serial number one tech
Safely within the churn (rate) of collateral damage
Send the predator drones back in

Send your traffic frenzied basilisk
Retiring threats with hate and discontent
Sicking fucking topped off black sky
You're lucky if you're left strow in ashes

Glass house comes apart corona flares
Inferno was just waiting for an opening
Silmido shrugged shellacked with lime
Tiamat screaming all the fucking time
