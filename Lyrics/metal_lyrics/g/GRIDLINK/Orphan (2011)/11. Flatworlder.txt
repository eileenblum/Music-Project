The future is God's alone
Do not even look to the clouds
The right of Jihad
The prophet's murderers fetch myths
No history before God
Scabbed with Bid'ah
Students of the prophet
Anything in the name of Sharia

Guilt submission obedience
Belief explodes shrapnel inside of you
Kiteless skies are free of sin
Vampires wash the ashes down
Pawn and kings alike are burned
Their graves are then destroyed
Crowds applaud God's mercy inflicted by vermin trapped in Sharia
To them there is only ablution
To be atoned a flat world
I need to believe in your God so I know
