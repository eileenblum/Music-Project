The heart stops on a dime
Not enough room for all the sorrow
Words are not enough
But they are the limit of your charity
A shared furtive nod
Let out the line but don't cut bait
When the muzzle report catches up
Your look betrays us all

Break the suit
Dump your heart
Or take the trick
Face down

If I can't win
I'll make sure you lose
I'm the man on the grassy knoll

This is the time when you hold someone
Look at them and tell them it's alright
This is the time when you hold someone
Look at them and tell them a lie
