Kiku and embers scattered, a knife at an absent bedside
Six coins for the crossing, laid out to the West
The waters of the last moment, a name inked in red
Piper Lou offered in madness by Sheryl to the vacuum
But she's reunited with ashes and another promise dies
Like the Deloyer 7
We're offered up for terms
And Camille Vidan's parents were they casualties of war?
To steal back this last betrayal
Cashim hits the self destruct

Cemeteries walled around
(The ones) who died for your sins
Your best intentions forgot
Times out in the end
The gaze of the dead can't be taken back
They stare piercingly from heaps tied in barbed wire
