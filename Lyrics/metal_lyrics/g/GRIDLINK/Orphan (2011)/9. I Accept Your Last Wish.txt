I will never forget this last moment
Trapped by the memories of the dead
How many lives have we swept aside
Can't find the answer or just won't hear
That you want for yourself
But I only want to forget
What will it take for you to see
That your God has hung up on you

Greedy spirits flock to me
Love of the dead
Coming back into myself I can't ever let go
Are we searching or running?
THe ripe snaps tight, tangling limbs
The barb hooks back and to free myself I must kill (you)

Curtain of light spreads across the vacuum
A light that's seen from the Earth
Impatient hearts see a clean future
But only in black and white

Change the world by destroying lives, destroyed by our will to live
Lost despite following a path to the end
I accept your last wish
