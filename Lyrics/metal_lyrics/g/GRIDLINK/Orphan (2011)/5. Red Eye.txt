A kiss goodbye on the overpass
Red eye to red eye
The world overnight just ahead of tomorrow's sunrise
Concrete spires the manifold ratlines vein the web
Eyes averted running tracks
Tying up loose ends

Gate to gate, empty branches, seasons without life
Dusk cuts the horizon with amber, over the portal pull the shade
Concrete spires the manifold ratlines vein the web
Eyes averted running tracks
Tying up loose ends

City to city
Life to life
There isn't a destination anymore
Setting change out the window 
But I'm not there
