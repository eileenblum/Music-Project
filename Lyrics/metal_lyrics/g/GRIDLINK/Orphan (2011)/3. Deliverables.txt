A heart of fool's gold
The charity in your eyes is worthless
Traveling salesman come to eat my dead
Your promises cost more
Than they're worth
Your secrets I'll take them from you with haloperidol

Scorpions doused in fire ants
Stirred and painted with gasoline
Take from you until there's nothing left
Picking meat from the bone while you're still alive

No one kept you in the dark
On the ground floor from day one
Early adopter, evangelist
Did God walk out on you after gifting you cholera?
