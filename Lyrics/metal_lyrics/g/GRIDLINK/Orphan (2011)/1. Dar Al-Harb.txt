Did God whisper in your ear and pin a death note on your heart
Pious eyes painted with piety and blood
Trade stockholm syndrome confessions in weekly support groups for the dead
Tell yourself it's enough to bleed if it doesn't leave a scar

A tattoo cried out
A cringing halt
Connect people with mass graves

Draped over saddles the dead return
Parts of yourself die

Vampire slaked by the blood of the kufr
Sprung monster closet the dar al-harb
The long knives of the prophet held close at my throat
I jam the knife in through myself to get to you
