I have a dream
And this dream will stand among many others
Bring this nightmare to its knees
I like to color dreams of the world
I feel my pulse overcoming my body
Try to take this in
It wont fall
Open up my eyes and see I am (stronger than this)
Never lose sight of whats coming next
I open my eyes to see I am
Of this world to see what my dream will have
I have a dream
