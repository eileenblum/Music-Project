Words clash violence now marks the end of the world
Now marks the end of the world
Your just a dead man you mine as well be buried alive
Visions of a world once known
Epitome of his flawless creation
You're just a dead man you might as well be buried alive
We watch the world as it crumbles beneath our feet
To you there in you
You're just a dead man
We put your lives in a vault once lost
Bring in these thoughts of hope
Living here is such a hell
Come take us now
Live your life as you will
But be prepared to be charged for your actions
You better be prepared for revelations
Live your life
We watch as this world crumbles
