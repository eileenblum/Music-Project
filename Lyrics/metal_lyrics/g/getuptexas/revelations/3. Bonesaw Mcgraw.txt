When the sky's come falling down is this really who you want to be
You will never succeed with this task you've brought me
You've live a meaningless life, Bonesaw Mcgraw
You're running away from whats trapped inside yourself
You can not be this way forever I will doubt
That you will ever see deep inside yourself
To bring this monster out
Out of you bring him out of you
Out of your inner darkness
