Father oh father where were you?
When I needed you
Where were you?
You turned away from the decisions once made
Now itâs time to face the facts
Because we wonât stop
We wonât stop
We wonât stop until weâre dead
You will never be half the man
That Iâve grown to be
Youâll never see
What Iâve seen
Youâll feel the way you make me feel
This is the end of the line
This is where we part ways
So walk on water or drown
Because tonight youâre sleeping with the fishes
Maybe next time you will think before you act
Youâll never be half the man that I have grown to be
Youâll never see what Iâve seen
Youâll feel the way you make me feel
So walk on water or drown
