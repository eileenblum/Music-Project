Four and a half million years ago
The earth was lifeless and new
Life forms starting to appear
And fossils are the clues

Slowly migrating from the sea
To one day dominate the land
Early reptilians had evolved
Millions of years before man

Unchallenged masters of their world
One hundred forty million year reign
Reptilian gods stalking the earth
Undisturbed primal and serene

Mountains of flesh shaking the ground
Armored like a living tank
While our ancestors rodent-like
Trampled underfoot

Our minds can't conceive the forms of life
That have lived here before us
On the sites where our cities sprawl
Herds grazed and continued to evolve

Man's time on earth is barely a blink
Of the eye of time
Our destination is written in bones
And our predecessors fossilized

No seven day miracle created our world
From the void delivered
We have only just learned to walk
Once we had to slither

Our kind will vanish as did theirs
Leaving only traces entombed
Till those who follow unearth our remains
What will their studies conclude?

Engine of death in its highest form
Carnivore evolved to perfection
Modern predators so insignificant
Up against this tyrant king

What catastrophe fell from the skies
Ending their domination?
Wiped off the face of the earth
Not one survived extinction

Man's time on earth is barely a blink
Of the eye of time
Our destination is written in bones
And our predecessors fossilized
