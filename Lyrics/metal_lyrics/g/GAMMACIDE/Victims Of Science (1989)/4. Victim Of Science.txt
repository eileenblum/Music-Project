Minds conceive weapons to destroy
Chemical cancer created for war
Biological weapons with degenerative effects
An unfortunate fate for life it infects

Mass murder descending in sickly clouds
Victims of Science litter the ground
Stillborn mutants dying at the moment of birth
Weapons of this war poison the earth

Pacifist protest the slaughter must stop
As the environment falls apart
Chemical recall the toxic waste
Safely disposed of in a harmless place

Buried underground, dumped in the sea
Contaminate our bodies gradually
Our chromosomes filled with degradation
Passing on the curse to the next generation

Mass murder descending in sickly clouds
Victims of Science litter the ground
Stillborn mutants dying at the moment of birth
Weapons of this war poison the earth

Life as we know it will soon cease to exist
From this chemical poisoning
We've no cure for it
Nothing shall survive nuclear holocaust
Mankind is doomed
And all life is lost
