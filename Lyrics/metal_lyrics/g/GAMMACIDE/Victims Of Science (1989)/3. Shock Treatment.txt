Psychosis
Pathologically driven to homicide
Perception torn apart

Confined to his padded cell
Foaming at the mouth
In his private hell

Frozen minds, wretched lives
Lightning strikes and they're neutralized
Therapy of misery
Electrical lobotomy

Electrodes wired to the brain
A jolt of reality
For the insane

Power surge, sensory overload
Strapped tightly down
Until convulsions cease

Frozen minds, wretched lives
Lightning strikes and they're neutralized
Therapy of misery
Electrical lobotomy

Wheeled into the room where you'll be from now on
Strait-jacket unnecessary your resistance is gone
Vegetable in the corner staring into space
You're easier to deal with in a catatonic state

Give me shock treatment!
