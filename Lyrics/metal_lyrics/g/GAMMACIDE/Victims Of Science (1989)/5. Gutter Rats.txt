No one knows what goes on beneath our feet
An evil swarm has gathered below the street
Driven to a frenzy by atomic breath
Matted fur and fangs, swarming death
Ancient instinct gives the long awaited command
Day of retribution is now at hand
Gutter rats armed with claws of steel
The need to kill is all they feel

Lunging and plunging their fangs
Deep in the veins of the old
Mocking the laws of science
That we have been told
Killing and spilling our blood
Until the first red dawn
Lusting and trusting the feeling
That drives them on

Swarms fill the streets and the gutters run red
Rats infest piles of the dead
Nature's revenge against the human race
Lunging rabid for your fucking face
