Unsolved rapes in your neighborhood
Hitting close to home

Your friends molested by an unseen thing
That strikes them when alone

Walking home you feel the gaze
Of malevolent eyes
Filled with terror your are nevertheless
Wet between the thighs

Pray for mercy 
Pray for death
Pray you're spared the clawed caress
The hatred that dwells in all of us
Manifest the Incubus

Night falls
I enter your room with a serpent's hiss
Red eyes piercing the black
Moonlight illuminates your naked body
Lying on your back
Spread your legs and usher me in
I've yet to be turned down
Your body licked by the flames of the pit as I begin to pound

Pray for mercy 
Pray for death
Pray you're spared the clawed caress
The hatred that dwells in all of us
Manifest the Incubus

My source is ancient evil deeds
Their memory keeps me alive
Personification of human cruelty
In dreams I materialize

Blood engorged evil swollen with hate
You cannot take it all
Scream in pain until I'm done
No one shall hear your call
My desire satisfied I leave you now
Sprawled on blood stained sheets
Down the hall to your mother's room
Where she soundly sleeps

Pray for mercy 
Pray for death
Pray you're spared the clawed caress
The hatred that dwells in all of us
Manifest the Incubus
