Aerosol damaged ozone layer
Skin cancer cases increase
Human shit, A.I.D.S. tainted blood
Washed up on the beach
Drano snorting, your face contorting
Force your body to accept more
Sweating in the blood bank, selling a pint
Back to the crack house to score.

Observe, and tell me what you see
Turn your back, blind to reality
Society condemns its own fate
Wake up before it's too fucking late

Radon gas entering your home
Silent invisible death
Pesticides in your lunch
Nicotine on your breath
Preschool junkie raped by her father
By day he's the mayor of your city
A community full of back stabbing scum
No friends, no love, no pity

Observe, and tell me what you see
Turn your back, blind to reality
Society condemns its own fate
Wake up before it's too fucking late

Observe, and tell me what you see
Turn your back, blind to reality
Society condemns its own fate
Wake up before it's too fucking late
