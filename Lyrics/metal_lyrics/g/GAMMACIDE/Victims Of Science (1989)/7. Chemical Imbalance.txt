Autonomic reactions maintaining life
Not conscious to what is going on
A stable internal environment is what is needed
To maintain your life form
Sickness sets in to hinder and destroy
Your central nervous system
Impaired brain and spine just a matter of time
Delusions entering your mind

Fluids are surging inside your vein
Intensity of pain inside your brain
Chemical Imbalance

Suddenly a stranger to those I know
As the madness within me continues to grow
DNA dysfunction screaming in pain
A part of me that cant be changed
Abnormal brain the symptoms get worse
Multiple disorders subsequently the curse
Disorder derangement of neurological function
Psychoactive drugs have little effect
Injections of lithium ease mental pain
Just an illusion still quite insane
Chemical imbalance

[Lead: Scott]

Addicted to drugs that give me sanity
Warped visions of your reality
See the maggots crawling on my flesh
Devouring me

Plagued by oppressors only I can see
That doesn't lessen their death threat to me
They'll know I was right when they find my corpse
Mutilated

[Lead: Rick]

The presence of toxins sets in motion
A vicious chemical cycle
Suddenly a stranger to those that I know
As the madness within me continues to grow
DNA dysfunction screaming in pain
A part of me that cant be changed
Abnormal brain the symptoms get worse
Multiple disorders subsequently the curse

Injections of lithium ease mental pain
Just an illusion still quite insane
Chemical Imbalance
