Polluted and black with rotten decay
The bitch wears a virgin's mask
Unending lust for a power thrust
Has made her a walking plague

She enters your life for just one night
She's gone before the morning light
She's left behind a little surprise
That lingers though she's gone

No longer human, a walking plague
No longer human, she's a walking plague

Incubating deep inside
The virus spreads corruption
Unaware you carry the seed
Of your own destruction

No longer human, a walking plague
No longer human, she's a walking plague

Breaking down all defenses
Immunities as one
Discharge dripping from your dick
Infection has begun

Sex-spawned death destroys your body
The end draws closer each day
The only cure for this nightmare
Disease is still several years away

Unjustly condemned you take your revenge
Against the female race
By infecting every one that you can
And laughing in their face

No longer human, a walking plague
No longer human, you're the walking plague
