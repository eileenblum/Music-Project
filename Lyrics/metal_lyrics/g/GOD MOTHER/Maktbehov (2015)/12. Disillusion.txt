Twenty-four hours of feeding the brain
With total bullshit just trying to drain
The public from thinking on its own
While the leaders idly sit on their throne
Democracy, freedom and peace
Just an illusion they are trying to sell
We are the ones harassed by police
The ones living the hell
No real choices
Only predetermined death
Nothing gained
Just one day shorter of breath
Oppression will come to an end
We will rise from the ashes
Rebuild what you have done
The revolution has only begun
The days are numbered
Your ways are doomed
Forever buried your ideas entombed
We will not be silenced
We will not give in
After all the blood we have bled
In the end we will win
No more pain
No more lies
It was all in vain
It is time for demise
