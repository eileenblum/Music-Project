Fighting for the next kick
Fighting for those who are making the rules
Those afraid of change get used as tools
Meaningless killings for a meaningless war
This war must end and the prohibition laws
The system has failed
It is time for a change
Stop all this madness
It is all deranged
Struggling for a fix quick
Twenty-five years for a pocket of ace
No wonder the prisons run out of space
Meaningless killings for a meaningless cause
This war must end with the prohibition laws.
Look around you, what do you see?
This system does not seem right to me
People dying in vain everyday
No vision forward
Just a replay
Why can't we see the way out of this same decay?
No way out
