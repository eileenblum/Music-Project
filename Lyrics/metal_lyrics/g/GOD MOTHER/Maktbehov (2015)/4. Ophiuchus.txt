Split tongue black lung
Two-faced faked grace
Venom welcomed
Gold scaled bloody nails
No hope. No love.
Eyes bleached trust leeched
Rough hands commands
No love. No light.
No light. No heart.
Raise them condemned
No view left through
No heart. No hope.
Love has grown for those side-winding for control
Vices
Blood and tears turned to fat.
Growing thick
Vices
You have been giving us sweet lies
We accepted in our dimmed eyes
Now we face a hunger that is without an end
Slowly creep you rattle forward
Shed your skin, eat the weak.
Let your color run onward
Shed your skin, eat the weak.
Love has grown
This we applaud
Us pleading to a fraud
Now we have grown a hunger that is without an end
Slowly creep
Control
Why do we heed by snakes teach?
How can we love when snakes preach?
