Living way over your assets
Spending money on meaningless things
Trying to hide your true self
Happiness money can buy
What have become of your life?
Nothing else left to enjoy
You need to have it all
To cope with your meaningless life
No plan or even a clue what it is all about
Your life is passing by your eyes
Wasting time, but there is no doubt
That everything living finally dies
Your existence a waste of life
Your presence a plague
Break free from the chains of lies
Nothing left for you
Break free from the chains of life
Nothing left to do
You did not care to listen
Or even give a thought
That your own freedom is already bought
Wasting time but there is no doubt
That everything living finally dies
Your possessions made you blind to see
The true tokens of reality
Break free from the chains of lies
Nothing left for you
Break free from the chains of life
Nothing left for you
