Beloved precious rites
Sacred cherished lie
To be saved of guilt from something greater
Can one believe this is still believed in?
Baptized, burn the blood
Turn and veil the sanctum in sinful flood
Tunnel circled thought
Desire choked in knots
To be saved of guilt from something greater
Can one believe this is still believed in?
When all your hope was abandoned
This was the path that you abide
Confess
Accomplished only in your own mind
You are full of fire burned out and blind
Faith has turned into your swords
To prove true a book of myth and words
Liar. Traitor. Killer.
You have earned your name
Death cheater
Chaos justified, to paradise
What is a life but a sacrifice?
Of all in us we bless
None will be holy.
