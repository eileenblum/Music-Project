Rest in the ignorance
Feel it at the back of your teeth
The palate of blood thirst
Skin against grinded fangs
The clash of bone and sinew
Preying upon weakness
Progress through the strength of your bite
Wolf jaw
Accepting preconceptions
Accepting preconception
The vice was your own desire
Promised and believed to be fulfilled
Projected and teached solemn worship
Insecurity formed the path
The road is run
Carved deep
Locked in abyss
No ability to look back
In a false sense of loyalty
These eyes fixed and vacant
Desperately seeking meaning
Varggom
Bleed the beast
Skin against teeth
Varggom.
