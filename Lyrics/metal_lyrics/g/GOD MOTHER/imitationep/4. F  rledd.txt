HjÃ¤rntvÃ¤ttad Ã¥t till den milda grad
Du inte fÃ¶rstÃ¥r vad du gÃ¶r
Du lever i blindo av ljuset
Du varken ser eller hÃ¶r.
Ni Ã¤r lurade
In i tron
Ni Ã¤r lurade
Maktens lakejer har brÃ¤nt eran bro.
Ni Ã¤r lurade
In i tron
Ni Ã¤r lurade
?????
Hur lÃ¤nge ska vi blunda
FÃ¶r att offren dom blir fler och fler.
Ni Ã¤r lurade
In i tron
Ni Ã¤r lurade
Maktens lakejer har brÃ¤nt eran bro.
Ni Ã¤r lurade
In i tron
Ni Ã¤r lurade
??????.

[English translation:]

[Beguiled]

Brainwashed into the mild degree
You don't comprehend what you do
You live blinded by the light
You can neither see nor hear
You are deceived
Into belief
You are deceived
The lackeys of power have burned your bridges
You are deceived
Into belief
You are deceived
?????
For how long will we shut our eyes
The victims become more and more
You are deceived
Into belief
You are deceived
The lackeys of power have burned your bridges
You are deceived
Into belief
You are deceived
??????.
