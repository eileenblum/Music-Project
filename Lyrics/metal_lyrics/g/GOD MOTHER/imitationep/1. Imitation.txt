It is an imitation
It is your limitation
Your false life unfolds
With all that it holds.
Afraid what life might bring
Not knowing what to do
You do not do anything
You will become a mindless tool.
Living in your square
Never cared to look around
Your life is not here
Nowhere to be found
You can't live when your dead
But you can't stay alive
It is all in your head:
You can't live until you die.
It is an imitation
It is your limitation
Your false life unfolds with all that it holds.
