Why can't we see what we are about to be
Nothing left after you and me
Scavenging. Marauding. Exploiting everything.
Leave nothing behind.
Destroy and do not build up what you have done
Taking advantage of the poor
Nothing is more important than your own prosperity.
How can you be so blind
We are running out of time
It's getting closer to the point of no return.
How could we ever lived with the guilt of knowing what is to come
But done nothing for the better
No future anymore
No future.
