Ingen sjÃ¤lvinsikt
En sjuk arrogans
Kritisera allting
Helt utan substans
Det man inte fÃ¶rstÃ¥r
Det mÃ¥ste vara fel
Men du fattar ingenting.
Vad du gÃ¶r Ã¤r att du lÃ¥ter ditt hat bÃ¶rja dÃ¤r din fÃ¶rdom slutar.
I vÃ¤ntan pÃ¥ Ã¤ndring har du blivit vad du fÃ¶rtjÃ¤nar.
Du predikar hÃ¶gt men du sÃ¤ger ingenting
Det finns inga budskap kvar att sÃ¤lja
Ignorans talar fÃ¶r dig.

[English translation:]

[Ignorance Speaks]

No self-insight
A sick arrogance
Criticize everything without substance
What you don't understand
It has to be wrong
But you don't get it.
What you do is that you let your hate begin where your prejudice ends.
By waiting for change you've turned into what you deserve.
You preach loud but you don't say anything
There are no messages left to sell
Ignorance speaks for you.
