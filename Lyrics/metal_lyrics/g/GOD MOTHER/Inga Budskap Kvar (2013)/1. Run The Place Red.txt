Silence has become a stone in my mouth
My fingers are worked down to the bone
You have led our eyes into smoke and mirrors
And I turn sick to the back of my teeth.
We carry burdens on our broken backs
Following blind until we collapse
All your tomorrows ends today
Lie to yourself just to stay sane.
Run the place red
Burn it all down
Run the place red
Burn it all down
Your tomorrow ends today.
