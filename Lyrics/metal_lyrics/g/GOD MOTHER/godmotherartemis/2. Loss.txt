Thrown roses have all fallen
The roots lay withered bare
And for truth no longer spoken
We hunger
We dropped the swords and torches
Blindfolded by victory
Now like lions without teeth
We hunger
Disappointment overwhelms
Dissatisfaction towering
Memory runs on roads without journey
In the fear to lose it all
We hunger
The noise and feedback
All complete and sweet
In this world entire
We hunger
Disappointment overwhelms
Dissatisfaction lets go with rope in hand
Death of the self
We can't escape ourselves but
Change is a chariot constantly stampeding on
With or without you
In our fear of loss
Makes life already gone
In our fear of loss
Makes this world already lost
Change
Is a chariot constantly stampeding on
With or without you
Chariot
Riding on
Fear erodes your soul
