Baptised in flames
A life of escape
No gift in this curse
Numbing the shame
Along shame
Choke regret
Snakes manifest
From the pride, a swollen stomach
The bones now lay bare
Life in defeat
A vicious cycle of longing
Come violent winds
Come long knives
For my pride a swollen stomach
The cycles
Lost in voids between voids
Between the cage and the vision
Break yourself free
Bones bare longing for closure
Downward spiral
There is no beginning
No end
