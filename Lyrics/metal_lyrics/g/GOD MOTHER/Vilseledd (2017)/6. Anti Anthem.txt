Perverted statist perfection
Clenched fists inside of gloves
Your mouths are full of hate
But no matter the words
It all meant the same
You drive us
To hate
To bleed
Fighting for invisible lines
Eating up visible lies
Blindly follow stated divisions
You define yourself by pride in a nation
To hate
To bleed
You pigs
Fuck your flag
