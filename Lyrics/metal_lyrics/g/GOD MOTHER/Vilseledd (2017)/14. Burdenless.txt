Waking up to pointless ends
Turning this tide to what is inside
Ship is sinking into outer nets
Water runs pitch black
How I pity these wretches walking this earth
Veins filled with delusion and hope
With burdenless shoulders
Diamonds are nothing but a lump of coal
Stagnated regret
Chaos in sight, deter
Copacetic outside
Riding without a goal to end
Stretched out of sight
Tied to the ride down to the depths
Incessant strength
How I pity these wretches walking this earth
Veins filled with delusion and hope
With burdenless shoulders
Diamonds are nothing but a lump of coal
So I dig down
Aversion into desire
A falling sky
Hide underground
