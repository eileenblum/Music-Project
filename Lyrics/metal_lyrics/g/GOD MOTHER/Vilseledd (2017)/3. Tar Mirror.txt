A smeared out dirt reflection
Of this world purged by flames
In dreary light we crawl
The stars go over as a rain of arrows
Cup the poison to the lips of hope

Our eyes are blackened in and burnt, abluted out
Stripped from our names, stuck in a void, caged us in by doubt
The whole world burning
Grey future purged
Remnants of hearts beats hollow
Dogs. Screaming for revolution
Along the coast and ridges, send execution
The whole world burning
A holy crux
We all need something to believe in
This is why you lie to yourself
Coal covered eyes open up to see
The charred remains of what we will never be
