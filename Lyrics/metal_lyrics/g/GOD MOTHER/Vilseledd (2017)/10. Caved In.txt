Caught in a trap with no way out
A prisoner of your own mind
No idea what it's about
Your actions left you blind
Looking for something that cannot be found
Stumbling in the dark
Easy answers and burdensome choices
Never left it's mark
Apprehension
Your own dissension
Feed me lies
Recognize
Forced into a contrived reality, false and unreal
Trapped in your own horrid ideal
Die
Laid to rest in death
