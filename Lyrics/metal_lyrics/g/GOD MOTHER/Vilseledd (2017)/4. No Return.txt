I feel it creeping in
The fence is falling
Lingering, on my skin
It keeps me locked up here
I can't move, I'm going nowhere
Stuck in between thoughts of life
That separates my truth from lies
I never thought that I would see
Just how indifferent you would be
You keep me locked up here
You tie me up, I'm going nowhere (Separation)
Transparent darkness
Leads the way
Breaking in and out of myself
Destruction is a locked door
I will not return
I will watch you burn
