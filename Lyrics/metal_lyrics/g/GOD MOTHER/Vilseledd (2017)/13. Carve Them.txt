Violent streams caress the dark ocean room that holds me
Where sunken cities lie hidden from this world
The falling wave
Mountains are shattered by the force of tides
A loss of light
Holes in the sky by the stars aligned
Carving out gills
Shifting my shape for in his name
The maelstrom forms
Eternal sleep that death cannot touch
Petals throb mud
Skin catches dew
Covered in salt
Waking ashore on the naked surface
Covered in blood
Vibrant and rhythmic, the stars explode
Bodies throb mud
Skin catches dew
The ocean beckons for me
I'll swim from guilt forever
Let go of fear together
Disappear beneath the surface and forget the open air
I'll swim with the deep ones
