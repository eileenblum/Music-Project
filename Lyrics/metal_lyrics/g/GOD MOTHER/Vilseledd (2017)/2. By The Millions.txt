We are afraid
Scared of a changing homeland
That led and still leads to every white hood and red armband that is put on
There are guns in the hands of men on the streets.
When they come for yours, this put them there
It is fear
This is fear
Of warring ideals
Bloody upheaval
Friends to give up on friends, neighbours give in their neighbours
This is fear
This is fear
"Do it to Julia," by the millions
This is fear and I am afraid of it
