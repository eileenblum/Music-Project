Swivel-eyed lunacy wrapped in stars and stripes
A beauty pageant for xenophobia
Inventing lies affirmed by yourself
Beat your chest, bellow righteous fury
You will make it all great again
Brave intolerance
Bravely stripping control.
You spray your cash around
And hiss your promise
"Freedom for all."
We are free to be dead
You are a holocaust in a limousine, (you are) privilege running riot
Being the acrid salt into the very wounds of the world your teeth ate through
Hate eats itself
