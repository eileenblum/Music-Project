Wrapped yourself in medals and regalia you have not earned
In the name of the people you do not even represent
Closed eyes glimmer
A nations nostalgia
You suffer in patriotic myth
The blood, the vomit, the toil and the tears
The confused panic
Instead of answering
You are nothing but a charlatan
With claws, with your toothless mouth
You suck out your own blood and replace it with bile
A force with no face, a system without centre
Written in blood and the people they cheer
You could see it all so clear and true
If you would just open up your porcine eyes and fucking look
You suck out your own blood and replace it with bile
