Hands are stripped from all of your own strength
An arid sense
Calmness is a wasted breath
Unnerving confusion
The first steps taken in your mind (This light)
Hard to express, hard to shine
Helplessly trapped
(Yeah)
A forest fire
Burning inside out
Wicked maelstrom
This is the absorption of all light (Caved in)
To forget beside this axe, lies my head
Accept yourself. As the enemy
Crush me, warp it out
Cacophony
