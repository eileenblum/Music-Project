You feel they are so distance
When you need new blood pour into your veins
Drained and lost in dark nightmares
When you're feeling down

Look all around of you and me
You can hear their smiles; you feel their sighs
They will clean their souls in the church
Their faith will absorb all their lies

We live in dark times... The money change the thoughts...
In your world... of oblivion...
But I still remember... what's the truth...
Everything burns in the fire... I closed your book... 

[Chorus:]
I'm standing here in silence as a knell of your souls in the night
Strong One against all your intolerable storms
Once you will need the help, you will be lost in broken hopes
No one will hear by my side
So I will close your book

We live in dark times... The money change the thoughts...
In your world... of oblivion...
But I still remember... what's the truth...
Everything burns in the fire... I closed your book... 

[Chorus]

You see they are so beauty
When is after all and they're so kind
But under the mask of the angel
Sleeps the rotting christ

Look all around of you and me
You can hear their smiles; you feel their sighs
They will clean their souls in the church
Their faith will absorb all their lies
