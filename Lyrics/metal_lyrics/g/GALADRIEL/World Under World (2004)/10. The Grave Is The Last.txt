[Chorus:]
They appointed their words for the truth
Which everyone must to take for own
When (the) mind (will) rise against their arogance
Then (the) body will leave (the) world in the flames

I hail you all down there
In the cradle of your own dreams
Of innocence and ignorance
Lost in lies of your dark sins

I spread my wings of pain and try
To clear your minds by the tears of yours
Give your life some drop of meaning
And prepare you for your doom

You're mortal, nothing more
And nothing more will waiting for you
Heart is your heart and the brain is your brain
Forget your soul...

I hail you all... by the gate of death
When you lie under cold stones
Failured and surprised ?
All your hopes fell down into the dust

[Chorus:]
Fettered in chains you're scrolling through your lives
And waiting for the promised delivering ... after that all ...
Hopeless you refused all what life brought to you
But time goes by and you will know the truth ... when it will rise ...

[Chorus:]
You are too much poor to leave their power
The roots of their blooming trees are rotten inside
And the springs of their brooks are poisoned thorough
Few of men can resist, few of you'll be free

Fattered in chains you see only your (their) line
It's not allowed to look all around
And know, what's suitable for every of you
This evil is rooted deep down in the graves of your fathers

No savior, no god
And your mind is filling with emptiness
You will know the truth for a moment
... and the feeling of helpless... inside...
