Alone with my mind I live for
This evening of my thoughts and my feelings
Alone in this night I live for
The lights of candles and flowers on your stone
Alone with my tears I die for
Your beatless heart and memories lost in dark
And my wind is blow for
Your dust and my mind is filling with the night and pain

All those years I have to cry for
Few letters engraved on your black epitaph
And I still feel my heart beats with yours
Despite of time - it cannot turning back
And I live my life of my own ways
I think of you, you'll be my eternal flame

[Chorus:]
You are down there, hear my bleeding heart's poetry
Under cold stone you're lying in (the) sea of my tears
Thorns, sadness and pain, my mind is full of insanity
Dying leaves are falling with rain to oblivion

In the greyland, full of shadows
I'm leaving my souls of immortals again

Alone with my mind I live for
This evening of my thoughts and my feelings
All those years I have to cry for
Few letters engraved on your black epitaph
Alone in this night I live for
The lights of candles and flowers on your grave
I still feel my heart beats with yours
Despite of time - it cannot turning back

[Chorus]
