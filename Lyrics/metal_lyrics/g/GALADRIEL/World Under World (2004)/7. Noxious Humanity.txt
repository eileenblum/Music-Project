[Chorus:]
All of your Lucifers are rising now
Still you can pray, but this was your own goal
Sickness you've looking for in the other ones
You found out in your own souls and rotten minds

We have never enlighten from our own mistakes of the past
Our characteristic of self-destruction no one rooted out

The fallen angels are flying all over the sky 
And infatuated ones will look into (the) mirror of the truth
It will bring the end of all your absurd faiths and dreams
And the end of the world will come true

Look all around of you; we're living like a cancer of the Earth
We cannot follow this direction. It will be our doom

[Chorus]

"The fire burns all around me over the land
And my visions comes true -
I'm standing in the circle - 
All burns with me and with my Earth
I know it will bring the pain for you"

We have never enlighten from our own mistakes of the past
Look all around of you; we're living like a cancer of the Earth

How many times the finger of the fate admonished us
There's so many of our kind and it's the germ of end
Look all around you; how you can be so blind?
We threw this world in fire and burned all bridges back

[Chorus:] ...
