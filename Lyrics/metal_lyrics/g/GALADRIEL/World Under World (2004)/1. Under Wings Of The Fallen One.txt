There's the mysterious frost of the darkest night
Penetrating into your bones, so beauty, so strong

And cold moon will disclose his vicious pale face
And will show me way, which I will set out
I can feel my feelings. I remember my name
And I know the answers for the questions of my fate

The innocent creature wakes up in the silence
Who will influence his life and his mind?
Will be allowed to him to choose the own direction?
Let him march under the wings of Belial

[Chorus:]
Feel My Lonely, feel my silent cryin;
Dream my dreams deep in the night
See my sorrow, see my silent dying
With my thousand years old sigh
Find the reason, find the meaning of my
Life among two worlds and times
I will turning the light on of my passion
Under wings of the fallen one

Open your eyes to look around. You men of rotten minds
And see, you millions of seduced to wrong way of your gods

Here I come to talk about the doubts of your faiths
To all of you, which worship the kings of slaves

As you are scrolling through (the) life of your own
You will found out the evil and good
And when the sun is going down and universe (will) absorb you
In the night you will know, how great is to be free

[Chorus:]
Feel My Lonely, feel my silent crying
Dream my dreams deep in the night
See my sorrow, see my silent dying
With my thousand years old sigh
Find the reason, find the meaning of my
Life among two worlds and times
I will turning the light on of my passion
Under wings of the fallen one

I will keep my mind full of my freedom and bleeding
Look through my eyes to the world of my pain
(I'm) scrolling tired but still strong enough against your storms
(I'm) burning all bridges back to my own flame

Incline you heads, you mass of blinded ignorance
Because I am the highest embodiness of man's life

As you are scrolling through (the) life of your own
You will found out the evil and good
And when the sun is going down and universe (will) absorb you
In the night you will know, how great is to be free
