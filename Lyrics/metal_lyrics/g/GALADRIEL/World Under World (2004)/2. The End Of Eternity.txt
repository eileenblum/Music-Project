In the name of God you chosed the night
Did you really thought you'll be delivered ?
Do you fear you will not see the light ?
I know it's the end of your clear mind

You see my daemons flies over skies
And death is comming to be your bride
There is no helping hand of jusus christ
And all your hopes are broken down (and down)

They told you stories about eternal life
Somewhere in heaven and down in your hell
So look around you and see the real presence
There's only destroyed Earth and sickness and pain

I see many insane ones drowned in lake
I see many ones destroy the signs of their souls...
They're all damned... only strong ones will survive...
They're all down and poor - The truth is known...

You lived your lives in the name of nothing.
Be prepeared, you'll be not understood...

[Chorus:]
Let me introduce you the truth of this world
Let me impart you there's liberty of thoughts
And your dark satan was the same as your god
And I see you hopeless, but this is the night

The truth is known for all who survived
But there's Shakespeare's question (so much) actual
"To be or not to be" sounds words in your minds
Not prepeared to face new world without their god

You see my daemons flies over skies
And death is comming to be your bride
There is no helping hand of jusus christ
And all your hopes are broken down and down
