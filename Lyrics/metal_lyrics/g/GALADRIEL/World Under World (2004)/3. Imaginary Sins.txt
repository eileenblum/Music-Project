[Chorus:]
Innosence is burning in the flames of dark dreams
Your naked body is leaving (the) clear thinks
Of self-control and like a Naamah you're devoting
To the Lucifer's dance And you're fall
Asleep drowned in the lake of your extasy
When your body exploded inside... for your dreams

Silence is falling down at your tired lips
And moonlight brings the cold to your skin
I came from the darkness to fill all your dreams
Under (the) wings of night to forlive your sins

[Chorus]

Imagines of your breath filled (up) my mind
I need to feel your sighs near my eyes
Your burning rain runs through all my vains
When we're flying away (into) tender pain

For your desire's breath
I will burn down in your hell
In the silent cryings, in the silent feelings of me
I will be lost in eternal webs of your beauty
I came from the darknes
to fill all your dreams tonight
Under (the) wings of night to forlive your sins
