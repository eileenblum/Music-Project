Through the haze of the ancient time
I can see the looks of my ancestors
There's love for freedom in their eyes

The tears of women covered battlefields
Embraced the LAND with sadness
I can hear their sighs from that deep silence

There flew out the first spear from their hands
To the hearts of foes
There sounded glory screams from their mouths

Blows of shields, the screams of victory
And mother Earth adopted her own sons
In her inside, she embraced their bodies

When the sighs were over
At the battlefield, comes to a stand
Men covered by blood, sons of the Earth
With blazing shields and trembling lips, they were saluting sunrise...
Days of freedom...
