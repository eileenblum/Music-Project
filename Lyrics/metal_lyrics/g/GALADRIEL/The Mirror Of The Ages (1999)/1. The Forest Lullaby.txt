The forest is within me and I am in
I'm the birds' singing above my head
And the wind what sleeps
In crowns of trees

I've noticed her strange dance of a nakedness
Just green ornaments
Ornaments on her face
Twinkling in the glare of a blaze

"The nature adducted me in her lab, I'm her daughter
Singing of the birds is my lullaby
The rustling leaves of the trees, it's my heartbeat"

I lie down face to the Earth
I blur it on my body
Just a dense rain drums against
My skin in the rhythm of primeval

I've seen that rituals
My desires to touch her
That nature in a human shape
But she disappeared in the depth of the forest
