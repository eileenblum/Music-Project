I'm flying through the dark meadow
Among ancient feeling of my love
I'm looking for roots of my flower
I feel its odour near the wood

The moon's hovering over level of the lake
Silver light caressing the deep of the night
Majesty motions of his wings in magic colors
Tender kisses in the night

Dancing in the wind of your desire
Where naked bodies are burning in the flames
Your touch, I feel at my shade
Dark meadow's blooming to the grace

The moon's hovering...
Dancing in the wind...

Under the rain, under full moon
For our night I fall
