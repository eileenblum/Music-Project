By full moon, in the darkest hours
In my heart, in my house of power
I can feel desire of your shade

Mystic haze's falling down on me
In the circle of the forest trees
If I want to live, I need your blood

Through an ancient land
I'm wondering to you
With wind in my hair
I'm wondering to my love

For a moment, I have seen your face
In my mind, I remember that naked body
It was bleeding out of wounds

I drunk warm blood from her veins
She was my cure for all my pain
With her love, I can now LIVE!

We drunk the blood, each other
I felt the change in my heart
We were like wolves, wolves in the hunt

Then I embraced her
And veiled to my cloak
When the moon set down
We had to disappear... disappear!!!
