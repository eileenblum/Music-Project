There was just enough your words
About your senseless truth
You've adapted it to your convenience
There's blood on lips of your faith

I will forever stand against your reign
Obtained with blood of the innocent ones

Here comes your twilight time
You've to fear it for all years
Decline your god in blind minds
You have lie them with false tears

Blood... in the Mirror of Ages
Pain... in the Mirror of Ages

I will forever stand against your reign
Obtained with blood of the innocent ones
Against hypocrisy of your own words
Against your dishonour of women

Under the sign of the Nature
I will root out your seed
Of eternal lies of your words
Standing on frail rudiments

Here comes your Twilight time...
