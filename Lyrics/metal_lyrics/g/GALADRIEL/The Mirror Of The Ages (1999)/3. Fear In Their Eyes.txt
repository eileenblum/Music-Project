What for a fear in their eyes I see
When they stand alone, lonely before the gate of the death

What they fear, What for they cry
Who prisoned their souls, who kills them... eternal night!

How many venoms already ran through their veins
How long time they had trashed their souls

Their minds were obscured to bury the truth
They fear for blood that flows down people's hands

I can hear that screams, can feel that pain
Penetrating deep to my head
I grovel at the ground, feel the cold sweat
That is the LAST!!!

White walls of my room are hunting me
That long fall will be myself's victory

What for a fear in their eyes I see
When they stand alone, lonely before the gate

Their minds were obscured to bury the truth
They fear for blood that flows down people's hands
