Silence and screams are calling me to you again
But no helps so strong to deliver you my friend

I fear your fear, I fear all your weakness
You fade away like light of the stars now

Madness and greed, that painful death you chosen for life
You try to live in dreams, to leave reality behind

Each time - the same, you loose your fight with pain
There's always your face I see in my nightmares

I talk, I scream, obey leave you way now
I fear your fear, obey leave your way now....
