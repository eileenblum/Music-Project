Find the way in my empty mind
Empty labyrinths of my thoughts
Try to find continuity
Between existence and our fall...alone

Terrible visions of the truth
When I leave alone dying soul
When I'm lost in dark empire
There's no helping hand for my hopes

In this corruption I can't burn my bridges
Sentiments will stay here, they'll restore the sense'

Sun is shining bright, but I cannot see
Deep solitude, sad thoughts are free
Locked gate of life, keys are lost in sea
Bell are calling me, but there is no beat
All my memories are escape to the lost
I lost my dreams in invisible pain

Find the way in my empty mind
In my labyrinths of my thoughts
When I'm lost in my solitude
Between existence and dead hopes...alone
