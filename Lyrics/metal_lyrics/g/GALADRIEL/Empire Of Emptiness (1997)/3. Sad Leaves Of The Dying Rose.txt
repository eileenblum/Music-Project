Dev from my eyes, from sadness of my soul
It's falling down at your brittle woundy lips
Your tender thorns will never more hurt my vains...by love
Moon of this nights, his voice is still whispering

I will burn your soul, I will drink your blood
Somewhere you'll be burn again
Sad leaves of my rose...

I stand alone by the grave - gate to unknown
My bleeding heart went away with you
I want to feel touch of your tremble lips
I want to see bloom your naked leaves, but you've... fall asleep

I will burn your soul, I will drink your blood
Somewhere you'll be burn again
Sad leaves of my rose...

You still sleep...
Fall asleep...

I will burn your soul, I will drink your blood
Somewhere you'll be burn again
Sad leaves of my rose...
