We are standing here together, hand in hand we're looking at sunset
We are so stronger, when we're dreaming under moonlight night
Through the land of sunshine flying in the days of raining pain
The touch of your hand I can feel like kiss of butterfly

We can hear that deep in silence, horizon has faced the twilight sky
Under the desire, we'll be dreaming under breeze of night
We don't care what's happen, we just can remember our name
The sun started the morning, dreaming memories flies away

Take my hand and we will return to that land
And then I'll see the beauty of your face

Every night I see that land somewhere in the past of me
That's my secret hiding place before this reality

Morning comes and clouds are heavy
Raining drops are flowing down my face
I can't find back the way to my dreaming memories
