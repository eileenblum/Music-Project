I'm the statue, cold and dead as stone
I'm the darkness, a hidden fear in (the) middle of your heart

I'm the silence, the deep of the night
I'm the beauty, the dreams of love and (the) hate of your life

I'm the everything...
I'm the light at end of your lives
I'm the fate and I'm the time
I'm the feelings of your desires
I'm your helplessness in delight
I'm temptation in the darkness of (the) night
I'm your new age messiah
I'm the eyes of your dying god
I'm the revenge in me !!!

I'm your mother, I'm your daughter, blinded eyes by colors
of (the) darkest lights of me, I'm the fire, I am the wind
I'm the water, the rain that's falling down at your lips
I'm the sorrow and flowing tears and I'm all (the) pain you feel
