Awake from tears of your silent eyes
Awake from sins and burn down my life
Awake as a lover from ashes and dust
Awake and taste the night and my sighs

You are the fairy of woods and forlorn souls
I want to satisfy my lips by your blood
Like thousand arctic crystals I see your pale face
Resign your body into my bloody arms... tonight...

I wake from nowhere, from the ashes and the dust
I wake from spaces, from nascent screaming night
Like a freezing passion burns your look in silence
Your real body is just land of darkness

Awake from dark naked in the night
Awake as phoenix with blood deep inside
