Bleeding wounds inside my heart
Nothing to see through my tears
Everything ends by the grave
None of you know what I feel
I'm following the rain
As I'm falling to the ground...

What does my grief mean to them?
What (that) united pain in my heart?
It's just beginning of my death
This is just my awful born!
My soul is lost somewhere...

Like I was lying on a broken glass
Stumbling over roots of your villainies
Fading into the shadows
Keep those thorns for your own hopes... (lies)
