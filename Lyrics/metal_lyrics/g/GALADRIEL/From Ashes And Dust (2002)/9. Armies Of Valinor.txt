[tribute to the Blind Guardian]

Into the battle we ride again
Against the dark one, against the terror, suffering and pain
We're the Valar, Lords of the West
The light of trees still shines in our eyes from the past

Across the sea, into the north
There dwells the evil, the enemy we must fought
The elves cursed his name for all the time
Now he will feel the anger of those, who remained divine

Armies of evil, orcs and dark men
Scattered away as their fortress fell
Whirlpool of battle changed Middle Earth
To still remind the victory of Valinor
