Find an escape from this terrible condition
Burning memories rule my mind
I feel down, repulsive chaos is in my dreams
Living agony as your face withered

Withstand this unjust world
Nameless, hopeless - lost in sorrow
In remembrance of your leaving me
Embraced by your death

Tormented soul by visions of morning light
Spending the night with open eyes
I'm still alive, it's a neverending despair
I'm the ruin... eternally...

Now you're lying in the silence
(You're) leaving the pain at the wings of eternity
It's the end of your existence
Slowly... come slowly to me... now... !!!

Find an escape from this terrible condition
Burning memories rule my mind
I feel down, repulsive chaos is in my dreams
Living agony as your face withered
