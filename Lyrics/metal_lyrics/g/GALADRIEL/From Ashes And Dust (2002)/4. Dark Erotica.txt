Be my dark angel tonight
Transfer me through your blazing passion
With deep shadows in your face
I'm resigned to your erotic fantasy

I feel the galactic hurricanes
Deep inside your temple of your ecstasy

There's the night of our sins falling
When the suffering brings me the delight
When your body is forcible as cosmos
When your snivel is crying of Lucifer

Thousand years can exist these moments
It's not enough for my desires
I want to taste every piece of you
Loving you, oh, never-ending

I feel your instincts to feed by me
To drown in my infinity
I feel your sigh at my breast
And your arms at all my skin

Dragon's claws struggle to my blood
You rise naked over me like a sphinx
Like a gods of atrocity in us
I feel you all around me
