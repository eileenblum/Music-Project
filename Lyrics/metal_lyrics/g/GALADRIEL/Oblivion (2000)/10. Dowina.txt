Twilight haze embraces horizons
Where the rivers of our past still flow
Let the cold wind blow in your heart
And let the water become the blood of your own

Time is written into walls of stone
Just stand and listen to their echoes
Take over past of this mighty place
Close your eyes and dive into shadows
