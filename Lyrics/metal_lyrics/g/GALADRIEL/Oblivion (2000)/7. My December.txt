Raven's eyes are staring at me
While flying in the wind
Bright, white pearls all around me
Magic's in (hearts of) the trees
My December - deep inside of me
My December - my heart of beauty

(I'm the) vapor over level of the lake
(I'm the) silent glow of the moon
(I'm the) crystal love in the white cold grace
The snow falling down on you

My eyes, my soul, my heart
My December, I'm soul of ice

I felt the sorrow, when a man came to me
And broke my heart to satisfy his dreams

Blood of my heart runs in snow
Your claws are tearing my face
I feel blizzard of my soul
When I'm fading away...
