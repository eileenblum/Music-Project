The symbol of lies and suffering
Nailed to the cross
With empty mind you embrace its feet
And rise your eyes up to heaven

Your cry is the consequence of your view
Just watching the world is dying by your guilt
Your false prayers satisfy you
But in this hopes I refuse to live

As your body burns in my flames
It scorches all the villainies of this world
Scorches senseless laws and orders
And burns the symbol of bleeding Christ

Why should I avoid sex, when I love a woman
Why should I not kill my father's murder
Why should I still listen, your belief is the true one
When it caused so much pain to this world

The years are lost and you go down
You find out what you loose
At the gates of eternal sleep
The crown of thorns is falling deep
...to Oblivion...
