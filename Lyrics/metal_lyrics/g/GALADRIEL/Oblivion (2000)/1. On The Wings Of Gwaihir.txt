Return from oblivion...

Embraced by the flames
I fell down, I fell in desperate anger
Into those nameless deeps
Out of time, out of any apprehension

Through black paths of Khazad-dum
Through my own fear, I've tried to find a way out
I felt the cold breathe of doom
In darkness, blind, I followed the enemy of mine

Storm and haze wreathed the mountain
As we left the bottom level of the world
On Celebdil, I gave out all my powers
And defeated magic of the Balrog's soul

Then the dark arose in my mind
I wondered out of reality
Each day was like one Ard's age
And all stars twinkled in my eyes

Naked and forgotten, I've been sent back to life
So found me Gwaihir,
He took my body and flew away...
