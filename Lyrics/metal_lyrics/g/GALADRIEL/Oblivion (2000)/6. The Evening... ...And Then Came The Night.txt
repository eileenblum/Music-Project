Sorrow was falling in the rain and tears

There was night when your eyelids fell down
Your eyes were closed
And dew ran through dust of hopes

Voices were calling into your mind
Throwing down meaning of life
That agony you felt in the last storm

Sorrow was falling in the rain and tears

I had a dream when you had die
Just the body in the grass
And I felt the cold blood on your lips

Children are scrolling through the dark
Without mother, yearning
To feel again beams of morning light

Your mind had to fly somewhere
And I didn't catch that thoughts
It was an evening in your life
And your mourning was my night

Memories, still hunt me
In my nightmares, and my dreams
