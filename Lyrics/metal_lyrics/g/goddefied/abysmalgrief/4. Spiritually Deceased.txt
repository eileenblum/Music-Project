Another one is perished
Another soul into ashes
From beyond beholding life
As a paradise impossible to reach
Lost but still wondering
Wondering why you are kept from there
The only answer you will find
Is that you are enfolded by death

Essence of darkness
Awakening souls of hell
And soon they will wake up your soul too
To drink the blood of Christianity

Dusk of hell
To darkness engaged
Souls are screaming
Soon spiritually deceased

Essence of darkness
Awakening souls of hell
And soon they will wake up your soul too
To drink the blood of Christianity
And drink to suffocate the light
So you better prepare yourself
To enjoy the unholy rites

Dusk of hell
To darkness engaged
Souls are screaming
Soon spiritually deceased
