Left to die
All are dead but you are living
It hurts inside
To see yourself alone
Search the path
Where all the dead are walking
Or live your life
Til death are closing your eyes

Life goes on
Days are growing to years
Thou have old become
Soon death will lick your tears
Prepare to cease
The light is coming closer you
It shows the path
That thou are married to

Now at last you are dead
In the mud buried to rest
At last pray and thou drift away
Now forever you will dwell
[x2]
