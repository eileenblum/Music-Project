Deep in my dreams
I am your eternal son
Lucifer you were
Born in my blood

You married the dark
And gave me eternal life
But now you are dead
Slumbering I pray
Lost in Godâs domain

Between the gates
In the ashes of a maze
I hold my breath
In my wait of death
Thereâs nothing left

You married the dark
And gave me eternal life
But now you are dead
Slumbering I pray
Lost in Godâs domain

My dark cry

You married the dark
And gave me eternal life
But now you are dead
Slumbering I pray
Lost in Godâs domain
