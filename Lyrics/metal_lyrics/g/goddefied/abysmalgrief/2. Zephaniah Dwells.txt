Bring the light
A sign of the holy sepulchre
The first born son
The one who will shreds
Sermonize
Just shroud his rotten body
But he will not die
Cause he is still got the sight

The Gods will set him free
Heâs the chosen one
Zephaniah

See the holy blood
Dripping from the trees
The Gods set him free
Cause heâs Zephaniah

See the holy blood sets him free
