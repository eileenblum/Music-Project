Rotting in hades
Never shown the light
Inhumation of shreds
The shreds of a chaotic life

Lost is my soul
Sentenced to burn in hell
And that is all that remains
In peace I never will dwell

Estinguished are the lights
Darkness my only hope
To be one with satan
In darkness I will drown

Lost is my soul
Sentenced to burn in hell
And that is all that remains
Inhumated are my shreds
