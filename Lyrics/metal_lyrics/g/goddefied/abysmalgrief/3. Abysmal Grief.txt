Inside of the trees
The ancient spirits are crying
They have lost their beliefs
Appease in their wait of dying

The gates are locked
They are trying to get in
But the guardians of Styx
Are the remains of their sin

Realize that I shall die

Ancient spirits forgiven
Outsiders of the living

The spirits of the trees
Drowning in the cease
Curse of the lost
By abysmal grief

When the trees has died
The ancient spirits are forgiven
Just ancient leftovers
Outsiders of the living
