These are the life and times of the infamous Mrs. Leslie
Widow of a nasty man who left her a life of plenty
Dining on the lawn outside her majesty's garden window
Serving tea and crumpets to a fashionable crescendo

Scheming with his highness
Steaming little tempest
Oh no, not with a teapot

And she's living a life full of regret
She plans to tell no one of the dark little secret all about...
Mrs. Leslie

Calling on Miss Cavendish of Wednesday morning's book club
Speaking ill of wealthy chaps who've fallen down drunk at the old pub
Poor old Mr. Leslie
We know alive and healthy, living in a belfry

And she's living a life full of regret
The world is going round of a dark little secret all about...
Mrs. Leslie

And she's living a life full of regret
The word has gotten round of the dark little secret all about her
In a life full of riches, she's such a needy soul
A nasty little story which is all about...
Mrs. Leslie
