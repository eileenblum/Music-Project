Given all that I have in the palm of my hand
Possessions cannot fill the need I see before me, it's up to me
I saw a little boy with blisters on his feet
I saw a man without legs reaching out for me

I've got no problems, no, no, not with you
I've got no problems, yes, yes, yes, it's true
I've got no reason, reason to complain
I've got no problems, I've got no right

Home is where the heart is, hearts with no place to live
I watch the suffering, I see the pain before me, it's up to me
I saw a little girl begging on the street
I saw a lady crying, tears fall for me

Given all that I have in the palm of my hand
There's still a little boy with blisters on his feet
There's still a lady crying, tears fall for me
