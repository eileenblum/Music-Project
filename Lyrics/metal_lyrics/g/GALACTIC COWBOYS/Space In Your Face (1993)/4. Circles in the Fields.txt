Yesterday I planted seeds (In the ground, beneath my feet)
Golden fields were flowing free (circles)
Today I look, what could it be (What's this here in front of me?)
Geometric mystery (circles)

A joke of some kind, messin' with my mind
Woke up to find...

Circles in the fields
I don't know where they come from

Smashed down unbroken stems (They never break, but yes they bend)
Perhaps the work of aliens (circles)
A symbol of God's majesty (Present from our Deity)
Or interplanetary artistry (circles)

Some kind of sign, messin' with my mind
Woke up to find...
