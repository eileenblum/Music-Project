You can call me dangerous, superstitious, passe', what you wish
You can take my freedom, education, pride, love &amp; honor

'Cause I'm through with the war you're fightin'
Body and soul dividin'
Arrogance of enlightenment
With no fear of God almighty

Idle minds wait for signs out of line
You can keep your solutions, propaganda, justice, paranoia

Desire unable to satisfy you
Happiness will deny
With no fear of God almighty

Idle minds wait for signs out of line
Eye dull minds wait for signs end of the line
