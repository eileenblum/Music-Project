[originally by KISS]In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is...

I want you

You can run you can hide but you'll never get away
You can lie and deny, but you know you're gonna pay
Never loved, never thought you could,
Treat you right girl you know I would
You can fight but tonight there's nothing you can do

I want you

You can walk in the heat, you can travel 'til you die
You can live in a dream and your life will pass you by
Every day that you hesitate never changes the hand of fate
You can fight but tonight there's nothing you can do

I want you

In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is...

I want you
