What to expect? I do not know
Will it be the end? Or just a crushing blow?
Should I heed the word on the 9th of June?
Will the Lord come back? Will it be a day of doom?

Do you believe in what I feel? Do you believe?
Do you believe in something real? Do you believe?

Will I fly away into the void?
Will the world destruct? Or am I paranoid?
The words of man will lead astray
False prophecies, but no man knows the day

Do you believe in what I feel? Do you believe?
Do you believe in something real? Do you believe?

We did not shake, we did not sink
Puts me on edge, makes me think

Do you believe in what I feel? Do you believe?
Do you believe in something real? Do you believe?

Do you believe in what I feel? Do you believe?
Do you believe in something real? Do you believe?

Do you believe in what I feel? Do you believe?
Do you believe in something real? Do you believe?
