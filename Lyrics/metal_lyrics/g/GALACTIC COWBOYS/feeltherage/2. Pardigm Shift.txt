Unsettled, angst driven, disaffected generation
Hastened by the joy of laughter
Fall away from ever after

Something's happening there
Something's happening there
Something's happening there

Unstill and borrowed
The more you know, the more you sorrow
Abandoning the search for meaning
If every failure amounts to nothing

Something's happening there
Something's happening there
Something's happening there

Something's happening there
Something's happening there

My my, hey hey...
The kids have found a place to play
Geeks and freaks and creeps and paupers
Fall away from what you offer

Something's happening there
Something's happening there
Something's happening there
Something's happening there

Something's happening there
Something's happening there...yeah!
