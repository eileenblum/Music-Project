No life in their eyes always terrified
At the end of time social genocide
And you can't decide where to run and hide
No drug left that you haven't tried

Fighting zombies day and night
And one day you caught my eye
Together we'll survive even for just one night

It all makes sense to me now
That I would find the perfect one
It all makes sense to me now
That I would find you on the last day of the world

Walking to the beat of technology
Bowing the knee to the powers that be
It seems society has a bad disease
Apocalyptical psychology

Fighting zombies day and night
And one day you caught my eye
Together we'll survive even for just one night

It all makes sense to me now
That I would find the perfect one
It all makes sense to me now
That I would find you on the last day of the world

They're everywhere!
We live in fear!
They're everywhere!
The end is near!

Zombies!
Zombie attack!

Together we'll survive even for just one night

It all makes sense to me now
That I would find the perfect one
It all makes sense to me now
That I would find you on the last day ofâ¦

It all makes sense to me now
That I would find the perfect one
It all makes sense to me now
That I would find you on the last day of the world

Zombies!
