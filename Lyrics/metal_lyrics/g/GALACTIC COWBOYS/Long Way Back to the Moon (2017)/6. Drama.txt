My mamma said
To leave a sleeping dog alone
Don't feed the bears
They need a place to call their own

No way to live
Walking on eggshells all around
Always on guard
Tip toe through mine fields full of doubt

You ask me why
Can't I see things your way
The curtain opens wide

Drama
Set the stage for your attack
Drama
Bracing for the final act
I just don't want to see you and yourâ¦

If you are wise
Don't make a snake your closest friend
A bad idea
He'll always bite you in the end

Like OCD
Keeping on file my every word
For later use
In fighting wars subjective truth

You ask me why
Can't I see things your way
The curtain opens wide

Drama
Set the stage for your attack
Drama
Bracing for the final act
I just don't want to see it
I just don't want to see you and your
Drama
Drama

The curtain opens wide

Drama
Set the stage for your attack
Drama
Bracing for the final act
I just don't want to see it
I don't need a private screening
The curtain's coming down on all your
Drama
