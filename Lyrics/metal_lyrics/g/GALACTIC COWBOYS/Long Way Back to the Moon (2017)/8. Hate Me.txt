I'm just walking down the street
Trying to make my way in the world
Through crowds of vagrants pissing themselves
Talking to themselvesâ¦
And they're judging me with their eyes!
You don't know me!!!

Chocolate covered Christians passing by
Dingy stained glass window sacrifice
Paralyzed saccharin smiles
Slits for eyes

Turning heads closing eyes
But I will deny
I will deny you

Come on and hate me
Come on and hate me, come on hate me
Come on and hate me
Come on and hate me, get in line!

Old world dead and new world closing in
Enlightened now we don't believe in sin

Right/wrong â right/left â left behind
Legislate indoctrinate
But I will defy, I will defy you

Come on and hate me
Come on and hate me, come on hate me
Come on and hate me
Come on and hate me, get in line!

Narcissistic face of arrogance
Lacerated heart of innocence

Oh what fresh hell is this I'm living in?
Overtone overthrow
But I will begin I will begin

Come on and hate me
Get in, stand in, wait in line!
