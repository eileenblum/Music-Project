When I was twelve it was all fun
All fun and games

All for the thrill, the usual drill
That's what it became

Mama says she can't see my eyes
Mama says that I don't look right
Mama asks me if I'm all right

See the doctor for some therapy
Says that this will get the best of me
Says the clinic is the place to be

It's only time and chance
It's only circumstance

Blaming me, blaming you
And we're losing ourselves
Blood on me, blood on you
And we're losing ourselves

As life rolled on bored of it all
In need of escape

Habitually reality was losing its shape

Family says I gotta give it up
Friends say I gotta drop the stuff
I can never seem to get enough

Hey buddy can you spare some time?
Hey buddy can you spare a dime?
Hey buddy can you get me high?

It's only time and chance
It's only circumstance

Blaming me, blaming you
And we're losing ourselves
Blood on me, blood on you
And we're losing ourselves

No way to cope and we're
Losing ourselves
Don't give up hope
While we're losing ourselves
