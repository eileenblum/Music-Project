It's one of those things you can't get out of your head

I spent today,
Another day hoping for a better day
Another day,
A better day hoping for another day

Fight!
Fighting the same fight
Fight!
Losing the same fight

Drowning in the rain of my bloodshot eyes
From the things I despise
Blinded by the light in the deep blue sky
And the blood in my eyes

It's one of those things
You can't get out of your headâ¦

Futility crushing me, praying for stability
Disunity surrounding me,
Numbing and confounding me

Fight!
Fighting the same fight
Fight!
Losing the same fight

Drowning in the rain of my bloodshot eyes
From the things I despise
Blinded by the light in the deep blue sky
And the blood in my eyes
