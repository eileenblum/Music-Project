Take a trip with me to a distant place
A world unknown to the imagination

You spread your wings
And you look above

Your mind forgets
The cotton fields
Bring fascination

Fly high in the sky
Up in the clods

You're high above
Where the mind's at peace
The answer's clear
The heaven lies bring inspiration

Fly high in the sky
Up in the clouds
