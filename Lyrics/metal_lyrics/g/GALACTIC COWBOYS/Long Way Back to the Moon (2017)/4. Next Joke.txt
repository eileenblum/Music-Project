Alright!

If I believe in something hard enough
Feel it deep within like it was meant to be
Seal it on my heart and block out all the negativity

The sky is the limit when you put your mind to it
You can be anything you want
When you wish on a star you can have anything
You can have anything you want
Next joke!

I've always been a stranger in my skin
Like someone locked me in to a deal I can't fulfill
There's no way I can fail if I never give in to their will

The sky is the limit when you put your mind to it
You can be anything you want
Next joke!
When you wish on a star you can have anything
You can have anything you want
Next joke!

You can go very far when you reach for the stars
You can have anything you want
Next joke!
Nothing can stop you now you can have anything
You can have anything you want
Next joke!

The sky is the limit when you put your mind to it
You can be anything you want
Next joke!
When you wish on a star you can have anything
You can have anything you want
Next joke!

You can go very far when you reach for the stars
You can have anything you want
Next joke!
Nothing can stop you now you can have anything
You can have anything you want
Next joke!
