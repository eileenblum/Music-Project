Tell your friends
It's happening again
They're the greatest band you've never heard

So obscure
When they come to your town
No one ever seems to get the word

So underrated you're overrated yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype
So underrated you're overrated yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype, yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype, alright!

What a shame
They should've been so huge
Where's the recognition they deserve?

Missed the boat
Their genius overlooked
Apparently the masses aren't concerned

So underrated you're overrated yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype
So underrated you're overrated yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype, yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype

It's a total freak-fest fantasy
When you're gonna be the next big thing
But you wake up and it's all a dream
Or a crimeâ¦ never mind

Time off work
To lay some basic tracks
It all comes back like they're all seasoned pros!

Crowd funding
Avoids the 9 to 5
The less they try the more their legend grows

So underrated you're overrated yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype
So underrated you're overrated yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype, yeah!
Now you're a sucker believing the hype
