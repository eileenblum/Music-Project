I'm your fear from deep inside
I'm the hate that you can't hide
I'm the demons that comprise your very soul

I'm the rose amongst the thorns
I'm the angel with the horns
I'm the deeper darker side of you

Scream bleed die
Just throw it!
Breathe deep alive
Just throw it away!

Internal masquerade â eternal disarray
It's eating up my heart today
Internal masquerade â as we drown in the decay
It's eating up my heart today

I'm the warning that you heed
I'm the lie that you believe
I'm the monster you unleash in your very soul

I'm the fire in your eyes
I'm the hope that slowly dies
I'm the deeper darker side of you

Scream bleed die
Just throw it!
Breathe deep alive
Just throw it away!

Internal masquerade â eternal disarray
It's eating up my heart today
Internal masquerade â as we drown in the decay
It's eating up my heart today
