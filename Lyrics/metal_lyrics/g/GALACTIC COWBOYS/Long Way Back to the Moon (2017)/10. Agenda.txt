Can I refuse the things you choose
On a baseless truth?
Will you judgment always stand?

Can I make up my mind
Or must I comply?
The hive has stated its demands

From where I sit
I just don't fit
In the agenda

If you're like me
Fight to be free
Of the agenda

It's political, undeniable
We're equally miserable
Denominate to lowest math

It's unnatural
The individual
Bows to mob rule of the land

From where I sit
I just don't fit
In the agenda

If you're like me
Fight to be free
Of the agenda

Your plans unfold
And the future sold
Like days of old
'Til your time comes to an end
