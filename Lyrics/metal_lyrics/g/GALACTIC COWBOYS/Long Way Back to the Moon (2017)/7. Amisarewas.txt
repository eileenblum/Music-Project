In the world we live
In the time
In the era
In between birth and death
We strive
We believe
But wondering

Where is the treasury
Of knowledge
Of reason
Of life and ideas?
Some start in the now
Rejecting the past
Believing unshakably in things that don't last
In things that don't last

Am, is, are, was
All that has been done
Be, been, being
All that's yet to come
Thy will be done

Sum of all knowledge
Source of all being
In nature refined
The one and many
The votive divine
From beginning benign
Eternal design so high and sublime

Am, is, are, was
All that has been done
Be, been, being
All that's yet to come
Thy will be done
