Floating weightless as I look up in the sky
Trying to remember how I used to fly
My head is spinnin' and I need to go back home
To where I used to live
Because I'm tire and I'm sick of this

Stress struggle crashing rubble
Falling faster

But now I know

It's a long way back to the moon
Waiting for contact very soon
It's been a long, long time
Since I had a ranch on mars
It's a long way back to the moon

The pressure's building and my head is in the clouds
Try to breathe it in, but my breath is running out
The worlds is spinnin' and I need to go back home
To where I used to live
Because I'm tiredâ¦ and I'm sick of this

Stress struggle crashing rubble
Falling faster

But now I know

It's a long way back to the moon
Waiting for contact very soon
It's been a long, long time
Since I had a ranch on mars
It's a long way back to the moon

And now I know

My head is spinnin' and I need to go back
