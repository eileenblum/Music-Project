Say goodbye to Utopia

They know what you want
But they want to hear you
Screaming in the streets

Giving up your freedom
Trading it for lies

Falling for solutions already supplied
Lifting up your fist as if you will arise
The leader that you look to wears a new
Disguise

So get in line

Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye to my brave new world
Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye say goodbye

You can feel it coming
The ground is moving
Underneath your feet

Collecting all the data
Connecting every dot
Removing any remnants of the life that you forgot
Providing all you want
Providing all you need
Liberty and freedom are a distant memory

So follow me

Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye to my brave new world
Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye!

We don't want this
We don't need this
We don't like this
Give us what we deserve

We'll set you free

Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye to my brave new world
Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye!

Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye to my brave new world
Say goodbye to my utopia
Say goodbye say goodbye say goodbye

We don't want thisâ¦
