Everyone makes choices
But I can't say which is right
And everyone makes promises
And only meant to lie
And I don't know what to do
And I don't know just what to say anymore
This is my life and times.

Lying down in darkness
With my ear against the door
I closed my eyes and caught
A fleeting glimpse and wanted more
Of the life that struck my soul
With feelings too great to ignore
But this is my life and times.

The seconds turn to days
And now I'm older
And I know it's time for me to start anew.
But I buckle from the weight
That's on my shoulders
And I need someone to help me through.

Daddy couldn't speak to me
Before he ceased to live
Although he held his hands to me
My eyes could not forgive
All the pain that they had seen
And hoped my mind would not relive
But this is my life and times.
