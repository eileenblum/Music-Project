Another day of winter
The sweat is building up
It always fails to amaze me
The ignorance erupts

Sandpaper grinding down
Turned my ego to a frown

Swimming in December
It's snowing in July
I'm trying to remember
I've forgotten how the thorn got in my side

Kick me in the stomach
It's supposed to be that way
Thank you for another
Can I have some more today?

No encouragement, no shot
No "I'm sorry" - thanks a lot!
"Just be glad for what you've got."

Eleven years of wonder
I never figured out
The one who knows the score
But I'm not playing anymore
