Calling zealots of the inane
Dwelling on microcosmic lane
Outside the cosmic play unfolds
Indifferent to the truth that you hold

Screamin' in the streets with fists held high

Wavin' your flag in the air
Metal and leather and hair
Do you want to know if I even care?

When all the answers are made clear
Silence is all mankind will hear

Marchin' in the streets with arrogant pride

Wavin' your flag in the air
Rainbows and leather and flair
Do you want to know if I even care?
Wavin' your flag in the air
Civilization beware
Do you want to know if I even care?

I don't care.

Wavin' your flag in the air
Anger, rebellion, despair
Do you want to know if I even care?

I don't care.
