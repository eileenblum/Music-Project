Life's not boring it's just ordinary
Like birds at rest inside a sanctuary
Where the ancient meets contemporary
Life's not usual it's ordinary

Life's not futile it's just ordinary
If love is free and substitutionary
Pain is bearable and momentary
Life's not typical it's ordinary

Life's not predictable it's ordinary
The here and now in only temporary
For a futuristic visionary
Life's not fleeting it's just ordinary
