I get by in a different way
I get by in this life in a different way
I get by in a different way.

I get high in a different way
I've got hope to cope with the everyday
I get high in a different way.

No other life will ever do
No other way can see me through
No other way.

I see things in a different way
I see color and life when there is gray
I see things in a different way.

I feel love in a different way
I've got hope to cope with the everyday
I feel love in a different way.

Looked at as one peculiar soul
Who prayed that God would not let go.

I get by in a different way
I've got something real.
