The future knocked on my door and I turned it away
The future knocked on my door and I was watchin' TV
The future knocked on my door but I was afraid
The future knocked on my door and I turned it away

Hope it comes back again
I'll be ready this time

The future knocked on my door and I turned it away
The future knocked on my door and I was nursing my needs
The future knocked on my door but I was delayed
The future knocked on my door and I turned it away

Hope it comes back again
I'll be ready this time

The future knocked on my door and I turned it away
The future knocked on my door and I was losing my mind
The future knocked on my door but I was insane
The future knocked on my door and I turned it away

Hope it comes back again
I'll be ready this time
