Another hill
Another monster we can kill
A broken will
That tells me we are not alone
And it's comforting to know

It makes no difference
If it's said a million times
The word of life runs through our veins
Never forsaking me
You've brought me to my knees
And I will love you.

Another hill
Another hard to swallow pill
A void to fill
That tells me we are not alone
And it's comforting to know

You never leave me
We're not alone.
