More and more you're lookin' in
Play the game and never win
More and more I push inside
The negative and let it slide away

All the pain I fear in life
Becoming petrified...I internalize

More and more I feel the hand
Helping me to understand
More and more I wage a war
Fighting in the very core of me

All the pain I fear in life
Become petrified...I internalize
Locked away and try to hide
Never more the wise...I internalize

Sorrow needs a place to go
See the me you'll never know
