So this is how the record ends
I found an empty box again
We used to have a passion play
But something all went wrong at the end of the day.

And I can't sleep and I can't eat
See me spin again
Not too sweet and missed a beat
But it's how the record ends.

I love the way the song begins
But disappointed by the end
Congratulations go to you
A special place awaits for all you put me through.

This is the last song and goodbye
Don't be a beast at least I gave the thing a try.

I'm so sorry how this record had to end.
