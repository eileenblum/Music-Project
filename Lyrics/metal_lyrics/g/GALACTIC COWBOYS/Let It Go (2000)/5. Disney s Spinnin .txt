Looks like now the Beatles weren't so bad
Mr. Manson makes the Four look fab
'Cause death and evil is what sells today
And Walter Disney's spinnin' in his grave.

Grandpa's Woodstock acid wasn't brown
President lit up and passed it down
The days of outrage have all gone away
I bet that Disney's spinnin' in his grave.

Remember back to days when
Kids were kids and it was fun
And the kids didn't carry guns
While we were pleasure hunting
We got tricked like Elmer Fudd
Brainwashed by the media.

Inconvenienced by a small mistake
Mother chooses to exterminate
I wonder what the forefathers would say
The land of the free, home of the depraved
I bet that Disney's spinnin' round
I bet that Disney's spinnin'
I bet that Disney's spinnin' in his grave.
