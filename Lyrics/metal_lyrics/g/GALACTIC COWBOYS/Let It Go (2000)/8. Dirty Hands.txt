I knew a man with dirty hands
He blamed it all on me.
He tried to sue my point of view
'Cause he wants it all for free.

Got no wigwam
To call his own.
You can page him,
But he's got no phone.

I knew a man with dirty hands
Greets you with smiles full of teeth.
Was no surprise he had stars in his eyes
And a hole in his soul underneath.

Got no passport
To travel abroad.
Cash conversion,
Deception and fraud.

I knew a man with dirty hands
He wants it all for free.
