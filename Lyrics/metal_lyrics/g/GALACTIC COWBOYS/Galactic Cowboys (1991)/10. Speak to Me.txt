Three o'clock in the morning, voice inside my head
I'm wide awake I should be sleeping, voice alive or dead
Someone screaming out a warning, should I heed the call
A messenger I should be knowing, voice inside my head

I made it through another year
Crying yet another tear
Pondering the endless questions of life

My undivided attention, voice returns again
The pressure builds I feel the tension, voice inside my head
What should I do with all you've given, discern the ring of truth
I'm not the kind to be so driven, the choice is up to you

I made it through another year
Crying yet another tear
Pondering the endless questions of life
I made it through another year
Crying yet another tear
Pondering the things I dream in the night

You know just what to say
Speak to me.
You know just what to say
Speak to me.

You know just what to say
Speak to me.
You know just what to say
Speak to me.

Three o'clock in the morning, voice inside my head
A word of peace my mind is soaring, remember what He said
In the silence He is calling, direction is made clear
A message to my heart imploring, voice of God I hear

I made it through another year
Drove away another tear
Pondering the endless questions of life
I made it through another year
Pushed away another fear
Pondering the things I dream in the night

Nothing's quite the same after You speak to me
Speak to me
