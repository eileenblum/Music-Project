Stranger things happen to a boy like me, clearing out my senses for reality
Seems everyone I meet sees through me
They're always trying to pursue me
Oh, reaching out! Oh, calling out!

Why can't you believe in me? Oh! Why can't you believe in me! Oh!

Silhouette kneeling in a garden, tears falling down like rain
Knowing that soon they will pursue him
They always seem to misconstrue him
Oh, he's reaching out. Oh, calling out.

Why can't you believe in me? Oh! Why can't you believe in me! Oh!
