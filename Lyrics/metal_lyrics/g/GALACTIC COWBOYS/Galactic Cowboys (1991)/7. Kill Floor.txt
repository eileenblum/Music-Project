Man has got to work to eat, and this is what I do 5 days a week
I'm at this place from 9 to 5, I get a salary for taking life

They send 'em in, I send 'em out
My hammer carries a lot of clout
Blood doesn't bother me no more
They put me on the kill floor, workin' on the kill floor!

Death has become a way of life, I see the bills and hear my nagging wife
I spend my day inflicting pain, this kind of job could drive a man insane
Don't feel compassion anymore, they put me on the kill floor

There's nothing to do when I check out, so me and my hammer go house to house
Working on the kill floor...
