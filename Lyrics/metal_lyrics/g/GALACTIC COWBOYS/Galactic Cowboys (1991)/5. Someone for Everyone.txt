When the final sun has set in the sky
Didn't want to be alone, didn't want to be alone
Remembering the days when horses couldn't fly
And the earth was my home, didn't want to be alone
Sailed the galaxy to find where you are, my father used to say...

There is someone for everyone, there is someone for everyone
Well my father said don't worry son, there is someone for everyone

Floating weightless in an infinite space
Don't want to be alone, don't let me be alone
Exploration for a heavenly face
A love of my own, don't let me be alone

Always searching for that one perfect star, filled with sorrow on the way
By the journey's end you'll know who you are, my father used to say...

Don't abandon me, please don't abandon me...
Sailed the galaxy to find where you are!
