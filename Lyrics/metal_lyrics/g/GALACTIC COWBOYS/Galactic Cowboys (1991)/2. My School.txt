My mind is like a video of memories, but I don't know if I'm crazy
In the classroom I would pray I wouldn't have to read that day, I was lazy
People thought but didn't say, I turn the page of red and gray...I'm bolder
The golden boys who got the girls are going bald with no more curls, they're older
Well, the moon is full tonight and I'm going back, tell me where you are tonight
'Cause I'm going back to my school, going back to my school

Teachers smirked but never knew what I had inside and when I'd grow I'd show them
But I realized the other day it wouldn't matter what they'd say, I'd know when
Well, the moon is full tonight and I'm going back, tell me where you are tonight
'Cause I'm going back to my school, going back to my school

You locked me up inside, my feelings I denied
Well, the moon is full tonight and I'm going back, tell me where you are tonight
'Cause I'm going back to my school, going back to my school
Tell me where you are, oh, tell me where you are tonight
Oh, tell me where you are tonight?
