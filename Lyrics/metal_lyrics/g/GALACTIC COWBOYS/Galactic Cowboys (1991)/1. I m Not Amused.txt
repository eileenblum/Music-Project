A cloak of mystery, a beating heart
He prays for sympathy, they do their part

Can't you see it's not amusing anymore
We're not amused by all the blood upon your floor
It's going farther than it's ever been before
Oh, can't you see it's not amusing anymore

No look of innocence in deep blue eyes
So weathered through the years, the young one cries
A starry night in May, he slipped away
They find his shallow grave, someone will pay

Can't you see it's not amusing anymore
We're not amused by all the blood upon your floor
It's going farther than it's ever been before
Oh, can't you see it's not amusing anymore

A starry night in May, he slipped away
They find his shallow grave, someone will pay

Can't you see it's not amusing anymore
We're not amused by all the blood upon your floor
It's going farther than it's ever been before
Oh, can't you see it's not amusing anymore

We're not amused!
