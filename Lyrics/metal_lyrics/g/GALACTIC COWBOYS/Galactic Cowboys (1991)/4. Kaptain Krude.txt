Sailing on the ocean stewed
Feel asleep while steering...Kaptain Krude!
Had a bit too much of the brew
There is a rock approaching...Kaptain Krude!

Into the crystal water spewed
A liquid devastation...Kaptain Krude!
Spilling black into the blue
Why have the fish stopped swimming...Kaptain Krude!

Take a slide on the slick, take a swim and you'll stick
Take a ride with Kaptain Krude
Take a slide on the slick, take a swim and you'll stick
Take a ride with Kaptain Krude
Take a slide on the slick, take a swim and you'll stick
Take a ride with Kaptain Krude
Take a slide on the slick, take a swim and you'll stick
Take a ride with Kaptain Krude
Aye yai yai yai yai yai yai yai...Kaptain Krude!
Aye aye aye aye aye...Kaptain Krude! Aye aye aye aye aye aye!
