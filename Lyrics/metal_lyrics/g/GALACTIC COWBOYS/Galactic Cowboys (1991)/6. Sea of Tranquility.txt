Passing through Shanghai, looking down, on my way to Bombay, looking down
I was in search for something, looking down, a little out of the ordinary, looking down

There is a place in space beyond our sense of time, there is a time beyond space!
Sea of tranquility!

A patchwork quilt of sea and land, leave the ground
The magic of the creator's hand, looking down
A kaleidoscope view that changes in flight, speed of sound
A cosmic array of artistic delight, speed of light

There is a place in space beyond our sense of time, there is a time beyond space!
Sea of tranquility!

Dream soaring high. Dream soaring high.

There is a place in space beyond our sense of time, there is a time beyond space!
Sea of tranquility!
