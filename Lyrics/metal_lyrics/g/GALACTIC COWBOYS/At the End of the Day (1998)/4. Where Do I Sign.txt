Hello - fellows - I know what you need
I'm your - savior - I'm the hand that feeds

Hey man, I know I can trust you
Come on let's stop wasting time
And where do I sign?

Have faith - there's no way - you'll get through the door
Believe - you're naive - but I've been there before

Hey man, I know I can trust you
I know I won't get burned this time
And where do I sign?

And we'll do things your way
And we're learnin' the hard way.
