I've always kept to myself
I've always been a model citizen
I've always kept my nose clean
I've always stayed out of your business

Bit my tongue when I should've said
Something about the shape you're in

I've always kept to myself
I've always let you have your privacy
I've always kept my hands clean
No one could beat your secret out of me

Bit my tongue when I should've said
Something about the shape you're in

Except for the time I didn't
Except for the time that I didn't rely
On the feelings inside
Except for the time that I didn't deny
A worthy reply...except for the time

I've always kept to myself
I've always been a model citizen
I've always kept my nose clean
I've always stayed out of your private business
