Butterflies sunflowers
Walking hand in hand
Two adrift in a moments glance
Rainbows wildflowers
A promise made in haste
Two embark on a fated chance
On blind romance
I thought you were in love
What a fool's mistake
I don't care about love now
It's true I'm through
There were times when I had faith
When I'd see something in your face
Then it all just went away
And turned to hate
I thought you were in love
What a fool's mistake
I don't care about love now
It's true I'm through
You assume all my feelings
And live with your lies
Your heart's overflowing
While mine is cast aside
Island incense and memories of you
I thought we were in love
What a fool's mistake
I don't care about you now
What a twist of fate
I don't care about love now
It's true I'm through
