Set me free
Cut the strings
Break the ties and leave it all behind.

Set me free
I got the news
The strings are loose, I've taken back my life.

We built a ranch on Mars
Tried to live among the stars
But the fire came and burnt
The whole place down.

Set me free
It's haunting me
The memories I constantly relive.

Set me free
Begin again
Heal the wounds, I'm learning to forgive.

We built a ranch on mars
There were way too many scars
And the floods came and they washed
It all away.
