Lips of a lover
Where an endless source of milk and honey flow
Mind for the people
Before a word is spoken all my needs are known
He's just a regular guy tells the occasional lie
He's got something to hide but then so do I
Eyes of a servant
Waiting hand and foot to give everyone more
Smile of a jackal
That is feasting on the fat of its reward
He's just a regular guy tells the occasional lie
He's got something to hide but then so do I
With a checkered past he cuts me slack
He can feel my pain like a long lost friend
I want someone who will be just like me
I want someone who can be just like me
I want someone who will...
Never focus on the negative in life
It's always handy when you cover up a crime
Mom and daddy love him everybody loves him
He will never let us down
I want someone who will be just like me
Just like me...
