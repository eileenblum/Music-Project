Life just threw a left hook to my chin and knocked me down.
Tried to get back up but sorrow pushed me to the ground.
But I say...

It's not over.

Fear would rise and crystallize and force me to my knees.
Lack of faith and hell awaits would be my destiny.
But I say...

It's not over.

One more bout to go
In the last round of this fight.
And I'm up against the ropes
And it looks like there's no hope.
But I say...

It's not over.
