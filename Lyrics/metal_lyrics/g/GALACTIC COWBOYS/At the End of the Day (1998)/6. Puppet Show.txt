Right this way and don't be shy
You're not gonna believe your eyes
An apple we can over-hype
A little green and way too ripe.

Dancin' little freaks of mine
Helpless bouncin' on the twine.

Right this way come on let's go
Step up to the puppet show
Amazing feats of mind control.

Watch my toys I treat them nice
Strap your freedom in a vice

Dreams come true I seal your fate
Geppetto will intimidate.

And it may look funny
Well look at me
And it may sound funny
But set me free.

I can't live in this box anymore.
