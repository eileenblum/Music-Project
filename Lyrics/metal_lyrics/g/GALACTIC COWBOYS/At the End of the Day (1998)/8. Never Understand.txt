Run through machines
Now I know what it all means
Chewed up by a corporate scheme
Spit out by machines.

Gone are the plans
Lost my faith in fellow man
Cheated by another scam
How could I've been so blind?

Oh, it's so hard to understand
I can never understand 'cause I'm too
Close to the situation
It's hard to understand and I'm dealing
With the contradictions
It's so hard to understand
I can never understand.

Under a sleeve
Hidden knife that made me bleed
Victim of stupidity
Duped by a machine.

Just because you can't see me
Don't mean I don't want your money.
