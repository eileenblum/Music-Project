We learned to regret it
And we're tryin' to forget it
Everyday that we can.

Denied all the credit
Was it our fault 'cause we let it
Slip away through our hands?

How does it feel to be so strong?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be alone?
How does it feel?

We were king of the planet
And we took it all for granted
Who deserves all the thanks?

Like idiots trusted
Feel asleep and woke up busted
On the way to the bank.
