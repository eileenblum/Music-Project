Remember then? Good and plenty days
When the wind blew clouds in shapes as the sun beat down
Remember then? Now and later days
When the kids came out to play
All of life was now
And the future seemed so far away
And we'd shine shine shine
Runnin' through the dandelions in the summertime of my life
Remember then? Bit o honey days
Back when 8-tracks were the craze with that far-out sound
And the future seemed so far away
And we'd shine shine shine
Runnin' through the dandelions in the summer sun havin' fun
And we'd shine shine shine
We were happy by design in the summertime of my life
I never had a second thought about lookin' back
If I was headed down that road there'd be no turnin' back
Remember then? Good and plenty days
When the wind blew clouds in shapes as the sun beat down
And the future seemed so far away
Shine shine shine runnin' through the dandelions
In the summer sun havin' fun
And we'd shine shine shine we were happy by design
In the summertime of my life
