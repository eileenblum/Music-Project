Zero was a hotshot a dozen years ago
So opinionated he'd give 'em all a show
Heart attached to his sleeve by silver-plated cords
Million dollar moonbeams and billion dollar words

LATELY THERE'S BEEN NOTHING TO SAY
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY
WHY IS THERE NOTHING TO SAY?

No one paid attention to what he had to say
Doubt and apprehension, his loss was no one's gain
So he set his sights on money all that mattered was the green
'Til all of the excitement had turned to apathy

LATELY THERE'S BEEN NOTHING TO SAY

Caught a glimpse of heaven like needles in the eye
More than undeserving it begs the question, why?

NOTHING TO SAY
