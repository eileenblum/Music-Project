OK they all say you're a winner now
Save face, win with grace
But you don't know how

So big your heads gonna crack
Someday your arms gonna snap
From pattin' yourself on the back

Big drag hate to brag but you always do
Been told that you're gold
And ya think it's true

Don't ya know I'm a winner now
Don't ya know I'm a winner now
You know I'll never be a loser
