What a good boy I've been, a humanitarian
Done what's right in my own eye
With just a little compromise

Every good boy does fine
Does his best for all mankind
Appearance of integrity
Keep him barking up that tree

In this life I've accumulated knowledge &amp; reason
In this life I've put up a good fight but never won

Good boys always finish last
Just a relic of the past
Might as well just pack my bags
'Cause it's all just filthy rags

In this life I've realized who's in my reflection
