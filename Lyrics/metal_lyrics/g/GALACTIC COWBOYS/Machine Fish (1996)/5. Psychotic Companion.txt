Please, come on in
Welcome to my neighborhood of psychic friends
Hey, here we go
I will tell you things that you already know

Goin' to Hawaii, so says Mr. Spivey
Cosmic operator standing by

Won't you be my friend, Psychotic Companion
Keep me on the line, spending every dime

Try not to laugh
But I foresee some danger in your psychopath
No mental blocks
But I will charge you every minute that we talk

Hooked into an I.V. right to Mr. Spivey
Cosmic operator standing by
