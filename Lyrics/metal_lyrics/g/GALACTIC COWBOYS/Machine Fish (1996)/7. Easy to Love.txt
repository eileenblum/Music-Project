Like the bristles through your hair
The memories flowing through the air
Now comes a time to reminisce
Excitement of the virgin kiss

You were so hard to find the words to a rhyme
Just in the nick of time, a vision, a sign
And you were so easy to love
You were a gift sent down from above

You ask me to produce a list
Of reasons why I can't resist
The pictures point toward the truth
The feelings paint the final clue

You were the one so fine, fixed in my mind
Put my thoughts in rewind, and there I would find
That you were so easy to love
Promise of hope sent back by a dove
And you were so easy to love
