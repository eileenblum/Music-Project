I can't say just how it began
Drivin' across the western sand
Something I could not understand
Overcome by this Lentenland

Drive into a Red Sun
I can feel it wrap around my soul
Drive into a Red Sun
I can feel the future take control
...as I drive

Oh, the next move is mine
I knew this chance would come in time
Weaving its way into my mind
Where the mortal reaches divine

Drive into a Red Sun
I can feel it wrap around my soul
Drive into a Red Sun
I can feel the future take control
...as I drive

Hey man, you're gonna change the world
You're gonna change the world, you're gonna

Drive into a Red Sun
I can feel it wrap around my soul
Drive into a Red Sun
I can feel the future take control
...as I drive
