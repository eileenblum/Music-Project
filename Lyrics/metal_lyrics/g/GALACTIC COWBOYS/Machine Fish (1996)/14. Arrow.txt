Somebody shot me with their arrow
Somebody thinks that I can't see
But I've been wise to their manipulation
So I'll just plant my feet and never leave

But I can't sleep...

Somebody pierced me with their dagger
Somebody wants to see me bleed
Can't they see the things that I've done for them
In the interest of humanity

But I can't sleep...

Somebody shot me with their arrow
Somebody thinks that I can't see
But I've been wise to their manipulation
So I'll just plant my feet and never leave

Don't send me away, I don't want to go away

Somebody caught me with my guard down
I haven't had enough to eat
If I could have a chance to get my strength back
I would show the world the best of me

But I can't sleep...

Somebody shot me with their arrow
Somebody thinks that I can't see
But I've been wise to their manipulation
So I'll just plant my feet and never leave

Don't send me away, I don't want to go away

Somebody shot me with their arrow
Somebody thinks that I can't see
But I can see, yes I can see
