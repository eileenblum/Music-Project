Safe inside my mother's womb
A lonely boy in a lonely room
Raindrops hit on window glass
Looking out as people pass

I remember the past and how much it can hurt
Soaking in the depression for all that it's worth
Never wanting to leave, never wanting to stay...

In a lonely room
Where the walls were a way to escape from the world
In a lonely room
I remember the pain that I felt from inside...of my room

Hears a song and breathes a sigh
Sits and eats the humble pie
Wallows in the circumstance
Companionship is a mirror glance

I remember the past and how it hasn't changed
Always searching for answers, the questions remain
Never wanting to leave, never wanting to stay...

In a lonely room
Where the walls were a way to escape from the world
In a lonely room
I remember the pain that I felt from inside...of my room
In my room, in my room

Sittin' in darkness
I hear a whisper
I feel a presence
I hear a voice

Livin' in the darkness
I have a shadow
I feel a spirit
I feel the ghost...
Never lettin' me go
Never lettin' me go
Never lettin' me go

I remember the past and how much it can hurt
Soaking in the depression for all that it's worth
Never wanting to leave, never wanting to stay...

In a lonely room
Where the walls were a way to escape from the world
In a lonely room
I remember the pain that I felt from inside...of my room
