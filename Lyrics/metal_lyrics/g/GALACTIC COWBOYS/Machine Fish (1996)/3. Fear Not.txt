Time to leave the craft, with all my strength I open up the hatch
Parts unknown between the twilight and the danger zone

Fear not - no fear
Feelin' no pain - fearless
Will be my name - gonna walk
And I'm not gonna be afraid
Fear not

Braced for a fall, believing whether I can see it all
Fly like a swan, take a leap into the boundaries of beyond

Fear not - no fear
Feelin' no pain - fearless
Will be my name - gonna walk
And I'm not gonna be afraid
Fear not

Black as coal, the darkness that infringes on my soul
Isolate, ask myself if only death awaits

Fear not - no fear
Feelin' no pain - fearless
Will be my name - gonna walk
And I'm not gonna be afraid
Fear not
