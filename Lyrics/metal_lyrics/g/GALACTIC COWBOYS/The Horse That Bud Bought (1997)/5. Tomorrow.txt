I tried to call you but you were gone
Way too busy stickin' the labels on
Deciding who will swim in the talent pool- and what is cool

Cultivating more popularity
Overly concerned with what not to be
Trendy little fashions that please the eye- you'll televise

Whatcha gonna do tomorrow?
Whatcha gonna do when it's over?
I just don't fit into the clique
You're so hip you make me sick
Whatcha gonna do tomorrow?

Pay no attention to quality
Churning out the pap like a factory
The only standard is how ya feel- not what is real

You never heard a word that I said
Totally convinced that the sound was dead
Creating categories that fit the times- condition minds

You move 'em in and move 'em out like they were cattle
Burn a brand into their hide
With all apologies to L.A. and Seattle
Cloning is artistic suicide
