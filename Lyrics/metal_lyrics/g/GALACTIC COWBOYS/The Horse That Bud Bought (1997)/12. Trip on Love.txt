Christian soldiers stumbling row by row
Blindfolds tied and deepest fears in tow
In this tangled maze of mortal dreams
Sometimes it's too hard to believe

I can't stand by and watch a friend fall down
I can't stand by and watch a friend trip on love
Trip on love again

Somewhere a voice says the least hurtful way
But that can't explain away the pain
She can't unlearn, there's no return
So don't forget to watch your step

I just can't stand by and watch my friends
Trip on love
