Living by the turn of a phrase
Judging by the look on a face
I confuse, always do, and abuse, don't mean to
Then excuse, always do, in the end, I lose
Everything I do hurts someone

My life

Acting on an impulse of pain
Spinning on a perilous plane
With a word I confuse, I hurt and abuse
Worry, then excuse, in the end I lose
Everything I do hurts someone

My life

I bleed the same blood, still I offend
I walk the same path, I lose a friend
Everything I do hurts someone
Story of my life
