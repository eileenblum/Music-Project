Idolized- for years we were like glue
Paralyzed- from looking up to you
Terrified- to open up our lives
Loving eyes- cut through me like a knife

Icy fingers shake my hand
Frozen shoulders leave me cold

You've changed
And I know we'll never be the same
You've changed. You've changed.
And the love we lost is such a shame
You've changed. You've changed.

From a confidant to someone strange
You've changed. You've changed.
Agonized- rejection unexplained
Who was I to think we were the same?

Frigid words that pierce my heart
Like an ice pick through my soul
