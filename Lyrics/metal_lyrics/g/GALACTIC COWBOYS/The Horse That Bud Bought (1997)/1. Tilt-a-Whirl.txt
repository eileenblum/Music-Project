Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Through the rain and through the snow, they
Wind it up and Watch it go

Tilt-A-Whirl â Don't know how it started
Tilt-A-Whirl â But I can't get off
Tilt-A-Whirl â I don't think I like it
Tilt-A-Whirl â But I just can't stop

Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Hickory Dickory Dickory Dock
It's all a game of beat the clock

Tilt-A-Whirl â Don't know how it started
Tilt-A-Whirl â But I can't get off
Tilt-A-Whirl â I don't think I like it
Tilt-A-Whirl â But I just can't stop

There's much to be said for laboring in obscurity
It's as underrated as the benefits of suffering
(round and round)

Tilt-A-Whirl â Don't know how it started
Tilt-A-Whirl â But I can't get off
Tilt-A-Whirl â I don't think I like it
Tilt-A-Whirl â But I just can't stop

Tilt-A-Whirl â Cuz it breaks my neck
Tilt-A-Whirl â And it curves my spine
Tilt-A-Whirl â And I can't get my balance
Tilt-A-Whirl â On this carnival ride
