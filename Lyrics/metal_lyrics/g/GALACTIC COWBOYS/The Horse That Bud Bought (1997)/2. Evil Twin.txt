It's not me messin' with your life
Givin' you the trouble and strife.
Blame it on my evil twin...

Cheatin' at the game
Not responsible for your pain.
Blame it on my evil twin.

Well, I know he's got my name
But I swear we're not the same.
Blame it on my evil twin...

Spreading the disease
I'm just a product of society.
Blame it on my evil twin.

I learned it from T.V.
You blame it your parents or police.
Blame it on my evil twin.
