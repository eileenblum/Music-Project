A prophet on a rooftop lifting up his holy hands
Shouting to the ground below
People running here, people running scared
Hiding in the shadow

Turn a blind eye, turn a deaf ear
It's all so hard to handle
All the changing minds and changing of the times
Changing the channels

I care more 'cause I know what's in store
I care more because I know the score
I can't wait!!!

A nut case in a tower polishing his holy gun
Reciting a nursery rhyme
Mama picks the kids up, gives them both a kiss
And drives them in a lake to die

People in confusion, people in despair
Solution's elemental
When all the psychological metaphysical self help
Mumbo jumbo seems so farcical

I care more 'cause I know what's in store
I care more because I know the score
I can't wait!!!
I can't wait!!!
