Quoting creeds of correctness
Cast in cannons of care
Convoluted compassion
Commiserating despair

Pin a ribbon on my heart
For the ones who've gone before
Pin a ribbon on the air
Pin a ribbon on my heart
If it proves I really care
Pin a ribbon on the air

Wearing walls within windows
Where all wishes are weighed
Wanted wages unwilling
While we watch on with dismay
