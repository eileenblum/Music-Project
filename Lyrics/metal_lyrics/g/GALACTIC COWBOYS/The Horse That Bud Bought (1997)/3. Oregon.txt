Down from the mountains word would come
We would soon move to Oregon.
Pulled from the ground of yesterday
Sell everything and move away.

But it wasn't what we thought
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
We took that trip again, my friend.

Ten of us formed a family
Jimmy and Jesus under siege.
Follow the leader it would go
Stuck in a twisted puppet show.

But it wasn't what we thought
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.
We took that trip again, my friend.

But it wasn't all for naught
Living in the house that Bud bought.
We learned so very much back then.

It was a burning bush of hungry souls
Trying to follow what our hearts were told.
But a novice played upon our fears
And the whole thing screwed us up for years.

We untied a holy knot
And we rode the horse that Bud bought.

Prophecy came and we were gone
We would soon move from Oregon.
Turning their backs on yesterday
Some of the others fell away...
