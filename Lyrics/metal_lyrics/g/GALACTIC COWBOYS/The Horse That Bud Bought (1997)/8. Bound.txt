Come along with us, Tourists on an Omnibus
Sit beside great might-have-beens, explorers of the cosmic trick
Jewels of heavenly magic in violent starry galleries
Caught in infinite instant forgiven of all dragons

In my mind I've found that the more I've found the less I find
Love's not blind but bound and the more it's bound the less it's blind

Lucid is the traveler in childlike monotony
In the grandest theatre of decorated beauty
Come along with us, Tourists on an Omnibus
