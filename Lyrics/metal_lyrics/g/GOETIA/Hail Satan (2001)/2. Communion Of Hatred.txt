Communion of hatred

Kneel down before me!
Absorb the communion of hatred!
Is the dying enough to resurrect?
Is the false belief strong enough to save from oblivion?

The bread for the weak ones
Black blood white sperm
The gathering of Fallen Angels
Illumination of the lightening

Black blood white sperm in the cup
There are five angles of pentagram
There is the key to eternity
And the gate to be found

Black blood white sperm!!!

Wrath erupts in my heart - I am the beast
Infernal salvation, I am the redeemer
I release the wrath of the Ancient Ones
Through our communion of hatred
Destruction and chaos are our only gods

This is communion of hatred!

Rage blows up in our souls We raise the fists
Eternal damnation - we bring the end to peace
We release the wrath of the Ancient Ones
Through our communion of hatred
The day of punishment for humiliation

This is my body
This is my blood
Happy are they who come to my supper
