Vineyards... thy blood

Painful lament of twilight
Bitter like the laughter of convict
Death I exalt - suicide's hymn
This is the litany for salvation

Cold nails in my wrists

I feel dull pain
As they nail me to the cross

Bloody tears - bitter tears
Flowing from my eyes
Suspended in emptiness
Where the time has never been

Bleeding...
On the Cross
Bleeding...
Mutilated

In the midst of endless silence
In indeterminate disorder
The son of man is dying
The formula of the slain god
Holy shrine of spiritual essence - brightness
The cup filled with beverage of gods
Astral bridge to mental prison of illusions
Blackest vine is thy sacrifice

"The best blood is of the moon, monthly;
Then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven,
Then of enemies, then of priest or of the worshippers
Last of some beast, no matter what"

Bleeding...
Gore drips from the walls
Bleeding...
Mutilated
Bleeding...
On the cross
Bleeding...
For ecstasy

Whole world is bleeding
Blood
Life
Suffering

I await my death
Whimpering cry infiltrates
The brains of the dreaming ones
Hooks and chains tear the body of the hangman
Internal bleeding
I am dead but still alive
Bleeding...
Inside of my soul bleed

Vineyards of blood!!!
