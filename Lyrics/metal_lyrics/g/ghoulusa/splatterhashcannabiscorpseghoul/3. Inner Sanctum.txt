[performed by Ghoul]Welcome little children
At play among the tombs
A trail of treats will lead you
into candy covered rooms

Granite pestles crush their tiny pelvises to dust
Smashing with unholy lust

You and your burnout friends
Were suckered by the witch's tale
Caves replete the devil's leaf
And a map for sale

So, to the catacombs
With plunder as your goal
Stumble bums, trap door sprung
You were knocked out cold

Welcome lonely traveler
Engaged in self abuse
Your love for iron maidens
Will be put to grizzly use

Piercing shrieks of torture from behind a metal mask
Blood collects in oaken cask

You hear a muffled scream
Through a fleshly mortared crypt
Slimy tendrils coat the walls 
Where the coffin juices drip

A filthy denim vest
You find abandoned on the chamber floor
Mortal fear; your blood runs cold
At the sound of a creaking door

The screams of your friends echo from afar
Panicked, you race through the torch lit halls
Into the Abattoir

Kill!
Kill!
Kill!

You fall to your knees
In human debris
And we chortle at your feeble cries

You kick and you scream 
As you're dragged 'cross the floor
No mercy, no pity, your destined to die

In our inner sanctum
Chained to the floor of a catacomb cell
In our inner sanctum
You will be wracked with the tortures of hell
In our inner sanctum
Tears stream from your bloodshot eyes
In our inner sanctum 
Die!
