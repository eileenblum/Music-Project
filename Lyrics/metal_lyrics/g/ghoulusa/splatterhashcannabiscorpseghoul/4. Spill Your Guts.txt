[performed by Ghoul]Screaming as the torch is lit
The muscles seize as hooks are thrust
Into your writhing torso twisting
Metal up your fucking butt

Spill your guts!
Spill your fucking guts!

Veiny ropes of innards dripping
Shit and blood from jagged cuts
Are ripping from a nauseating
Racket as I spill your guts

Gnawing at your stomach
In the offal splattered dirt
Sopping up the drippings
With your Iron Reagan shirt

Sneakers stolen and your vest is
Tattered where your ribcage juts
From under ravaged flesh now aren't you
Happy that you spill your guts?
