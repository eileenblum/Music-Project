Well Iâm a no good sickle ridinâ son of a whore
I got a face like a demon and Iâm mean as a boar
I ride a one ton hog, and Iâll give it the gas
And if you fuck around with me Iâll put a boot in yer ass
Yeah, I bleed gasoline, and I piss alcohol
Iâve got a cobra for a cock and some wrought iron balls
I got your name tattooed and you better believe
Iâm gonna cross that sucker out or my name ainât Kreeg.

I got poison in my brain, I'm the sultan of pain
I got a piece of paper here that certifies I'm insane
Iâm the boss, Iâm the king, Iâm the A number one
And the Cannibals and me are gonna have us some fun
Now I run this town, and Iâm nothinâ but fair
And if you donât agree with me youâre gonna swing in the square
I got your name tattooed and you better believe
Iâm gonna cross that sucker out or my name ainât Kreeg.

The leader of the Cannibals, his reign is supreme
Violence and chaos, a tyrannical regime
And when they come for you in the final reapening
The last thing that you're gonna see is Kreeg

We got our choppers lined up and we're runnin' you down
We're gonna rain down Hell on this shithole town
I got your name tattooed and you better believe
Iâm gonna cross that sucker out or my name ainât Kreeg.
