We're out on the road, burning up towns
Spungbein in tow, the pig-headed clown
Mutilator stinks and he won't leave the van
this mutated bore is no longer a man

Hapless twit, lives in shit,
Hooked on pills
Poor little Bill, should've made out a will now he's
Roadkill!
Roadkill!

Well he feeds on the trash, any garbage will do
Festering slop in a trough cordon bleu
His eyes have gone squinty, his mind is askew
His prick is the shape of a screw

Meta-state, re-mutate
Filthy swine
"His haunches are mine!" "Let's soak him brine!"

He's a source of disgust
An object of pity and cremator's lust
On a spit to be trussed
Terrible squeals as the blades are enthrust

Squirm little piggy and cough out your last
We'll cry in our pork chops when you've finally passed
The darkness encloses; the sound of a bell
Soon you will writhe in the wallows of hell

A lone stretch of highway, blacker than pitch
The buzzing of flies from a lump in a ditch
Passing lights from a semi rig
Carelessly dumped, the remains of a pig

Bacon bits, muscle cysts
Gore distilled
The goblets are fulled as the pig's blood spills
Roadkill!
Roadkill!
