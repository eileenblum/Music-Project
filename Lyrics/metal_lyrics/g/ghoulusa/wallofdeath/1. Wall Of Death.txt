Fear!
They're under control
The growing terror has taken a toll
With each new event, the plebes will relent

Hate!
They'll be made to hate
A scapegoat constructed, a foe to berate
The state let them in to commit mortal sin

The Acolytes preach
It will never be breached
"So build!" they beseech
Wall of death!

The commandment warns
That it's time for reforms
"It'll keep out the swarms"
Wall of death!

Rage! The people enraged
Given the choice they will choose to be caged
Shore up the dam with a labor program

Brutes! To keep them at bay
The people must do so much more than just pray
Brick upon brick will do the trick

The Acolytes preach
It will never be breached
"So build!" they beseech
Wall of death!

The commandment warns
That it's time for reforms
"It'll keep out the swarms"
Wall of death!

Bones are stacked up high
As the ashen mortar dies
Mass grave to reach the sky
To conquer and divide

Wall of death!

Strike! The hour is nigh
Peons enslave so they'll always comply
They'll beg to exist under cudgel and fist

Kill! Their hopes and their dreams
A barricade keeping the nation enseamed
The state will protect with a boot on the neck

Wall of death!
