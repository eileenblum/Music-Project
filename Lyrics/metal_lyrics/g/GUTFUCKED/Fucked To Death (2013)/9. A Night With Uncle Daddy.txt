Fucked against your will
You cry for me to stop
You will know when I am finished
You wretch away from me with a strength found in the last moments of life
But it excites me more
Wanting to taste your skin
I sink my teeth deep into your neck until the thick liquid running through you gushes into my throat
You still taste as sweet as the day you were born
You stay quiet because you know what I can do and in the end you always give in to my selfish desires
Oh how you love me yet despise what I have left inside of you
The stillbirth inside your womb my love for you has created
"You are mine and I will never let you go" are the last words you hear before the lights go dim
