There is no worse feeling than being dragged through the woods
Hands bound behind your back with no chance of escape
Completely naked leaving a trail of blood and the stench of sweat
Your vision removed with a screwdriver
Your tongue removed with a bandsaw
Most of the teeth are broken from grinding together in agonizing pain
Pulled face down to prevent you from drowning in the blood filling your mouth
Leaving human debris caught on piles of rock and stumps in the wilderness
Your pussy is wet from the glass that has been inserted and removed
Flies and filth now call your worthless hole home
No fight left for a chance at breath
And no struggle as your muscles are weakened by your loss of blood
To hang your body between the trees is an artful task to fulfill but I must present you
And I leave you to rot in the sun
