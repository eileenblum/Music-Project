Oh how you disgust me
Your voice trembles the thought of my intentions
You vile cunt
Put your face against the floor
And await the wretched
You are the stage in which I act out this putrid task
Your tainted innards wrap around my shaft
I will fill your wound
You used to spread your legs for any that desired to taste your filth
You were a hole to fill
This is the last time
There was a time you used to give it all away
And when i'm through with you, you'll have nothing left to give
I'll take it all away
You've lost your will to fight
Concede yourself to me
