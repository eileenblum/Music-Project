Your repugnant efforts are of no worth here. You Jedi are weak and your force is weaker.
Our legacy will live on for years to come through the plague of boundless onslaught,
not even the younglings will find solace nor sanctuary. the infinite power of the empire crushes all.
Your moistened whispers fall only on your fresh dead.
I will force choke the filth that is your Jedi bloodline into the ashes of the rancor pit.
The faith of millions in the darkened vice of the sith.
Know defeat, putrescence and anguish in your ways being eternally stomped from this system by all of the power that is the empire
