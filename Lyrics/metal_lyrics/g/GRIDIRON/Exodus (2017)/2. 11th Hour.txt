[Music: Z. Knight, M. Elsner, J. Cross, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley]

The hour
Is here

Time quickly erodes into a state of madness
A leviathan of preordained truth
As the event draws near in status

Approaching
As is in a terrifying dream
Denying it will not prevent
For it is as it seems
The final minute
All of prophecy
Revealing this last stand
Determining just who will live
Reveal the upper hand

The hour
Is here

Sands of time now cease to fall with prejudice
Banal world on verge and brink
Destructive end so imminent

Flying on
The winds of death
This resolution being
To a gored and ghastly state
Paralyzed by what you're seeing
You can't fight and won't win
This vision shakes your soul
The tide turned and you're burned
The end the only goal

The hour
Is here

The reaping of what you've sown
Is so close at hand
Eleventh hour has finally come
This is your final stand

[Solo: Josh]

The eleventh hour
Is here
