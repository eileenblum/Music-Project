[Music: Z. Knight, M. Elsner, J. Cross, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley, Z. Knight]

For so long we've searched for a remedy
"In men we trust" to the signs; a blind eye
How can we be free with no consequence?
Never fulfilled until we look towards the skies

Hatred and greed
On sorrow we feed
Craving the next
Dramatic entrance
With all that we see,
Don't know what we need
Too lost to the dark
To make a difference

I'm weighed down by this constant shadow
Plaguing my thoughts
Corrupting my mind
I'm chained down
By the shame of tomorrow
Mankind is lost
This world dies

So this darkness sits heavy upon my chest
Do I breathe in the air?
A great lie
Taste the forbidden
From the fallen Serpent
Banned from the gates
Lost to the light

Hatred and greed
On sorrow we feed
Craving the next
Dramatic entrance
With all that we see,
Don't know what we need
Too lost to the dark
To make a difference

I'm weighed down by this constant shadow
Plaguing my thoughts
Corrupting my mind
I'm chained down
By the shame of tomorrow
Mankind is lost
This world dies

This life is constant shadow
Bloodshed and war
Deceit and defiance
The day will come and it will be too late
To remember his word
To make our change

We have failed our creator
God take me home
God take me home
