[Music: J. Cross, M. Elsner, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley, J. Cross]

Let this pain
Serve to remind me
A perfect will
Greater than me

Now as I see all this come around
Can't let my selfish nature rule out
Just let me be
I'll keep on believing
This will is greater
Stronger than me

This thorn
In my side
This thorn
Is why

Long is the path I tread
Great is the pain to remind
Me to shed
My inner selfish needs
The weakness within
This thorn will bleed
This thorn will bleed

This thorn
In my side
This thorn
Is why
Is why

As I look to the sky
I keep on wondering why I'm still losing
This thorn in my side
That I wish I could hide your still using

"Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say, 7 or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. 8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. 9 But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. 10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
[2 Corinthians 12:6-10]
