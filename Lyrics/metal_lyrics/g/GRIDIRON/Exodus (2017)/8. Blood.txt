[Music: Z. Knight, M. Elsner, R. Knight, lyrics: Z. Knight, S. Cooley]

Bow down to your interim "God"
Clawing at your mind
Weighing down your heart
Shines bright for the eyes of man
Obsessed on the brink of
destruction

For what?
For what is it all?
Material gain
Will mean nothing when you fall

Blood
Is the answer,
You can have all the gold in the world but
Blood
Is the answer
There are no riches when the casket is shut

Bow down to the one true god
Released your tortured mind
Healed your broken heart
Blood purchased the souls of man
Released the world from the brink of destruction

For what?
For what is it all?
Material gain
Will mean nothing when you fall

Blood
Is the answer,
You can have all the gold in the world but
Blood
Is the answer
There are no riches when the casket is shut

We survive on the root of all evil
But if you reach the gates
The only value in anything you've ever done is your faith in the
Blood

Blood
Is the answer,
You can have all the gold in the world but
Blood
Is the answer
There are no riches when the casket is shut
