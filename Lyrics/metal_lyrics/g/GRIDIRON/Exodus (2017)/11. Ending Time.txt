[Music: J. Cross, M. Elsner, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley]

Waiting for the world to change
All consumed with fear
Existence was embattled
Negativity of peers
Although my soul
Was tortured
Wretched with searing pain
Visions of my past it seems
Were haunting me again

Ending time

Crushed my life was over
It was the bitter end
Rage replaced my sanity
Fight to live again
All the paths I walked it seemed
Were darkened deepest black
Past the point of all return
Never to turn back

Then it hit me
Crossed the line
I approached my ending time
Died to self
Rebirth in me
End to all the misery

Death to all
This suffering
Death to all
The suffering

[Solo: Josh]

This is mine
My dying time
This is mine
My dying time
This is mine
My rebirth

"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him."
[Romans 6:8]
