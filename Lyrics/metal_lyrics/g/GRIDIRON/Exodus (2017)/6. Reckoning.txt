[Music: M. Elsner, J. Cross, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley]

From dust you were made
To dust you return
Humanity is a waste
Today its lesson will be learned
Each one of the passing days
Ignore the signs of impending wrath
Of heaven raining your demise
For tables now have turned

Clouds unfold
Destruction now consumes the earth
Rapture has passed
Those in doubt left suffering
Unremorsefully remain behind
Are symbols of the
Apocalypse that is coming
What is this?
Can it be?
The end
Of humanity
No more grace

Fools so blind to see
The judgement comes
It's the time
Of the reckoning
For it's far too late
To change your fate
As the end has come to be
Debt will be repaid
The choice was made
On this day
Of the reckoning

Standing hopeful that
My name not called
From the list of the ones
To fall
Through the doubts my faith
Would sail
Though I suffered it
Never failed

Plagues unleashed
Marks of the approaching beast
Judgement at hand
Humanity and its last stand
Unremorsefully remain behind
Are symbols of the
Apocalypse that is coming
What is this?
Can it be?
The end
Of humanity
No more grace

Fools so blind to see
The judgement comes
It's the time
Of reckoning
For it's far too late
To end your hate
As the end has come to be
Debt will be repaid
The choice was made
On this day
Of the reckoning

The reckoning
The reckoning
The end is here
The end is here
The reckoning
