[Music: Z. Knight, M. Elsner, J. Cross, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley, Z. Knight]

There was a time
I was the one
That you believed in
Time wore on
Your faith stood still
No longer within

I kept struggling without solution
Your pain refused to heal
No possible real solution
In time this life was sealed

I am the one
Who lives in sorrow
Battered and broken
Upon my cross
With my blood
I paid tomorrow
The day will come
You'll know just what
Was lost

Distance, time
Does not heal
Levity and pain
Is real

I kept struggling without solution
Your pain refused to heal
No possible real solution
In time this life was sealed

I am the one
Who lives in sorrow
Battered and broken
Upon my cross
With my blood
I paid tomorrow
The day will come
You'll know just what
Was lost

What was lost
What was lost

Time and time
And time and time
And time and time
Again
This struggle just perpetuates
Seems never to end
Never did I think that this could ever
Seal the deal
This pain you caused
Will not go on because I choose to heal

I was the one who lived in sorrow
Battered and broken upon my cross
With my blood I paid tomorrow
The day will come
You'll know just what was lost

No more
Sorrow
