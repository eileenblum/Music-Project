[Music: Z. Knight, M. Elsner, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley, Z. Knight]

Open your eyes
The horns have sounded
Signaling the end
The end of this system
Parting the skies
The horses are mounted
A white king at the head
Charging to battle

I beg you to see
A life worth coveting

Cinder and soul
Never lose your fire
Never lose your flame
Don't let it go
I can feel the embers
Calling my name

You were reborn
A light was placed inside you
Giving you the flame
Burning inside eternal
The white king he won't fail
His power without ending
Crushing all this darkness
Winning your battles

I beg you to see
A life worth coveting

Cinder and soul
Never lose your fire
Never lose your flame
Don't let it go
I can feel the embers
Calling my name

[Solo: Zack]

Cinder and soul
Never lose your fire
Never lose your flame
Don't let it go
I can feel the embers
Calling my name

Remember the love you once had

Hold on
Please hold on
