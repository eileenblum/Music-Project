[Music: M. Elsner, J. Cross, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley]

What you don't know
Is this can hurt you
Be the reason that you will bleed
Obsessed with living
Never giving
Fulfilling all your selfish needs
You are self-obsessed
And so possessed
This very thing is bringing
You down
You know this pain brought
Selfish mind sought
This storm of swords
Brought you to the ground

Facing
The storm of swords
Realizing
Your mind forlorn
Facing
The storm of swords
Selfish
Your heart is torn

I'm surrounded
By the very power
That gives force to

The only one who
Will release
The only one who will not cease
So powerful
The three in one
Father, spirit, only son
Trinity makes me complete
In death knows no defeat

What you don't know
Is this can hurt you
Be the reason that you will bleed
Obsessed with living
Never giving
Fulfilling all your selfish needs
You are self-obsessed
And so possessed
This very thing is bringing
You down
You know this pain brought
Selfish mind sought
This storm of swords
Brought you to the ground

Facing
The storm of swords
Realizing
Your mind forlorn
Facing
The storm of swords
Selfish
Your heart is torn

I'm surrounded

The only one whom
Will release
The only one who will not cease
So powerful
The three in one
Father, spirit, only son
Trinity makes me complete
In death knows no defeat
Storm

[Solo: Josh]

Facing the storm
Of swords
