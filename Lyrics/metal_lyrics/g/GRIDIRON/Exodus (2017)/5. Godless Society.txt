[Music: J. Cross, M. Elsner, R. Knight, lyrics: Z. Knight, S. Cooley]

They are hungry,
Emaciated
Starving for the next event,
But they are drowning,
Quickly drowning,
In the maelstrom; at the end's behest

We are lost forever,
In a time where man is blind,
To rebel has been our nature,
When will we see the light?

War and violence,
Kings and tyrants,
Adding to the toll of the dead.
Clock is ticking,
Time is nearing,
To lay this system to its rest

[Solo: Josh]

We are lost forever,
In a time where man is blind,
To rebel has been our nature,
Will we ever see the light?

Bring life to all
Of this society
Bring God to all
Of this society
