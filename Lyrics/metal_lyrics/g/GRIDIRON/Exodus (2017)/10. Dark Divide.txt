[Music: Z. Knight, R. Knight, lyrics: S. Cooley, Z. Knight]

The flame is gone
Still we sift through the ashes
Piece together
What we thought could be saved
How many times
Will we bludgeon dead horses?
Contempt and discontent are all that remain

To
Breathe life into words forgotten
Bring
Hope to this dying world

Before our eyes
We see the light,
As man's knees drop to the floor
We hear their cries
A dark divide
Slowly dying evermore

The flame returns
As we rebuild the ramparts
Put together
What we knew could be saved
Just one more time
As we bludgeon the demons
Contempt and discontent will never remain

To
Breathe life into words forgotten
Bring
Hope to this dying world

Before our eyes
We see the light,
As man's knees drop to the floor
We hear their cries
A dark divide
Slowly dying evermore
Evermore

[Solo: Josh, Zack]

Before our eyes
We see the light,
As man's knees drop to the floor
We hear their cries
A dark divide
Slowly dying evermore
