Barely you can walk
With your blood-shot eyes
Wailing through the night
Self abused by hate
Losing sight of life
Living in your lies

Rain give me the rain
Give me your filthy rain
Rain give me some pain
Give me some cold hard pain
You're the answer to my question
Can you feel my dark intention
Down in hell
Down in hell

Sinful seems my day
Set your heart on fire
I did it like a liar
Betrayed all the trust
Don't know who I am
Living in your lies
