Nevermore in yours
Start to believe
Everything is out of reach
Nevermore I'd lie
Right to your face
Will this be our last embrace my dear

Behead me
Be mine in tears
That is what I want to see
I crawl here
You were my blade
Puke your last embrace on me

No matter what you do
No Matter what I say
Disappear get out of my face
No matter what you say
It's over and too late
With my life I'm gonna pay bitch
