I can't go
As long that I know
That you are somewhere
And I'm only there so
I'll find you in
Some gloomy day
Crown you in every, in every
Everybody

Be on my side
And understand
That we're thrones
And we won't come to an end
Sigh in my embrace
Feel like a little god now
When we leave they will follow

Sometimes
We will be one
And some different day
I'll be next to you so
The grey way
Will be ours
Hold you over now
And every
Everybody
