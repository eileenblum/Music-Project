Our end is on it's way
Soon we will be free
Too many tears is shed
Here in your embrace

Let me come in your arms again
Let's end this suffering
And all I need to say
Is suck it away suck it away

Le me come in your arms again
Let's end this suffering
And all I need to say is
Don't let me cry again

Replace your heart with pain
All we had is gone
Believe I've lost my faith
Lay down your fuckin' gun
