I don't know where I belong
Is somebody there to catch my fall
I'm running in circles to get where I started from
It seems like there's nowhere to turn
I drown on the streets and I'll never learn
I'm counting the days while I'm saying

No matter where you shoot me down
No matter where if you do it now
Look in my eyes I stay strong
Lost all my fear so I hold on

There is no place to call home
Roaming the street with a bag of stones
Awaiting your call but I hear nothing at all
It feels like a broken bird
Got locked in this cage of a cold cold world
I'm trying to speak without saying

No matter where you shoot me down
Don't matter where If you do it now
Look in my eyes I stay strong
Lost all my fear so I hold on

Should I bleed myself while you're smiling?
Why should I lose myself in this fighting?
Would you now hurt yourself 'cause of my lying?
So come let's drown ourself and end this nightmare
