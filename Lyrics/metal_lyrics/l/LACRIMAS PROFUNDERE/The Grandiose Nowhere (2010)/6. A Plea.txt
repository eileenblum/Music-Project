One day you will forget what I do to you
One day I try to dry all tears just to beg for you

Let you know that I
Didn't make it
In such a sad way
Let you know that I die
If you won't try to
Understand what we were

One day I maybe won't remember
These years
In those I tried to scream a plea in your deaf excuse
