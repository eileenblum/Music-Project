I love your eyes
I love your fingers too
And love your touch cold
Your poison tongue
Turned me into a fool
Maybe that charmed you

Is this what we are living for?

Drag me by the hand
Bury me
And my personality
Suck my blood
Swallow me
And my sexuality

It was a lie
A fear of solitude
The grin of sin told you
Distorted eyes
Depressed and paralysed
Reveal the sense of truth

I know your heart is cold enough for that shit......

Drag me by the hand
Bury me
And my personality
Drink my blood
Silence me
And my sensuality
