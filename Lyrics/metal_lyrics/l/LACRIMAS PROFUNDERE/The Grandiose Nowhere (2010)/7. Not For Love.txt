Why you can't bring me out of this
You are a lie and you know I cannot resist
Just leave me hanging here alone
Don't blame yourself for something you ignore
You ignore

I can't do what you've done
What you said I should
I belong to myself
Not to anyone
But this day will appear
Will arise some time
And I'm not your fucked up
Stupid anything

Why you keep treating me like this
All that I want from you is just another kiss
I fell in love with your despair
Go on just do it now cause I don't care
I don't care
