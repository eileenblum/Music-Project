You don't know what it means
All these lies and everything
And I feel like never felt before
There you lay, innocent
Swollen eyes and body spent
Was it worth?
Was it worth the pain?

Can't deny
That I need you
You don't understand what I say
Understand what I say
Believe me now
Sweet enemy
I just want to say I love you
Want to say I love you

We are one, we're the same
Beg to see you smile again
Hold your breath
Just lay beside me here
I'm the guilt you're the lust
Turning everything to dust
Was it worth?
Was it worth the pain?
