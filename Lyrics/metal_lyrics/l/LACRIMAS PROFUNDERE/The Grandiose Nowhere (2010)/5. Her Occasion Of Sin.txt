If you get hurt just go and tell someone else
With every kiss you try to make me understand
All you are longing for is my loves bitter end
I might be wrong but think you're lying once again

Heal my wounds I can't bleed everything for you
I won't need you, never needed you
Heal my wounds I can't lose everything on you
I won't need you, never needed you

With everything weeping tear you think I'll be your friend
But why don't you crawl back into your lovers hands
There's nothing left for us I don't want you to stay
Don't try to chain me 'cause I'm leaving anyway
