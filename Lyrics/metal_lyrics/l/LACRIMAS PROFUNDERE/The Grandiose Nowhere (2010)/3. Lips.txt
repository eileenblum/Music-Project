You are the one who understands
You are the one who takes my breath

Be the licking of my wounds
I'm bloodless when you leave me alone
I stand here like a hopeless fool
And never ever I will be

The one for you
Who resists

My shameless doom
My agony
Come press your wild, wild wicked lips on me
A tearful no
A bitter yes
You give me something that I really miss
(So come on)

You are the one who does not care
You are not here but everywhere

Be the end of my desire
You're bloody filthy are a liar
You won't break my heart into
Not again I won't let you

Be me, for now
But I can't leave
