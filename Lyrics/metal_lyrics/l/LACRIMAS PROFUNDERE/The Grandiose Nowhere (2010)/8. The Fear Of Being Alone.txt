Laugh at me
For everything I'm not
Lie to me
With every tear you drop
All we do is sleep
Why we cannot end?
A sin is what we need

Will I ever arise
From your cold arms again
Will you ever be mine
And I'll beg my lies to end
Lying here with fear of being alone
Loneliness is my home
Be my bride before everything turns black

Bury me
With everything I've got
Spit on me
After I've been shot
Your lies cannot fade
It's never gonna mend
It's over but I stay
