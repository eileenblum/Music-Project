So hear what grief is
Iâ live and die now
Andâ I cannot think
I let you endlessly burn in my head
You swiped my soul
Awayâ
Awayâ

You didn't feel what I felt
Foreverâ I know
Let me into your heart
No, nothing will heal the truth
And I always knew
Thatâ you will never care

And what we become
Is only a glimpse
I let you endlessly bleed in my chest
You took my hope

You didn't feel what I felt
Forever I know
Let me into your heart
No, nothing will heal the truth
And I always knew
That you will never care

I knew and will forever know
I knew and will forever know
I knew and will forever know
I knew and will forever know
I knew and will forever know

You didn't feel what I felt
Forever I know
Let me into your heart
No, nothing will heal the truth
And I always knew
That you will never care
You didn't feel what I felt
Forever I know
Let me into your heart
No, nothing will heal the truth
And I always knew
That you will never care
