Let us breathe out
We've got nothing more to lose

Not again
For the stars
That will break there
They will crumble in your heart
But pain's not over
It has just begun
And it will empty you
Till you fall through mighty doors

I'm only you and nothing more
My frozen kingdom
I adore you while you tear me down
I'll crawl to you wherever you are
I live through your hell
And I hate myself for you again

For my fears
That will grow there
And they conquer all my thoughts
But grief's not over then
It has just begun
And it will bury me
In this dusty, empty land

I'm only you and nothing more
My frozen kingdom
I adore you while you tear me down
I'll crawl to you wherever you are
I live through your hell
And I hate myself for you again
