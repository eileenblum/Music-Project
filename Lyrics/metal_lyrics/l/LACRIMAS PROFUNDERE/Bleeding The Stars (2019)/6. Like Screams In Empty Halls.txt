I shiver on these filthy floors and wait
Till a great nothing will create
Vast, mighty rooms for me again

I will scream alone
In those empty halls
And worship my echoes
They mean everything
To my dusty heart
And I will follow them

Another bitter melody in me
An ever-evolving concrete
And I don't want to be just me

I will scream alone
In those empty halls
And worship my echoes
They mean everything
To my dusty heart
And I will follow them

I shiver on these filthy floors and wait
Till a great nothing will create
Vast, mighty rooms for me again
An ever-evolving concrete

I will scream alone
In those empty halls
And worship my echoes
They mean everything
To my dusty heart
And I will follow them
