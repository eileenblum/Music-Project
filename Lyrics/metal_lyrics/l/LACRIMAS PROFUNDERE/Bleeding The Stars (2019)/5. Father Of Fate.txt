You cried for me
I did not want to hear
You fought for me
I did not understand
I never really cared

The love you gave me once
I didn't want to have
The hand you reached once
I didn't want to hold
The tears you shed for me
I didn't want to see
My father of fate
You mean nothing to me

You then left me
I did not really know
Till my bleak grief
Simply overgrown
Everything in me
