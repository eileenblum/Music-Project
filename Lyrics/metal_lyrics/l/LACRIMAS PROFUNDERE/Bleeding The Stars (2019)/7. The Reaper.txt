A lethal kiss
To claim your soul
And escape those chains of fate
The light would take
Everything from her
To dive into emptiness

Cold and burning
She found the reaper
While she fell in love
Trapped and drowning
Crowned by the river
Once she gave it all

A secret place
To drink your blood
And set this love in flames
My lips would take
Everything from her
And sink her into the grave

Cold and burning
She found the reaper
While she fell in love
Trapped and drowning
Crowned by the river
Once she gave it all

Cold and burning
She found the reaper
While she fell in love
Trapped and drowning
Crowned by the river
Once she gave it all
Cold and burning
She found the reaper
While she fell in love
Trapped and drowning
Crowned by the river
Once she gave it all
