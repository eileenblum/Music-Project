I won't scream that I deny
I won't sing that I'm alright
I won't say that you don't care
But I don't understand

I am not me
As long as I bleed myself into your empty frozen heart
And I won't wait
Another infinity for you, I learned to fall apart

I will save my last embrace
I will hope in many ways
I will never think your name
And I will be the one to blame

I am not me
As long as I bleed myself into your empty frozen heart
And I won't wait
Another infinity for you, I learned to fall apart

And I bleed myself into your empty frozen heart
And I bleed myself into your empty frozen heart

I am not me
As long as I bleed myself into your empty frozen heart
And I won't wait
Another infinity for you, I learned to fall apart
