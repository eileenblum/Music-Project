I didn't want to know
Where your sweet love flows
And I don't want to leave
This bright kingdom of my grief
I didn't understand
Why every king must end
Why all this blood must flow
And that we must leave in dust

And I sit enthroned
On my knees
And I lick my wounds
In great halls
And I wear a crown
Made of stone
Which is only there
To bow me

I will not leave my hate
Will not congregate
I'm the king of my alone
And I want me to be gone

And I sit enthroned
On my knees
And I lick my wounds
In great halls
And I wear a crown
Made of stone
Which is only there
To bow me

To bow me
To bow me
To bow me
To bow me
To bow me
To bow me
To bow me

And I sit enthroned
On my knees
And I lick my wounds
In great halls
And I wear a crown
Made of stone
Which is only there
To bow me
And I sit enthroned
On my knees
And I lick my wounds
In great halls
And I wear a crown
Made of stone
Which is only there
To bow me
