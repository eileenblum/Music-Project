We dive in those stars and leave
All our crimson emptiness
And we fall into the heart
In the centre of all tears

And we leave us
Into nowhere
And we are nothing more
Than a blind sip
Of a multiverse
Ununderstandable
But eternal

Our fears are suitable
Our blood just spillable
And our warm embrace is gone
Our old life is now done

And we leave us
Into nowhere
And we are nothing more
Than a blind sip
Of a multiverse
Ununderstandable
But eternal

And we leave us
Into nowhere
And we are nothing more
Than a blind sip
Of a multiverse
Ununderstandable
But eternal

And we leave us
Into nowhere
And we are nothing more
Than a blind sip
Of a multiverse
