I won't do that
Butâ I know you will force me to want
Foreverâ inside you
Forever alone
I feel I got caught
Butâ in the end it wasn't for

Youâ
My mother of doom
Pleaseâ eat my heart with your tears
And swallow my thoughts
'Cause I am your slave forever
My mother of doom

There'sâ no escape
When there's nothing left to decide
There's no bitter hate
'Cause there's no feeling left, no more for

You
My mother of doom
Please eat my heart with your tears
And swallow my thoughts
'Cause I am your slave forever
My mother of doom

My mother of doom
My father of fate
You swallow my thoughts
My mother of doom
My father of fate
'Cause I am your slave for

You
My mother of doom
Please eat my heart with your tears
And swallow my thoughts
'Cause I am your slave forever
My mother of doom
