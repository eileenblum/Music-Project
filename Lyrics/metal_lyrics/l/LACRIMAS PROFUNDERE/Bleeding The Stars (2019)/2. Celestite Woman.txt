It is never enough
My girl
Falling deeper in our lust
Let us die in our arms
And see
What our feelings mean to us

When we lose
We have fulfilled our purpose
When we crawl
Back to us again

And if we just deny our meaning
We could be ourselves
You're my sweet celestite woman
You will embrace my end
Let us crawl into our blindness
Let's focus on our tears
Let us fade into the dark
And hope we fail again

And we finally closed
Our hearts
Creeping deeper in our wounds
Let us dance in our dawn
And weep
No one there to bleed with us

We have tried
And we enjoyed our losses
And we built
Our own apocalypse

And if we just deny our meaning
We could be ourselves
You're my sweet celestite woman
You will embrace my end
Let us crawl into our blindness
Let's focus on our tears
Let us fade into the dark
And hope we fail again

And if we just deny our meaning
We could be ourselves

And if we just deny our meaning
We could be ourselves
You're my sweet celestite woman
You will embrace my end
Let us crawl into our blindness
Let's focus on our tears
Let us fade into the dark
And hope we fail again
