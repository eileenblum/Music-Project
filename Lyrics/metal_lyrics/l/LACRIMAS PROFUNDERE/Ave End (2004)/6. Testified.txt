And I would
Be every single tear
And I would
Be more than close or near
But I should
Be more than nothing
But I could never be you
What a sea could be
What a sea could be as deep
And I tried
To be so over-high
And I would
Be more than testified
Should it be
A life
Can you see
Light
Are you
Are you down and down
Just for you
Testified
