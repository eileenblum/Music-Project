[bonus track]

We come back
To death grace marching on
For awhile take my hand
You are, you are

Let us then
The finish time
Bad escape
Everything's over now
But the true
I'm not deface
And to lock
But how do you feel it
Death exit is
For us to fall
Vanishing
Leaving our battles behind a truth
This could be our unseen fright
Take it or leave it
I think...

You are my way, my end
You are my way, my end
You are my way, my end
You...
