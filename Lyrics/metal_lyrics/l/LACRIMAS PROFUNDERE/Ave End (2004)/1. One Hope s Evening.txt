I need you or a lightning
For no land
I would let you down
All that you were
Now is fading
Your bed's a rose or a while

I beg for you
You little hope
Being alive
For you hold on
This is your last
End to be near

The green of a serenade
Falling in love means
To blow up fate
Breaking down
For a distant life
We are alone
And I am the solitude

I beg for you
You little hope
Being alive
For you hold on
This is your last
End to be near
