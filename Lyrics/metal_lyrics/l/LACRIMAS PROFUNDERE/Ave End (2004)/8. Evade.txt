Nevermore obey
We die for what we want
Bitter pills
And everywhere
To be a lie

All is gone deliberate
Please disgrace me
Let me indicate your gap
Yes I will
From beyond and forever
Be my enemy
Never no and never you

Nail me on your walls
I spit on what you do
You would tear my emptiness
Differ and dare
You are a liar

All is gone deliberate
Please disgrace me
Let me indicate your gap
Yes I will
From beyond and forever
Be my enemy
Never no and never you
