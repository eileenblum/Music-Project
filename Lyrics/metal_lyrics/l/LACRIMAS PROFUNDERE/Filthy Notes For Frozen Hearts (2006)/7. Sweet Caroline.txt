And now
We leave us here
Our lives will break
On you
No doubts that you're the one
And there's no lie
In You
Sweet Caroline
I love you more than most
I want to hold you close
Till everything will be alright
But I feel that there is more you need
And that I have to bleed
For every little dumb mistake
But there's nothing left
For you my dear to say
Please go
Let me alone
And laugh on me
OK
Spit on me baby
Come on, come on, come on
Spit on me baby
