You are a leaf
A broken bone that heals
But you can't go away
Without to stay
Breathe myself inside
But I still wonder
That it's nothing left to leave
Learned my lesson twice
No dear hearts shall burn now
And your grief is all I need
All I need
The glue of you
Sticks on what we had
Do nothing till it ends
Don't understand
Everything's burning down
Everything's left to keep
Leave it all over me
Babe
