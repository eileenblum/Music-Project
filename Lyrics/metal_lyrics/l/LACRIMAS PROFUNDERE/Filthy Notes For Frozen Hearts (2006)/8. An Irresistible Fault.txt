Listen to me baby
I love the sweet form of your brows
And can't get
Enough of you my dear
Listen to me baby
Your lips are more than I deserve
And your kiss
Tastes better than cocaine
Listen to me baby
You you gave me all I need
And don't care about me
What we tried was meant to be
An irresistible fault
