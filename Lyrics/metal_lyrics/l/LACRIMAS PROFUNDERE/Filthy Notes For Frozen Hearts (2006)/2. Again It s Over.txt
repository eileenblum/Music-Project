Understand you can't hold my hand
Understand that senseless touch
Encourage my last little hope once more -
And I'll ignore it.

And please come over me
And do it again
You have to be sinfull
My only friend, you are
Take away all our
Bitter ends
For everything's until
We should pretend
All that we are

And please believe I won't do that for you
Please believe I know it's not true
For every word I hung on your lips
Are on your hips

And please come over me
And do it again
You have to be sinful
My only friend, you are.
Take away all our
Bitter ends
For everything's until
We should pretend
All that we are.
