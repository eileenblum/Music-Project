What I said to her:
Can't you see
That we should be
Till nothing's left to feed
Or can you betray me
Everything's out and is erased
An error in breast
Or are you
Oh no no
Nothing can be guaranteed
Please give me a chance to understand
And I would do anything
To wake up your shallow heart again
What she said to me:
Sorrowly it doesn't work
We shouldn't meet again
And I'm sure it's better
I should try to
Forget her
And I should do the same
As she did
Ha, ha, ha
