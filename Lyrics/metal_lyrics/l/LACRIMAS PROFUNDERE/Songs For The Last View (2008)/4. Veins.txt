I just swear
You will lie there to my feet
That will taste so sweet while you bleed and...

You, try to tear me out
I am in your veins
I am in your mouth
You can't get rid of me

Run away
It doesn't matter
I will stay next to you to say you're a liar and...

You, try to tear me out
I am in your veins
I am in your mouth
You can't get rid of me
