I looked at you
But I don't understand
Come close to you
And try to grab your hand
A simple touch can make me feel better
A hopeless kiss
I shatter

You, just lie in my arms
I will be there while we end
And you please try to pretend
That no one and nothing harms

We have to quit and to begin again
The same old shit
To make us whole again
A helpless smile won't change anything
We just were, and won't be...
