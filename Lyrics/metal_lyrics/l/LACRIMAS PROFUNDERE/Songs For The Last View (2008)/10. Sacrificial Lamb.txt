I live under your curse
And I live eternally damned for you
I'll do whatever I can
Just to be with you

And you take me by the hand
You lead me down like a sacrificial lamb
I'm begging you please don't bleed me like a fly in a web
Just consume me

I'll inject your lies in my veins
And I suffer in pain for you
I will do whatever I can
Living a lie with you
