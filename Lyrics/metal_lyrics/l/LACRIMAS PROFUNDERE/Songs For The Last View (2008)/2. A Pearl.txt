They, they took your breath you look
Like a hopeless mess but I be with you
Or did you think that I will go away when your blood is everywhere
No, I'm here to say

Come on lady, do it again
Be my ebony pearl and try to forget what was
Just try to forget what was
We will be together even on our knees
Swear you be forever I beg you please hold on
I'm begging you to hold on

You lie in my arms
I will try to keep you warm till then
Nothing harms
I hope that no goddess takes you away
Just wait for a short delay
And for you to say
