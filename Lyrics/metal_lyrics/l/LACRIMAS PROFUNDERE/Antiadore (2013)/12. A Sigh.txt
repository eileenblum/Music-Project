Disregard your wounds
We will get there soon
Before our hopes come tumbling down
And crash in tears
I'm sure we can escape
Before it is too late
To return to our lives and ourselves

When it's over we can walk on water
There won't be a sigh to find in our hearts
I can promise everything gets better
And can we wipe away our gloom for now

Please ignore my cries
I will stop them soon
Before I break and I give up my trials
Please be sure that I will
I will always be here
To return to your side and to your arms
