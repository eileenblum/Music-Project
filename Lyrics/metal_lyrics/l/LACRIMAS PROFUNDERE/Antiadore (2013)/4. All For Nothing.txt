The time is up
And we're almost there
The more you lie
The less I'm gonna care
Out time is up
And you should not stay
Just love yourself
There's nothing left to say

I try to belive
That it's nothing but over
Just lie to me
Now It's over for nothing

Your time is up
But I won't cry
The things we had
They seem to pass me by
