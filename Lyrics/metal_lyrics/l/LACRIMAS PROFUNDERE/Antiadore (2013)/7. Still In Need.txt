I have a need
I have a need for the things that you said
I have a need for the things you denied
But I have nothing to lose
And nothing to hide

I have a need
I have a need for the things that you said
I have a need for the tears you've cried
Oh well but I still think
At last I tried

You can love
But you can't make me love you more
You can trust
But I can't trust you anymore

I'm still in need
I'm still in need youÂ´re like the hell to live without
I'm still in need our love is over and out
oh girl, unable to choose,
unable to cry

I'm still in need
I'm still in need when I'm dreaming of you
I'm still in need when I'm feeling so blue
I'm still singing the blues
Asking you why

You can love
But you can't make me love you more
You can trust
But I can't trust you anymore

I'm still in need
I'm still in need youÂ´re like the hell to live without
I'm still in need our love is over and out
over and out
