You left me waiting here
Too fucked to shed a tear
I try to find the words to say, baby
The feelings in my head
These words must be said
To try and make it go away
And I say
I remember when
Do you remember when?

Remember when you went away
Remember when you'd say
We'll be together love forever more
Of every breath has left my lung
The saddest song was sung
When your turned 'round
And left me standing

I am getting stronger
Don't need you no longer
Now it's time to break away
Maybe I will find another
Fit to be my lover
When you're just a memory
Oh lady
