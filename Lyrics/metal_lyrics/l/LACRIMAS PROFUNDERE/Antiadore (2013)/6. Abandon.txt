Every thorn in me
Is an advantage for you
I can't go on this way
And don't want to be the same
Something you couldn't care for
Something you couldn't adore
You're turning me into a liar
I'm longing for you

And you can hate me
You can leave me
But you will be
My sweet abandon
And you can beat me down
You can throw me around
But I will be
There for you on my knees

There's nothing left to try
There's only reasons to die
Huritng and bleeding myself
I'm aching for you
