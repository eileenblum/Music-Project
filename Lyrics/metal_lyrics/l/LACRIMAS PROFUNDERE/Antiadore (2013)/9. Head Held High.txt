Look in my eyes
Together we'll make it
Leave all behind
Now that we're here
Just one more time
You're tired of giving
Just be what you are
To know what is real

Blank those lies
And keep your head held high
They don't know you at all
They don't know that you feel left alone
Dry your eyes
We're running out of time
They don't know you at all
They don't know what you felt for so long

One look in your eyes
I know what you're feeling
Out of your sight
But now we are here
Just one more time
You're tired of living
Be who you are
And say what you feel
