All these times I want to forget
And all these tears can't help me do that
And all the lessons I have learned
From you 'till now
Can't heal a thing in me or help somehow

But deep in my chest
I'm nothing
And deep in my heart
I can't feel a thing
When I'm searching through my soul
For you
When I'm digging my own hole

To bid you farewell is for me
The hardest thing I can do an agony
And in my mind you will be
Always in my arms
I can't forget your presence
Or your charms
