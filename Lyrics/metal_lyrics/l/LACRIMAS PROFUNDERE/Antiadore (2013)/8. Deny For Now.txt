One of us is now
Without a thing somehow
Help us to escape this cage
With heads hanging down
We search for a crown
Our love can't find a way
No our love can't find a way

But we can't resist
And we can't hide
From the beginning
Of our decline
As we fall apart
And try to restart
Another sad thing
We can deny for now

One of us will lose
The ability to choose
Another simple cold embrace
We try to conquer fears
But we end up in tears
Our love is a disgrace
Our love is a disgrace
