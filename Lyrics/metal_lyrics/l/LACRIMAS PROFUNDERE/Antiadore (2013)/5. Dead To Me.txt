Wait
We have nothing in common
You lied to me
Come lie to me
Caught
Down in your dungeon
No sun for me
Just lie to me

I'll swallow it all
I'm over you, I'm over you
I wiped my memory
You are dead to me
I can't figure it out
The more you'd get, the more you'd want
A wicked memory
You are dead to me

Talk
And make me listen
No love for me
Come lie to me
Leave
I'm not pretending
Throw dirt at me
And lie to me
