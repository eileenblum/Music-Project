Do you remember
When your were mine
Do you remember
Being held when you cried
I hope you still know
What I did for you
But in the end girl
I've got nothing to lose
Nothing to choose

I drink up to escape
Can't you see
I'm so drunk on my sorrows
Heat me up
I'm not afraid
I try to be what I'm not
Be what I'm not

Do you remember
The first time you lied
Do you remember
When I made it alright
I hope you still know
It was all for you
But in the end girl
You've got nothing to lose
It's your time to choose
