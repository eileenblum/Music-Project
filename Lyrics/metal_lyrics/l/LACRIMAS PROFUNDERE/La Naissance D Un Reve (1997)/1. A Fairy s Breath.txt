...and kissed the fairytale-land with pride
under the trees of lust
the leaves pure shadows on me
which shelter me from the darkness
which I was
I hold the dreams, within my arms
thrash the earth, within my tears
and heal my wounds in meadows of light
forgotten in the drowning land
now I leave my wishes
but love conquers all...
and every angel needs a tear to laugh
calling the fall
trust me, I am your lunacy
embolded, enthroned so it's a king for a while
but gloominess it sends so gentle
the gestures of the gist
ingrowing taste of dreams
infatuate my gift, now it becomes light
inexact but clear
