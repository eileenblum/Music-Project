[music &amp; lyrics Ch. Steiner]

A winter poem
Written in water
Carven in stone and sky
As marble sleep enchants
The fragile beauty
Of this wasteland's
Secret gardens
...and storm will conquer
The waning flames

Of a summer dying...

A summer's end
Another winter's dawn
A summer's end
A year of youth is lost
