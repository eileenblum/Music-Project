[music O. N. Schmid, lyrics Ch. Schmid]

Break the silence

But we left the feeling of emtiness
To discover the new doom
Of silence but

I could adore the silence more
And everything is nothing
Solicitude I never thought
I thought it was

Could escape from
My dreams
And heal my wounds

So what we become
So what we become
Is silence, heal me

I hope that we broke the silence.
