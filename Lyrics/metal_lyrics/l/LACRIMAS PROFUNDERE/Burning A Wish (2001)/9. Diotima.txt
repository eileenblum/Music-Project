[music O. N. Schmid, lyrics Ch. Schmid]

Fall away from me
My tears won't dry
So what is
You must not
Leave me

My life on you
Into your arms
I cling to
And where are
You you're a lie

Hating you
So what is you must not

For the things you do
Break me into
And all tears we weep
Will flow for you
But you're a lie
