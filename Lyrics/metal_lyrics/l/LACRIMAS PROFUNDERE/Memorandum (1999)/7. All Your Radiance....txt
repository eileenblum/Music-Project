Left, on me
but tears are a part of you
hooked, what is it
all is coming
taste it, to be foolish
on you
embrace the tears
embrace the past
for all what you are dying for
it's the only thing you can decide
o. you forget the breathes, forget
another skin, it's the piece of
unknown peaces
somehow helpless, isn't it
