...What have we done
o. to leave
fail... was I...
more to cover me
o. one
o. tear
Oblivion beneath, passion of all pity,
more than the barren tears
which your blood wept,
can't you see, there's no beloved
they're just helpless, another pale abuse
left in all...
I can't live for you
o. we can't, we hold our fault
we must die in
divinity, help me
help me, I wasn't your heaven
all you, all your tears you've once shed
