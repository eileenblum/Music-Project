I don't feel now, where I belong
I don't see how I am a live
I cannot find a place
I cannot find my place
To stay

I breath my life away
To make you wanna say
Believe me, believe me
I breath my life in ways
That I don't mind
If you're okay
Believe me, believe me

I am here now, searching for life
I don't care hoe, your love is gone
A million steps to stay
A million miles away
From me
