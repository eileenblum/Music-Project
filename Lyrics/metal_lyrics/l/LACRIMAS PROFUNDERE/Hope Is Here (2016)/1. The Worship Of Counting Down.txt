Goodbye
Little world, little you
Goodbye...
Disappointing you
Goodbye falling down, keep replaying in my head
Your amber flames, burning in my ache

Goodbye
Little world, little truth
Goodbye never trusting you
Goodbye melody that everything will never change
Not looking back, lost and on track

You and I we're free
When nothing - is all we have
When I needed scars

You and I we're free
When nothing - is all we know
Blank infinity
The worship of counting down

Goodbye
Little dream of us tow
Goodbye
When I think of you
Goodbye to your eyes - their smile - locked inside my head
Day after day
You burn it away

Goodbye
Little world, little you
Goodbye...
Disappointing you
Goodbye falling down, keep replaying in my head
Day after day
I burn it away
