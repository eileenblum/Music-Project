I'm your little fellow
And lazy today
Let god out a window
Ash golden deceit
Day in, day out
On repeat

It's so fascinating
Our fake parade
The need to know
It's all the same

I feel myself is withering today
I need love more than anything
To get back on my way
And my reflection is really my best friend
I keep myself in shape to die more in the end

I chew my newspaper
Vicious everyday
Grow grass that's greener
I want to marry me
We all, will have
Our way to die

It's suffocating
By the air that I breath
With pride I smile
Through pearly teeth
