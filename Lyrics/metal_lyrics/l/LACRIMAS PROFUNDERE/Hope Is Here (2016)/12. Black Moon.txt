I heard you're flying
With me my dear,
With you my dear
Sunlight is shining
Most everywhere

Seems you world is dying
I burn for you
I'll burn with you
Sometime I am hiding
Your everything

Why did you beak you promises
And try to run from me
I die if I would not have you
In my atmosphere

I'll sign you-to sleep
I'm on your way
You're in my way
Black moon I see you fighting
For anything

Without me you have nothing
Slow down your life
Slowed down for life
I can see you drowning
In my blue everything
