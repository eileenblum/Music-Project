Years I go I said
Goodbye to the south where we met
The warmth that we both had
I can't find you there

You don't understand
That we aren't here
Our direction is yet not there
And follow your stars
To the cold, black north
This is where we belong
For now

No bloody east, no west
Can limit what is best
The love that we once had
I will find it there

And follow your stars
To the cold black north
