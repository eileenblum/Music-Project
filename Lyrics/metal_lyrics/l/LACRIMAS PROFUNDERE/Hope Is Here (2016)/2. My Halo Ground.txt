Breath -
I cannot see clear what I have now
Seek -
For disconnected meaning in my life
Where can I find meaning?

Is the rain drowning me?
I see circles -
My halo ground

Is the flood freezing me?
I feel paralyzed
Charged for nothing

Sleep
To withdraw the fear I'm carrying 'Ground
Love
This self â constructed being
A self â constructed being

Where can I find meaning?
Where can I find?
Where can I find meaning?
Where can I ?
