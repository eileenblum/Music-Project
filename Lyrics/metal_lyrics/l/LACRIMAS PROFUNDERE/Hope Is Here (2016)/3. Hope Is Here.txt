I'm
Just a moment in time
Yesterday in black, tomorrow is blind
Could I start dreaming again?
It make me understand
How you can flay

Hope is here
Hope is here
Our hope is here
Hope is ....

You
Are you slave to your self
In a war of today
That turns wrong in the end
I feel like freedom is mine
And the past is consigned
I close my eyes

Could I start dreaming again?
Could I start dreaming?
