I am high on my own
I will stay here forever
Watching days come and go
Ding things "just because"
There's nothing I'm scared of

With a head full of nothing
I have something to say
When the time-creep is not
Standing still
With a head full of dreaming
I don't care what they say
You don't want me to leave?
I stay awake

Look at all of my nothings
Everything feels so new
It's just you and your shelter
I could see quit a future
Nothing's - damn new
