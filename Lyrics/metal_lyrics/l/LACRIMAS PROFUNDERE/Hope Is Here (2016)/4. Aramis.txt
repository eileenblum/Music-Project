Laying awake to find
My â lost piece of mind
And let it go
I let it go
You're running wild
While I'm loosing time
And let it run
Run run run

I've handled the world
And now I â now I'm old
That is all I wanna do
I've handled the world
You know I â want you to get old
That is all I want for you

When will you find
Your peace of mind?
Need to let it bleed
The warning signs
You left behind
My dusk your dawn
You're on your own
