Here I am
As old as you
Here I am
As good as new
Never alone
Lighthouse of pain
Here I am
Far away

Only child
Where child is found
Our home, our home
Where's the light that save our lives?
Roots alone
Guide us home

Here I am
Without a home
Here I am
A carved out soul
Always alone
When I fall
Here I am
After all
