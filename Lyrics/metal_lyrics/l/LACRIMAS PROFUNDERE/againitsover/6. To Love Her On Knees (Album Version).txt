What I said to her:
Can't you see
That we should be
Till nothing's left to feed
Or can you
Betray me
Everything's out
And is erased
An error in breast
Or are you
Oh no no
Nothing can be guaranteed
Please give me a chance to understand
And I would do anything to wake up your shallow heart again
What she answered:
Sorrowly
It doesn't work
We shouldn't meet again
And I'm sure
It's better
I should try to
Forget her
And I should do the same
As she did
Ha, ha, ha
