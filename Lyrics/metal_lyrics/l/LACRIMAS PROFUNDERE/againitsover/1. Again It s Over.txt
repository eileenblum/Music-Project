Understand you can't hold my hand
Understand that senseless
Touch
Encourage my last little hope once more
And I'm
Ignored
And please come over me
And do it again
You have to be sinful
My only friend
You are
Take away all our
Bitter Ends
For everything's until
We should pretend
O, that we
Are
And please believe I won't do that for you
Please believe I know
It's not true
For every word I hung on your lips
Or on
Your hips
...We should pretend
