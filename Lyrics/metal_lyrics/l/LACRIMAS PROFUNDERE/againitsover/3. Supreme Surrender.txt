Please let me be and I would do everything to
To let me in your pillar-heart again
It sounds perverted but it's true
Without you
I give you all but you want more
Sad believe
To every little shallow thing
I agreed
So throw away what we once had
And give up
It's a supreme surrender
Without your tears it is over for me baby
You could save it all but you say maybe
Go on
And leave
It all
It won't be told again
A face in the crowd
