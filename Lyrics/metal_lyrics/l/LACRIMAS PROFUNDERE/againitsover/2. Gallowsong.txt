It's my gallow, oh
And it's yours
And we can't swallow enough of
And every little thing we had to do
Fell in our throat and dies into
There's nothing to be found and nothing to go through
We had our glasses and thought
They were true
Please believe me bitch
It can't go on
And we can't do it one more time
