Broken love fills every part
of my body to late
we've found the knifes in our hearts
let me out, let me out
from a cage called love
so called love?

I would die for you
but now I die for my depression
I haven't no longer to live
because I lost the key to the door of
your lovely mind
the blooming harmony is dispersed
but myself is dispersed too

I feel like a fallen leave
withered in a lost love

I'm longing to dive into the sea
of tranquillity and drown
in it to feel what I never felt
before... freedom

(the expectantly sleep)

o. depent which agony
melt in nothing
but the beauty lives on

autumn morning
cold, dark, foggy
autumn morning
commit suicide in
autumn morning

autumn morning
I laugh loud
autumn morning
because I will never remember this
wonderful time
autumn morning

cause I am dead
I feel like a fallen leave
withered in a lost love
I'm longing to dive into the sea
of tranquillity and drown
in it to feel what I never felt
before... freedom

(the expectantly sleep)

I am dead
