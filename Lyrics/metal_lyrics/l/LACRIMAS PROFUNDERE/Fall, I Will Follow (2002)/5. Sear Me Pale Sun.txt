cover me
fall cover me
fall cover my heart
sear me pale sun
sear me pale sun light
my bleak heartand says
wont get better
by the shivering of your breath
cover me
fall cover me
fall cover my heart
sear me fale sun
sear me pale sun light
my bleak heart
it cant be that in ends
for no one
feels like this
