What is evening
What is "to let me fall"
What is to "to shed a tear"
With every breath
you will sail
so try to touch
my ocean
so this is sailing
but who can now hold on
and that is to run with fear
your ship will be nothing
in every heaven
and now you see
that you cantbe
any thing or nothing everthing
you are a lie
you are a lie to me
