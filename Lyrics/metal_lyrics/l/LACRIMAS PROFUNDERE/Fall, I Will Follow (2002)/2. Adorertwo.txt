I gave it up and
It ends
When youth collide in me
I got it
Dont wash your tears in me
I gave it up for you
Being nothing
But,I cant do that
I need no one or no lives so everthing will be nothing
I cant ease your burden
I need no one or just any life
It's all in me be my every
When thist shit`s over
you will cry a tear soon
Its over and you cant stop it
