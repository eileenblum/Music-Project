Its you and high
I cry for
our time
- time -
I love your tears falling down and no heart should go on
your hair is like winme
your skin
"h"
- time -
I love your tears falling down to kiss our love goodbye
so pour me out and burn me down
I be with you and when
It all ends my soul ends to
I fall for you my tears
will  belong to all
your times and to cloudy touch for every breath my heart beats with
I cant be me
for me
Its a feeling a nevertrust a thought
can you give up
and drown back just never forgive up
please drown
I never fornever you
