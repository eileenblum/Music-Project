Help me sort my anger
You decide which battles to fight

You're my helper
You're my keeper
There's a thin line 
You must never ever cross
When you get there
I will tell you
Not to treat where you do not belong

You do not cross my path
Or you will face my wrath
Do not belittle me
Or I will crush your cranium
There is no diagnosis deep enough to cover what is wrong with me

Come show me the side of your truth
The bitterness makes me blind
Lead me towards my inner self
To see what's hidden inside

Sentiment
What's my story
Sentiment
Where's my glory

Great divide
The canyon between us all
So deep inside
It's rooted inside our soul

Now and then and forever
In our hearts
In our hearts
In our hearts

Gimme shelter
Gimme weapons
Gimme all your money
And your soul as well

I will keep you
I will kill you
I will torture you beyond what's possible

You opened up the door
To evil uncontrolled
So little you can do to stop this flood of violent art

My brother save yourself
From this malevolence
To analyze this shit is far beyond your capacity

Come show me the side of your truth
The bitterness makes me blind
Lead me towards my inner self
To see what's hidden inside

Sentiment
What's my story
Sentiment
Where's my glory

Great divide
The canyon between us all
So deep inside
It's rooted inside our soul

Now and then and forever
In our hearts
In our hearts
In our hearts

End this sentiment
All the work will make it worth it
End this sentiment
No collapse will ever be worth it
