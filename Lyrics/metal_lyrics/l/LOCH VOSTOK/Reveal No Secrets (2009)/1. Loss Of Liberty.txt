Dropped off in the middle of nowhere
Can't remember when I last cried
Loss of liberty enhances sensitivity
I feel manipulated now

So cold I cannot feel the hunger
My strife was taken away
It's strange, this weird sensation
Like I've been raped of my truth.

I was deprived of what used to be mine
Now I am left here alone

Do you remember me?
I was your friend
Do you remember me?
I was your twin

Dropped off in the middle of nowhere
Disoriented, fragile and numb
I can't remember anything
All I know is that I'm cold

I feel so manipulated
Like someone's been messing with my head
Here I go into my mind
To try to find out what was mine

I was deprived of what used to be mine
Now I am left here alone

Do you remember me?
I was your friend
Do you remember me?
I was your twin
