International conflict
This constant lie of lies affects us all
Proven beyond doubt
The clown distorts the truth, to suit his ideals
But some of us can see
Propaganda machine
Which network shows what's real, and what's the deal
After any war
There are no winning teams, just broken dreams
But some of us can see
Through all the make believe
Estranging you and me

War!
Going out to war
This means war

No more peace signs
No more hippie shit
Led by convictions
Stronger than steel

Prisoners of war
It's really you and me, watching the TV screen
Missing in action
A mass of balderdash, insults your intellect
But some of us can see
Open your eyes
Don't let your prejudice affect your view
Cause some of us can see
We took our blindfolds off
And saw parents cry, their children killed for what?

We took our blindfolds off

War!
Going out to war

No more peace signs
No more hippie shit
Led by convictions
Stronger than steel
