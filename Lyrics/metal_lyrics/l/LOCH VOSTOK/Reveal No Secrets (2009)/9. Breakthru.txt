Another year flew by me
Another silent night
So far from being sane
Hidden in amnesia

Seeing bits and pieces
Recognising some of them
But to get the big picture
I have to dig deep within

Within my heart
Deep in my soul
There is a void

Finding the key
Opening the lock
What will I find

Deep within my heart
I know, I know
Somewhere deep inside
I know, I know

The mere sight of you
Makes my heart pound harder
To assume I loved you
Is an understatement

The feelings are still here
It's the first thing I feel
Haven't felt this sure about
Anything in at least a year

My hear my soul
Every cell
Remembers you

Some things do last
Some things are past
Let's start anew
