On my voyage on an ocean of lies
The man killed the boy inside
Wading knee deep through the greed infested mud
Where lies become truth and truth becomes tales

What you see is not what it seems
I won't give up I'm setting sails
I'm still sure that truth prevails

We're on a trip towards our false fate
A social system built on hate
The family tree and circle of old
Got our lives in a chokehold

Never ever stay, go away
Never ever stay
Don't you stay too long, or you become me...

I wanna be your truthteller for a day
To control clear channel and say what I am
Storytellers feeding you by force
The sanctionedtruth is the main course

Secret play at the top of the nation
Born into a mass indoctrination
Medication through the media nation

Never ever stay, go away
Never ever stay
Don't you stay too long, or you become me...

Do the free really need to hide?
Reassurements of the constitution
"Our way of life kept safe from the world outside"
You inherit the prison of truth untold
You stay here inside 'til you're old

Take a good look around
On what you think is true
Would you sacrifice it all
To dig deeper?
