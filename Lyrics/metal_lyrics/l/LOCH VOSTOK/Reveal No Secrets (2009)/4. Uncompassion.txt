Follow your logic, don't follow your pride
Pride has destroyed so many lives
"I will not apologise, I wasn't wrong"
But two wrongs don't make me right, only what's left.

Hello, hello
I know you
Hello, hello
I am you
Instincts, feelings, gut wrenching stories
Sorrow, sadness, helplessness

Somehow you welcome the dark life approach
Misguided bastards the prodigal son
Embracing the sadness like it was a drug
Depraved of your will to forgive and forget

Hello, hello
I know you
Hello, hello
I am you
Instincts, feelings, gut wrenching stories
Sorrow, sadness, helplessness
