In the hour of death
We talk about life
Isn't it strange we tend to wait til the end

We unravel the past
And withhold our pain
While we really should be talking fear

Fear of death
A thing so natural yet we act like it's taboo
Fear of death
You got to open up your mind

So taboo
Even in death you still speak
So taboo
Shut the fuck up when you're dead
So taboo
Back to be pure energy

Our life was so good
Everyone knew how much I loved you
Everything laid to waste today

It's so dark in here
Can't wait til I get out
The other side of grief seems far away

Smell of death
I guess you left the shell that used to be you
Scent of death
I got to open up the doors to the sun

So taboo
Even in death you still speak
So taboo
Shut the fuck up when you're dead
So taboo
Back to be pure energy

And I know it's true
Yeah I know it's true

Yeah I know, when I die, back to pure energy
