Wading through waves of blood
Pummelling the faces that haunt me
In my dreams, as I try to run
Thicker than blood stinking like vomit

Dragging me downwards, into the deep
Counting the seconds and minutes
For years and years, I've had these dreams
Killing my sleep, fucking up my days

Cannot keep a job
Cannot keep a friend
Have to self medicate

Starting at the ceiling
Wondering what would have been
Without the haunting
Could it have been any different?

Same shit different night
Puddles of sweat in my bed
Chased by the monster again
It's getting weirder every day

Cannot stay alive
Cannot keep on going
Have to self medicate

Starting at the ceiling...

Chasing the rush everyday
Searching that high, high and low
Chasing the rush everyday
Raiders of the lost heart

Starting at the ceiling...
Chasing the rush everyday...
