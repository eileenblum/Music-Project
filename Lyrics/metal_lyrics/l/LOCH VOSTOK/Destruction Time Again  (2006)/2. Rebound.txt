In an insane world
Lives a girl
Wanna save her soul now

Why do I bother?
Why do I care?
Can't even save my own life

So delusional
In my own world
I shut myself in

Living on the edge
Pain is more than skin deep
Your helping hand cuts deeper than the blade

"Intimidation doesn't work
Try a mild approach at first"
Guess you've tried them all before

But I, I feel your pain
I tried again
I can't help myself
Systematic backslider
