Now it's time for me to go through hell
Speak the truth, now will I live to tell?
Just a fleshwound, keep repeating mistakes
Like an escapee on a treadmill

Going nowhere

Fuck the truth don't want to understand
Why I turned out this way, can't comprehend
Little misfit never understood
One in a million but all the same

Going nowhere
I am still here
When I fade away I'm
Going nowhere
Nowhere

Follow no one beat your own damn path
Can you dig it stupid do the math
Here's your life now go and spend it
Don't succumb to mass conformity

Going nowhere
I am still here
When I fade away I'm
Going nowhere
Nowhere
