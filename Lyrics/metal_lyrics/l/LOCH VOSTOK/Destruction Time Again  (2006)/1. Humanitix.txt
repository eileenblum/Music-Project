Species die and species are born
It's in the nature of the game

Soon homo sapiens will be extinct
And I don't really care
We, humanity, are only here to rape
And ravage what was given to us

We're ticks, leeches and scavengers
We are scum

We are so redundant
And soon, we're gone

We have no natural enemies
So we turned on our own
Oil or soil, money, crops, religion
Fight for any little reason

We're ticks, leeches and scavengers
We are scum

We are so redundant
And soon, we're gone

The great barrier reef will never rebuild
It's past grandeur again
Tourism erodes, then kills itself
Too bad they raped it first
