It's time to focus now give up all other plans
You gotta plan ahead cause it's gonna take a while
Pollute the hell outta it
The earth, sea and sky
It's gonna be so pretty
To watch this planet die

We are soldiers
Of a greater purpose

It's time to rape the earth
And burn this fucking town
I've got my sunglasses on
Let's torch, twist and distort
Goddammit I look good
And the scent of gasoline
Is casting a glamorous gleam
On this weird but beautiful scene

We are soldiers
Of a greater purpose

Burn, burn this town
And I'm beautiful
Yes I'm beautiful
Scorch, scorch the earth
And I'm beautiful
Yes I'm beautiful

You talk and talk and talk and say it's gotta stop...
Well I've got new for you, it's never gonna stop
And then you cry and plan tomorrows change
Then tomorrow comes to wash those plans away

Oh god you hate yourself
For what you haven't done
Far too lame to try
To build a new world

Burn, burn this town
And I'm beautiful
Yes I'm beautiful
Scorch, scorch the earth
And I'm beautiful
Yes I'm beautiful
