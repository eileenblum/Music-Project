Here today I'll express my thoughts
My last will and testament
I am sane though you'll think I'm not
Just read on and embrace my words

No detour, no return
Willingly I'm set to burn
Rather rule in worlds below
Than to serve the cunts upstairs

Take my soul
True Deceiver
Burn my flesh
True Deceiver
Give my brain to research
True Deceiver

My dear son you shall have the house
All the cars and the fucking yacht
My dear daughter take my cash
Check the cayman island account

You my wife, you took my heart
Now I'll give it back to you
Put it in a jar of glass
Forever you'll my heart possess
