From the wailing in a gospel choir
To the massacre in Jonestown
Across the street in a sunday school
They march on his name

Justify the murder of millions
In the name of a lie
Justify the control of billions
Oppression style

Trying
To find a way out of
Dying
There is no way out
You can't win
Still you march on in his path

In the name of anything except
In the name of the human race

Evolution took a halt
When they started to walk in his footsteps
Evolution took a halt
'Til the day we trust ourselves
