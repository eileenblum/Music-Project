Senseless and deaf to the world
I am nowhere, somewhere
Limbonic soulless and scarred
Let me smell the clean air
Nothing in me was worthwhile
I was dead and dreaming
Call me my name and I will
Soon destroy your life

Autumn comes to deprive
You of your lust for life
Autumn lord set the sun

Turn the tide
Suicide
True Kevorkian style

Now that I am so old
And my time has come
Will you hold my hand
As I lie in bed
I wanna say so many things
But I don't have the strength to speak
I wanna say I'm sorry
For all the wrongs I've done

Autumn comes to deprive
You of your lust for life
Autumn lord set the sun

Turn the tide
Suicide
True Kevorkian style
