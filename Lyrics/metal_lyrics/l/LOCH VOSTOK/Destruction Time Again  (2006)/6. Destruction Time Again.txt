Climbing a step too high
Falling so hard

Moving a step too close
Not sensing your fear

I can't feel, your personal sphere
I've never known ho to behave
Our time i sup

One victim at a time
Couldn't sense what
Others felt

I will never be part of
Your little game
It's Destruction Time Again

I didn't know, your personal fears
I'll never know your inner self
I limited our time on this earth
