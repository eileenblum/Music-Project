I wanna be your partner
I wanna be your friend
You never let me in to
Your own little world

You wanna be so secret
It's only for the show
Tear down your silly barriers
And let me know

How much more should I try
How much more will it take
How much more punishment
Can I tolerate

In your world lives a little girl
Who is longing for a life
For a life

I wanna kill your character
I want the real you
Fuck that fucking roleplay
And fuck your medicine

Schizophrenic alter egos
You hide behind your diagnosis
You think you have the sole right
To depression and despair

How much more should I try
How much more will it take
How much more punishment
Can I tolerate

If you only let her out

In your world lives a little girl
Who is longing for a life
If you only let her out
Symbiosis - You and I
