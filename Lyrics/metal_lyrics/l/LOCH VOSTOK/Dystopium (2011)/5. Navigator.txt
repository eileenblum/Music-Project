Beaten to the floor
Bereaved of everything i am,
A void was opened here tonight 
Stripped beyond repair Naked for the worldï»¿ to see 
Relentless atmosphere, twisting, turning inside me 
I'm screaming from the top of my lungs: "Why am I here?" 
Lead the way forï»¿ me 
Show me where to go 
Light the path for me Navigator 
Find another way, 
I'll listen to what you say 
Rescue me from this
Take me somewhere else 
Ready to cave in, give in, be free from sin
Lead the way forï»¿ me 
Show me where to go 
Light the path for me Navigator
