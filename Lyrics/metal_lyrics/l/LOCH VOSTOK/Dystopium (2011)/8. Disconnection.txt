I saved that could be saved
There is no second chance
For all these little things, like love, hate and desire
My lust for life owns death no afterlife

Like thunder my engine roars
My heart is strong
Like lightning my presence strikes
For you I long

Behold this blacktooth grin
So fierce, evil and grim
Sentimental moments that tear your heart apart
The time to heal is now, or never

Like thunder my engine roars
My heart is strong
Like lightning my presence strikes
For you I long

Reconnect your senses
And disconnect your soul
To be one
With the earth, sea and sky

Reconnect your senses
And disconnect your soul
To be one
With the earth, now let's fly

They called it "the war that turned boys into men"
As if wars ever did any good
But it only turned boys into wrecks
Now there's no way out

They fucked with your mind and then fucked with the truth
Like they always did
Then denied you the right to repair
Now there's no way back.... To your home, this is your home

The enemy are animals, we've got "God" on our side
Remember you once had a choice
Now there's no way out
