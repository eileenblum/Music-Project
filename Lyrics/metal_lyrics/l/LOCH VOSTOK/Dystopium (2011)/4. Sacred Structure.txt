Time for revolution
Time to strike them down
Denying evolution
Was their last mistake

Many of us has had it
With all their fake ideals
Risky superstition
The hazardous belief

The nation stands divided
So hard to understand
Science flabbergasted
It's so retarded

Intellectuals baffled
How low can you go
When all the proof points elsewhere
Idiots persist

Divinity, dividing nations
Congretations, holy wars
They are on in their delusions
Sacred structure, in their minds

Darwin had the answer
Many years ago
Scientific explanation
To many mysteries

Capitalistic sermon
A hollywood belief
Money over wisdom
On wall street they kneel

So naive, unenlightened
You should be frightened of them all
