I found the answer, and a remedy
To find closure I must climb the fence
I have to tear down the walls I've build within
Separate the fake ideals from what's real

All understanding us humans claim to have
Still we fight about whose god is greatest of them all
Take all your symbols and throw them in the trash
Take all your inner strenght and believe

Two hands working does more good than
A thousand clasped in prayer

I believe in you
You believe in anything but
I believe in you
You believe in anything but except yourself

All of this worship did no one any good
We should have worked instead, to make this planet great
Such huge potential, but all the systems failed
'Cos you were siting there praying into the void
