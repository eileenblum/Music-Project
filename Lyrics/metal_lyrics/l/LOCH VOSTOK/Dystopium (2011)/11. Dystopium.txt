Sentenced to this city noise
Pretended like I had a choice
Sometimes I just feel like letting go
Go beyond the stars
Joining all what once was
Sometimes I just feel like leaving
All of you behind

'Cos I know you, I'm just gonna run
You're lurking in the shadows, I'm just gonna run, run
Far away from you and all your sins

Rampage, hell is here on Earth
Cities failed to keep us warm
All that we have come to know as truth
Is indeed all lies
Join us in our sacred fight
You and I will stand together
Both of us against you all

'Cos I know you, I'm just gonna run
You're lurking in the shadows, I'm just gonna run, run
Far away from you and all your sins

You and I against it all
We are forever interwined
Soul collapsed and hearts in two
The pulse is weaker beat by beat
Drop by drop
Pulse
