You follow the herd like a sheep in wolf's clothing
You actually think you do good
But you're only feeding the rich
Now there's no way back.... To your home, this is your home

Only one thing will turn boys into men
Mutual respect, unconditional love
Trust them to make their onw decisions
And if they fail, you guide the way
Only one thing will turn boys into men
Mutual respect, unconditional love

Never send your sons to war, the risk is too damn high
They'll be lost forever more
Then there's no way out
Give your children all of you, never put them aside
There is nothing more important
Show them, guide their way home... This is their home
