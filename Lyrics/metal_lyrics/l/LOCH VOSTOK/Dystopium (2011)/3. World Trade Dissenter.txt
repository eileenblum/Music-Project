Free trade of what? Human lives
Globalization just fucked your wife
As the world turns another year
Into more was and more fear

Robber of every norm, I wonder 'til my feet bleed
Senses depraved, will I awake?
Slavery is back, the big corporations
Playing with our lives for profits so great
The the world can't see that we all feel like waste

Some day when people realize
That slavery's back, corporate style
I really hope we all fight back
Stop using world track smack

Vote with as bullet seems fair these days
All the parties run the same old race
No visionaries or souls of fire
Just accountants and suits for hire

There's nothing you can do
Lower wages for you
As the world turns another year
Into more was and more fear
