So convinced and so convincing
Missionary on a mission
To convince you of "gods" greatness
But he falls short
Science triumphant

And on the first day I know
Man created "god"
A bible in hand
Repeat offender
Disguised as doing good

Le me show you
The true left path
Into science
And evolution
Who needs more laws
Then those voted for the only "good book"
Is the one by Darwin

And on the first day I know
Man created "god"
A bible in hand
Repeat offender
Disguised as doing good
