Lately, i've been feeling kinda sick
i don't know where it comes from
but i know i feel like shit

Banksters (BASTARDS, backstabbers)
i'm a victim of ascam
a mass experiment
perhaps a possible genocide
...LIES...

Collapse beneath the weight
the magnitude of it all
where are the answer
heed my call

Look beyond the obvious
it's just a fake wall
all done with smoke and mirrors

Oh my god, they dropped the bomb
even through they new the outcome
limitless greed, a need to feed the pigs
misantropia

And i don't even know
we must believe in something
can't doubt it all at once
[SERIOUSLY, there has to be something]
and i don't even know
we must believe in something
something to be true

Fuck me, we're so incredibly fucked
but we must spread the world now
let's put the bastards behing bards
...LIES...

Trascended beyond lies
rise above it all
dare to expose it, don't be scared
make them pay
their lwyers working overtime
to protect the product
there is no such thing
as the perfect crime
they will be scrutinized
heed my call

Look beyond the obvious
it's just a fake wall
all done with smoke and mirrors

And i don't even know
we must believe in something
can't doubt it all at once
[SERIOUSLY, there has to be something]
and i don't even know
we must believe in something
something to be true
