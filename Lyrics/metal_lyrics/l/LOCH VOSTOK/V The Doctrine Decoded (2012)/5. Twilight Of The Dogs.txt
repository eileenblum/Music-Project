...AND here's your recession
the one you voted for
the chosen few decides again

You're bent to submission
they use their power to
secure their right to hold you down

It all might seem so damn impossible
so fucking hard to comprehend
the greed for power roots itself so deep
that they'll do anything to stay in pleace

...BUT i know it's...

Time for changes
Twilight of the dogs

This extreme obsession
it's getting out of hand
we are the ones who grooms the tree

Or bring the depression
no progress in this world
endless regression if we dont

Assassinate the so called government
ending the kleptocratic reign
and violation of the common man will finally come to a grinding halt

...SO you know it's...

Time for changes
Twilight of the dogs

Hold that thought
[THERE'S always a possibility that they're listening]
Hold that thought
[THERE'S always a possibility that they're listening]

And all this nations inventories
they have been robbed from our land
and our forefathers built this nation
with their sweat and blood
and now them bastards don't give a damn

Hold that thought
[THERE'S always a possibility that they're listening]
[THERE'S always a possibility that they're listening]

Time for changes
Twilight of the dogs
