A day to make your stand
a day for streched out hands
togheter they will hear us marching
the protest will be heard
come join our legion now

It's our duty now
to spread the message loud
we must securize this region
de-politicise, take the weapons out of their hands

Decentralise the power
destabilize the horde
control the inner circle
destroy the very core
equalize the barriers
that all of us has to climb
assassinate the hinderers
revolutionize

From chaos we were born
the spawn of families torn
to pieces by the ones we trusted in
there is no future, if we do not change the course
i've made a promise now
i've chosen a different path
to never vote again
until we reached our goal
the government overthrown

Decentralise the power
destabilize the horde
control the inner circle
destroy the very core
equalize the barriers
that all of us has to climb
assassinate the hinderers
revolutionize

Chaos - Inflict chaos
Chaos - Inflict chaos

Decentralise the power
destabilize the horde
control the inner circle
destroy the very core
equalize the barriers
that all of us has to climb
assassinate the hinderers
revolutionize

Chaos - Inflict chaos
Chaos - Inflict chaos
