Hope ha sleft you, no big deal
no damn serenades, no lit de parade
you're a guinea pig, in a gring wheel
social indifference, made it flee

But somewhere near
a ghost keeps haunting you
it keeps on asking you:
What did you gain?

Gnawing feeling, deep inside
Calling on you to find, strenght and power
to let go, of the comfort cell
before the last spark, is dead and gone

But you would never
through you seem clever
you do not have the guts to try and find
i have no answers
but you must questions
the whole agenda or they will prevail

All the obstacles, cluttering your mind
makes it harder, for hope to be found
for far too many years, you've been searching
for what once was lost, inside yourself

No solution, unless your effort
becomes altruistic, for the good of mankind
you must break them, take them out
leave yesterdays behind, but remember tomorrow
