Today and tomorrow in a land far away
there were two kings and they were showing off their blades
one had a long one and behold, it was sharp
the other had a blessed one and it was told to have unearthly powers

King number one used his sword to control
king number two collected taxes from the poor
both gave their power and money to the banks
the money lenders returned the favor

No more will i ignore
all the signs
all the words
all the people telling me goodbye
desperate people make desperate choices
can't hear myself thru all the noise
inside my head

The kings were now puppets
and banksters pulled the strings
inflated the rates and controlled the news
invaded the innocent while the guilty cut deals
the two kings content inside their alabaster mansions

No more will i ignore
all the signs
all the words
all the people telling me goodbye
desperate people make desperate choices
can't hear myself thru all the noise
inside my head

I wish this tale had a happy ending
i wish it wasn't true
and dammit i wish, it was in a land far away
