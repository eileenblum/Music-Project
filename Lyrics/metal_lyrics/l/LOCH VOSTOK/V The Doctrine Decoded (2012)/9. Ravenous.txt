"I have come to save you"
said the leader out loud
there is something going on
you can change it
if you open your eyes

The poison have worked
it has had its effect
the venom has spread
across the world

And as i see corruption
intoxicate their minds
the cure eludes us all
through hidden in plain sight

Comfort has replaced all wisdom
and all the souls of fire are gone
we're all just chasing the bliss
while the master robs us blind

We're tricked to look the other way
and focus on this weeks celebrity collapse
the once so secret doctrine has opened up wide

"I have come to save you"
such a blatant lie
they call us the "TIN foil hats"
the only ones with open eyes

The poison have worked
