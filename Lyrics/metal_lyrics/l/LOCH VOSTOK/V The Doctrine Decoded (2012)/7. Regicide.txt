I have achieved
all i ever wanted
i have recieved
money and control
i will use it
to make me great
i never cared
about you

You think you count
you think you matter
you think you have a say
about what's going on
but let me be
the first to tell you
the top twenty
already made theit picks

It's your lose
you fear the power
the bastards are in control
it should be the other way around
kill your darling, kill the kings!

You think you know the parties
but they are long forgotten
kill the bastards, leave them out to rot
at the network vulture buffet

You have achieved
nothing in the long run
unless you do something drastic
there is no meaning
in the following the herd
be a leader, a force to be reckoned with

It's your lose
you fear the power
the bastards are in control
it should be the other way around
kill your darling, kill the kings!

You think you know the parties
but they are long forgotten
kill the bastards, leave them out to rot
at the network vulture buffet
