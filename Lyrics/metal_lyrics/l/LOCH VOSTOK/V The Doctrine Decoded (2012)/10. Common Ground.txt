This is not new to me
i am always on the run
this is nothing
not compared to where i come from

There is place i've heard about
where we share common ground
sentimental tacticals
forbidden to ignore

Never say never again
you'll be ignored
cry wolf cry wolf cry wolf
your name be stigma
Never say never again
you'll be ignored
cry wolf cry wolf cry wolf
your name be stigma

You are one identity
but they want to erase it
colonize the inner self
and reprogram all that you are

The bankesters of the mega plan
the spawn of your catharsis
now escape your own demise
to where we share common ground

Never say never again
you'll be ignored
cry wolf cry wolf cry wolf
your name be stigma
Never say never again
you'll be ignored
cry wolf cry wolf cry wolf
your name be stigma

I have faith in you
i hope you do too
trust your instinct now

Never say never again
you'll be ignored
cry wolf cry wolf cry wolf
your name be stigma
Never say never again
you'll be ignored
cry wolf cry wolf cry wolf
your name be stigma
