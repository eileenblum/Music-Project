I sense a new path is calling my name
internal struggles have led me this way to enlightenment

Catch twentytwo and the threehundredtwentytwo
all play a part in this journey to hell and then back again

Poisons the minds of the used and abused
insanity triumphs the innocent victims of greed and fraud

Treated like shit til you can't take no more
punish, replentish the trhone of the whore of the power gore

No more will their rules apply to this world
i'll make sure they flee like the rats they are

Now, follow this path, try to ignore all of their wishful promise
there are no genies in this world

Unabombing everything in sight
we will never ever stop this fight
claim the trhone of the power core

Threaten my life and i'll show you my nightmare
pissing all over my hopes and my dreams gets you front row tickets

Surprise, surprise, here is your gift
suck on this pipe momb make Teddy a happy and cheerful boy

Unabombing everything in sight
we will never ever stop this fight
claim the trhone of the power core
