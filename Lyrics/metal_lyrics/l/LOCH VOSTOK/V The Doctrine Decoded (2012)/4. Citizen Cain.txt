Empathy is done
loyalty is lost
symphaty is gone
where are you?
i need you

Cash and huge withdrawals
overpowers all
former men of god
even they gave up prayer

But they lead you here to this atmosphere
they seem so sincere
they hide in sheeps clothing

"SOON our father comes to collect
the chosen righteous ones
the chosen ones"

You believe there will be armageddon
but your god is a fraud
the moneymasters alias
only here to hide the truth
you believe there will be armageddon
but money masters everything

Pissing on our dreams
raping our faith in humanity
killing all that we fought for

All the prophets aretools of mind control
this and that is sin
they want you to believe in

"SOON our father comes to collect
the chosen righteous ones
the chosen ones"

You believe there will be armageddon
but your god is a fraud
the moneymasters alias
only here to hide the truth
you believe there will be armageddon
but money masters everything

Empathy is done
loyalty is lost
symphaty is gone
where are you?
i need you
Empathy is done
loyalty is lost
symphaty is gone
where are you?
i need you
i need you
