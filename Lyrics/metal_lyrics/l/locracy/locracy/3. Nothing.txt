No time left, no way to choose
No responsibility, nothing left to loose

Nothing â¦. Individualizes you at this point
Nothing â¦. Will be different for this good boy

This is the end....
My eyes descry no more
Just black behind
Behind the dying mass
One thought, one life
Just a thousand crippled minds
Are begging now
For their forgiveness

All that we're hoping for
The sky above us seems to rupture
And nothing will be left 
...no more
Look up to the fragile sky 
It turns from blue to gray
And nothing... and nothing will be left..... no more

I donât want to die, I want to live forever
I want to lay down all my useless shame

Heartless â¦ is how I see the end
Careless â¦ no honorations
Shameless â¦ shall be my recapitulation
Senseless â¦ was my life
I want to fight rules which are bigger than my whole existence 
Just to get a second chance 

Nothing â¦. Individualizes you at this point
Nothing â¦. Will be different for this good boy

This is the last time I,
I take my last breath and,
Those endless words are 
Shiftless prayers to our gods

Itâs pain inside
Inside our troubled minds
Excuse me there's no way back,
I'll stay forever blind.

Disappointed,
Of the way I chose to live my life
I built a cage around my mind
Of wrong morality

The imprisoning, painful kind,
That makes you feel so incapable,
To follow your free will,
Which leads you to satisfaction

There is nothing more to say
No last wishes
Just one chance for everyone
And mine is gone now

Dying's not the bad part,
It's the looking back,
All this wrong choices
Haunt me for eternity
