Let me introduce myself
My name doesnât matter
My age is more of interest
Cause Iâve been here for a long time

At the dawn of mankind
I was born in a cave
I saw too much for one life
And now I stand in my grave

Long way mankind has come
I went through all its shit
Not much was worth seeing
Suicide is what Iâll commit

Eternal life, a fucking curse
Endless circles no improvement
Same stories, same mistakes,
Crushed hopes and disappointment.

I decided to end my life
To choose the only way out
Of this endless boredom
Cause there is no change in sight

My life was a straight way
I was â¦ histories slave
I end it with no pride
One line â¦ from cave to grave

I know ... this world ... its past ... and its future

I bowed in front of many tyrants
I fought in many wars
I thought I could change the future
But no change did last long

I watched much development
I saw some great inventions
I supported big rebellions
But circulation was to strong

Religions were no guidelines
I saw them rise and fall
Different names but the same subjects
Restriction and suppression

I didnât see any miracles
No magic, no god
All I saw was violence
Destruction and corruption

Eternal life, a fucking curse
Endless circles no improvement
Same stories, same mistakes,
Crushed hopes and disappointment.

I decided to end my life
To choose the only way out
Of this endless boredom
Cause there is no change in sight â¦ (in Pause)

My life was a straight way
I was â¦ histories slave
I end it with no pride
One line â¦ from cave to grave
