Let me tell you a little story
About a mommy and her son
She always looked down on him
But listen how itâs going on.

He always sneaked out at night down the hill to the road of fast death
Looking for the flesh he enjoyed as much as nothing else 
Smashed animals ripped apart on the on the bloody, red asphalt
His weapons were his knife and fork, his fellowship were lust and hunger

When he had his midnight dinner one night in the full moons shine
Naked, crushing bones with his jaw and licking up the blood from the ground
Down the hill came his mother and screamed, she could not believe what she had found
Over and over she shouted at him an then she told him not to eat road kill

Those shouts where always there when he sneaked down to his road of pleasure
He couldnât enjoy his meals anymore and so he felt even more obscure
His passion, his identity, his mommy didnât support them
He felt like ripped apart between love and hate, he felt like a problem

But tears where filling his eyes every time he chewed these victims of speed
Knowing that he was wrong but still he had to satisfy his need 

Donât eat â¦. Road Kill
Donât eat â¦. Road Kill
 â¦but it tastes like heaven.
Donât eat â¦. Road Kill
Donât eat â¦. Road Kill
But it tastes like â¦

â¦ Heaven!

One night he found the biggest meal he ever had on this road 
It took him till the morning to finish all the flesh and bones
He nearly couldnât get back up the hill to his home
But when he did he realized his mommy has gone missing
Fear filled his eyes âcause he recognized the hair he picked out 
Of his meal that was too big to be an animal

3 days when hunger drove him down the hill again
And he chose his big last supper
He was caught in two shining eyes of a car
And then there was darkness
