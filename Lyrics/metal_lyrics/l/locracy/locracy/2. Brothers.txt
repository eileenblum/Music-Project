This is a tale of two brothers

What nature has brought together
Politics shall not separate
One and a half brain
For two humans is not enough

Two sides of a medal
That is consisting of shit
Doesnât matter which one you choose
To hate strangers or to legalize it
1.5 Heads for two bodies
.75 bald, the rest with long hair
Life in struggle for every minute
Siamese dream has gone unfair

Acceptance for everything
Isnât a way to go through life
Hatred on race projected
Will never get a chance to rise

Two brothers, two opinions
None is right none is wrong
Race war or flower power
Tight mind is never strong
.5 part brain is missing
No chance for neutrality
Separation is impossible
Enjoy natureâs brutality

The constant fight is so exhausting
The opponents canât keep it up
So they unite to change the situation
Chainsaw is the tool to put a â¦.

â¦. Stooooop â¦. Toooooo â¦ thiiiiis â¦ groteeeesque â¦
Stop this grotesque!

Their life â¦ Shall change
Their hope â¦ Is separation
They lay â¦ It in 
The hands â¦ Of a chainsaw â¦â¦â¦

The chainsaw rips their heads apart
Just like they expected
With opened skulls they run around
To find the groups their minds selected
But blood loss was to immanent
They both fall onto the ground
They wake up in a hospital
Stitched back together

And so the fight goes on
Forever
