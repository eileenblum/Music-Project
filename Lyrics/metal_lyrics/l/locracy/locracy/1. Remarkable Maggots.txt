You think you're ridin' on the crest of a wave
Lookin' down on remarkable maggots
Take their lives, make them sad
Make the whole world your fools
A never-ever-ending reign of repression
All you need, all you want, is an exalting heed
Are you mad, are you sad, if someone don't like you?
I know your motherfucking fear
- to make a fool of your surpassing person
I know about your awesome secret nightmares 
- of standin' alone in a hall of stoicism
Your life? You think it's outstanding?
Smash the mirror just to see what's all behind it....
One shout, one threatening vista
And your condemnable self-confidence will fall!!!!!!
What do you know about this life?
When will you learn to realize...
You're not the focus of this earth
But just a wimpy shade of (a) nerd
What do you think to know about this life?
When will you finally realize...
You're not the focus of this world
But just a wimpy shade of (a) turd
Your life ..... is nothing to me....
And it ain't gonna be, so listen to me
My friend....come...take another ride
To the other side just one last fight
Before... before you forget,
What you've ever been - whatever you've seen
Take a look... while watching your face
When you pray to your god at the end of your days
These words.... you've always preached
I will never believe i will never forgive
They are...  engraved on your tomb?
Well no!
Goodbye... once I......
I looked up to the sky
And I ...I saw your name....
Now you're dead ... and I'll do it again
I thought I was ridin' on the crest of a wave
And my wish had finally become true
Lookinâ up - lookin' down - no-one here - no-one there 
Think about - all these fools - make me sick 'n' make me swear
Looks like a never-ending instance 
A never-ever-ending reign of repression ... remains
