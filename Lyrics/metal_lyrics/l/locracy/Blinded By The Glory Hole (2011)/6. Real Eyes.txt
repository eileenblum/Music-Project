Known by several billion minds
Ignored by as much of them
Faith covers the fear
Prayer its strongest outbreaks

I donât want to tell you the truth âcause I know you already got it
In your darkest moments you realize the meaning of your existence

Truth needs to be accepted
Like the end up front
Hope shall be motivation
Take action donât just respond

Dig, dig, dig into your Mind
Find, and look beyond what made you blind

Realize! â¦ Beside the Dream
â¦
Realize! â¦ Faith has no answers 
You! â¦ Are in charge of your life
Look! â¦ At the facts surrounding your
World! â¦ It is a cruel one
Flesh! â¦ Is your true name and
Nutrition! â¦ Your only purpose
Spirit! â¦ Is just straight survival
Soul! â¦ A fucking fairytale

Rise from your knees
Show some ambition
To be more than nutrition
You can break the chain

I tell all those impaired faggot,
Get back down, stay on the ground
Your blood will too stop flowing
There's no power to a corpses crown

Choking on an unknown fear
Ignorance will cause backfire
Broken your life disappears
Disappointments your last feeling

Career, another misunderstanding
Achievements, worth no manâs life
Time, thrown out of the window
No confidence, just pretending

Your suits not covering balls, you hide behind it from the fear
The tie reveals the low life spirit; you will not get it till the end is near

Truth needs to be accepted
Like the end up front
Hope shall be motivation
Take action donât just respond

Dig, dig, dig into your Mind
Find, and look beyond what made you blind

Realize! â¦ Beside the Dream
â¦
Realize! â¦ Faith has no answers 
You! â¦ Are in charge of your life
Look! â¦ At the facts surrounding your
World! â¦ It is a cruel one
Flesh! â¦ Is your true name and
Nutrition! â¦ Your only purpose
Spirit! â¦ Is just straight survival
Soul! â¦ A fucking fairytale
