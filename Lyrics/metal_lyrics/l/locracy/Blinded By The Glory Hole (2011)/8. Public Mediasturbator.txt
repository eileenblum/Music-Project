Here Iâm sitting watching TV
Heaving a fun time â¦ with my wee-wee.
Because of you the news are getting sexy
Theyâre information â¦ and self-penetration
I think thereâs violence in your kitchen
Your lips are so full â¦ theyâd give a BJ with no friction
The microphone is looking like my penis
Trembling around your lips â¦ filling your face with my jizz

Your airtime is my heroin
And masturbation is my needle
You talk about some child starvation
I apply the lubrication
You say last week an airplane crashed
An explosion happens in my pants
I feel my â self
Drow â ning in this
Mess I sum â moned
With my Pe â nis
â¦

For months we had a perfect relation
But now I crave to come some
More, I need the perfect erection

More ... More â¦ More ... More

Forty screens and eighty tits is what I found
In the mall where I go to â¦ satisfy my
Lust, I canât control it anymore 
My penis is red tits around my head â¦ tit tornado
My consciousness is leaving me 
Ecstatic shivers bend my knees â¦ Iâm seizing
Still rubbing Iâm gonna hit the floor so hard
Butt-naked theyâre gonna find me â¦ masturbating 

â¦

Now Iâm sitting in a jail cell
With no TV â no play for my wee-wee
Arrested for public masturbation
I miss the media â and the news from your station

But then you show up at the prison
To interview the pervert soul
I canât believe itâs happening to
Me I think Iâll lose control
But when I saw you in live action
I see the flaws below your waist
Your fat thighs and
Your short legs are
Turning me of my
Addiction
