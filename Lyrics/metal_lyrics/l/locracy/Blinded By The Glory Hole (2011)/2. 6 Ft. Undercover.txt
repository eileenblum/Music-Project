Corpse dug up, all holes molested
Dead flesh in vein, Necrophiliac on the loose
The fifteenth time, Graveyards a mess
Cops resignate, the graveyard sees more action than a whorehouse
How to catch, a corpse lover, you need a bait
Hot cadaver, our hero jumps in to save the day

This hero is no clever one, a village idiot more or less
His mental strength is by far succeeded by his motivation to rise and shine
Dress-up to look like a corpse
Get buried, thatâs not insane
A trap so wrong it could work
Well that just sounds like a plan

The idiot in the coffin lurks, the air decline not in mind, heâs slowly passing out â heâs passing out
Trapped in his trap, a death so unnoticed and full of irony â full of irony
Free but sore he wakes, he lost his virginity to his rescuer â to his savior

Life is so disturbing as we crave for appreciation the loudest Ego-
centrics rule the center of attention which creates small minded
Zombies with constant craving for a piece of recognition for a
Fake and shallow happiness in the spotlight of disgust

6 ft. Undercover, 6 ft. Undercover, 6 ft. Undercover

His loneliness is what he fights by searching for a bigger self, more acceptance and a little pride
Desperation is fueling is aspirations and his battle for his little chance to rise

New try the same routine, an idiot in the coffin slowly passing out â slowly passing out.
Stuffed from behind, he wakes up because someoneâs pounding hard â someoneâs pounding hard
Hole weak but glad, he caught the villain heâs gonna be a hero now - a hero now
Itâs a sexy bait, one gaze and he finds himself in love â oh so in love

[Chorus]

Fame is just a fuckinâ empty â¦. Shell!

A choice was made he loved the bait aspirations gone for the sake of romance
Who wants to be a lonely hero just to read their name in the paper
Fifteen minutes of fame wonât last as long as a lifetime of happiness
Attention whores go down so fast after a life of misery

Necrophiliac never caught
The one who stopped him unknown
Graveyard back in his best shape
A suspicious couple takes a walk and smiles about the old times
When the friends were foes
Now they live happy ever after
Beyond the public they rose
