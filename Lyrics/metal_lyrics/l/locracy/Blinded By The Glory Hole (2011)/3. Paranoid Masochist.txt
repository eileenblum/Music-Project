I feel it rise, shivering
Feelings so wrong, sickening
A crazy swirl, I canât bear
Against my will, Iâm going blank
Pain is my lust, masochist
Constant fear, paranoid
Frequent arousal, inhumane
My life turns into constant shame

They call me mental patient
Inmate is what I call myself
A prison made of pills and needles

Fear of an attack makes me freeze but
When I think of pain my lust turns me into fire
Enduring switch between fear and arousal is
Melting my mind into a cadaver
Freak is what society calls me but
Itâs my nature I canât separate it from my mind
A cruel way to manufacture a human being and
To deny its feelings and needs

But deep inside â¦ Iâm still crazy
Suppressing meds â¦ just changed my shell
Nature is boiling â¦ in my core
Itâs gonna explode â¦ for its revenge
Imprisoned needs â¦ tend to enlarge
Denied freedom â¦ leads to rage

I break the cage of Medication
I use my rage to free my mind as
I run free I realize my destiny
I break up with society
For my own insanity, my need for isolation

Nature is coming for me
Acceptance makes me free
No fear and no restraints
This is my only chance

Pride - Gone nature kicked me out of
My Life Now Iâm lonely and Hor-ny
Fear-full Iâm afraid for
My-self my needs will never be Ful-filled â¦ A
Spi â ral into insanity is
My â life medication shall be the cure
Now I turn into a
Zom â bie no feelings and No joy

I feel it rise, shivering
Feelings so wrong, sickening
A crazy swirl, I canât bear
Against my will, Iâm going blank

Fear of an attack makes me freeze but
When I think of pain my lust turns me into fire
Enduring switch between fear and arousal is
Melting my mind into a useless cadaver
Freak is what society calls me but
Itâs my nature; I canât separate it from my mind
A cruel way to manufacture a human being and
To deny its feelings and needs

Pride - Gone nature kicked me out of
My Life Now Iâm lonely and Hor-ny
Fear-full Iâm afraid for
My-self my needs will never be Ful-filled â¦ A
Spi â ral into insanity is
My â life medication shall be the cure
Now I turn into a
Zom â bie no feelings and no joy
