I prevent myself from ever existing

Now it finally arrived
The day I shall spawn to this
Life, I have never chosen.
This world is no place for my mind, 
Itâs an awful cage for the freedom 
I am longing for
I refuse to waste my potential
On this screwed up hellhole
You call a modern society

My final choice
Prevent my existence
My hate shall be a hammer
Crushing my own persistence

My only fear is failure in my attempt to prevent my existence and my
Frightened heart shall stop when I celebrate the end of my beginning and when
I turn into a stillborn there will be a smile on my corpse âcause I succeeded in what
I craved for so ultimately itâs my precious auto-abortion 
This suffering will be a 
Bless compared to 
Living a lifetime
In this mess.

Your world is what i avoid
My death is my salvation
My life is all but sacred
My birth would be my damnation

Suffocation for me â¦ itâs what I want, I rip
Off my umbilical cord â¦ put it around my neck, it
Works like a hanged manâs tie â¦ I gasp so happily, I
Travel the birth canal â¦ the cord is holding me, attached
To the pancreas â¦which is my anchor;  my sight
Turns into bright white â¦ this is my final gasp, as I
Enter your world â¦ itâs just another corps with my
Self-satisfied smile â¦ on that blue swollen head

My only fear was failure in my attempt to prevent my existence and my
Frightened heart has stop when i celebrated the end of my beginning and when
I turned into a stillborn there will was a smile on my corpse cause i succeeded in what
I craved for so ultimately it was my precious auto-abortion 
This suffering has been a bless 
Compared to living a lifetime
In this fucking mess.

You wonât get to know me better!
