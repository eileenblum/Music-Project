Hello you people
Itâs us your leaders
The ones youâve chosen
And now you feed us
Weâre not the smartest
Not even too close
Our biggest part is
Trick you unto needing us

Once weâre high above you
Weâll never back down again
The power you handed us
Weâll use it to fuck with you
Eating from your plates
Disgracing your daughters as whores
Youâre still gonna kiss our asses
Or weâll let you hit the floor

Your vote counts but just for us
Your voice is heard and ignored instantly
Democracy is what gave you the opportunity
To choose between whoever we offer you to bow down for
This system we came up with lets you
Think you have the power to change the stuff
Weâre loading on your backs and shove in your face
The truth is your blind sheep directed by assholes

We let you down every time you rely on us
Weâre growing fatter while you are left to starve
We take the credits for what you achieved
Weâre the spoiled rapists of society

We treat you like little kids
We tell you fairytales
Lying straight to your face
About how weâre saving you
Moneyâs the only influence
We truly react to
Where we prostitute ourselves
Let go of our common sense

Roll out the red carpet
Weâve come to look down on you
Jerk off our ego
Selfish we march over you

Your vote counts but just for us
Your voice is heard and ignored instantly
Democracy is what gave you the opportunity
To choose between whoever we offer you to bow down for
This system we came up with lets you
Think that you have the power to change the stuff
Weâre loading on your backs and shove in your face
The truth is your blind sheep directed by assholes

Our power comes from your stupidity an your subordination to the system
Embarrassing how you accept what we feed you and the shame we put you through

You suffer, but we don't care
We don't fucking care
