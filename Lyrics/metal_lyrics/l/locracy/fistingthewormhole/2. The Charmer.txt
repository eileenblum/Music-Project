All things are falling apart
The mask falls, reveals your face
You hid; you thought itâs so smart
Gone is the respect and gone is the grace
Clinging to shallow believes
Far from a decent attempt
The dirt is your place

The human mating ritual reduced to a parade of colorful 
Assholes waving their glittering dicks for more attention
Thereâs no ethics
In pretending
Its distortion
A giftwrapped turd of lies  

You should get your wallet now itâs mandatory
Get a ring or write a check, to put love in the air
Pretending to be a prince, a peacock of a man
Resenting all honesty and drown in bimbo panties

Thereâs nothing in here worth to aspire
I feel no need to play this game, âcause my aim is so much higher
What a rotten path this went down, deranged clowns banging plastic ladies
A theater of broken dignity, a zoo of horny apes aching from mental buttfuckrabies

You donât seem to like it
I know I hate you for
Acting like the douche 
You should not mimic

Liar, Coward, shut up, fuck off

Your ways â should not bloom â you should not succeed â I think â you have done â enough damage now.
Fearful â I see you â raping honesty â and I â feel like I - should take revenge.
Right Now!

I 
See where you got your ideas from but 
Itâs no excuse for your condem-
nation of basic human inter-
action I say all of you cunts have to die
Itâs
Wrong all the damn rom-com bullshit and
Sad how you summon my eternal disdain

Youâre to blame itâs such a shame I curse your name just end this game
Leave my sight or I will fight I know Iâm right you fail at life
No excuse for your abuse of every truth you disapprove to
Youâre to blame itâs such a shame I curse your name just end this game
Leave my sight or I will fight I know Iâm right you fail at life
No excuse for your abuse of every truth you disapprove to

Thereâs nothing in here worth to aspire
I feel no need to play this game, âcause my aim is so much higher
What a rotten path this went down, deranged clowns banging plastic ladies
A theater of broken dignity, a zoo of horny apes aching from 
Mental buttfuckrabies how can you live with this
Self-degradation escalation, raised through self-righteous ego masturbation

Your ways shall not succeed; you shall not plant your seed
Iâll turn away from this, thereâs nothing I will miss
The card house collapse to arrive will immanently crush your life
