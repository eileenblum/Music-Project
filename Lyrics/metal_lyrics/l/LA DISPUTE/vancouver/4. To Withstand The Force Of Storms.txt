oh, you've a pretty mouth, 
leave your lips to linger on my skin and 
kiss me one last time 
i will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter 
sleeping in the sutures of the city's skin 
make yourself remember me in cold and concrete. 

when will you realize this city/your demons make(s) you real 

oh, you've a pretty mouth, 
leave your lips to linger on my skin and 
kiss me one last time 
i will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter 
sleeping in the sutures of the city's skin 
make yourself remember me in cold and concrete. 
it's the way my hands felt lying still beneath your dress 

(i am transparent, 
i am a greenhouse filled with ghosts.) 

oh god, oh dear god 

whisper secrets, speak in a hushed voice 
the first thing that you learn is that you never let them hear you 
in a soundproof room, in a windowless world 
keep your voice down or dull your words. 
then, 
put on your bedroom face for him, 
all pursed lips and half-closed eyes with pink-stained skin 
screaming for sleeping hands on downed dresses, 
screaming 
for dead legs come alive, for dead legs come alive. 

oh dear god, there is no excuse for me
