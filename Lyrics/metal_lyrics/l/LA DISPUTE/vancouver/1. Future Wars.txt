(Crows, wipe the blood from the end of your claws. 
Said the vulture
Lets gather like storms for the war. 
Crows, as the night turns its skin into coal, 
Dark as corpses but cluttered with gold. 
They will label you thieves, wolves, and whores 
but you are nothing less than angels, 
cast down and covered in black.) 

Ain't this the bloodiest mess in the world? Said the virgin, a torn little girl. 
Boy, you went and made a sweet wreck of my soul, and I've already forgiven you. 

And blood was running down 
Her dress in streams into her hands where she 
Was stitching on the flesh had left 
In sections on the carpet near a bed that 
Never slept while she was sleeping 
In her clothes that he had laid with on 
The floor with all his fingers crossed 
In hoping that that distance 
Wouldn't grow. 
But how it grew, 
And how it hurt, 
And how it hallowed every memory had 
Never felt was threatened by a thing the world 
Could conjure up to kill them, but he let it kill them 
What a bunch of fools we lovers are. 
And now shes smiling, with her self put back together, 
just a shadow of the past before the war. 
All sewn together, like a city sick from storms 
and sick of waiting for a god to call the floods out of her home. 
what a bunch of fools we lovers are 
when tempted by the taste of flesh. 

"My boy, you are nothing more than a thief and a whore 
in a suit of the finest of armor." laughed the vulture. 
"Pathetic little child, I am embarrassed for you."
