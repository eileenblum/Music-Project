Everybody wants a reason for everything.
Itâs so much easier with someone or something to blame.

Iâve always struggled at the root of the problem.
Has it been absence or my constant lack of defense?

Iâve never spent a lot on finding a remedy.
I guess I figured that it hurt for a reason.
I guess thatâs why Iâve always turned to writing it down.
Not just in stories, but the letters in between.
And I guess thatâs why it haunts the pages of everything-
to self-examine.

I think the thing is that I shut off from everything.
From friends and family and my own ambitions.
From having fun.
I just shut off from everything.

Self-defeating? Yeah, probably.
But I donât know that I had total control over it.
And Iâm not sure it even matters why.

Sometimes things happen and you canât do anything.
Plus, Iâm the only one who deals with it anyway.
So if everyone could do me a favor and
just put their fingers down
Iâd-and keep your mouths-

Sorry. I know I seem angry.
Iâm not, Iâ¦I promise. I just know I did this to me.
And I will deal with it accordingly.

And I donât need opinions from those never a part of it.
Donât need them pointing out my problems, theyâre mine.
Donât need reminders, I know better than anyone.

And yeah, I know, I should be finding another way.
I know that I should be out seeking a substitute.
But just forgetting never really made sense to me.

So I havenât been.

Do I feel embarrassed about it?
I think you know the answer to that.
I think youâd probably feel a little bit embarrassed for me,
wouldnât you?

I know I shouldâve moved on ages ago, been happy already,
but itâs never been that easy for me.
Or maybe it was me that made it so hard.

I know Iâve only ever tried a handful of times
to sever this thing torturing me.
It never got me anywhere, with anyone.
No friendship or hobby, no loverâs bed worked.

But looking back I maybe never tried hard enough,
and it is my fault.

Maybe I never tried at all
