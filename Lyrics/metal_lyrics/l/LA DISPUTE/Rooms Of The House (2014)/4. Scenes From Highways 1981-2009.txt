I let the car drift some
Eye your uncomfortable pose in profile
The postures of long drives
That endless cycling of your numb and near sleeping parts

And you lean much harder than you need when the road curves
Swerve through traffic and the cracks in the ground
Every gesture you require of a drive like this night
When you fight now you just head out of town

I let the wheel go over center lines
Inside a place without time, a loop through history
Eye you in periphery now prone in the passenger seat
Itâs a mystery the ways you can sleep

I want to leave here for where nobody goes
I want to breathe in the air of all those sprawling ancient spaces on earth
You said weâre so scared of alone and I knew what you meant
You want to go where it glows all those places where your watch doesnât work

You were riding those nights on the highway always hiding out inside a songwriterâs dream there
Like a scene from a song, âBorn to Run,â or maybe âRunning on Emptyâ
Ones where they would leave

Certain nights when youâd fight you couldnât stick around
So youâd head out of town
Just hit the highway and drive
Certain nights when youâd fight it was fine
But it shook you when the baby would cry

Why did you always turn around in the end?
To hear the shattering of glass on the door again?
So loud the baby couldnât sleep anymore?
What didnât you find that you were looking for?

Your mother called a hardware
Set you up an interview
An answer to an ad
The bossesâ daughter still remembers dinner where her father said
He wouldnât stick his neck out for trouble again
But they did then
And those days youâd wake up and just decide you wouldnât show
Heâd show up at your door
Nights youâd skip town
Heâd follow you out
Pretty soon you started falling for their daughter
And she fell for you

Drive roll every window down
Let the desert enter heavy and primitive in
Drift till rumble strips sound
Time moves so slow but I know that you meant what you said
You want to go where itâs frozen
All those places where the highways donât reach

You want to go where it glows
Somewhere that time is irrelevant
You want to go where it glows
Somewhere the spaces are infinite

You want to go where it glows
Somewhere you donât feel the hours pass by
You identified the flowers on the road
I rolled the windows down and shut off the radio

Did you ever think youâd end up here
All those late nights you spent driving alone?
You were riding to hide or you were looking for a brand new life
Did you ever think youâd find one back home?

Did you even think youâd get out alive?
Could you imagine then the love you now know?

I think historyâs a system of roads and thereâs nowhere it doesnât go

I pulled over to the side and felt no time
Off the highway with the landscape aglow
Still not sure what we were trying to find
I only know we went home
