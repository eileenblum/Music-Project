It was many and many a year ago,

In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In that princedom by the sea.
But we loved with a love that was
more than just love,
With a love even the seraphs up in heaven covet.

And that was the reason that long ago,
In that princedom asleep by the sea,
That a wind shut her body in a sepulcher, 
Buried in the sea,
That bore my sweet darling away from me.

Oh, the angels they envied us-envied our love.
Yes, that was the reason the wind came out,
Stirred the air and made the waves shake madly,
Killing my Annabel Lee. Oh my Annabel Lee.

Our love it was strong. So strong
That neither the angels up in heaven 
Nor the demons in the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the
Soul of my Annabel Lee.
