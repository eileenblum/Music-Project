Walked into find you sitting in your kitchen, softly singing,
âSomeone carry me away.â

If thereâs always someone leaving. 
Will we ever stop believing that the winter fits us perfectly?
Isnât someone always coming? 
Once the summers up and running
Wonât you feel warm with me?

But weâre so tired of when we donât make mistakes
But things get torn away.
And weâre so scared of losing faith
That we canât put things back together when they break.

Walked into find you staring out the window at a city
Holding memories of older times and howâd sheâd gone away.
And we sang through smoke and rum and coke and 
Promised with our pity, man, one day, I swear weâll be ok.

Walked into find you sitting in your kitchen, softly singing,
âSomeone carry me away.â
