It was out on the highway.
It was warmer than blood. 
It was spaces and basements. 
Faces brimming with love.
It was nightfall to daybreak.
Finding a new way 
It was falling asleep at the wheel while awake.
It was wasting away; delay the promise of heartache,
It was tracing the chest to the arm to the hand
Thatâs been wielding a knife and trying
To cut our dreams in pieces but weâll be fine.

I feel alright, tonight.
Yeah, I feel alright tonight.

I feel (I feel alright) [4x]

It was fear of foreclosure, stock in General Motors, 
It was boarding up buildings, burnt; the tortured and war-torn. 
It was unpaid rent checks and 
All the hope left,
The hearts that still beat through the bones in our chests.

I feel alright, tonight.
I guess I feel alright tonight.

I feel like letting go (I feel)
I feel like letting go (Alright)
I feel like letting go (Tonight)
I feel like letting go, yeah.

I feel like giving in (I feel)
I feel like giving in (Alright)
I feel like giving in (Tonight)
I feel like giving in, yeah.

Thereâs a chorus of voices below you,
Thereâs a prayer of hope composed in song,
In a basement with the lights turned low and
Thereâs room to sing along, so sing along.

And I feel alright, tonight.
Yeah, I feel alright tonight.

I feel (I feel alright) [4x]
