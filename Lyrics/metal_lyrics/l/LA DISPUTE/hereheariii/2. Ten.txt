I promised Colin Iâd keep writing, and
Thatâs the only promise Iâve kept, but
I have no regrets. Like,
Your empty mailbox?
It doesnât bother me.
Not at all.

And I promised you Iâd come visit soon.
Guess I shouldâve made the trip, but
Moneyâs tight as rope and time too. And
You know how it goes better than anyone.
There isnât ever much of anything we need or
Think we do.
So I donât feel bad.
I donât feel bad.

And somewhere you cut me out.
Fall in love to rinse your mouth,
But it doesnât bother me at all.

I promised Colin Iâd take off to you soon, on
An old deck in Louisville, KY.
Four stories up, Six AM and Ten deep
While they weâre sleeping, and I said, 
âKeep me in check, friend.â And he tried.
But I couldnât be.

And that small window closed, and I
Never really kept writing either, just
Stared downward at the page most times or 
Thought about it real hard.
And there must be something missing in me
That sheâs there and Iâm still here because
Thatâs messed up.
But I donât feel bad about it.

And somewhere you cut me out.
Fall in love to rinse your mouth,
But it doesnât bother me at all.

I have tried hard to stay hopeful in the moments
They cut ropes to set you free.
I have always tried to point the finger elsewhere.
This time it points to me.

But it doesnât bother me at all.

Each chance to lock arms, to lie long in locked eyes
And I failed to let go, to cut ties with my life.
But Iâm torn, and reborn, see I died when you left.
But each word since that day was your name from my chest.

I am afraid.
But it doesnât bother me at all.
