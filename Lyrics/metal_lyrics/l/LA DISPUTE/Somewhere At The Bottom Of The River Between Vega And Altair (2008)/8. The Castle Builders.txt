Now speak of anger, 
forget all the fears you've kept about love and sex and death and faith, 
erased, or swinging sweet from around her neck and between her breasts. 
Let every lonely body finally break its fear of flesh and say,
"How strange it must've been back when we shook at the sight of sweat."
Let our worries wander out of like water streaming from a spring,
and sing of all the things our heads have failed to ruin yet. 
There's so much they have failed to ruin yet. 
Bright as lightning, loud as thunder, 
We'll move all the hurt aside to let love sustain our passions, 
And move up and onward. 
We are not our losses, we are only the extent to which we love.
So build a home for your family, and build a castle for your friends. 
Now set their beds with sheets and blanketÃ£, keep them safe until the end. 
I've felt the damage and burn from the fallout. 
My love failed but theirs prevailed. 
My friends, I'm only flesh and bone, 
but I won't let you die alone.
So leave our hearts at the foot of the mountain. 
Let our burdens be locked in the stone. 
If you will help me roll it upward, 
I won't let you die alone.
I see a beauty springing upward from the earth and from out our hearts. 
For all the bad that seems to plague us, I swear to you there's good. 
They say that death is not a problem, it's a promise, 
I can only say for sure that when it makes your bed I'll kiss your head "Goodnight."
So speak of all the love we lost, and what it cost us, 
Left us beg our breath to stop but we kept on and 
We were strong. We stayed bright as lightning, 
we sang loud as thunder, we moved ever forward. 
We are not our failures. We are love.
