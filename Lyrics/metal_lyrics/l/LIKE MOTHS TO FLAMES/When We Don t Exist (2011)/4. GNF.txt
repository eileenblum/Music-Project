[feat. Danny Leal of Upon A Burning Body]How did it come to this?
A bitter taste is all Iâm left with
Iâm losing all of my patience

How did it come to this?
If Iâm so wrong
Will you just let me know?
So I can move on and go

I just canât bring myself
To care about you
Youâre somebody else now
Iâll make it through to live another day
Donât tell me Iâm wrong
You donât know what you have âtil itâs gone

I donât give a fuck
About the way youâre feeling
Your mind is dead and empty
Thereâs nothing I can do
Who will you be when the world gives up on you?

Who will you be when the world gives up on you?

And when thereâs no one else to turn to
Donât say I didnât warn you

How did it come to this?
A bitter taste is all Iâm left with
Iâm losing all of my patience

How did it come to this?
If Iâm so wrong
Will you just let me know?
So I can move on and go

I just canât bring myself
To care about you
Youâre somebody else now
Iâll make it through to live another day
Donât tell me Iâm wrong
You donât know what you have âtil itâs gone

You donât know what you have âtil itâs gone

I donât give a fuck
About the way youâre feeling
Your mind is dead and empty
Thereâs nothing I can do
Who will you be when the world gives up on you?

I donât give a fuck
