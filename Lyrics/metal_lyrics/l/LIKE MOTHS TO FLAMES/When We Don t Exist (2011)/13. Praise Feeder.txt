So please help me cause I can't believe
Won't you help me cause I don't believe in this world

Lost my way back
It's safe to say I had this coming
Lost myself again
I've been searching but found nothing

Can't make me whole again
No matter what you try
You can't wash away my sins
Still feeling worthless
without something to give me purpose

How will I find my way out of this?
Why did I do this to myself again
They said the water would wash away all my sins

I never believe them
They can't escape from the changing seasons
Too numb to know what I've been feeling
Don't preach at me like I need your healing

Lost my way back
It's safe to say I had this coming
Lost myself again
I've been searching but found nothing
I can't find the truth in the lies
No matter how hard I try
So please help me cause I can't believe
Won't you help me cause I don't believe in this world

Can't make me new again
No matter what you think
I've given up on everything
Still feeling worthless
without something to give me purpose

Giving up on myself has never looked so inviting
Giving up on myself has never looked so inviting

How will I find my way out of this?
Why did I do this to myself again
They said the water would wash away all my sins

Lost my way back
It's safe to say I had this coming
Lost myself again
I've been searching but found nothing
I cant find the truth in the lies
No matter how hard I try
So please help me cause I can't believe
Won't you help me cause I don't believe in this world

They said the water would wash away all my sins
I never believe them
