Your dreams, they slowly fade.
So uncommitted and it's such a waste.
You're left alone and afraid.
Now just confine your problems,
and figure out your own way to solve them.

I'm not sorry.

I'm not sorry for all the things I've said,
Go fuck yourself if you can't handle it.

Don't act like you're the one who's innocent.
Have you still learned nothing from this?
When will you face your shameful actions?

Don't act like you're the one that's better off.
I know that you planned this
To just let go it didn't matter the cost.

I'll never need the things you're offering.
You turned your back on me,
it's such a shame to see.

When we believed we all could live out our dreams,
we all stood up for something.
Now that you're left with nothing,
don't act like you're better off.
Cold conscious slowly fading,
you can't get back what you've lost.

Your conscious is slowly fading away,
go face the path you've paved.

I watched your dreams die,
they fell in front of your eyes.
Watch your dreams die,
they fell in front of your eyes.

I'll never need the things you're offering.
You turned your back on me,
it's such a shame to see.

When we believed we all could live out our dreams,
we all stood up for something.
Now that you're left with nothing,
don't act like you're better off.
Cold conscious slowly fading,
you can't get back what you've lost.

Cold conscious slowly fading,
cold conscious slowly fading.
You can't get back what you've lost.
