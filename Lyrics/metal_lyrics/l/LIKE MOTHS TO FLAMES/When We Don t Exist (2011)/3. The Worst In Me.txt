How can you live with your life
Knowing all this time/that I was right
You finally don't belong
So if we're done here
I think you should bit your tongue
I'm sick of watching you come undone
How can you blame me for the mistakes you made?
I swear I've been here before
And you can't change if you were made that way
You saw the worst in me
And now I can't go back
And now I can't believe
You saw the worst in me
Cold hearts are never warm when you need them to be

I never wanted to be loved by anyone
It was never enough
I won't punish myself for this 
These are the choices you've made, so deal with it

So if we're done here
I think you should bit your tongue
I'm sick of watching you come undone
How can you blame me for the mistakes you made?
I swear I've been here before
And you can't change if you were made that way
You saw the worst in me
And now I can't go back
And now I can't believe
You saw the worst in me
Cold hearts are never warm when you need them to be

I never wanted to be loved by anyone
It was never enough
I've got a cold heart
I'll watch you come undone

I never wanted to be loved by anyone
It was never enough
I've got a cold heart
I'll watch you come undone
