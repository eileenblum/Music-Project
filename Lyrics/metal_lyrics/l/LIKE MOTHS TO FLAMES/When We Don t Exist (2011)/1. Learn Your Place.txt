[Deluxe Edition Track]Don't give me false hope
This is the darkest that I've ever felt
I never asked so don't assume that I would need your help
Well I'll never fucking need it again

Now the devil's reaching up to me
I think I feel his hands around my neck
I've never felt this pain
I've never been here before

Convinced I'll never be the same
You've never lived in my mind
You can't decide what's fair
Now learn your place before I put you there

I know you're terrified to die, die
Not hard to see by the way you slowly life your life

I'm still content with everything that I continue to create for myself
You never needed to drag me through the hell
That you've been feeling inside
This is the place that we've been dying to find

These nights still drag me down
But you will learn your place when I climb out of this hell
If you've been dying inside
This is the place that we've been dying to find

These nights still drag me down
But I will find my faith when I climb out of this hell
I know I'll never forget
This is the place that I will always regret

Fuck all the faith I found
So far it's only let me down
I'm doing more with life than you can say for yourself
Fuck all the faith I found
So far it's only let me down

Patience is never enough
And all you ever do is complain and want for more

I'm still content with everything that I continue to create for myself
You never needed to drag me through the hell
That you've been feeling inside
This is the place that we've been dying to find

These nights still drag me down
But you will learn your place when I climb out of this hell
If you've been dying inside
This is the place that we've been dying to find

These nights still drag me down
But I will find my faith when I climb out of this hell
I know I'll never forget
This is the place that I will always regret

Save me from hell
