Just stay away,
stuck in a hole that's too deep for me to climb out.
There's no where left for me to go,
so just leave me here on my own.

Stay away,
I've had enough and you've pushed me too far.
I know that I will be okay,
so just leave me here on my own.

My own grave!

When we don't exist,
then there's something to miss.
And when we don't remember,
well then how can they say forever?

My mind won't let me think clearly,
I'm too far gone and I don't know if you can hear me.Stay away,
I've had enough and you've pushed me too far.
I know that I will be okay,
so just leave me here on my own.

My mind won't let me think clearly,
I don't know if this is where I'm supposed to be.

We don't need to be reminded
of the nightmares that we can't forget.
They made me feel alive,
but lately I don't sleep at night.
We don't need to be reminded
of every tragic path we take,
that leads our lives into the grave.

Just stay away,
I've had enough and you've pushed me too far.
I know that I will be okay,
so just leave me here on my own.

My own grave!

When we don't exist,
you'll know you deserved it.
When we don't exist,
you'll know you deserved it.

My mind won't let me think clearly,
I'm too far gone and I don't know if you can hear me.
My mind won't let me think clearly,
I don't know if this is where I'm supposed to be.

We don't need to be reminded
of the nightmares that we can't forget.
They made me feel alive,
but lately I don't sleep at night.
We don't need to be reminded
of every tragic path we take,
that leads our lives into the grave.

I'll never close my eyes,
these nightmares still keep me alive through the night.
I'm losing my grip on live.

I'll never close my eyes,
these nightmares still keep me alive through the night.
I'm losing my grip on live.
