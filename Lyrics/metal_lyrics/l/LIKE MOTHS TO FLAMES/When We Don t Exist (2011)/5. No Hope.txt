Where there's no hope
How can we make it alive
It's so separated and nothing's alright
We live our lives so lifelessly
It's so hard to exist and not to believe

But I'll die still wondering why
I tried to live my life to let you inside
But I'll die still wondering why
I ever let you into my life

We live our lives to feel like we belong
So we don't care when the good die young
And though there's nothing there
I can make it through
I'm sorry but I swear
I don't need you

We don't live our lives to feel fucking hopeless
But this time you made me hate myself
How did I let you in my mind
Get me out of this life
Just get me out alive

I won't come back again
So separated
Just get me out alive
So separated
When there's no hope
How can it change for the better
I'm at the bottom and I don't remember
The way that it was before
When there's nothing left here anymore

We live our lives to feel like we belong
So we don't care when the good die young
And though there's nothing there
I can make it through
I'm sorry but I swear

I don't need you here
I don't need you here

So we don't care when the good die young
And though there's nothing there
I can make it through
I'm sorry but I swear
I don't need you

We live our lives so lifelessly
There's no hope
We live our lives so lifelessly
There's no hope
How can we make it out alive
We'll never make it out alive
