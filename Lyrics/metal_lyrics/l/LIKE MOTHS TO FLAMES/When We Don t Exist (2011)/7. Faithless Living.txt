So what's the point when
I look around and still feel nothing
Don't say you never saw misery coming
There's only so much I can take

Before my body begins to bend and break
Do you feel agony?
I don't know what I believe
Why does it matter to you?
When will you let me be?

I think I've lost my faith
And I know something in me changed

I've never had a chance to speak for myself
Why was I left here searching for something else?
I've never found a place that I could call my home
So far away from what I've known

So far away from what I've known

So what's the point when
I still don't know why I was put here in the first place
Why is this happening?
Something's changed
I've lost my faith
We were born into a life of hate
I hate everything about of the way you look at me
I hate everything you say and everything you believe

All of this pointless living
Began to ruin you
I hate the person you've become
And what you put me through

I've never had a chance to speak for myself
Why was I left here searching for something else?
I've never found a place that I could call my home
So far away from what I've known

I've never found a place that I could call my home
So far away from what I've known
I've never found a place that I could call my home
So far away from what I've known
I've never found a place that I could call my home
