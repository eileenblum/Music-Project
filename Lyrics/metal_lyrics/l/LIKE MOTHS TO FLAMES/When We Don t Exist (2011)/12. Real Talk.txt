There's no one to call your own 

You watched them bury me, 
You are the darkness that spreads through my body, 
You watched them bury me, 
You are the darkness that's growing inside me

Now we can take some time, 
I've been fine, 
So just believe, 
You're dead inside, 
We're dead inside, 
You were the death of me

I'll take some time, 
if you've been fine did you believe, 
that I can't take back what's mine, 
I'll take two years and I'll 

Take some time, 
but I'll be fine, 
I'll be there waiting for you, 
Take some time, 
I've been fine, 
I've been here waiting for you

I'll sit and I'll watch this crumble, beneath your feet,
how many times until you remember everything, 
No one to love, and you're so dead inside, 
No one to love, so now I'm taking back what's mine 

Your life won't change the world, 
so stop pretending, 
but take your time to come back to me, 
we'll all be waiting, 
I'll stay out but I won't follow you down, 
I'll keep my feet in my grave, 
Bury my head in the ground
In the ground, 
You watched them bury me, 
You are the one I regret, 
they took my head and they buried me
In the ground, 
You watched them lie to me, 
You are the one I regret, 
I'll take my head and I'll bury it

Now we can take some time 
Take some fucking time, 
but I've been fine, 
I've been here waiting for you, 

I'll take some time,
if you've been fine did you believe, 
that I can't take back what's mine, 
I'll take two years and I'll

Take some time 
but I'll be fine, 
I'll be there waiting for you, 
Take some time, 
I've been fine, 
I've been here waiting for you

Take your time and wait, 
we'll be here waiting for you, 
Take your time and wait, 
I've been here waiting for you.
