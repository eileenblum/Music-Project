Iâve come this far without you,
I know you thought that I would let this die
You had your opportunity to take everything from my life,
And you expect me to believe,
In everything that you push me on

In years youâll thank me,
For everything that I did for you,
This time Iâll try to remember why I ever trusted you

You lost the best thing to happen to you,
And Iâm letting go,
I know that you wonât remember me,
And I wonât remember you

Now listen motherfucker,
This will be,
Everything that you dreamed itâd be,
But I can promise you one thing,
It wonât be done without me

So tell me who you will turn to,
Knowing that I

I will watch every piece of your life fall apart,
Falling further apart,
I will watch every piece of your life falling further apart

You lost the best thing to happen to you,
And Iâm letting go,
I know that you wonât remember me,
And I wonât remember you

If this is hopeless then Iâll die with this world alone.
