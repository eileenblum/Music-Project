You finally gave up,
so tell me why in the hell,
would this be any different,

Is this what you expected?
Is this what you hoped that I would be?

This place will never be my home,

As far as I can remember,
Everyone's looking out for themselves,
It's blood for blood and
I've come to eat you alive,

I've come to eat you all alive,
I've come to eat you,

You never thought that you'd see the day,
Let's not pretend that this will be okay,
Now this is my world,
You made the mistake of pushing me away,

I've come to eat you alive,
We've come to eat you alive,

This wasn't meant for me,
This place will never be home,
but I will find you,
I will find you,

I bet you never imagined what it'd be like,
to be inside of a world that's all mine,

Is this what you expected?
Is this what you hoped that I would be?

This place will never be my home

I bet you thought that you were safe,
We've come to eat you alive,
I bet you thought that you were safe,
We've come to eat you alive,

This wasn't meant for me,
This place will never be home,
but I will find you,
I will find you,
