[feat. Landon Tewers of The Plot In You]It will never exist, 
No matter how many times that you
Play this out, 
When will it fucking set in? 
Your memories and everything about me, 
Are slowly fading

Remember me as the one that got away, 
And I'll remember you and everything, 
That you will never change

This world is mine, 
There's nothing for you, 
So don't think that I, 
Will find respect for you, 
I was the one, 
That you could turn to, 
But this world is mine, 
And there is nothing from you

You'll sort this out, 
When you find it falling apart, 
And after everything even my family, 
Expected nothing from you

Expecting something from me, 
Are these your memories?

Remember me as the one that got away, 
And I'll remember you and everything, 
That you could never be

Even my family 

You took everything from me, 
My life and my self esteem, 
And now I'm taking you with me, 
I'm taking this, 
I am bringing you to the
Bottom of this

This world is mine, 
And I am everything that you could ever love, 
This world is mine

And I am everything 

You took everything from me

My life and my fucking self esteem, 
You took everything from me, 
My life and my family

I will bury you and
Everything that you believe in.
