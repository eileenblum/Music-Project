[feat. Ahren Stringer Of The Amity Affliction]Buried my skeletons inside the darkest part of my thoughts
Cut out the bones and left a space for the light to shine on
Stitched up the seams when I felt overgrown
Cut out the bones that made it hard for me to stand on my own

I carry my mistakes and never let them define me
I will walk alone but I won't follow blindly

Do you dream our lives could be so different
From this hell we live in
Now it seems
This life has killed the dream that I've dreamed
I never meant to leave you all behind
But nothing good lasts forever
I never meant to leave you in the past
But nothing good will ever last

Skeletons became the only thing that I could trust
Cut out the bones and left a space for collecting dust
Stitched up the seems finally let go
Cut out the bones when I felt fucking alone

Remove whats left in my chest
In every good life there is an image of death

I carry my mistakes and never let them define me
I will walk alone but I won't follow blindly

Do you dream our lives could be so different
From this hell we live in
Now it seems
This life has killed the dream that I've dreamed
I never meant to leave you all behind
But nothing good lasts forever
I never meant to leave you in the past
But nothing good will ever last

Remove whats left in my chest
In every good life there is an image of death
