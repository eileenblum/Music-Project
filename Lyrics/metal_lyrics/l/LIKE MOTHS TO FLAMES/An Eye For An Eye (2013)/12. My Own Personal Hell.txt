Detach myself
Through my eyes I see the world
My own personal hell
Is this all in my head?
These demons know me so well

How do you drown out the voices when you're all alone?
That pry at the walls you've built inside your mind so long ago
How do you drown out the voices when you're all alone?
They pry at the walls inside your mind and leave you nowhere to go

There is nothing worth saving
Marked for death
We all die alone when we breathe our last breath

There is nothing worth saving
Marked for death
Unchanged
There's no cure for the pain

I've fallen out of love with the world
We want what we don't need
We fear what we can't see
I've fallen out of love with the world
There's no cure for the pain
A heart that can't be changed

Detach myself

How do you drown out the voices when you're all alone?

I've fallen out of love with the world

A heart that can't be changed

There is nothing worth saving
Marked for death
