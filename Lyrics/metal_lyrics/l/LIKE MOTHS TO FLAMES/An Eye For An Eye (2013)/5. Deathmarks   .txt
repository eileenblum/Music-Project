Born too numb
Patience is wearing thin
Consumed by struggle
Overwhelmed with angst
Stuck in my bitter skin

Born too numb
When all is said and done
You have to learn to walk
Before you ever try to run

Fuck this life
That only
Take
Take
Takes from me
I will stand firm on my own two feet

Dead inside
Time only
Break
Break
Breaks me down
Don't know what more you could expect from me

Walking in the shadows of the night
A clearer conscience
Everyday becomes a different fight
Walking in the shadows of the night
Hard to see what's in front me
When everything's in black and white
Where do we draw the line?

An eye for an eye
Ends up making the whole world go blind
and the sins that we selfishly hide
Have left our pitiful lives in decline
Where do we draw the line?

An eye for an eye
Ends up making the whole world go blind
and the sins that we selfishly hide
Have left our pitiful lives in decline
Where do we draw the line?
