Nothing but blood
Can change what you have done
I've bled myself enough for you
The holy one

The dark swallowed the day
I watched the sun burn out
Heard the devil praise my name

Empty from the start
Head to the ground
Blackened my heart

There will never be a white light to save me
Despite the bullshit you force fed me to believe
No more sympathy
For the fucks that can't stand up for what they think

Close my eyes so i can feel alone
It helps to see the intent of a world I've outgrown

My lack of faith showed me that this place is no longer a sanctuary
The place you call out to the sky above
Sanctuary
The place you go to feel a false fucking love

Why do we fear
What we're meant to be now
The lies they sold us
Why do we hide
When we're meant to be free
Somehow we bought what they told us

We're the thorn in your side
Cast the shadow of doubt right out now
We're the thorn in your side
And that crown you wear is rusting out now

The dark swallowed the day
I watched every color fade
into a hue of grey
I heard the devil telling me not to let go
Begging for me to leave this sanctuary

The place you call out to the sky above
Sanctuary
The place you go to feel a false fucking love

Why do we fear
What we're meant to be now
The lies they sold us
Why do we hide
When we're meant to be free
Somehow we bought what they told us

We're the thorn in your side
Cast the shadow of doubt right out now
We're the thorn in your side
And that crown you wear is rusting out now

We're the thorn in your side
There's comfort in a darker sky
We're the thorn in your side
Not letting go until I know why you were sent to die
We're the thorn in your side

Nothing but blood
Can change what you have done
I've bled myself enough for you
The holy one
