What doesn't kill me
Feels more like a noose around my neck
I've overcome the fear of death
Hung my hopes with the same rope
That will lead me to my end

Hollow now without a sense of regret
Forgive but never fucking forget
Choices that we make define our shallow graves
Is this life worth the sacrifices made along the way?

Cut ties with the ghosts I've left behind
Goodbye my empty silhouette
Cut ties with the ghosts I've left behind
Goodbye a past that I regret

Forgive but never forget
Cut ties with the ghosts I've left behind
Goodbye my empty silhouette
Forgive but never forget
Cut ties with the ghosts I've left behind
Goodbye a past that I regret

I've overcome the fear of death
Hung my hopes with the same rope
That will lead me to my grave
Hung my hopes with the same rope
The past doesn't deserve to be saved

What doesn't kill me starts to separate
Break me apart piece by piece
What doesn't kill me starts to separate
Everything that I'll ever need

Hollow now without a sense of regret
Forgive but never fucking forget
Choices that we make define our shallow graves
Is this life worth the sacrifices made along the way?

Forgive but never forget
Cut ties with the ghosts I've left behind
Goodbye my empty silhouette
Forgive but never forget
Cut ties with the ghosts I've left behind
Goodbye a past that I regret

Forgive but never fucking forget
