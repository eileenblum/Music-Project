[feat. Shane Told Of Silverstein]Into the ground
Got used to watching every year go by
With thoughts diluted I stood at the end
While my days turned into nights

Reliving everything
Every fucking memory
Desperate to feel to get back the time that I've been missing

Where do you go
When moments you embrace become hollow
What will it even be worth
when we sell our souls to live on this earth
Tried to sleep but found comfort in my lack of dreams
We hesitate to let go
Afraid of what we might see

Give me back what fills the void when my minds at the edge
Never thought it'd feel this way
Give me back what these moments all used to mean
Before life got the best of me

Theres still no sign of life here
My demons sing me to sleep in fear
That the dark has left me for dead
To die alone in the place I called my home

Too young to be this fucked up

So where do you go
When moments that you embrace become hollow
Find your way when you get lost and there's no one there to guide you
Tried to sleep but found comfort in my lack of dreams
We hesitate to let go
Afraid of what we might see

Give me back what fills the void when my minds at the edge
Never thought it'd feel this way
Give me back what these moments all used to mean
Before life got the best of me

Got used to watching every year go by
With thoughts diluted I stood at the end
While my days turned into nights

Reliving everything
Every fucking memory
Desperate to feel to get back the time that I've been missing

Give me back
Reliving everything
Give me back
Every fucking memory
Give me back
Desperate to fell to get back
Give me back
The things I know belong to me
