There is no truth in life
Only in death can you find that there is no peace
and what it means to be alive

There is no truth that will set you free
Swallow your tongue before you try to say what's best for me

You don't know
Never walked a day in my shoes
and I'll be damned if I turn out like you

Malicious the way you twist your words
This vicious cycle that I'm in feels more like a curse
When will enough be enough
The world's been dead to me for too long

So sing me a sad song
and tell me that I'll never belong
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm all wrong
But the world's been dead to me for too long

Sad songs
You and me we'll never belong
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm all wrong
But the world's been dead to me for too long

You don't really know what's best for me
Save it for someone else
So before you open your mouth
Know I don't need your help
What I really need is for you to go fuck yourself

So tell me
Does it give you that sour taste that you hate?
There'll be no peace between you and me
Does it give you that sour taste that you hate?
There'll be no peace

So sing me a sad song
and tell me that I'll never belong
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm all wrong
But the world's been dead to me for too long

Sad songs
You and me we'll never belong
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm all wrong
But the world's been dead to me for too long

Does it give you that sour taste that you hate?
To know I'll go my own way
Does it give you that sour taste that you hate?
So sing me a sad song
