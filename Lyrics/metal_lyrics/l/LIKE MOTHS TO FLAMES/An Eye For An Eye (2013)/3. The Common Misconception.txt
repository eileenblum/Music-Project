Realized there's nothing left but apathy
Can't seem to manufacture feelings the way you do so easily
Tired from trudging through the dark in hopes of brighter days
Sick of swallowing everything that I've wanted to say

It's hard to stomach the thought
of all the things you're told
When growing up means growing old
Becoming jaded from the life you lead
The common misconception that we're existing

Why do we cling to a voice that's always silent?
Too busy searching for the love we will never get
Why do we cling to a life that we'll never know?
Too busy searching for a better direction to go

Until it all fades away

Live and learn
As I move on that my heart gets colder
and the distant tides have turned
As I move forward the world gets colder

Live and Learn
As I go on that my heart gets colder
and the distant tides have turned
As I move forward the world gets colder
Until it all fades away

Bring this cold heart back to life

It's hard to stomach the thought
of all the things you're told
Can't fit the shape
Can't fit the mold
Becoming jaded from the life you lead
The common misconception that we're existing

Why do we cling to a hand that never reaches back for us?
Too busy searching for a meaning in what we've lost
Why do we cling to the life that we'll never know?
Too busy searching for a better direction to go

Until it all fades away

Live and learn
As I move on that my heart gets colder
and the distant tides have turned
As I move forward the world gets colder

Live and Learn
As I go on that my heart gets colder
and the distant tides have turned
As I move forward the world gets colder
Until it all fades away
