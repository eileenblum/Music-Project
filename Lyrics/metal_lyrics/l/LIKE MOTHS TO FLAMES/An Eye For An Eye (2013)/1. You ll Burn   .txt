I will gladly bite the hand that feeds
Without a compromise
You drew the line at what was yours
and what's not mine
A snake sucking at the heart of this
More guilty than you'd like to admit

Rotting on the inside
Dividing myself in two
I saw the devil with my own eyes
and he fit the shape of you
A fucking coward
With a tongue to tell a thousand lies
Cover your red hands
But you can't hide your poisoned mind

Say what you want
I've held these words for long
You're the bottom feeder
Someone that I'll never need here
Say what you want
Taken for granted all I've done
Infested by the thought
that you can never be wrong

I'll never trust anything
that you think that I might want
You are the scum and we're the hearts you dwell on

So sick so sick
Of trying to prove myself for worth
When you take what I deserve
So quick so quick
To point the blame then turn and run
You'll burn for all that you've done

Torn the hopes of everyone I love
and now it's your turn
You can get fucked

Say what you want
I've held these words for long
You're the bottom feeder
Someone that I'll never need here

I'll never trust anything
that you think that I might want
You are the scum and we're the hearts you dwell on

So sick so sick
Of trying to prove myself for worth
When you take what I deserve
So quick so quick
To point the blame then turn and run
You'll burn for all that you've done
With a tongue to tell a thousand lies

I will gladly bite the hand that feeds
when it doesn't feed enough
Cover your red
You're fucking guilty scum
