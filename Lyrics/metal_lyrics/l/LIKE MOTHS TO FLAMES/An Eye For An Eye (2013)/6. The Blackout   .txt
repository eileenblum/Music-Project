You said this time would be the last
Around in circles we go again
Not holding back the way I used to
A death in me is a death in you

You said this time would be the last
Around in circles can't catch my breath
When will you see my point of view?
A death in me is a death in you

When we collide
You'll know what's on my mind
I hope this cuts you deep
And you lose sleep at night
I died inside
The day you took away what was mine.

Visions of a world without the sun
This is a blackout
Where all the ends come undone
We tried to follow paths you made
You said this time would be the last
It never changed

Visions of a world without love
This is a blackout
Where all the ends come undone
We tried to follow paths you made
Misled, you're now the enemy.

You said this time would be the last
Around in circles we go again
Not holding back the way I used to
A death in me is a death in you

You said this time would be the last
Around in circles can't catch my breath
When will you see my point of view?
A death in me is a death in you

A death in me is a death in you
A death in me is a death in you

Visions of a world without love
This is a blackout
Where all the ends come undone
We tried to follow paths you made
Misled, you're now the enemy.

[2x]
You are everything I despise
Your life is such a fucking lie!

You said this time would be the last
Around in circles we go again
Not holding back the way I used to
A death in me is a death in you

You said this time would be the last
Around in circles can't catch my breath
When will you see my point of view?
A death in me is a death in you

Visions of a world without the sun (a death in me is a death in you)
This is a blackout where all the ends come undone (a death in me is a death in you)

Visions of a world without love (a death in me is a death in you)
This is a blackout where all the ends come undone (a death in me is a death in you)
