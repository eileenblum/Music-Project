Waste away another night
Can't leave this bed I've made
Given up on life

God only knows I've tried
To be better
There's nothing left inside

I got so lost along the way
Could never find the words to say
Waited for the dark to change in me
Watched as the seasons faded away

It's easier to just let go
Rather than dwell on all I used to know

Come wake me up
I've been asleep for too long
In a life that's not my own
Lost myself
So cold

Come wake me up
I've been asleep for too long
Never wanted to feel alone
Lost myself
Slow to love
So cold

Can't leave this bed I made
Given up on life

God only knows I've tried
To be better
There's nothing left inside

I got so lost along the way
Counted down all of the days
Waited for signs from a distant place
Watched as the seasons faded away

It's easier to just let go
Rather than dwell on all I used to know

Come wake me up
I've been asleep for too long
In a life that's not my own
Lost myself
So cold

Come wake me up
I've been asleep for too long
Never wanted to feel alone
Lost myself
Slow to love
So cold

Through each and every year
You destroy who you are
When you try to disappear
Take me back to the start
Mend all the pieces that fell apart

We watch the world turn
But never stop to think about
Who we are
Take me back to the start
Mend all the pieces that fell apart

I've been asleep for too long
In a life that's not my own
Never wanted to feel alone

Come wake me up
I've been asleep for too long
In a life that's not my own
Lost myself
So cold

Come wake me up
I've been asleep for too long
Never wanted to feel alone
Lost myself
Slow to love
So cold
