I'll set fire to your legacy
Up in smoke without sympathy
Crashing to burn in your misery
False idol another voice for the sheep
I'll set fire to your legacy

No love lost
I wrote you off before you knew I was gone
No love found
No one to blame but yourself

Say whatever fills your cup
I'm here to tell you no one's rising up
Don't you notice they've turned away
I'm here to tell you nothing's what it seems

I'll set fire to your faith you'll reap what you've sewn
Reserved is a place for you to rot alone
Rot alone

Say whatever fills your cup
I'm here to tell you no one's rising up
Don't you notice they've turned away
I'm here to tell you nothing's what it seems

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Nothing what it seems
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Nothing's what it seems

Marked for death since the day you were born
Marked for death since the day you were born
Marked for death

Say whatever fills your cup
I'm here to tell you no one's rising up
Don't you notice they've turned away
I'm here to tell you nothing's what it seems

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Nothing's what it seems
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Nothing's what it seems

I'm fucking done
