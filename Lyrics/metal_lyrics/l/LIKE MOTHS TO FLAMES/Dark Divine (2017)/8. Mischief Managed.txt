Die slow when comfort bleeds you dry
You'll see I'm not the forgiving type
Fool me once shame on you
Now fool me twice fuck everything you put me through
All things aside I know you better than you know yourself
And I will never wish you well
All things aside I know you better than you know yourself
I'll never wish you well

Dig yourself from the bottom
Watch you lose yourself again
It's your curse
That tells me it could be worse

Heavy is the head that hangs with regret
Never wanted to burn but you did
When push came to shove
You pushed the world until it swallowed you in
Rock bottom gave out from underneath
The world gave up on you and your dreams

So paint yourself a new name
I watched the world give up on your dreams
While I watched you sink

Dig yourself from the bottom
Watch you lose yourself again
It's your curse
That tells me it could be worse

Dig yourself from the bottom
Watch you lose yourself again
It's your curse
That tells me it could be worse
It could be worse

I see the tables turn
And all your bridges burned
Nothing like a little spite
In pure disgust to feel alive
I see the tables turn
And all your bridges burned
Nothing like a little spite
In pure disgust to feel alive

Dig yourself from the bottom
Watch you lose yourself again
It's your curse
That tells me it could be worse

Dig yourself from the bottom
Watch you lose yourself again
It's your curse
That tells me it could be worse
Could be worse
