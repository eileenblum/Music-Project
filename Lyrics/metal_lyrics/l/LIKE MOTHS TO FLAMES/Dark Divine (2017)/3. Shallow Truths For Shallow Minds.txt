Sleepwalker
Twisted perception of the earth
At war with reality
Destined to search for infinities
Destined to follow never to lead

There's no escape
Your silhouette is sure to fade
No matter what you think
There's no escape
We end up the same
It all repeats

What a waste
Trading all your mistakes for saving face
What a waste
Blame it on brand new faith your saving grace

Sleepwalker
New chemicals to breathe
Lungs built to collapse under uncertainty
Finding hope in a lie
Shallow truths for shallow minds

There's no escape
Your silhouette is sure to fade
No matter what you think
There's no escape
We end up the same
It all repeats

What a waste
Trading all your mistakes for saving face
What a waste
Blame it on brand new faith your saving grace

Whoa oh
Whoa oh
Whoa oh

What a waste
Blame it on brand new faith
Your saving grace

Nothing good ever comes to the ones who wait
Blind only lead the blind to the fucking grave
Destined to follow never to lead
Destined to follow never to lead

What a waste
Trading all your mistakes for saving face
What a waste
Blame it on brand new faith your saving grace

Whoa oh
Whoa oh
Whoa oh

What a waste
Blame it on brand new faith
Your saving grace

Sleepwalker go back to sleep
