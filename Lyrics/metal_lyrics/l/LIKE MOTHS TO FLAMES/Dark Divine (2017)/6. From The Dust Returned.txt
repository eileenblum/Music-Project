There's nothing left of me for you
I'll get through like I always do
You'll end up just as I'd expect
Take for granted everything I had to give

I've had enough
Gave everything I had but it didn't have the touch
'Cause it's lost on a shelf collecting dust
Every word about my hell
These nights I don't dream sleep is nothing but a luxury
And the price has become too steep hard to believe there's any hope for me

The ones we should fear the most
Are the ones we give all of our hope

Now I'll sleep with one eye open
How do I learn to trust again
When all I know is fighting from the bottom
Hard to know what's left here in the end

Down and out is right where you left me
No good deeds without a fee
Surviving by the hand that fucking feeds
Hard to win
When you're always dealt the same hand
Forced to fold I never had a chance

Now I'll sleep with one eye open
How do I learn to trust again
When all I know is fighting from the bottom
Hard to know what's left here in the end

War inside my fucking mind
Living only to exist expiring with time
War inside my mind
Expiring with time

The ones we should fear the most
Are the ones we give all of our hope

Now I'll sleep with one eye open
How do I learn to trust again
When all I know is fighting from the bottom
Hard to know what's left here in the end

Now I'll sleep with one eye open
How do I learn to trust again
When all I know is fighting from the bottom
Hard to know what's left here in the end

(What's left here in the end)
