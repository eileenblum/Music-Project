I feel dead in this room
Hear the sound of waves
I close my eyes
And it brings me back to life

I've been alone in this room
It's had to cope with the skeletons
I keep under my skin
I'm losing faith in faith again

Days repeat and they turn to weeks
Stuck here in between
Wishful thinking it never works
Haven't got the nerve

When I'm trapped here under water
Let me dream
When I know I'll drown under water
Won't you let me sleep
When I'm trapped here under water
Let me dream
When I know I'll drown under water
Won't you let me sleep

I'm losing faith in faith again
Confined to a hell that I call my mind
The skeletons I keep are fighting to survive
Fighting to survive
I'm losing faith in faith again
I'm losing faith in faith again

When I'm trapped here under water
Let me dream
When I know I'll drown under water
Won't you let me sleep
When I'm trapped here under water
Let me dream
When I know I'll drown under water
Won't you let me sleep

I feel dead in this room
Hear the sound of waves
I close my eyes
And it brings me back to life

When I'm trapped here under water
Let me dream
When I know I'll drown under water
Won't you let me sleep
When I'm trapped here under water
Let me dream
When I know I'll drown under water
Won't you let me sleep
