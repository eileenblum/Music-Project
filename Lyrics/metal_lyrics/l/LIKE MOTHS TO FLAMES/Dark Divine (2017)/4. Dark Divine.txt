No light inside my dark
These walls speak louder when I'm alone
No love without a heart
Gave and took until it all put me back at the start
No in between
I let the world get the best of me

There's no light inside my dark

If you could see inside my head these days
You'd be so lost you'd never find your way
Cold to the touch there is no saving grace
There'd be no way to fill this empty space
I know it's not what you'd expect

Don't you say that I sound too jaded
Always over-thinking
Long way to go from here
Don't you waste days that I feel unworthy
Numb to my worries
Long way to go from here

There's no light inside my dark

Haunted by a ghost of my own
I tried to talk to God and he just gave me a rope
Heaven's so far Hell feels close
All that's left for me is just to let this go
Let this go

Don't you say that I sound too jaded
Always over-thinking
Long way to go from here
Don't you waste days that I feel unworthy
Numb to my worries
Long way to go from here

Hollow and alone
Not meant to be loved
Forever on my own
Hollow and alone
Forever on my own

Don't you say that I sound too jaded
Always over-thinking
Long way to go from here
Don't you waste days that I feel unworthy
Numb to my worries
Long way to go from here
Long way to go from here
Long way to go from here
