I can't remember why I ever tried felt it in my bones
Can't make your wrongs my own
Making the same mistakes more rain on my parade
When I should have known never to get this comfortable

Sick of giving all my best
Only to get your worst
Sick of time lost at the end
Investing more than you're worth
Never knowing what it's like to have a day of peace in my life
I'm over thinking every situation I can seem to find

I should have known
I should have trusted
My instinct never proves me wrong
I should have known
I should have listened to my intuition

Constantly black and blue
Bad luck only leads to bad news
When searching for the truth
Now there's nothing more
Disconnect myself pull the cord
Disconnected from the world

Sick of giving all my best
Only to get your worst
Sick of time lost at the end
Investing more than you're worth
Never seen greener sides
I've been colorblind to everything but black and white

I should have known
I should have trusted
My instinct never proves me wrong
I should have known
I should have listened to my intuition

Damned to suffer at the hand of another
Bend 'til I fucking break
Bend 'til I break

I should have known
I should have trusted
My instinct never proves me wrong
I should have known
I should have listened to my intuition

I should have known
I should have trusted
My instinct never proves me wrong
I should have known
I should have listened to my intuition

Bend 'til I break
'Til I fucking break
