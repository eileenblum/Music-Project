I just want to feel
Seems like I'm holding on
Never know what's real
Until it's all gone

Does it hurt to know I can't get out
Well I'm cursed it shows all around

I know that these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think
There's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
In my head

It's getting harder to see the forest from the trees
And what I can't avoid keeps coming back to me
Complacent while I kill these empty thoughts
Stuck in a place I swore that I'd forgot

Does it hurt to know I can't get out
Well I'm cursed it shows all around

I know that these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think
There's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
In my head

Write me off it's all that I know
Wasting words when I should just let go

Failures will not end
Failures will not end

I know that these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think
There's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head

I know that these failures will not end
Never seen the bright side anywhere
Just when I think
There's nowhere left to sink
I find that these failures are in my head
In my head
In my head
