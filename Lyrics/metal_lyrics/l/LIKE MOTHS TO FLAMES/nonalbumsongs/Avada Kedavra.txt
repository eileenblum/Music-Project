Have you found a way to ruin me yet?
you drag me down,
but after all of this I will be the one that's left,

This world will not die,
when you're gone,
I will still remain,
you never believed in me,
and it's time for me to do the same,
so lie about what you've become
and lie about what I became,
a wasted life,
you're nothing that will never change

So let it go when your words mean nothing,
I never believed in a thing that you said to me,
so now that I let this go,
It's time to live your life

Now you lie,
to speak of what I've become,
but you can't change this,
I've already won

I am the one

When will you wake up and face that there's nothing,
there's nothing here for you,
no one for you to call on,
I will not be the one,
to pull you out again this time,
you told me everything that I'll never be,
but this is your life,
so lie and face what you have made,
and lie to say that you can change,
this is your life,
so face what you became.

I am the one
