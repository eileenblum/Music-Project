Iâll spit back every word that you threw in my face
Hell is home either way
Another nail in the coffin
For the first time in days, I see clearly
I wonât lead myself blindly to the light
Thereâs no truth that will give me peace of mind

What did you expect?
For me to bow down and beg for forgiveness?
I won't give in
How does it feel for your words to be irrelevant?
Just know that there will be no song of grace to lead you in
No holy water that will rid you of your sins
There will be no light to pull you from the dark side
Left to decay inside your own lies

Fiction will never become fact
To each their own
We all breathe our last breath alone
Fiction will never become fact
All hope is dead and gone
Heâs never coming back
I will bear a new cross to show what Iâve lost

Speak now or forever hold your tongue
When you look up to the sky above, do you feel anything but empty love?
The dying things youâre living for

Give it up
Give it up

There will be no song of grace to lead you in
No holy water that will rid you of your sins
There will be no light to pull you from the dark side
Left to decay inside your own lies

I will never repent
My bloodâs already been spent
Choke on the words you preach
Youâre not heaven sent
I will never beg for your forgiveness
I will never repent
