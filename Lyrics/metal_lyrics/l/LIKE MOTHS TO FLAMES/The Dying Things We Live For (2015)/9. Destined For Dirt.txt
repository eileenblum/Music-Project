Left for the vultures alone to rot
Youâre nothing but a shadow of a person that I forgot
A silhouette to remind me of what Iâm not
Youâre just a shade; a duller color than you used to be
Death is a lesson that youâll learn the hard way

Too little too late
Iâll watch you manipulate every beautiful thing youâve seen
Youâre just the scum left underneath
Too little too late
Such a bittersweet way to relive hate
With darker days ahead
Hard to love with a heart thatâs already dead

Born destined for dirt
Truth should hurt
I wish you nothing but the worst

Thereâs no time youâll get back
No matter what you give, when the clock runs out youâll be left to relive all that you tried to hide away
Thereâs no escape from the skeletons you keep in your grave

Too little too late
Iâll watch you manipulate every beautiful thing youâve seen
Youâre just the scum left underneath
Too little too late
Thereâll be no use for a name on your grave
No one will remember you anyway

When fate decides itâs time for you to die
Iâll be the one to pull the noose tight
When fate decides, I'll be the one to pull the noose tight

Death is a lesson that youâll learn the hard way
