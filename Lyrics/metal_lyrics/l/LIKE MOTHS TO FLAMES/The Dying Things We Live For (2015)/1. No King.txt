You become transparent when youâre held to the light
Even at your worst I tried to make the wrongs right
You pulled the wool over my eyes
Sick of burning at both ends
You push to break the bend
Never someone Iâll defend
Couldâve been shouldâve been
You say it was never supposed to be this way
Built up to come crashing down with your name
Couldâve been shouldâve been
You say it was never supposed to be this way
Return to dust the same way that you came
You should know better than anyone
The past can never be undone
Blank stares from the people you once knew
Your downfall is overdue
Youâre no king
A broken crown sits at your feet
Pieces of what you used to be
You only see what you want to see
You become transparent when youâre held to the light
I think itâs time you learn to take loss in stride and walk away from whatâs mine
Rock bottom and youâre falling faster every day
Youâll find no compassion
Youâll find no sympathy
Return to dust the same way that you came
There is no compassion
No sympathy
Return to dust the same way that you came
Youâre no fucking king
