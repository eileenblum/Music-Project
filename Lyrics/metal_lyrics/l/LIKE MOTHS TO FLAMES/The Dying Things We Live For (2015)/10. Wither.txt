If all you love is everything thatâs killing you
I know your pain and what youâre going through
I swear it never rains anymore; only pours
A different day with the same war

If all you love is everything thatâs eating you up
I know your pain
You feel like youâve had enough
Youâve lost so much you donât keep score
A different day fighting the same war

To say a prayer would mean I had some faith
But I guess distance got the best of me
All it did was teach me how to hate
Weâre all devils in our own hells trying to escape
Memories we canât erase

Good things never come; I give up
Grown to love not being enough
Remove me from the frame
A picture that was meant to fade away
Wither away to grey

To say a prayer would mean thereâs a glimpse of hope in me
Thatâs something that Iâve never seen, but Iâd walk on water if it made me believe
Itâs only sink of swim
Thereâs no chance for me with these concrete limbs
I know all your love is the cause of your grief
I know exactly how you feel
Youâre the same as me
Weâre all devils in our own hells
