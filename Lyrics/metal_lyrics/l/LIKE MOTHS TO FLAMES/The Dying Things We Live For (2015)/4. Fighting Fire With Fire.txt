I'm trapped inside a cynical way of thinking
Why even bother with a world that pulls me down when I'm sinking?
What I'd give to be naive
The only way I can feel is to disconnect myself from everything
If you can't come to terms with the life that I choose to lead
Stay the fuck away from me
If you can't come to terms with the life I choose to lead
Stay away from me

I won't get stuck on looking back
We're all so guilty of wanting what we'll never have
Fight fire with fire, there is no desire in me
To be like anything you want to see
I'll write you off, write it all off
No second thoughts
You can trace the lines to connect the dots
Write you off, write it all off
No second thoughts
You can trace the lines to connect the dots

Nothing gold can stay
Every breath you take will bring you closer to your dying day
Too much time to contemplate the black and white
I refuse to sell my soul for a place to die

I don't owe the world a god damn thing
I don't owe the world a god damn thing
I don't owe the world a single thing
And I won't get stuck on looking back
I won't get stuck

I won't get stuck on looking back
We're all so guilty of wanting what we'll never have
Fight fire with fire, there is no desire in me
To be like anything you want to see
I'll write you off, write it all off
No second thoughts
You can trace the lines to connect the dots
Write you off, write it all off
No second thoughts
You can trace the lines to connect the dots

So if you can't come to terms with the life that I choose to lead
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay away from me
I don't owe the world a god damn thing
Stay away from me
