I'm counting down until the day that I can close my eyes
Sick of the lows that come with the highs
Iâm counting down until the day that I can reach past the light
To find there is no other side
Searching for hope becomes a disease
Too sick to live, too sick to bleed

You make things hard on yourself
When you start bleeding out for someone else
These are the numbered days
We can't erase
Don't spend a lifetime making the same mistakes
Over and over again
We cave in, without thinking
We throw ourselves to the wind
Over and over again
We cave in, without thinking
We throw ourselves to the wind

I'm counting down until the day
That the sun swallows the world whole and all of Hell follows
I'm counting down until the day there's nothing left inside me
And all my bones are hollowed out
Searching for hope becomes a disease
Too sick to live, too sick to fucking bleed

Too sick to fucking bleed, go
Too sick to bleed
(To sick to bleed)

You make things hard on yourself
When you start bleeding out for someone else
These are the numbered days
We can't erase
Don't spend a lifetime making the same mistakes
Over and over again
We cave in, without thinking
We throw ourselves to the wind
Over and over again
We cave in, without thinking
We throw ourselves to the wind

We throw ourselves to the wind
I'm so sick of all the lows that come with the highs
I'm so sick of all the lows that come with the highs
