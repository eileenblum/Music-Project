They always seem to kick me when Iâm down
What a way for them to tell me Iâm worth nothing more than dirt on the ground
Just pull the chair from underneath my feet and throw me out into the cold streets

They say some things are better left unsaid
To know the truth would be too much for me to comprehend
Force fed to believe thereâs something more for me
Set up to fail with no chance to succeed

Wasted days spent watching my life pass by
Take me away
Back to a better time where Iâm not standing in line ready to die
I know Iâve been here before, questioning everything
Left with my heart on the floor

Kick me when Iâm down
Numb to the pain
A face with no name
Just pull the chair from underneath my feet and throw me out into the cold streets

They say some things are better left unsaid
To know the truth would be too much for me to comprehend
What you see is never what you get
Distorted hope for the hopeless

In sickness and health
This black cloud will follow me âtil Iâm burning in hell
