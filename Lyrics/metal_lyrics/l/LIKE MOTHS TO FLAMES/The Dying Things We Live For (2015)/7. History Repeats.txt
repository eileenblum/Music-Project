It comes and goes in waves
Will there ever be a life worth all the pain?
While theyâre building you up, youâve gotta prepare for the hang
Bitter winds blow in to remind you of time you spent killing yourself
To find an empty bed
Killing yourself to find a place to rest your head

Nothing green on the other side
Death has no compromise
History repeats the same routine again
Itâs hard to play this game when you can never win
Caught between everything that you need to be
And what you want for the world to see
Itâs hard to live with yourself when neither side can be pleased

It comes and goes in waves
Will there ever be a life worth all this pain?
When thereâs nothing left for them to take, you leave out the same way you came
Bitter winds blow in to remind you of the things youâll miss
Killing yourself to find a better way to live
Killing yourself to find a meaning in this

Learned to love the misery and lack of company that death is promising me
Learned to love the misery and all of the tragedy that death is promising me

A little hope will get you nowhere at all
You reap what you sow
We are not eternal

It comes and goes in waves
Will there ever be a life worth all this pain?
While theyâre building you up, youâve gotta prepare for the hang
Bitter winds blow in to remind you of the time you spent killing yourself
To find an empty bed
Killing yourself to find a place to rest your head

We are not eternal
