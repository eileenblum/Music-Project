Nothing will be waiting for you at the end of this life
So make your peace with it
When you become a silhouette to the world
There's no light to lead you in
The colors that you love begin to fade away
You'll find you never got what you gave

Fuck wishing for better days
Complacent in the mess you made
Self inflicted
You're to blame for your pain
Left to rot an empty soul inside a hollow hell
I gave up on you long before you gave up on yourself

You bit off more than you could ever chew
How will you measure your life at the end when it's through
Watch you dissolve
Wither away
Death will be your only infinity

Make your peace with it

It's hard to wish you the best
Don't crawl back
Don't forgive me
Bury your pain in a shallow grave
It's hard to wish you the best
When all you do is let me down
I never needed you around

What's left to say
That's not already been said before
I don't feel hope anymore
What's left to say
Let it fade away

I gave up on you long before you gave up on yourself

You bit off more than you could ever chew
How will you measure your life at the end when it's through

No hope for better days
Death will be your only infinity
Misguided by a false light
Nothing will be waiting for you at the end of this life

Make your peace with it

It's hard to wish you the best
Don't crawl back
Don't forgive me
Bury your pain in a shallow grave
It's hard to wish you the best
When all you do is let me down
I never needed you around

What's left to say
That's not already been said before
I don't feel hope anymore
What's left to say
Let it fade away

I gave up on your long before you gave up on yourself
