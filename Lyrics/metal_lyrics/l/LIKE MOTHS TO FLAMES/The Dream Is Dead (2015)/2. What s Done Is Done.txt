The world is better off without you

Now you're nothing but a ghost to me
Tucked in the back of my head
A headache that will never end
Rest assured
Worse off than I was before

Why
Why feel at all
Why
Sympathy just leads to loss
Why
A heart of stone
Why
I won't bear your cross

Let all I love die away
Watch it burn up in flames
No silver lining in front of me
The bend before the break

What's done is done
To hell with everything you ever said
You left me lost
You left me haunted
What's done is done
To hell with everything
The dream is dead
You are the ghost I never wanted

At war with everything
That keeps me alive
That keeps me breathing
Burning bridges is the only way I keep from sinking

Why
Why feel at all
Why
Sympathy just leads to loss
Why
A heart of stone
Damned to walk this earth alone

The world is better off without you
You're nothing more than a dying fucking memory

The world is better off without you
You're a dying fucking memory

What's done is done
To hell with everything you ever said
You left me lost
You left me haunted
What's done is done
To hell with everything
The dream is dead
You are the ghost I never wanted

Let all I love die away
You left me lost
You left me haunted
Watch it burn up in flames
You are the ghost I never wanted

You're a dying fucking memory
