Your heart is a diamond
Every soul wants to steal it
From your fort your fort of skin
You let nobody in

Your heart is a diamond
A bleeding treasure
Crushed together by grief and violence
Tons of pain, big pressure

Your heart is a diamond
So hard and cold
So uncut and so silent
In a breathing vault

Thatâs my heart
Let me help it feel
Thatâs my heart
What they all want to steal

Your heart is a diamond
Every man wants to steal it
Deep inside your fort of skin
You keep yourself concealed

Good hearts are so hard to find
I will wait and stay
A diamond ring will take its place
Around my soul one day

Thatâs my heart
Let me help it feel
Thatâs my heart
What they all want to steal

Thatâs my heart
Let me work that mine
Thatâs my heart
Let me help make it shine

I lick your heart
I taste the pain
I kiss your skin
It feels the same
Your bitter lips
Thereâs no light at the end of the tunnel
Between your hips

Thatâs my heart
Let me help it feel
Let me in to guard
What they all want to steal

Thatâs my heart
Let me work that mine
Thatâs my heart
Let me help make it shine
