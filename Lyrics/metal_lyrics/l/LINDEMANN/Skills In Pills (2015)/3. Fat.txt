Your dirty sweat
My sweetest potion
Your armpit swampy
Little oceans
Your flappy butthole
A soggy cave
I put in my parts
And let them bathe

[Chorus:]
Call me freaky, call me sick
I like it sticky, I like it big (Fat!)
I hate it skinny, I hate it flat
I don't need mini, I like it fat

People laughing about your size
We can fuck them on your French fries
When I break open your king size bra
Your giant boobs are just wunderbar!

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Every night, I have this dream
Iâm sliding down, a slippy stream
Straight in your mouth, the smack is strong
I eat your lips, your furry tongue

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So call it crazy or call it fate
Just with you I want to get laid
But your holes are hard, so hard to find
It doesnât matter. I fuck you, fuck you from behind!
