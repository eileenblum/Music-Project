Black lips, brown eyes
Wet flesh, good size
So hot, when it crawls
I burn for dicks and holes

[Chorus:]
Ladyboy
Ladyboy
He is my toy boy
My ladyboy
Ladyboy

Just for fun
No romance
Two in one
I'll take my chance
All you can eat
It's hot as coals
I drown my meat in dicks and holes

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I got shot with the sweetest gun
I have it all, all in one
No broken hearts, no bad romance
Why should I love when I can have fun
With my ladyboy

I got shot with the sweetest gun
Never mind what I have become
Why should I love when I can have fun
With my breathing toy

[Chorus]

Ladyboy
