Born in the breath of a vicious sea
The beast came with the rain
Fallen upon your milky skin
A cunning drop crawled in your vein

Never ever got prepared
So shaken, helpless and so scarred
Search the needle in your hair
Gone bald there's nothing there

Home sweet home
Inside you, eating your bones
Home sweet home
Eyes on fire lips in foam
And it's called the cold
It's caught inside you
And it eats it eats and grows
Inside you and it never goes
And it never goes

Two more days the end's in sight
Tumor days so deep inside
So distressing and very violent
And it kills it kills so slow and silent

Never ever got prepared
So shaken, helpless and so scarred
Search the needle in your hair
Gone bald there's nothing there
And nothing there

Home sweet home
Inside you, eating your bones
Home sweet home
Eyes on fire lips in foam
And it's called the cold is cold
It's caught inside you
And it eats it eats and grows
Inside you and it never goes

And it never goes
And it never goes...
