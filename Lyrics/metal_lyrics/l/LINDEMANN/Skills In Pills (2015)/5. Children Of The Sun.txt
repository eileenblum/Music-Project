Dressed in sparks and light
Showered in dazzling white
We are the childrens of the sun
The nightfall is about to come

The sky turns red
A frightful sign
So we run
We're running out of time

[Chorus:]
Because
We live only one day
We only live one day
We are in heaven but we can't stay
We live only one day

Daylight counting hours
Worshipped by the flowers
Related to mars and moon
But the night is coming soon

The sky turns red
A frightful sign
So we run
We're running out of time

[Chorus]

And when we die
No place to stay
We are in heaven anyway
We have to go
The sky's in flames
We're going down in purple rain
Purple rain..

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And when we die
No place to stay
We are in heaven anyway
And after all the night arrives
Darkness comes and eats us alive
