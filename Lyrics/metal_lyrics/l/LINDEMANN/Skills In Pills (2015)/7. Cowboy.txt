Since I was a kid I had this dream
I want to be a tough guy, wide and mean
Flying bullets, flying fists
Born to ride and to be kissed

[Chorus:]
Cowboy, cowboy
We can ride
Any horse and any bride
Cowboy, cowboy
Comes to town
Beat you up and shoot you down

I wear my blue jeans very tight
Please the ladies every night
They put money in my hat
Makes their husbands so upset

[Chorus]

Cowboy, cowboy never die
Feels no pain, never cries
Cowboy you get all the chicks
Big, big horses and big dicks

Was never wild, never mean
Never joined a cowboy scene
I just ride my rocking chair
Hide my teeth in tupperware
Cowboy, cowboy, this is sad
Vomit in your cowboy hat
Cowboy, cowboy, this is fun
Lost the bullets, fuck your gun
Cowboy, cowboy, we died
Every night I have to cry
Cowboy, cowboy, what a prick
Drunken horse and shrunken dick
