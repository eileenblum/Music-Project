Flesh to flesh I embrace you,
and my heartbeat is quickened with lust.
The darkness obscures my true nature,
and my lesions of weeping white pus.
As my tongue now enters your vulva,
unholy transfer is begun.
Behold pathogenic corruption,
in the horrid rebirth of my young.

The womb is infected with life-giving sperm.
Urethral migration of writhing white worms.
The pustulent clam full of smegma continues to squirm...
Long after climax!

Churning, tearing, my essence within you is burning.
Raping, changing, reshaping your flesh as it likes.

The womb is infected with life-giving sperm.
Urethral migration of writhing white worms.
Oh how this pustulent clam full of smegma will squirm...
Long after climax!
As I bite at her face and my seed burns her skin,
the putrid gestation is coiling within.
Behold the sickening creation of rancid disease...
I spit from my loins!

Feeding them while you suffer...
as your flesh they convert into fuel.
Tearful gaze on the fruits of your pleasure,
you will not be the last of my whores!
