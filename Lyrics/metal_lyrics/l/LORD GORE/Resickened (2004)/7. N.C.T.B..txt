An appetite for the stench of death.
Mouth slavers for decaying matter.
Guts shudder to anticipate.
Whether circuits, poisons, germs or mammals.
Silicon to masticate, carbon sludge assimiliation.
Deadly gay spores invade, rancid flesh has long decayed.
Eviscerate the mecha-guts, deconstruct the fleshy creatures.
Decompose the pathogenis, re-absord the techno vomit.

[Lead: Maniac]

Slag falls to Earth as waste.
Steaming proto-plasma splatter.
All fuek fir the omnivore.
Whether circuits, poisons, germs or mammals.

Necro-chemo-techno-biophagic!
