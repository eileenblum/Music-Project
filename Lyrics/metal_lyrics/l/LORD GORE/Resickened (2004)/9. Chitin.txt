Forced from the depths of the oceans
A malevolence older than man
Crude and unspeakable creatures maligned
With contempt for all life that exists upon land
Bringers of genocide arrive with the blood red tide
Primal occult driven plague they herald the end
Armored with terrible purpose
Encrusted envenomed burning with rage
Brandishing flesh-ripping pincers
To grasp disembowel and scavenge their prey
Hate single-minded of purpose
Is churning in brains of primordial design
Hunger torments they march to the air
Appendages churning a froth from the brine
Can't believe what they see pathetic and weakened
Humanity
Murder crawls on eight legs doom comes for you
Horrors rising death from the sea
Incomprehensive stygian madness
Things that should not be
Shiny ebony spike laden shells glistening sickeningly
Nausea injected with venomous thorns
Render by necrotic means
Deafening screams calls to unknown gods
Waves transmitted by alien glands
Annihilate human ears
Land slickened with shredded remains
Peppered with severed limbs
Crushing their cities to powder
Erecting their unholy shrines
Monsterous crabs blaspheme the idols of man
Awakened by arrogance unleashed to slaughter

[Lead: Maniac]

Forced from the depths of the oceans
A malevolence older than man
Crude and unspeakable creatures maligned
With contempt for all life that exists upon land
