One couldnât imagine a use of words as a solid description. But why waste another ounce of energy, while attempting to disguise the taste of pure blood in the mouth of the unwarned. They taste it too. But not nearly as profound. Naturally the blurring of the vision
quickly follows the initial sight. Tension in the jaws of life to the destroyer but of death to the receiver. Soon it will end gloriously. The beauty unmatched and the colors inspiring. Leaves will fall. Grudges will burn.
