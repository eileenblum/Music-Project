If Assumptions were facts, we wouldnât need answers. Although you claim you heard my response your reaction suggests conclusions were self delivered. Fucking listen. This is less than glamorous; this is an opportunity to feel the absolute power of selfish desire. From
this point on itâs us against the world and we are not outnumbered. Ignorance is bliss, if you can forget this but I doubt you will. I will drive it to your fucking core if need be and I wonât ask you to forgive me. Mark my words: Hope will be your downfall.
