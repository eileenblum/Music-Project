Iâve been here before Iâve seen these bloody walls. I own the hands that covered them in crimson. Life spilled forcefully. The impact of this moment will stay with both of us forever. You wouldnât recognize me now. I have no remorse. I seek no answer. What was once a
weakness has become a reason to look the deadliest truth in the face with doubt. This will end well because Iâm writing it but in reality wishes are for the weak. If anything ended anywhere else but death it was a road. Dirty and dark. Iâm not sure we should be here.
