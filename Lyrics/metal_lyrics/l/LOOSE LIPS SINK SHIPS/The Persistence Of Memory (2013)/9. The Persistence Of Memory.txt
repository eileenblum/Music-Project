Emotional emptiness turns insides black. As memories fade slower than blind men understand. The ears of the deaf are lined on brick walls raised inches above the ground. Every grain of glass circled by a flame of misfortune. A reason to worry introduced within a feeling
of care. Failure to attach to those around is the death of a rose. The path pushed towards is one worn by few. Four footprints to begin. Midway reduced to two. Realization of what was once ours is a nightmare in itself. Flawless but concealed behind the mask is everyone
else.
