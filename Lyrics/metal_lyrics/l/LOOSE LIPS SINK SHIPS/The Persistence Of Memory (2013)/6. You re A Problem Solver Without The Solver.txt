I canât say Iâm afraid because I feel nothing when I look at it. But I am a floating carcass in the waters of expectations. Falling short of the shore. Look at the way the teeth show. Watch the way reality goes. I am not going to make you proud and I wonât apologize for
that. I will not follow in the footsteps youâve never walked, but wished for me to see. You will not claim me when I finally reach land I am convinced theyâll bury me in the sand.
