Guilt scorches and chews on the bitter end. Renewed but are we there yet? Realizing the consequence is half the battle, but deciding to handle it is nothing at all. The action for which we attribute our attention to the broken ones is never necessary but always enraging.
We will accuse ourselves of nothing unless backed into an unforgiving corner. If we could watch ourselves exist hatred is all we would feel.
