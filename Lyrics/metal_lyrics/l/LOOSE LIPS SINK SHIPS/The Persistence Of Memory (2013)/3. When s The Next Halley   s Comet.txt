I saw respect lost. I watched days bleed into nights. I found no interest in the black eyes of the stars that surrounded me. âYou donât believe in anythingâ. Why bother with the places we crawl in life? Itâs a wonder beginningâs can be called new. Iâve fucking seen it
before. Scratch marks leading to the door. As the illusion of safety disappears, we are born. Forgetful but to the grudge we grasp. Ill advised and intellectually unflattered. If you count each raindrop, you will chalk it up to a waste of time. Mirroring the hours spent
creating a fairytale that always seems to end too soon.
