What the fuck am I losing my head? I donât understand the flaws of a closed and a racing mind. It just seems too difficult to comprehend the aggressive behavior of my subconscious in its current position. I canât help but ask just to clarify: whatâs the point of living
if you donât feel alive? A myth, a legend, a marvelous feat to become and acknowledge that you are complete, almost unheard of due to its complication this makes it a mere fabrication. These images in time will fade away wonât they? How long until I can sleep through
the night without expecting you to be by my side? How disappointing the places, the things we will never see. This is why I will remove this broken bridge from beneath my feet.
