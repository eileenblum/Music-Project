You are at your most beautiful when you are underneath my sledge hammer I love to watch your vitals puddle around
As I feast off the blood from your wounds white mixed plasma drenched in dead flight crown from your cracked talons
Scratching through your fattened belly your eggs your filth your pitiful end this is my new throne
Your disease clustered nest here I rest and rule denouncing your remains
You will recover soon in time only to get destroyed again
You do not deserve a name just an absolutely worthless specimen
