The density of hollow bones sinking polars crumbling like dust
Growth extinction I will take what's mine if it comes off of you
Like a virus betraying its host from carrion through false gravity that dribbles out bloodsucking screeches
Vulturous monolith parasitic in structure blight amalgamates with weakness
To simply devour what helplessly survives from those that feed off the inanimate
