Failure of limbs putridity bursting from immediate decay son kills son
Emblems clot stigma wounds once flourished beg for bread with crumbs of lowest flesh
Thorns that breed dead genesis he who melts upon his cross kept penance lifted alone on pedestals
His soulless doctrine that withers away pried tombs apart for tarnished beliefs disintegrate thy icons

Faith through massacre grace from misery condemned for the higher purpose
Carving the prayers onto their tongues punctured slightly into greed
Hark the coming of plagues ten all lepers pool and ooze into one on form as it is in spirit
Exiled from the ghost itself letting bodies rattle in the cage of brittle euphoria
