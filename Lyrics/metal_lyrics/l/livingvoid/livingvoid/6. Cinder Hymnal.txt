Bodies stained red cloaked in sewage dearest creator of the holy arson
From glory of tribute to the ultraviolet lest the lights sunder seeking salvation
Herald in the glowing embers new days new blessed water I touch turns into kerosene
Corrosive and pure minions to my torch oaths that burn like rust
Praiseth be to the bringer of flames bathe within the pyre
Peons hear me worship everything I have turned into ashes
