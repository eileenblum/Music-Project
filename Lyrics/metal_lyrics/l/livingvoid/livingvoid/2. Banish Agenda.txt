Blackened bleeding dimensions diminished from coils of frailty and vacuums
We are reality unwoven unbecoming and listening forever to the nulls
The world erodes into an open curse hibernation rested upon aeons of cold nothing slumber
Announcing the coming of its new tyrant his empire built from dust and particles
All hail the new king rejoice in his malevolence "all that is matter is hereby obsolete"
