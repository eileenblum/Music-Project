Why can't you tell me what's true?
You lie to protect myself
and I dive in the earth
my heart is beating so fast
You live to lie and cry to die
We just need someone else

They want
To take
Your flesh
To feed me

Pray for our lives and our souls
Don't ask me why our eyes are so far
Come with me my world is so beautiful
Don't leave mre and I won't let you fall

They want
To take
Your flesh
To feed me
