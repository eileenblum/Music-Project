So old that no one thought this
But someone was going to try
To make himself a rich man
Maybe to the cost of his life
The hidden treasure
Attracts innocents

The terrible old man
Carved them into pieces
Horribly mutilated
Ignorance of bodies
And now
Smiling hideously

He frightens the little boys
When he's speaking with his jars
Filled with formalin
Filled with human pieces
His yellow eyes
Unveil his cruelty

The terrible old man
Carved them into pieces
Horribly mutilated
Ignorance of bodies
And now
Smiling hideously
