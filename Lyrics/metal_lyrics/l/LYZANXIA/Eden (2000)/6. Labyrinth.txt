Strayed in this infinite labyrinth
I heard a distant breath
Footsteps came from the bottomless cave
Of possible means to escape
&gt;From the bowels of the earth
In the darkness I called for my courage

Seeking an arm to defend myself
My lungs emptied their air
The point of encounter was imminent
I imagine the face of the creature
The panic seized me
Then came the scream of the beast

The breath is now very close
The light became more intense

The breath is now very close
The light became more intense
I'll be haunted forever
Aware I'd killed a man
