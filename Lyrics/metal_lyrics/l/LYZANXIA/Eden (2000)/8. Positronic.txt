Through a mental deficiency
Our brains still think
Between two medecines
Our heads are still bleeding

Soon our souls will be changed
Into integrated circuits
And our veins will be filled
Some oil replace my blood

We have to fill our memories

Black,so black,our teeth will be
And electronic eyes to see
My fingers begin to creak
We press the switch to awake

We have to fill our memories
