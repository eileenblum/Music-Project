I'm sorry,forgive me...

She comes to me but it's too late
I died last night I couldn't wait
She cries on me I can not hear
She talks to me but I can't see

I'm sorry forgive me...

I'd like to choose my last hour
To give my soul and all remains
I've left you with all your pain
Now you must live reality

I'm so lost...
