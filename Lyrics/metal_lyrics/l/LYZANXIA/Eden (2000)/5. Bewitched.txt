I'll bleed your heart
To drink this milk
You'll taste my tears
To feel my scream

I've got to see
What can be real
I've got to be
Your only dream

You can't be real
You're just a dream
I'm just bewitched
Engraved in your memory

You're my victim
Get on your knees
You'll think like me
You'll live by me

You can't be real
You're just a dream
I'm just bewitched
Engraved in your memory
