Feel alone...abandoned
Tired to exist
Go through life
Dive so deep
you leave the world
Fly in a new death
Searching the light

You can see the dome
Come into the dome

Ask yourself some questions
Try to be seen
Touch the cold skin
Look at the pale faces
This is your hell
You don't feel anything
But you're watched
Look for the only living soul

You can see the dome
Come into the dome

A request for the other side
Don't try to escape
Now you belong to me
I just want your soul
You've got no choice
Your body runs away
But we are every where you are
It's time for you to die

You can see the dome
Come into the dome

Now the pact is not the same
You will stay,you'll be my slave
You tried to betray me
You'll never leave the hell
Your flesh will be my meal
Your brain will be my trophy
Your eyes will be my rubies
Your heart will make me live

Now you're coming back to life
You've been at Devil's door
You think it was a dream
Just the purgatory
