The first step
Erase data brain
Create gaps
Then fill the empty space

Replace
Defective cells
Destroy
All the remains

Beyond the supreme being
Outlive the experiment
They need organic matter
They keep the carnal coil
Save exhausted neurons
Beyond bearable pain
Increasing his intellect
Want him to be perfect

Implants in his head
Strengthening his damaged thought
He didn't choose to be
Virtual reality

They steal our brain
Bind me to stay
Our minds away
Experiment failed

Allowed to make a mistake
They try to extract ache
They're not afraid to fail
His cortex is near frayed

They steal our brain
Bind me to stay
Our minds away
Experiment failed

No secrets
That we can guess
First test
To become medecine slave
