Last dream I have stolen
Fantasy and passion
Lost men lose their thoughts
I feed prophecy

I take your life
Your dreams and your lies
We enter light
I blind you

I imagine the nights
To catch creation
I throw again the fights
I've got a new conception

Last dreams I have made
New sensation
My rest is a broken blade
I'm near extinction
