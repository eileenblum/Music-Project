Betray your world
Show your anger
Throw your pride
Stay the master

Lance your skin
Fight your own pain
Choose your tribe
Kill the other ones

Weep for your friends
I bury your friends
Scream at yourself
Don't need to bless them
You bury your soul
Don't betray me

Buy the souls
Win confidence
Feel your way
Invade the lands

Say your rules
Create your thoughts
Foresee your end
Ignore the fear

Weep for your friends
I bury your friends
Scream at yourself
Don't need to bless them
You bury your soul
Don't betray me

Must show your anger
Stay the master
Must fight your own pain
Ignore the fear
And if you weaken
I'll grind you up
I'll tear you to pieces
For dogs your remains
