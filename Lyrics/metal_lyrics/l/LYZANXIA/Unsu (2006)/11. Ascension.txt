Screaming
A bone cracking
Sky
Turning to night
Find Her
(Be)fore she succeeds
lead us
To your last book
Signs
Cabalistic
Creature
Watch her crouching
Looking
In emptiness
Angel
A Pretender

The thing
Can crush you
Swallow
souls in a wink
Circle
The message out
Dying
She heard the voice

I don't pray
That seems so strange
You'll never stop fighting
I always trust in you my friend
You step inside
And now she's dead on the ground
About to enter the dawn

Dark age
A blurry air
Shockwave
propagating
howling
as inhumane
Light fault
tearing the sky

And Now learn, the best of you'll stay
You're still clinging, little man

You're a few to push us away
Sacrifice of our spectrum
