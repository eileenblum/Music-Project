Unconscious paralysis keeps me walking
Without feeling any pain, I came back home
"Ache Power Control" woke me up during night-time
Somnolence that I can't control, enters my life

When Light
Kiss back
Nothing appears
So clear
No Fear
I'm near
Just here

Something troublesome behind me, I can't figure what
My hand touching my back, tries to catch the light
Deep set in my body, I cannot take it off
It's stopping messages from my brain to my legs

When Light
Kiss back
Nothing appears
So clear
No Fear
I'm near
Just here

I Can fight, Can brave, Now
Create your swarm and fly
I can fight, confront now
Create your swarm and Rise

From now on, nails in the wood carrying my shell
Adrenaline effect stopped extreme pain in me
I soak panic up, impression I ever feared
I'm hoping a bad dream is happening to me
