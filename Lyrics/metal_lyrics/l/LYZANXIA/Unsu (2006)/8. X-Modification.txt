YES THERE IS A POINT AT
WHICH MODIFICATION
BECOMES TOO EXTREME
BUT I DON'T AGREE

WHEN I WAS SUSPENDING
NOW IT'S EXTREME
THE PAIN STUCK IN MY MIND
CRIMINAL IN THE SOUL
DANGEROUS RANGE
GRIND KILL DANGER
REFLECTION OF THE LIGHT
WE ARE THE GLASS SOULS

GRIND, KILL, TO ME ITâS ALL THE SAME
AND EVERYTHING (IS) STUCK IN MY HEAD
(IT) DOESN'T SCARE ME, I AM POWER
I DON'T EVEN FEAR TO MEET MY PASSING NOW
