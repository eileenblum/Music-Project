What I feel,
What I was thinking about
Was my next fight

Contemplate

What I fear
Is no one else but myself
Out of control

Strength in my head rules me
"-If you loose, don't stop, retry, reply"
(My) Mind leads my body
"-Cause you can't live without struggle"
I need adversity
"-You must fight against your shadow"
Strange criminal soul

Sweaty skin
Is hiding anxiety
Time is coming

Minor rites
Are making me feel alive
In the fight now
