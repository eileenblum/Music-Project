It's the only time
My memory deletes
Something I don't want to know anymore
Those visions which I eliminate
Destruction of a conscious mind

In my early days
Complicated applications
When my ghost accepts all forms of intrusions

Taste you, Help you, Test you
Try to find a way
Taste you, Help you, Test you
When your heart is crying
You're away
When your dove dies

I try
Mini mental state examination
I'm erasing those deeply engraved haunted visions
Corrupting impulsive reactions
Special memory disorder

Taste you, Help you, Test you
Try to find a way
Taste you, Help you, Test you
When your heart is crying
Taste you, Help you, Test you
You're away
Taste you, Help you, Test you
When your dove dies

Early Phases
Anger Extreme
Early Phases
Anger Extreme

Now, I bury images
To the deepest place in my head
Dry the blood which is my dreams
I won't be serene till the end
