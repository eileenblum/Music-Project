In my room I asked myself questions
Looking for something which could engage my thoughts
Closing my eyes, looking for what I need
Void is invading me, nothingness (is) my host

Details and sounds are bothering me
Feeling that I don't get enough time before me
Can't think anymore, panic is entering my senses
(I) create futile actions, ignore consequences

-Stand by your friends
-I fill my heart
-Don't move away
-Of grudge and pain
-Don't cross the fence
-Can't face my last
-I hold your hand
-Amazement

There is such recurrence in my head
Treatments couldn't stop this tedium
Fear of being unsatisfied
Passion against envy
I wait for sleepiness to wake up
The day which makes me live again
I'll reach this idea
Then, the next is you

Can reach this idea
