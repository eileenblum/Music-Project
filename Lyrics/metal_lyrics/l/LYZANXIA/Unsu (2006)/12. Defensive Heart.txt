Around me, there is not much success
Around us, there's a lot of insanity
She looks at me, considers me a dog
She treats me like a worthless worm

The black sphere is characterized by the reflection of your being
Your reactions are scaring me, but I can't live without that fear of you
My lack of self-confidence stills in me, I have to breathe with it
Your presence is a drug, addicted to you
I'm just scared âbout the way you react

Your white sphere where I've never been,
a special place where you'll never let me in
Enslavement turns me into your doll,
instead of letting me become a man

FEEL DEFENSIVE
YOUR WORDS ARE SO LOUD
BUT WHEN YOU COME INTO MY ARMS
I NEVER GET ENOUGH
You're vital, you're vital...

The passion which links me to you Is devastating the rest of my humanity
Killing obsession for someone so cruel,
A jewel that still blackens under the light

Rebellion
And the rage is riding you
Insurgence
And the rage is riding you
Uprising
And the rage is riding you
Mutiny
And the rage is riding you
