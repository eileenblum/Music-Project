Never give us full confidence
Never turn away from us
Never cross our way
Stop to decide
Never set yourself against us
When you're mad

Coming from nowhere
We do the last crime
Running somewhere
Ready for gametime

Learn to conquer our unkindness
Try to escape from our sight
Never in our case
We avoid the fight
Your courage makes you survive
When you howl

You'll never die
You'll never cry
Except if we order

Dazzled by the light
I don't want to fight
I'm attacked
I run through the city
Not enough time
I sell my eyes
They know I'm not innocent

My friend, you can't escape from our claws
You're not innocent
Alive until your confession
No way! Become brave

Stop! your mind's panicked!
Stop to run away!
Stop! your mind's panicked
Stop to run away!

Terrifying smile to fear you
Never try to simplify
Nothing you can do
Just hold your breath
Still have one more thing to do:
Meet your death

Dazzled by the light
I don't want to fight
I'm attacked
I run through the city
Not enough time
I sell my eyes
They know I'm not innocent
