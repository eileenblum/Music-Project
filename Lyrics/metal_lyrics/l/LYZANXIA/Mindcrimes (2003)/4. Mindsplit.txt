I am your subconscious
My method gives your roar, hear my voice
The specialist tests your mind dishonest
The expression on your face
Your signals recorded
Affection for yourself, unconscious
When you sleep
Disturbed reflection,
Reaction of your lips

Where's my blend
I'm not paranoiac
Paid by you
Run to nowhere
Say my name
I feel paranoia
Show my scar

Analyze! It reveals your disorder
Your nature unhealthy
And your twitch lets show your pangs of death
I don't want theory
Your distrust brings you to your madness
What you need shock treatment
Even the Rorschach test
D. terminates what you are

I know I'm attacked by
Split personality
And I know I can't fight
Brain activity

Where's my blend
I'm not paranoiac
Paid by you
Run to nowhere
Say my name
I feel paranoia
Show my scar

Can you tell I'm a free man
Without fear and pain
I hear voices in my mind
Telling me to forget

Remember what you've done
During your ignorance
Time is yours
A sort of Mr. Hyde
Where's Jekyll ?
Becoming heroic
Denying your secret
Your suspect behavior comes to light
I predict your downfall
If you're still my subject
