Cry for me
My memory: flashlight
My disease, and my secret, forget

Permanent amnesia
Dominant breakdown

Try to see
What my brain can contain
Fear for me
Always hysteria

Permanent amnesia
Dominant breakdown

I'm away, so
I pray for life
My life is free
I'm away, blind
My death is blind
Corrodes my sight

Dry my veins
And remember my past
Please tell me
If I have amnesia

Permanent amnesia
Dominant breakdown

I'm away, so
I pray for life
My life is free
I'm away, blind
My death is blind
Corrodes my sight

You could be the origin of my secret
So please show me,
Show me what kind of man I was

Existence is not the past that you choose
Silence don't cure me
Tell me what was my life before
