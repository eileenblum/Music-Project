My arms fall down
Grids on my way
Paralyze them
Grim landscape

Can't see dead boys' blood
Can't feel cold in my neck
Can't touch synthetic gold
Can't scream "I'm so scared"

I pray for you my friend
From killing you'll abstain
So many men you've slain
I can't forget

So far... die
No more lies
Fear, caus' I fine
Learn, take my lies

My existence
Mixed to weird scenes
Leads resistance
Smashing barriers

So Far...die
No More Lies
Fear, caus' I fine (your being)
Learn, take my lies

Hearts disguise fields
Mines in my body

So far...die
No more lies
Don't fear, caus' I forgive (your fault)
You'll learn, to take my lies

Prepared to live with powerful machines, endowed with intelligence
Prepared to live with death machines, endowed with intelligence
