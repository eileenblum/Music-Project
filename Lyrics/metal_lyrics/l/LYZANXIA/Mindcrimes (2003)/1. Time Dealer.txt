Time makes my pain subside
Allowed to lives some instants more
Dissolute: unbearable thing
I steal children eyes to ease my obsession

why do I feel my being so culpable?

Want to leave
I can't stand anymore
Not so weak
Leave my dependence
Can resist
To stare at my fate
Victim of my crimes
Pay with my blood

Fine when I catch my optical money
Withdrawal symptoms I suffer
I rob my own kid's sight to pay
The great shadow comes, I fear my time dealer

why do I feel myself incapable?

Want to leave
I can't stand anymore
Not so weak
Leave my dependence
Can resist
To stare at my fate
Victim of my crimes
Pay with my blood
