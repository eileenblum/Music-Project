I talk to you little doll
Made out of scrap and cloth
You're my only confidant
Always listening to my sins

I need relief once again
Your advice for my ill sense
Forgives me for committed crimes
For these that I'm gonna make

I've expected suffering
I've liberated my fancy
I'm the cause of horrible things
Absolution for me

- You have to repent, you!
- I'll do it
- and realize your faults
- I know them
- To swear to proscribe them
- Oh yeah I swear!
- Today you are forgiven

What can you bring me after
Final disaster

I can't resist my death wish
I can't control my body
My acts dictated by feelings
Overcome by relapse need

I Know I am incurable
Understood: impossible
My only friend after all
Is you scrap and cloth doll

- You have to repent, you!
- I'll do it
- And realize your faults
- I know them
- To swear to proscribe them
- Oh yeah I swear!
- Today you are forgiven

What can you bring me after
Final Disaster

Confess crimes...
