Boy, don't retreat into silence
A direction that you can not take

Never say a word, give his name, precious existence.
You can break my bones, crush my feet, use violence
I can't talk to you
I'm not a traitor
No noise from my mouth
I bring you to my dementia

Torture can't hurt me, I impose my own decadence
This pain is my friend, I never cry, never fail
I could not betray
My life is engaged
Mental aberration law
The word I give you is: coma

It's not the time
I take the strain
They take my eyes
Excite my anger

Extract my tongue,
Pull out my teeth,
I take the pain, come and kill me,
I'm dumb, you lose your time
I don't scream
You'd never force me to denounce
All what you've won: I can't pronounce
All I can do: total silence
I extract my tongue

My health is absent, I see your smile, torturing me
Slaughtered, but alive, my choice is to stop my breath
Take my pulse and feel my slashed heart
Take this last advice
Keep it, cause you won't hear it twice

It's not the time
I take the strain
They take my eyes
Excite my anger

Extract my tongue,
Pull out my teeth,
I take the pain, come and kill me,
I'm dumb, you lose your time
I don't scream
You'd never force me to denounce
All what you've won: I can't pronounce
All I can do: total silence
I extract my tongue

Alone, confidence is in me, you'll never know
Mental defective, I know what is pain abstraction
I can walk through you
My brain is a ghost
Thinking that I'll speak: mistake
Happy to be your host

Extract my tongue,
Pull out my teeth,
I take the pain, come and kill me,
I'm dumb, you lose your time
I don't scream
You'd never force me to denounce
All what you've won: I can't pronounce
All I can do: total silence
I extract my tongue
