Even (if) you confided in me
Completely into silence
Directions that we've taken
I'd never let you

I let my body,
To find again your presence
I slip on my new flesh
To become the one that you'll kiss

Sorry, but I change my past appearance
Transferred to arouse attraction
Suffer my dermination
Overcome distance

Distance...
Overcome distance

My bartered existence for you
You'd never forget me
I could do anything for you
You'll never trust me

Feeling sensations, giving me troubles
I can see what's refused to me
This broken shell that is not mine
I have to live with that

My life exchanged for a rotten body,
Porous bones as brittle as glass
Don't refuse, I'll bear my disease
Look at me inside

Inside...
Look at me inside

My bartered existence for you
You'd never forget me
I could do anything for you
You'll never trust me
