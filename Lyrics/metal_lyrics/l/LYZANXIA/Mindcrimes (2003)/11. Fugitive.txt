Cross
Battlements, eliminate troubles
Lose
Your control, keep it in mind
Keep
In the background, cover your double
Crush
Enemies, shoot them on sight

Cut
Your bonds, your chains, your arms
Steal
Your freedom, intimidate your child
Test
Energy, don't raise the alarm
Hit
The sentry, pull out your exile

So you'll rise

Choose your side
I swallow your bleeding
Hate my side
Get in mutiny
Here come sight
Right in my heart
Don't say now
I'm nowhere

Pay
The distance, possession of your mind
Call
The thing you have created
Hate
Your victims, no matter, any kind
Stay,
The only conclusion: Admitted

So you'll rise

Don't think, my life is mine
You'll see, your life is mine

Leave
Messages of your next homicide
Give
Details, of your escape
Fall
Can't fear, can't slay within light
Break
Reflections, compelled to reshape

Now we rise
