Just one more hell of a day
Black clouds in my head
Hammering always
Ain't getting nowhere
Tease the pain one more time
Not eleven yet
The steel band's roaring in my brain

What can I do with this pain?
I can't take it away
Now my body asks for
My brandy flask
One more day to drown my ache
Live with this break
Something I need to extract from my brain

Incurable
Your brain is infected
Solution
Is to freeze your disease
Cryogenic
You'll live but unconscious
A long wait
Until science cures you

I'm dead inside
Black side

Keep the pain inside
I don't wanna try
But I've left behind...
Slave to the time

Impossible:
Helped by the glass of pills
No more time
Take a last decision
I'm sure you're
Gonna hate that again
Fairy skies
Almost twenty below

I'm dead inside
Black side

Keep the pain inside
I don't wanna try
But I've left behind...
Slave to the time

Where's the world I knew before
I'm somebody else
Lost, scared, no more friends
All mine are dead
How many years, so wasted time
My life is loneliness
So God take me with you

I'm dead inside
Black side

Keep the pain inside
I don't wanna try
But I've left behind...
Slave to the time
