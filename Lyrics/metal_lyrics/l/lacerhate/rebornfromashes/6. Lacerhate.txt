You're praying us to stop our music
Fear is telling to do
Crying 'cause we will not stop
Hate is filling us

Every fucking day thousand people die killed by your fucking war
Fuck you assholes!
You are the cancer of the world and just like the cancer we have to remove you
Fuck you assholes!
Every fucking day thousand people die killed by your fucking war
Fuck you assholes!

I don't want excuses, I want your head
Give me a blade and I'll take by myself
Fuck your excuses all up your ass

Nothing can satisfy me but the crash of your glorious conquering ideas
Fuck you assholes!
Nothing can be more glorious than fly seeing you dying
Fuck you assholes!
Nothing can satisfy me but the crash of your glorious conquering ideas
Fuck you assholes!

I don't want your excuses, I want your head
Give me a blade and I take by myself
Fuck your excuses all up your ass

We are telling we will play forever
If end will be your crying
Fuck from all man around
Lords of the world die
