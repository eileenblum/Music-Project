Something is telling I am on the right side
Something is telling I am doing the right thing
Something is telling I am saving the world
My doubts about are gone
Now I'm sure this is the right way
Now I'm sure there is no other way
Now I'm sure I'm saving the world
My doubts are gone

This world is making us cry
This people now have to die
This world is making us cry
This is the right time to die
I know I'm dying
I'm proud to die

The shiny smile of my daughter
Just pray for this

Button just pushed by me
People are blowing away
I see a face that I know
My God...what I've done
Understood
But now nothing to do

What I've done.....only to seek God
