It's a fucking war motherfucker!

Everybody face to face with the enemy
There's the answer of those empty existence
Blinded shapes crawling bounded in the dust
Waiting the sun in a day that never come

Pray for war now
Pray for noise - explosion
Light the night, fill my heart
Pray for life now, pray for you - confusion
In disgrace this time will end

...that's the only way!

See God's face smiling at you
Anger growing inside
Pumping the sweet taste of revenge
A time to escape or the moment to fight?
You must pay the price

Be the one who never fall
Be yourself and nothing more
Light the night, fill my heart
In disgrace this time will end

Spitting out the blood of Christ

We hate to be dominated
We hate to be exploited
We hate to be indoctrinated
We hate to be dominated
