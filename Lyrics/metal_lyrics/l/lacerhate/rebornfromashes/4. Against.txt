Again war
Again against
If we'll continue to fight ourselves humanity will disappear
Soon - against

Yesterday I've seen on TV some child's body lying with closed eyes, and blood

And mothers crying
'cause children are dying

One day you'll pay for all bad things you're doing today, with blood

You should bet on it, 
One day they will kill you
You should bet on it, 
One day they will drink

You should bet on it, 
One day they will kill you
You should bet on it,
One day they will drink 
Your blood.
