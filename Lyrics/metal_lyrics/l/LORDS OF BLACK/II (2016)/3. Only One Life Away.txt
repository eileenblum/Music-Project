I wonder why promises are still made
'cause I've found there's nothing that last
Then i cry out of my desperation
For the ones i once loved in my past

For the time we will reach for the truth
And when nothing seems real anymore
But i want to find shelter in your eyes
So i can find... peace in my heart

When conscience is falling, and destiny's calling
The sins of the fathers, will go on forever

When guilty and pain, are coming at... you
Rain from the storm, Burning... like fire

When it came to deny any chance
For the ones who are lost in the rain
When you think you run safe and free
I will come to say you never will

No matter how far you can hide
I'll stand and refuse to give up
At the end of the road of confusion
There's nothing for someone who lies

When there's no forgiveness
But you keep on running
You're waiting for signs
That will they never come

Regrets of a lifetime
Keep coming at you...
Out of your mind
Into the madness

Insanity
Falling on misery
Out of the tears of a dying breed
Only to rise on the flames

Unholy cries
All this was meant to be
Only one life away from the dreams
That tear me apart from you

When conscience is falling, and destiny's calling
The sins of the fathers, will go on forever

When guilty and pain, are coming at... you
Rain from the storm, Burning!!! Like fire

Insanity
Falling on misery
Out of the tears of a dying breed
Only to rise on the flames

Unholy cries
All this was meant to be
Only one life away from the dreams
That tear me apart from you
