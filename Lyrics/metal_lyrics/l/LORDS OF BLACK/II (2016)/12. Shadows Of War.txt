No matter if they think we are the fool
I know we will make it to the end
And if you still think I'm the one you can rule
Not crazy enough to kill at your command

If this could be the last day I'll ever live
I must be repent less for what I will have to be

And when I see the world is upside down in despair
Try to fight over and over again
And when I know the time is running out to be free
I'll stand the ground...
From the Shadows of War

Whenever you think we've lost the game
Still strong long after I am gone
And if you want to keep those lies to yourself
Face the defeat just like a man

If this could be the last day I'll ever live
I must be repentless for what I will have to be

And when I see the world is upside down in despair
Try to fight over and over again
And when I know the time is running out to be free
I'll stand the ground...
From the Shadows of War
