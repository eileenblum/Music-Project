Can't feel... and my tears went dry
Once ruined by a Queen like you
Darker than the darkness... did
You came from our evilness?

I'm afraid all their hope is now gone
In my dreams I can see
I can break you

Rise up I'm the new Messiah
Deadly to your hate and fire
Evil is your endless doing
But I am your vast undoing

Wicked, twisted I forsake you
In the light I will unmake you
Lies from you I will not follow

Say again we are the same

Everything I am
Everything you're not

Faithless... turned the haven into a wasteland
Poisoned by the black of your soul

Will we ever see how the fairness used to be
But In my dreams I can see
I can break you

Rise up I'm the new Messiah
Deadly to your hate and fire
Evil is your endless doing
But I am your vast undoing

Wicked, twisted I forsake you
In the light I will unmake you
Lies from you I will not follow

Say again we are the same

Everything I am
Everything you're...
Everything I am
Everything you're not!
