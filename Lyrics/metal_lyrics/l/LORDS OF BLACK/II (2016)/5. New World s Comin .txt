Coming from the lonely winds of winter
A voice is whispering a brand new
Sound of hope

There seems no justice in a world
That's full of blindness
And words are telling you
To turn your back to the fallen

Do I have no one that I can trust?
Are you the one I was waiting in my desperate falling?

Burning out the sun
And spread the word around
Rise to the skies and heal
The broken hearts that were forgotten

Lost in the eternal night
We couldn't fight for freedom
I'm not the only one who
Will believe a New World's comin'

Try so hard to rescue something
From the ashes
When no one waits no more for signs
That came from nothing

Well, now you hear the loudest scream of retribution
A new illusion that will bring you up to the calling

And when the dreams seem to fail in vain
All I know is I refuse to give up
With no fighting

Burning out the sun
And spread the word around
Rise to the skies and heal
The broken hearts that were forgotten

Coming from the lonely winds of winter
A voice is whispering...

Burning out the sun
And spread the word around
Rise to the skies and heal
The broken hearts that were forgotten
