Wind blows so cruel this time
Silence bites even harder at night
All I have feared is the emptiness
And even my words just... can't hold on the breeze

Used to believe you were my only friend
But fool is the soul that pretends to be safe
Now is the time always knew it will come
Before the dawn be free from my past

When all hope is gone
And the snakes wear the crown
Before I'll pay for all my sins
I will make my last... call

Ghost of you
Show me the way to be free
Lost in time
Cold is the heart in the black of the night
Silent cry
You come to haunt me at night
Ghost of you
Look up to you at the end of my time

All t have feared is the emptiness
When even my words just... can't hold on the breeze
Now is the time always knew it will come
Ain't good to see
All we had is so wasted

Used to believe you were my only friend
Before the dawn I'll be free from my past

When all hope is gone
And the snakes wear the crown
Before I'll pay for all my sins
I will make my last... call

Ghost of you
Show me the way to be free
Lost in time
Cold is the heart in the black of the night
Silent cry
You come to haunt me at night
Ghost of you
Look up to you at the end of my time
