Once you told me to hold my breath...
That we had something that could live forever
But now you say you're leaving
So tell me what's forever for
Without you

Life crushed upon the shore
Where I can't hold the broken pieces
Can't find my way to you
I cannot cross that bridge you burned

When I cry my tears out in pain
And I'm praying for you just in vain
When the more that I'm calling your name
Is the more that I'm driving insane

So they keep saying life will carry on
But when you just know life...
...ain't a life anymore

Take me home to a distant dream
Where I can paint a beautiful lie
All I've ever had
All I've ever lost and
All that might be is forever gone

When I cry my tears out in pain
And I'm praying for you just in vain
When the more that I'm calling your name
Is the more that I'm driving insane

Life crushed upon the shore
Can't find my way to you

When I cry my tears out in pain
And I'm praying for you just in vain
When the more that I'm calling your name
Is the more that I'm driving insane
