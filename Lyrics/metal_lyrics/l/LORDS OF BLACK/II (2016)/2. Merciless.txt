Outrage... my dreams
Coming from the reign of sinners
Ice cold and evil
So sweet I can't resist

Endless temptation
Fascinating shadow of the night
Pleasure... loving
When darkness takes the place of daylight

I step into the Black
Unable to deny
A sinful feel of lust
Strange, uneasy, unknown
No place for innocence
when heart is pounding fast
Surrender to the call
Under the moon

Torn my soul... Burn my eyes
But i will follow you in the dark
We'll rise... As far as high
beyond the black
It comes the eternal lie... Forever ride
And then you crawl me through the
endless night... Devouring inside
And now it's too late for me to fight

The way you touch me
the way you tell me that my name
The way you love me
The way you mercilessly kill... me!!!

I step into the Black
Unable to deny
A sinful feel of lust
Strange, uneasy, unknown
No place for innocence
when heart is pounding fast
Surrender to the call
Under the moon

Torn my soul... Burn my eyes
But i will follow you in the dark
We'll rise... As far as high
beyond the black
It comes the eternal lie... Forever ride
And then you crawl me through the
endless night... Devouring inside
And now it's too late for me to fight
