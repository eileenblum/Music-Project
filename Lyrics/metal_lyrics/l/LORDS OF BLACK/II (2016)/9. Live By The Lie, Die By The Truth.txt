Once... We were close as brothers...
Now we're distant as worlds apart...
Why don't you just take away my pain
I will be fearless cause I will be free

Superstitious and senseless
They will slave you in the name of God
If... there's no chance for freedom
I rather escape to a world of my own

You think I'm a fool for believing
In dreams out reality
But you don't see what's the wind
Carrying to you
In the day of reckoning

Live by the lie, die by the truth
Is this the place... we'll give to our sons
Call to the Land... that was torn in two
They show no mercy to those who refuse
Dust from the stars what only we'll be
Don't ever wonder if no one forgives

Is it real what I'm seeing thru
Or just the eyes are deceiving you
All the seeds we created for good
They're all now wasted and cursed by the hate

If no one can hear
What the Gods we believe in are crying out
Then maybe is the time for the end of the Kingdom
We never deserved

Live by the lie, die by the truth
Is this the place... we'll give to our sons
Call to the Land... that was torn in two
They show no mercy to those who refuse
Dust from the stars what only we'll be
Don't ever wonder if no one forgives

You think I'm a fool for believing
In dreams out reality
But you don't see what's the wind
Carrying to you
In the day of reckoning

Live by the lie, die by the truth
Is this the place... we'll give to our sons
Call to the Land... that was torn in two
They show no mercy to those who refuse
Dust from the stars what only we'll be
Don't ever wonder if no one forgives
