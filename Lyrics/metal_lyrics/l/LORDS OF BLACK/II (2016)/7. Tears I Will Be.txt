When different worlds turn cold with sorrow
Silent but deadly inside you
And the winds that will blow tomorrow
You know crash and burn will follow

I wish I could be the one I used to be
I need to remember how... it was to feel
Never afraid by no one down the road
Until I found the things... can't be undone

Inside my dreams
Always relentless... the voice of fear
Evil tries to pull me under

The more it seems real
The deeper I may fall eternally
I need to find peace in your eyes

Don't wanna be alone in the rain
I need you to defeat my despair

Don't let me fall in my evilness
You are the one I need to pretend

As long as I can see in the black
I wanna be your light in the dark

If all we had was not meant to be
Forever cry the tears I will be

I hope I can find a meaning for the rage
Different ways of pain out on the edge
Before my heart begins to show the cracks
Will unfold the secrets of my life

Into the unknown
Crawling so deep down the memories
Feeling like all I knew was wrong within

Trying to find
Pieces of me out of broken dreams
I need to find peace in your eyes

Inside my dreams
Always relentless... the voice of fear
Evil tries to pull me under

The more it seems real
The deeper I may fall eternally
I need to find peace in your eyes
