I still remember once a proud boy far from home
The fighter and the gambler... A rogue with a spell and joy

Bad reputation they said he could never die
But now is the needle turning his heart and mind in black

And when the stars are falling
Tearing out my soul
A broken hero that can't take it anymore

When devil rules the game
Repent before the fall
Now take me to the place where I will cry no more

The brave and fearless cowboy
Got lost by the evil lies
A renegade who was
Defeated and overcome

He's running out of alibis
To get thru another day

He needs the rush one last time
Before comes the hell to pay

And when the stars are falling
Tearing out my soul
A broken hero that can't take it anymore

Are you out there?
I really need you now

I want to believe I can give it up
But I guess it will never set me free

And when the stars are falling
Tearing out my soul
A broken hero that can't take it anymore
