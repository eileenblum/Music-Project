Behind a heavy fog
Hiding from what I love
I hear a distant voice fragile and weak
I pay for my mistakes
Now and every single day
I have to find you somewhere in time

What can I do
I'm just another liar
A simple cheating won't make up this time

Now you tell me how can I reach you
No matter what I have to carry away
And now that I walk through fire and water
Is moment to rise and use my last trick

See... wonders and secrets
Burning my broken soul
Don't let me fall
You... smoke and mirrors
Feel that I've failed you
Don't let me go

Dreams
Now for one last time
I can't stop loving you
Don't leave me alone
You... smoke and mirrors
I will be back to you
The way to see you again

What can I do
I'm just another liar
A simple cheating won't make up this time

Now you tell me how can I reach you
No matter what I have to carry away
And now that I walk through fire and water
Is moment to rise and use my last trick
