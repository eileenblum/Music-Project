It came out of nowhere behind us
Riding the waves in the dark
You better hold fast
Finding a new place to hide
If we want to see out this night
We'll must slip into darkness
And just pray the Lord for a chance

In the shadows I hear your name
In the dark I'll reach for the sky

This time I'll play the hunter
Blessed by the winds of the storm
No shelter around
Surrounded by demons and crawls
I'll have you at reach for my guns
You'll be my indefense pray now
Soon you'll be forever gone

Through the black deep into the unknown
When you hear the cries of the world
And you pray for an eclipse of the sun
With the black rain I'll come for you
In the fire we burn

Gods of the storm,
Show me the colours we run
Here and now
Let me fly over the night
Send you down
Under waters that roar
Screaming out
Here at the end of the world

In the shadows I hear your name
In the dark I'll reach for the sky
In this fire we burn

Gods of the storm,
Show me the colours we run
Here and now
Let me fly over the night
Send you down
Under waters that roar
Screaming out
Here at the end of the world
