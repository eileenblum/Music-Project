Trying to leave the past behind
Never had the words to say
Where the pieces of a broken life
Still burning

I remember you and I
When the moon rose higher
Golden dreams now turning into
Sadness

Now you're lonely and still no guilt inside
What you want from me now that
I am helpless

Like the Eagle when she rides
Against the wind
Running through the chapters to my darkest days
I can't give you what I was told not to give
I forgive but I can not forget you

Many things have changed along the way
But we never stay too close to feel
Love or hate
Just promises... not meant to be
Where did it all go wrong?
Just tell me why

Like the Eagle when she rides
Against the wind
Running through the chapters to my darkest days
I can't give you what I was told not to give
I forgive but I can not forget you

Now you're lonely and still no guilt inside
Where did it all go wrong?

Now you tell me why

Like the Eagle when she rides
Against the wind
Running through the chapters to my darkest days
I can't give you what I was told not to give
I forgive but I can not forget you
