In the shadows I run
I will chase you at nightfall
Soon you will be so helpless
When it's dark, when it's black

I'm the mirror you can't lie
No one will hear you screaming
No more twist of reality
Now I'm breaking the silence

Fear is what you're feeling now
Desperate you're crying out
Endless lies behind your eyes
You can't reach out from my hands

I will be the law and right
We'll turn every tear and cry
We will take your soul and heart
We're the Lords of Black

From a bloodline divine
And a new reign of fire
Came the tempest and justice
For you all
With no warning!

I can reach out and break you
Anytime, at my will
I'm the whip of deceivers
Pray your maker and cry

Fear is what you're feeling now
Desperate you're crying out
Endless lies behind your eyes
You can't reach out from my hands

"Two hundred and ten counts of fraud and extortion,
Eight hundred and forty nine counts of racketeering,
Forty nine counts of conspiracy murder...
...How does the defendant plead?

I'm the mirror you can't lie
No one will hear you screaming
No more twist of reality
Now I'm breaking the silence

Fear is what you're feeling now
Desperate you're crying out
Endless lies behind your eyes
You can't reach out from my hands
