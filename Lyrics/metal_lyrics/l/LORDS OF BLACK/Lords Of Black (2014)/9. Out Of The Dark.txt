It was late at night when it hit my heart
And for the first time I just knew
You're not coming back

Wish I had you here... by my side
And for a last one kiss I'd give all I ever had

You, you were the only place where
I could rest my soul apart
But now, in the darkest night
There's no home for me anymore

Now it's raining in the night
Those were the tears from my eyes
I couldn't take away the pain
No matter how hard I tried
You waited for me in the darkness
Calling out my name
I'm finally here and you slip away
To be free

Came back where I was born
Just to realise
How bad I'll miss the love
I'll never knew in my life

I had no nightmares when
You embraced me with your arms at night
But now in this darkest night
My desperate cry is a prayer for you

Now it's raining in the night
Those were the tears from my eyes
I couldn't take away the pain
No matter how hard I tried
You waited for me in the darkness
Calling out my name
I'm finally here and you slip away
To be free

Now it's raining in the night
Those were the tears from my eyes
I couldn't take away the pain
No matter how hard I tried
You waited for me in the darkness
Calling out my name
I'm finally here and you slip away
To be free
