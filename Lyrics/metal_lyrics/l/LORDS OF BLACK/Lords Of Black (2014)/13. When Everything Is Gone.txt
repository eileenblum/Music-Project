I close my eyes... and you're still inside
Deep in my memories

How long can I still keeping my faith
When every thing is falling down
Visions of you
Fall upon my eyes
Even in my darkest nights

Used to be a hero
Now a broken man
I'll have to find my way

Everything is gone
Find another reason to hold on to
Promises and dreams from
Another love
Reaching out and filling your heart

Somehow you were my
Way to believe
In everything that I could be
Black winds of fire
Took you away from me
And nothing's gonna save me

Yesterdays are gone now
They'll not come again
But I still have my dreams

When everything is gone
Find another reason to hold on to
Promises and dreams from
Another love
Reaching out and filling your hear

Make me recall who I was once
When you were my day and night
Lost in a world where I am
Out of sight

Everything is gone
Find another reason to hold on to
Promises and dreams from
Another love
Reaching out and filling your heart

And coming from the rain
You came into my life like a
Saving grace
Rescue me from this lonely
World of mine
Tell me I won't cry anymore
