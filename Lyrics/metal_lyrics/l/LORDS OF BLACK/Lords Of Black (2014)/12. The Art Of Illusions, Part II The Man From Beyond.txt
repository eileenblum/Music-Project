Like a flash light I will come
Blinding the wise and the fool
Invading your privacy and soul

You don't know me but I am
The one you can see in your dreams
Carried to you by the fate

I want to heal your agony
And cure your pain and tragedy
I want you to surrender
Release you from the sleep

Now the midnight hour has come
And you'll see the power I have
When no one is safe from my rage
Through the darkness and the haze
I'll show you the place where she is
Waiting for you to come home

I want to heal your agony
And cure your pain and tragedy
I want you to surrender
Release you from the sleep

You take my hand
Come to a place where's no cry and pain
You can trust in me
Now close your eyes
Erasing the fear and your suffering
You're the man from beyond

You take my hand
Come to a place where's no cry and pain
You can trust in me
Now close your eyes
Erasing the fear and your suffering
You're the man from beyond
