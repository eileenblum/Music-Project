So they say there is love
True, and deep as the blue sea
But all I can recall is painful stings from you

You're my greatest obsession
I'm your way to damnation
If we can't have what others call love
Then let's make the ultimate sin

As we're heading for the unknown
Falling down into the dark
I surrender to your poison
Now I see it through your eyes

Can't stop the unholy love
Wonder if we've crossed the line
Getting so close to the edge
Of Madness in this game we play

Now the thunder is gone
And the rain fills your heart
But the more it hurts the more
That you keep coming back

Is too late for a last chance?
Will we ever forgive us?
Now were desperate falling
Into the eye of the storm

As we're heading for the unknown
Falling down into the dark
I surrender to your poison
Now I see it through your eyes

As we're heading for the unknown
Falling down into the dark
I surrender to your poison
Now I see it through your eyes
