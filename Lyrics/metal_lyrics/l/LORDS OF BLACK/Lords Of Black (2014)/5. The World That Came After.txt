Far away from a place once called home
In a desperate piece of waste land
Fight to remember my name
I will have to survive to defend them

It was so many years ago
When you came with the unholy fathers
Ready to stain the heaven
Like a bunch of snakes in Eden
Destroying every sign of life
But I will never leave you

Is it real or just a dream
Unbroken love for eternity
I will come for you
To save you from this sadness

No more shadows of the past
As long as I fight to keep you alive
Angels from the world that
Came after the war

Coming out from the black hole
They were programmed to kill us
Lightning the sky with fire
With a merciless rage and evil

I'll hold this sacred ground for you
I will never leave you

Is it real or just a dream
Unbroken love for eternity
I will come for you
To save you from this sadness

May I escape out of the dark
Haunted by the dreams at night
When the whole world will become a ruined place... yeah!

Destroying every sign of life
But I will never leave you

Is it real or just a dream
Unbroken love for eternity
I will come for you
To save you from this sadness
