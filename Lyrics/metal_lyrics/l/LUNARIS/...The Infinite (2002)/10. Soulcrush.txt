Draped between white-light morality and field of intellectual freedom
Torn between the deceitful safety of the past and simplistic chaos of  future
On his knees praying to an illusion he never believed, his confusion self-evident
His fragile mortal soul not able to carry the weight of the truth

He samples the freedom beyond the cross
Neither dark nor light
Mental equilibrium in prolific chaos

Mesmerized by the jewel beset ceiling
The night sky holds all answers

A quickening of his conceptions yields key to the door of unbounded possibilities
The deafening sound of universal secrets, expose the frailties of his past

He samples the freedom beyond the cross
Neither dark nor light
Mental equilibrium in prolific chaos

No longer able to hide behind the cross, he finally finds himself
A truth not meant for all, the strong prevail to new heights of perception
The evidence of the enlightenment not visible to the feeble flock
Stepping from their presence, leaving only a veil of confusion
