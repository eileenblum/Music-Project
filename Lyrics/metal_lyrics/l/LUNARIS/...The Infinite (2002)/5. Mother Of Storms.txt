Liquid metal channeled in massive curves
Turbulent orbits thrown of tracks in layers
Carbon clouds swallow the light
As chaotic patterns emerge

A towering helix obscures the trembling horizon
Whirling in torrents absorbing the surrounding energy
Paragon turbulence expanding in symmetric branches
Embracing landscapes of glass

Fractals curling sideways in triumphant scales
Twisting matter into avid form
Structural perfection in seeming randomness
Feeding of external provocations

A towering helix obscures the trembling horizon
Whirling in torrents absorbing the surrounding energy
Paragon turbulence expanding in symmetric branches
Embracing landscapes of glass

The helix sinks into oblivion
leaving the landscapes of glass behind
Silent plains of cold debris
Echoing the sector's...collapse

Pantheon of emptiness
Left in dust
