Creation - God?
Creation severely flawed

A whisper at sunset, a course upon the stars
A modern man created, unique from the start
A black form emerges, hollow in it's form 
Spreading wings of darkness beyond the reach of dawn

Twisting, tangling
Strangled, how?
God, mercy
Nowhere now?

Morality, ancient apply
Godhood - falsehood, intelligence implies
Truth, Clarity, comes when
All is forsaken, only then

Awareness injected into lifeless inanimate matter
Corporeal structures reveal rationality
The curse has gone, Christ is left undone
The modern man arises from the ashes of religion

Fields of matter merging
Entities combine
Neural paths revealing that
Identity entwine

I construct my reality from what I was meant to be
Inside the provocateurs mind, there lies all there is to find

Giving in, blessed from centuries of sin
Unconprehendable life, deconstruct in death
The burden of existence lays now upon man
The concept of God is erased, and left out of the chain of command
Unconprehendable life, deconstruct in death

I construct my reality from what I was meant to be
Inside the provocateurs mind, there lies all there is to find

Creation - God?
Creation severely flawed
