Worlds do divide, split and part
Accused are those who led

Revolt, malice, disturbing scenes
Weak individuals pulling strings
Nailed to ground, growth denied
Forced to feed on serpents pray 

Vail dominion dethroned by rage
Poetic clowns dissect world - control

Frenzied machine confusion proliferate
Dissolved fractions of consciousness
Constrained minds a pray of ease

Blazon, divulge, make it known
To the anemic, ashen, the mass of gray

Rise, resist 
Growth, denied 
Worlds divide
Growth, denied

Revolt, malice, disturbing scenes
Weak individuals pulling strings
Nailed to ground, growth denied
Forced to feed on serpents pray

Frenzied machine confusion proliferate
Dissolved fractions of consciousness
