In the spirit...of evolution
The undeniable failure...of your quest
The constant struggle...to antagonize
Our predetermined path

You plead for pacification
When our vicious immure dominates
Your postulate...benevolence
I deliver...Vengeance

If you wish peace...prepare for War!
A declaration of inconsistency 
A birth right suppressed
If you wish peace...prepare for War!

Your revolting quest for weakness
I reveal in humanities true nature
destroyer of worlds
impeccable decease
destroyer of worlds

Denial will carry you to your final breath
But as life abates, the truth unravels

destroyer of worlds
impeccable decease
destroyer of worlds

Your see your crowning accomplishment
A rotting corpse, an atonement to the earth I destroy....

If you wish peace...prepare for War! 
If you wish peace...prepare for War!
