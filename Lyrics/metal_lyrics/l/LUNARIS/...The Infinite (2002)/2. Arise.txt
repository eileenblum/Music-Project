Angels falling like dead leaves
A divine misfortune
To mankind's best interest
A fall of white light deception, arise for humanity!

I broke the wings of the angel on my shoulder 
And I will destroy the earth
Thus resurrect in my own image

God did not create man
Man created God

Fire walk with me to my sanctuary
Re-light the apocalyptic blaze
Implementation of destructive power

I am the killer you want to be
I am the end of all you can see
I am the essence of humanity
I am the killer you want to be
