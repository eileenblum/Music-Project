BARBARIANS ARE COMING
CRAWLING FROM THE EAST,
(WITH THEIR) EYES WIDE SHUT
AND NOSTRILS FULL OF LONGING,
EPIC AND POWERFUL,
WILD IN A GROUP,
BARBARIANS ARE COMING
FROM THE EAST.
THEY'LL COME OUT OF NOWHERE,
THEY'LL ENTER YOUR STATE,
THE NATION OF LOSERS,
THE TRIBE FULL OF HATE.
WITH KNIVES IN THEIR POCKETS
AND BOMBS IN THEIR HANDS,
THEY'LL BURN DOWN YOUR CITIES
AND YOUR DISNEYLANDS.

[Choir:]
BARBARIANS ARE COMING, HEADING YOUR WAY.
THE EVIL IS RISING, KNEEL DOWN AND PRAY.

WITH THIRD WORLD HUNGER,
SEX DRIVE IN THEIR BRAINS,
THEY'LL WHISPER YOUR NAMES
AND SCREAM IN YOUR FACE.
WHEN THEY SEARCH FOR THEIR SPACE,
THEY'LL TURN INTO SNAKES,
AND YOU'RE BETTER OFF DEAD
IF THEY CRAWL IN YOUR BED.

[Choir:]
BARBARIANS ARE COMING, HEADING YOUR WAY.
THE EVIL IS RISING INTO YOUR DAY.
BARBARIANS ARE COMING, HEADING YOUR WAY.
THE EVIL IS RISING, KNEEL DOWN AND PRAY.

THEY'LL CONQUER YOUR COUNTRY
AND MAKE YOU ALL SLAVES,
THEY'LL BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSES
AND RAVE AT YOUR GRAVES.
YOU'D BETTER GET READY,
YOU'D BETTER BEWARE.
BANGING AT YOUR WINDOWS,
BARBARIANS ARE HERE

[Choir:]
BARBARIANS ARE COMING, HEADING YOUR WAY.
THE EVIL IS RISING, KNEEL DOWN AND PRAY.
BARBARIANS ARE COMING, HEADING YOUR WAY.
WHATEVER YOU TOOK FROM THEM -
NOW YOU WILL PAY
