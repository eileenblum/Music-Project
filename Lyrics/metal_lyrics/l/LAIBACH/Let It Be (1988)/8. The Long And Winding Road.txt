[Originally performed by The Beatles]

The long and winding road,
That lead to your door
Will never disappear,
I've see that road before.
It's always leads me here -
Leads me to your door.

The while and windy night,
That a rain washed a way,
Has left a pool of tears,
Crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here,
Let me know the way.

Many time I've been along
And many time I've cried,
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried.

But still they lead me back,
To the long winding road,
Don't leave me standing here,
Lead me to your door.

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road,
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting you,
Lead me to your door.
