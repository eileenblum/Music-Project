[Originally performed by The Beatles]

Your lips are sweet and lovely, girl,
I love you.
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl,
It's true.
I love you more than ever girl I do.

I want you in the morning, girl,
I love you.
I want you at the moment
I feel blue
And ever ev'ry moment girl to you.

I want you from the moment
I saw you.
You looked at me - that's all you
Had to do.
I feel it how I hope you feel to do.

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl,
I love you.
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl,
It's true.
I love you more than ever girl I do.
