[Originally performed by The Beatles]

Word are flowing out like and less rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they sleep across the Univerce.
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting to my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai guru deva, oh,
Nothin' gonna change my world,
Nothin' gonna change my world,
Nothin' gonna change my world,
Nothin' gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million suns,
They call me on and on across the Univerce.
Thoughts me under like a restlifies wind inside a letter box,
They tumble blindy as they make their way across the Univerce.

Sound of laughter shades of Earth are
Ringing through my open view inciting and inviting me,
Limitless undying, love which shines aroun'me like a million eyes,
It calls me on and on across the Univerce,
