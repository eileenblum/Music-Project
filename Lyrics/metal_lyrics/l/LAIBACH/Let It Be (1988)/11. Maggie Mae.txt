[Traditional]

Dirty Robin Maggie Mae,
Did I've taken here the way
And she never walked down lounch beat anymore?
Oh, the Church he quilly pounder,
Robin at home a bound,
That dirty noke Robin Maggie Mae.

Disapart of a little pew,
The edit turn me too,
Took part ten a week there was my pay.

All songs by The Beatles.
Produced by Laibach.
