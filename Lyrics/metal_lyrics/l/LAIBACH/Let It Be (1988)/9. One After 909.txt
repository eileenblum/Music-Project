[Originally performed by The Beatles]

My baby says she's the one
After 9-0-9
I said move over honey,
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice,
I said I'm trav'ling on one after 9-0-9

I begged her not to go
And I begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around,
You're fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice,
I said I'm trav'ling on one after 9-0-9.

I've got my beg, run to the station,
Then I said you've got a number wrong,
I've got my beg, run right home,
Then I find I've got a number wrong.

Well, I said I'm traveling on one
After 9-0-9
I said move over honey,
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice.
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm trav'ling on one after 9-0-9.

I've got my beg, run to the station,
Then I said you've got a number wrong,
I've got my beg, run right home.
Then I find I've got a number wrong

Well, I said I'm traveling on one
After 9-0-9,
I said move over honey,
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice,
I said I'm trav'ling on one after 9-0-9.
I said I'm traveling on one
After 9-0-9...
