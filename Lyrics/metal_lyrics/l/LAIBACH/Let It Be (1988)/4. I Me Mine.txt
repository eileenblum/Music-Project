[Originally performed by The Beatles]

All thru' the day I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
All thru' the night I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Nobody're frightened of leaving it,
Ev'ryone weaving it,
Coming on strong all the time,
All thru' the day I me mine.
I-I me-e mine, I-I me-me mine,
I-I me-e mine, I-I me-me mine.

All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine,
Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Noone's frightened of playing it,
Ev'ryones saying it,
Flowing more fredy than wine.
Al thru' your life I me mine.
