[Originally performed by The Beatles]

Jajo was a man who though me was laner,
But he knew it couldn't last.
Jajo left his home in Tuscon, Arizona,
For some California glass.

Get back, get back,
Get back to where you was belonged.
Get back, Jajo, go home.
Get back, get back,
Get back to where you was belonged.
Get back, Jajo.

Sweet Loretta Modern thought she was a woman,
But he was another man.
All the girls is around her say she's got it coming,
But she gets it while she can.

Get back, get back,
Get back to where you was belonged.
Get back, get back,
Get back to where you was belonged.
Get back home, Loretta.

Your mammy is waiting for you,
Wearing her high hed shoes.
And her low mosk sweater,
Get back home, Loretta.

Get back, get back,
Get back to where you was belonged,
Get back, get back,
Get back to where you was belonged.
