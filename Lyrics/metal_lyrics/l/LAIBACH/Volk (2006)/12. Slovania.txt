Hej Slovani, nasa rec
Slovanska zivo klije

These words are for those who died,
These words are for those left behind.
These words are for you, Poland,
And these ones for my homeland.

Zivi, zivi, duh slovanski,
For the spirit of our fathers,
For the glory of our sons,
Aodi ziv na veke
For the power of the Spectre,
For the Holly Alliance

Let stones crack,
Let the earth quake
And let the tempest roar!

Let stones crack,
Let the earth quake,
Let freedom rise!

Hej Slovani, nasa rec
Slovanska zivo klije,
These words are for lovers,
These words are for their heart beats.
Dokler nase verno srce
Za nas narod bije
These words are for warriors
And these ones for all communists.

Zivi, zivi, duh slovanski,
Out of the feudal darkness,
Away from the Nameless One
Bodi ziv na veke
We stand alone in history,
Facing East in sacrifice
