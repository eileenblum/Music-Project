Arise,
You who refuse to be slaves!
With our flesh and blood
Let us build
Our new Great Wall!

The Chinese people
Has come to its time
Of greatest peril,
And everyone must send out
A final roar!

Arise! Arise! Arise!

Qilai! Women wanzhongyixin,
Qilai! Women wanzhongyixin

We are millions,
But of one heart.
Brave the enemy's gunfire,
March on!
Brave the enemy's gunfire,
March on!

March on!
March on!
March on!
And on and on and on!
