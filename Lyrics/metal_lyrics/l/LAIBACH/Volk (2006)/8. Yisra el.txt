As long as deep in the heart
A Jewish soul still yearns,
And forward to the east,
To Zion, an eye still looks,
Our hope will not be lost,
The hope of two thousand years,
'Od lo avdah tikvatenu
Hatikvah bat shnot alpayim:
To be a free nation in our own home-land,
The land of Zion and Jerusalem.

Lihyot am chofshi be'artzenu -
Eretz Tziyon vi'rushalayim.

My country, my country, my land,
My ancestors!
My country, my country, my nation,
In the land of struggle!

With determination, fire
Kol'od balevav P'nimah -
And my volcanic revenge,
I hove climbed the mountains,
Crossed frontiers
Nefesh Yehudi homiyah
And fought the wars.

I've conquered the impossible,
With longing in my blood
Ulfa'atey mizrach kadimah
And the roar of gems,
For my country, my land, my home,
Ayin le'tzion tzofiyah - -
My ancestors
