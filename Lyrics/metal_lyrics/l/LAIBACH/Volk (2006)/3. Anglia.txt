So, you still believe you are ruling the World,
Using all your tricks to keep the picture blurred,
Scatter your enemies,
Confound their politics,
So you still believe you are ruling the World!

God save your gracious Queen,
Long live your noble Queen,
God save your gracious Queen,
God save you all.

So you still believe you are superior,
And all other nations are inferior,
Any sedition - bushed,
Rebellious Scots - crushed,
So you still believe you are superior!

So, you still pretend you are ruling the World,
Using all your tricks to keep the picture blurred.
So, you still pretend you are ruling the World,
Using all your tricks to keep the picture blurred
