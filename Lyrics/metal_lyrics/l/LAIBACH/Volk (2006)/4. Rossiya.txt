United forever in vast, endless space,
Created in struggle by unhappy race,
Where sunrays of freedom
Are frozen in ice,
United forever in Great Russia's embrace.

From the Arctic Circle to the southern seas,
Deserted forests, never-ending steppes,
The unbreakable union
Of fraternal states,
United forever in Great Russia's embrace.

Slav'sya Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Slav'sya strana! My gordimsya toboy!

Arise, prisoners of starvation,
Arise, the damned of the earth,
Let's gather together,
Let's break us free,
The world is changing at its core!

Long live Great Russia's motherland,
Built by the people and their mighty hand,
Long live your nation,
United and free,
Shining in glory for all man to see.
