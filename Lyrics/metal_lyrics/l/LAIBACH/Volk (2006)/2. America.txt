O, the land of the free
And the home of the brave,
Are your stars still so bright,
Does your banner still wave?

O, the land of the free
And the home of the brave,
Are you heaven on Earth
Or the gloom of the grave?

You, the people of the United States,
Did you form a perfect union,
Establish justice,
Insure tranquility,
Secure the blessings of liberty
To yourselves and your posterity?

How blind can you get
For your country - right or wrong,
America - the melting pot!

Praise the lord
And praise the Holy Spirit
To save us from your freedom,
Justice, peace, accordance and illusion,
From arrogance and pride,
From violence and confusion

Your great despair
And great depression,
Satanic verses of your superstition,
The land of plenty

Your Bill of Rights, the enterprise,
The free will and the unbroken one,
Your self-esteem and self-desire,
Your trust in God and the religious fire.

America -
The end of history,
The end of time,
The end of family,
The end of crime.
