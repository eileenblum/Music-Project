No need to be afraid
When the light start to fade
When minds disintegrate
No need to be afraid

No need, no need to fear
When you begin to hear the bells
Tolling death knells in your ears
Calling you closer to me

I'll set you free

When the temple comes to collect
To harvest your life's account
And your goodness is no defence
Against your family's neglect

Take my hands and follow me
I'll set you free

Between heavenly salvation
And the Serpent's curse
Between eternal abomination
And the boredom of the vertuous
You deeds count for nothing
On the day of reckoning
Your faith stands for nothing
God was only an enterprise

Take my hands and follow me
I'll set you free

Some people say
Death is not the end
Well let me tell you this
Death is your only friend

Death is the final release
From the cycle of misery
From the threat of eternity
And perpetual vanity

Take my hands and follow me
I'll set you free

Death is the final release
From the cycle of misery
From the threat of eternity
From eternal slavern

Take my hands and follow me
I'll set you free...
