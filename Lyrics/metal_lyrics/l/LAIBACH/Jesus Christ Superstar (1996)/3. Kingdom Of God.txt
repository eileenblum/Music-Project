On the last day of God's creation
Blood will flow from stone
Earthquakes will destroy Your nation
And swallow the king's throne
And flood will follow fire
To wash away the stains
So finally He can rest in peace
Now nothing of man remains

In the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God

Now times was man's invention
For regulating his ways
But time has lost its meaning
In cities of eternal days
Ang every city became Godom
Man bore the mark of Cain
Until God raised atomic fire
Now nothing of man remains

In the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God

Now the last traces fade away
Of His creation gone wrong
Fish return to the river
And whales sing their ocean song
The bears roam in the mountains
And buffaloes roam the plains
Eagles fly in freedom
Now nothing of man remains

In the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God

Let silence be the music
That settles on the Earth
And thunder be the rhythm
That drowns man's last words
And let melody be the sound
Of the wind and the lashing rain
Blowing away man's harmonies
Until nothing of him remains

In the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God

So nothing of man remains
In the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God
