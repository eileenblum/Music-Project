I am the storm bringer and the bearer of light
I set up the Nobel prise and invented dynomite
I raised you up after the fall
Without me you would be nothing, nothing at all

I am the builder of Babel, a stairway to Heaven
He replaced the tower with a million nations
And then He told you to love, love one another
Then again He said, fire! brother against brother

He is the dreamer who demands too much
I am the realist, I expect nothing as such
Beware false idols, belive in me
Beware false idols, belive in me

He says I make work for idols hands
That sloth, envy and rage erode time's sand
Plus gluttony, greed, impurity and pride
That makes seven ways to keep Him occupied

He fulfilled every step in my masterplan
When His son upon this earth did crashland
He was my twin, my faithful negative
It was me who really showed Him to live

He is the dreamer who demands too much
I am the realist, I expect nothing as such
Beware false idols, belive in me
Beware false idols, belive in me

Welcome to Hell, you already know my name
For that you have your Lord Jesus Christ to blame
He did my work well, He was my greatest creation
Through Him I spoke to you and to many a nation

It's hard for you with your dying breath
To speak my name ang go into death
Knowing that I and only I am the one

The only one...
