Brother of mine
Do you feel the courage raised by night
For the eternal struggle
For the beauty of the world?

Brother of mine
Rekindle the flame in every man
Let's be strong as warriors, my brother
In the sacred mystery
We are the omen, we are prophecy
We are the loud laughter of life
The flame is the hunger
The hunger that drives
But does not consume us

Brother of mine
Open your eyes
And rise with us
To the new light
