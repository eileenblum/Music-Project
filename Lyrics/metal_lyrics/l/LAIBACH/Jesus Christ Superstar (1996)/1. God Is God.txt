You shall see Hell clear in the sky
You shall see darkness
You shall see good and evil
You shall see city walls crumble and towers fall

God is God
God is God
God

You shall see the Lord of Life and Death
You shall see Heaven in Hell
You shall be blinded by light
You shall see darkness

God is God
God is God
God

You shall see the walls crumble
Walls built of pain
And above the cries of man
Hear one voice saying:

I am Alfa and Omega
The begining and the end
I am the fist and
I am the last

God is God
God is God
God

You shall see Hell
You shall see evil
You shall see darkness
You shall see sorrow
You shall see Death
You shall see God
