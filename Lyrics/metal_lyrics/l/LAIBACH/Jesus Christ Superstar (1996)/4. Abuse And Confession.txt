Lord
Lord
Christ!

You've been
Sacrificed
Crucified
Sanctified
Glorified
Braised

Lord
Lord
God!

You've been
Sacrificed
Bilified
Demonised
Mortified
Shamed

You gave me flesh and blood
And the will and the way
To serve Thee, my Lord
Until Judgement day
It was written in stone
You had a mission to save
Why give me desire
Just to prove I'm depraved?

But were You not tempted, my Lord
When You became flesh?
Did Your desire not rise
At the sound of a woman's breath?

Lord
Lord
Christ!

You've been
Satirised
Sermonised
Scandalised
Terrorised
Cursed

Here I am
Damned
Cursed
Destroyed
It was written in the book
That You must die on the cross
And it was written
That I must betray You
Otherwise man would be lost
Would be lost

What about me?
Don't turn Your back on me

As it was written, so I must do
And this kiss on Your cheek
Proves my love for You

No greater love
Hath no man that I
Who would sacrifice eternity
For one kiss
For humanity
For humanity

Lord
Lord
Christ!

I've been
Satirised
Terrorised
Demonised
Scandalised
Damned

Why me, Lord
Was it because
I was Judas baptised?

Your mission has failed
Your mission has failed
Your mission has failed

You failed the word
