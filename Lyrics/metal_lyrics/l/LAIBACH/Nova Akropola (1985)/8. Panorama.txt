should be clear with the fact
that we are not moving away
from the road that we beat the path for in 48.
That is to say we have our own way,
we always say what is right on this side
and what is not,
and what is right
on the other side
and what is not.
It should be clear to everyone
that we cannot be no ones
appendage of nobody's politics,
that we have our own point of view
and that we know the worth of what
is right and what is not right.
