Come let us prepare
We brothers that are
Joined on this merry occasion;
Let's drink, laugh and sing;
Our wine has a spring,
Here's health to the men of the nation.

The world is in pain
Our secrets to gain
But still let them guess and gaze on;
They'll never divine
The word or the sign
Of free and strong men of the nation.

It's this and it's that
They cannot tell why
So many great men of the nation
Should aprons put on
To make themselves one
With the men who have found their salvation.

Then joined hand in hand
To each other we'll stand
Be merry with bright faces on;
What mortal can boast
So noble a toast
As free and strong men of the nation!
