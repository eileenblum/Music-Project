I fall, I fall!

Nuclear riders who only know
To go back regenerates will
They ride into battle of absence
In the place that parades from the soul

Strange attractors who cannot deny
What is already preordained
Gravity is not God's law
It's what prevents man's fall

I fall, I fall!

Does not know those who have lost faith
Ask what is it, real ??? before
To put yourself outside the range
A profound man's core
Nuclear riders who only know
To go back regenerates will
They ride into battle of absence
In the place that parades from the soul
