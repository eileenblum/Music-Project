Rap it up!

I shine bright and shed light from afar
93 million miles to be explicit
8 light minutes if you're planning a visit
See I'm the big daddy and this is his system
My turn to burn so keep on listening
I give light when all around is dark
Your choice get sparked or mark my remarks
See ice couldn't hold me back
I fall through forty feet in one minute flat
Meet a solar controller, 'cause that what I was meant to be
'Cause I was a mystery
Decade is null
Decade is null!

It's hot, it's hot, it's very hot
I'm burning up now!
Rap it up!
It's bright, it's bright, it's very bright
I'm burning up now!
Decade is null, decade is null, decade is null
Check it out while I burn your skull
I'm burning up now!
Decade is null

Hold and praise your nearest superstar
I shine bright and shed light from afar
93 million miles to be explicit
8 light minutes if you're planning a visit
See I'm the big daddy and this is his system
My turn to burn so keep on listening
I give light when all around is dark
Your choice get sparked or mark my remarks
Decade is null, decade is null, decade is null
Check it out while I burn your skull
I'm burning up now!
Decade is null, decade is null

From one to all, hear this poem and
Try to understand the greatest power known to man
Am I a nuclear bomb, I'm that I make you look like a firecracker
Alpha and Omega, beginning and end
How can you claim I ain't God, my friend
My atomic magnitude is explosive
I could keep a planet in motion or roast it!
Decade is null, decade is null, decade is null
Check it out while I burn your skull

Into the sun!

I emit energy, over all wavelengths
From x-rays to radio waves
Being the most dominant body of the Solar System
I am the Earth Star

I'm burning up now!
Into the sun!
Hold and praise your nearest superstar
Into the sun!
I shine bright and shed light from afar
Into the sun!
93 million miles to be explicit
8 light minutes if you're planning a visit
I'm burning up now!
See I'm the big daddy and this is his system
Into the sun!
My turn to burn so keep on listening
I'm burning up now!
I give light when all around is dark
Your choice get sparked or mark my remarks
Into the sun!
See ice couldn't hold me back
Into the sun!
I fall through forty feet in one minute flat
Into the sun!
Meet a solar controller, 'cause that what I was meant to be
I'm burning up now!
Into the sun!
'Cause I was a mystery
Into the sun!
Into the sun!

Chain of carbon-nitrogen
Witness the power of chains
Into the sun!
Everything dies in fiery heat
Everything dies in fiery heat
I'm burning up now!
Everything dies in fiery heat
Everything dies in fiery heat... of the sun

I emit energy, over all wavelengths
From x-rays to radio waves
Being the most dominant body of the Solar System
I am the Earth Star
