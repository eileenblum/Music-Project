I wandered through life for a long time, as though in twilight
I followed the infinite dreams and foggy desires

Aspired to somewhere, where exactly I didn't know
Was searching for something, what exactly I didn't know

My feelings were carrying my mind away
The passion to know consumes my reason

Pain and aggression and again infinite dreams
And then oblivion, from fuss I ran away

Flash in consciousness
As if a bright light
On the verge of life
Enlightened me like a star

Mysterious and invisible
Like a star
Far and close
As my illusive dream
Illuminated my reason

She told me:
Man, you are only a seed
Of a sacred flower
Wherein the secret of a future
Is hidden
Thrown in a dark silt
Of passions
Under dark waters
Of feelings
But...

Night... comes to an end
A lake shore...
The fog... is rambling through
A silence...

The last stars are reflecting
In water
The first shiver of a day...
A pressure...

Some force pushes me upwards
I see nothing through thickness
Of dark waters
It's hard to breath
I am tired
But the bottom is further and further
So heaven meets me
This is my birth

Now I am not a seed
Of a sacred flower
Wherein the secret of the future
It is hidden
Thrown in a dark silt
I have sprouted through dark waters
Now I am a lotus flower
That opened to sky the secret of future
At sunrise
I am a light, I am a star
And this is evolution
