In peace and silence of thought
I will ask myself "What are you looking for?"
When everything you need is already with you
Only tranquillity

I will follow the path on my bare feet
Through the meadows of human disgrace
No matter will I find no matter will I lose
It will be dispersed like an ash in the space

I will free my soul from shackles insanity
From reflections casting a gloom over me
I let go the dark times of my life in serenity
Feeling only my heartbeat that shows me my way

No need of something more
No need of something less
No need event? Breathe more that I breathe

The power, the glory, the vanity
Will melt like a snow in the cover of eternity
Being only the dew that covers the grass
