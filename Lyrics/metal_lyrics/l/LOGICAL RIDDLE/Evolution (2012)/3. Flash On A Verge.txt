Life lasts like an instant
When youâre on a verge
Illumination of spirit comes, eyes see truth
Actions, thoughts and words
All youâve got in your life
You understand that almost all was wrong

Youâre cause and effect.
And you made a choice.
Every second, and every moment.
Your life was in your hands
Now you canât change yourself
Just pain ahead, the flash on a verge

The future is unknown
And youâre ashamed by past
Fear and despair, anger and rage. You cry
Errors of mind and heart
They will to get back
But why must you die to understand?

Youâre cause and effect.
And you made a choice.
Every second, and every moment.
If life will be in your hands
Think above actions
Which were prompted by the flash on a verge
