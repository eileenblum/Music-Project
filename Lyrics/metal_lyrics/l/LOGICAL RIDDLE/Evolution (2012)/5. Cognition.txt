Barefooted you are facing the Infinity
Gazing into its unexplored depths
Thoughts and feelings melt in eternal dark
You bring back all the Earth gifted you with
Just to know the secret of the sky

Searching neither for words nor for passion
Sacrificing your quietness instead
With eternal hope you are looking
And waiting for answer from the Silence

Centuries pass by before your eyes
Faces are flickeringâ¦ machines are roaring
Buildings had being erected and destroyed
But you stand still in patience

Moment in infinity of the wheel of time
And secret reveals for you
You can see veracityâ¦
And only whispering from core of your heart

âNor Aught nor Nought existed; yon bright sky
Was not, nor heavenâs broad roof outstretched above.
What covered all? What sheltered? what concealed?
Was it the waterâs fathomless abyss?
There was not deathâyet there was nought immortal,
There was no confine betwixt day and night;

The only One breathed breathless by itself,
Other than It there nothing since has been.
Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled
In gloom profoundâan ocean without light

Tired wanderer of eternity
Your path leads to infinity
To walk and to stay
Action in the slackness
And search forever more
