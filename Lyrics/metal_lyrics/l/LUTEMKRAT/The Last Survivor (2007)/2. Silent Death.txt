Feel the pain and sorrow
Fall into the abyss

Silent death

Laid down
Cursed to dwell
Beneath a black haze
Through eternity

Silent death

Cold blood now run through your veins
Drowning in grief
You choose loneliness
There's no return

Falling
Dead and forgotten

Open your eyes
(there's) nothing to see
Shades in black
No turning back

Rotting
Dead and forgotten

Nothingness
Non-existence
Absence of light
Denying all the lies

Embrace the darkness
Face the death
Emptiness is all you have

Silent death
