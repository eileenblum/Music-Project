Warriors will fight
Many shall die
Blood on their minds
The frost begins to rise

The war is declared
None shall survive
Now the warriors
Are fighting at night

Standing on the front
Lusting for blood
The battlefield is red
Waiting to attack

The war is declared
None shall survive
Now the warriors
Are fighting at night

No more feelings
No more hope
Only anger
Makes them strong

No more feelings
No more hope
Only anger
Makes them strong

Now it's time to kill
Kill everyone
All the enemies shall die
Vengeance shall be done
