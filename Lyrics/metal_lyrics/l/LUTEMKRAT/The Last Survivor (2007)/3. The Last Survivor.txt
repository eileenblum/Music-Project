A river of blood is flowing
Warriors are down at the battlefield
The war is so near
Vengeance is here
The future is feared

The icy morning proclaims
The eternal pain
The final battle is coming
To destroy the enemy

The strength of the sword
Forged by fire
Will silence the voice
Of one thousand words

The taste for victory
Grows inside hearts
Everyman for himself
There is no remorse
Fighting for life
Fighting to survive
Fight until death
Or be tortured alive

A river of blood is flowing
Warriors are down at the battlefield

The war is so near
Vengeance is here
The future is feared

The soil is his nest
The forget the past
He can't be the last

The soil is his nest
To forget the past
He can't be the last

Last survivor
Lone warrior
