Hundreds of humans killed
Hundreds of corpses among the fields
Inside, you're screaming
Suffering in agony
Another warrior is found
Bleeding to death
A dying victim of war

Grieving over the dead
While men dig graves
For those who have been killed
By the enemies hands

Another warrior is found
Bleeding to death
A dying victim of war

Hundreds of humans killed
Hundreds of corpses among the field
Inside, your screaming
Suffering in agony

Grieving over the dead
