In a landscape of forests
I walk with my misery
Like a dream
I feel winter's infinity

Silent winds, storming skies
Every day, every night
Where life is out of sight

When the cold rain falls
On a winter's night
I still hear voices
Haunting my mind

Despair clouds
Which blind my eyes
Also darken my soul
Are my feelings now gone?

Despair clouds
Which blind my eyes
Also darken my soul
Are my feelings now gone?

Living with the loss
Farther than eyes can see
I walk this path
Where no one shall reach

Rise...
Beyond this world

Forget the fragments
And breathe the new essence

My pale soul now wanders
Through a distant path
