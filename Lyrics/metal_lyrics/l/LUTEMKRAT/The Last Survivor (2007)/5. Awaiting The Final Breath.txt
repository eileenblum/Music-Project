My spirit burn
In a valley of shadows
The fire that surrounds me
Makes me strong

Walking by moonlight
The wind leads me
To where silence reigns
A chamber of sorrow and pain

I cross the gates
Of the unknown realm
Now alone
I will eternally dwell

A burning sphere
Warms my blood
A cosmic dust
Freezes my memories

Awaiting the final breath

My heart
Filled with hatred
My mind runs so cold

A wasteland
Of fire and ice
Where only darkness
Remains

A black flame
Burns my heart
A cold wind
Freezes my soul

Awaiting the final breath

My heart
Filled with hatred
My mind
Runs so cold
A wasteland
Of fire and ice
Where only darkness
Remains

In the land where no human dwells
I await for the final breath
