the pact has undone
a war full of blood will come

by sun light
marching away

hate burning
the time is running
death is coming
the world keeps turning

ready to fight for...
to see enemies on the floor
ready to open death's door
never surrender to the war

I see the sky throwing flame
I feel the pain inside of me
my body full of cuts became
I feel the pain inside again

knight's head was sent
the war will not end

by moonlight
fighting again

hate burning
destruction returning
rage becoming
the war keeps running

ready to fight for...
to see enemies on the floor
ready to open death's door
never surrender to the war

I see the sky throwing flame
I feel the pain inside of me
my body full of cuts became
I feel the pain inside again

all the enemies are on the floor
never surrender to the war
all the chaos and pain
has turned to power and strength
