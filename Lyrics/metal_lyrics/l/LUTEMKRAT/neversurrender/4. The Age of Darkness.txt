the freezing winds blow
feeling the sword
cold as the snow
deep into your soul

grow up you will
and then you'll kill
with sword, iron and steel
the age of darkness will be unreal

the only thing you can hear
is the wind when is near
then it can disappear
and the horizon became clear

the freezing winds blow

grow up you will
and then you'll kill

the age of darkness will be unreal

the only thing you can hear
