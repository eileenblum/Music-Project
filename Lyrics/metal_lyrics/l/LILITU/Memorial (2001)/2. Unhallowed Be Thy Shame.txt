The claims of the living on behalf of the dead
In the clasping of hands, holding on to your breath
With every breath a lie a lie as cold as a death
Proffered kisses and faded flowers
Grazing your lips and bonds as ours
With every word you speak
Your request, my command

Treat me as if I am No one, nothing
Not Born at all
Inevitable, I will keep crawling back to you
I 'm bound to fall

I will fall into oblivion
I've given all
and now I'm broken down and bruised and battered
Torn and tattered weakened by your beauty
That I can't overcome
And I am still bleeding

Hiding behind your veil of empty promises 
On broken vows on behalf of the blind
You reclaim your innocence and guilt now binds us together
Forever and Ever

Unhallowed Be Thy Shame
With Shallow words and hollow eyes
I have given all that's left to give to you
And taken only the suffering you've shown
And the damage done that you've left behind

hate, detest, abhor
All the things that you adore
disfavor, despise
Harvesting such lucid lies

Loathing the empyrean corners that surround my body
And keep me intertwined against the cold hard beating
of your heart
I shall remain a disciple, a giver, never a receiver of truth or forgiveness
Because I am not worthy
I am not worthy of feeling love
Or the pleasant gesture of a smile
Only revealing the damage that you've caused

Unhallowed be thy shame
With shallow words and hollow eyes
I have given all that's left to give to you
And taken only the suffering you've shown
And the damage done that you left behind
