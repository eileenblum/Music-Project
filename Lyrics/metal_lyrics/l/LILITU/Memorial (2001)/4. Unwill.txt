I've tried to find myself, but I can't
To find some peace of mind or what's left
Life seems so meaningless
Sometimes, I just want to give in

As the sorrow calls my name
She comforts me and leaves the scar of pain
and tells me everything will be alright
But I know damn well, that's a lie

Take this day
No different than the others
But I know I cannot stay
Far and away
I'll try not to remember
Still, I remember everything

I am Unwilling, I am unable
I see no hope at all
With all I've given
I can not carry on

Is this forever?
A foul endeavor
Or a veil which I've disclosed

I taste of tragedy and divine
Sweet pathetic comedy
And in time you'll get the best of me
and my mind but it's so insignificant

Will things get better?
In pieces, shattered
Within the lonely corners that the shadows know

It's now or never
No need for reverence
I've paid my debts in full

Things will not get better
I am in pieces, shattered
Slipping into the darkest corner of my mind

Just let me go
Escape from reality
Please don't remember me
I am not worthy of a memory
