Autumn leaves and winter brings
Back dead things that I've tried to hide
All alone, Oh how do I feel?
Only regret, guilt and shame

Nobody's fault but my own
So I have to face it
Try as I may, the pain stays
And I can't erase it

Hold me, In your arms now
Save me, this time around
Hold me, In your arms now
As in my dreams, I hear you scream

These things, they pick away
At my mind that brings the pain
Times since passe, I've tried to erase
Such tragedy torments my weak mind

Nobody's fault but my own
So I have to face it
Try as I may, the pain remains
And I can't take it

A child of your embrace
An empty trail of tears
Upon fallen leaves
Will tomorrow bring

And In my dreams
I hear you laughing
Laughing at me

What we dream and what we see
Forgotten and what used to be
Two indifferent things but never promising
And to you I do confide

I beg of you please
Forgive me

This child of your embrace
An empty trail of tears
Beyond Broken dreams
Will tomorrow be
