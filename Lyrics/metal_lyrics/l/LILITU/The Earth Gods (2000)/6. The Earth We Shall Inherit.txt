At dusk... all is silent and still
Our withered hearts remain the strongest of them all
For they do not know to accept such obedience
Conquering the weak, leaving civilization behind

Rise beneath the sands
...and summon thee in man
...and then you will know our vengeance is real

In a time beyond consciousness...
Rivers ran about their feet
...and their heads rose in majesty
and spoke like distant thunder

Turn the seeds into oceans
To feed the life into others...
Then you will know our vengeance is real!

(To plant the anguish in the heart of man. To drink the blood of the feeble race.)

Their heads rose in majesty above the world
...and swallowed the hills...
They spoke like distant thunder
...and with the winds...
Odors of dead things
The truth of the feeble ones...
The master titans of life

(The scent of burning flesh, sweet and bountiful.
I would breath it
Now and forever...
Thrones, built upon the ashes of generations)

Parched with thirst are the ancients...
My quest to make the cupbeaerer (DEATH!)
Then you will know our vengeance is real
(man is good for the gods!)
