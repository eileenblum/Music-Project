Mother of my chained divinity
Woe upon earth's vain fertility
What sun arose to give me birth?
Had I not a choice?

For you have burdened me with life
Thus I have burdened man
What sun arose to give me birth?
Had I not a choice?

Yesterday, dead yesterday
I have paid suc ha toll just to walk in the shadows...
And with your death, you conceived me deathless
Shall you return with tomorrow
...and wake with life's second dawn and that I may erase your clinging memory from this earth

Through my yesterdays in exile consumed
I died at childbirth to visit her womb.
With slumbering eyes, had they been mine
From a weary heart... I'm banished from time
