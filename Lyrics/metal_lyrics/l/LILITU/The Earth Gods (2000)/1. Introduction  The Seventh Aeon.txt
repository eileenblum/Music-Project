Everything is tied to this day
Until we take the time to look away
As we ask ourselves just "how do we feel?"
...And determine if those dreams were real

Raise your fist and cry to earth
The only shelter that we've known
As once more we reminisce from birth the only seeds we've sown

To close my eyes and then I'll see...
To close my eyes and then I'll see
what thee beholds and then I'm king
Kingdom of ashes and tears that fall...
Tears that fall endlessly

Taste my blade and feel my pain...
A gift you gave that I can't take away
I can't throw away my hate for you
So, I save it for another day...
One which leaves me cold and in shame
I can't throw away my hate for you.

To gather my sorrows with paper and pen
To comfort my soul and die once again
I sleep within the deep of night
And bleed my sorrow with such delight
I can't take away my hate for you...
