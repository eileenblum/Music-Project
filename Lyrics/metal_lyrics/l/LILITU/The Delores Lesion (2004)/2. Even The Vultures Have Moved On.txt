What did you think you would find?
Buried in the dark of the night
Holding you close, wasI blind &amp; naive
Was it that obvious?
Nurture the need to conceal
We are going to lose it all.
Given the chance to prevail, to rise up
But you've crawled into my heart

Given the time &amp; the space
We could escape the enemy
But there's a sense that all hope is gone
On this desolate landscape
The scavengers scale for prety
You offer no reply

Someday you will find your way through time
Someday you will follow secure in something more

Sickly sweet, sinful greed
The leeches stake their claim.
You offer a kiss &amp; a sigh
Go ahead make your bed here of sand &amp; stone
Plant your feet in the soil
Let the fertile seed sink in
The carrion doves, they command us
Beyond the dark horizon

Among the wastelands
Amid the land of broken hearts
It's just the a mound of flesh &amp; bones
That's all we are
The cast of many faces, exalt the process
Now it's done
Even the vultures have moved on
