We made it through September
w/ lust &amp; dying embers
Tell me is that all we were
Now look at what we've done
Look at what we've become
What three words will do

...and you said
I won't be there when you fall
I won't be there when you break down

Dark Haired Girl
where did you go?
you live in a broken world
...and we stand alone
But darling who knew
That when we were created
We'd be suffocated
By such despair &amp; loneliness
Still, we stand as a witness
And die iby the sickness
That this thing called love induces

Dark Haired Girl
Where did you go?
In this broken world
You left me alone
