There's a bruised &amp; broken sky. It's pressed up against us
But odds are there's a heaven burning down below.
The words rise from the north and float there on the wind
Like a soft &amp; subtle whisper
Immortal like a wondrous feeling, so profound...

Leaving the cathedral, angels open the gates.
Reminders for the congregation like judgement day
Attend the keeping of all our glory
The scars cut so deep.
Peering through our souls we've lost our way home...
Stripped of our dignity

Promises mean everything
In a world so cold. Never to be redeemed
Will you suffer?

her lachrymal squander in the distance
For lusts that she waits for so scorn
An image so pale &amp; so pure, yet so beautiful
Her face is plastered on the walls
and it seems so indelible
So unfathomable that we're both lost here

To commence the call &amp; endure the struggle
What a stronghold to face
A command to fall, a condemned prayer
Have you fallen from grace?

Promises mean everything
In a world so cold. Never to be redeemed
Will you suffer?

Redeemer
