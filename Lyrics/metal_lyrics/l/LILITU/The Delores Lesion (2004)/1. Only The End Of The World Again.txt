I feel the needle. It breaks the skin
It's the end of all
I feel the walls, they are closing in
It's the end of all

Everything just falls apart
Feels like the end

I've been in this same place before
Seems so familiar
It's the end of all
Lying face down. I'm on the floor
The morning after
It's the end of all

Everything just falls apart
Feels like the end
