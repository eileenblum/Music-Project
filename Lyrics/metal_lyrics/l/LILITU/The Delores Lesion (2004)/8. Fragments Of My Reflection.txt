If I could be someone, I'd play the fool
W/ broken glass &amp; shattered dreams
To gather up my memories of you
Failure sets in these wounds
....and I'm torn apart inside this time
What's real draws to a close
A reflection of all I've done wrong

I'm not the man I used to be
I need grief &amp; misery to set me free
Half of me is dead and gone

Of all I've ever tried to be
Reveals what I don't want to see
Fragments are all I have to document this life
(Picking up the pieces)

Look away not to face the guilt &amp; the shame
...that weighs me down

I'm haunted by what resides inside
Or what hides behind my soul
Striving to find the core
The face appears in the mirror
The flaws &amp; all the signs of age
Fragmented scenes from a memory
Struggling to find my own identity

Look away not to face the guilt &amp; the shame
...that weighs me down
