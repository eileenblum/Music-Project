as you grew older
then you get colder
I know the world ain't lying
believe what you want about me
I perceive everyone is against me

one day at a time, I'll make everything I ever wanted mine
nothing out of reach, I'll break my back to live out these dreams
just set in stone something that I have never known

through hunger and determination
I have earned whats rightfully mine

you couldn't see the world through my eyes
couldn't walk the path of an honest man
you can bet your life that I have lived this strife
I bet you couldn't look me in the eye

one day at a time, I'll make everything I ever wanted mine
nothing out of reach nothing comes in between
