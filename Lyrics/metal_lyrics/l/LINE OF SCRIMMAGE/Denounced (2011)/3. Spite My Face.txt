serenity at a stand will now
we lost sight of our own way
so now a day feels like a decade
cut off my nose to spite my face

there's no compromise only spite on the inside
unjust never to be trusted
no second chances handed out

out of sight out of mind out of touch with myself inside
nothing that's inside me will revive me
I dug my own grave and I know I'll dig my way out
envy will bury the best of men

a contradiction
content with dying alone
I cast no shadow I have no home

no grudge forgotten at all
another day another lesson
everything fails to remain
