when it falls down I wont be here to break anyone's fall
cause I'll be one step ahead this time around
with intention to move forward I'll do what I have to do
I hope you didn't put the crown on the line
cause this time around the crown is mine

you fucking cowards thought wrong
what you gonna do now when I'm right in your face?
I'll tell you now you wont do a fucking thing
I hope you didn't put the crown on the line
cause this time around the crown is mine

this is for everyone who had to think twice
its alright cause there's no love all spite

you brought your best and it wasn't enough
you fucking cowards thought wrong this time around

no love all spite motherfucker

even when given the chance I wouldn't build back the bridges I've burned
no love all spite motherfucker I'm here for the fucking crown
no love all spite so fuck you
