and I feel the fury
burning deep in my chest
there's no escape there's no restoration
there's no room for doubt there's no turning back

from now on every breath is a test
from now on there's stone in my chest
from now on every breath is a test
from now on forget
if you don't believe in fate you must believe in revenge
there's no escape there's no restoration

remember my face
I'll be buried with my back turned
sympathy is a lesson I must unlearn
I wash my hands clean off this
you cant deny
I was bled dry in the blink of an eye

there's no turning back
desperate measures forced to abide
got the worst of the world at my side

you wont make it out alive
