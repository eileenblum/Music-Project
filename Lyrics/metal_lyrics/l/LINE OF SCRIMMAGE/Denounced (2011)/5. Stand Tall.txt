hard luck but that's just how it goes
stand tall
I leave nothing up to chance, no comprehension no advance
no way no how will I not stand tall
you must stand tall above it all

no fault
I am the living earthquake
I've destroyed everything I ever had nothing is the same as before
because I don't feel anything anymore
unseen unheard I will never learn

hands worn out to the bone
I have fought this tooth and nail
without the struggle without the fight
no way no how would I survive

knee deep drowning in my own defeat
as I step on the throats of the weak

forget about the facts cause the ground you walk is cracked
every word everyone everywhere I turn I'm steering off track
nothing will be saved in this life living just to try
hard luck is all I have
