denounced dead on impact
brace yourself for the hard way out
brace yourself
at the feet of submission
look your demons in the eye
brace yourself

stigmatised by my own demise
integrity wont always reprise
I made peace with leaving everything I love behind

just let me rest my head cause
cause I owe nothing to no one
I cast myself out
all I know all I have feared has been denounced
I payed the worst price I watched myself die from the inside

cause I owe nothing to no one I cast myself out

brace yourself for the hard way out
I disperse I denounce

denounce disperse this life is a curse
there's no reverse life's a curse. cast myself out
