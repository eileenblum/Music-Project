your weakness is treason no truth exists
and I take back every word I ever spoke
everything you built is on its last leg
all along I thought I did the right thing
only to find out there's no such thing
and I learned not to dig too deep
and your guilt eats you alive in your sleep

you may not like what you find, no truth exists not this time
you can hide you can try you can try
you can try but you wont find
you wont find the truth

left out in the dark for far too long
left back in the dust you're dead and gone
thought I had it all in the palm of my hand
little did I know I never had a chance

everything you built is dead and fucking gone
I have held out hope for far too long
nothing I hear matters to me anymore

your weakness is treason I deny the untold truth
your weakness is treason I was lied to since my birth
