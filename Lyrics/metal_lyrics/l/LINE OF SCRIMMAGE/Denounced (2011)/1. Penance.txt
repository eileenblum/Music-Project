lay me to rest
penance, I'll pay my own
kneel to your knees for heaven but you live in hell now
I reached up to the sky and came back empty handed
I reached up and came back empty handed
time and time again I try and find ways to repent
another problem with no solution
another day another letdown
nail yourself to the book of lies
no one can absolve me or make me feel alive

no one no more
no more will I be misled
my hands are tied I pray no more
no more will I blame you
time and time again I wonder if you exist
