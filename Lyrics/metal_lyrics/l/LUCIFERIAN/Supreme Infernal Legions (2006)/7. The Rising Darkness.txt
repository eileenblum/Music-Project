Very far away, in the evil profaned land, the lords of Satan prepared, for unleashed the Lucifer's wrath.

The prophecy is completed; thy Kingdome now has come, the abyss burning in flames, the ancient one awake.

The punish now is real, in a world of Christian's lies, the fear rising here, now is time, of the beginning of the dark, in a world involved by sorrow, in a world involved by lies, in the horizon is appear, the serpent's revelation, for the human's temptation.

Thy legions, now scream, he is blessed in the fire.
Thy legions, now behold he is your desire.
Thy legions, now scream, he is blessed in the fire.
Thy legions, now behold he is your desire.

I await the power of your wrath, very inside, Satan command thy legions, the last march, for the victory.

Thy legions, now scream, he is blessed in the fire.
Thy legions, now behold he is your desire.
Thy legions, now scream, he is blessed in the fire.
Thy legions, now behold he is your desire.

By the rising, darkness.
