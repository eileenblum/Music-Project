Inside in my mind, I hear voices, voices of madness, the madness posses your soul, in this Kingdom of hate.

I find the way, the end of all the lies.
I find the way, the final of this disgrace.
I find the invention, now is real the way.
I find the place, the fear is not escape.

Evil intention, perverse actions I will.
Evil redemption, Lucifer now is here.

I feel the darkness, I feel the pain, I see the pain in the human's face, the gates of the Knowledge is open for you.

The Knowledge is opened for you, away from this human's reality, away, from this false morality, with hate, with pure hate, in my dark soul.

Away from this human's reality, away, from this false morality, I will deny your soul, spirit and your lie; I'm living in war, with hate, with pure hate, in my dark soul.

I see the forest in the night a calm of this storm, in this Kingdom of hate, internal feelings in my mind, in this Kingdom of hate, with hate, with pure hate, in this Kingdom of hate, lie, lie, in this Kingdom of hates, lie, lie.
