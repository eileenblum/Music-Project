Triumphant existence for the eternity, I will deny of your
Nazarene, total redemption of the lust, now is the beginning of the humans wars.

By the devil, the humans now pay the price.
By the evil, the final of the Christians race.
By the darkness, with him embrace the world.
By the wrath, with Lucifer in your triumphant throne, for the eternity, triumphant existence for the eternity.

By the glory, redemption of the ancient one.
By the power, all thy legions in my side.
The forgotten, in hell scream Satan.
All thy demons are prepared in the war, for the eternity.

Triumphant existence for the eternity, total redemption in the victory, come redemption and lust, come powerful Satanist truth, with the evil your wrath, with the evil and Satan in my side, hail Satan, hail luciferian war.
Triumphant existence for the eternity, total redemption in the victory.
