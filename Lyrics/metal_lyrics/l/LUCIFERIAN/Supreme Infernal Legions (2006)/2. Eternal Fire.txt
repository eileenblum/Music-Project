When the abysmal gate, burning in flames, magnificent creation, of Lucifer, in a ritual in flames, Lucifer prepare your reign, majestic arise of hell, by the fire, eternal fire.

When the Lucifer's sword, prepare the arrival of the antichristian world, in your domains, posses me, in a beautiful dawn, all in blood, in blood the ground, in my domains, posses me, in the fire.

Dreams of death, in fire the gates, fall the morals and ethics, real decease, don't trust in the hope, with demon heart, you can't see.

I'm burning in hell; I'm burning in the eternal fire.

I demand the just, by the spell of the Satanist grace, eye by eye, when you can't see in your mind; you are real, really free.

I'm burning in hell; I'm burning in the eternal fire.

I hear the sounds of mystical melodies in the night, I hear the voices of the darkness, the darkness posses my soul.

Evil presence in the fire, when your evil presence, control me now, in the fog.
