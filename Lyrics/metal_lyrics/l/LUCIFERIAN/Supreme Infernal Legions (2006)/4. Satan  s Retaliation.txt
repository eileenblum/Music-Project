By the supreme symbol of Baphomet.
By the supreme symbol of freedom, is time for revenge.
By the all innocent's blood, fall in the ground, the Christians are condemned, and your souls crucifix with hate, by the Satan's retaliation.

For many ages of oppression, for many ages of mental dissection, now it's time of war, now it's time, of the Satan's retaliation.
Prepare the legions for the battle, it's time for revenge, by the innocents blood, the Christians fall, the Christians are condemned, by the ancient ritual of the retaliation, by the Satan's retaliation.

Involved by flames of dark splendor, I behold the face, of the beast, the truth shining in him.

I see the bodies, false prophets impaled, in the valley of the shadows, of the Christians condemned.
I condemned this humans and your souls, crucifix in hate, by the glory of the Lucifer, of the Lucifer Empire; I condemned this humans, by the luciferian race.
