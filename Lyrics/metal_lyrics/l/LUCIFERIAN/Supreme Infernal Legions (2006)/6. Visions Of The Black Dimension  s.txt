Awaken lords and demons, ancient mysteries, the evil prophecy.
I will arise, all in your disgrace, the glory is all for me.

Embrace the night dimension's, ancient mysteries, the evil prophecy, I will arise, all the lust inside, the abyss speak in me, speak in me.
I convoke the fourth element's, in my throne, under full moon night's, I embrace night spirit's, erotic rituals, my immortal soul made flesh, visions of the black dimension's, visions of the black dimension's

I destroy my enemies, in a ritual of destruction, I convoke this force, in a ritual of the darkness, I convoke this force, for Satan in my sorcerer's throne.

I make rituals in the night, rituals of passion in me, rituals destruction in me, rituals of the black dimension's for me, the forest I can't see, my darkness creation for me, rituals of darkness, my dimensional ritual in me.
The mourning star is waiting for me, my darkness creation, rituals very inside of the darkness, my dimensional ritual in me.
