My heart is involved, by the serpent,
The flames of thy power consume me,
I who worship, the night, queen,
I'm far away, of all this.
Who are you to save me,
Lord of the god's, my servant, I despise he,
This is the place of the power, of your power,
And your freedom, Satan's free, and he is with me.

I'm the serpent.
I'm the dragon.
I'm Satan.
I'm the shadow.

Within a world, full of illusions, against your reason's,
You don't be afraid, search in your inside,
The place of the darkness, ave Satan.

At the gates of the death, the day is always, going away,
At the gates of the death, the black flame is dancing
With the death.
At the gates of the death, the day is always, going away,
At the gates of the death, the black flame is dancing
With the death.
