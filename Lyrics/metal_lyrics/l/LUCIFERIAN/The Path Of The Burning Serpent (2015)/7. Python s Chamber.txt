Masses are crawling, down to the torments
as elements bring out the vortex 
the reptilian names, unleash their forces
the human fears, they are devoured!

A splendid magician, summoning torments
the cold-hearted creation of forces
the sons of Eden, hopelessly crying
unknown voices from the deformed!

Emperor's clash against this human den
The fall of man outreached 
our strenght and conquering prevails
What will be the fate?
