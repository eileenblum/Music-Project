And now, inject up the poison!!
For it is the chalice of glory!! 
fill your veins with corrosion; 
the serpentine sovereignty!!

Lay upon ill-fated needles! 
stab up your skin 'til it melts! 
For it brings catharsis and wisdom 
Obey the envenom you will!!

"For with the sign of devotion, decomposing tissues and blood, 
I shall take them as prime notion; 
for I have scorned thy earth!!"

And thus, come ye, fallen ones! 
Possessed and wandering minions! 
become ye part of the race, 
the prime reptilian masses!!

"For with the sign of devotion, decomposing tissues and blood, 
I shall take them as prime notion; 
for I have scorned thy earth!!"

Polluted stigma shreds the skin to ash!
Duality comes in forms of ecstasy! 

One hundred souls wandering endlessly
And fierce reptiles they shall become
A world infested with virulence! 
Good and evil equals Serpent's quence!
equals Serpent's quence!
