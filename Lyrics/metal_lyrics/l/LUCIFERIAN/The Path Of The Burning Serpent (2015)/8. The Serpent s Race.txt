The sunset is now at horizon
varely shining through 
drilled prisons for giants 
the horizon shining in growth!!!
in growth!!! 

Stand in line, unlock their chains!
Let them swear allegiance!

forbidden light, I see in the night
whilst the serpent comes!

Let the venom run, Let the humans puke 
all of the flesh, The end of the earth 
whilst the serpent comes!

Sunset away at horizon
Gazing towards the south
The experience reaches the climax
Its eternal rising, has begun!!!
has begun!!! 

Stand in line, unlock their chains!
Let them swear allegiance!

forbidden light, I see in the night
whilst the serpent comes!

Let the venom run, Let the humans puke 
all of the flesh, The end of the earth 
whilst the serpent comes!

Rejoice my legions, crawling underneath
behold the prophets the beginning of the race 
a great Hail, my legions, of reptile's field
the serpent comes; it was foreseen.
