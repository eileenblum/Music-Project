The scheme is on the ensemble
We are afraid not to commence
Transcending and transforming
Climbing through the regions of death....

Blowing the intense skies 
for the energy of chaos flirts with death
A treacherous fire fluidly 
melting unto creatures with unhallowed fate!! 

Ride on the chariots of time!! Ride on the chariots of death!!
Ride on the chariots of time!! Ride on the chariots of death!!

Get yourself amongst this chaos, the human disguise, to envenom this life
The seven mystic chariots from the burning snakes!
opened wounds, by poisoned names..

Ride on the chariots of time!! Ride on the chariots of death!!
Ride on the chariots of time!! Ride on the chariots of death!!

Born into the essence of demise, the human disguise, to envenom this life
The seven mystic chariots from the burning snakes!
opened wounds, by poisoned names.
