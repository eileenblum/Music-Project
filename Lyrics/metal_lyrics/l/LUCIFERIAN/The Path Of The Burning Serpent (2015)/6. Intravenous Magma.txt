With ancient words unfolding doors straying constant visions
Forbidden wisdom in the endless darkness as dimness rise...
Our thoughts and mental chaos decimate our serpentine feelings
Inside the veil of lava lits the light of venomous gamma!

Blood is sour
Flesh is poured,
Trapped inside, intravenous magma!

Blood is sour
Flesh is poured,
Trapped inside, intravenous magma!

The intention wandering the walls of earthbound creatures melting
Unanswered questions to the prisoners by annihilation

Blood is sour, Flesh is poured
Trapped inside, intravenous magma!

Blood is sour, Flesh is poured
Trapped inside, intravenous magma!

Hate reflections!
In the valley of the torment,
In the dignity snake's fierce lava!

Mind's infection 
unmerciful decotion
In the dignity snake's fierce lava!
