Beyond the forlorn stars
beyond the lifeless space
Earth transforms anew
forebodingly announcing the end!

My path, my force, my nest;
the poisoned brew of bane!
Rejoice, my sons, my legions;
The eternity is to commence!

And hence, the story was told,
the serpent grew once more,
the seeds of venom were sown...
the hordes of creatures unfold!

My path, my force, my nest;
the poisoned brew of bane!
Rejoice, my sons, my legions;
The eternity is to commence!

Defiling gods, deacons and lords,
deceivers of all human thought.
coming from a shapeless world,
THE PATH OF THE BURNING SERPENT!

Defiling gods, deacons and lords,
deceivers of all human thought.
coming from a shapeless world,
THE PATH OF THE BURNING SERPENT!
