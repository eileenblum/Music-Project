I bow down, before thee...
Almighty scaly scythe. 
I shall cast, thy fierce force, 
on through the path of lava. 
The shredders and minions, 
Enthrone thee, joyfully! 
Whilst fire consumption, 
torn earthlings' souls apart!

Creeping
Killing
Crushing
(Omen of the vanquisher)

Forces
Feeding
Darkness
(the throne of the vanquisher)

Loathsome
power
Energy
(oath of the vanquisher)

Serpent's
dogma
prevails!
(Enthroning the Vanquisher)

The serpent lies on thousand soils
an instinct force of hundred suns
the stigma prompts the death of sounds
We fly and rise forever more!!
