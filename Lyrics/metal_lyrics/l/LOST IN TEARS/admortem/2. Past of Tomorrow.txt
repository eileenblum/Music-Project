One heartbeat in the winter.
One heartbeat in the change of spring.
One thousand in the summer
before the autumn wind.
One tear for tomorrow,
for the approaching grave.
One tear for the present,
a thousand for yesterday.

A bullet for our friendship,
a bullet for unity
A bullet of shining silver,
a bullet for me.

I fly in the air, I ride the raging wind.
Call out my name and we will meet again.
And we'll be together again:

One drink to forgiveness,
cheers to the winds of death.
One drink to remember
and a thousand to forget.
One song to my loved one,
a song that never dies.
One thousand notes of beauty,
that even the gods will cry.

One second of hesitation,
one moment for regrets.
One second of loneliness
and a lifetime for you and me.
