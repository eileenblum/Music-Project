Have you forgotten,
how it feels to be loved?
Do you remember,
how it feels to be desired?

Have you ever felt,
a tender embrace?
Has love ever driven
you deeply insane?

Why have you turned your back on me?
I cry out my pain. Why don't you hear?

Have you felt the sorrow,
of losing someone dear?
Can you imagine the feeling
of a lost will to live?

Why have you turned your back on me?
I cry out my pain. Why don't you hear?

Why canst thou not, forgive and forget?
Why canst thou not, show mercy on me?
