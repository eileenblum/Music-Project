Reach out your hand
inside my chest so I may rest.
Caress the wound
upon my heart that's tearing me apart

You're in my dreams
eternally, now join my reality.
Come sit beside
a bleeding soul n' try to make it whole.

Let your eyes
embrace with mine, let them combine.
Block the view
of hopelessness n' screaming emptiness.

Touch my thoughts
feel the pain n' throw it down the drain.
Light up my world
the forever night, shine for me so bright.

The curtain might fall
before the play is over
it might put an end to this tragedy.
Cause you are my lines, you are my words
and I forgot what to say
in this theatre of misery.
