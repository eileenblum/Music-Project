I'm lying in a pool of tears.
My tears, that turned to blood.
Wishing that you were here,
as I'm abandoned by god.

Hear my weakening cries,
as I'm rolling here in pain.
Please come see me one more time,
or we might never meet again.

Please, come let me gaze
into your eyes that heal.
Come take away this pain I feel.
Please, comfort me
with your peaceful smile.
Come sit with me for a while.

Angel, my guardian angel.
Descend to me from the pale gray sky.
Angel, my sweet little angel.
Come to me before I die, come say good-bye.
