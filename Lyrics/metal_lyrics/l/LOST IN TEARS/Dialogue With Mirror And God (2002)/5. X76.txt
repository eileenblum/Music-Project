Come bleed with me
Let us bleed
Let us bleed together
Come bleed eternally
Let us bleed
Let us bleed forever

[chorus]
Blood and fire
Love and sweet desire
Fire and blood
Come join these flames
Come join this love

She smiled and a glimpse of sunshine
stormed inside my coal black mind
but again there was light
in the wastelands of my heart

Come burn with me
Let us burn
Let us burn my friend
Come burn eternally
Let us burn
Let us burn to the end

[chorus]
