I gave and I sacrificed
but what did I gain but nothing
And I tried and I compromised
but what did I get but nothing

[chorus]
Nothing at all
Nothing but pain
and a soul in flames

I worked and I struggled
but what did I earn but nothing
And I fought and battled
but what did I win: nothing

[chorus]

One thousand miles
One thousand days and One thousand nights
and I'm still here
I ran in circles, I'm still here

Nothing but scars upon my heart
and a tomorrow that soon will die
Nothing but a soul torn apart
and tears in my eyes

A soul in flames
