Strangled tears, days that seem eternal
Without a leash a pain so infernal
I bleed today
I bleed in secrecy
Please bring me home
Please bring me home to thee

The light is gone, I dwell in total darkness
Everything is wrong, I think I've lost my harness
I bleed today
I bleed in secrecy
Please bring me home
Please bring me home to thee

Bleeding

I will forever feel this sorrow
feel this void
I will forever feel so hollow
feel so destroyed

I failed again to satisfy my hunger
I can't understand, something's pulling me under
I bleed today
I bleed in secrecy
Please bring me home
Please bring me home to thee
