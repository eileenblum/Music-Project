How fragile and serene
Her closed eyes all seeing
A beauty not of this world
Lies in silent dreaming

A faint sent of flowers
Day by day lovelier
Untroubled by the darkness
Lies in peaceful slumber

[chorus]
Where are you now
when darkness falls
Where are you now
when midnight calls
When night descends
upon my shattered world
Where are you now
Where are you my love

Love or lust, I can not tell
Still I long to fall deeper
Into a world unknown
Come passion, come the reaper

[chorus]
