I see a smile that is shedding tears
I see a mask hiding fears
I feel an anger in the joy
A masterpiece that is destroyed

Dialogue with mirror and god

I hear a song that is screaming
From a bird that is dying
A melody overwhelmed with rage
This bird is locked up in a cage

Dialogue with mirror and god

I want to fly away
I want to spread my wings and leave
I want to fly away again

How can you hate me
How can you hate me so much
that my soul can't find relief
How can you hate me
How can you hate me so much
that I can't find closure for my grief

I want to fly away
I want to spread my wings and leave
I want to fly away again
