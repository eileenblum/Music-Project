I am an object
Devoured by the darkness
I'm not visible without you
I am a reflection
In your mirror I'm released
I am nothing without you

Without you...

I am an echo
 From your song so beautiful
I am silent without you
You are the answer
To the question that I am
I am nothing without you

Without you...

With tears in my eyes
In the hands of loneliness
I wish to die
'Cause you're not here

Now I can't embrace you
Now I can not caress you
No I can not touch you
No I can not feel you
