Have I told you you remind me
Of a girl I used to know
At first she nursed and caressed me
Until she suddenly let go

[chorus]
I don't want to feel this pain no more
I'm so scared that I'd get burned
I don't want to meet the ghost I met before
I'm so terribly concerned

Have I told you you resemble
A person I try to forget
My heart thinks that you are wonderful
But my mind is scared to death

[chorus]

Sometimes I'm peaceful
Sometimes I'm loosing my mind
Sometimes I'm tranquil
Sometimes I'm everything else than fine

I don't want to feel
I don't want to...

[chorus]
