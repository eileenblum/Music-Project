Betrayed by my heart
I never could doubt your words
Though I got hurt every time
Betrayed by my trust
A poor guard against swords
That cut deeper time after time

Betrayed by my faith
I saw the knife in your hand
Still I turned my back to you
Betrayed by my lust
How could I not understand
None of it was true

No more betrayal
Never agan
No more deceit
