Would you hold me for a moment
Would you hold me for a while
Could you alleviate my torment
That I again could feel alive

Would you hold me for a moment
Would you hold me one more time
Could you mend my disappointment
That I could leave this shit behind

[Chorus]
Do you love me, do you love me like before
Do you love me, do you love me anymore
Have you loved me, have you loved me at all
Can you assure me, do you love me forever more

Would you hold me for a moment
Would you hold me in embrace
Could you confirm my misjudgement
So my sorrow would be erased

[Chorus]

Alone and cold again
I've walked astray
I can't go on like this
Does love exist...

[Chorus]
