Make me smile, make me weep
From your cage I set you free
Make me wake, make me sleep
Your warm smile all I can see

Make me creep, make me crawl
But one taste and all is gone
Make me stand, make me fall
In your command I am till dawn

[Chorus]
Break me down
From within
Break me down
Being without

Can I win, will I loose
In your poison I will drown
What the hell, what's the use
I can't make it on my own

[Chorus]
