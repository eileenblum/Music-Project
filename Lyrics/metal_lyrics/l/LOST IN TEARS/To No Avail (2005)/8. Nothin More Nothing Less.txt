The more we see, the more we need Possessed and haunted by our greed
The more we want, the more we lie The more we get, the more we crave
One step closer to our grave The more we want, the more we die Blood,
Sweat and tears Fades away and disappears Reaching for the sun and
Moon With the long lost silver spoon Good intentions fade away You
Kill yourselves, you're killing me You kill humanity Only me, myself
And I Is tattooed to your mind And no one shall survive The more we
see, the more we take And all that's real turns into fake The more we
want, the more we lie The more we get, the more we lust And getting
More becomes a must The more we want, the more we die
