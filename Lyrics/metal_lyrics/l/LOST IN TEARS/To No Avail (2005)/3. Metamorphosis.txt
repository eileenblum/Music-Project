Destiny pulled us together
Under a shooting star
I thought this would last forever
But destiny disagreed and pulled us apart

Faith made us lovers
Under a burning star
I thought my pain was over
But faith disagreed and broke my heart

I was born with the devil, now I'm dying with an angel
I was born in hell but now I die in heaven
I lived among the evil until I discovered you
But now you live with someone new
And he loves you...

Karma showed us Eden
Under a flaming star
I thought my soul was mended
But karma disagreed and now it's scared
