I've come so close to the sun
That the melting has begun
I'm burning up inside
Soon we collide

I've come so close to the flame
That everything's the same
I shiver as I burn
There's no return

[Chorus]
I'm on the way, way back home
I'm on the way, way back to the sacred stone
I'm on the way back home again

I've come so close to the fire
And I keep on getting higher
I'm dancing on the way
Towards my grave

I've come so close to the sun
That all is said and done
I'm burning up in pain
I'm born again

[Chorus]

No god can save me but you can easily
Keep my heart warm and tame my agony
No god can kill me, my goddess this is no lie
If you should leave me, I would surely die

[Chorus]
