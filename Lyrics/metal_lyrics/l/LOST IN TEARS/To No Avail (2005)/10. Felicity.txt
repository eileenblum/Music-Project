I'm searching for a flower
Within this desert storm
Beauty for my mind
Something worth living for

I'm looking for a flower
Within this rain of snow
Beauty for my soul
That I lost a long time ago

I'm searching for a flower
Within this land of fire
Beauty for my senses
A feeling I desire

I'm looking for a flower
Without it I am blind
Beauty for my eyes
And I search 'til we're combined

I see you as a star
So beautiful but so far
I hope to meet you one day
But you're so far away
...my felicity

We hold hands every night
But say goodbye at the birth of light
I hope that you were reality
And here to stay
...my felicity

Do you even exist
