Again I am alone
Watching sorrow reign
Your sweet laughter's gone
And all I feel is pain

Wrapped up in bitterness
I'm going insane...

[Chorus]
I wish that you'd fly back
Just like you flew away
'Cause now my world is black
And I am so afraid
I wish that you'd return
To my empty arms
And again we'll burn
My little shooting star

Again I am a mess
Searching for someone to blame
You left me in distress
You left me in pain

Wrapped up in sickness
I'm going insane...

[Chorus]

Can't face another day without you
Without your love
Can't face another night without you
Without your love

Can't maintain sane without you
Without your love
Can't shake this pain away without you
Without your love
