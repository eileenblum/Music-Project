I'm often standing under
Lightning, rain and raging thunder
Although it's sunny outside
Storms approach I can not hide

Clouds gather all around me
I feel so little, scared and lonely
Thor swings his hammer trough my head
The pain strikes, I wish that I was dead

[Chorus]
Oh, summer rain, come fall on me
Yes come again, come fall on me
Wash out my pain, come fall on me
Oh, summer rain, come fall on me

Gravity is getting stronger
I do not know if I can take this no longer
Dripping wet and freezing cold
I'm trapped in myself and want to unfold

Please, someone notice me
'Cause I'm too weak, too tired to scream
Am I the only one
Who lost the summer and the sun

[Chorus]
