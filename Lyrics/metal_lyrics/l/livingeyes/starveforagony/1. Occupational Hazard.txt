Starting again
Head still spinning - insanity
It's time again
Step inside this hateful place
It's crippling
It's stifling - the salvation
Cannot end this pain
by my last breath
Left with nothing
Why is this happening?
Gave you everything
Mouth can't kill your poison
You're taking over
Want to taste...
Left with nothing
Prove me wrong again
