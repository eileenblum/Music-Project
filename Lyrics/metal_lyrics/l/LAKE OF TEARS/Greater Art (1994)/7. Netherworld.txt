[Music &amp; Lyrics: Brennare]

Shadows dance, in the moonlight
A chanting dance, in the dark night
A chanting hum, to summon the wind
To summon her, and the spell she brings

"Come now", the wind calls
"Come into the netherworld
Come now, come within
Into the land of the cold blowing wind"

She comes in the dark, a voice in her glimpse
"I am the silence, and the whispering wind
Come, come to me, come and take my hand
Come, come with me, into shadowland..."

"Come now", the wind calls
"Come into the netherworld
Come now, come within
Into the land of cold blowing wind"

Hand in hand, on the dark and devious path
Through the misty land, where shadows walk
"Come into shadowland, to where the winds blows cold
And become a shadow, of the netherworld..."

Dark and evil, with the face so grim
"I am the silence, and the whispering wind
Come, come to me, come and take my hand
Come, come follow me, into shadowland..."

"Come now", the wind calls
"Come into the netherworld
Come now, come within
Into the land of cold blowing wind"
