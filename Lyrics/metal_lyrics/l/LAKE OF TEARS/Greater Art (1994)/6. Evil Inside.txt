[Music: Brennare, Lyrics: Brennare, Lodmalm]

Universal bond, we're all the same
Evil man, not to be tamed
Open your mind, and you will find
You're just as evil, as evil as I

There's a little bit of evil, inside if you
A little bit of evil, inside you too

Man of mercy, sinister disguise
Cause I see evil, evil in your eyes
Unmask youself, and you will find
You're just as evil, as evil as I

There's a little bit of evil, inside of you
A little bit of evil, inside you too

Evil !  Evil, evil, evil...
