[Music &amp; Lyrics: Brennare]

Closed the door to the world below
Where demons sleep and evil grows
But when night falls, and shadows grow long
They'll enter from the world of beyond

When darkness clouds, they'll ride from the other side

When the night comes, and daylight yields
They come to you, and haunt your dreams

Closed the door to the world down deep
Lost the key to where evil sleeps
But in nightmare lands, there the candles light
The sign of evil that brings forth the night

When darkness clouds, they'll ride from the other side

When the night comes, and daylight yields
They come to you, and haunt your dreams

As daylight yields, it brings forth the night
Around the cenotaph, now burns candle lights...

When darkness clouds, they'll ride from the other side

When the night comes, and daylight yields
They come to you, and haunt your dreams
When the night hides, and shadows are long
They come to you, and take you beyond
