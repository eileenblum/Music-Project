[Music &amp; Lyrics: Brennare]

You opened my heart when you opened your eyes
And I beheld the dawn of the hidden sky
I felt a breeze, so gentle and mild
And when I glanced the sunrise, then I knew I could fly

Oh, I see the sky, in your eyes

Please grab my hand and take me away
Take me into your eyes to meet a beautiful day
Take me into the sky, where the birds always sing
And put me on a cloud, where dreams begin

And when sunset comes let me watch the stars
Don't close your eyes cause it would break my heart
Oh, please my love, please let me see
Don't close your eyes, cause you know if would kill me

Oh,I see the sky, in your eyes
Oh ,a beautiful sky, down deep in your eyes
