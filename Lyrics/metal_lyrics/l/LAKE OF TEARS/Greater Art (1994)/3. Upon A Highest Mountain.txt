[Music &amp; Lyrics: Brennare]

I wish, I dream, a dream of mountains high
Where I can sit and look down hills, and say
" This is I"
I wish, I dream,a dream of mountains high
Where I can stand and raise my hands, and touch the sky

A streak of light, opened in the darkness
"Little child, welcome to the outer realms
This is your kingdome, this is your destiny"
That little child, that little child was me

"My son, you must wander far
There is a place, seek it skywards
Up high, where the mountains break the clouds
Ther is your place, upon the highest mountain"

A wish to wander far, to find the mountains high
A dream to be a king, up high where heaven lies
"Hurry little child, run, king to be, run
Climb the highest peak, and reach for the sun..."

I wish, I dream, a dream of mountains high
Where I can sit and look down hills, and say
" This is I"
I wish, I dream, a dream of mountains high
Where I can stand and raise my hands, and touch the sky

A strek of light, brought into the darkness
A young man, wandered into outer realms
Oh, his destiny, that he was a king to be
That young man, that young man was me

"My son, you have wandered far
Now make your seal, make it up skywards
Up high, where mountains break the clouds
There is your place, upon the highest mountain"

Upon the highest mountain...
Upon the highest mountain...
Upon the highest mountain...
