You think you know, you think you're real
I say you'll know, i say you'll feel my cold
hard steel

Call me insane, scream in vain
Here comes the knife

You know no truth and never care
You stab my back and say it's raining
When you piss in my ear

Call me insane, scream in vain
Here comes the knife you fucking parasite

To deep for you this mystery?
Now know it's time losers like you
Don't write history

Call me insane scream in vain
Here comes the knife you
Fucking parasite
