Go, just give in,
Don't hold back
A little bit more,

Almost there,
Almost dead
Come on, you're about to die

Fears come crushing in,
You can't even breathe
Death comes creeping,
Fears run deep

Die, there's nothing left,
No regrets,
Come on, you're about to die

Fears come crushing in,
You can't even breathe
Death comes creeping,
Fears run deep

Go, just give in,
Don't hold back
Come on, you're about to die

Fears come crushing in,
You can't even breathe
Death comes creeping,
Fears run deep

Screams from the underground
Howling of hate
Hate for everyone,
Watching, waiting
Hating everyone
