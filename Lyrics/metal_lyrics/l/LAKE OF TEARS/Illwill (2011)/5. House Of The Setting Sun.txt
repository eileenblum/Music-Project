So tonight the time has come
To breathe in deep and sadly ride this one

To make a space in between
In the line of all my broken dreams

Does it have to be me?
Have I lost my mind?

I'm so tired but i cannot sleep
Night after night the room is empty and bleak
Down the hole growing in my soul

In the house of the setting sun
Another night has only just begun

Can I have another one?

I'm so tired but i cannot sleep
Night after the night the room is empty and bleak
Down the hole growing in my soul

There's a hole growing in my soul

[Dedicated to Nathalie (and the fireflies)]
