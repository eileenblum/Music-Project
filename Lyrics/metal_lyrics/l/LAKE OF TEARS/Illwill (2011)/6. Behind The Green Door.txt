Let me taste your lips
Let me touch your skin
With my fingertips
I'm coming in

Your taste within my mouth
Your scent upon my skin
Your lipstick on my cigarette, fading

Let us play tonight
Let us live in sin
When the lights go out
I'm coming in

Your taste within my mouth
Your scent upon my skin
Your lipstick on my cigarette,
Fading
