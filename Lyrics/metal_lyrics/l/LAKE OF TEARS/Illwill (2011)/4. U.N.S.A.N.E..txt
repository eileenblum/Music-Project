Oh I know you dream,
So wild and free,
You're kept in chains

I can hear you scream,
I feel your need,
For lust and love in flames

UNSANE

When you're cold and down on your knees
In the pouring rain
Come on feel my touch baby,
Come feel the flame,
Punishment and pain

Let me be your dream,
I can set you free,
Save you from this cage

I can hear your screams,
Let me set you free,
Oh I can't wait

UNSANE

When you're cold and down on your knees
In the pouring rain
Come on feel my touch baby,
Come feel the flame,
Punishment and pain

Come to me,
I can set you free from your chains

When you're cold and down on your knees
In the pouring rain
Come on feel my touch baby,
Come feel the flame,
Punishment and pain

When you're cold and down
In the pouring rain
Feel my touch baby, feel my flame
Come to me
