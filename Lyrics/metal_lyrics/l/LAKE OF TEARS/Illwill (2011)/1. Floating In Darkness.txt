Regeneration of so much frustration, wanna kill tonight
Evil eye, twisted smile laughing as you cry
Intoxication of devastation, need more and more
Gonna get you good, gonna get you hard, wanna start a war

Gonna get you next floating in darkness
(Six, six, six)
Gonna get you next coming with pain
(Chaos)
Darkness and Vain

Fascination of uncreation, there's nothing you can say
You can't run, you can't hide, you'll never get away
No reflection, a new direction, here to end your life
Wicked breed of evil seed, laughing as you die

Gonna get you next floating in darkness
(Six, six, six)
Gonna get you next coming with pain
(Chaos)
Darkness and Vain
