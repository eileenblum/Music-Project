A road leading nowhere but into my grave
I'm dead
I can't be saved from this nightmare
Saved from this hell
I'm gone, in darkness i dwell

Hellbound, in darkness born
Forsaken, lost and alone

Darkness my old friend we're closer
To the end
Run for your grave for none shall be saved

Trapped in this nightmare, empty within,
I'm dead
But still breathing the poison
I can't be saved
I'm gone straight for my grave

Hellbound, in darkness born
Forsaken, lost and alone

Darkness my old friend we're closer
To the end
Run for your grave for none shall
Be saved
