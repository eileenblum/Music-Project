Poison in my blood, running through my veins
Panic disorder, growing, just the perfect day

Fever in my mind, my vision's getting dim
A purple tone is spreading on my pale skin

A cold place, such a cold place

Time is standing still but life is fading fast
Am i still here dreaming or am i dead at last

A cold place, such a cold place

Can't wake, i hang for my mistakes
Cold fact, my life will always be black
Dead race, a bitter place, cold,
Black, fucked!
