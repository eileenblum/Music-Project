Now I go there more and more
Never been there so before
Can go no more

Now I take them one by one
There comes two for each one done
Can't take them all

Round and round, we stand the same old ground
So I've found that we can't take them down
I can't play these games, who are they for
I can die no more

Now I take the time to stay
Play their games in grey
Can stay no more

As I've tried a thousand times
As I've died a thousand times
Can die no more

Round and round, we stand the same old ground
So I've found that we can't take them down
I can't play these games, who are they for
I can die no more
