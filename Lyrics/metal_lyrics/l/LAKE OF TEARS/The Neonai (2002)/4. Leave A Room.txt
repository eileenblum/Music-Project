Leave a room inside my dear
The hide from all the darkness you must find
When you can cry when no one cares
Where you can leave them all behind

Close your eyes and ride into this night
There is no wrong direction here
Just a smile for every candlelight
So leave a room inside my dear

Leave a room inside, spare a place to hide
Bring a candle so and a smile inside
Leave a room inside, spare a place to hide
Bring a candle so and a smile to go

Form an ocean from your teadrops
Set your sails and sail away
And promise we that you will not stop
Until you find where tears wont stay

Leave a room inside, spare a place to hide
Bring a candle so and a smile inside
Leave a room inside, spare a place to hide
Bring a candle so and a smile to go
