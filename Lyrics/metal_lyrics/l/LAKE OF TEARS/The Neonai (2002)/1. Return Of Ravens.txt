And the darkness calms my mind
I see the ravens fly, born of time, demon eye

So the rain becomes again
A master sorrows friends, a better end my sorcerer friend

And the rains are coming closer
Darker days are drawing near

Return of ravens

And the world I know subsides
I see the darkest eyes, the mastermind behind the tide

So let the ravens come to me
Come and set me free, summon me, let me be

And the rains are coming colder
Darker days are drawing near

Return of ravens
