Comes the morning with scarlet and black for you maybe
Past the sun hides the one with fires anew
Soon to be gone, morning comes more for me lately
Comes the morning with scarlet and black for you to

Oh, do they come there anew

Comes the morning with sorrow
Smile with a heart full of tears
Nathalie comes the ones of tomorrow
With the fireflies there

Comes within, comes without, what's the scarlet about
And the one from the sun for his fires and few
Soon comes the sun, soon comes the morning here baby
Comes the morning with scarlet and black there for you

Oh, do they come there anew

Comes the morning with sorrow
Smile with a heart full of tears
Nathalie comes the ones of tomorrow
With the fireflies there

Ends the night for the pauper
Like a life full of years
Nathalie tell me then shall we bother
With the fireflies there
