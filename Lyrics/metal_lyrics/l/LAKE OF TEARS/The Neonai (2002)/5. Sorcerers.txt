Lost in the twilight we sail for the moon
And stars light our way upon the horizon

Crazed by the stars so eager to stray
If we should come there tonight say would they stay

Now we're bound for ground patrol
When we were meant to find them all
Sorcerers

We sail for the sun and the twinkling ones
How careless they play, must be the season

Dazed by the starlight, to find us a reason we go
And if we should come there tonight say would we know

Now we're bound for ground patrol
When we were meant to know them all
Sorcerers

Now we're bound for ground patrol
When we were meant to loose control
Sorcerers
