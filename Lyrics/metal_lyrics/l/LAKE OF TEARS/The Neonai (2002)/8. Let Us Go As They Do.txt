We hide inside the night tonight
And we know that for a while
They will come and hide here to

We see inside their eyes their doom
They will go away soon
Let us go as they do

We can run and hide here in the night
But we can never run, never hide from this dark tide

So I've come to stand the pain
Hiding in a dream again
Another night and they are gone
And again I hide alone

So tonight we watch them go
Moving past them roads we know
Will we ever go there to

We see inside their eyes our doom
Oh, let us follow soon
Let us go as they do

We can run and hide here in the night
But we can never run, never hide from this dark tide

So I've come to stand the pain
Hiding in a dream again
Another night and they are gone
And again I hide alone
