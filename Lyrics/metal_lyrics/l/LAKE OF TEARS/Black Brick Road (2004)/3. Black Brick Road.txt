I met a blackbird flying south tonight, I looked into her eyes tonight
I saw her wings were getting tired, still looking for the light
There is evil on the way, it will come with break of day
I heard her say before she turned and flew away
But for a moment there alone I could find my way back home

How it hurts still there when she comes to show
She's always near down the black brick road

I watched her heading for the southern skies when she lost her wings and died
But then I saw her flying higher when I looked into her eyes
There is evil on the way, I heard the blackbird say
It will reach us by the coming of the day
But for a moment there alone I was heading back for home

How it hurts still there when she comes to show
She's always near down the black brick road
