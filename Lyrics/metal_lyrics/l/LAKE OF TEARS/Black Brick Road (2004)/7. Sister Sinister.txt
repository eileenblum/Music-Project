A place so scarlet in a well, tide is creeping up so tell
Stories of her golden time, night coming and the stars
Listen to her voice again, sister sinister will say

Sister sinister will say how you're doing there today
And by the way, how are you doing there

Lady lust in all her prom flying closer to the sun
Closing up into my mind wonder what she's gonna find
Looking at her face again, sister sinister will play

Sister sinister will say how you're doing there today
And by the way, how are you doing there
