Such a dark cold way and it enters through your breathing everyday
What a dark old way to stay the same
As it enters through your breathing, close your eyes and feel them turn it grey

Oh, heart of gold, spring time life and laughter borne, now you wander there alone
Down that way where life is a bad place, life is a sad place, always

Such a dark cold way and it enters through your breathing everyday
What a dark old way to stay the same
As it enters through your breathing, close your eyes and feel them turn it grey

Oh, heart of stone, nights were there for you alone, now the greymen linger long
And nights are cold and hard and days are slipping away paced, moving on always 

Such a dark cold way and it enters through your breathing everyday
What a dark old way to stay the same
And it enters through your breathing everyday
Such a dark old way, it stays the same
As it enters through your breathing, close your eyes and feel them turn it grey
