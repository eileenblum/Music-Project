Should we come to sail for the mellow and grey
Would it bring us comfort say, just a rainy day away
I've got a little something on my mind
A little line of evening rhyme, a boogie bubble refrain again

Come let's dream some, come take a ride in my dream machine
Let's make a funny one, let's take a ride in my dream machine

Should we come to stray in this nightmare play
I would like to ask you if I may dream today away
And for about a year we'd loose this fear
Of old men going nowhere near the grey to play the game 

Come let's dream some, come take a ride in my dream machine
Let's make a funny one, let's take a ride in my dream machine
And when the dream is done, it's time to have another one
