If I was a moon then would I be missed
If I slept through the night just for a change
Or kept in a cauldron where I could never ask why
Wouldn't it be strange, it's hard to say

If you were a moon I know you would be shining bright
To light up the night, I know you would
When I would just stay behind with my thoughts for a while
Like all dreamers do, I know I'll figure it out soon

I could go further, I could be only with a sudden tune
I could go further but I could be never if it wasn't for you

If I was a moon then I would be mystified
And light up the sky, you know I could
But I would just stay away with my thoughts for a while
Like all dreamers do, you know I'll figure it out soon

I could go further, I could be only with a sudden tune
I could go further but I could be never if it wasn't for you
