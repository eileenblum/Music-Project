I can see you walk with sorrow, I can see it in your eyes
And I know you fear this moment like me, I can see it in your smile

And no longer bids the morning to go with the thunder
I can see you're lost and falling, I can see you're all alone

I can see you walk with sorrow my dove and sorrow walks alone
