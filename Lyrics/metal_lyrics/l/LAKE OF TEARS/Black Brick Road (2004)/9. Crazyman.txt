Darkness and chaos unleashed, stiring the sleep of the beast
I've got this wonderful plan to conquer the demon
Then I'll be the one in command

To keep you away they kept you insane
Oh, they kept you insane

A wakening mind set on fire, flames getting higher and higher
I've got a wonderful goal, to conquer the demon
Then I'll be the one in control

To keep you in play they kept you insane
Oh, they kept you insane
