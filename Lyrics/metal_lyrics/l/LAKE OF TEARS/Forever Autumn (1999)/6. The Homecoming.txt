It's the way of a cosmic silor, in a boat in the night
But the wolves are not seating him he s alright
Just the day just the day away I can feel it sometimes
But the wolves are not scaring me i long for twilight

Then with the morning comes
The sun that finds them all so divides the night and they
die
And with the morning sun
A lonely teardrop falls down from my eye and I die

But where did all the cosmic sailors come from
Far away from across the sea
And where have all the cosmic sailors now gone
And the night that showed them all to me

On the waves of this silver ocean for a while there he
smiles
As he sails with the other ones the wind dies
So a cry so a cry is calling all the wolves among the
night
As I sail with the other ories I find them alright

Then with the morning comes
The sun that finds them all so divides the night and they
die
And with the morning sun
A lonely teardrop falls down from my eye and I die
