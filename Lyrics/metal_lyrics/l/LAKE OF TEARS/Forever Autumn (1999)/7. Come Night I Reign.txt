Come night comes shadows to your side
Come night comes every tear you ve cried
Come night so comes your time to see

Come night comes hatred to my heart
Come night comes healing of my scars
Come night so comes my time to be

Come night I m there again
Come night come night I reign

Beware for the night will find you
Beware for i am there behind you I slay

Come night comes all those things my dear
Come night comes all those things you fear
Come night so comes your time to die

Come night comes so the one below
Come night so comes my time to smile

Come night I'm there again
Come night come night I reign

Beware for the night will find you
Beware for I am there behind you I slay
