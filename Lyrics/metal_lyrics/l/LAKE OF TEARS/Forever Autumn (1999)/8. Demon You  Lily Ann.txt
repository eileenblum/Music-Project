I met the demon on a summer s day
Her name was Lily Anne was what she side
She was standing there alone waiting for the fall

So I asked her would she wa t with me
For the night to take this day away
But with the night she ran away the demon clad in grey

I summon the demon you

So I learned the ways the demon plays
From this beauty clad is ashen grey
How she left me with the fall left me all alone

Only sorcerers of death remains
Only shadowed ones as some would see
And the night that sings to me of Lily Anne the grey

I summon the demon you Lily Anne
