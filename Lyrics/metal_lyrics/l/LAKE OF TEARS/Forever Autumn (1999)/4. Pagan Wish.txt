Wish I could split the night in two
I wish I could what I would do to you

Wish I could hold the nights apart
Oh, to you I'd give the sun, my heart

I'll be the cyclone how it strays
I'll be the moon escaping there

Wish I could be the waking sun
Just for once I'd be the brightest one

Wish I could find you where you hide
Like the sun I'd the tide that swallows tide

I'll be the cyclone how it strays
I'll be the moon escaping there
I'll be your cancer now, the sun that eats away

We used to climb the highest peaks
Used to lay there in the breeze
Then you turned around to run
So now I'm gone

I'll be the cyclone how it strays
I'll be the moon escaping there
I'll be your cancer now the sun that eats away
