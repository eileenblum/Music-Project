When I close my eyes tonight
Down my dreams the velvet raven flu
So I hold on

Whither goes the way I ride
In ihe moonlit ravens eye
Staring past the purple sky tonight

I'm holding on and I
Find out the only way goes down
And the weary drowns

Better hold on tight

Where leads this way I go
Velvet one I only know
Every raven craves a crimson stone

I'm holding on and I
Find out the only way goes down
And the weary drowns

Better hold on tight
