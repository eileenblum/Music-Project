There's a faerie in my head and I call her Lady Rosenred, 
why she came there I don't know
No I don't know

We wander worlds sometimes, green forests, stars and stories, 
a secret time under 3 moons
We walk the clouds at times and ride on dragon faeries, 
a drink with friends under 3 moons

Say will you dream with me tonight, under moonlit skies?

We run the hills sometimes, do battles upon evil, 
a bard so sings within the shadows
We turn the ghosts away and jam with angry mages, 
a silent dream within the shadows

Say will you dream with me tonight, under moonlit skies?

And then we turn around and find all forests gone, 
and find all stars and stories gone
And then we turn around and find all faeries gone, 
and find all dragon faeries gone

Say will you dream with me tonight?
