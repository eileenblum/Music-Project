Close my eyes, think of the rain, think of an evening the same
Dream it is autumn outside, an evening to hide

Someone to carry me home, to forests where I do belong, close my eyes, 
little bit scared
And no one to care

And when my sun comes down, and you won't hold my hand, it's okay
'Cause when my sun comes down, I'll be walking a darker way, 
it's okay, it's allright

Close my heart, hold on to evil, embracing the only, the Foul, 
dream it is twilight
outside, an evening to hide

Oh raven, say will it be mine, the golden, the line of my time, 
fading and I am not scared
Five ravens to bear

And when my sun comes down, and you won't hold my hand, it's okay
'Cause when my sun comes down, I'll be walking a darker way, it's okay
'Cause when my sun comes down, I'll be walking a lighter way, 
it's okay, it's allright
