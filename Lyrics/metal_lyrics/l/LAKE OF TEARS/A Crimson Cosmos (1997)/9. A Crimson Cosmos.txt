Great cosmos, eternal ocean, spring forth now colder motions, 
break dawn now, break
new day, sweet silent colder changes

Lay still night in the forest, bring fall now, 
bring the ever rest, cold silence
no emotions, feel changes through the ocean

One went to seek the loss, one went to seek the darker side of us
One went to seek the cross, only to find a crimson cosmos

Great cosmos, crimson ocean, waves riding empty motions, 
bring twilight, bring new night, now silent demon sleeping

Lay still night for the angels, no laughter or no angers, 
cold silence, no emotions
Feel changes through our ocean

One went to seek the loss, one went to seek the darker side of us
One went to seek the cross, only to find a crimson cosmos
