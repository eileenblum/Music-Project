Running all the time and knowing time is running out 
and knowing all what time's about
Dreaming all those dreams so evil, so evil are the dreams we dream tonight
But the man in the moon sits tight, and he says:

"Come, come and try some cosmic weed and glance a world so strange indeed"

Fading little ones not knowing, they soon fade away, 
the tiny mushroom houses of yesterday
Dreaming all those dreams so evil, so evil are the dreams they dream tonight
But the man in the moon he smiles, and he says:

"Come, come and try some cosmic weed and glance a world so strange indeed"

Knowing there's no evil down where I go, knowing there's no evil tonight
Knowing there's no evil down where I go to find it all out

"Come, come and try some cosmic weed and glance a world so strange indeed"
