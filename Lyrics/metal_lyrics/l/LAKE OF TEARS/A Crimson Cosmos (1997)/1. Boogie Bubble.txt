Vague shadows, purple-toned sky, full moon and nightbirds on my mind
Cloud demons with wands of doom, chanting lines of solitude

Boogie bubble refrain, boogie boogie bubble refrain, again
Upon clouds of purple they ride, doing evil

Come demon and chant for me, come bring my eye some mystery
Strange things and stranger one finds, in them cloudlands of my mind

Boogie bubble refrain, boogie boogie bubble refrain, again
Upon clouds of purple they ride, doing evil
Every boogie bubble holds a demon inside, 
each and every demon rides upon a purple cloud
