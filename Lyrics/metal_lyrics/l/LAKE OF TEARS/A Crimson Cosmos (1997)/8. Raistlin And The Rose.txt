Shadows, shadows and fever, no-one hears him cry so he turns to evil
Only now, only now does he know

Pains, always those pains, once he turns that way he will do it again
Only now, only now does he know, silver doom, unseen moon will show

As they dance under the moon they bring doom, 
he calls her friend and says he'll change
She calls him friend and he deceives again

Flowers, a scent of flowers, always on his mind so he deceives her
Only now, only now does she know

Love, love makes her blind, soon she follows him through the doors of time
Only now, only now does she know, silver doom, unseen moon will show

As they dance under the moon they bring doom, 
he calls her friend and says he'll change
She calls him friend and he deceives again
