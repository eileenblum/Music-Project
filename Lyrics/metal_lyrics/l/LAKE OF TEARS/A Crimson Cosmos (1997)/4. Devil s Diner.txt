As the bell strikes 12, I say we say farewell, 
I say we say farewell as the bell strikes 12
Tonight's the night my friend, tonight's the night, 
the night it all shall end as the bell
strikes 12

As the bell strikes 12, he welcomes us to hell, 
he welcomes us to hell as the bell strikes 12
He's the one so bad, and he's the one, 
the one so very glad as the bell strikes 12

Oh devil dire, save a chair for me
Oh devil dire, for me and my lily

A table set for three, my lily, 
him and me and a chandelier, and a chandelier
All seven candles lit, it scares a little bit, oh little lily dear

As the bell strikes 12, he speaks the evil spell, 
he speaks the evil spell as the bell strikes 12
Now's the time my dear, now's the time, 
the time we all once fear as the bell strikes 12

Oh devil dire, save a chair for me
Oh devil dire, for me and my lily
