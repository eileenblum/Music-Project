[Status Quo Cover]

Is there a better way
Is there a better way
Is there a better way ahead
Or just another day

There's got to be a way
To make a better day
I'm gonna find away
To make a better day

You're never gonna be the one to hold me down
You're never gonna be the one to hold me down
There never was a better way with you around
No matter what I do
Do what you got to do
But do it now because the the time
Is running out on you

You've got to find a way
To make a better day
You've got to live and learn
To fight another day

I'm never gonna be the one who put you down
I'm never gonna be the one who put you down
You never know there may be someone in the crowd
There may be someone in the crowd

Is there a better way
Is there a better way
Is there a better way ahead
Or just another day

Maybe you'll never know
A better way to go
I've got a feeling
You don't really want to know

I'll never let you be the one to hold me down
I'll never let you be the one to hold me down
There never was a better way with you around
There never was a better way

I'll never let you be the one to hold me down
I'll never let you be the one to hold me down
There never was a better way with you around
There never was a better way
