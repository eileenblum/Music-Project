I think I got into the situation
With the hope of salvation
Far from nothing at all
I thought it was quite a chance
A special circumstance

On my way to heal
See I Feel
And for the scenery I need
I bleed

On my skin, the tears of the evening
The rain of the morning, burning

At the center of the situation
a constant rotation
endless alteration
At the center of the situation
and there is no salvation

The way I see it
And see I need it
And for the scenery I bleed
I feel it

On my skin, the tears of the evening
The rain of the morning, burning
I feel it on my skin, the tears of the evening
Morning is burning
