It's a new kind of thing
and it comes with the morning
Some new kind of fuzz
You need some new kind of buzz

It's a new way to go
Something cold something low
Some new kind of zoom
Into an old kind of doom

It's the light of the morning still
that thing that keeps you from breathing
You better run to where there's night
to hide from where there's light

You better breathe while there's still time

It's a new kinda thing
and it comes with the morning
Some new kind of fuzz
You need some new kind of buzz

It's the light of the morning still
that thing that keeps you from breathing
You better run to where there's night
to hide from where there's light

You better breathe while there's still time
