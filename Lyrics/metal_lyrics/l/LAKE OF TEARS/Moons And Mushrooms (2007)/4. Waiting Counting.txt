Maybe a star will fall tonight
And maybe just one of my eyes will capture the light
I feel that ease
and though the stars would better be

Oh, count the ten,
Make it start
Make it begin
It makes it through
Makes it in
Moves like a weed in the wind
Moves right in

Maybe a star will guide the ride
and maybe the light in my eye has blinded my sight
I feel that ease
and though the stars would better be
Maybe they could fall asleep

Oh, count the ten,
Make it start
Make it begin
It makes it through
Makes it in
Moves like a weed in the wind
Moves right in

I take it through
I take it in
Make it start
Make it begin
It makes a move
Makes it in
Moves like a weed in the wind
Moves right in
