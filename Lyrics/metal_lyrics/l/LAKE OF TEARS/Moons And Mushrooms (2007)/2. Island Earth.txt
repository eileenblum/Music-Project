It seems like a world unreal
When you're caught with a heart of stone
And you wonder just how it feels
How it feels not to feel alone

How it feels not to feel alone

You find the tempo too slow
I know you want more
You find the tempo too slow
I know you wanna to go

You never wonder of what is real
and you walk on the way, you've come
And you feel just how it feels
How it feels not to feel alone

How it feels not to feel alone

You find the tempo too slow
I know you want more
You find the tempo too slow
I know you wanna to go

Oh, when you're alone
