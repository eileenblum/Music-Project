Light in your eyes, a shine
As you made it on your own
Throughout a world of stone
You made it on your own

Time it is only time, a line
you waited for a while
and now time has passed you by
you lost the light within your eye
time has passed you by

There are dark days ahead
you wish you were other wheres instead
waiting for the day you'll be dead
you will always be scared

Light, there is no more light
Now you made it on your own
into a world of stone
