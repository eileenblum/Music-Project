Deep within our hearts
Within our minds
Within our souls
Within these, times
We finally found the day,
To take us through the night

Well just as it seems
Morning will come here to stay
It turns into a dream
then morning comes and takes it all away

Children of Grey
We are the Children of Grey
With amount to stay

Deep within the corner of our dreams
Within a life spreading between
We finally made it through
We finally made it in

And now it seems
Morning has come here to stay
With no hope today...
For the Children of the Grey-ay-yeah

Children of Grey
We are the Children of Grey
With amount to stay

Why can't you see, we are the ones not meant to be?
Can't you see, we are the ones not meant to be?
Free...

Children of Grey
We are the Children of Grey
With amount to stay
Not to be the ones in tune
With the Mushroom and The Moon

Children of Grey
(There's no hope here today)
Children of Grey
(There's no hope here today)
Children of Grey
(There's no hope here today)
Children of Grey
(There's no hope here today)
Children of Grey
(There's no hope here today)
Children of Grey
(There's no hope here today)
