The hour late, outside it's dark
You better stay inside now
Or you may get caught in my wrath

And I will send the demons
You'll run but you cannot hide
And I will send all my minions
To haunt you ...

Only evil dreams you'll find
Evil deamons by their side

Howling winds, outside it's cold
You better lock your doors now
Or you may be held by the foul

And I will send the demons
You'll run but you cannot hide
And I will send all my minions
To haunt you ...

Only evil dreams you'll find
Evil deamons by their side

You took my heart
So I'll take yours
Only evil dreams you'll find
And demons by their side

I will send the the demons
And I will send all my minions

The hour's late, outside it's evil
You better stay inside now
Or you will be caught by the foul

And I will send the demons
You'll run but you cannot hide
And I will send all my minions
To haunt you ...

Only evil dreams you'll find
Evil deamons by their side
