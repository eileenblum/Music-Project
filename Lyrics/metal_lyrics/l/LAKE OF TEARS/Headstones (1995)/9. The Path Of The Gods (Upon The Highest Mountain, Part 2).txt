I still dream of the mountains, where I used to be a king
King of all outer realms, how I wish to return ...

"Welcome back my son, I have waited for a long time
Waited for the king to return, I have something to show you
Upon the highest mountain, way up by the horizon
Lies an ancient path, the path of the gods ..."

I've climbed the mountains high
And walked among the clouds
I've reached the outer realms
Seen past the fields of wildgrown flowers

"Seek the opening of sanguine painted clouds
Carried gently upon caressing winds
There by the boundaries of seldom broken lines
Lies the way ..."

These sanguine clouds I saw
Appear at heaven's shore
Swept by the woken wind
Stray in the garden of tranquillity

"See through the many eyes of the dragonfly
Hear the flowers bloom in early spring
And see the lines of life untouched by time
Upon the way ..."

Faerie choirs sing
And gently flap their wings
And by this creek so small
Gathered slowly, drinking unicorns

"Stray pilgrim, god to be
Stray wanderer, 'all these realms' belong to thee"

Small creatures coming near
Then turn to disappear
All while the faeries sing
Ode to waters, ode to winds

"Stray pilgrim, god to be
Stray wanderer, 'all these realms' belong to thee"

The path of gods ...
