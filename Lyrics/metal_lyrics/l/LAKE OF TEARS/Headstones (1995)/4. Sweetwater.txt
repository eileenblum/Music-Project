Take me where the sweet water flows
Take me where the winds of spring blow

As swaying as tide, bitter and sweet combined
I close my eyes ...
Nothing to fear, there is no evil near
Only you and me
And water sweet, shallow but oh so deep
So very deep

Take me where the sweet water flows
Take me where the winds of spring blow

Different somehow, see so much clearer now
I open my eyes ...
Wandering dim, deep down into the dream
Of obscurity
With water deep, bitter but oh so sweet
So very sweet

Take me where the sweet water flows
Take me where the winds of spring blow
