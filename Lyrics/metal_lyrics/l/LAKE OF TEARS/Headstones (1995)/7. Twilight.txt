Sleeping twilight, slumber shall divide
Beware the moon mans hypnotizing eye
Spheres of silver, lit upon the sky
Short is the time ...

The day fades away
The night closes in on your way

Weeping twilight, silver tears you cry
Seeds of starlight turns day into night
Burning horizon, fruits of gold to drown
Soon to be gone ...

The day fades away
The night closes in on your way
