Burn beacon fires, blow horns of doom
Sinister ascendancy, death's coming soon

We shall take the fire everywhere
And all our enemies shall burn, yeah
In the fire they all shall die ...

And like the dragons we shall reign
Reign in fire, reign in flames
We bring the fire where we turn
Burn fire burn

Flames upon Faerun, sound battle cries
Raging fires, time to die

We shall take the fire everywhere
And all our enemies shall burn, yeah
In the fire they all shall die ...

And like the dragons we shall reign
Reign in fire, reign in flames
We bring the fire where we turn
Burn fire burn

Fire burning everywhere, death has come
Upon Faerun, our work is done

We shall take the fire everywhere
And all our enemies shall burn, yeah
In the fire they all shall die ...

And like the dragons we shall reign
Reign in fire, reign in flames
We bring the fire where we turn
Burn fire burn
