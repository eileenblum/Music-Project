I'm lost for world
It's written in my eyes
You're all I want
You're the one

Just to capture your heartbeat
Helps me to forget the pain
Baby you make me feel complete
You are the one
And by your side I strip my pride
You are the one

All the words on this earth
Lose their meaning when I'm with you
I love you for what it's worth
You are the one
And by your side I strip my pride
You are the one

I don't mind if it hurts
Heart shaped scars
You're all I want
You're the one
