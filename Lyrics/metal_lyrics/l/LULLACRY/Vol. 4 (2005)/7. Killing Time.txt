Death, dance of death
Down on one knee
I, fistful of anger
Witch hunt in me
Pain, masked with grin
Many years to come
Hate in the name of love
Time makes you numb

Hear you screaming
See the crawling
Killing time

Fear, in your eyes
I can't see a thing
Truth means nothing
Horror I bring
Pain, masked with grin
Many years to come
Hate in the name of love
Time makes you numb

Hear you screaming
See the crawling
Killing time
Fistful of anger
Makes me stronger
Killing time
