From the start to the end
Destroyer
I curse, I offend
A nightmare come true
I'll bend you out of shape
World of fire
With death, can't escape
The end is complete
I am the stalker inside you and I justify
The darkest parts of your twisted nature

I, world of demise
My work is done
Master of lies
King of pain

The mark of the unholy
Hand of doom
See me, crawling slowly
Snake on your lap
