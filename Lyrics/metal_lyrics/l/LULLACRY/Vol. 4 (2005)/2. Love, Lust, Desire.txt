I forgive you
For the things you've done
I just need you
Can't get you off my mind
Living without you is killing me
I hate you
For the things you've said
But I still love you
Can't get you off my mind
Living without you is killing me

I wanna feel you
Touching me, holding me
Feel the flames
Go higher
Love, lust, desire

I forgive you
For the things you've done
But I still need you
Can't get you off my mind
