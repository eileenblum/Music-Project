The stranger in you
Who built the temple of love
The stranger in me
Turns the light off

Burning feeling of desire
Made me the victim of
Your passion and affection
Our secret buried deep inside
Disguised as an innocent
Little game we always play
I can see you shape in darkness
As you invite me to
Burn the midnight oil with you
I am on the verge of ecstasy
My blood is running hot
Your scent sets me on fire
This night can't last
Reliving the past
I know I have to set you free
This night can't last
Reliving the past
It's time to meet...
