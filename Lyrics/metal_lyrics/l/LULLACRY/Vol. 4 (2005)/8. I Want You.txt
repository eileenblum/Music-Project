I was running away from you
Every day was dark and blue
You were always on my mind
My precious
It's the fate that I can't find

I miss you
I need you
My heart is burning with this love
It makes me want you even more

I was hiding the love from you
Every night was dark and blue
Now I'm trying to start all over
I surrender to your heat
