It's like a little death
When I see you go
Like holding my breath
I want to know
You and I, lost in time tonight
Like a rush of blood
I'm bazed by you
You and I, lost in time
You and I, perfect tonight

Can't you see
Love in disguise
Love in these eyes
You and me
Perfect tonight

It's like a deadly mistake that cuts me deeper
Like chained to heartache
I'm my own keeper
