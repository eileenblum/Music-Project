I saw you yesterday
Blind and drunk with the power
Living over the portray
Full tilt on final hour, zero
I felt you today
It's something so wicked
Put out on display
Full tilt on final hour

Zero, back to the start again
Zero, your time is running out
Has run out
Zero, no need to explain
Zero, you're nothing, you're dead to me
