ONE HYMN IS ABOVE ALL  
NATURES BITTER SONG  
ETERNALLY SUNK INTO 

THE DEEPNESS OF HIS HEART  
ALREADY CAME THE TIME  
FOR THE FAREWELL 

TRAIL OF THE RENEGADE  
IN THE INDEFINITE WORLD  
BUT HIS CHEERFUL HEART  

HAS ONE SORROW TO BARE 
AT THE END THE DEATH  
WILL GATHER ALL THINGS IN  

BLESSED IS A LOT IN LIFE  
WHEN GLADNESS IS IN TAKING 

HIS CHEERFUL HEART  
HAS ONE SORROW TO BARE  
AT THE END OF TIME  
ONE SORROW TO SHARE
