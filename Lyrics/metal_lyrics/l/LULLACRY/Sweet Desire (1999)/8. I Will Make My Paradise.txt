EUPHORIC DREAMS RELEASED   
UPON MY THOUGHTS  
I REVEL WHEN I BURN THE ROOTS  
NO LONGER MOURN FOR ME 

THIS IS THE TIME AND IT SHALL   
NEVER BE CUT FROM MY MEMORY 

AM I FORGIVEN EVEN IF I STAY  
FROM THIS GARDEN OF SINFUL PLEASURES  
I WILL MAKE MY PARADISE 

WITH THIS SERENITY I`M BLESSED  
IS IT MINE TO KEEP  
DWELLING IN A GOLDEN  
INTERNAL ETERNITY  

THIS IS THE TIME AND IT SHALL  
NEVER BE CUT FROM MY MEMORY
