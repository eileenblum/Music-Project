WHEN YOU COME CRAWLING 
INTO MY DREAMS 
THAT'S ALL I'VE LEFT 
OR SO IT SEEMS 

I CAN'T ERASE YOU 
FROM MY MEMORY 
I THINK I'M READY 
FOR ETERNITY 

'CAUSE OF YOU 
I'VE CUT MY WINGS 
PEACE FOR ME 
IT HOPEFULLY BRINGS 
I'M IN THIS PAIN 
I CRAVED FOR LOVE IN VAIN 

I NEVER WANTED TO 
BURN MY BRIDGES DOWN 
GASPING FOR AIR 
I'M LEFT TO DROWN
