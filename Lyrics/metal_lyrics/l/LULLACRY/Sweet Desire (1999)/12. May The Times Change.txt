[recorded in "Sweet Desire" sessions but never released]GO, MY SONGS, TO THOSE WHO 
HAVE INSTINCT LUST 
GO, MY HARMONIES, TO THE ONES 
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR TRUST 

SPEAK AGAINST THE DESPERATION 
OF THE VANISHING BREED 
BE AGAINST THE ONES 
WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR SOULS TO BLEED 

TRIPPING SLOWLY THROUGH THE SAME AND SAFE 
THE NOTES OF DISAPPEARING SWAN SONG 
NEVER KNEW HOW MUCH THE HURT COULD GIVE, SO 
MAY THE TIMES CHANGE WHEN I LIVE

Thanks to Acidic for correcting track #13 lyrics.
