LET GRIMMER NIGHT COME  
SWAY IN A SWING OF GODS  
TOSSED BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH 

DEEPEST SIN OF THE NIGHT  
MARK IN EVERY EYE  
SINNER HAD IT'S DAY A LONG AGO 

LET GRIMMER NIGHT COME  
SWAY IN A SWING OF GODS  
TOSSED BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL 

STRANDS OF BIRCH  
ARE MADE OUT OF LOVE 

MAID OF MERCY TURNS INTO A HARLOT  
NO BEAUTY, NO IMAGE, NONE  
JUST LEFT ALONE
