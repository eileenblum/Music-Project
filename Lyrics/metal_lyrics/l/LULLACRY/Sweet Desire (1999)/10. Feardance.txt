I WANTED TO BELIEVE 
BUT NOW IT'S CRUSHING ME 

IN YOUR EYES 
I CAN SEE THE BLAZING FLAME 
ONCE IT'S GONE  
THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TO BLAME 

I'VE DANCED WITH FEAR 
WITH FEAR OF LOSING YOU 
IT WON?T DISAPPEAR 
SO I WILL DANCE WITH FEAR 

NOTHING LEFT TO SAY 
I JUST LET IT FADE AWAY 

THROUGH YOUR LIES 
I COULDN'T SEE, HYPNOTIZED 
ONCE YOU'RE GONE
I'LL BE LEFT PARALYZED
