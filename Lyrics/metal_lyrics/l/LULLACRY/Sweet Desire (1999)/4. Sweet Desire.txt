SO LONG HAVE YOU DRUNK BITTER TEARS  
TURNING HOPES INTO FEARS  
EVERY WOUND IN YOUR SOUL HAS A STORY TO TELL  
GETTING BIGGER LIKE THE RIPPLES IN A WELL 

ALWAYS HIDDEN BEHIND BLIND EYES  
SHELTERING YOUR GRIEF AND LIES  
YOU HAVE COVERED YOURSELF WITH FIRE 
COME ON AND TASTE THE SWEET DESIRE 

GLOWING FIRE  
GETTING HIGHER  
COME AND TASTE   
THE SWEET DESIRE
