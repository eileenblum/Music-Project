I`VE LONGED FOR YOU SO LONG  
TOGETHER WE BOND, EMOTIONALLY STRONG  
INHABIT, TRANSFORMATION FROM MY  
INDIVIDUALITY, INTO OUR DUALITY 

JUST WE, OURSELVES AND US  
TOGETHER WE GO  
MY DEAR SKINWALKER 

WALKER, WALK ON THE SHAPE OF INSTINCTS  
MOTION TRANSLATED INTO A PURE ILLUSION  
LEGENDARY FIGURE HAS TURNED ME INTO A LEGEND  
AND NOW, YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO GIVE ME 

SO I WILL GIVE YOU AWAY  
MY DEAR SKINWALKER
