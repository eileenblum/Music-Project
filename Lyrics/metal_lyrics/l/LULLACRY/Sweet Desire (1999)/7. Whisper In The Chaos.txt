YOU BROUGHT ME HERE  
COME WITH ME AND  
SING A SONG OF MISERY 

I`M THE WRITING ON THE WALL  
SEE WHAT IT MEANS TO CALL ME,   
CALL ME BY THAT NAME 

BE MY WITNESS   
SEE HOW I BECAME  
A REFLECTION OF THEIR HATRED 

THEY TOOK MY BEAUTY  
TURNED ME INTO A BEAST  
SECRET OF MY STRENGHT  
KEEPER OF MY SOUL  

SHARE MY WORLD, DEATH IS RETURN  
YOUR CRADLE WILL BE YOUR GRAVE  
I CAME FOR YOU, YOU?LL BE WITH ME  
WHISPER IN THE CHAOS
