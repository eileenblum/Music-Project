For better of worse
It doesn't matter why
'cos I broke my wings before I learned to fly

Like a sinner to flame
I was drawn to you
And it felt like I was running out of time with you

All of my life's like in slow motion
No need to hide my pitch black emotions

And I don't care
For what you say
'Cos the only reply I have is fuck you anyway

Like a sinner to flame
I was drawn to you
And it felt like I was running out of time with you

All of my life's like in slow motion
No need to hide my pitch black emotions
All of my life's like in slow motion
No need to hide my pitch black emotions

All of my life's like in slow motion
No need to hide my pitch black emotions

All of my life's like in slow motion
No need to hide my pitch black emotions
All of my life's like in slow motion
No need to hide my pitch black emotions

Pitch black emotions
Pitch black emotions
