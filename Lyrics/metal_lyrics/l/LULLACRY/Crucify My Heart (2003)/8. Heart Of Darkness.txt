Black clouds fill my mind
I can't cope with this

I wrote my name in dust
No shelter in sight
Still hoping it would last
Only my pride died

Please save me from the heart of darkness
Please save me from the heart of darkness

No more shadows
Not even shades of grey

I wrote my name in dust
No shelter in sight
Still hoping it would last
Only my pride died

Please save me from the heart of darkness
Please save me from my darkest hour
I gave everything I had to give
Please save me from the heart of darkness

Please save me from the heart of darkness
Please save me from my darkest hour
I gave everything I had to give
Please save me from the heart of darkness

Heart of darkness
Heart of darkness
