My hopes were running high
Left me like a morning tide
Everything I do is up to you

How can I still pretend
All good things must end
Emotions are so easy to crush

Like a junkie I traded everything for love

You were all I ever wanted
Right from the start
You were all I ever needed
Crucify my heart

The tide has turned
See my dreams drown
Nothing new under this hollow sun

The stillness of the night
Only thing holding me tight
Emotions are so easy to crush

Like a junkie I traded everything for love

You were all I ever wanted
Right from the start
You were all I ever needed
But you crucified my heart

Crucify my heart
Crucify my heart

Like a junkie I traded everything for love

You were all I ever wanted
Right from the start
You were all I ever needed
But you crucified my heart

You were all I ever wanted
Right from the start
You were all I ever needed
But you crucified my heart

Crucify my heart
Crucify my heart
