You asked me why
I kept telling lies
I broke the rules
But I don't care 'cos I got nothing

You are the sun
I am the flame
I feel no shame 'cos I got nothing
I got nothing to lose

It's the hardest thing to do
To see it coming over you
Never thought I could break the rules
Now I got nothing to lose

Just move ahead and don't look back
I won't be there and I don't care 'cos I got nothing

You are the sun
I am the flame
And I got nothing
I got nothing to lose

It's the hardest thing to do
To see it coming over you
Never thought I could break the rules
Now I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)

It's the hardest thing to do
To see it coming over you
Never thought I could break the rules
Now I got nothing to lose
