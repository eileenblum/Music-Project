This sadness won't let go
It's hold of me
No matter how hard I try

There's something strange deep inside of my heart
And nothing really matters to me

I'm so alone
My heart is bleeding
Unchain my soul and let me go

I close my eyes and taste my fears
Down there so alone
Sorrow inside made me bleed
I need you to unchain me

Sorrow inside made me bleed
I need you to unchain me

I close my eyes and taste my fears
Down there so alone
Sorrow inside made me bleed
I need you to unchain me

Sorrow inside made me bleed
I need you to unchain me

Unchain me
I need you to unchain me
Unchain me
I need you to unchain me
