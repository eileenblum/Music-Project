I can see your lips moving
But I can't hear a thing at all

I can see your lips moving
But I can't hear a thing at all
I got lost in my own little world
But it makes no difference to me

Every single day
I got lost along the way
Every single day

All those things you have said (have said)
They make no sense to me
We got lost in our own little world

Every single day
We got lost along the way
Every single day
Every single day

Every single day
We got lost along the way
Every single day

We got lost along the way
We got lost along the way
