Come with me and you'll see our world falls apart
Wipe away your tears
It doesn't mean a thing at all

Stay for a while and you will find yourself in an endless dream
Bitterness is born on the days like these
On days just like these

It's been so long since I changed my ways
I know I've been saving up for better days
It's been so long since I changed my ways
I know I've been saving up for better days

Come with me and you'll find these feelings you can't deny
It's all I have offer so no use to fight

Stay for a while and you will find yourself in an endless dream
Bitterness is born on the days like these
On days just like these

It's been so long since I changed my ways
I know I've been saving up for better days
It's been so long since I changed my ways
I know I've been saving up for better days

For better days
Yeah yeah yeah
For better days

It's been so long since I changed my ways
I know I've been saving up for better days
It's been so long since I changed my ways
I know I've been saving up for better days

For better days
For better days
