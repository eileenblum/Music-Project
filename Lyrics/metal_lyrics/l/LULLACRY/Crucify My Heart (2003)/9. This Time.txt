(You knew) this day would come
(You are dead) you are not the only one
The world will be the same when you're gone
The way you look at me is full of disbelief

You never wanted me to be there for you
How does it feel
No one to lean on
And hey let me tell you

This time no one can save you
This time you're going down for good
This time no one can save you
This time you're going down alone

Your place in my mercy seat
Disappears in a heartbeat
That's the only thing you can count on

Can you see the tables turn
All the hate I will return
You can never wipe this smile off my face

This time no one can save you
This time you're going down for good
This time no one can save you
This time you're going down alone, going down alone

This time no one can save you
This time you're going down for good
This time no one can save you
This time you're going down alone

This time no one can save you
This time you're going down for good
This time no one can save you
This time you're going down alone
