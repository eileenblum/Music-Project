My only desire will
Bring all this to an end

The longer I lay here alone
The louder it's calling me
It will always be there waiting for me
Another day has gone by and the darkness falls

It's all over me and it's coming down
Over me in my anger I drown
It's all over me and it's coming down
I couldn't see it was written all over me

There is a fine line between
Need and obsession
(Need and obsession)

The longer I lay here alone
The louder it's calling me
It will always be there waiting for me
Another day has gone by and the darkness falls

It's all over me and it's coming down
Over me in my anger I drown
It's all over me and it's coming down
I couldn't see it was written all over me

Over me
It was written
Over me
Over me

It's all over me and it's coming down
Over me in my anger I drown
It's all over me and it's coming down
I couldn't see it was written all over me

Over me
Over me
It's all over me
