When I am in your heart tonight
Everything's gonna be alright tonight

They can never separate us
Never tear us apart, oh no no no

And I'll promise you I'll never break
Never break your heart, oh no no no
So if craving for you is wrong
I don't even want to be right ever again

I'll promise you we'll make it somehow

When I am in your heart tonight
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
When I am in your heart tonight
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
Just tonight

Just tonight
Just tonight

I'll promise you we'll make it somehow
Nake it somehow

When I am in your heart tonight
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
When I am in your heart tonight
Everything's gonna be alright tonight

Alright tonight
Alright tonight
Just tonight
