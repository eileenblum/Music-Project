Ten times I have fallen
'cos I'm too proud to sin
so easily
it can be heavenly
so come on, let it go
like a thorn of the rose
It's for all of those
Who have nothing more to give to me

Nine times I have risen
From the eye of the storm
Your light blinds me so easily
Can't find my way back to you

like a thorn of the rose
It's for all of those
Who have nothing more to give
thorn of the rose
