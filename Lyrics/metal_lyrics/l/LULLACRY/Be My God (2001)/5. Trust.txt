Trust. It's sold out forvever
Lies. Ringing my ears
Beyond
The point of no return
Gone. Pressure cracks the soul
All those little white lies, the fuel for you
As the truth dies, all the things you do
Hate. How much can I take
Shape. So easy to brake
Lust. For life is gone
Now. The damage is done

All those little white lies, the fuel for you
As the truth dies, all the things you do

little white lies can't help you now
As the truth dies, only way is down
The way is down
