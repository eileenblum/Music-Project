From here to a lie it sends you away
Can you get it back tomorrow or today
You stole the dream that wasn't yours
Locked inside, behind the closed door.
You stole the dream that kept me awake
And crushed my heart

It's never too late
To let the bonfires of time
To make you, to make you mine

Can't open mysteries with hollow way
It just feeds the midnight and kills the day
You stole the dream that kept me awake
And crushed my heart

It's the rush you love
All colours turn to black
