If the truth won't set you free
Then a lie will save you
Can you see the face of the god in me
I am the bringer of your destiny
Well, goddamn it's not worth the pain

Sell your soul to someone else
You fool
Well, goddamn give my soul a rest
Damn you

If the faith won't break you down
Then you must be the one
Can you feel the hand of the god on you
I am the hammer for your misery
Well, goddamn it's not worth the pain

Sell your soul to someone else
You fool
Well, goddamn give my soul a rest
Damn you
Sell your soul to someone else
You fool
Well, temptation loves you anyway
Damn you
I damn you
