Pretend to control me
To pull my strings
To be my god, be mine
Pretend to love and hate
To take care of me
To be my faith, be mine

I always wanted you to be my god
I trusted you, but now you're gone

Pretend to control me
To pull my strings
To be my faith, be mine

I always wanted you to be my god
I trusted you, but now you're gone

I always needed you to be inside me
I guess you'll never, never be my god
