Here I am standing above all
Waiting for the moment I fall
I lost it somehow
And i can't get this feeling anymore
I don't know where I am going now
I never thought I could be out of bounds
I'm the queen of the night
Eternal fire by my side

I only wanna hide
And run out of sight
These flames are getting so high
Even if they've seen
What I've always been
The call me the firequeen
