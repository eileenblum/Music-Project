Burning me up like a fever
Just like dream without a dreamer
I feel it coming
Coming for me
Shed my skin with an evil grin
No one knows where I've been
Without the dreamer

Burning me up like a fever
Just like dream without a dreamer

I hear a distant whisper
Whispering my name
Shed my sin with an evil grin
No one knows what it means to be a dreamer
