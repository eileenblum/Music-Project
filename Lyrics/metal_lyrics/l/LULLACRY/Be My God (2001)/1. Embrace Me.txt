Give me your teardrops
And say that you're mine
See how wicked are the restless ones in grace
It's our twisted love
that turns me on
I never wanted to go where the memories lie
In the endless night
I shall but my arms
around this fear
Don't be afraid now
'cos all the things we have
are stronger than life's path
I never wanted to go where the memories lie
It's still better to be alive
than to be dead in heaven
Your touch is so bitter sweet
I want you to embrace me
