I'm broken into pieces
It will never turn out right
I'm broken Into pieces
Deep down inside

Endless battle inside
No one wins 
Giving me the evil eye
For all my sins

I paved my road to hell
With bad intensions
My world is in pieces now
I embrace this silence

Decaying road to forgiveness
Not a soul in sight
As the sun sat down
The rays of hope died

Endless battle inside
No one wins
Giving me the evil
For all my sins

I paved my road to hell
With the deeds I've done
My world is in pieces now
I embrace this silence
