A Trickle of blood
Grows into a stream
I can't understand
How it came to be

As the curtains fall
The play is over
For me it has just begun
Lights go on
The play is over
For me it has just begun

Feel my revenge
Eye for an eye
Cold blade straight to your heart
Like a twist of knife you will
Feel my revenge
Cold blade straight to your heart
Feel my revenge

You're standing in there
But you can't see me
I want you to know
This will set me free
