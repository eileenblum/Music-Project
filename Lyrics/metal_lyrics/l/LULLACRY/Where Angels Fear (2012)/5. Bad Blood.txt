Do you ever think about me
Do you even care
Don't come here playing Jesus to me

Mark of my hatred
Carved in your soul
Can't stop me
I'm on the roll

BAD, BLOOD, BAD
Blood is all that you gave
BAD, BLOOD, BAD
See me dancing on your grave
BAD, BLOOD, BAD
Blood is all that you gave
BAD, BLOOD, BAD

Saving all my rage for you
Hammer coming down
See your pretty life crush into pieces

I'm dancing on your grave

I am the monster, riding in your dreams
Will lay you down on bed of nails
Mark of my hatred, carved in your soul
Can't stop me, I'm on the roll
