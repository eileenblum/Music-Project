Do you catch my dreams
When I dream, dream of you
On the borderland of sleep
You became oh so true

Don't play this game with me
You know I'm yours to keep
I don't want to cut my wings

My desire is poisoning me
There is no antidote to you
My secret poisoning me
There is no antidote to you

Feeding my illusions
With self-inflicted agony
Everything turns into nightmare
There is no harmony

Don't play this game with me
You know I'm yours to keep
Hit the ground but still I'm falling
You enjoy see me crawling

Don't play this game with me
You know I'm yours to keep
I don't want to cut my wings
I am not the one to blame
Only a pawn in your game
You enjoy see me crawling
