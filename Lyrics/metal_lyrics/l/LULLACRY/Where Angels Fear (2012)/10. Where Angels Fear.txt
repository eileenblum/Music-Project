Hate is a shallow grave
Can I ever define my soul

They set me free
Carry me away

How can I help you now
When I can't even help myself

And my fate, it can wait

Time is still on my side
I know the deeds I have done
And the time is still on my side
I know the deeds I have done

I rush in where angels fear to tread
Fate is a shallow grave
How can I ever define myself
