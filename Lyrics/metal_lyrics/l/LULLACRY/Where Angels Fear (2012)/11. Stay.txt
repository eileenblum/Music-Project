Just to see your face again smiling at me
Just to hear your voice again, I would do anything

Now that you've gone away
I wonder why I have to stay

On my own in this world
Cruel and cold
Tears of sorrow drowning tomorrow
You will always be part of me

You knew how to help me through
When I was In pain
That's how I remember you
Strong, wise and comprehending

Your love will set me free
At the end of darkening day
I know that I have to stay

Will you be waiting for me
When It's my time to come
You will always be part of me

On my own in this world
Cruel and cold
Sea of sorrow is gone tomorrow
You will always be part of me

This song is for you
