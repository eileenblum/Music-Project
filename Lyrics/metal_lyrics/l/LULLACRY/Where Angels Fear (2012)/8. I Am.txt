These empty words
Are like poison
This vicious circle
Just goes on and on

All you told me
Was pack of lies
You cannot hide it
I can see It from your eyes

Say no more, what have you done
Give me the strength to understand
Say no more, what have we done

I needed you 
Now it's over too
Yeah I know I am better off without you
And now you play with my mind
What can I do
Yeah I know I am better off without you
Need a way out
Wounds are too deep
You're not the one
Who can right now heal me
