The fury of life turns me on
Let me show you who I really am
Wanna drive you crazy, scream my name
Hot blood, full of sin, still an angel

I don't want to hurt you
In the heat of the night
Hot blood, full of sin, still an angel
I don't want to hurt you baby
In the heat of the night
I'm still an angel inside 

I know how to be bad
If it feels good it can't be wrong
Don't be a stranger, come right in
Hot blood, full of sin, still an angel
