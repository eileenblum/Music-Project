The life flashes before our eyes
In cold blood we murder
The future ahead of us
It's you, it's me, the worst enemy

Now I am become death
Destroyer of our worlds

Thousand suns light our way
See all our dreams fade away
Thousand suns light the way in the dark

We keep searching for paradise
Looking for a place in the sun
The future ahead of us
It's you, it's me, the worst enemy

Now I am become death
Destroyer of our worlds

Thousand suns light our way
See all our dreams fade away
Thousand suns light the way in the dark
Thousand suns light our way
See how the dreams fade away
Thousand suns light the way in the dark

Laid to rest in the cold ground
King of fools is crowned
Now I am become death
Destroyer of our worlds
