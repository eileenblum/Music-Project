Flash of light
The rays of hope
Is there a chance
To save my soul

Do or die
Time is running out
Got to make my move right now

Gone are the days of joy and happiness
Gone are the days of future's promises
Gone will be the only thing to live for
If my only friend is blank loneliness

Brave enough?
Or doomed for life
Catch my breath
And do what is right

Do or die
Time is running out
Got to make my move right now
Leave the past and fly high again
