Pretend to control me
to pull my strings
to be my god, be mine

Pretend to love and hate
to take care of me
to be my faith, be mine

I always wanted you to be my god
I trusted you, but now you're gone

Pretend to control me
to pull my strings
to be my faith, be mine

I always wanted you to be my god
I trusted you, but now you're gone
I always needed you to be inside me
I guess you'll never, never be my god
