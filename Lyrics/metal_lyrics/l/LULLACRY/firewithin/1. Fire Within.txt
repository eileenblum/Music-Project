You're not even worth the finger I gave you
Step aside 'cause it's too late to undo
Thanks a lot for all the pain and hurt
Happy endings don't mix with the real world

Can't kill me, Fire Within

Overkill, stone dead
I will make you pay
Grinding, smashing
I will drive you insane

I just wonder how you can be so goddamn Naive
You're being stupid beyond belief
Do not talk to me about the misery
You ain't seen nothing yet, got more to give
