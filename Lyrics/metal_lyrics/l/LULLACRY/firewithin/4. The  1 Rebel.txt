Posing like puppets, I need my medication
They are going to nail me to the wall
Fix me up and show me the destination
I am alone, never felt so small

They want more, I scream and shout
They are going to paint my soul black
Wake me up and cast the Demons out
I think it's time to get my life back

I can't have revolution
In my private Hell
Small evolution
I'm the number one rebel
