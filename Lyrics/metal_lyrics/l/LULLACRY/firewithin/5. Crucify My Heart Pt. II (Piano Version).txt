My hopes were running high
Left me like a morning tide
Everything I do is up to you
How can I still pretend
All the good things must end
Emotions are so easy to crush

Like a junkie I traded everything for love

You were all I ever wanted
Right from the start
You were all I ever needed
Crucify my heart

The tide has turned now
See my dreams drown
Nothing new under this hollow sun
The stillness of the night
Only thing holding me tight
Emotions are so easy to crush

Like a junkie I traded everything for love

You were all I ever wanted
Right from the start
You were all I ever needed
But you crucified my heart
Crucify my heart
