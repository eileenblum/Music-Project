War against myself
erasing the earth
and building the pain.
War against the earth
destroying the faith
In all !!!

Perfect circles painting fear
and fallen slowly around my dreams
Where is my madness? I donÂ´t want to hear
The whisper sadness calling me.
Where is my madness?
Sometimes my demons forget my sin.
When I close my eyes I can feel everything.
Angels and demons forget my sins.
No angels, no demons, no war, no return.

Now I fallen slowly
in circles of pain.

War against the earth, myself
war against myself and the earth...

War against the earth
erasing myself
and building the pain.

War against the earth, myself
war against the earth... and the earth...
War against myself and the earth
war against..
