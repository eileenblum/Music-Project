Lying down under the last snow
Am i the last in your way?
Am i the flame under our feets?
The last war before to die?

Go up the smog to the sky
The sky has loose his fire
flame stay in earth.

And all the leaf of blood
sing our same air.

Dissipate the mist of our winter
Horrid and nightly the grief switch on.

And all the leaf of blood
turn back to the sunset.

All is auroraÂ´s color!
