And here I am,
IÂ´m the shadow of thousands tombs
Crying with earth the solitude
Of the winds.
Satan blinded and Jesus kicked
Cry with us!

Empty hope of to be
Who make the destiny?
Always dead walking here
Broken roots calls to me

Tombs drowning bones... They are the oblivion.
Bones dissolved in seas of materialism

Voices dissolved
In seas of suffering

//Empty hope of to be
Who make the destiny?
Always make walking here
Broken roots calls to me//
