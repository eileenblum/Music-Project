Looking through my window
I saw the misery of the past

Can you hear me father?
Are you drowning in Christâs blood?
Stop praying father 
This faith is leading you to a hole

Can you hear me father?
Can you hear me mother?

Mother summon me 
Take me to your chest

Where are your strings? 
Show me your face
Iâm yelling for you, god!
