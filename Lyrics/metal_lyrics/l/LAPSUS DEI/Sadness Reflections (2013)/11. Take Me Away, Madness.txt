Mirror, the images of death
Again in this empty room
The shadows of the past are rotting my thoughts
My meaning of life is nothing else

This life is not meant to be 
Tell me mother, is this real?
Is not the sorrow of our death?
Mirror, tell me the secrets of the earth

Madness, take my mind
And let my soul run away
from this ocean
from my fears
from this room
from my fears
from my fears!
