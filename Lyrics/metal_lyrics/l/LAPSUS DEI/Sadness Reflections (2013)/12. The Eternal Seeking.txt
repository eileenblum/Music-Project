My mind is still searching 
For the peace of her soul
The eternal rest
Of her thoughts
The warm of her music
Her voice
Mother is still in me
Iâm still seeking it
In my eternal travel
Is it real?
Or just a beautiful creation 
The visions
Iâm not in your world
Not anymore 
The eternal seeking of our lives, itâs  taking our minds 
My carcass is growing under this eternal seeking of my mind

â¦ and the seeking is for all of us.
