That was just a dream
Donât care about it
She is in heaven (lie!)
With our lord (is there a god?)

Pray for her soul
She is your angel
Near the hand of god
Just Believe 

No!
My face turns to solitude
Until she appears 
Up the stairs
She calls for me 
Twisting my fate

Stay with me
And let me feel, the death!
Iâm going closer
to your burning chest

I escape from my fears 
And let out the trinity
I escape from my fate
Writing my destiny
