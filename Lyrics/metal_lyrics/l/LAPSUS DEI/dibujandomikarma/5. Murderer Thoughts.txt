I only have murderer thoughts
live in peace or die in life
it`s the morbid unknow dark is my looking only blood,
I see on her face psychological murderer
only bring my mind to the limit
and surpass the bile glass.

[Chorus:]
I only want, to live in peace
temptations come, temptations gone
har edge light, blinds me
turn off the dagger, shining
dark, it, with blood
I`ll cut the bitter bread of,
every day I`ll eat her tongue
and I, will live, in peace, forever!.

I only have murderer thoughts
dark is my looking slow is my reflection
I only scream inside of my soul now,
I can`t turn back I`ll write my own bible
of my personal life
I only want to live in peace.
I only want to live in peace.
