I don`t feel any more, I don`t live any more, 
No more...My dreams are gone, 
Into a senseless world, 
And the past take care of my night,
Night of my storms.*Where are you, 
Ancestral Karma
Go to the past, 
I only want to live in peace. 
I remember my last fight
Symphony of sacred death, 
I still got my bloody sword, 
Â¡Â¡Of remembers cover into pain!
