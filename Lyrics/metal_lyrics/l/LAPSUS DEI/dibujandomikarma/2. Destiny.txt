I feel alone, In the darkest of dark,
I hate the life, but, I hate the pain.
I only cry,Remembering the rain,
I only cry, Remembering the rain.
Cry, cry, cry, cry... 
In my wood, My shadows,
Wait for you, Dancing under the rain.
My misery, Will be ended
My essence goes, My spirit die.
Your destiny, Is the solefald,
Your destiny, Is my soul.
I am the solefald, In the darkest of dark,
I am the life, And death.
I only cry, Remembering the rain,
I only cry, Remembering the rain,
Your essence is gone,
Your spirit has died.-
