The true face of God...
mirage of thy own blood
"sacred majesty of my being ".
religions: be fed on the name of God...
void of contradictions,
miserable life philosophies,
minds blinded by a fake peace...
a peace that will never come.

The true face of God,
sacred majesty of my being.

Inquisition...the face of God!!!
Aberrations...in the name of God!!!

The true face of God
is the hypocrisy of your fucking faith,
truths concealed in "holy" lies, 
throughout centuries...amen!!!

And your crooked doctrine speeches
Are your fears and your dry bled flesh,
are truths concealed in lies
throughout centuries...amen!!!
