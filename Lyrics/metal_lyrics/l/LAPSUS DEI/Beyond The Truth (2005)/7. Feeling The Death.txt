Feeling the Death

The light condemn my memory
time chases my dark silhouette
and the death`s smell shows me
the sacred moment of oblivion

My mind opens to the return
of my existence path in flames
my splilled blood freezes
with my pain wintry cold!!!

My history erases out of my mind
lost in anguish...

Feeling the death

Bleeded stars are walking with me,
can you feel it, almighty death?
and, I write with fire the instance
your look is cut of because of my absence...

My dark truth is nothing else than
the time that remains to the end
(to the end... to the end)

My history erases out of my mind
lost in anguish..., lost in anguish.

To the end!!!
To the end...

My dark truth is nothing else than
the time that remains to the end!!!
to the end...
