Grimness,
only grimness,
grimness is all I see,
grimness is all I feel,
Fear,
fear to lose my own prophecies,
fear,
fear of what surrounds me and takes place...

Destroying and hating,
constructing and loving,
only uncertainty,
only grimness... grimness!!!.

You appear, walk toward my light,
face me, for that is my wish...

...You stroke my hypocrisy
as though you were my cloak
you shall get my darkness,
I am only human,
the host shall be poisoned,
I shall only become grimness...
