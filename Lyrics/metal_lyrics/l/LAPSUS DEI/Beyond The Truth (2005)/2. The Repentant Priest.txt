Are visions coming from you?
here you have one of your creatures alone,
tell me why!!!
I have given you my life,
and I look into my past... crying
I have lost my life

I look at the people thinking in love
the same love that I gave you.
I tried, believe me I tried to love them all.
you left me alone against all this shit.
