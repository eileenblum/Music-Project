The Whore

I kneel not before your god, 
king of pain and blood,
his servants in their golden church, 
practice his obscene treachery...

Wrath, it shall fill oyur heart
when you see your kingdom fall,
an empire of lies,
locked up you shall be, only hearing
the surrounding sermons 
that depresive you from your freedom,
in your humanity 
lie the answers you seek
you shall not find them in that which is imposed on you

I kneel not before your god, 
king of pain and blood,
his servants enslave us and spew
prophets of a fake forgiveness

hey, donât listen to their lies 
concealing the imprisoning chains of the great
whore,
who lurks on her throne, 
with her faith and her wealth
to capture the weak minded

I kneel not before your god, 
king of pain and blood,
his servants enslave us and spew
prophets of a fake forgiveness...
