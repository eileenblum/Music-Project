Brace yourself I got a story to tell
It's got a girl and a boy and a fist full of hell
Underneath her balcony one day after another
He got tired of waiting for permission from her mother

And up there she wondered
By the pealing of the thunder
Purity ripped asunder
As he stormed in and took his plunder

Romeo ate Juliet today
She'll never have to be afraid again
'Cause Romeo ate Juliet today
And everything was crimson red Juliet

Boy ate girl but this is not over yet
He was satisfied, she lay there like she was dead
Then to his surprise she got up and she said
You had all of my body now will you try some head

And up there she wondered
By the pealing of the thunder
Purity ripped asunder
As he stormed in and took his plunder

Romeo ate Juliet today
She'll never have to be afraid again
'Cause Romeo ate Juliet today
And everything was crimson red Juliet

I had saved myself for the one that I would marry
Now dear Romeo, you had your way
I'm forever part of thee

Romeo ate Juliet today
She'll never have to be afraid again
'Cause Romeo ate Juliet today
And everything was crimson red Juliet

Romeo ate Juliet today
She'll never have to be afraid again
'Cause Romeo ate Juliet today
And everything was crimson red Juliet
