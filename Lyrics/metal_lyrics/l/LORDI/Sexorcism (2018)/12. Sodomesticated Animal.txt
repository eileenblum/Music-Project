You look cold and hungry
And in need of stroking
I can catch trays with tasers
Take 'em home for pokin'

Hey kitty, kitty
You're smooth as silk
I want to hear you purr
You wanna licky and I got milk
Gonna shave of all your fur

Sodomesticated
Sodomesticated
I want you to be my pet
Gonna pet you wet to death
Baby, be my sodomesticated animal

To the pound for you
Because your training's started
Got a proven method
And the bitches like it
