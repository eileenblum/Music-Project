You there, now come here
Want you to come very near
Close your eyes and let go of your fear

Swallow all your cries
Bite your tongue and hope to die
How would you know if you never tried?

You were right
It's a bit too tight
But it will go inside, ooh yeah

I hear your breathing
Getting harder when it's happening
This is your meeting
With the devil, we're about to sin

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
Fight back and you will never win

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
And in the end you will give in

Now lemme hear you say ow!

Now let's be reasonable
Trust me, I'm professional
Assassinations unavoidable

The blade sure knows it's spot
And you're calling out, oh God
You're closer to heaven than you thought

You were right
It's a bit too tight
But it will go inside, ooh yeah

I hear your breathing
Getting harder when it's happening
This is your meeting
With the devil, we're about to sin

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
Fight back and you will never win

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
And in the end you will give in

Now lemme hear you say ow!

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
Fight back and you will never win

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
Fight back and you will never win

'Cause it's a rimskin, rimskin, rimskin
Rimskin assassin going in
And in the end you will give in

Now lemme hear you say ow!
