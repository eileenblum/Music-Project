Or do you think that it is something you know
To just believe in it's not nearly enough
Cause at the pearly gates it's gonna be tough

Hell has room
No vacancy in heaven
But hell has room
No vacancy in heaven

Hell has room

We never had a reservation for you
Hell's minus 5 star rating will have to do
And it's well suited 'cause there's more of your kind
Folks full of ignorance and narrow mind

Hell has room
No vacancy in heaven
But hell has room
No vacancy in heaven

But hell has room
Hell has room

Hell has room
Hell has room
Hell has room
For you too

Hell has room
No vacancy in heaven
But hell has room
No vacancy in heaven
