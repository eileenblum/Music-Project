I, I'm thinking of days gone by
When you gazed at me but did not say a word
Now those days have turned into nights
And I'm scared to be around you, I'll get hurt

I hope you're still in there somewhere
I tell myself that I still care
But those glowing eyes keep me aware

Hell stole my baby
I see it in those eyes that you're not there
And it's not your voice
Your tongue's got the cat
Your tongue's got the cat

You told me our cat might taste great
In a tortured voice distorted like a curse
Then your tongue struck out like a snake
All that's left of Fluffy was a little fur

I hope you're still in there somewhere
I tell myself that I still care
But those glowing eyes keep me aware

Hell stole my baby
I see it in those eyes that you're not there
And it's not your voice
Your tongue's got the cat
Your tongue's got the cat

Hell stole my baby
I see it in those eyes that you're not there
And it's not your voice
Your tongue's got the cat
Your tongue's got the cat
Yeah yeah
Your tongue's got the cat
Your tongue's got the cat
Yeah yeah yeah
Your tongue's got the cat
