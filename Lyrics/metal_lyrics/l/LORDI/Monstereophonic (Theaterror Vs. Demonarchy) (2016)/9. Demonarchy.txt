Suffice to say it's forgotten
There is truth in every tale
Fear the dark for good reason
Evil always stalks the vale

Denizens of the dark are hiding in plain sight
To say they're not real's a real good way to die

No use in mourning, to deny the simple truth
Missed all the warnings and the many turns to few

Ancient legion of the damned mere memory
Man would shake with fear before the Demonarchy
Demonarchy
Slay the beast the common call for centuries
Hunted down and terrorized by Demonarchy
Demonarchy

There is an animal in her
And the moon will make her howl
He has been called the impaler
He's the count dressed in a cowl

The hag deep in the woods boils kittens in a pot
Her undead son eats brains and reeks of body rot

No use in mourning, to deny the simple truth
Missed all the warnings and the many turns to few

Ancient legion of the damned mere memory
Man would shake with fear before the Demonarchy
Demonarchy
Slay the beast the common call for centuries
Hunted down and terrorized by Demonarchy
Demonarchy

The little cabal
Meets with every blue moon
There's ripping of flesh
And scheming the night through
The quartet from hell
Uneasy alliance
The best of the worst
The descendants of violence

Nosferatu, lycanthrope, necromancer and her undead son
The Scarctic Circle Gathering their right is town folks wrong

"Hear us breathing - we're always close
Don't confront us, you have no hope."

Ancient legion of the damned mere memory
Man would shake with fear before the Demonarchy
Demonarchy
Slay the beast the common call for centuries
Hunted down and terrorized by Demonarchy
Demonarchy
