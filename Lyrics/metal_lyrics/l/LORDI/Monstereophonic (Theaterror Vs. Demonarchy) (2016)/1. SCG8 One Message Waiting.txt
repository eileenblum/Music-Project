"I bet you thought you would never hear from me again. 
You were wrong. It's Ruiz. 
Oh, you're closing the curtains? 
I can still see you. 
Locking your doors and closing your windows won't help you. 
That bat in your hands,
it's useless.
Those beautiful blue eyes 
I'm gonna suck them right outta your skull,
those lips, those red lips, 
I'm gonna chew them off of your face.
I can hardly wait. 
Enough! 
Here... I come."
