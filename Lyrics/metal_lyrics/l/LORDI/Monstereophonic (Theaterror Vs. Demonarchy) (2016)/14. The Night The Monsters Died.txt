First beams of morning sun intrude across the room
Illuminating carnage that spelled out their doom

It's all final - They got what they deserve
End of rivals - Justice is served

It's the morning after the night
The night the monsters died
Don't have to be afraid
Cause we're already dead
It's the morning after the night
The night the monsters died
Now we'll say goodbye
For the final time

First light on Vampire skin it's boiling in the sun
She-Wolf in a pool of blood, dead eyes and lolling tongue

Mother cadaver, son covered in her gore
Entrails outside, spread out on the floor

It's the morning after the night
The night the monsters died
Don't have to be afraid
Cause we're already dead
It's the morning after the night
The night the monsters died
Now we'll say goodbye
For the final time

Undead blood is kicking in - It wakes up the dead
Witch's eyes are opening - In her half eaten head

Re-animate.
Vampire awakes -
Removes the stake.
Were-wolf revived -
Opens her eyes.
Poor Billy's stunned -
Nowhere to run.

It's the morning after the night
The night the monsters died
Don't have to be afraid
Cause we're already dead
It's the morning after the night
The night the monsters died
We'll never say goodbye
For the final time
