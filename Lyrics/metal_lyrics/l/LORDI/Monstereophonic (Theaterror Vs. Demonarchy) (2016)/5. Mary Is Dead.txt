She had breakfast in the morning
Out the house by afternoon
When her dog barked that whole night it was a sign
One week later she's still missing
We all wonder could our mary be alive

We talk about the way she used to smile
When she got caught out in the rain
We all recall the sparkle in her eyes
Too bad they won't see her again
'Cause Mary is dead

Well, they haven't found a crime scene,
So I helped put posters up
They can search till they get blisters on their feet
All the while I keep my secret
Mary, Mary, how I loved to see you bleed

We talk about the way she used to smile
When she got caught out in the rain
We all recall the sparkle in her eyes
Too bad they won't see her again
'Cause Mary is dead
'Cause I know that Mary is dead

We talk about the way she used to smile
When she got caught out in the rain
We all recall the sparkle in her eyes
Too bad they won't see her again
'Cause Mary is dead
Mary is dead
Mary is dead 
Mary is dead 
Mary is dead
