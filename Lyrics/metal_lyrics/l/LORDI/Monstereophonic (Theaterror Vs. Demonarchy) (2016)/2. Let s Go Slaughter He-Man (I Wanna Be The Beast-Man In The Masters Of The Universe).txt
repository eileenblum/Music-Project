Skeletor is the coolest lead on evil's side
Never mind his voice, on his face I base my choice

Though he's ruling Snake Mountain
Castle Greyskull is the shit
He-Man should understand it's time to pack is bags

He-Man go away, but Teela, you should stay
I have the power
This is the time He-Man must die

Let's go slaughter He-Man
Kill the sissy and make it hurt
I wanna be the Beast-Man
In the Masters Of The Universe
Let's go slaughter He-Man
Kill the sissy and make it hurt
I wanna be the beast man
In the Masters Of The Universe, tonite

C'mon, He-Man's a loser
And whatta hell's with that hair
He-Man's head should be on a stake
in front of Greyskull's gate

On the day that it happens we will celebrate
We'd see tears of joy in the empty eye sockets
of the evil leader's face

He-Man go away, but Teela, you should stay
I have the power
This is the time He-Man must die

Let's go slaughter He-Man
Kill the sissy and make it hurt
I wanna be the Beast-Man
In the Masters Of The Universe
Let's go slaughter He-Man
Kill the sissy and make it hurt
I wanna be the beast man
In the Masters Of The Universe, tonite

Kill!
Since wimpy He-Man is in pieces, torn
Who would have thought that we would be so bored

Let's go slaughter He-Man
Kill the sissy and make it hurt
I wanna be the Beast-Man
In the Masters Of The Universe
Let's go slaughter He-Man
Kill the sissy and make it hurt
I wanna be the beast man
In the Masters Of The Universe, tonite
