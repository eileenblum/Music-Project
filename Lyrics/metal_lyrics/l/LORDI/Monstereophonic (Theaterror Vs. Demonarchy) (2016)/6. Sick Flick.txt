Baby, you look like an actress, do you act?
Lady, I'm throwing a party at my pad
Maybe you're willing to do what you have to
Baby, it looks like you'd

Do it all and even more
Anything at all, anything
Everything, everything

Baby I'm casting a sick flick
A part in sick flick ain't that hard
You got the looks for a sick flick
And in my sick flick you're the star

Baby, I wanna know what's behind those eyes
Lady, what color are you deep down inside
Maybe I'll find out when I jackhammer you
Baby, are you willing to

Do it all and even more
Anything at all, anything
Everything, everything

Baby I'm casting a sick flick
A part in sick flick ain't that hard
You got the looks for a sick flick
And in my sick flick you're the star

Baby I'm casting a sick flick
A part in sick flick ain't that hard
You got the looks for a sick flick
And in my sick flick you're the star
