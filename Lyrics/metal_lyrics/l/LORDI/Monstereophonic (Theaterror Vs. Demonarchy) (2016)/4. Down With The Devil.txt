I'm going down with the devil
That's what I've been told forever
For all the things that I love lead to hell

Here I go down with the devil
So far it's the best journey ever
I've been told I'm sick but I'm feeling pretty well

They say the devil dressed me
They hear him speak when I speak
They say I'm lost and damned
But I know damn well just where I am

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Down with the devil I go

There's hell to pay said the devil
But I'm a real go getter
I'm sure that I'll find a soul I can sell

They say the devil dressed me
They hear him speak when I speak
They say I'm lost and damned
But I know damn well just where I am

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Down with the devil I go

Down Down Down Down with the devil
Down Down Down Down with the devil
Down Down Down Down with the devil

They say the devil dressed me
They hear him speak when I speak
They say I'm lost and damned
But I know damn well just where I am

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Do I go down?
Down with the devil?
Down with the devil I go

Down with the devil I go
