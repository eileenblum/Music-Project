Something's moving swarming under rugs
Cold flesh cosy home for worms and bugs

Their children, bad omen, these evil seeds will grow
Dark havens, black ravens, thunder's about to blow

Hell's already here if we are living to die
Beast loose in paradise
Who knows if we're gonna meet in heaven tonight?
Beast loose in paradise

The beast is loose!
The beast is loose!

Madness rose upon their last of kin
Crazy hungry for another sin

Their children, bad omen, these evil seeds will grow
Dark havens, black ravens, thunder's about to blow

Hell's already here if we are living to die
Beast loose in paradise
Who knows if we're gonna meet in heaven tonight?
Beast loose in paradise

The beast is loose!
The beast is loose!

Vertigo swirls down
To skeletal hell
Wrapped up in a death shroud
Biting at souls who are ready to fall

Hell's already here if we are living to die
Beast loose in paradise
Who knows if we're gonna meet in heaven tonight?
Beast loose in paradise.

Hell's already here if we are living to die
Beast loose in paradise
Who knows if we're gonna meet in heaven tonight
Beast loose in paradise
