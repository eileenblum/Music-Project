Who the hell dâya think you are you fuckface !

You donât know shit
About nothing you say
Iâm the electric dinosaur
Iâm a walking wonder, yeah
You see my face is pretty
And my voice is thunder
Prepare yourself
To get ripped asunder
You thought that
Youâd get smart with me

You know me, my name is monster
Now donât you call my name in vain
You know my name and what it stands for
For monster is my name
You know me my name is monster
Iâll never let you get away
You know my name and where it comes from
For monster is my name
For monster is my name

You know what, I think you love me
You say you hate my guts
But I see what I see
If you could be me
Youâd never change back, no
Cause Iâm fucking awesome
And I know that it's good to be me
Now isnât that a fun fact
My one true love is me, me, me

My name is monster
And you know what Iâm about
And when you see me
All you want to do is shout
My name is monster
And Iâm here for you
I am your monster
Let me play with you
