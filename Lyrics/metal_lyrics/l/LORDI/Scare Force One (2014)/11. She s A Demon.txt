Dear mother how are you
Iâm writing you with news
Iâm courting someone and itâs serious
She is a maiden fair
As sweet as an Ã©clair
And when she laughs itâs so mellifluous

Looks like and angel fell on earth
Thereâs just one thing about this girl

She is a demon
She is a demon
Canât help myself I love her so
Yeah, sheâs a demon
Yes, sheâs a demon
The one I gave my heart and soul

Dear mom itâs been a while
Weâve moved from Staten Isle
The constables caught her ripping off heads
Now we live in the woods
So far sheâs being good
I love her still but now her eyes glow red

Dear mother this might be goodbye
But know this
I have been happy my whole life
