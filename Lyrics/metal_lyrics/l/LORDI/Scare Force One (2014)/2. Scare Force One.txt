Can you hear?
Are you ready?

Clouds are taking deadly form
Black becomes the sky
Locusts start to swarm
Skeletons are brought to life

The branches of the cherry trees
Impaling their prey
Pestilence and war
Rain destruction down today

Grandpaâs footsteps in the snow
Are clear and then disappear
Mother in slow motion
Kills her dear infant out of fear
Hear ye, hear ye,
oh, thereâs no denying whatâs coming here

Air roars Scare Force One
Air roars Scare Force One

Little Ralph is not quite right
He ate the dog alive
Parakeets get loose
Keen on packing out your eyes

Drones lock on autonomous
Missiles taking flight
Nations starts to fall
Paranormal worlds collide

In the air a frightful thing
Part animal, part machine
Swooping down on bat-like wings
To shred using razor teeth
Death from above mercilessly annihilate everything

Air roars Scare Force One
Air roars Scare Force One

Scare Force One
Scare Force One

Infernal echo
Now hear us roar
Scare Force
Scare Force
The airborne nightmare flies
Scare Force
Scare Force
Scare Force One arrives

Air roars Scare Force One
Air roars Scare Force One
Air roars Scare Force One
Air roars Scare Force One
