[Japanese Bonus Track]Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night
I want to love you
Feel you
And wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you
Please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go

I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry
And if we still playing around
Boy that's just fine

Let's get excited
We just can't hide it
I'm about to loose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I know
I know
I know
I know
I want you
I want you

I want to love you
Feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you
Please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go

I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know
I want you
I want you

Look what you do to me
You got me burning up

I'm so excited
I just can't hide it
I'm about to loose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
I know I know I know...
