Jack and coke
Rock 'n' roll
Lose control

Dirty thoughts
Way too much
Not enough

Good girls get bad, get hammered
Party like Frankenstein
The place will be a wreck by sunrise
Franky needs a bride

Show no control, get hammered
I'll show you Frankenstein
Come and get the wrong that feels right
The hammer nails tonight

Dr. Pepper
With Jameson
Now this is fun

You say it's my fault
But it's your choice
'Cause I'm a dirty boy

Good girls get bad, get hammered
Party like Frankenstein
The place will be a wreck by sunrise
Franky needs a bride

Show no control, get hammered
I'll show you Frankenstein
come and get the wrong that feels right
The hammer nails tonight

Crying
Hurting
Bleeding
Nailed by the hammer of Frankenstein

Hey Frankie's brides
First get hammered, then get nailed
It's nailing time
First get hammered, then get nailed

Raise a glass to the German tank
True master of this game
The stuff of legends how he drank
He said, "What can I say?"

Good girls get bad, get hammered
Party like Frankenstein
The place will be a wreck by sunrise
Franky needs a bride

Show no control, get hammered
I'll show you Frankenstein
Come and get the wrong that feels right
The hammer nails tonight

Good girls get bad, get hammered
Party like Frankenstein
The place will be a wreck by sunrise
Franky needs a bride

Show no control, get hammered
I'll show you Frankenstein
Come and get the wrong that feels right
The hammer nails tonight

Crying, hurting, bleeding
Nailed by the hammer
Nailed by the hammer
Nailed by the hammer of Frankenstein
