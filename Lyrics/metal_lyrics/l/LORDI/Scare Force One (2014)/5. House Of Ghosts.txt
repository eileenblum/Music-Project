My dogs all like you
Their sense ring true
They wag their tails when youâre close by
Sometimes I fell you
A cold breeze passing through me
Glimpsed from the corner of my eye

I know you try to make me understand

Living in the house of ghosts
With roommates from the afterlife
Living in the house of ghosts
I canât evict them if I tried
Living in the house of ghosts
Reluctant to accept the signs
Living in the house of ghosts
Bound to me through space and time

I hear you whisper
And in the winter
I see your shadow passing by
These walls are hiding
The farewell writing
Written by those about to die

Iâm right beside you
Iâm right beside you
Iâm right beside you
Iâm right beside you
