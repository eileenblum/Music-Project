Neon hair thatâs much too bright
Something isnât right
Children should all gather round
But they run and hide
A smiling face painted in place
Hiding the rage
Here comes a mace

The partyâs just began and kids eat too much cake
Weâre gonna have some fun
So run for heavenâs sake

Hell sent in the clowns
Of masquerade and murder
Yeah, hell sent in the clowns
Of laughter and of slaughter
Yeah, hell sent in the clowns

Lapel flowers squirt kids eyes
Now theyâve lost their sight
Clowns are funny, yes we are
Weâre laughing as you die
Exploding cigars take off an arm
Cry in alarm, theyâre here to do harm

Clowns are coming
Clowns are coming
