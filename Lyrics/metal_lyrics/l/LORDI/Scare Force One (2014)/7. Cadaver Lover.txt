He wasnât found but he has a grave
She couldnât bear giving him up, ever
Not even death could stand in the way
No matter what sheâd keep them together

No one could see her hide him
Her mindâs at ease
She can only feel desire
For the deceased

D-E-A-D cadaver love
How can love be a bad thing
D-E-A-D cadaver love
Is there no understanding her?

Last Friday night she went out alone
She took her tools and her cruel intentions
Her leather jacket with skull and bones
Observing prey from her dark dimension

No one can see her staking
Her mindâs at ease
She can only feel desire
For the deceased

Cadaver lover, cadaver lover
Sheâll never love you alive
Cadaver lover, cadaver lover
To lover her is to die
