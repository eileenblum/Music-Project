You hear the rumble off in the distance
Louder than thunder, extreme, absurd
Your shock and overcome resistance
Crowned the elite of the underworld

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play by fear
Weâre the united rocking dead

Thereâs no escaping our domination
Bow to our will or you we will break
A lucky few turned into our minions
Vow to maintain order in our wake

Weâre here to subjugate
Demons that decimate
A monster war machine
Drowning out screams

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
Weâre the united rocking dead

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
Weâre the united rocking dead

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
Weâre the united rocking dead
