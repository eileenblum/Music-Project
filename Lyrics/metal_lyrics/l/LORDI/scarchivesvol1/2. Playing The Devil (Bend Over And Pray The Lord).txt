Hell-o! I am me who the hell R U?
See my eyes glow in a gloom?
I'm telling you there's an evil inside.
Yeah, crating a fuss of me
infernal debauchery...
When power burns alive,
raging at the skies,
that's when the monster-men arrive.

I am above it all.
Watching the others fall.
I'm calling myself a juggernaut.
Becoming more than a man
-one helluva man I am.
But I would feel alive
if I could take her life,
see my demon in her eye.

Playing the devil
with stronger than ever
(bend over and pray the lord)

I don't have a thing to say:
once you have power you don't need brains,
just need a reason to go insane.
Distinctive as I am
-exposing you my demon-fangs.
...I'm the man of the most dangerous kind.

Scratching the soul.
Raping your mind.
I would feel alive...
