You told me everything that I could
or couldn't do
Now I'm defying you
You told me all the things what I should or shouldn't say
Now your major threat is me
I'm becoming a leviathan
Bursting out with power

(Beware the beast you see in me emniuoytseabehter aweB)

My ego's overgrowing - arising to the skies
Now your place will be mine
Witness the birth of giants - the evil overlords
this race superior

I am the leviathan
Bursting out with power (Ooh, behold the beast)
I'm all around 
Beware the beast you see in me

I'm a demon in heat Spreading disease
I'm a demon in heat Spreading disease
I'm the lord of the breed of the freaks
I'm all around
