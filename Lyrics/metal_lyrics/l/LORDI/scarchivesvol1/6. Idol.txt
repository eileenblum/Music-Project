[originally by Kiss]He's the man of all men
He's dirty, he's mean
Some call him the demon
Some call him Gene
He's dressed in an armour
He spits blood and fire
He's the bat winged lizzard
of lust and desire

Idol,
I wanna be like you
I wanna do what you do
You're my obsession

Idol,
You're the demon in me
You're the dream that I feed
Idol I love you too much

His face is black and white
Watch his snake-tongue roll
He's the god of thunder
He rips my soul
He conquers all the women
gives them rides of their lives

If I only were a lady
So maybe I could have a try
