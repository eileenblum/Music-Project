From the dark side of the moon
Flies a raven calling onto you
And yet the dawn is getting near
the night awaits exposing all your fears

She'll come to you at night
Like shadow in the skies
Waiting for the sign

Take me to your leader, honey!
I've come to make you understand
You gotta get down to boogie
with the monster-men
You gotta get down

Can't you feel me in your veins?
I'm in your blood. I'm the pleasure in the pain
Odor of death blowing in
Now meet the monsters, the mothers of all sin
She'll come to you at night...
