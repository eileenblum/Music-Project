Be a hammer hit the nail
Through the skull to the brain
Be a true hatemonger
Get to be a little stronger
Be a tyrant that you are
What you wish you were whatever
Fire fire fire
Still burns you motherfucker
Yeah I prefer to paint in blood

The glory days are over now
You made a blunder oh man
You're going under now burn
You just don't get any stronger
Now how much longer can it take for
You to realize that
Fire fire fire
Will burn the motherfucker
Yeah I prefer to paint in blood

It ain't gonna mean a thing
No matter what
The family still cries for blood

This is how you look like when
You're peeled off from your skin
Yeah, go on have a look
And I will drag you in
What you might have heard of me
Is nothing like I am no
People have a way of
Painting truth in rosy colors
Yeah I prefer to paint in blood

It ain't gonna mean a thing
No matter what you (gonna) do or say
No matter whom you're gonna (curse or) pray
No matter what the family still cries for blood
