Don't I know you?
I know what U do
Yes, there U R once again spying on
my every move
My skin is thick
It makes U sick
U're like a fungus, U crack down on me
off the reel

U try to wreck my engine
As I try to keep it shining clean
U scratch my chrome, U rust my steel
But still I am the one at the wheel

I'm the man in the house I am
the monstermotorhellmachine
I am the monster and the man

I don't have to prove
my faith to U
What I may say I may do still it won't
make me your fool
So is this the world
U've been dreaming of?
Is this the way U would like me to play?
Is this your game?

I am wide awake and I'm blasting along
U won't believe your neck could break
The lord is here to prove U wrong

I'm the man in the house I am
the monstermotorhellmachine
