[Bonus Track]Among the right or wrong
No, I won't go along
Tired of hearing orders from the world

Ooh, I shake your hand and smile
Still outcast all the wild
Look in my eyes, there's calm before the storm

I wanna know which way to go
I'm sent to blow, a hulking dynamo
I stomp around, breaking the ground
I am the sound of hulking dynamo

Your world is out of date
Fast or super rate
Swelling up with authority

Yeah, you're eager to get away
Always going but not today
To god damn big, for anyone to bleed, yeah

Dynamo, Dynamo!
