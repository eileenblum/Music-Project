I'm in you now in too deep
My rose scarlett as blood too sweet
Call off the wedding my demons arrived
I have seen this before
and into you garden I shall overcome
Turn your blossom into sand

You're so sweet and you're only mine
I'll take thee until the end of time
Dressed in white you're forever mine
Dress is death and this dress suits you fine

I'm in you now much too deep
Your blood scarlett as rose too sweet
