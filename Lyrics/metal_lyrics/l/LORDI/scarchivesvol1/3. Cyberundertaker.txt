Wait... I'm changing
Malformation grows
Wait... I'm aching
Blood pressure's low
Hey now I'm wrecking!
Mutation overloaded
Heyeyeah, I'm changing
cast-iron flame-thrower!

Sane dog bites baby
Infernal vision-baker
Steel-mind and -body
Cyberundertaker.
GO Cyberhino!
Cyberundertaker.

Brain-pollution
Barb-wire lives
Chained to damnation,
internal robot reveals.
GO Cyberhino!
Cyberundertaker.

Please believe me,
I'm not the same.
I'm not as weak inside,
I'm just a cold device,
It's a killing machine before your eyes!
GO Cyberhino!
Cyberundertaker.
