By the fowlest tooth
Swallowing the fowlest food
Then pop off insecured
Violated and nude
Giving up the ghost
What you were is what you get
It is a feeding time for the lord
Heretic lesson that you won't forget

Take away the scepter
Take away the crown
But nothing brings me d-d-down

Little piggy is on the run
Now lies under the gun
The sound of a shattering glass
Lights a heart upon its ass
Fuck the solitude
There's a war out like you wouldn't know it
It's deeding time for the freaks
Gotta find it, gotta kill it and hide it

Pick to pieces, suffocate a man
All eyes on me, like I would give a damn

You may take away the scepter
And take away the crown
But nothing brings me d-d-down
Still the orchestra plays the mighty swine:
White lighting moonshine

Pick the pieces, suffocate a man
All eyes on me, like I would give a damn

It's a peek inside the mighty swine:
White lighting moonshine
