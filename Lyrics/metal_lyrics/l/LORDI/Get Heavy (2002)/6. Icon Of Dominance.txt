Would you be satisfied if I told you lies would it make it right
No I won't justify your masquerade like cries I know it will go by
There is no soul no soul could chain mine and call it it's own
I'll be your reason to loathe shoot you futile bolt don't push it I know you know 
You're held by the cold do what you are told the icon of dominance
Distort it all you can your full blown masterplan will get you in a jam
When cheers form into jeers despair is drawin' near glances grow to become the weapons of fear
There is no soul no soul could chain mine and call it it's own
I'll be your reason to loathe shoot you futile bolt don't push it I know you know 
You're held by the cold do what you are told the icon of dominance
Can't you see me can't you see me stalking day dream escape surreal haze
Distort it all you can there is no soul no soul could ever make me it's own
I'll be your reason to loathe shoot you futile bolt don't push it I know you know 
You're held by the cold do what you are told the icon of dominance
Reason to loathe shoot you futile bolt don't push it I know you know 
You're held by the cold do what you are told the icon of dominance aw
