So she got up in the morning may this day be the day of confidence
Consider it a fair warning gonna turn it on ten the turbulence
Oh lord they tried to wear her down blinding is the sound
Now tell me where have you seen her have you seen hellbender turbulence
Now tell me where have you seen her have you seen hellbender turbulence
Now who's wheelin' and dealin' may this day be the day of reckoning
Unconventional meanings give the devil his due for dirty things
Oh lord they tried to wear her down blinding is the sound
Now tell me where have you seen her have you seen hellbender turbulence
Now tell me where have you seen her have you seen hellbender turbulence
