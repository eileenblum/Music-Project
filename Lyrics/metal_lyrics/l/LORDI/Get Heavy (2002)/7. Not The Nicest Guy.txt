Just for spite every day every night you still wonder you wonder
From the ashes I rise by the roll of the dice you'll go under go under
You never realized I'm back here to stay like a fungus that grows on your side
You never realized I won't go away not tonight
I'll never leave you lonely I'll be there tryin' to grab a hold yeah 
I'm not the nicest guy you know
You'll never leave me darling now hear my tender warning 
I'm not the nicest guy you know aw
You'll see me again in the thunder and rain I come crawlin' I come crawlin'
I've got eyes everywhere from the shadows I stare at you darling my darling
You never realized I'm back here to stay like a fungus that grows on your side
You never realized I won't go away not tonight no no
I'll never leave you lonely I'll be there tryin' to grab a hold yeah 
I'm not the nicest guy you know
You'll never leave me darling now hear my tender warning 
I'm not the nicest guy you know aw ooh yeah hmm guitar
I'll never leave you lonely I'll be there tryin' to grab a hold yeah 
I'm not the nicest guy you know
You'll never leave me darling now hear my tender warning 
I'm not the nicest guy you know aw
