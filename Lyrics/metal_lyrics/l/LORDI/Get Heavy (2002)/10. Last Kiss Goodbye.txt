Lying by the trees all wrapped up in leaves I lay down to sleep you're so lovely
Little hands so white and pale blue under your nails I wanna show how much I care sleeping beauty
We'll let this be our hideaway our secret 
I'll set you free though I must stay 'cause our love can't be shared
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you well in hell
It's been years since we last met now it's fall and leaves are wet
I think you must have lost some weight but you're still lovely
We'll let this be our hideaway our secret 
I'll set you free though I must stay 'cause our love can't be shared
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you well in hell
I know you will be waiting sleeping in your pelt
If I couldn't have your baby no one ever will 'cause our love can't be shared aah
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you well 
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you
This will be your one last kiss goodbye and I wish you and I wish you well in hell
