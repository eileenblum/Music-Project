As a kid in kindergarten they made you cry
Told you mommy won't come back and you believed the lie
Classmates in second grade all abandoned you
They laughed as you got your ass kicked right after school

Of all the loser freaks
You were the most undatable
The grades you got in school
Were laughable
You're afraid of getting clawed
When you pet your cat
Your dog wants a treat
You think it wants to attack

Another year has gone and everything's worse no
The way your fears come true is like a smackdown
And we got more where that come from

(Now have a / Wishing)
Happy happy new fear
Happy new fear
And the more it consumes
Happy happy new fear
And the fear is killing you

You tell yourself that
Everything's gonna be all right
We'll take it up a notch and
Boom!- you family dies
And when you see my face
You believe in the supernatural
You'll learn that demons
Are not fairytales, they're factual
