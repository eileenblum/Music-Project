Screaming- out their bloody lungs
Riuning their beautiful young voices
Steaming hot- horny licking tongues
Making all those terribly wrong choices

All you little children have gone out of your minds
Don't wanna read no history- let's practise some biology

Make you mommy cry- Daddy blows his mind
Listen up and learn- We're not bad for the kids, we're worse
Make 'em take offense- Taint your innocence
The first time always hurts- We're not bad for the kids, we're worse

Wasted- fried their little brains
Staying out too late and getting crazy
Waintin'- 'til it's far too late
Corrupted to the core and not worth saving

Hey kids, you know that your parent are right
You should not ne nasty, no picking a fight
Don't dress up like that, yeah, you dad he knows better
As if he never wanted to see your mom in tight leather
