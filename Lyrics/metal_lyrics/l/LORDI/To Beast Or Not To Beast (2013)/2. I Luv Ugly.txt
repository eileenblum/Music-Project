Those little furry things
With cute little tails
That little girls love to pet
They are the food for things
All covered in scales
I'll take all I can get

Now listen kiddies
I salute the freaks
It's only pretty
when it's nasty

I luv ugly
No such thing
As too extreme
I luv ugly
No over the top
All hail the freaks
I luv ugly
I luv ugly!

Hell yeah you know this face
You've seen me before
But you don't know who I am
I've never heard of you
But you want war
You'll get my ten pound boot
Up your ass

All hail the Freaks!

Ugly I luv ugly
Luv ugly I luv
