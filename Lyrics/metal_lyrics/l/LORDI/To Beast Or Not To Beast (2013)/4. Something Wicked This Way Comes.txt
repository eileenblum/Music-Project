I sense it- I feel it- It's aching in my bones
I taste it- in the air, hear it in the undertones

The birds left- no crickets
The silence sings of death
The river set on pause
The storm holding it's breath

Something wicked this way comes
Something wicked this way comes
No fights now, it's a terrorize response
Something wicked this way comes

The windows all boarded
The deadbolts are all shot
You know you're pathetic
'Cause this thing can't be stopped

While outside the sun shines
Your something's in your head
You're waiting, and waiting
Until you starve to death
