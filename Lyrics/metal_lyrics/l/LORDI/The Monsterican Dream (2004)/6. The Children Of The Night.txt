I hid them under the floor; for they being here made me soar
And on that day I felt kinda haze
Now they still gotta be there, cuss there not going anywhere
Whit served limbs - or call me crazy?
But there are voices in the darkness
In my house every time I close my eyes

In the dead of night I hear em sigh The Children of the night are calling
 Hear em cry they still defy endlessly I fell like falling now they're all
My children of the night

These skulls are so small; here are seven of them in all
I swear to god, now they're deadly silence
But still there voices in the darkness, getting louder all the time

In the dead of night I hear them sigh The Children of the night are calling
I hear a cry they still defy endlessly I fell like falling on the road
My children of the

Now little feet tap at the end of my bed
Remorse I seize
I feel theres someone leaning over my head
7 breaths, they freeze!

In the dead of night I hear them sigh The Children of the night are calling
I hear a cry they still defy endlessly I fell like falling
In the dead of night I hear them sigh The Children of the night are calling
I hear a cry they still defy endlessly I fell like falling on the road
My children of the night
