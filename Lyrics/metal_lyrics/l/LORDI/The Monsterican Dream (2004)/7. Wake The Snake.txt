Slither into your garden
I got an apple waiting for a bite
I lick my chops until the hammer drops
You know that it just might

I'm gonna spiral up higher
Wriggle up in the air
It's breaking out you can't break it down
Who said it would be fair?

Well I --
Grind your fingers
When you're hanging on the ledge
How does it feel when your life's about to end?
I'm gonna keep it coming, baby - you'll be next
You can feel my fury - kiss the fatal fangs

Tough enough to wake the snake?
Shake my rattle baby outta control
Wake the snake
With a fatal bite you'll take a fall

Sinking in my poison
Drowning in cyanide
See if I care - theres no dare
If you go run and hide

Sit on the lap of the savage
And well breed like rats
You say you wont - for heavens sake
Well just have to see about that

Well I --
Grind your fingers
When you're hanging on the ledge
How does it feel when your life's about to end?
I'm gonna keep it coming, baby - you'll be next
You can feel my fury - kiss the fatal fangs

Tough enough to wake the snake?
Shake my rattle baby outta control
Wake the snake
With a fatal bite you'll take a fall

Tough enough to wake the snake?
Shake my rattle baby outta control
Wake the snake
With a fatal bite you'll take a fall
