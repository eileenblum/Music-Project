[B-Side Track]She smiles, she's such a cutie-pie
Tempting you to come closer
She's got fire burning in her eyes
And she keeps on pushin' it, baby, keeps on pushin' it!

Touch a little feathery
Inviting you to come nearer
She's much too strong
- but so damn sweet!
And she keeps on pushin' it, baby, keeps on pushing it!

But if you ever get too close, you're gonna burn!

She will eat you up, she will spit you out
She hurt's so bad in the good way
She will slam you down, throw you around
Pitch black widow of beauty

Take cover!
Pyromite! Pyromite!

She's hot, she'll make your fever rise
Makes you feel like somehow you fading
And tonight, she'll give you a ride!
She just keeps on pushin' it, baby, keeps on pushin' it!

Feel it, like you were
And you can't, chances getting jaded
You can't breathe, the air is getting thin
She just keeps on pushing it, baby, keeps on pushing it!

But if you ever get too close, you're gonna burn!

She will eat you up, she will spit you out
She hurt's so bad in the good way
She will slam you down, throw you around
Pitch black widow of beauty

Take cover!
Pyromite! Pyromite!
Pyromite! Pyromite!

Trapped in the shadows she's bond her web
They're here to follow, your god is dead
By her fire, you can't resist
She keeps on pushin' it, baby, keeps on pushin' it

She will eat you up, she will spit you out
She hurt's so bad in the good way
She will slam you down, throw you around
Pitch black widow of beauty

Take cover!
Pyromite! Pyromite!
Pyromite! Pyromite!
Pyromite! Pyromite!
Pyromite! Pyromite!
