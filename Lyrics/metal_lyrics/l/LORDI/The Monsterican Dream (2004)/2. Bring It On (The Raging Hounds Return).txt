Hello, I am Bill, who the hell are you?
I bring the word from the dead
This is the day they shall reanimate
And get their claws on your necks"

A pack of raging wolves are howling
Awaken from their sleep of sin
Hail to the creeps - HAIL!
Thunder unleashed - HAIL!
No beasts so fierce

Bring it on, bring it on big time
Bring it on, bring it on down
Bring it on --
The rancorous return from their graves
Won't you bring it on, bring it on big time
Bring it on, bring it on down
Bring it on
Behold your town will burn
As the raging hounds return

The rampant hell dogs
Rampaging near
The unholy proliferates
They taste your blood
And they smell your fear
On your mark --
Get set --
Decapitate!

A pack of raging wolves are howling
Awaken from their sleep of sin
Hail to the creeps - HAIL!
Thunder unleashed - HAIL!
No beasts so fierce

Bring it on, bring it on big time
Bring it on, bring it on down
Bring it on --
The rancorous return from their graves
Won't you bring it on, bring it on big time
Bring it on, bring it on down
Bring it on
Behold your town will burn
As the raging hounds return

Ominous haze dispersing by the moonlights order
They got their prey - they're gone with your daughters
Claimed their souls - turned em into martyrs
They will burn - as the hounds return
