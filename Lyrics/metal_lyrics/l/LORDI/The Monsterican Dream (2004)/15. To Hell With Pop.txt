[B-Side Track]Some want it soft
Some want it hard
Some like it slow
Some like it fast as the shark

Few hate it every single way
You really need no room to play
You make it so damn hard to stay

Run away
Run away
Ooh, you better run away
Run away
Run away
Run before it's too late
The truth is right behind you
Closing in... on you!
So run away

You ain't nobody's nightmare
You weren't born in flames
You ain't no Devil's daughter
You don't know the pain
There's no 7-headed demons
No lakes of blood that drown
But on the day your black sun rises
It's you who's going down
To hell with the pop

You wipe the smile right off your face
That lifts you high above the whole human race
You think your fashion suits you fine
Your mind ain't worth of a single dime
You will be thrown down for your crimes

Run away
Run away
Ooh, you better run away
Run away
Run away
Run before it's too late
The truth is right behind you
Closing in... on you!
So run away

You ain't nobody's nightmare
You weren't born in flames
You ain't no Devil's daughter
You don't know the pain
There's no 7-headed demons
No lakes of blood that drown
But on the day your black sun rises
It's you who's going down
To hell with the pop

You ain't nobody's nightmare
You weren't born in flames
You ain't no Devil's daughter
You don't know the pain
There's no 7-headed demons
No lakes of blood that drown
But on the day your black sun rises
It's you who's going down
To hell with the pop
