You start to feel the cold
Now you believe the tales you being told.
He's here he's at your door,
The grim reaper's son we can't ignore

The age of ruin is upon us all,
Pray is just a waste of your time.
The dead walk as the master calls,
Leads the herd to the beat of the chimes

Kalmageddon - the man outta hell
Kalmageddon - he cast an evil spell,
Surrender, your soul those ho treasure the most
Kalmageddon - it's the unholy ghost.

You're counting in the dark,
The last beats of your pounding heart.
The tales you heard are true,
Your scream is silenced as the cold hands engulf you...

The ends of ruin is upon us all,
Pray is just a waste of your time.
The dead walk as the master calls,
Leads the herd to the beat of the chimes

Kalmageddon - the man outta hell
Kalmageddon - he cast an evil spell,
Surrender, your soul those ho treasure the most
Kalmageddon - it's the unholy ghost.

Fear the fortieth unholy ghost - (Kalmageddon) [4x]
