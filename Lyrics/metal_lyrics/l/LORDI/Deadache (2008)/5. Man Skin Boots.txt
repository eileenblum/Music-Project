Take a step back
Don't look her straight in the eye
Beware that you're saying

You're like a frog on the road
You know you're bound to die
Studded tires are flaying

You tried it with a knife and rope
You tried it with some poison and dynamite
You tried it by cutting the wires
With a can of gas and fire
Boy, you're so out of your league

(She wears) man skin boots
And she's not gonna please ya
No she's not gonna tease ya
She's the queen bee baby

Man skin boots
You're a bug to a spider
She's a shark, you're a slider
She's the beastess lady

Man - she's walking
Skin - she's walking
Boots - She's walking in man skin boots

You brought it on you
Yeah, you should be afraid
No one gets under her radar

She'll be vicious and cruel
You're under her blade
Now say hello to Miss Crowbar

One true alpha female puts you on the level
Messing with this broad is messing with the devil
She will make sure her lesson you will learn
Once you cross her you will never return
