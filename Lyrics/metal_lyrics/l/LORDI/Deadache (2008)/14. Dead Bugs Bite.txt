[iTunes Bonus Track]

You hear us crunching
You see us bleeding
You got us under your shoe
But we keep coming back
We keep refusing
To stay dead for you

You beat us up so bad
Like we've never had
But we still stand and holding on

Dead Bugs Bite out of spite
And we never surrender
Crush us, we wont be gone for long
Dead Bugs Bite, We will force you on your knees
You will beg for mercy for your soul

You think you've got it
You let us have it
We will be rudely exposed
But in the morning
We're still storming
Cut right into your zone

You beat us up so bad
Like we've never had
But we still stand and holding on

Dead Bugs Bite Out of spite
And we never surrender
Crush us, we wont be gone for long
Dead Bugs Bite, We will force you on your knees
You will beg for mercy for your soul

Dead Bugs Bite Out of spite
And we never surrender
Crush us, we wont be gone for long
Dead Bugs Bite, We will force you on your knees
You will beg for mercy for your soul

Sleep tight, and let those Dead bugs bite
Sleep tight, and let those Dead bugs bite
