[Digipack Bonus Track]

It's lovely to see you,
Fall off the stairs,
Breaking your skull in two

There's nothing you won't do
IV with air,
Pull the plug and say I do

Beware in the bed
I might cut off your head,
you choke me blue with the pillow tie,
this love was never alive,

[chorus:]
It was hate at first sight for us darling
The lady and the tramp rabid and snarling,
Awkward lovers and charmers worth mauling
It's a match made in hell, cupid's squalling

Your scent's fascinating
For maggots and worms,
Eating your flesh away

You say my eyes are engaging
To watch when I burn,
Going pop in the flames

Beware in the bed
I might cut off your head,
You choke me blue with the pillow tie,
This love was never alive,

[chorus x3]
