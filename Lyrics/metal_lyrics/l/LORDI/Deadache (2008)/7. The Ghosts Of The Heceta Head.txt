Deep under sea
Their watery grave's giving in
They seek relief
A lighthouse to haunt from within

Doesn't matter how long it'll take
'Cause they have found a new home
They will shatter, wreak havoc and break
The gray lady must go

From the mud
Hands of dirt and rust
They take the lighthouse over

For the worse
With a brand new curse
You won't be please at meeting
The new ghosts of the Heceta head
The ghosts of the Heceta head
Oooh-ooh-ooh

One final time
The misty gray lady appears
They bring in grime
The lighthouse will face greater fear
