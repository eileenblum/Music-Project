She cannot help herself
The voices tell her so
All sinners go to hell
She's gotta help them go

She knows it - it ain't just her fantasy
That drives her
Deep in her - the killer rose

Evilyn, you've gone too far
Nothing saves your putrid heart
There's no room in heaven anymore

Evilyn, you chose to fall
You shall fall forevermore
Evilyn, you've gone too far
'Cause your heart if made in hell

Oh she means well but who could tell
That it was all for love
Her love is twisted, bred in hell
She thinks it's from above
