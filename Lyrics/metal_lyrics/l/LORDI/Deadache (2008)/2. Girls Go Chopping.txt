Girls go chopping in the town
Female madness all around
Beauties on a killing spree
Dames of death walk on high heels

Evil women, psycho chicks
Blood like lipstick on their lips
Mad, fericious, feminine
Such curvatious mean machines

They're rising at midnight
They reek of the grave
They'll pay back betrayal with rage

Girls go chopping for revenge
Retribution night
Bring the axe down

Girls go chopping for revenge
Blood will flow on sight
Drowning our town

Girls go chopping in the town
Lady frenzy going down
Zombie babies with teasing hips
They love turning dirty tricks

Every reason to attack
No excuses for a whack
Go berserk Miss Piggy style
Kermit's legs are gonna fry
