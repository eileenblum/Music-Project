Underrated - patronized
Boiling hate is rushing in my veins
Idolized - then despised
Blood will pour down like a crimson rain

It's calm before the storm that's rising from beneath
I'll let my demons out to breathe

Raise hell in heaven - raise hell in heaven
Keepin' it all in's taking it's toll

Raise hell in heaven - raise hell in heaven
Letting inner demons take control

I am not under you
You cannot play my game and use your rules
You claim you know me better than I do
Which one of us does it make a fool?

Raise hell in heaven - raise hell in heaven
I'm who I am and this is what I do

Raise hell in heaven - raise hell in heaven
In the end you know that I won't lose

Why justify my existence all the time for you?
You hate my stubborn persistence
You know that in the end I won't lose
