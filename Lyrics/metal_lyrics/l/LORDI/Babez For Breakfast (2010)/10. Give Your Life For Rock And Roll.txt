Beat the toms, Be the fox on the kit
The Queen of shock, With black tape on your tits
Pulling teeth
Got a bass, Make it scream
Tight blue jeans, Packed with TNT
They will just be an ember
Yet your flame's burning high
They will not be remembered
Yet your sound is alive
Â 
[Chorus]
Give your life for Rock and Roll,
Your soul shall live on
Give your life for Rock and Roll,
You'll never be gone

Crank up your flying v, With the white polka dots
Tragedy, You're the diamond, red hot
Under the gun, You got Animalized
Wild and the young, With pride wearing stripes
They will just be an ember
Yet your flame's burning high
They will not be remembered
Yet your sound is alive
Â 
[Chorus]
Give your life for Rock and Roll,
Your soul shall live on
Give your life for Rock and Roll,
You'll never be gone
You'll never be gone
Â 
[Solo]

[Strange voice:]
Though you may die we still live in your presence
Our lives change while yours does not end.
From the realm of the darkness,
You bid us hear you,
That we may praise you
For ever and ever.

[Chorus]
Give your life for Rock and Roll,
Your soul shall live on
Give your life for Rock and Roll,
You'll never be gone [x2]
