Now go to sleep, count owls and sheep
You'll dive into deep, into the land of the creeps
Now let go of your soul, step inside the night
Won't be long,
You sing along
The devil's lullaby

I watch over you, come take a ride (into the night)
The face of the moon smiles down on you
Been gone for too long, now welcome home (where you belong)
Recall the devil's lullaby

The night is your friend, the morning is the enemy
The darkness transcends, the daylight brings misery
So stay away out of the sun
Where shadows cannot breathe
Don't be afraid here in the dark
You're with your family

I watch over you, come take a ride (into the night)
The face of the moon smiles down on you
Been gone for too long, now welcome home (where you belong)
Recall the devil's lullaby

[Solo]

I watch over you, come take a ride (into the night)
The face of the moon smiles down on you
Been gone for too long, now welcome home (where you belong)
Recall the devil's lullaby
RECALL THE DEVIL'S LULLABY

"...so, the question arises...what's for dinner?"
