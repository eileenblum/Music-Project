You think they are all dead,
But it's all in your head,
The zombies never left,
They're just a bit faded.

There's no way you can win,
They're on a mission to sin,
They're the rocking dead,
Shaking the jaded.

Ooh, you never got it the hair metal mayhem!
Ooh, I've heard the tons of bullshit you talk!
Now let see you WALK!

Now this is heavy metal!
No matter what you say!
Now this is heavy metal!
The only righteous way!

The horsemen they come, they sling their axes like guns
Apocalypse in neon and spandex!
The ones that you mock deliver audio shock
In the old-school hard rock vortex

Ooh, you never got it the hair metal mayhem!
Ooh, I've heard the tons of bullshit you talk!
Now let see you WALK!

Now this is heavy metal!
No matter what you say!
Now this is heavy metal!
The only righteous way!
Yeah yeah yeah! Ow!

HEAVY METAL!
HEAVY METAL!
HEAVY METAL!
HEAVY METAL!

[Solo]

Now this is heavy metal! (HEAVY METAL!)
No matter what you say! (HEAVY METAL!)
Now this is heavy metal! (HEAVY METAL!)
The only righteous way!

Now this is heavy metal!
No matter what you say!
Now this is heavy metal!
The only righteous way
[x2]

NOW THIS IS HEAVY METAL!
