Oh, ay!

Sneaking out on a Saturday night,
Mommy thinks you know wrong from right,
As you're climbing out of the window,
Something tells you to stop!
But the damned beat is luring you in,
With a promise of excess and sin
You're afraid to step across the threshold,
But it's too late now to get out!
It drags you in and slams you down!

[Chorus:]
It's discoevil, toxic tones,
It's discoevil, grinding bones
Red, hot and steaming,
Sweat, blood and screaming
It's discoevil, brutal sound,
It's discoevil, lethal pound
Flesh searing lasers,
Mirror balls with razors
The discoevil!

On the dance floor the flesh undulates,
All the oil mixed with blood lubricates
As your body gets torn asunder
It's sick but it's turning you on!
You should go but you don't wanna leave,
So you scream out of horror and need
The duality makes you wonder
It tastes like hell! Hm, oh, well!
Yeah you know you'll come back again

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, yeah!

[Solo]

On pins and needles
The ultimate Saturday night
Feast of the demons
Under the neon lights!

[Chorus]
