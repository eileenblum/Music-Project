"We have the right to break the silence!
Anything we play can and will be used against you!
In a court of ROCK!"

Horrors have a smell and they tell us it's the scene of a crime.
Case is on the floor, there's a purpose, gonna do some time
We can hear the evidence that echoes in the air.
Using choke holds, bruising nerves, morons get what they deserve!

SLASH AND BURN, PROTECT AND SERVE!

Justice in leather uniform (we prosecute transgression!)
Crashing through windows, breaking doors (we practice devastation law)

[Chorus:]
We are the rock police â elite of rock and roll's finest
We are the rock police â marshals out on patrol
We are the rock police â elite of rock and roll's finest
We are the rock police â the force keeping control
WE ARE THE ROCK!

Get you on the ground, then rub your face in the dirt
Mister Nightstick will crack your skull, now it might hurt
We're the judge, we're the jury, we're the executioners
The prime suspect will get the chair,
Voltage maxed out, skin shaved bare

INHALING HIS OWN BURNING HAIR!

Justice in leather uniform (we prosecute transgression!)
Crashing through windows, breaking doors (we practice devastation law)

[Chorus]

Justice in leather uniform (we prosecute transgression!)
Crashing through windows, breaking doors (we practice devastation law)

[2x]
We are the rock police â elite of rock and roll's finest
We are the rock police â marshals out on patrol
We are the rock police â elite of rock and roll's finest
We are the rock police â the force keeping control

WE ARE THE ROCK!
