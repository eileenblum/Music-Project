[Japanese Bonus Track]Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Bound together, sown in hell.
Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.

No matter what you do you won't sneak under my radar.
No matter where you hide I will smell your scent of fear.
No matter who you trust I will find my way to.

You will never get away from me.
You never will be breaking free.
You bleed and plead for mercy.
But you got the debt, I gotta collect.

Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Bound together, sown in hell.
Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Do you hear what you say?
Do you think that you're sane?

No matter what you show your exhibits are excluded.
No matter what you do your defence is overruled.
I know about yourself how to help better that.

You will never get away from me.
You never will be breaking free.
You bleed and plead for mercy.
But you got the debt, I gotta collect.

Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Bound together, sown in hell.
Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Do you hear what you say?
Do you think that you're sane?

Studs and leather, sown in hell. [4x]
Hay!

Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Bound together, sown in hell.
Studs and leather, devil's wardrobe.
Do you hear what you say?
Do you think that you're sane? [2x]
Hay!
