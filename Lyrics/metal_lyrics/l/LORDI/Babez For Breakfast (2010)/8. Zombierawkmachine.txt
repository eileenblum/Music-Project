You know it's coming, the earth shakes
You hear it's knocking like hell at the gates
You cannot help it, you let go
You raise your fist and your hair starts to grow
And the masses are marching to this groovy beat
The living dead dancing out in the streets

[Chorus:]
It's the zombie rock machine (yeah yeah)
It's the zombie rock machine (yeah yeah)
It's the zombie rock machine (yeah yeah)
It's the zombie rock machine (yeah yeah)

Oh, yeah!
Huh!

Gray-skinned heads banging, some get loose
Rocking and rolling in wet gory mousse
Fists pounding, Dead feet tap
Rock hard until the worms make the spines snap
And the masses are marching to this groovy beat
The living dead dancing out in the streets

[Chorus]

Ooh-ooo-ooo
Ooh-ooo-ooo
Ooh-ooo-ooo
Ooh-ooo-ooo

[Solo]

[Chorus x2]
