[Japanese Bonus Track]In the daylight she feels some tight,
She needs to live a life by the moon.
Oh, it's alright though there's sometimes,
A sacrificial slaughter in your tomb.

She could never be,
Some way that I would not be just a bit afraid.
But it's OK,
Cause love is blind and gone insane.

Oh, Lord have mercy on the devil's daughter.
You know she could not choose who'll be her father.
Now let her drown herself in holy water.
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! [2x]

No denying that she's trying,
But narrow-minded people still appall.
Neighbors wailing, their complaining,
Few get some missing but they'll have some more.

She could never be,
Some way that I would not be just a bit afraid.
But it's OK,
Cause love is blind and gone insane.

Oh, Lord have mercy on the devil's daughter.
You know she could not choose who'll be her father.
Now let her drown herself in holy water.
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! [2x]

Many possessions, investigations.
You're in to something, way more loving.
She's breathing fire, drawing her wire burn out.

Oh, Lord have mercy on the devil's daughter.
You know she could not choose who'll be her father.
Now let her drown herself in holy water.
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! [2x]
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!
