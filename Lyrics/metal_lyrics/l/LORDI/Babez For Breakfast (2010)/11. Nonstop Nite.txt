Hey!

I'm gonna rise when the daylight's low,
All dressed to kill and all systems go,
You'll be staring on my late night show!

Sure you can run, but you'll be too slow,
I hate to tell you that I told you so,
Well that's a lie, but I know you know!

At the stroke of midnight it's the hunting season,
I go on instinct and I need no reason
I'm driven crazy by the scent of prey,
I won't let you get away!

I'm a serpent in heat,
And I'm hungry for meat,
I constrict and bite,
Non-stop nite!
I'm the carnivore Rex,
Sinking fangs in your flesh,
Say bye bye light,
It's non-stop nite!

Oh, oh
Non-stop Nite!
Oh, oh,
Non-stop Nite!
Wow!

I hate to quit because the sun comes up,
I've got some good news for you now, guess what,
I'll bar the doors, and nail the windows shut,
I smash the clocks and then time will freeze,
Drag out the night to keep you on your knees,
Now we can have fun for eternity!

At the stroke of midnight it's the hunting season,
I go on instinct and I need no reason
I'm driven crazy by the scent of prey,
I won't let you get away!

I'm a serpent in heat,
And I'm hungry for meat,
I constrict and bite,
Non-stop nite!
I'm the carnivore Rex,
Sinking fangs in your flesh,
Say bye bye light,
It's non-stop nite!

Whoooa, whoooa!
Non-stop nite!
Whoooa, whoooa!
Non-stop nite!

Whoooa, whoooa!
