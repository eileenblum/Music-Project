Entering my Hellywood Hills
The vulture's moving in for the kill
Faces of the prey turning white (Ah)
My maw was ready to bite

Put your hands up nobody moves
Ki-ki-ki-ki-killer's got the groove

[Chorus:]
Boohoohoohoo, I'm bigger than you!
Boohoohoohoo, yeah, you!
Boohoohoohoo, I do what I want to!
Boohoohoohoo, And I want to do you!

Yeah!

Hang yourself up high on the hooks
The more skin rips the better it looks
You're free to scream whatever you feel (Uh!)
But you're still under my heal

Put your hands up nobody moves
Ki-ki-ki-ki-killer's got the groove

[Chorus]

I'm bigger than you!

All your clothes are torn and tattered
Broken fingers, teeth all shattered
When your body meets my ice drill
There are more holes I can fill
Now let's get busy

[Solo]

[Chorus]

I want to do you!
Hey!
