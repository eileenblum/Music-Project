[lyrics: Mooneyman]

I can't hear what people say,
How could I have lost my way.
Too much noise in my head,
My family wishes I was dead!

You can't tell me what to do,
But I don't know, do I know you?
I can't see anyone I know,
Now, what's going on?

Everything is so wrong, so everything's gotta go,
Tomorrow can wait, today I'm losing control,
By hook or by crook
I'll make things go by the book,
I'm taking back my life today!

Granny's gone crazy,
She's out tonight,
Granny's gone crazy,
Gone out of her mind, oh
Granny's gone crazy,
And she's a fright,
Granny's out for blood!

Neon lights blind my sight
Keep me awake, can't sleep at night,
It's all porn on TV,
The whole world's gotten too obscene

Little girls dressing up like whores,
Mother's too fat to fit out the door,
Grown men dressing up like girls,
This is not my world!

Everything is so wrong, so everything's gotta go,
Tomorrow can wait, today I'm losing control,
By hook or by crook
I'll make things go by the book,
I'm taking back my life today!

Granny's gone crazy,
She's out tonight,
Granny's gone crazy,
Gone out of her mind, oh
Granny's gone crazy,
And she's a fright,
Granny's out for blood!

"- Daddy, is granny doing alright?"
"- Sure, honey, why do you even ask?"
"- I think she's acting really weird."
"- Ha, ha, no honey, your granny is just fine..."

[x2]
Granny's gone crazy,
She's out tonight,
Granny's gone crazy,
Gone out of her mind, oh
Granny's gone crazy,
And she's a fright,
Granny's out for blood!
