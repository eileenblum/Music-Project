You were about eleven when your sister pissed you off,
You chopped off her finger and ate it in a hot dog,
You just smile, and shook your head,
The next time she know she'll be dead,
You seem mild, no one knows,
Till you explode!

You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like nitro on fire!
You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like a high tension wire

(Rock! Out!)
Loud and loaded!
(Rock! Out!)
Loud and loaded!!

Hahahaha

25 December and your brother's baby cried,
Threw it out the window just to see if it could fly!
Mom and dad were kinda sad,
They nagged you on 'til you got mad,
They never learned, so you lit the match,
And watched them burn!

You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like nitro on fire!
You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like a high tension wire

You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like nitro on fire!
You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
You're loud and loaded!

Loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like nitro on fire!
You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like a high tension wire

You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like nitro on fire!
You're loud and loaded!
You're Rock and Roll!
Like a high tension wire

(Rock! Out!)
Loud and loaded!
(Rock! Out!)
Loud and loaded!
(Rock! Out!)
Loud and loaded!
(Rock! Out!)

Loud!
