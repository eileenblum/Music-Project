Down the isle, your beauty's blinding
All dressed in white, I see you shining,
Although today there's not a cloud in the sky,
But still I've got this haunting feeling,
I fear this day will end up in tears...

[Chorus:]
Call off the wedding now,
bad things are coming down
My demons will soon be here
Oh, yeah!
Call off the wedding, dear,
bad things are drawing near,
Oh, Lord, my demons are here,
Oh, yes, my demons are here!

Young flower girls, so cute and cuddly,
Their heads soon whirl so brute and ugly
I know their eyes will turn as red as your rose,
don't say you'll take me till the end of time,
Bells have an ominous chime

[Chorus x2]
