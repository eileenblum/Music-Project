Pigtails
The cutest smiles
But it's all delusion

Kneesocks
The sweetest eyes
It's just a grand illusion

When they're bad
They just get better
Like saints full of sin
And again the constrictor queens
Will shed their skin

All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad

She-Lurks
In a girl disguise
You'll fall into confusion

Now they might
Play it nice
But you're heading for an execution

When they're bad
They just get better
Like saints full of sin
And again the constrictor queens
Will shed their skin

All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good
They know it's good

All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad

All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad
