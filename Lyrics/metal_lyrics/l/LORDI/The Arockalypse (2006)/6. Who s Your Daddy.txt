Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All the vixens stand in line
Waiting for my fright night
Be the new flesh for the sacrifice

Screaming out the mating call
I've become the lord of love

I break your will
I'll break your will for good
I treat you like a brute

Who's your daddy,
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
Who's your daddy,
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Surrender and obey, who's your daddy?

Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She's a battle-ax in pinstripes
Get ready for your prime time
Max out the triple-X-drive

Screaming out the mating call
I've become the lord of love

I break your will
I'll break your will for good
I treat you like a brute

Who's your daddy,
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
Who's your daddy,
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Surrender and obey, who's your daddy?

Get down, get down
Lay down, lay down
Stay down, stay down
For daddy

Get down, get down
Lay down, lay down
Stay down, stay down
Uh! Uh!

Who's your daddy,
Say, who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy,
Girl, who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy,
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Who keeps you in line?

Who's your daddy,
Say, who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy,
Girl, who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy,
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Who keeps you in line?

Who's your daddy,
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
Who's your daddy,
Bitch, who's your daddy?
Surrender and obey, who's your daddy?

Who's your daddy,
Say, who's your daddy?
Who puts you in your place?
