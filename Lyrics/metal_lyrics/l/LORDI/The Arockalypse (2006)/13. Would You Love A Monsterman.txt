Would you love a monsterman
Could you understand
Beauty of the beast

Yeah I would kill
Yeah I would freeze all hell over
Just to get a chill

Yeah I would slay
Yeah I would mame
Yeah I would vanish in thin air
And reappear again

Be right in the squares
Yeah I would be sincere
Yeah I would lie
Yeah I would lie
Yeah I would be there
Waking up the dead to get a thrill
I say yeah, I say yeah

[Chorus:]
Would you love a monsterman
Could you understand
Beauty of the beast
I would do it all for you
Would you do it all
Do it all for me

Take the time
You'll be fine
Yeah there is nothing wrong with this
You ain't commit no crime

You don't know why
We pass you by
You search for something never found
Along these lines

Someday you may turn around and terrify
You can't deny-you crucify
Would you get down in the gutter
Swallowing your pride
I say yeah, I say yeah

[Chorus]

All that you get
Is much less than you deserve
Leaving for now
Someday I may return

Would you love a monsterman?

[Chorus x2]
