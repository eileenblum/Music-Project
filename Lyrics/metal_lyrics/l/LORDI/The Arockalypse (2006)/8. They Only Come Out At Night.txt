You know you saw them but no-one ever listens
They'll be long gone by the time the sun has risen

You feel 'em lurking, hear 'em howling in the shadows
Wreaking havoc on your perfect world

They are the tricking trolls
They got the bell that tolls
Flash at the edge of your sight

They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night

The shadows breathe with a venom like no other
A silent evil where there shouldn't be another, no no

I feel 'em lurking, hear 'em howling in the shadows
Wreaking havoc on your perfect world

They are the tricking trolls
They got the bell that tolls
Flash at the edge of your sight

They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night

Don't know what's at stake
I think they're right beside me
I gotta stay awake
And keep them all from biting

They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night

They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night

They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night

They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
