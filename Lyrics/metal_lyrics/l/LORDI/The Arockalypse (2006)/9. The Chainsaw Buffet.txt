You got your invitation
A family dinner, and tonight you will meet

No need for hesitation, sugar
We're gonna love you and it's all we can eat

The steaks ala carte mama makes from the heart
And my pa's such a gourmet for gore
Jammed eyes, bleeding herbs
Banquet dining is worth dying for

At the chainsaw - chainsaw buffet
The secret ingredient screams
You're my main course
At the chainsaw buffet
Feed on man-eaters's cuisine
At the chainsaw - chainsaw buffet

Mother said that you were a sweet chic
Called upon your folks, and they'll join us for brunch

Nice day for a picnic
They'll be delighted, only they are the lunch

The steaks ala carte mama makes from the heart
And my pa's such a gourmet for gore
Jammed eyes, bleeding herbs
Banquet dining is worth dying for

At the chainsaw - chainsaw buffet
The secret ingredient screams
You're my main course
At the chainsaw buffet
Feed on man-eaters's cuisine
(Boiling your blood 'till it steams)
At the chainsaw - chainsaw buffet
