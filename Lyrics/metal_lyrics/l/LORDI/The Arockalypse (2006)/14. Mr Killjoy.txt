Your shindig's kinda boring
Shall I strike the punch with cianede
I gotta warn you
You'll need a coroner tonight

If you see me, better flee me
If you hear me, better fear me
I'll help you from the fryer
Into the fire

[Chorus:]
Na, na na na na
Calling Mr Killjoy
I'm the death of every party
Na, na na na na
Calling Mr Killjoy
And I don't care if you don't like me, NO!

Though I'm here to fix your troubles
Brute force applied with some finess
Oh, when people are the problem
My hatchet always works the best (Oh yes it will)

If you see me, better flee me
If you hear me, better fear me
I'll help you from the fryer
Into the fire

[Chorus]

I made you suffer and it doesn't feel right
I thought my knife would snuff you out like a light
How rude of me
A quick beheading will end your fright

[Chorus x2]
