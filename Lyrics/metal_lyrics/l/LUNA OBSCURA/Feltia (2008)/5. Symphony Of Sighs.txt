My wounds are open...and I bleed
Time passing by so fast
But I'm standing here alone
Living forever into my past

Empty tears...from broken eyes
Frozen fears...from twisted minds
My wounds are made of lies
Can't you hear? the symphony?
The symphony of sighs

Rise I hear a voice to whisper
From the silence you're buried
Burn all your memories
Fly away to heavens

Empty words...from empty hearts
Bloody touches...from faithless hands
My wounds are made of lies
Can't you hear? the symphony?
The symphony of sighs
