A new Era will begin
When I will rise to my throne
Dark Clouds in the sky
Your eyes will never see the dawn

With spells and witchcraft
I'm chained below
And the birds can't fly
Above the ocean of loss

I AM THE ANCIENT ONE
MY NAME IS WRITTEN IN TIME
I AM THE FLESHLESS
I AM THE WATCHER AT THE END OF LIFE

Behold my kingdom
When The dead will rise
Spirits that once were good
Now bring me lives

With hearts and emotions
I will feed my hunger
With fear and pain
I will lead my hunters

I AM THE ANCIENT ONE
MY NAME IS WRITTEN IN TIME
I AM THE FLESHLESS
I AM THE WATCHER AT THE END OF LIFE
