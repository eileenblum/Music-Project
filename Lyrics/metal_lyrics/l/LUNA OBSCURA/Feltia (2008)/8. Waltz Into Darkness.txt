As you dance by beloved indolence
You show your body with indifference
Your eyes as in portrait are following me
And I hear your silent thoughts

Silent stranger come
And embrace me with your arms
I fear the storm in your eyes

I know there are eyes
The saddest eyes of all
That have no precious secrets to conceal
...deeper and emptier than the skies themselves
Those eyes are staring in my soul
Where I am?
Those masks of shame are staring me
With eyes of secret desires and lust

Forbidden in light
Forgotten by life

Silent stranger come
And embrace me with your arms
I fear the storm in your eyes

In these endless halls of insanity
I am your light you are my wings
An angel forgotten by the sun
Hiding behind the masks of shame
Who are you? Are you the one?
Untouchable from the human suffering
That reigns behind these walls

Long lost love I see you are
A gift from heaven denied

How can I trust my eyes
When my mind is lost
Into the perfume of illusions

How can I trust my ears
When the voices are screams
From my deepest nightmares
