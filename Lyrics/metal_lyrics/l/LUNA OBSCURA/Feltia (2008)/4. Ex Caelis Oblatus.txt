Behold the mistress of the night
She has the dream of loss
That walks upon the fire
The scream into the void

She gives the kiss of death
She breathes the pain
On fallen angels faces
She tastes your tears

DARKNESS BEHOLD YOUR INFERNAL BEAUTY
THE GRIEF THE PAIN, AND THE LUST
REVEAL TO ME ALL
YOUR ANCIENT SECRETS
THAT SILENTLY BREEDS IN YOURS HEART

Forgotten is her name
She has the silence
Forbidden is her sight
Of her sleepless nights

With the grace of the swan
In the shapeless halls
She's whispering her spells
Of nothing she lives

DARKNESS BEHOLD YOUR INFERNAL BEAUTY
THE GRIEF THE PAIN, AND THE LUST
REVEAL TO ME ALL
YOUR ANCIENT SECRETS
THAT SILENTLY BREEDS IN YOURS HEART

She holds gently in her hands
She has the wind of despair
The hearts of dead lovers
That blows into her life

With empty eyes she's staring
She is seeking the grief
The fall of her sanity
Into the souls of fools
