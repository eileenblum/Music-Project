Yet there is another
Whose name is never pronounced
Because he's been exiled from both heaven and hell
Cursed being in every kingdom,spiritual or material
His name erased from every book and every sign
His icon Scratched out in every land where people would seek for it
In order to worship him
He is an outcast and in the human hearts he causes terrible fear
The dead awaken at his call
Even the sun vanishes from the sky
