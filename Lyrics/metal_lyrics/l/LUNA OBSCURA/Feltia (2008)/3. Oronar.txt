Lies bitter words you hide
Into your empty heart
From now to then to future and past
You always wear the mask of lust

Scars from the past are my words
Hollow I am
I give fake hope
Waiting from someone to hold on
A stranger for a moment of love

CRY ME A LIE FEAR MY WORDS
DESPERATE CRIES FILLING OUR LOVE
The art of sin within you hide
Screaming thoughts into my mind
Upon your skin some moments of pleasure
Your kiss cold as ice
Into your eyes a dying light

I fear the loneliness
No more pain for me, no more tears
I'm lost into my sick mind
Afraid to face my deepest fears

I found my self in despair...
...with tears in my eyes...
I'm longing for the darkest hours
Where I will be all alone...

Forever gone and never been forgotten
Never been forgiven for this tragedy
Like the taste of Judas kiss...
