Like tormented souls we're lying on the ground
Tears of the secrets are stained on our skin
Shall we ever feel again the warmth of sun
At the end of night we'll die like our dreams

Velvet are the thorns that making us to bleed
Silent are the moments of our own desires
Shall we ever hear again our silent screams
At the end of day we'll become the fire

The burden of solitude......

...and we are longing for the unknown
Where destiny is not a part of it
A veil of black grace is covering our eyes
Blinded we are following our hearts...
Oceans of past

(and I whisper in the moon:
"Sear me with your light...bare me from my burden
Take away my pain...and leave me alone
And leave me again...in my cold eternity....")

Like forgotten angels we're buried in the ashes
Words of lust and sadness are written in our hands
Shall we ever see again the light of pain
At the end of life we'll return in dust

Forbidden are the hopes that will bring us joy
Hopeless we are walking the path of ignorance
Shall we ever dream again the paradise
At the end of time we'll become the shadows

The burden of solitude......
