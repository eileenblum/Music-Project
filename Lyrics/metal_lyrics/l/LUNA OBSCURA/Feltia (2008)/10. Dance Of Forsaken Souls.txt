These moments are empty without you
And the tears run down my face
Alone I am
My heart bleeds...for...you

You left me with scars
Memories of yesterday
You left me with tears
Lost dreams of lifetime

I'm dying can't you see
Your silence hurts more
I'm crying a thousand tears
For you...only...for...you

You left me with scars
Memories of yesterday
You left me with tears
Lost dreams of (a) lifetime

Silent thoughts
Words of lies
Wounded love
Tearful eyes

Come with me into my darkness
For last time to feel your touch
Hear my screams and all my thoughts
Feel my dying frozen heart
Let me take you to a dance
The dance of the forsaken souls
Where our love is dying
Where the shadows mourn
