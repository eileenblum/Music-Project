If you're looking for another excuse
To open your fucking mouth
Look no further, sure you'll find plenty of material here
Most people only live to move the dirt that they are buried with
that they are buried with
I'll never give up
I will not bow my head
I'll throw my fist up
Your inexperience can't possibly create a valid argument
You're lost in your own life
Make your mistakes on your own time

Lack any motivation just to make simple decisions
Walk around with desperation in your heart and hate in your eyes
It takes some nerve to know you've done nothing for yourself
yet you still question the motives of someone else
You think talking makes you a big man?
Why don't you make something of yourself and then you'll understand
I'd ask you to walk a mile in my shoes
But you're too close minded
Deeper meaning is beneath you

Sometimes I think you're trying to be ignorant
I worked for every shred of success
You're just so apathetic

There's nothing wrong with knowing what it takes to succeed
You can keep this town I'll take everything that I want and ill leave
So strange you're quiet face to face
What a coincidence
You're so bold and confident when you're hiding on the Internet

You don't approve of how I carry myself?
Come again?
Come again?
Don't give a fuck about you so keep my name out of your mouth
You didn't know me then
You don't know me now
How can you preach how much I've changed when you don't even know yourself?

It's almost laughable
Act like you're so free from guilt
Every time I hear you're name I cringe
You're just so weak willed
You're just so weak willed
Every time you speak my name I cringe you're just so hate filled

Lack any motivation just to make simple decisions
Walk around with desperation in your heart and hate in your eyes
It takes some nerve to know you've done nothing for yourself
Yet you still question the motives of someone else
You think talking makes you a big man?
Why don't you make something of yourself and then you'll understand
I'd ask you to walk a mile in my shoes
But you're too close minded
Deeper meaning is beneath you

Sometimes I think you're trying to be ignorant
I worked for every shred of success
You're just so apathetic

There's nothing wrong with knowing what it takes to succeed
You can keep this town ill take everything that I want and I'll leave
So strange you're quiet face to face
What a coincidence
You're so bold and confident when you're hiding on the Internet

You could have anything that you want
But you just sit there. Just sit there and talk
And I feel pity
Not for where you'll end up
But for who you've become
You'll never understand because you think you think you're up above
When I've been fighting for everything I love
You have been challenging my trust
Now you're slipping away
No one has any desire to save
Someone that only acts to save face
I feel pity
Not for where you'll end up
But for who you've become
