If I was the Devil
I would bring everyone else down to my level
I would create a living hell in
Order to prepare
An attempt to make every evil word somewhat easier to utter
But that's not me
I'm no saint but I tried to be good, I tried so hard to be understood
You always accuse me of so much
All I can hear are their voices screaming for my blood
You say that I'm the one who fooled you but the honest truth
The honest truth is that I'm the fool
I truly changed for you
But the change in me could never be enough for you

You showed me how good this life could be
but I should've known that losing you would destroy me
I knew how dark this world could be
and now I'm right here trapped inside this distance and it's killing me

Now the world is dead and it's my burden to bear
I live inside of my head this is my punishment
For destroying every shred of humanity that was left
That was left inside of me
I've destroyed so many lives
How did it come to this
I close my eyes and hope I'm someone
Else when I open them
Too many lies now I can't remember
The drugs have made every moment bleed together
I can't believe how fucking far I've fallen
Thought I had this under control, I got lost in the moment
Sometimes you have to lose control,
Numb the fuck up and go with the flow

You showed me how good this life could be
but I should've known that losing you would destroy me
I knew how dark this world could be
and now I'm right here trapped inside this distance and its killing me

The one you loved is dead and buried
He thought he'd get the last laugh, thought he'd get the best of me
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
HA HA HA
Numb up so I can't give a fuck

You showed me how good this life could be
but I should've known that losing you would destroy me
I knew how dark this world could be
and now I'm right here trapped inside this distance and its killing me
You showed me how good this life could be
but I should've known that losing you would destroy me
I knew how dark this world could be
and now I'm right here trapped inside this distance and its killing me
And it's killing me
Yeah, it's killing me
