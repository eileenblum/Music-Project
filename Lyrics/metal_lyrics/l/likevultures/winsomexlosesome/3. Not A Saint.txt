Well I am sorry, I am not a saint
I wasn't raised that way
Fight for what you love
And watch it fade away
I gave you every piece of me
And now you're taking that away

I'm forever on the edge of failure
Always wondering what it will take to make this heart of mine
To finally feel at, feel at home

I want the part of you
That you refuse to give
The walls you've built around your soul
Will soon wear thin
I know it's hard to let me in
But I swear
That if we stand together
We'll never fall apart
And you will never have to suffer
I will hold on to your heart
You need to find a way
To make it through the day, through the day

I know that is asking a lot from someone like you
I know you're capable,
So don't throw me away
So don't throw me away
We said that we would not allow
Each other to go to waste
To go to waste

I want the part of you that
You refuse to give
The walls you've built around
Your soul will soon wear thin
I know it's hard to let me in
But I swear that if we stand together
We'll never fall apart
And you will never have to suffer
I will hold on to your heart
You need to find a way
To make it through the day, through the day

And now I'm standing around with nothing left to say
There's always something to lose
Learned that the hard way
So sorry I'm not a saint
I wasn't raised that way
But you'll learn that the hard way
Fuck what they say
It's time you learned the hard way

So sorry I'm not a saint
I wasn't raised that way
There's always something to lose
Learned that the hard way

I want the part of you that
You refuse to give
The walls you've built around
Your soul will soon wear thin
I know it's hard to let me in
But I swear that if we stand together
We'll never fall apart
And you will never have to suffer
I will hold on to your heart
You need to find a way
To make it through the day, through the day

I want your soul
