I finally see this is bigger than you and me

I fell asleep I was comatose
Fought through the nightmare,
finally woke up 18 months ago
Stood up and went for what I wanted the most
Now I am hated, I'm despised
Struggle to see the path through bloodshot eyes

I guess I shouldn't be surprised
Everyone I knew before acts like I've lost my life
They say:
"Good things come to those who wait,
greatness occurs when you can fight through the hate"
I'm talking like I got something to prove,
but chasing my dreams is all I'm trying to do

I finally see the light
All I need now is a little more time
You got what you wanted and someday I'll get mine
I know I'll never try to fill the void that you left behind in me

I played it over again
Trying to silence the ghosts that you left in my head
I never want to forget
I never want to pretend
That this didn't destroy me
You are the one that fills my heart and head

I play a long hand and I hold my cards close
Why wouldn't I when you were everything I wanted the most
I'll never give up
I'll never let you go
This isn't bigger than us
This is my last hope
This is my last hope

I finally see the light
All I need now is a little more time
You got what you wanted and someday I'll get mine
I know I'll never try to fill the void that you left behind in me

So when the moment comes
That I am asked my dying wish
I will close my eyes and take myself back
And I will say let me see her again

'll surrender the moment you forgive me for my past
But we know that would never last
I refuse to live in the past

There's no way you can hurt me I've already lost what I had to lose
What I had to lose
Yeah,
lost what I had to lose
When I lost you

Realized that I was truly dead inside
So I started to fight
Started to see the light
Glared at the sun for the very first time
Now I know what's inside
know how I want to live this life

I finally see the light
All I need now is a little more time
You got what you wanted and someday I'll get mine
I know I'll never try to fill the void that you left behind in me
