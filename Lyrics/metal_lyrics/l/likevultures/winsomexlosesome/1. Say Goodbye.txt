I finally realize that I just bring you down

Didn't know myself when I got off the road
When I got back I didn't feel at home
But then I met you
Showed me a side of life I had never known
Everything was so perfect
Never questioning was this worth it
Of course I knew the risk
But I never thought you couldn't handle it

I'll never understand
How we can go from that to this
Keep telling myself it's just a bad trip
When everything is going so damn right
Break it off before you feel the sting of life
I broke your heart, you fixed mine
Now that we're out of time
I hope you realize
That I can almost feel my arms around you
And I still see you when I close my eyes
I can't stand another day without you
You know I'd drop everything just to be there
Just to be by your side
Yeah I know it's my fault you're leaving
Can't watch you go tonight

Now I know how it feels to say goodbye
Goodbye

Okay I'm gonna get a little bit real,
'Cause there's a couple different feelings that I need you to feel like,
How could you give up
When you knew all along
You were everything to me
You ruined my favorite songs
So fuck everything else 'cause I was always there for you when no one wanted to help
Maybe I put you through hell, but fighting everyday ain't so good for my head
I hope that you still see me when you close your eyes

I hope you realize
That I can almost feel my arms around you
And I still see you when I close my eyes
I can't stand another day without you
Yeah I know it's my fault you're leaving
Why you're leaving tonight
So hard to say goodbye

I never wanted to share myself with anybody else
You knew that, I could tell
Hey, Hey
Don't say goodbye
I never want you to change
Love you the way you are
You'll always have a place in my heart
Now I realize that I just bring you down

It's gonna be so hard to live without you
So glad I see you when I close my eyes
Well I could never fall in love without you
It's hard as hell to say goodbye
Please don't Say Goodbye
