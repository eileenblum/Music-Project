When you lose everything that brings you comfort
Will you give up?
Will you let go?
When you lose everything that brings you comfort
And all you have left is yourself
Will you fall down or will you fight the urge to drop your arms?
Will you let go?

Come on get up if you know the drill you know it's never time to stop
you gotta drown that anger and push past everything that you think you need
You only need yourself,
Only as strong as your weakest link
Only as strong as your weakest link
So If you let go tell me where you'll wind up
Gotta make your way can't depend on blind luck
So If you let go tell me where you'll wind up
Gotta make your way can't depend on blind luck

Lost confused and alone
And maybe your heart has never felt at home
But you know one thing that no one else knows
And that's how much you've already been through
You did what you had to

When you lose everything that brings you comfort
And all you have left is yourself
Will you fall down or will you fight the urge to drop your arms?
Will you let go?
