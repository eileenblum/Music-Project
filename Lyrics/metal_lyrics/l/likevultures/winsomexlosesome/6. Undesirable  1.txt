Come on

My names been dragged through the dirt
Love me, but suspect me first
You probably assume the worst
But that's okay, I did this myself
You'll ask but I'll never tell
You'll never know me that well
You'll never know me that well

'Cause I'm a snake in the grass
Talk shit, don't take it back
Look close and you'll see
The real despicable me
I tried, I fucking tried and I tried
I'm just too easy to despise
Today I woke up to a miserable scene
Saw my reflection saw the absolute worst in me
Insane, crazy in the worst way
What's crazy is how fast things can change
When they are going your way
Now I've got nothing left
Can't even find the words to say
I finally lost my mind
I finally ran out of time
All or nothing

I know I've just lost my way,
but I never meant to leave such a broken path of pain
Give me a chance please I'll explain
Different perspectives through different eyes
We're not the same
I'm out of touch with everything that I should probably feel inside

I am the worst person I know
I never had a heart and I just sold my soul
All my friends are dead, my girlfriend left,
and I've got way too many voices inside of my head
They're screaming
"I am the worst person I know"
You want a heart to hear?
I'll let you know
I am the worst person I know

I will not be found
I'll give you the run around
The second you see inside of me I know you'll back out
I grew up with a voice in my head
And honestly without that voice I'd probably be dead
Please don't wait for the prodigal son
He almost came back, but he was having too much fun
He's dead and gone and we knew it along
Each time I give in the temptation is too strong

And now I'm back here again
Been wearing masks so long that now I don't know where to fit in
Every night I lose it
All of the choices that I've made tighten the noose till it fits

Hide behind so many masks
Try so hard it never lasts
The darkness inside of me
Just wants to set itself free

I know I've just lost my way,
but I never meant to leave such a broken path of pain
Give me a chance please I'll explain
Different perspectives through different eyes
We're not the same
I'm out of touch with everything that I should probably feel inside

I am the worst person I know
I never had a heart and I just sold my soul
All my friends are dead, my girlfriend left,
and I've got way to many voices inside my head
They're screaming:
"I am the worst person I know"
You want a heart to heart?
I'll let you know
I am the worst person I know.
