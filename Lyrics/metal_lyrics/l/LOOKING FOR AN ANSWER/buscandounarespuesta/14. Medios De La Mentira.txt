[EspaÃ±ol:]

Has hecho monopolio tu verdad. Has hecho de la mentira tu realidad. as definido quien es bueno y quien es malo. Has definido que es paz y que es violencia. Has definido quien es el opresor y quien el oprimido. Has conseguido que le evidencia haya sido ignorada. Has conseguido que la coherencia haya sido olvidada. Medios de la mentira.

[English translation:]

[Media of the Lie]

You've made your own truth out of the monopoly. You've made your own reality out of the lies. You've defined for us who's the good and who's the bad. You've defined for us what's peace and what's violence. You've defined for us who's the oppressor and who's the oppressed. You made possible the oblivion of what we once knew as coherence. Media of the lie.
