Violent, thing of fury,
Evil wrought destruction,
War cry, sounds like 1000 lions

First drops of their blood,
Swore an oath upon it,
Kill them all, or kill our selves,

I grab the first one,
Stick a blade in his neck,
I grab the one to his right,
And remove his head,

Impaling all we see,
With sword and spear,
Fists soaked in human blood,
The smell of gore attract the Keres,

WAR!
METAL!

Amidst the slaughter,
The Keres start to swarm,
Skin stained with blood of men,
Fanged, taloned whores,

As the drag the fallen,
Vulture over those who've died,
Dragging souls to Hades,
Drinking blood till satisfied,

"Let us win this glory,
Or yield to these clawing beasts!"
