On a blood run,
Another rugged trail,
In the midst of my labors,
As I descry,
the man-beast Pholos,
With an offering,
By the order of the Gods,

Holy gift of Bacchus,
Awaiting centuries,
This ancient spirit,
Bewitch the Kentauroi,

These savage tribes arise,
All grabbing weapons
I see the craze in their eyes,
But I'm never stricken,

Attacking from all sides,
They see the rage in my eyes,

Fist in the sky,
To my enemies,
Prepare to die!
Red fills my sight
With animosity,
Triumph to night!

SLAUGHTER THE BEASTIAL LEGION!!!
SLAUGHTER THE BEASTIAL LEGION!!!

Hammer down! Hack their legs off,
Split the man from horse in two,
Cut him down! Cave his head in,
Poison burns their fatal wounds,

Two escape my wrath,
I hunt them down,
A merciless attack,
And kill Kheiron,
Drenched with blood,
The Gods grant me,
By the will of Strife,
Immortality!!!
