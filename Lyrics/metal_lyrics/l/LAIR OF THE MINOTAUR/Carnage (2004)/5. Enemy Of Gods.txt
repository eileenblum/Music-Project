Void of emptiness,
Within the universe,
The fearful offspring,
Son of Gaia,
Born from chaos,
100 viper heads,
Dripping sea of venom,
From evil eyes of fire

Hissing like 100 snakes,
Roaring like 100 lions,
Boiled lava pouring out,
Gaping mouths fire storms,
Rip up the mountains,
Throw them at the Gods,
Screaming the war cry,
World massacre,

Spawned:
Sphinx / Nemean - Lion / Cerberus / Ladon / Chimera / Hydra

Precious Echidna,
Head of a nymph,
Body of a serpent,
My hideous mate,
Annihilate the throne Olympus,
Sadistic carnage devastates,
Spitting forth terror,
The battle rages on,

Hardly a living creature,
Was left on Earth,
Typhon ripped up Mount Aetna,
To hurl at the Gods
