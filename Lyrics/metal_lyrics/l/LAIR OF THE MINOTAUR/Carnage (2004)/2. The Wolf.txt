Zeus walks the Earth as man,
To relate evil deeds,
Frightful with hiding beasts,
Lycaon tests deity,

Throne of the hostile king,
A shadowed offering,
Knife slits the servant child,
Served as a dish of flesh,

Avenging thunderbolts,
His wrath destroyed all men,
Punish deformity,
The wolf possessed Lycaon,

A lust for butchery,
Pleasure in the pools of blood
He howls at the night he bleeds,

Bring down society,
Slaughter eternity,
Defect obliterate,
Design a sect of hate

Bring forth the blood of nine,
Chanting unholy priests,
At Mount Lycaeus' peak,
Prepare cannibal feast,

Feel how I pierce your Earth,
Sacrifice mortal dirt,
Revel Arcadia now,
The oxen death will plow,

End time, Rise
New life, spine,
Evil curse, cries
You must die!

Blood of nine,
Sacrifice,
Feed the beast,
Human meat,

Cult of the wolf!
