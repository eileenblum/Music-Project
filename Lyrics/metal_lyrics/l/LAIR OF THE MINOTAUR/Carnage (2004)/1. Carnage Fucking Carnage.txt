I writhe in this coiled cage, the crooked labyrinth
My life has no escape, from this violence
Hybrid the mingled form, a monstrous shape
Beware all thee who dare, to enter this maze

7 sons and 7 maids, offered to the best
Skinned corpses lay in wait, for the demon's feast
We all had wandered here, hopelessly lost,
Lair of the Minotaur, you'll bare his cross,

I count the days as they pass
In convoluted flexion,
My eyes have seen, the end...

We all had wandered here, hopelessly lost,
Lair of the Minotaur, you'll bare his cross!
