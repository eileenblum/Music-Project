After Kronos dethroned his father,
By castration while he slept,
He threw his genitals,
Deep into the sea,
The twelve Titans ruled the heavens,
Ouranos told him of the prophecy,

You'll be overthrown,
By your own son,
He'll defeat you,
As you defeated me,

To thwart his impending doom,
All his children he would eat,

Because they're all immortal,
They remained alive,
Trapped inside his gut,
A prison for all five,

Rhea was enraged,
A mother with no child,
The sixth conception came,
She went to Crete to hide,

When Kronos came to Crete,
Making sure the child is dead,
She gave him a stone in cloths,
He swallowed that instead,

In a year the child matured,
He waged a war on his father,
The mighty Zeus prepared,
For the battle,
Of the Titans.

Warlord!

He forced Kronos,
To spit up his kin,
After his refusal,
Of restoring justice

So begins the Titanomachy,

The Gods fought from Mt. Olympus,
The Titans from Mt. Othrys,
After ten years of fighting,
The war hung balanced even

Gaia prophesized, victory for Zeus
If he aligned, fathers' prisoners,

3 Cyclopes and 3 Hecatoncheires,
He freed them from Tartarus,

The Cyclopes gave Zeus thunder,
And blessed him with fierce lightning,
Hecatoncheires' one hundred arms,
Hurling boulders at the Titans,

The sea rang up,
The heavens shook,
The earth crashed,
Olympus reeled

Flame rose up into the sky,
Thunderstone blinded eyes,
Titans fell at their feet,
See the end, Titanomachy

They were chained there,
In gloomy Tartarus,
Behind the bronze wall,
Pit of evil,
Beneath the Earth

Warlord!
