As I looked out,
I beheld a virgin chained to a rock,
Pale and motionless,
Except for flowing tears,
I asked her then,
"Why are you thus bound"?
Nymph plague, the seam onster,
Pride of beauty,
Human sacrifices

She shrieks out,
As the demon serpent approaches the coast,
I seize it by the neck and pierce between the scales,
Spouting from its nostrils,
Water mixed with blood,
Stab the open wound,
Final death stroke,
Dying by my hand
