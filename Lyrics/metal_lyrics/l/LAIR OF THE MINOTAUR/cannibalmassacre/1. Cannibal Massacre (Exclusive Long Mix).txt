We sailed on, though sick at heart 
Heavy rowing broke the slaves 
On the sixth day, the sun didn't rise 
As we headed from the east 
Then we came upon land of th Laistrygones 
Horrendous legendary fiends 

These residents, an old children's myth 
The flesh of human men they eat 

Bloodbath 
Skin reapers 
Slaughter 
Meat gatherers 
Cannibal 
Massacre!!! 

The harbors ingress, a narrow precipice 
All the boats steer themselves in 
I tied my ship to a rock beyond 
The entrance to this bordered niche 
Three scouts we're sent, on reconnaissance 
What abides beyond these cliffs? 
At Artakia's stream, they met a giant dame 
The daughter of King Antiphates 

The towering palace a lofty keep 
The gruesome queen stands fifty feet 
She called her king to greet his guests 
Ripped one in two and ate the rest 

The terrifying king cried out! 

Arise! Barbaric Laystrigones! 
Our meat has come to us. Tonight we gnaw on humans. 

Swarms of them came, lawless giant guild 
Hurling rocks from the cliffs 
A violent roar, from the din of streams 
Amid my fleet as men we're killed 
Spearing men like fish, to my astonishment 
Stacking bodies on a stick 
We sailed on, though sick at heart 
Barely thwarting perishment 

Bloodbath 
Skin reapers 
Slaughter 
Meat gatherers 
Cannibal 
Massacre!!!
