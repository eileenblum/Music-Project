Abnormal carnal desires,
Execute the priests bidding,
Offers the half-dead tissues,
And entrails yet are living,

Deadly teeth, of the beast, venom streams,
Pierce your flesh, at the strike, of midnight,

The spattered sword of fire,
Soaked with gouts of blood,
Black snakes swarmed the soil,
Fierce horns of Hecate entwined
