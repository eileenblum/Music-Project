We sailed on, though sick at heart
Heavy rowing broke the slaves
On the sixth day, the sun didn't rise
As we headed from the east
Then we came upon land of the Laistrygones
Horrendous legendary fiends

These residents, an old children's myth
The flesh of human men they eat

Bloodbath
Skin reapers
Slaughter
Meat gatherers
Cannibal
Massacre!!!

The harbors ingress, a narrow precipice
All the boats steer themselves in
I tied my ship to a rock beyond
The entrance to this bordered niche
Three scouts we're sent, on reconnaissance
What abides beyond these cliffs?
At Artakia's stream, they met a giant dame
The daughter of King Antiphates

The towering palace a lofty keep
The gruesome queen stands fifty feet
She called her king to greet his guests
Ripped one in two and ate the rest

The terrifying king cried out!

Arise! Barbaric Laystrigones!
Our meat has come to us. Tonight we gnaw on humans.

Swarms of them came, lawless giant guild
Hurling rocks from the cliffs
A violent roar, from the din of streams
Amid my fleet as men we're killed
Spearing men like fish, to my astonishment
Stacking bodies on a stick
We sailed on, though sick at heart
Barely thwarting perishment

Bloodbath
Skin reapers
Slaughter
Meat gatherers
Cannibal
Massacre!!!
