A yawning cave, dark and endless
Swelling barks of frenzied rage
Warder of the gates of Hades
Jailer of the dead

In the shadowed gulf of doom
Beware the cursed Cerberos
Dreaded hound who has no pity
Lies in wait and eats them up
Shakes the ends of the Earth
With barks from his three throats
Bristling snakes upon his necks
The blood of men enshrouds his coat

Lying in the darkened threshold
Reared up with all mouths wide
Scattering bones before him now
Ablaze his blood red eyes

Grisly death God
Hound of the pit
