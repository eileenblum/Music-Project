Altar of devouring fire,
Prepare the rites of Lethe,
Drench the ground below you now,
With the blood of sheep,

Accept these sacred rites tonight,
From your throne of pain,
I summon the ghost of doom,
Where the darkness reigns,

Behold, Magnanimous, The Ultimate Destroyer
Grant me, Avengement and Ghastly Death!!!

Beat upon the ground again,
Scream into my hands,
Call upon the God of Death,
Rise up from your black abyss,

Earth divides beneath my feet,
Smoke begins to swirl about,
Hear the howl of cursed men,
Demons all surround me now,

Behold, Magnanimous, The Ultimate Destroyer
Grant me, Avengement and Ghastly Death!!!

Master Hades, all pale and all enthroned,
Bequest upon, revenge to all my foes,
They shamed my home, during last winters hunt,
Murdered my son, and sliced up my wife s cunt...

I will live my days for you,
Servant at your feet,
Grant me retribution now,
Slay their precious families,

If thou ever wrought an archfiend,
Monsters fierce and foul of smell,
Bring some gruesome horror forth,
That the sky never beheld,

DESTROY! DESTROY! DESTROY!
