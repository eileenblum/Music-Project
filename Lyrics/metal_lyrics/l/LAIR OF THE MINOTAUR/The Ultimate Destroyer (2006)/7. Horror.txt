Relentless, the evil battle queen
Ghastly Eris all splattered with gore, so hideously
Sorrow, a desire for blood
Still lurking in the battlefield, wading in the suffering

HORROR!!!
THE HORROR!!!

Destruction, the giver of pain
Clay red, from the blood of the dead
Repulsion, the havoc of death
She stands on a corpse pile of a thousand men

HORROR!!!
THE HORROR!!!

Blasts of fire
Deadly sword
Tortured cry
Strife of war!

Infernal!
THE HORROR!!!
