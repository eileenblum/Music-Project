I
Stand on this hill
My will as law
For meat I kill

I
Hear demons sing
Bathe yourself in
Blood of the king

Forged metal, from fires of the hearth
Hades hammer, pounds the Earth
Keep my steel, at my side
And my enemies, skinned alive

I'll
Bash your brains out
Eat your entrails
Impale your torso

I'm
Abrupt of emotion
The Lord of thunder
Son of the ocean

I grip my sword
And advance upon the keep
Sneak upon the resting king
And spill his blood while he sleeps
Juggernaut!
Juggernaut of metal!!!
Juggernaut!
Juggernaut of metal!!!
