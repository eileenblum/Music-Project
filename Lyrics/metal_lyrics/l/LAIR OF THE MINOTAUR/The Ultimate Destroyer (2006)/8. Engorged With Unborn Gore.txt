Demonic spirit of Cybia
Majestic titan of the horrendous
Defiling cemeteries, haunting tombs
Eating corpses, leaving nothing but bones

Panic spreads as the stories divulge
Sadistic torture in which she indulged
Splitting open their pregnant wives
Devouring children that develop inside

Unleashed, killing brutishly
Soulless barbarian, winged depravity
Witchcraft lures men in her bed
Feel her last kiss as she removed your head

She has me down on my knees
This savage beast, vampyric queen

Bloodstained inhuman whore
Engorged with unborn gore!
