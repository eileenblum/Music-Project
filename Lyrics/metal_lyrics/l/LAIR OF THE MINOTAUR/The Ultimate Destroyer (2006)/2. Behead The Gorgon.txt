She was a beautiful maiden
Until she lay in the goddess shrine
Athens swore revenge on Medusa
With repugnant tusks of a swine

Locks of snakes drape over her head
Brazen hands and golden wings
Demoness of the grotesque

Into her grave, you feel it in your being, you slave
Eternal pain, your essence fades away, today!

War starved gorgons
Serving death to all
Perseus shall be slayer
Her head will fall...down

Laying waste to the countryside
No living thing can behold her stare
See your last breath in her eyes
Men of stone adorn her lair

BEHEAD THE GORGON!!!
