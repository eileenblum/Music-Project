From the southern seas
The dark army breeds
The snake skinned sons of Kourete's
An era has ceased
One hundred years of peace
Mankind now lusts for Hell's fury

Behold the sight
The violence iron age of man
I can't believe my eyes
The violent iron age of man

With avenging strife
Embitters human life
Masses of men now clash and fight
Skin red with blood
The countless dead
A warrior cries out in the night

Behold the sight
The violent iron age of man
I can't believe my eyes
The violent iron age of man

Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill
Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill Kill

Behold the sight
The violent iron age of man
I can't believe my eyes
The violent iron age of man
