Thunder rips the sky
Satyrs are circling
Cold heart - my doom is near
Punishment is certain

Madness - a frenzied cage
Smiting the serpents
Revealed my family
Dead in front of me

Storm of vengeance
Pale terror
Suicidal
Cannot escape this torment

Hunt and devour
Hunt and devour
Hunt and devour
Hunt and devour
