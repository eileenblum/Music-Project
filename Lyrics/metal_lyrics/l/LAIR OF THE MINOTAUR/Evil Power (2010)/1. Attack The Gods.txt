Let the Gods
Prepare for war
Rise giant violator
Lead the rage
Pathway to realms
From this hell I stab the stars
I stab the stars

Attack the Gods
For the blood of the innocent
Attack the Gods

Strip the skin
Armor worn
Maces crush their salty whores
Arrows fly
Bastard monarch's final call
His final call

Attack the Gods
For the blood of the innocent
Attack the Gods

Kill them all
God's domain
Raid with hell 'till all are slain
Heroes die
Olympus burns
The earth quakes as heaven falls
As heaven falls

Attack the Gods
For the blood of the innocent
Attack the Gods

Attack Attack

Attack the Gods
For the blood of the innocent
Attack the Gods

Attack Attack

Attack the Gods
For the blood of the innocent
Attack the Gods
