All our lives we've lived in shit
Fighting for our king
We have served his god
Slaying in his name
This is all we've known
Since we all were kids
We did what we were told
By the master's whip
Now I've tasted blood
And now I realize
The fear that's in their eyes
Is the same I had in mine

We fucked them all
Let's fuck them all again
Let's kill these motherfuckers
We fucked them all
Let's fuck them 'til they're dead
Let's kill these motherfuckers

If my father could see me now
With my heel in their skulls
This glorified revenge siege
And their temples all burning
Now I will take what's mine
The slave won't heed this time

We fought for this
I bled for this
Death strike. Take all of their lives
Mutilate and burn them alive
Make a pile and hack them with saws
Behead the mother while the children are mauled
Terminate the whole family tree
Impaled bodies all line the street
Rape and torch and cut and drink up
Penetrated by the sword of blood

We fucked them all
Let's fuck them all again
Let's kill these motherfuckers
We fucked them all
Let's fuck them 'til they're dead
Let's kill these motherfuckers
