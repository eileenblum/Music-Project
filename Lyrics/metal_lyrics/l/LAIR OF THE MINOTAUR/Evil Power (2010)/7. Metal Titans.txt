Echoing the laboured clang
Anvils made of bronze
Preparing metal for thunderbolts
Forging for the God's

Glowing steel and hissing fire
Hurled with mighty force
Heavy rocks this blackened craft
A hammer from the North

Masters of all weaponry
Instruments of death
Deep within volcanic caves
Made by iron men
Furnaces release the flames
The molten lava boils
Metal titans arm the men
That overthrow the world

For centuries
The armory for God's
