Cruel magician
Poison malicious
Darkest alchemy
Conjuring this hell

Come drink from the vein
Of the witch's rebellion
Desecrate the grave
Of the sorcerer's hellion

Flesh Carve Eat Brains
Blood from the witch's vein

The cult of Kirke
Drink at the altar
Vile incantations
Chanting in worship

Come drink from the vein
Of the witch's rebellion
Desecrate the grave
Of the sorcerer's hellion
Flesh Carve Eat Brains

All my life I've lived by the knife
I stood the test of time
I'm evil of the night
With power from the sky

Now you shall know who's wronged
Now you shall know who's wronged
Now you shall know who's wronged
Now you
