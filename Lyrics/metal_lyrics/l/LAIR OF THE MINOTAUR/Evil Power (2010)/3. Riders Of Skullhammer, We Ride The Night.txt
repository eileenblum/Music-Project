We ride tonight
We ride for Skullhammer

We ride to kill
We ride for Aitna's hill

Live to hurt the battle waged on
Phlegrae's plain the win God's son
With no remorse
On my immortal horse

The violent winds they're calling again

We ride the night
We ride the night
We ride the night
We ride

We ride the night
We ride to fuck you up
We ride to kill
We are insatiable
Broken bones weltering blood
Despise the idols all covered in cum
With blasphemies
We relish cruelty

The sign of the skull our flags are raised
The violent winds they call us again

We ride the night
We ride the night
We ride the night
We ride

We ride the night
We ride the night
We ride the night
We ride
