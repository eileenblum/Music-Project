We are violence
We are decay
We are a plague of death
We are the end of days

In the realm of Hades
The imminent menace of hell's lord
Look upon the sky
From the pools of the underworld
The throne is all devouring
Unchanged remains the infernal king
Hidden away in darkest depths
You will suffer eternally

Impiously I make vain prayers
For the death I leave behind
Where the darkness reigns
Your endless strength unlocked mankind
We defend this endless cave
Our dreaded army's void of light
Now the crimson seas aflame
Do thou summon sacrifice

You're knocking at the gates of Dis
You've entered our domain

We are We are
We are the dogs of war
Alright let's fight
Let's drink and kill tonight
We are a heartless horde
We are the black of night
We are a rotten curse
We are the sign of end of days

We are violence
We are decay
We are a plague of death
We are the end of days

We are We are
We are the dogs of war
Alright let's fight
Let's drink and kill tonight
We are a heartless horde
We are the black of night
We are a rotten curse
We are the sign of end of days

We are Hades
