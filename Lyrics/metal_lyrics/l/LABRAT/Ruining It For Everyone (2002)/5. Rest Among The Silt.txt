When it's dark and I'm alone I cry for peace but they won't go.
And this is killing me but I can never let you know
It's more than I can take, I sink - I drown - I cannot float
And they keep pushing me the rope constricts my fucking throat again...
You don't know what it's like if you did you'd never want me
To be there - And if I made you understand, you'd have
it an you'd BE IN THIS MESS!!!
Dragged down to rest among the silt, I cannot breathe it's ???

[The rest of the lyrics are too hard for me to interpret]
