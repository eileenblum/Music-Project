Question myself till I bleed
Will I live to spoil another day
The answers lost in mud
I won't if it goes on this way
And what if you discovered that
I could not give a fuck
Would you crumble, start to fall
Just like I have a hundred times before

Blacken my face
Distort my features
I'll be no-one soon

I was told to bank on 70
22's been hard enough
Search for a space to hide in
The life I have's too much
Feeble-minded, fickle and worthless
Sickened by my blind incompetence
Can't even pay the rent
And I can't see a way out

Blacken my face
Distort my features

alone - on my own - I fight but I will not win

I have been wrong - misled - and now I feel dead
Put in goal for the millionth time
Not a scratch on anyone else
Fuck you - can't even erase my self
I don't want to be here - living with fear
So whilst I hunt for the exit - keep the fuck out of my way
And you should know by now no one fucking hurts you like you hurt yourself

Submission hold around my throat
Father, son and holy goat
