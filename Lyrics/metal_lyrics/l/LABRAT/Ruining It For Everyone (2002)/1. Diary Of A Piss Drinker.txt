Left alone - with fingers bleeding
Try to claw - something worth keeping
On my knees - and bleeding
And you just don't give a fuck
A new betrayal - fucked hard again
Stripped to bone - by one more set of friends
Tear it down - no feelings of shame
Set up to be knocked down again

You have
No morals
Twisted
Selfishness
I hate you
Kill you if I
Wasn't gutless
Foul taste
Of piss
In my throat from you
And I invited you in
I fucking let you in

I stare into the mirror - clutching pride
Eyes tell the truth - I cannot hide
Another piece of me - has dropped and died
And now I lie here crippled by my life
Pride and sense of worth in a world of hurt
Are falling off me - and I can't get them back
Try to fight and love to hate - I build a wall
Against my will to protect from another attack

&gt;From the endless queues of bitter shits
Who wait in line with spikes and knives
With evidence and opinions of what I am
They don't know me and I do not even like them.......cunts
