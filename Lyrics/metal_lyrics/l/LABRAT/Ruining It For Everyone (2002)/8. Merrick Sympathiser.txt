It starts right now
Stake my claim for the throne of incompetence
Come last at everything - every time
I have failed at all I have attempted
Childhood goals tipped and up-ended

And you just look at me and say I fucking told you so
You're not the king of me I'm the king of me

So why do I still beg for your attention
My name remains a filthy word unfit for you to mention
I'm fucking shit, I'm really sick
I cannot cope, I don't think I can put up with it

Here we go again - headlong into another scene
I put hands over my eyes and try to hide
It never changes, I've never lived up to your expectations
I am the cancer in your life - I am a burden

And all the times I tried my best, it's never good enough
Cause every time I fail the tests - I'm just not good enough
Too fucking stupid, too fucking dull
I can never live up to what you want from me
I've only just begun to find my feet
And you kick them right out from under me

I can't compete, this isn't fair I'm the circle that cannot fit the square
Lying awake, cannot sleep
Play over in my mind all that you've done to me
I smile outside - inside I'm screaming
And silently - in my mind I'll always be your enemy I am your enemy
