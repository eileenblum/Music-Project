You cannot touch me
Will never feel me
I'll lock myself in a shell of shame
So you can never know me
Been bitten by your type before
Opened up and let you into me
Paint myself a new way just for you
Protect me
And I never begged
Never ever pleaded
Fought tooth and nail for
Anything I ever needed
Good morning, It's a new day
I think I'll just be on my own
This isolation makes me secure
Effect of words my major bone
Dishonesty from a mouth I once liked
Eyes wide a boy int??????
By this connection he may never have again

Gripped till he couldn't then he slipped
Friends are nice but few really care
Reflection all around me
I'm volatile
