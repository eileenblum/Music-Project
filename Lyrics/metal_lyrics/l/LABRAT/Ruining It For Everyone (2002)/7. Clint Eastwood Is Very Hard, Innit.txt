I am an asexual god
The self breeding mother of hate
Or maybe that's just how I feel

I reflect what I receive every day
In my world so full of lies
I reflect the pain I suffer every time
I spit out your filthy ugly name

It seems you radiate the sun
Inside you were hit with the ugly stick
I never ever felt more dead
Than when I got inside you

This extension of my hand
Will rid us all of shit like you
Could take your head clean off your neck
If I fucking wanted it too
Bad men will speak my name in fear
Cower back from Callaghan
Enforce the feelings I believe
Cos I'm the mother-fucking man

Cower back in fear.
