I'm dazed and contused alone now feeling confused one more time
I'm fucked up animosity has been struck up
You were supposed to be my friends this not so good thing how it ends
There is no way to make amends forced to my knees - I'm screaming

Beat down and raised up piss half fills the loving cup
Our bonding now breaking been giving - now I'm taking
Tried hard to be the best I could brought home with violence how good
Acting only as told I should again I'm down and bleeding this pattern 
repeats - spiralling around me
Spiralling round me - this pattern repeats.
Respect - no way man I'm bored it's out of hand
The time has come to close the door I just can't take this anymore
You're anal and you make me sick so get the fuck right off my dick
You filthy dirty lying whores I just can't take this any fucking more
I'm lonely and I've drawn a blank worked so hard with no thanks
Push through dirt to find the way out left alone in the house of doubt
The face that looks at me is dead killed by the bad things in my head
Push me again if you dare I'm past the point of pretending to care
I'm starting to wonder what friends are for.
