Down on your knees you cry for help
Unleashed the rage, no reprieve
What you've done is coming back around
Instant karma, appropriate I believe
Laugh out loud I beat you harder
Both hands broken you can't fight back
For years you tried to break me
Turned round no fists my odds are stacked
Strapped and abused in misery
Chewed up pissed on cast aside
No place for me in your plan for life
Learned through time to depend on you
And you ask me why I'm bitter
Placed you on a pedestal and fell
Outstayed my welcome once again
Your actions unacceptable
And you ask me why I'm bitter
Two's company, three's a crowd
Time for me, disallowed
Beaten fucked up it feels so sweet
Justice served for what you've done
Left now taped up in your defeat
Your time for repent is nigh, scum
And I see you smiling now
And you ask me why I'm bitter
You know I really used to like you don't you?
Consciousness slips away over time
You know I really used to like you.....
