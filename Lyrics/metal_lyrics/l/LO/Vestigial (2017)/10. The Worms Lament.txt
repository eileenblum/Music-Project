Our past forever clings
Fresh paint on old sins
We are damned men laughing
We are damned men laughing
Pack us well no room to fall
We stand in death erect loyal
Warmonger first world snake
Present false flesh to rake
So the worms cry out "inject us with fear"
So the worms cry out "hand me a gun"
Raise a glass
Stave off the horror
Flesh drum beats on
Gods of ruin
The grand deceiver spoke
"addicts for terror!"
The grand deceiver spoke
"sheep for heaven!"
Raise a glass

Our past forever clings
Fresh paint on old sins
We are damned men laughing
We are damned men laughing
Our past forever clings
Fresh paint on old sins
We are damned men laughing
We are damned men laughing
So the worms cry out "inject us with fear"
We the worms cry out "beat our flesh drums"
The grand deceiver spoke
"addicts for terror!"
The grand deceiver spoke
