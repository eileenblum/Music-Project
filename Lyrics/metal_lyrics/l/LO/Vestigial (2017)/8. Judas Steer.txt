To fillet through our hides to savour each of our crafted lies
You'd prefer to wield the blunt knife revel in this fear you smear
Inhuman nature
Melt you down to mend my rotten crown
Who's smiling now
Your veneer of god
Segregate us apes we
Ignore our DNA
Now clamber over our family skeletons
Hail the Judas steer
Hail our psychopomp
He'd love to lead us to the axe
Melt you down to mend my rotten crown
Who's smiling now
Your veneer of god
Spread my wings to flee your sufferings
Who's smiling now
Your veneer of god
We all shit seed choke
Snakes among us
You've always been here
You never loved us our Judas steer
We'd love you to lead us to the axe
We'd love you to lead us to the axe
