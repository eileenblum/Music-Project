Curse of technology
Ill lust of the west
A horde grown insensible
Life spent craning of necks
Such a wastage of flesh still glued to that screen
Our love now mechanized
Death of intimacy
Morons en masse
Granular identities
Our double edged sword
Plugged in humanity
Connected but empty
Hollow as prayer
False as a psalm
You're absent from your present
Fear of regrets addicted to staying abreast
Cyclops of distraction
Clutch the world in your hand
Cyclops of distraction
Glutton
Glutton
Maladaptive modern man
Whores for convenience
Slave to fashion
Maladaptive modern man
