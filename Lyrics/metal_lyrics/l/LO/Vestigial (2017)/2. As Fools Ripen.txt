Vestigial heart
Mongrel seed
Spectres of the soul
Neglected synthetic
Our puppet life
I can't deny
Squandering time
A shell forever
Your plague elect
All heavens sheep now shall receive
Their Judas goat I will deceive
All heavens sheep now shall receive
Their Judas goat I will deceive
Your usurper repent suffer
Cruelty personified
We nullify inside
Wade out in a silent sea of human grief
Come drown with me
Wade out in a silent sea of human grief
Come drown with me
Hollow as prayer
Empty as a psalm
Man's grotesquerie
Awe and abuse
Our ape deities
Cluster fucks
Hollow as prayer
Empty as a psalm
Snake amongst hens fools ripen
Blind vanity gluttons
I am the canker
The mouth of dirt
Carrion beggar
Your vile Christ
