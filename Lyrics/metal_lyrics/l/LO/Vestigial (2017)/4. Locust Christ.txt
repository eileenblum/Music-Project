We monkeys die a martyr's death
Via a million cuts
I call for regicide of our vulture Christ
Performing anti miracles
Sporadic whims
Tyrant democracy
Dethrone unrobe world breakers
Nailed to the beehive
Pray to the locust Christ
Emperor of demise
Skin slaves chained
To this ball of ash
Skin slaves chained
To this ball of ash
Marvel at our dying reef
Choke on this last gasp of hope
Decapitate our bloated priests
Ape blood debt
