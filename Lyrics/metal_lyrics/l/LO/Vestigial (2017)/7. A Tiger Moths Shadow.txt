Old vessels for the yard
Guilt ridden and battle scarred
Nostalgic impotence
As our own children stalk us
Masterless warriors
Senile with sheathed swords
Dull dreams all burnt out
Once were gods now slumber
Usurp life pathetic
Knell in your dying church
Of thriving lies accept it accept it
Usurp life pathetic
Kneel in your dying church
Of thriving lies accept it
Here's to your legacy
Judge me hung jury
Wardens to a sty
Dead birds fill a black sky
Usurp life pathetic
Kneel in your dying church
Of thriving lies accept it accept it
Usurp life pathetic
Kneel in your dying church
Of thriving lies accept it accept it
Here's to your legacy
Judge me hung jury
Wardens to a sty
Dead birds fill a black sky
The constant feast left you hollow
All hail your locust Christ
His age of sorrow
He's always been here our psychopomp
The Judas steer is one of us
Old vessels for the yard
Guilt ridden and battle scarred
Masterless warriors
Senile with sheathed swords
Dull dreams of past burnt out
Here's to your legacy
Judge me hung jury
Wardens to a sty
Dead birds fill a black sky
