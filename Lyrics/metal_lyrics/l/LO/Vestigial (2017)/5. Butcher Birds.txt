A tailored dread
Keeps insects at prayer
Dull witted worms captives of terror
This blind faith is indefensible
Meek is our herd
All the more malleable
Praise our western bliss
Raise our glutton kids
Kept in fear paralysis
Scapegoats and witch lists
Praise our western bliss
This horse with blinders on
Theatre of war
Butcher birds
Play out our gruesome acts
Mouth of coal
Skin of ash
Pretty as the crucifix
The banker's pawns
We bowerbirds
Use death to line our nests
Wings of lead souls of dirt
Pretty as the crucifix
Stripped naked exposed you'll be thankful
Home grown demon
Stripped naked exposed
Willingly we succumb shepherd us
Dull witted worms captives of a tailored dread
Bow down now stay mute and loyal
