Cloak our dying forms
In liars robes
Slither on life enders
Twisted will guilty smiles preaching peace
Elect the tainted
Pray to gods of ruin
Cashing in war lusting for death
Trusting in wolves
Gods of ruin
Gods of ruin fatal love of guns
Death immediate become a flood of bullets now
Gods of ruin fatal love of guns
Death immediate become a flood of bullets now
Worship opinion over facts
Primal rejection suit of false flesh
Bow to your death pope
Behold our locust Christ
Draw up extinction plans
Pontificate demise
Raise the runts worship mediocrity
Praise the stunts
Rejoice romance my rifle
Deep throat the cold barrel
