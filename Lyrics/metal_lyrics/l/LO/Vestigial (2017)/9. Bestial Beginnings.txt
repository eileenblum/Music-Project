A muse not worth truth
Kept in the cage of my chest
No respite in the flame
No warmth in the breath
This long age of life
Chains amass I suffer
This skin tarnished and worn
It's just more of the same
And we'll fester forever
The battered spouse and her vile Christ
Cake on the mask comply
The battered spouse and her vile Christ
