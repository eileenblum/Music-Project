Staring out beyond the shadows
To see a world of faces all the same
And find the light behind those darkened eyes
And realise the skies are more than grey

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Got the hunger but we're wanting more
Forever reaching higher
Remember what we're fighting for
The writing on the wall is

[CHORUS:]
Set In Stone
Set In Stone

Ghosts of the past now far behind me
Follow the path towards a brighter day
Now a fire lights inside those darkened eyes
Crucify the lies of yesterday

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS x 2]

[SOLO: LT / LT / MARK / LT / MARK]

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS 4x + AD LIBS]
