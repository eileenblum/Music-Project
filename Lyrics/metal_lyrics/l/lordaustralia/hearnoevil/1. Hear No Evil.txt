Watched the news today
Another preacher sinned
Yet all the while heâs praying for our souls
Heâll save us from the fire
Do as they say
âProtecting usâ, betraying trust
All lies
To help us sleep at night

[CHORUS:]
If we hear no evil, we will fear no evil
Close our eyes and turn away
If we speak no evil, we will seek no evil
Banish what we say
If we hear no evil, we will fear no evil
Close your mind â it goes away
If we see no evil, there can be no evil
No evil hereâ¦
Soliders killed today
A holy war or something more?
Agendas unknown â truth or lie?
A world away
Neglected cries, a child dies unseen
Never reach our TV screens

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO: LT / LT / MARK]

We look the other way
Oblivious in shrouded bliss
All doing what weâre told
Believing all we see
Behind the smiles
Pretty lies that open eyes can see
Wake up
Itâs down to you and me

[REPEAT CHORUS]
