I felt so weak, all hope was gone
My skin blistered slowly away
Gangrene and Smallpox - no life left inside of me
The pain that I felt was unreal...

[PRE-CHORUS:]
I make my last stand as success comes my way
My bones gain their strength, nothing stands in my way
The final encounter decides who will win
Desire to live will survive...

[CHORUS:]
Running away to paradise - victory in my sights
Running away to paradise - the gods are on my side

My body aching - scarred, torn and wretched
Forced to go on through the pain
Was it will that revived me, brought life back inside of me
With blood flowing fast though my veins...

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS and CHORUS]

[SOLO: MARK]

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x]

[SOLO: LT / MARK]
