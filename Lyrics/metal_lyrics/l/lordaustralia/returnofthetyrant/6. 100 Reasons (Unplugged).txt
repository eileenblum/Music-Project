The futureâs bright I tell you
Another perfect day
All our baggage packed we climb
Aboard this sinking ship
And so we sailâ¦

Takes a second to say hello
And forever to say goodbye
Turn the cheek of a blind denial
Into another lie

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Oh, playing out this masquerade
Hold on to the dream
How long can we travel down this road we made?
Go on alone and leave me far behind

[CHORUS:]
I tell myself weâre all okay
(I can) think of a hundred different reasons
For me to make you stay
I leave you now and go my way
To find a change of season
To help me get my feet back on the ground
Inside itâs so frustrating
A heart wrapped in golden chain
Always searching for the rainbow
Always waiting in the rain

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO: LT]

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS OUT]
