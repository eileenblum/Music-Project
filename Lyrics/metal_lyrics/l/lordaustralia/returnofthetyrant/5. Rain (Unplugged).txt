Darkness closes in
And I turn and face the storm
Midnight in the rain
Like a thousand times before

Oh... I feel the sorrow coming, world succumbing
Oh... I feel the sadness tear me away

[CHORUS:]
The rain keeps falling down on me
Of pain and life unwound to be
The rain keeps falling down on me
And darkness all around
As the rain falls down
Falls down on me...

A feeling of an empty life
Of broken heart, of broken dream
So tear the sonnet from my soul
Silent words unseen

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO: LT / MARK / LT]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
