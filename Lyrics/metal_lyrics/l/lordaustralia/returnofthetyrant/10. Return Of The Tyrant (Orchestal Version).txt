There was a ship.
Cursed, with black sails and crewed by the damned... or so the legend says.
Scores of souls were lost, sent down below to Davey Jones.
Then one day, it vanished... as if the ship was swallowed up by the sea itself.

It's said that on moonless nights the cursed ship returns to torment the waves,
With its crew of the damned and its captain with a heart of pure black.
Every sailor knows the legend and the name: Tarranno Del Mar... Tyrant Of The Sea.

Sailing through the gates of hell
Ten score years in wait, it served him well
Cast in shackles, a madman betrayed
Fed the anger that's burning inside of him
Broken chains, now he takes to the waves again
The tyrant's rage

Talons reach toward the sky
Pitch the banner black and raise it high
Cut-throat, insane, lost souls of the damned
Cursed eternal, the captain and crew with him
Rule the seas, the legend revived again
The tyrant's reign

[CHORUS:]
What secrets lie below the cold grey waters?
Moonless nights we rise
The tyrant rides again

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to turn
When the time has now come
The tyrant will rise again

[SOLO: LT / MARK / LT / MARK]

The seeds of death for all are sown
Dragged below the waves to Davey Jones
Torn asunder and plundered their gold
Shown no mercy, the Tyrant dispatches them
Trim the sails, new conquests await the rage
Of the Tyrant's blade

[REPEAT CHORUS]
