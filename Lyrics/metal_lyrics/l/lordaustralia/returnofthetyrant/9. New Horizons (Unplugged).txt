Another city passes in the darkness
Another country come and gone
And on this never ending road I wander
Seems like Iâm always on the run

[CHORUS 1:]
So long ago
I chose this lonely road
To follow new horizons
So far to roam
A million miles from home
So many more to goâ¦

In another life I could have been the everyman
Another tale untold for me
Cursed by the gypsyâs kiss and driven onward
To reap the winds, forever free

[CHORUS 2:]
So long ago
I chose this lonely road
To follow new horizons
So far to roam
But one thing I know
One day Iâll find that road
That takes me home

[Solo: LT / MARK]

Another plane, another train
Another thousand miles of road
And one more day, Iâll find my way
Home to youâ¦

Now I sit here waiting in the darkness
My thoughts a million miles away
Of all the things Iâve done, all the sights and wonder
Not one thing could make me stay (one more day)

[REPEAT CHORUS 2]

[SOLO: MARK]
