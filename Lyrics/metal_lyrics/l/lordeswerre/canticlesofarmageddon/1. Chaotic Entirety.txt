Dark overcasts swiftly engulf the light of the sun 
Power winds blow ragefully uplifting all in their path 
Roaring of thunder cracks across a blackened firmament 
The incoming damnation storm rips away at Earth 

Portals from holocaust realms form and open wide 
Impish invaders are permitted entrance at their will 
Ebony warriors of terror slay all as they ride forth 
Fiends of Chaos destroy with a bezerking fury 

Chaotic Entirety 

Canyons of beauty now become chasms of cessation 
Mists of gloom darken a once light filled skies 
Earthquakes rumble effectuating massive destruction 
Planes shift cracking as flames erupt from below 
Warcries are heard from amassed soldiers of hate 
Coffins open and crypted ones rise for vengeance 
Malevolent hordes are signed and storm the lands 
Suicidal demons sweep humanity into nullification 

Chaotic Entirety 

Civilization lies ruinic on pulverized hillsides 
Under vigil from beyond mankind weeps it's losses 
Sorrow overcomes hope as an uncureable disease infecting 

Levin out of above agrades the planet's weakened crust 
Vicars of darkness laugh at the third from sun's demise 
The pious light dissolves as if never there
