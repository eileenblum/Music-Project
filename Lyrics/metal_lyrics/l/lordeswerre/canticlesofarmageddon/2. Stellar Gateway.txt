Out of eternity, they triumphantly voyage 
From galaxy to galaxy domineering 
New races to enslave, new worlds to burn 
Expanding their dark dimension forever 

Technology supreme, used to conquer 
Weaponry beyond light-years of study 
Bombarding planets, extinguish novas 
Pirating crucial resources, leaving only desolation 

The armada lies in formation 
Ready for entrance to new systems 
Their leader opens the Stargate! 

The solar system appears through the gateway 
Scanners detect life only on the third 
Mankind knows nothing of the nightmare to come 
Armageddon of Earth will soon arrive 

Creatures all beg for salvation 
Horrors of a world being murdered 
Gazing into skies filled with destruction 
Dying at the hands of an unknown force 

Allegiance sworn by oath 
His dark army pulverized the universe 
Access through the Stargate! 

Fragments of worlds float through space 
Stars power drained and fade away 
Creations finale, demise of the cosmos 
All because of one being's greed 

Somber reign over the galaxy 
Slaves, riches, resources 
Brought to him through the Stargate! 

Darkness envelops the universe!
