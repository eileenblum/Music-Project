Herot Hall, that cursed music and happiness 
Shall forever by his fiendish oath be dissolved 

Who's domain is deep in the haunted moors 
At the base of a murky serpent filled lagoon 
Who's devoted to always break God's law 
Feasting Hrothgar's helpless dormant subjects 

As daylight fades, arising from obscure slumber 
Trampling out of the misty hills and marshes 

Conceived of She-wolf, spawned in foul slime 
His eyes glow angrily bright through darkness 
Making repasts of Hero's warriors who sleep 
Tyranny of this hall is now totally achieved 

Bloodlust drives his only motive, evil wrath 
Glorification and nourishment lie in his slaughters 

No blade can harm this unholy flesh 
Enlongened claws with such razor precision 
Jaws of strength with no mortal contention 
Soul and mind always in a constant rage 

Sworn to a creed of eternal sin and greed 
The shepard of evil and the guardian of crime 

As dark as the air, as black as the rain 
That the Heaven's weep 
Grendel !
