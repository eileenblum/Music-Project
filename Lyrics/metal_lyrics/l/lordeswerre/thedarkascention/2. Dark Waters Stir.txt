Past the shadowed planes 
Invisible during Daystar 
Body of all Impiety 

Through tenebrous dismal fogs 
Between the distant shrines 
Lays the iniquitant pool 
Nourishing the haunted woodlands 

Three rivers lead to this 
Black ocean of the night 
Dark shining surging sea 
Seen only in moonlight 

Black cities submerged by time 
Tombs of ancient gods 
The dark waters stir 

Cyclone above the spume 
Dropping souls in the waves 
Undercurrent pulling them in 
Vampirism robs the essence 

Spectres and ghouls above 
Serpents unseen lurk below 
Ghostly ships on the surface 
All phantoms of these phathoms 

Rancid breath-taking stench 
Sea of the black earth 
The dark waters stir 

Ghastly screams, eerie voices 
Creatures beneath the billows 
Horrid faces of death 
Anxiously waiting in time 

Absu lies, Cthulu sleeps 
Lords of these depths 
Plumed one of the gate 
Awaits on the unseen shore 

Here is where the dead swim 
Lagoon of the obscure 
The dark water stir 

The waters retain all evil
