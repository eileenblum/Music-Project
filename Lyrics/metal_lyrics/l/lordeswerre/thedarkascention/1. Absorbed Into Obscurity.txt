Darkened image rests before me 
In the third dimensional form 
Echoing languages sear through 
Within my mind they swarm 

Enslaved by these caverns 
An endless maze made of ice 
The ultimate trial of my soul 
Awaiting to be shown a sign 

Plummeting through the whirlwinds 
Deities spin upwards from bodies that have died 
Mountains crumble and fall to the sea 
As fire fills the skies 

Falling into an unknown dimension 
Landing in waters that have no shores 
Creatures fully new to knowledge 
Cannot interpret their chants and roars 

Search to find second entrance 
Upon the wings of impiety 
Ascent from accursed mortality 
Only ashes remain of first vitality 

None shall forbid further introspection!
