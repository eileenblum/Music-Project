[lyrics by Devasth]

Infested land of pure blood
The true spirit being lost
The ancients are calling
Ally, the dark hordes

Hordes -- united by blood
Dark -- my faith is sealed

I see our union
Destroyed by those
False to their beliefs
And full of envy

I see our union
Rotten and fake
The true must unite
To inflict... pain

[repeat 2nd &amp; 3rd verses]

I see our union
Rotten and fake
The true must unite
To inflict... death

I slay the impure human
The scourge of mankind
I shall have my glory
The glory lost for so long

The calling, the unborn spirit
Rebirth, the spirit of our fathers
Unite. our lands are screaming
True dark hordes'... alliance!

[repeat 6th, 7th, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 2nd, 3rd &amp; 5th verses]
