[lyrics by Devasth]

Nebelwerfer 666
Six barrels of pain
Nebelwerfer 666
Armour destroyed

Nebelwerfer 666
Insane destruction
Nebelwerfer 666
Worshipers of war

Infernal, demonic onslaught
Devastation is the cause
Hell, is what you'll feel
Burn the weaks' strength

Erased...

Fire -- division
Hell -- pain
I stand on the battlefield
Unleashing my wrath!

Evil curtain of smoke
Evil fire through the air
Destroying all on its way
Satanic embodiment of... hate

[repeat 1st verse]

Nebelwerfer 666
Insane destruction
Nebelwerfer 666
Worshipers of death

Six mighty barrels of pain
Saturated targets explode
Devastation 1941
Red army turned to dust

Destroyed...

[repeat 4th &amp; 5th verses]

We are worshipers of war!
