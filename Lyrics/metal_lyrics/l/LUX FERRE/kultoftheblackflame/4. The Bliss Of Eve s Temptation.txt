[lyrics by Baal Sabbath]

Death invoker, necromaster
Stir up the dead into life
Raise the infernal army again
The final battle is at hand

Satan, impious commander
Father of the damned legion
Lucifer, king for all conquering
Rebel, master of the fallen

Attack with no mercy
Thy kingdom come
Announcing the death of god
And the rape of Jesus Christ

Cold is my hate
Feel it on thy skin
Meet me at the end of the world

Death be my name
For everything i slay
Nothing can stop the holocaust

When the sky bleeds
The altar of ruin it will be complete
Defining the ways
To launch the apocalypse

Corpses lying
Mankind murdered
The purest terror in its grandeur

Godless world
Return to desolation
Into darkness and fire it turns

The morning star hails a new dawn
The vacuum kingdom, world of nothingness
Our ancient desire, our strongest addiction
The bliss of eve's temptation

A dead Christ cannot save this world
We rule over ourselves
His dismal father i mock of his words
See thy flock forever burned
