Water of wine, blood in my veins.
Cold as my spirit... It doesn't boil, it doesn't drain!

I need the feeling of loss, my thirst for loss.
Obtained pain through death. Cursed for all eternity.
With pleasure...

At last I cry but yet my thirst doesn't fade away.
My tears are of cold blood such as my heart is ice.
It doesn't drain, it doesn't melt, it doesn't boil!

My sadness is enough. I'll find and steal from others.
Those that I've once loved, the ones I murdered...
Because my veins are roots. Dead and forgotten roots
That once bred hope.
