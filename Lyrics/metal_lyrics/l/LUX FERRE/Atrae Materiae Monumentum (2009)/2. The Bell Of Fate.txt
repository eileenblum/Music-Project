Something tells me to die, it runs through my body.
My flesh asks for pain. My mind asks for suffering.
Its sound that only I can listen, it pierces my brain.
Separates my mind from my body, it pierces the I in me.

My body is dead, yet moving. It feels neither pain nor hunger.
My mind is enlightened, linked to the world of wisdom.

Possessed by darkness, my blood is pain.
I breathe the stench of hate.
My mind is perfection, linked to the supreme freedom.

Despising the forgotten,
Erasing the inner pain.
Commanded by the bell...
My bell of fate.

Feasting in blood and death my eyes are red,
I fear only myself celebrating disgrace...
Feasting in tears and pain my eyes are dead,
I fear only myself celebrating your demise.
