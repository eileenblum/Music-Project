[lyrics by Baal Sabbath]

Celebrate the War
Darkness day, give praise
Hell rises to the earth
Satan rejoices the throne

Fire burns the world
Light the sky from under
Laws crawling to us
Anarchy will prevail
Our strength grows strong

Year of the Beast
Horns' crush in celebration
It's time to Sin
666 - No salvation
All blood drains through
Holocaust

through the hands of god
The hands of christ wounded by us
Celebrate his pain
Our kingdom will come to incinerate

Now we reign
Destroy by Fire
Obliterate

Reduce to nothing
The inferior faith
In mayhem congregate
In havoc... celebrate

Celebrate the war
Darkness day, give praise
Hell rises to the earth
Satan rejoices the throne

Fire burns the world
Light the sky from under
Laws crawling to us
Anarchy will prevail
The War goes on
