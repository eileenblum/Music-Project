[lyrics by Devasth]

I end my life with pride
The ultimate fulfillment

My acts now have a goal
Servitude for Thy will

The power to corrode purity
Feeble essence to terminate
Slow Death for Satan
Corrosion &amp; Decay

Trapped inside your body
You cannot sustain
The pain that I give you
You should be grateful

Now you know what Death is
The power of suffering
Now you cry for more
Am I right? Now you fall...

Corrode, for the glory of Hell
Found the Pain in life
Corrode, I shall put you in Torment
Designed to all mankind...
