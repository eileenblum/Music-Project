[lyrics by Devasth]

I embrace the fear
Entering the other side
You never dreamt this
The complete essence of my kind

Chaotic, eternal vacuum
I travel between the lines
Traveling in unseen darkness
And Death is my weapon

Darkness absorbing my life
Delivered essence to Satan
Summoned to embrace Death
Sacrifice for eternal suffering

Infinite Death through pain
My body set to flames
Flames of rotten weak flesh
I scream with great pleasure!

Invaded lifeless body
Tyranny rules your will
The life shall never be returned
Cry in Agony!
