[lyrics by Devasth]

Time of words
Worthless blasphemies
Heretic nonsense
Of weak minds

Time for Destruction
The useful Pain
Effective disgrace
Burning calamity

Subversive acts
No Blood in vain
Christian waste
By Satanic will

Denial's end, ways to destroy
Denial's end, the end of the weak

Destroy, Subvert
I am the Action of Thy Word

The Word of Satan
Is already done
His orders of Pain
His loyal Son
