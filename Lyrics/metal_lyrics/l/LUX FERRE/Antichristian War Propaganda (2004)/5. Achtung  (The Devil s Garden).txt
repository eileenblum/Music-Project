[lyrics by Baal Sabbath]

This is my Kingdom, a Realm of Fire
Where angels don't dare, Evil Empire
Dark soil, haunted by silent castles
Entombed by the might of a doctrine

Camouflaged is the path to Victory
The dream of every mortal soul
When confronted to the desolation
Of thorns arising with no warning

Set, is the scenery, in the battlefield
Armored dust, against religion
Detuned just with the stench of god
Spreading Lucifer's Wings...

In a mortal embrace
The doctrine of generals
This is the Devil's garden

Thrash the lamb of god
And rip all of his flock
Satan laughs as christ leads the world
To the garden of WAR

Tactics in Warfare is a Black Art
The symbols we dominate, I invoke Tiamat
Death assault to the enemy
From the underground a storm breeds

Set the hostility with no alert
Heavy artillery stays firm in the dirt
Fire at will when christ's in sight
Spread your wing's Master

In a mortal embrace
The doctrine of generals
This is your garden made for fools
The third ghoul is a Legion

The Devils garden...
This is the Devil's garden...
