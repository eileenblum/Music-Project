[Lyrics: Jamin - Music: Buriez]

You preachers of death
Thank for your doctrines of good and evil
You appraisers and judges
Use violence you, arrogant wise man

You know that everything that is living is something obedient, you
You know that we command the one who canât defend himself
You know so well that the one

Who obeys himself
Judge is, avenger, victim of his law

Subject to spirit
Where life is, thereâs a will
But not a will to live, a will to gain power
Decline is when life gives in to power

But a bigger strength grows from your morals
The creator who spawns good and evil
Will break the mirror and its reflection
Life is what has to master itself

So supreme evil
Belongs to supreme goodness, this one is subject

Subject to spirit
Where life is, thereâs a will
But not a will to live, a will to gain power
Decline is when life gives in to power

Where life is, thereâs a will
But not a will to live, a will to gain power
Decline is when life gives in to power

But you creator, do you know ?
Do you know that whatever you create
And whatever you love, you love it ?
Do you know that you will have to fight your creation, your love ?

But you creator, whatâs your will ?
But you creator, whatâs your goal ?

But you creator, whatâs your will ?
But you, whatâs your goal ?

Your crusade for power, for reigning control
Is subject to spirit like an image and its mirror

An image, and its mirror, its mirror

But you creator, do you know ?
Do you know that whatever you create
And whatever you love, you love it ?
Do you know that you will have to fight your creation, your love ?
