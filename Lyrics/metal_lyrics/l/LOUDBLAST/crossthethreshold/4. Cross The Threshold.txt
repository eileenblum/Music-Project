I am, mother nature made me with flesh and blood 
I am, mother nature gave me a sex 
I am an animal, and my instinct wants me to copulate 
I am a man, and my instinct wants me to enjoy sex 

[Refrain:] 
See the beast, choose the truth 
Cross the threshold, open the door to orgasm 
See the beast, choose the truth, follow your instinct 
Cross the threshold, be an animal again 
See the beast, choose the truth 
Cross the threshold, follow your instinct, become an animal again 

I want you to be my enjoyment 
I want you to forget your soul 
I want you to remember your body 
I want you to forget all that you've been taught

[Refrain]

I am a man, and I want to enjoy sex 
No, I am an animal 
Join me in the realm of true feelings 
Join us and find our deepest sex drives 

See the beast, choose the truth, follow your instinct 
Cross the threshold, open the door to orgasm 
See the beast, choose the truth 
Cross the threshold, follow your instinct, become an animal again [x2]
