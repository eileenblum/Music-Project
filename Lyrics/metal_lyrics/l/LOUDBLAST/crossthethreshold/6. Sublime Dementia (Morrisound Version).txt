[Music &amp; Lyrics: Loudblast]

A still and peaceful bliss, a glorious resignation, any contradiction fades away
Any philosophical problem becomes clear, or so it seems
For a long time you havenât been in control but youâre not afflicted by it anymore
Mind absorbed in meditation of an ideal virtue, an ideal charity and ideal genius

You naively abandon yourself to your triumphant spiritual orgy
When will we seek happiness ?

Hoarse and deep sighs leave your chest as though your former body couldnât stand
The desires and the quickness of your new soul
A miasma mischievously clouds your brain , soon you will laugh at your madness
But you cannot dismiss it, for you will, for you will

Has no more strength and cannot rule your faculties anymore
When will we seek happiness ?

Appalling marriage of a man to himself
Because proportions of time and being are completely upset
By multitude and intensity of feelings and ideas
Appalling marriage of a man to himself

Sublime dementia, sublime dementia
Sublime dementia

A humanâs fanatic lust for any substance
Which exalts his personality proves his magnitude

He always aims at exciting his expectations
And at rising to the infinite

Appalling marriage of a man to himself
Because proportions of time and being are completely upset
By multitude and intensity of feelings and ideas
Appalling marriage of a man to himself

Sublime dementia
