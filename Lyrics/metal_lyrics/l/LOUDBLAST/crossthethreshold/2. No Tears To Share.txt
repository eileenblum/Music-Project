Set back, blinded by my illusions, contagion 
My seed is illusion, the balance seems to stay motionless and wicked 

My tentacles are growing to hug you better 
My roots are rotting to soil you better 
My tentacles are growing to hug you better 
My roots are rotting to soil you better 

I will have sway over you, so stronger and faster you will be 
Among soiling people, soiled, motionless and soiled... 

My tentacles are growing to hug you better 
My roots are rotting to soil you better 
My tentacles are growing to hug you better 
My roots are rotting to soil you better 

Desire, my sex is mastering you, 
Ecstasy as an artificial paradise 
Silence, I can share my silence 
Communion, but my silence is without a smile 

No tears to share, nothing to share 

Silence, I can share my silence 
Communion, but my silence is without a smile 

From that time fed with my sediments stagnating in a cesspool 
You will forever be motionless 
Too late to creep to the end of the tunnel, too late ! 

(My tentacles are growing to hug you better 
My roots are rotting to soil you better) 

Desire, ... 
No tears to share, nothing to share
