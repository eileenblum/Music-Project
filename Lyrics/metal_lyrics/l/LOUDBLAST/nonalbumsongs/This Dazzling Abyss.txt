[Live Track]Yeah. Sensuality on alert
Our appetite for sex is stronger than ever forgotten
In sexual delight
Hungry for you more than ever
Join me into the heat of penetration
Let's go out of time
Let's go out of space more than any drugs, sex is the ultimate one
As sweet as a promise, as hard as a lie
Let go everything that's deep inside you
Throw ourselves into this dazzling abyss
To feel the thrill of the highest degree
Let go that's deep inside me
Throw ourselves into this dazzling abyss
Let's go out of time.
In this new dimension we are now wizards we'll never be afraid again, never again
Old age and death can't reach us
During this paroxysm of senses This paroxysm in madness
Let go everything that's deep inside you
Throw ourselves into this dazzling abyss
To feel the thrill of the highest degree
Let go that's deep inside me
Throw ourselves into this dazzling abyss
