Crushing skulls
Mutilated limbs
I delight in tormenting
Bloody vomit
Rottening guts
Repulsion is my kingdom
Screams Of horror
Final agony
Face the ultimate pain
Cut throats
Horrific sight
I stab you to death

Slaughtering
Blowing
Ripping
Mangling

Nasty desire
Agony
Macabre pleasure 
Agony
Dreadful night 
Agony
Helpless with fear

Corpse in decay
Flesh tears to pieces
Flee my sadistic brain
Pools of blood
Lacerated defuncts
Enter the human slaughterhouse
Infested bowels
Contorted bodies
Torture has no boundaries
Stench of the carrion
Decomposed victims
You die in pain

Slaughtering
Blowing
Ripping
Mangling

Nasty desire
Agony
Macabre pleasure 
Agony
Dreadful night 
Agony
Helpless with fear

I break you into bits
It's time to know the agony
I deliver you from life
Rejoin the necropolis

Agony
