You all know what I look like
You think to know all about me
You find I'm repulsive
You don't understand the word pity
I'm just your whipping boy
For the jokes I'm your guy
But beware of your mind
Today it could twist

Dream to nightmare
I can give it to you
The power I possess
Nobody can't escape
Life to corpse
I just curse you
My brain's on fire
I decide of your fate

My eyes peer and destroy
My will is done
My hatred is stronger than the horror
Which is burning inside you
No forgiveness only revenge
The wickedness of my mind scorns you
Now you implore me to save your life
For me it's already gone

You hear the horrid screams
Coming from everywhere and nowhere
You see destruction and fear
But it's too late for coming back
Your hands beg for mercy
Insanity is near
I can see your eyes crying
Now you give up the ghost

Dream to nightmare
I have given it to you
The power I possess
Nobody had escaped
Life to corpse
You've just felt my wrath
My brain's on fire
I decide of your fate

My eyes peer and destroy
My will is done
My hatred is stronger than the horror
Which is burning inside you

No forgiveness only revenge
The wickedness of my mind scorns you
Now you implore me to save your life
For me it's already gone

The horrible sight of pain
Can't cure my twisted mind
I wanna hear your muffled howl
Your fear is my only pleasure

The day for the burial is coming 
But I will not go into mourning 
I see your corpse put on a hearse 
While the bells toll the knell
