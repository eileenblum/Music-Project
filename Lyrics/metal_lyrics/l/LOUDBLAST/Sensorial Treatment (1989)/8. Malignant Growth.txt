Hurled by the road of your life 
Your stomach burned at the stake 
You tried to escape 
You thought succeeded in 
But you flew too high 
The bound, the energy 
You gave to yourself 
Turned against you 

Seeing the white infinite 
Discovering the living beauty 
And going to the excruciating 
Annihilation
Flying away and hoping 
Sinking and bursting 
Malignant growth 
Malignant growth 

Attraction of the void 
Your fall begun
Weeker arriving in the absolute 
A caughting black hole 
Before your eyes 
Deep into the point of no return 
This force making yourself dreaming 
Now rambling 
Got the better of your will 
The others: stupid mankind didn't understand
But are their lives worth yours? 

Seeing the white infinite 
Discovering the living beauty 
And going to the excruciating 
Annihilation
Flying away and hoping 
Sinking and bursting 
Malignant growth
Malignant growth 

Seeing the white infinite 
Discovering the living beauty 
And going to the excruciating 
Annihilation
Flying away and hoping 
Sinking and bursting 
Malignant growth 
Malignant growth
