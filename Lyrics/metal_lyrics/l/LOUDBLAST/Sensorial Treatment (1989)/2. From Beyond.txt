My blood curdles in my frozen veins
My corpse enters the coffin
They all cry before my lifeless body
But my spirit lives again and goes far

Walking along empty corridors
To the gates of death
I'm seeking for an open door
Which could take me to my destiny
I'm staring at a light
Shining bright in the darkness
Attracted by an unknown force
I no longer control my will

Open the gates 
See beyond this dark mist 
There's something 
You don't have to miss
Turn the key
Don t you know beyond this frontier
Is the beginning of another life

Behind the dark mist
Your soul could find the peace
Behind the dark mist
Your torments could also begin

I turn the key of my future
Suddenly nothing before me
I'm in the abyss of time
Awake from my nightmare
Now I try to move
Frightened I realize
I'm buried and forgotten

I'm seeking for a gleam
Which can set my mind at ease
The key of my fate
The only which can save myself
The door of my vault
Is walling up for ever
I cry all alone
In my eternal jail

Open the gates
See beyond this dark mist
There's something

You don't have to miss 
Turn the key
Don't you know beyond this frontier
Is the beginning of another life

Behind the dark mist
Your soul could find the peace
Behind the dark mist
Your torments could also begin

Trapped beneath the surface 
I howl my fear 
I cry my death
Condemned to know the worse sufferings
My body is emptying gradually
Of its life
I'm short of air
Madness is overcoming myself
My limbs are paralysing 
I'm departing this life 
Without noise
Now I can search for the door

I fought for my fate
But I lost this deadly game
I don't want to die
Too late
