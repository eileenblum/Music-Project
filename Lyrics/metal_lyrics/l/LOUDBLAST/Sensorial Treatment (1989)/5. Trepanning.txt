Trepanning

Corroding your freedom
Narrowing the mind
Expression of pure hate
Intolerance in all its ugliness
It's probably tried to enter you

Human feelings are so strange
Mankind is sometimes so stupid
Pushing away what people call love
To the last wall of hate

Jealousy is as frightful as murder
Flee Its company
And you'll find felicity
Succeed In life, you trigger envy off
You'll intersect its path again

Put your trust in someone
Your disappointment
Will be bigger than ever
Only waiting for the mistake
Which will drag you down
She'll took your place
The vicious circle continues
