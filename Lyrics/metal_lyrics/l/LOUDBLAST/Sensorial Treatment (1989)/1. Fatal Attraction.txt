When I met you, it was so easy
Pleasures in a high conventional way
So much climax I felt
When you taught me pain
A feeling of never going too far
Caught in an iron collar
Never thinking of scattering from it
Beware of the following step

Mistake, you don't even think of it
Orgasm is your only goal
Mistake, your limits aren't the same
Will you find your way?

Fatal attraction
Beginning of your sensorial treatment
Fatal attraction
End of your basic freedoms

Her madness is growing
Like a disease
The boundaries of pain.
And torture are so near
Escape from this craziness
You guess you can follow
The roads to self-destruction

A feeling of being gone too far
Caught in your own trap
You can't even get away from it
The final step is reached

Mistake, you don't even think of it
Orgasm is your only goal
Mistake, your limits aren't the same
Will you find your way?

Fatal attraction
Beginning of your sensorial treatment
Fatal attraction
End of your basic freedoms
