Back from the infinite past 
What's the real climax, now I know 
Pleasure and pain being integral part
In my indescribable travel

Through mourning cries laughin' and lust
Fire lands of desolation
I must do penance
Through ages I'll wander

Infinite pleasures
Infinite pleasures

Master of senses' disciple
Initialed to something
Which became vital for me
I must break the pact I passed
Before I'm nothing

Through mourning cries laughin' and lust
Fire lands of desolation
I must do penance
Through ages I'll wander

Infinite pleasures
Infinite pleasures

No way to escape their wrath 
I lost my human form 
An entity now I am 
I had to reborn 
To convey their secret 
I'm searching for trie vital fluid which could reanimate me 

My tortured body is bleeding from pleasure 
Time will arrive
When I pass on the keys of senses 
I'm waiting for that time to come
