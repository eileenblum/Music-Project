Know that it begins 
In world of mystery
In worlds of terrors and perditions 
And that is comes among pale visions 
Of the precipice where are larvae 
And crimes
Where the creation scaring abysses 
Prolongs itself in a shadow 
In a ghost
The evil, through the flesh 
Enslaves you 
Disgorges a huge steam 
Who lives

I have before my eyes 
The dreadful darkness 
The chasm is here 
Dismal and vast

I feel alone in the endless silence 
To cross this deep gulf 
Without edge
An angel shows me the crypts
Where God or the beast
Awaits me

Visions of the end
Show us your fate

There are sinks
In floods of disaster
The hydra Universe
Twisting its body
There are all floats
And goes away in a dark wreck
In this abyss without edge
Without wall
And we see in the depth 
When the eye dares go down in 
Beyond life, blast and noise 
A frightful dark sun 
From which come 
Radiations of the night 

I have before my eyes 
The dreadful darkness The chasm is here 
Dismal and vast

I feel alone in the endless silence 
To cross this deep gulf 
Without edge
An angel shows me the crypts
Where God or the beast
Awaits me

Visions of the end
Shows us your fate

I feel alone in the endless silence 
To cross this deep gutf 
Without edge
An angel shows me the crypts 
Where God or the beast 
Awaits me 

Visions of the end 
Show us your fate
