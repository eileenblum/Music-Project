You, liar
Begging mercy for your sins
You lead my fury
I'll watch you down on your knees

You closed your ears,
I'll lock your eyes.
I don't care for you tears
Now you're living in fear
The end of your story is near

I'll watch you down on your knees
Crying for absolution
I'll watch you down on your knees
Praying for redemption

You betrayer
You feel sorry, you're so weak
I destroyer
I feel sorry for you...cunt!

A burn for a burn
A wound for a wound
A bruise for a bruise
A life for a life

Get down on your fucking knees before your master
I only feel disgust for your thrust
Get down on your fucking knees before your master
Taste the bitter seed, which is gonna poison your filthy blood

You, liar
Begging mercy for your sins
You lead my fury
I'll watch you down on your knees

You betrayer
You feel sorry,you are so weak
I destroyer
I feel sorry for you...cunt !

A burn for a burn
A wound for a wound
A bruise for a bruise
A life for a life
