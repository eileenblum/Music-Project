The labyrinthe innermost 
Recess of time 
Throws up a deep...red...foam 
Which mingles with the millenial backwash 
Of a deserted beach 
In the deepest depht of a frozen winter 

And the horizon becomes inflamed 
And the whole earth starts a rough symphony 
By the sound of the roaring water 
The whole earth starts a rough symphony
