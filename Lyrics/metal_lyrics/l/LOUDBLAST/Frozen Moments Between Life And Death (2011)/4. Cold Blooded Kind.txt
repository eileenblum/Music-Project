Stronger even if I lay on my back 
I'm me 
Alone 
Let the bells ring the same tune 
My blood remains cold 
My heart will stay cold 
My heart remains cold 
Drink my wine and blur your mind 
My blood remains cold 
Melt with my blood 
My heart remains cold 

The wine of disaster is served to be drunk 
I'm stronger 
I'm me 

The wine of disaster is served to be drunk [3x]
