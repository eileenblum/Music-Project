So many ways to face the void 
Flesh, wisdom, beliefs, fight 
So many ways to face the void 
All I know is I can't close my eyes 

Emptiness crushes my soul 

Values and feelings are lies 
The saint just can only sin 
The faithful always betrays 
And the priest invokes illusions 

Emptiness crushes my soul 

I wish I was never born 
To feel the violence of truth 
Nothing is everything 
Everything is nothing 
Oblivion could set me free
