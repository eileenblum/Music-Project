Get ready to bite, to spit, to yell 
With scorn and bile, tear out the veil 
Galvanised, rushing through your veins 
Radiant energy roaring for pains 
Feel the boiling blood [3x] 

Feel, and fell again 
The eternity of the instant 
Feel the blast 
Fuel the fire 
Embrace the pyre 

So suffer and suffer more 
Rage and blast, once again and forevermore: 
Only violence transforms us deep! 
Only pain sharpens our teeth! 

We suffer and suffer forevermore 
Rage and blast 
Cuz in the end 
We get it all [2x]
