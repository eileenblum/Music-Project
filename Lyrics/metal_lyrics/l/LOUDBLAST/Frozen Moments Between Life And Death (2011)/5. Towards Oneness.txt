As the bleeding red sun 
Burns the mortal's souls 
Glows through your veins 
Heats your drying soil 
The undying forces of light 
Shall wash your sins away 

Towards oneness [2x] 

Accept the age of dissidence 
Embark on the journey 
You don't wanna see 
Forget your old dissonance 
Set your soul free 
In the hands of another deity 
In the crux of humanity
