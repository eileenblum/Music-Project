Only tortures around you, only wounds
No friends, no aid... alone to defend
Torrid winds assault, dirty blast is passed
We overstepped: the point of no return
Your life is drawing to a close
Your life is drawing to a close

Babylon's destroyed your kingdom ripped open
Memories in the void, the marks of insane men
Mindless mankind, puppets on stage, files with no name
Mindless mankind, enter a new age, files with no name

Insane spirits assail, only death prevails
Insane spirits assails
We overstepped the point of no return

Babylon's destroyed your kingdom ripped open
Memories in the void, the marks of insane men
Mindless mankind, puppets on stage, files with no name
Mindless mankind, enter a new age, files with no name

Serpent's fiends are all over
Serpent's fiends crawl all over

In freedom you pretend
The marks of insane men
Mad choices you defend
The marks of insane men

Serpent's fiends undercover
Serpent's fiends wait all over
Who's the next sucker?

Only tortures around you, only wounds
No friends, no aid... alone to defend
Torrid winds assault, dirty blast is passed
We overstepped: the point of no return

Who's the next sucker?
Who's the next sucker?
You're the next sucker!
Mindless mankind.
