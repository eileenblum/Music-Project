Entering the last tunnel of life,
As a butterfly locked in a cell of my skull,
My reason's prepared to fly far away.
We will rise together forever with the Holy Ghost.
Knocking the wings against my bones,
Seeking death and my return to you.
Sever my veins, Blood runs free, A flow of pleasure and hope.

A feeling I've always awaited.
From an ugly beast to this winged beauty.
My reason suffers no more.
Desire takes control, I can feel my dead breath.
Sever my veins, Blood runs free, A river of pleasure and hope.

Unfurling my wings spread forever.
Metamorphosis from dusk to dawn.
Dusk to dawn. To dawn.
Anxious to meet you again now I feel your warm breath.

Unfurling my wings spread forever.
Metamorphosis from dusk to dawn.
Dusk to dawn. To dawn.
Anxious to meet you again now I feel your warm breath.
