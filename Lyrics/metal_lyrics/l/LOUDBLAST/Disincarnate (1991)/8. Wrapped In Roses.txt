I mourn the time of my early youth,
Time of binging and indulgence.
Old age came,  obstructing my path,
Finally taking my will.

Despair, Gone is my time.
Downcast, Darker than death.
Birth!
A rose woven, Wreath!
Entwines my cot. Death!
A rose woven, Wreath!
Around my corpse.
Where are those I followed years ago?
Good friends I used to have.
Dropped dead, some've gone with the wind.
May God save those still alive.

Despair, Gone is my time.
Downcast, Darker than death.
Birth!
A rose woven, Wreath!
Entwines my cot. Death!
A rose woven, Wreath!
Around my corpse.

Human brothers surviving us,
Don't resent our offences.
If you remember us with compassion,
God will bless you all.
Birth!
A rose woven, Wreath!
Entwines my cot. Death!
A rose woven, Wreath!
Around my corpse.
