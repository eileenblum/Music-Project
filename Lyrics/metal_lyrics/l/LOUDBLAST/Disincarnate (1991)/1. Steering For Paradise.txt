Let the tomb give its silent lesson.
Let the dead dictate how to live.
Mystic pilgrims against proud scientists, A never ending fight.
Where is the earth from ? Who knows the truth ?
Deaf to all voices, Blind to all shining lights,
It's time for you to steer for... Paradise.

Who can recount the universe's  creation ?
Teach mankind to moralize from man.
Who will explain to us where we come from ?
Pay to error your debt to truth.
Let the bomb give its final answer.
Let us live in a void.
Sons of science building tomorrow, Without knowing yesterday,
Making progress they won't ever control.
Deaf to all voices, Blind to all shining lights,
It's time for you to steer for... Paradise.

Those who solve a problem will soon discover
there are a million more questions.
Who will explain to us what's our future ?
Pay to ignorance your ticket to the unknown.
Is it earth God's defecation.
Teach science to moralize from man.
Show the pagans their way to paradise.
Steer for paradise. Steer for nowhere. Steer for paradise
