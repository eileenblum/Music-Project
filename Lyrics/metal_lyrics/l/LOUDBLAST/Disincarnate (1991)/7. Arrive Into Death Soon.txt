Struck down, weakened by the modern plague,
The organic system reduced to pieces.
Life ebb's away. Obvious misery.
The bell tolls again,  Louder this time.
Disease or punishment.
Arrive Into Death Soon !
Blinded by knowledge.
Into Death Soon. Into Death Soon.
Sickness or punishment ?
Into Death Soon. Into Death Soon.

Scientists looking for fame, Patients ready to die.
Doctors researching for glory as we grieve our loss.
Life ebb's away. Obvious misery.
The bell tolls again,  Louder this time.
Disease or punishment.
Arrive Into Death Soon !
Blinded by knowledge.
Into Death Soon. Into Death Soon.
Sickness or punishment ?
Into Death Soon. Into Death Soon.

Let's refuse to surrender our faith.
The only solution is to forgive.
To forgive our faults...Our faults ?
Disease or punishment.
Arrive Into Death Soon !
Blinded by knowledge.
Into Death Soon. Into Death Soon.
Sickness or punishment ?
Into Death Soon...
