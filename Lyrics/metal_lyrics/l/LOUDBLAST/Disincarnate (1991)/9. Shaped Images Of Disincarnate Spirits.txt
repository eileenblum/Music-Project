Vivid pictures of science's failures,
I'm the embodiment of your usurped theories.
Succession of images while I'm leaving;
Indulgence - Erosion - Punishment - Despair.
Seven stages. Seven Ways of the Cross.
Seven bodies. Seven shaped images. Disincarnate...

Free from my jail of flesh,
Far from my earthly trips. Disincarnate...
Free from my carnal being, Nearer the Celestial Empire.

Obvious evidence of God's disability,
I'm the incarnation of mankind's will.
Succession of images before my eyes;
Abomination - Conscience - Enjoyment - Anguish.
Seven domains. Seven mortal remains.
Seven cages. Seven shaped images. Disincarnate...
Free from my jail of flesh,
Far from my earthly trips. Disincarnate...
Free from my carnal being, Nearer the Celestial Empire.

Seven places. One era of karma.
Seven thoughts but just one living soul ?
The lethal storm is bloating my soul from within.
The Spirit of the Dead outlives Memories of the Mortal.
The final Cross I bore is nothing now but ashes.
The Spirit of the Dead outlives Memories of the Mortal.
