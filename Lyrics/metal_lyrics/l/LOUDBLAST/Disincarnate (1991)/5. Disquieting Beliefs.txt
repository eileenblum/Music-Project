Who's able to soothe our anguish ?
Is religion the way God chose to control out mind ?
To put our spirits in peace ?

And you fear to believe.
Anxious beings, Insane sermons.

Absurdity surmounts. Eviction or you denial to be free ?
Absurdity gets stronger.

to blaspheme his name. And power was given him over
all kindreds, tongues and nations..."
 The knowledge of God implies acceptance of the Antichrist,
And you fear to believe.
