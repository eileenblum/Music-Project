Art is rarely truth
In the realm of mankind
Some are better than others
This world has become schizophrenic

Man your morals will destroy you

What an insane balance
What for unconsciousness
And for what life
Presumption of survival
Unconsciousness the only means of life
Presumption of survival

Morals make man
Modest and tractable
Man is the best
Domestic animal
Your measure is feeble
Your ideals are weak

Man your morals will destroy you

What an insane balance
What for unconsciousness
And for what life
Presumption of survival
Half-tint delight
Presumption of survival

No
You're not free
Hierarchy of taboos overcomes you
Man your morals will destroy your world

Escape
Escape idolatry of the excessive
Break the windows that prevent you to breathe
And jump outside into open-air
Lose your virtue
Escape this cesspool
