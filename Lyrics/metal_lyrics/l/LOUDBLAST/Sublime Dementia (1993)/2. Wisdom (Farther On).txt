Answers to your questions lie elsewhere
Get on with it
Must we overcome or repress impulses to be wise
Or on the contrary must we let those impulses
Rule over us

Knowing its bounds, knowledge of your own
Acting on intuition
First I want to be accessory to my own
Are my impulses the image of my own feelings

Self assurance... thrills
To push back the limits
To size up death... perils of death
Above all no hesitation
Let your soul go where it may
Listening to alternatives
Not forgetting anything, nothing and going farther

Knowing its bounds, knowledge of your own
Acting on intuition
First I want to be accessory to my own
Are my impulses
The image of my own feelings
Of my own feelings

Self assurance... thrills
To push back the limits
To size up death... perils of death
Above all no destination

Knowing its bounds, knowledge of your own
Acting on intuition
First I want to be accessory to my own
Are my impulses the image of my own feelings

Wisdom farther on... farther on
