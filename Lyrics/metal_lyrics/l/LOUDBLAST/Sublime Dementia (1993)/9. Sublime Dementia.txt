A still and peaceful bliss, a glorious resignation
Any contradiction fades away
Any philosophical problem becomes clear, or so it seems
For a long time you haven't been in control
But you're not afflicted by it anymore
Mind absorbed in meditation of an ideal virtue, an ideal charity
And ideal genius

You naively abandon yourself
To your triumphant spiritual orgy
When will we seek happiness?
Hoarse and deep sighs leave your chest as though your former
Body couldn't stand
The desires and the quickness of your new soul
A miasma mischievously clouds your brain soon you will laugh
At your madness
But you can not dismiss it, for your will

Has no more strength
And can not rule your faculties anymore
When will we seek happiness?

Appaling marriage of a man to himself
Because proportions of time and being are completely upset
By multitude and intensity of feelings and ideas
Appalling marriage of a man to himself
Sublime dementia

A human's fanatic lust for any substance
Which exalts his personality
Proves his magnitude

He always aims at exciting his expectations
And at rising to the infinite

Appalling marriage of a man to himself
Because proportions of time and being are completely upset
By multitude and intensity of feelings and ideas
Appalling marriage of a man to himself
Sublime dementia
