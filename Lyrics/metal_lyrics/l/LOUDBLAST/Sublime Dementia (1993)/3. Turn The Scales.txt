We spend our time, so busy
We strive for perfection

But the perfection of common generosity
On the way to chaos

There's a cover of wisdom
Which coats you
Turn the scales
There's a clone of wisdom
Which blind you
Who decides?
Turn the scales

We legislate, we define
We sanction
Not for suffering and sinking
On the way to chaos

There's a cover of wisdom
Which coats you
Turn the scales
There's a clone of wisdom
Which blinds you
Who decides?
Turn the scales

We test your conscience
We exploit your world
The truth is hidden
When is it time for essential satisfaction?

Where is desire?
Where is pleasure?

There's a cover of wisdom, which coats you
Turn the scales
There's a clone of wisdom, which blinds you
Turn the scales
