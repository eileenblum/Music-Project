Fault of my thoughts bring me to dimensions that cannot be grasped
Embryonic jail, a drop in the ocean, a world in a world
Veils of skin become dust, carnal illusions of what we think we are
Nothing but all, myopic ideas eclipse the truth

Countless parts of your spirit unknown by your body hidden deep inside
Billions of systems ignored by our knowledge, veiled in doubt
Look at the mirror of your conscience, yield to the facts, infinity surrounds you
Is within you, is your being, no

Land of fancy, a world within a world
Land of fancy, atom inside the atom
Never ending illusion, inculcated by our fathers
Land of fancy, a world within a world
Land of fancy, atom inside the atom
Easy lie to escape reality

Take me, take me to vanity of human greatness
Free me, free me from the narcissism of human smallness

Land of fancy, a world within a world
Land of fancy, atom inside the atom
Never ending illusion, inculcated by our fathers
Land of fancy, a world within a world
Land of fancy, atom inside the atom
Easy lie to escape reality

Fancies, fancies, fancies, fancies
