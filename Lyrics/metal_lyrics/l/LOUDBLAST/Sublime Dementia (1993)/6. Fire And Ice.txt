A siren living in a sea of liberties
Ecstasy and pain
No one can resist her chant, it revives desire
Overwhelms your body with longing and incestuous sensations

Moment of climax... intense
Preceded with pain... intense
Preceded with pleasure... masochism, masochism

Iâm the haunting shadow of desire, between ecstasy and pain
My bodyâs nothing but fire, madness and desire
Iâve become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice

The love I lavish constitutes
An unthinkable experience
Made of sensual pleasure, suffering, delight
My suffering, your pleasure

Iâm the haunting shadow of desire, between ecstasy and pain
My bodyâs nothing but fire, madness and desire
Iâve become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice

Iâm the haunting shadow of desire, between ecstasy and pain
My bodyâs nothing but fire, madness and desire
Iâve become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice
Iâve become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice
Between fire and ice
Between fire and ice
