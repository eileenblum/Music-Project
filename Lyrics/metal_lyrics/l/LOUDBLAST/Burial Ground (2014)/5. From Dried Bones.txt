As I look above, as I look below
A body, abstract
A world, abstract
As I look above, as I look below
A god, abstract
Myself, abstract

Surrounded but empty
Alone but many
Piercing eyes
Awakening

From dried bones a rebirth
A soul freed from its chains
On empty grounds can rise
From dried bones a rebirth
A soul freed from its chains
On empty grounds can rise
A new start, a new eon

From dried bones a rebirth
On empty grounds can rise
