As a carrion crow approachhing the mass
As a bloody oath, vicious and crass,
A voodoo spell that went a tad bit wrong,
That will take you back where you belong,
A bloody oath.

An old picture that should never have seen the light
Lightning, thunder, helping seeing bright,
Brainless enemies not even ready for the fight.

Too bad for you, our eyes have seen.
Too bad for you, our ears have heard.
Too bad for you, we still can read
Between the lines and through your lies.

Turning your world upside down,
And down, and down.
Pandora's box is filled with random numbers
And lots of dirt.

Dust won't cover the stains
Blood won't cover the stench
Spikes won't cover your back
Satan won't protect the rats.

Screams won't cover your lies
Angel dust was not made for you.
And gates open only to spit on you.

Turning your world upside down,
And down, and down.
A bloody oath,
Some pieces no longer fit the great scheme.
A bloody oath.

Turning your world upside down,
And down, and down.
A bloody oath,
Cleansing fire, lots of dirt.
A bloody oath.
