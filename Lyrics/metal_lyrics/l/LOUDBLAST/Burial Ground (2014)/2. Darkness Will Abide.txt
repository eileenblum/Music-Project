Undefeated we stand
Yet unmarked by ordeals raised before us
Different as four can be
We ride the nocturnal winds
Fierce, we walk amongst the nameless shadows
Making our way as we see it

Beware, those who cross our path
For wisdom and truth march by our side
Beware, those who cross our path

Summon now the loud forces of the earth
Still shaking, trying to grasp our words

Only vengeance will you find
Only darkness will abide

Beware, those who cross our path
For wisdom and truth march by our side
Beware, those who cross our path
Feel our wrath, feel our wrath
For wisdom and truth march by our side

Nature is roaring
Death calls us to wake by her shiny bed
The enchanted spirits will guide us
Their legacy will outlive this puny world
Death calls us to wake by her shiny bed

Against all odds
A shooting pain unites
Ascent is the step above
For our souls a fight

Against all odds
Ascent is the step above
Against all odds
For our souls a fight

Beware, those who cross our path
For wisdom and truth march by our side
Beware, those who cross our path
Feel our wrath, feel our wrath
For wisdom and truth march by our side

Only darkness will abide
