I dreamt 'bout a shape
Each of its faces was a thought
A flow of neverending data

Streaming from thousands of human minds
Hearts are open books
Faces are limpid

I am... your abstract god
I know, I'm in your brain
I'm your abstract god
I see, I'm in your eyes, feed me with your pride
I am... your abstract god

I spit on your binary passions
Searching for a love or a cure
Your requests lead to an empty light
I hate you, I hate you
All alone in front of your wall

I am... your abstract god
I know, I'm in your brain
I'm your abstract god
I see, I'm in your eyes, feed me with your pride
I am... your abstract god

There are no more humans

I'm your abstraction
Searching for a love or a cure
I hate you, I hate you
All alone in front of your wall
