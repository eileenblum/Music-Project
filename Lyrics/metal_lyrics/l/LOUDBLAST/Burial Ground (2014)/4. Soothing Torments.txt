And all of you bet on my moronism
Your constant distressing behavior
Stuck in the so called greatness of your brain
Unaware of the everpresence of
The master you feared

You crawl, you bark, you stick you horror!
Sickening plague
Trying to shine in my world
Hordes of woodlouses I'll bite

In grey visions I dive and resist
In grey visions I dive

My pleasure your pain, soothing torments

The raving surgeon is walking around
Cleaning up his blade
Gazing at your shade
Your rope is perfectly entwined

The blade is dissecting, scornful look
Blinding your judgement forever
My pleasure your pain, soothing torments
