As above, the polarities
Seem so prone to change
Attracted rejection
Inverted union

What is lying there, dormant?
Is there anything to save?
When all they ever handed
Ends up dried out and seared

But not my heart, nor my soul

But not my heart, nor my soul
Empty of their scorn and their lies
Filled by the blessed unknown
To their blindness, but my eyes

But not my heart, nor my soul

I scorched my wings
On their petty fire
But still I float above
Radiant child of the stars

I scratched my skin
On their blunt blades
But still I felt their breath
And still I reached the sun
And still I reached the sun

I rise, I stand, I fall
I fell, I stood, I rose
The very purest of light
