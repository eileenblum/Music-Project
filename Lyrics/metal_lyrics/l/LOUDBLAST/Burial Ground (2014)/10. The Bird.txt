[Bonus Track]Speechless, silent, blank and mute
Deaf, but not trying to hear
Empty, angry, dignity
The bird returned to ashes
A pain you can't hold
Sorrow can't be solved

The voice has changed
From the sky the bird left
Iron willed

Phoenix what have you done?
The crow, dreadfull messenger you've become
For your divine feathers
Left us with anger

Where are your sowed fields?
Which plot of land have you fed?
Which world are we to walk in?
Phoenix what have you done?
Where can we fearlessly love and howl?
Phoenix what have you done?

Phoenix what have you done?
The crow, dreadfull messenger you've become
For your divine feathers
Left us with anger

As you fly high and above the universe
Meeting divinities and gods
Tell me bird
What shape will you take to land by our side?

Phoenix what have you done?
The crow, dreadfull messenger you've become
For your divine feathers
Left us with anger
Phoenix what have you done?
Left us with anger
