Horus, I can't see you
(Who blinded me)
Aton, I can't feel you
(Where are we)
Sothis, take me somewhere else
(When are we leaving)

Landless scorched earth
Epidemia
Landless scorched earth
Contagious
A healthy ground on which to walk?
These mute voices
Guiding me in barren space

Let us devour our tail
Choking on spirals of lies

A wide open maze
I flew around, my choice

And deal with the void

Let us devour our tail
Choking on spirals of lies

Let me swallow
The final saviour
Let me swallow
And deal with the void

"I saw you, having a bite
On this sacred vestigial tail
Now blasted
No more sane ground for you to walk on"

Horus, I can't see you
Who blinded me
Aton, I can't feel you
Sothis, take me somewhere else

I leave...
