Beware the demons you conjured in darkness
Beware the monsters you designed
In their blackness
Beware the "satan" you are screaming for in vain

Are you ready to see his real face?

Who is the demon you unleashed?
Who is the monster you've created?
Who are these "satans" you're so desperate for?
Are you ready to see their multifacets?

Are you ready to see

I blinded my eyes
And still I chased the real
I blinded my eyes
Muting their empty words
I blinded my eyes
But still I catch voices

I blinded my eyes
And still I chased the real
I blinded my eyes
But still I catch voices

Beware the kiss of the snake cold
No need to even lay a hand
No need to even say a word
The mirror will

I scourged my flesh
On their maze of "torments"
But crippled yet unbowed
I scourged my flesh
On their maze of "torments"
Still I walk the path
