Sculpturing your world with passionate craft
Spinning the wheels of impending doom
I bit the pall, I now see through walls
I am ascending straight in circles

Biting your tongue, gnawing your tail
Reach the cycle to higher grounds
Biting your tongue, gnawing your tail
Beat the circle from where you bound
From where you bound

Dazzling blackness, obscur clarity
Your endless motions will set us free
Burning darkness, no more linearity

What you have is what you see

With grandour they shed corrosive tears
Filling the whole creation with fear
And do they know how I feel?
How many tears so I can take my leave?

Soundless echoes surrounding
That blissful mystical lane
Your mouth full of excrement ain't
No more excruciating pain
Coz I now see through walls
I can now see through walls
I am ascending straight in circles
I am ascending straight in circles
