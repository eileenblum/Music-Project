[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez, N. Leclercq]

Am I arrived 
At the end of my pains ?
The fire that is consuming life 
Is slowly dying out
Some frozen tears come blurring my hopes

The spirit who carries my body
Hides away from his reflect
'Cause the vision makes him sick
This twin who's watching him's so scared

Nothing more warms up my thoughts
Love I felt is consumed
And I am moving off my reflection
Who's watching me behind the glass ?
His frozen tears turned away my hopes

The spirit who carries my body
Hides away from his reflect
'Cause the vision makes him sick
This twin who's watching him's so scared

Frozen tears come to me

Come to me
Come to me

Come to me
Frozen tears come to me
Come to me
Frozen tears come to me
