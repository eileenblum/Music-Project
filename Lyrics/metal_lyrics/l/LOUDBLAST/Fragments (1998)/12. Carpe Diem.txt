[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez, N. Leclercq]

Carpe diem
Nothing has ever been defined
Except an ideal of future
Future always remains to be built
Through the ages, our trip

Always begin, again and again
There are instincts you can't repress
Share my vibes

You, you are the mistress, I am the slave
I may be destroyed
By the violence of my passion

Carpe diem
Nothing has ever been defined
Except an ideal of future
Future always remains to be built
Through the ages, our trip

Always begin, again and again
I, I could be reborn
Through the violence of your passion

The candle's burning
The bite's so sharp
Ready to fall on your knees
Ready to obey your will
