[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

Phases, only phases
How do I fulfil the emptiness of my life ?

I admit I discover another me
I am afraid of what I could do
I am sure of what I should be

Time presses, get to move on
Time presses, the river is still flowing

Test my mystery, write my story
I test your mystery to find my history
Taste me in the land of plenty

Seeking the recipe of eternity
Seeking the best expression of life
To exploit the sexual intercourse

Time presses, get to move on
Time presses, the river is still flowing

Test my mystery, write my story
I test your mystery to find my history
Taste me in the land of plenty
Taste me in the land of plenty

Fulfil the emptiness of my life
By fulfilling yours
Phases, only phases

Phases, only phases
Life is not an ulterior motive
Write my story

I test your mystery to find my history
Taste me in the land of plenty
