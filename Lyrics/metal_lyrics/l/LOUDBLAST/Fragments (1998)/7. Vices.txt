[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

Like, like a victim
Facing a corrupt justice
I was guilty to prefer
The word "to be" than any other

In spite of all disgust I felt
I forgot my dignity
I adapted myself

I didn't reach the limits
Neither my body nor mind
I want to bleed, torture myself 'till I bleed
I turn away from all virtues
I turn away from all taboos
I assume vices revealed inside me

Vices

As a slave I became
Feeding myself on wastes
Vice is surrounding me
Pain is burning deep inside me

In spite of all disgust I felt
I forgot my dignity
I adapted myself

I didn't reach the limits
Neither my body nor mind
I want to bleed, torture myself 'till I bleed
I turn away from all virtues
I turn away from all taboos
I assume vices revealed inside me

In spite of all disgust I felt
I forgot my dignity, my dignity

I didn't reach the limits
Neither my body nor mind
I want to bleed, torture myself 'till I bleed
I turn away from all virtues
I turn away from all taboos
I assume vices revealed inside me
