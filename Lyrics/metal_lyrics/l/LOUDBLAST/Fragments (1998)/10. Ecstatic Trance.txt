[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

Life, you are life
You are delighting my senses
Am I delighting yours ?

Don't think anymore
Open your heart to those dazzling colors

Senses, your senses are haunting me
Time has come, listen to your body talk
Like it never did before

Don't think anymore
Open your heart to those haunting rhythms

Licking the fruits of our sins
'Till the ecstatic trance
Ecstatic trance
I am finding delight
In your ecstatic dance
You make me high

Melting, melting our obsessions
With our perversions
And getting drunk on forbidden liquors

Don't think anymore
Open your heart to those dazzling colors

Licking the fruits of our sins
'Till the ecstatic trance
Ecstatic trance
I am finding delight
In your ecstatic dance
You make me high

You make me high
You make me high
You make me high

Licking the fruits of our sins
'Till the ecstatic trance
Ecstatic trance
I am finding delight
In your ecstatic dance
You make me high

I am finding delight
In your ecstatic dance
You make me high
