[Lyrics: S. Buriez]
[Music: S. Buriez, N. Leclercq]

Flesh, the subject of my sins
Juicy, the liquor of my debaucheries
Wet, draining with desire
YouÂre wet, so wet

Red hot, the fire of my senses
Lips, watered by my seeds
Throat, the organ that will drink me until the end
YouÂre thirsty, so thirsty

Come and taste the wine of liberty
Free within your flesh
Let your body confronts with real sexuality
Deep inside your flesh, your flesh

Put another "X" in sex, go further and further
Put another "X" in sex, bite stronger and stronger

Lust, the only word that will guide me until the end
Tongue, the precious arrow that reach me to make me come

Come and taste the wine of liberty
Free within your flesh
Let your body confronts with real sexuality
Deep inside your flesh, your flesh

Flesh...
