[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

My childish emotions remain
Moments of delicious surrender occur
Eternal vibrations, those are my roots
Natural and wild, wild and natural

But today it's war, the soul's war
Within me, I against I

Today it's war, inside of me
Life is a fight, I against I

I remember my detention
Initiation into modern rites, ancient rites
Bridle on my head with taboos as guardians
Where is my nature, my real nature ?

But today it's war, the soul's war
Within me, I against I

Today it's war, inside of me
My life is a fight, I against I

Free... wounded and free
Free... wounded and free
Free... wounded and free...
