[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

Dear mistress, merciless dominant
I ask you for training me
To the last limits of my body and mind
I grovel to you
I: an object of lust, useful to others

Into the keep, I shall be your slave, absolutely docile
Into the keep, I shall enjoy your cruelty

Into the keep

If I complain, my training will surely be mortal
And if I moan, my training will be more cruel

Into the keep, I shall be your slave, absolutely docile
Into the keep, I shall enjoy your cruelty

Into the keep

If I wait, I'll know the constant bite of the whip's touch
No threat, oh no, just a bite, the whiplash

Into the keep, into the keep

Mistress, I won't forget you
For you've saved my life
Mistress, I won't forget you
You've marked my own flesh and blood

Dear mistress, princess of bondage
I remain at your feet
As an enslaved bitch, mortify me !
