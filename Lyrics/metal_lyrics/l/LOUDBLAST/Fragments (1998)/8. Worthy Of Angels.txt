[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

Your gazes down upon me
Opened my heart, I felt exulted
Dreaming of our ways
Drawing closer and closer
And never, never touching itselves
Just containing myself for more ecstasy

A frustration full of hope

Worthy of angels
Want to feel myself
Worthy of angels
Want to touch the sky

When hope is dying
Passion fades away
Phantasms pass away
And feelings fades away
Reality could never satisfy me
As my phantasms do

A frustration full of hope

Worthy of angels
Want to feel myself
Worthy of angels
Want to touch the sky

Touch the sky, the sky

Worthy of angels
Want to feel myself
Worthy of angels
Want to touch the sky

Touch the sky, touch the sky
Want to feel myself, feel myself
