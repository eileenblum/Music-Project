[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

True moral mocks
Society's divine rules
You're not the master
Of your desires

Mother nature unique terrestrial master
We were born, but are living in a cruel world

Where nature's laws are the first religion
Where nature's laws are the last religion

Everywhere homicide, wars, lies, betrayal
Everywhere gold, the pleasure of being

Born in fake
Fake emotions world
Where perceptions
Can't be experienced

Everywhere excess and waste, lies, betrayal
Everywhere gold, the pleasure of being, being, being

And man continuously tries to surpass himself
And man continuously defies the laws of nature

Man's own, man's own, man's own

Mother nature unique terrestrial master
We were born, but are living in a cruel world

Man's own, man's own, man's own
