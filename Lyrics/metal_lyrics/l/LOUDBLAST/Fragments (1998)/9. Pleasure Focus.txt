[Lyrics: F. Jamin]
[Music: S. Buriez]

True feelings
Get rid of brainwashing
If not your submission will be painful
Give me your inner liquor
My favourite secret beverage
Accept to be an object of lust

Pleasure focus, ground's dissolving
A cloud of delight in obscure firmament

Open yourself, life is a game
Blow up your mind, pleasure focus
I'm gonna come, pleasure focus

True feelings
No revolt, no repress
Drunk with secret liquor
Adrenaline's boost
Acts are made faster than thoughts
Your body is the altar of our games

Pleasure focus, ground's dissolving
A cloud of delight in obscure firmament

Pleasure focus, ground's dissolving
A cloud of delights
Pleasure focus, ground's dissolving

Open yourself, keep on playing
Blow up your mind, pleasure focus
I come, taste my cum
Pleasure focus, pleasure focus
