[Lyrics: S. Buriez]
[Music: S. Buriez]

Digging deep inside my own labyrinth, seeking for my phantasm
There is no way to find a compromise
Good or evil, it means nothing anymore
I'm frightened, my will's nothing more but dreams
Am I in the wrong train ?

So attractive, so unsafe ?
I'm walking on a razor's edge

Excited to decide my own fall
Excited to decide my own fall

I live my perversions within my head
This frustration makes my senses boiling but feeds my hopes
Is life just a way covered with temptations ?
I'm frightened, my will's nothing more but dreams
Am I in the wrong train ?

So attractive, so unsafe ?
I'm walking on a razor's edge

Excited to decide my own fall
Excited to decide my own fall
Excited to decide my own fall, my own fall

Sharing could be an end
Egoism is the river
Everflowing, feeding my luxury

So attractive, so unsafe ?
I'm walking on a razor's edge

Excited to decide my own fall
Excited to decide my own fall
Excited to decide my own fall
