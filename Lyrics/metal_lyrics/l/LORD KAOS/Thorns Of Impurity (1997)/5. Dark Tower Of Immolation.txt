Ancient countess, chills of frozen fog,
her eyes blood red wine
Stare through my human form
Your soul impure of thoughts
Gothic castle, morbid red lightning glowing the sky

Hell spawn storm, the moon swallowing
Thoughts of demonic ice plains
As I touch your coldness of touch
Water so black with death, I drink from the murky depths
Feel the cries one level not lost

Wicked summoning of demons, black occultism
Prophetic dreams of immolation
Holy men placed on burning pyres
Burning their sacred cloth to ashes
Desecrate halls of being, release their life
Hail to my black witch of the morbid lake

Shrouds of virgin born skin, so white as the moonlight sky
Pure as your touch, fingernails so dark
Sign of evil within my hands, you scream the pain of daylight
Enter the last creation
Black alchemist as you are
Opens the hellhole to the dark lords infernal domain
Entangle me with beauty and misery
Pantheon after death
Dark tower black and mournful
