I'm falling down climbing up
Trancemission undivine
Rotten smell, deadbeat sound
And rustle of dry blood

Here and now
Dignity is nothing but grey dust
Worthless prayers of the sheep
This is the blasphemy!

Inhale, exhale, inside out
Time shrinks, time distends
Diluted consciousness selects with care
The vilest verses which praise thy name

Throbbing chaosphere
Unholyunion of mind and will
I'm still yearning, I'm waiting still
Soul hot varices lead me to bliss
