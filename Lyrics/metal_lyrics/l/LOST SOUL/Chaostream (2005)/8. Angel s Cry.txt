Licking my wounds
Yet raw and festering
This is how I bless me rebirth
I am dressed with flesh and bones
Another perfect incarnation

Here to read with trembling hands
The mystery hidden deep within
Writing in thy flames, I'll rise again
The most forgotten one

To see... what dwells beneath
To hear... Angel's Cry
Frozen vestige of my desire
It is all what I've left untouched

Self-infected mind in slumber hunts
For winged shapes screaming in the dark
Evocation, the seal is breaking now
Of astral trap into they all fell

Timeless dimensions never to the blind
Are still unknown so close but far away
And the greedy eyes say the same again
...It must be somewhere there...
