Dive into abyss with wide open eyes
All is one, all is none
Remember to forget, no regret
Come and stand on the edge

Taste the fruits of forbidden art
Touch the darkshining side of light
A little word, glorious "I"
Come and shout it loud!

I swallow this world
Pill after pill, step by step
From station to station
From man into god

The unveiling ecstasy
Magick is my key
So, listen now let it be clear
Restriction is the word of sin

Some of pleasure and a bit of pain
Passion is my burning flame
Towards great Nothing
As the beast I ride
Crossing threshold of your being
