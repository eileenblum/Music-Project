Have you ever really seen
The one you kneel before
Like worms crawling at his feet
To be free

Suffering!

This shameful race
This formless mass of stench
Who's sharing both their own ignorance
And blindness

Pain
The price you have to pay
This is your promised land
Almost heaven

Welcome to owr world
We need no golden throne
No great plan to lead the way
And angels flying above our heads

Cruelty is the language we use
Whiphering to the ear of God
In empty veins chaos speaks
Through the cracks
Of the soul wisdom bleeds
