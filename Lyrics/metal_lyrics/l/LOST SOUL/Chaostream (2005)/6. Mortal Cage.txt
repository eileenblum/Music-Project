Step out of this mortal cage
Sweet pain injection
Reason melts in toxic waves
Life, the great delusion

Velvet soft the touch divine
The poison moves the blood
Train your senses and turn them off
Open doors to nameless naught

Little ways to paradise
Take on these wings and fall
Spectral presence
The body of light
Tell me who is going to deny?

Internal war consumes my boiling brain
This sacrifice must be done
A dangerous addiction
Secret transformansion
Superior experience for the high self
