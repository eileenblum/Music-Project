Let Heavens hear our cries
Anthems of eternal adoration
Crushing the house of divine charity

We want god, Our Will
Let be the breath of our deeds
Nails driven into his holy flesh
Will crush the house of divine charity

Let it be our destiny
We're waiting for your sign
We'll greet you with embrace of death

We want god
Burning in rapture
We want god
Kill him!

Don't be afraid... just leave your concealment
