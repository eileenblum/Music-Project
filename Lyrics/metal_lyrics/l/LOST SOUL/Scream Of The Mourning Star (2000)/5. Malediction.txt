To the New Light!
Guided by darkness
Sons of luciferian fire
Blacker than blackness
Where blissful silence
For those who can hear

What is Below, is Below
Shall stay behind
Let us drink this filthy life
From the chalice of malediction

Unholy ways on which we stride
Unholy waters in which we drown

The Fiery Serpent wreathes in my bowels
Deadly cure I inject
To be like they are, against them
Only king can be a beggar
Never inversely

And the flesh became a word
Here are our voices of hatred
Won't tolerate the pride
Drawled from the sources of ignorance

Forbidden shall be forbidden
Covered shall be covered
