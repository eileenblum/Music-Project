Eclipse complete
A very first vision
Is the first silent warning
For eyes and ears
Obsessed by colours and sounds

Cold, deepest, empty space
And nothing more
The pain of birth
Is this the face of god?

Incantation
Warmed up soul hunger
Coronation
The absurd revealed

Shy little step
Into no light world beyond

There's no images
There's no voice
I'm swallowed by thickend dark
Cold, deepest, empty space
And nothing more
The pain of birth
Is this the face of god?

Incantation
Warmed up soul hunger
Coronation
The absurd revealed
