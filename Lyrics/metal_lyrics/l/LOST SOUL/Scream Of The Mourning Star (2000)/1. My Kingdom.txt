My Kingdown rises
As the others fall...

Curse me!
I want to feel this rage
Punish me!
It's a sap for my trees

No forgiveness
World in flames of ecstasy
Jesus christ closed his eyes
Shamefully

Isolation
No man can see the light of my black sin
Blessed your lunatic black hearts

Deformed by bastards by envy - not yours
I come to you my children

Dress me with pain
Of savage pleasures
Your rejoice will be mine
As feeding on horned angels tears
