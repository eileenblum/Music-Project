Fill the lungs with its breath
As the lured smell strikes the nostrils
Close your eyes and drown in rapture
Of debauched None

Corrupted by dark
We're riding the brightness
Drunken with madness
We dance in the arms of... Fire!

Flesh from my flesh
Blood from my blood
Here is my bleeding art
Let's unify
In the nameless rite

Put away all resist
Reject all twisted prayers
The one which stand above
No need a vilest rhyme

Corrupted by dark
We're riding the brightness
Drunken with madness
We dance in the arms of... FIRE!
