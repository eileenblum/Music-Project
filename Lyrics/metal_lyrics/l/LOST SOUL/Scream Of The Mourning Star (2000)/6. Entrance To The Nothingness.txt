Screaming, shrieking, louder, harder,
I lacerated my spirit seal
The nearness of Beast

Entrance to the Nothingness

No sanity remain
Trampled masks of the virgin light
I'm diving with my hissing wounds
In a calmly pulsating wilderness

Magick Poison
My blackened blood now boils
In total silence
Chaos, infinite

Screaming, shrieking, louder, harder,
I lacerated my spirit seal
I'm diving with my hissing wounds
In a calmly pulsating wilderness
