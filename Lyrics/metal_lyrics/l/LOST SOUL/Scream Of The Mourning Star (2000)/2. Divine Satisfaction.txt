Worshippers of silence
Don't tell me about it's majesty
You're troubling with your cursed yell
Eternal dream of my lover

Let your lips become silent forever

Worshippers of mystery
Never able to be known
Shake up black pearls
Of your own surmises

My Temple is not for your sake
And the sweetness of Divine Satisfaction

Do reverence to mighty lord
He appeases oceans haunted by fury
And slakes the burning fire
In the heart of every... slave

With voluptuous glance
I'm charming
With the greedy palms
I'm tearing the rags of deceit
He's naked, weak
Look at me!
I'm burning his eyes with my growing desire

Don't chant my name
Worshippers of everyone
Calmed down revolt
Poisoned with spirit degradation
As the biggest servant on the Earth
Here's the power conferred upon you

Clandestine circle which shall never be

My Temple is not for your sake
And the sweetness of Divine Satisfaction
