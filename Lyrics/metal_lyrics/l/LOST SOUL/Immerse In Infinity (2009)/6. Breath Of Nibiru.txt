I lived...
When you came
Carried by the winds
With one breath,
A warm gust
You blew the seeds from your hands

Thousands of suns abashed
When your wandering smile
Embraces the sky
The tear-wet
Flowers grow in my heart

Two grains of stardust
Of the opposite potential
Speed across the universe
And dancing in embrace
They paint the light tails

Millions of stars abashed
Will soon stop shedding their light
Turning their sight
From the glitter
Drawn by two little worlds

The rain of cosmic stones
Dispelled the illusions
Impeccable seeds with no sin
Shattered and left in silence

Send billions of thoughts abashed
Throughout the sky
With just a silent whisper
Justify the warm shivers
Discovering they are together
