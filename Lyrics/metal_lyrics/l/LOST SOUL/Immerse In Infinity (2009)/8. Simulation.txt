Crucified by the arms of dead rulers
Captivated by vanity of monochromatic authorities
Devoid of natural mechanisms
I look down trying to catch a breath
Disconnected from my own thoughts
By one -- dimensional madmen

Fear! Vain shadows of mankind
Here comes the end of your time
The world roars about your cunning
Rot! Thinking that you are ready to die

We will suppress your simulation
Whoever you are

Disconnected from my own thoughts
By one -- dimensional madmen

I curse the myths of hypocritical systems
No respect for global manipulation
Swept away by whirl of billions galaxies
I don't want to know how your fate goes
I drown in oblivion

We will suppress your simulation
Whoever you are

In my secret abyss
I have my steel cross
Bleeding deadly venom
I wriggle in thick thorns

I will never give up
As long as my blood doesn't flow
I will scream louder and louder
(...till death do us part)
As there is no resurrection!

Where is your way
Hair -- shirt clad penitent
You seek destination you will never reach
Disconnected from your own thoughts
By one -- dimensional madmen

Fear! Vain shadows of mankind
Here comes the end of your time
The world roars about your cunning
Rot! Thinking that you are ready to die

We will suppress your simulation
Whoever you are

...whichever army recruited you
It's time to comprehend
Your life has value!
