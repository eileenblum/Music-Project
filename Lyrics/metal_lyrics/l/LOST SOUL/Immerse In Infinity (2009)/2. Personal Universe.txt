Welcome to my hell
Where I am the universe
Living in the midst of a simulated nonsense
I distort your human image into likeness of me
At the edge of madness
Helming the ship to no one knows where

Devouring the minds of the haunted
I steal light from my soul
With animal fury
I fight in the name of the equilibrium
Diving into chaos
I choke on smell of earthly air

Meditating in torment
I can feel your cold
The scent of nothingness
...can you hear me?!

The burning heavens
Bleed with your existence
Lions deprived of your kingdom

Life is a river
A drop of water
Fallen at the feet of waterfall

I set sails
Infused by the wind
Like a woman's breast
They drive my ship
The souls shattered by the ship's side
Glitter in sunshine
Washed away by the wave
Wander in infinite oceans

The stars show me the way
I orbit on the ocean's sheet
I use salt water to wash my wounds
The souls mixed with blood
Roar in my chest
My thunder eyes
Burn the mast and sails
To see your blazing face

Because I am the universe here
Living in the midst of simulated nonsense
I distort your human image into likeness of me
At the edge of madness
Helming the ship to no one knows where

If the springs start sucking water
Will the rivers flow against the stream?
And waterfalls become dams
Or oceans pump the water back the rivers?
Will south become north
And my ship reach the goal?
My personal universe?

...can you hear me?
