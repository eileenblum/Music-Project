Here comes the time of new processes of world
How much can you close your eyes
To see the invisible?
How far can you escape
To find the truth in solitude?

Fate, unstoppable!

What fear roots deep down in your mind?
Who planted distrust in your heart?
Rise up high above the clouds
To feel the omen of the new age
Are you a cog of the plan?
The question is my answer

You never know what befalls you
Mother, we'll rise
Father, we'll rise
War in the skies
Hell, earth, flesh, universe

Faith with no celebrations
We won't suffer for your world
Awaiting fate
Look in the stars
May the light be your darkness!

Close your eyes, feel the flow of your blood
Read the message in the skies
Your veins as the underground tunnel
Press the force
You are a cog of the plan
Plan of the ancients

You never know what befalls you
Mother, we'll rise
Father, we'll rise
War in the skies
Hell, earth, flesh, universe

Faith with no celebrations
We won't suffer for your world
Awaiting fate
Look in the stars
May the light be your darkness!
