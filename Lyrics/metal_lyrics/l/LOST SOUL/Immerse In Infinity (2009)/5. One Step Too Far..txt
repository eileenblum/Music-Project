Transmutation
...I feel the taste of xerion
As the fireeyed falcon
See to the river of no source or mouth
In my own microcosm
I soak in the particles of matter
With surgical precision
I cut my gem

Demiurge

Every day and every night
With no needless moves
Just cold sound judgment
Absorbed with creation
...I am consciously taking one step too far

Ouroboros
Now I am two -- mouth
Sublimation
Two states -- it is no enough
I belch heretic poison
I strive to the triple point
I blare cosmic radiance
The pleasure of annihilation

In the microcosmic madness
I am consciously taking one step too far
Disturbing the process of endless repetition
