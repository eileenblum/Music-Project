Chaos - my destination
Endurance makes me strong
To burn down all that hope
Not even shreds and dust remain

Slowly... surrounded darkness
Forbidden space deep within
No human screams, no noise is here
I shut the door of life

Deeper and deeper, do not look back
Spectral friends lead us again
Time stops for here we come
The birds of storm

Chaos - my destination
Behold! Here's the key

With every step, in every breath I take
The high explosion is unavoidable
Things dispersed now become one
All the barriers are vanished at once
