We are the Poison in vipers' sea
And secret light of the Mourning Star
Trembling shadows bleed with fear
Blindly they try to bite
A great Void spreads the dark above
There is no blessing for this dying world

A vision of the agony
It's all now, what I see
The curse I speak
Is cruel dawn of misery

The end is near...
Silence is so loud
To hear the voice of fate
But stings are waiting
Ready and tense
In caustic streams
Our hidden crime
Awakening
Brings them another defeat
