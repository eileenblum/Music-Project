To bridle the Beast is vain attempt
To train the flames seems easy to learn
From heart-shape box sucked out the pain
A name that scald unquiet mind
This is sweet fever for hungry eyes
Eternity's gate is opened wide
Release this fury burning inside
The plague of madness cling to me now

Unstoppable
My eager soul
The Dawn of Star
Brighter than Sun

More and more until the end
Your holy nectar won't quench my thirst
I feel the scorn drying on lips
I relish disease

This is the taste of promised reward
This is the treasure for those alone
Who fearless has gone to the other side
At rainbow's end, the chosen race
