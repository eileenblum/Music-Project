Courage my friend!
Forget yourself
Leave all behind
Release your fear
The world denied

I am the bringer of the Void

It is a long trip
Of soul that will never rest
So, take deep breath
'cause we are going home

To the New Light
Can you hear the Serpent's call
To the New Light
You shall fall ...
Find it, absorb
Teach your children how to fly
Love is the Law
Will is the core

Listen my friend!
Remember unholy ways
Burning inside your head
The world is your again ...
