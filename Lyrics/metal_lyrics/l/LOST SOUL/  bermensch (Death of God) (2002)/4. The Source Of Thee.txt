Here are the words
We were all waiting for
The secret message comes from beyond
Here is the sign
Completely blinded our eyes
The spark of Wisdom shines so bright

And as the flames
We dance on the stake of faith
And as the plague
We spread new heresy

In the name of Lust
That keeps my soul undead
I rise and fall
Yet, beside me still you are
This is silent worship
No rites, no prayers too
Just only pure Will
Taken from the source of Thee

Appear!
Be my guide
In the darkness drown my pain
... and I ...
