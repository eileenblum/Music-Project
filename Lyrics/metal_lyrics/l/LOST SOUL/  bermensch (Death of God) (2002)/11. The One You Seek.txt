Shadows creeping behind me
And my Will is too fast
How they beg for mercy
But there's no time to rest

Shadows creeping behind me
With the stumps of their thirst
What a sight of mediocrity
When their faith-corns bleed

Brothers, I conjure you!
Never slow down in front of the Abyss
Only one step is enough
To disbelievers become unseen

Men, shadows of this world
Trying to keep pace with me
I have no gift of immortality
I am not the One you seek
