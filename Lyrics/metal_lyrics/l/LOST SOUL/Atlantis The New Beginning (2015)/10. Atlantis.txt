Smaragdus
Regnum
Obscuritas

Far beyond the field of roses
Into infinitude of dark matter
Far beyond the kingdom of all dimensions
Laced bridge over pulsating caldera

I flow through to the other side
Among the mountains supported by streams of lava

Pylons undulate in the Wind
Far away
Shrouded by Fog
The golden city of... Atlantis

Electrochemical impulses illuminate the dark night
The triangular eye of the devil inflames the skies

I see...

So I will give Life to All
Is Carnal in your Parts
Fornication Uncleanness
Greed and Lust
I shall bless you

Atlantis
The end of my way
Atlantis

Smaragdus
Regnum
Obscuritas

Landing on the last planet
There is no other mission

Atlantis
I've returned home
Atlantis
Give birth my son
