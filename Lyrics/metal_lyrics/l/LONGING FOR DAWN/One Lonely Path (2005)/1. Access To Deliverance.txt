At the edge or our demise the crossroads of existence
A brutal awakening a sad reflection of who we truly are
The menace an altered consciousness architect of my purgatory
Restless but destructive it will die wondering
At the fortress of my withdrawal survivor of the aftermath
The sweet redemption of scavengers on my soul
