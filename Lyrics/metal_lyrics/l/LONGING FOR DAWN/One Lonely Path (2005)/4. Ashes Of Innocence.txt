In your eyes unspoiled the promise of a better day broken
Bitterness when leaves are falling the dark clouds of sorrow
The dread you create shallow cries in the night desperately
Seeking a fragile shelter to hide an outlet for the mind
Those miserable conditions forsaken the blood runs cold
Despite the illusions it was written in the sky
Only in darkness the heart becomes one
