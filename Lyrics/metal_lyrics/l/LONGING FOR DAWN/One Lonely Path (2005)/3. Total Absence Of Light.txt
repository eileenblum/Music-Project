All I ever wanted dried out withered under the sun
The wage of ascension the golden years cease to exist wiped
Out the Harmful way Heaven's denial illusive dreams remain
From yesterday's passion a repulsive assembly echoes from the
Ugly sounds of what was defiant listen to this uncertainty
This imminent destruction this unbearable affliction
