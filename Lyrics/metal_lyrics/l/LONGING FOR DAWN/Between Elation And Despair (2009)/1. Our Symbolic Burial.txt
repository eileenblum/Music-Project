Everytime you were searching for me each time a knife twist in my heart

As if it's just begun to realize the consequence of neglecting such radiance
Come brighter than ever leave me blind say your precious lies all over again

When mountains were moving at our will two drowning souls dreaming of the surface

What drew you so close?
Now show me how to stop the rain
In a blink of an eye to let the shadows lengthen

A helping hand to confront what has been sown to choke on what we have done wrong
Just try and forgive and let us believe the feelings were true and real
