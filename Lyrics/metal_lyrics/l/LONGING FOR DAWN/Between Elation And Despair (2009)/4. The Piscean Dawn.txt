Sent from above with a broken wing, will we hit the ground together?
Crushing down at the source of your attraction my peaceful river became a cascading fall
Knowing that everything lasts but for a while
Your absence beams through the edge of my clouds

Within the scope of what I could hardly perceive in a few moments of clarity I feel you there

Like the lunar moth on the window screen we were born yesterday and we might die tomorrow
Just to save these intangible days that turn into nights in a reckless shift

To untie the knot that restrains us in exchange of the beginning and the end
Three days of torrential rain leaving to a different ground
Loosing signals of your fairyland proves me wrong
