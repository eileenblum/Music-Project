Caught in the maze of a granted wish as your colors restored a slice of my fate

A thousand lonely nights longing for you
And a quarter of a year to erase the doubt

To open up while it closes in
To see if it would make any difference

A season into the chasm of our carelessness
To find out what the future holds

We might be guilty but at least we tried
And wherever life may lead us

Like a river that runs to the sea I will retain those memories
