Since the sun has set
the secline of an epic realm
unable to rearrange the void
that you left behind
That's never to be fulfilled
forced into a renewal of dismal hopes
Frail attempts to resurrect ourselves
to admire the only thing I could not reach
The one we always took for granted
The doors they are closing around me
Every meaningless efforts
Exhausting and bound to fail
To grace the past is all in vain
