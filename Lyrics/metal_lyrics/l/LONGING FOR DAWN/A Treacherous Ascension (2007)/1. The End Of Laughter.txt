Abandoned at the far side of you
Still your spirit hangs over me
to watch for the unattainable
Arms open wide but on my knees
Something went wrong along the way
My fate stares at me
Your curse takes its toll
A lifetime to remember
Whatever that meant
is still means the same
Yet I renounce the irreversible
At dawn I should be gone
There's nowhere to shine
for this fading bliss
