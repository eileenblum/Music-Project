When the trust is lost and gone
the roots of our growing disharmony
at the barricades of the heart
The ever flowing tears of the secluded
We crushed what we conceived
The ruins of a dying legacy
Nothing else was as sweet
You used to lift me up
I remember that ethereal serenity
an Illusive sense of security
In times of disbelief to deteriorate
Beyond this killing loneliness
lying at the gates of indecision
The choose has been made
