Once the world grew cold
The old times, I have forgotten them
My life, it all was sold
When tomb-like night fell over me

Since then no light entered my soul
Only the beast's howl filled the dark
It held me as its living gold
Lonely my lasting being bowed

This message goes to my buried heart:
At one time you were my dearest part
I am longing for thee
For you were taken away from me
Now the only way is to find peace
There's one place left to seek:
The end

But yes, I still have the will to be
To face death like every other man
But then, why won't it let me?
Why can I never see the sun?
