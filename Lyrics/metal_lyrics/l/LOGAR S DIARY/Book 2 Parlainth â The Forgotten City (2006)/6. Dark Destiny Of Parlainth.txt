When the wizards tried to take the city back
They caused an accident and everyone went mad
The new dimension they moved to changed the atmosphere bad
The sky over Parlainth turned from blue to black

Many thousand fairytales
Lighten up this mystic place
All try to convince you
Which one is true?

Suddenly they appeared - demons in the night
Out of dark hide-aways where they'd waited long
Maybe Parlainth had to decay although it prospered strong:
The consequences of isolation caused famine and all died

Hear the dispute of all those tales
They make me mute and listen to them well
