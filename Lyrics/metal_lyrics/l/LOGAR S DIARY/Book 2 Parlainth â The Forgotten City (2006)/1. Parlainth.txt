Once, in a time before the great plague, which forced the people to employ any means to eliviate it, the splendour and the pride of Parlainth were unbroken. 
But evil soon threatened not only Parlainth's wealth and strength; it was its mere existence that was under attack! Was there any way to ward off this horrid fate?

After long consideration, it was decided to make use of the magicians' power: Parlainth was shifted into the astral dimension and torn out of its earthly surroundings. 
By a second spell all memory concerning Parlainth was to be wiped out of mankind's mind...And so it was done.

When Parlainth was rediscovered and its face was once again revealed, it became clear that the magicians had been mistaken: Parlainth returned as a mysterious ruin. 
What was left now of its former glory? 
The secret of the decay remains unknown till today. However, all the horrors, the treasures and the souls of the deceased seem to be still present. 
And at night you can hear them calling you...

There... In the ruins of 'PARLAINTH - THE FORGOTTEN CITY'
