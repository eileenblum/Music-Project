Good day, my friends. You ask for my name?
They call me Celas
You need my hand â the warrior's power!
I'll lend you my strength

Bearer of light â a candle when darkness falls
Freedom shall rise â here is the helping force
When our duty calls

Why do you doubt â you ask for reasons?
I swear I am true
It is my choice to fight against evil
I've given an oath

You hesitate â you ask what I promised?
I cannot tell
But trust in me â give me a chance
To keep my word
