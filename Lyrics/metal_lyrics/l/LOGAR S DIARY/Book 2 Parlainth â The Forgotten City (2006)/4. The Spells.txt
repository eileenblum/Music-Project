Now tomorrow is very unclear
Our lives are very unsafe in these days of fear

Why must we all be fleeing
Why does everything change once it's worth being

These days we must escape in the night
If we want to lose the threatening might

Great magicians from everywhere
Must help us and move Parlainth to another sphere

Mighty spells unite!
Create a thunderstorm by night
You are our only hope
Parlainth must hide

Mighty spells unite!
Create a thunderstorm by night
You are our only hope
Parlainth must hide

So now we can't be found anymore
But what will those people conclude that have known us before

Again will those magic spells blaze,
Wipe out the memory of this holy place

Ch. Mighty spells are tied
Now we remain alone in the night
This was our only hope
Parlainth is hiding now
