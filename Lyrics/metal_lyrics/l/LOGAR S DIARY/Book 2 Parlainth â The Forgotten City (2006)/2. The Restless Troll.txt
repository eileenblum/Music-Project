At night you roam through Heaven, heading for Parlainth
You seek information of the lost city
There is only one place where you might succeed
Near the gate to mystery you'll find what you need

Welcome to the Restless Troll
Join us and drink to soothe your pain
Hear and feel the stories
Dancing through the air

As you pass the entrance the room is watching you
All these unseen strangers face you with their looks
Nervous and bewildered you close and leave the door
All draw their attention back to where it was before

Go right to the counter, get yourself a drink
Dive into the crowd, try to get a seat
Open ears and eyes, absorb the mood around
With this procedure treasures can be found
