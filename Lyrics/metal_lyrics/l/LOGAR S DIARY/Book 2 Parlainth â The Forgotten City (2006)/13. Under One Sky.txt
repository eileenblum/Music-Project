Out in the furthest lands beyond
Where fantasy is the creator of life
I see people and races dwell
They're rising and growing in harmony

We live under one sky,
Sharing only this one world
We must realise it's time
That all belong as one

Don't wait any longer
Till injustice takes control
Let us show our will to the ones
That fight humanity

Here I find people driven by hate
Offending minorities, judging too fast
Help us to stop them before it's too late
Their deeds and our deeds become the same past

We live our lives in two different worlds:
A dreamworld and a reality
I would prefer the second of these two
If only this single dream came true

We live under one sky,
Sharing only this one world
Realise that all are one!

Don't wait any longer
Till injustice takes control
Let us show our will right now!
