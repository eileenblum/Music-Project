Once the world was split and broken
Now it is whole again

That night a lost piece reappeared
Its face revealed itself distorted and deformed

We see our past lost and betrayed
Since mystery revealed its cursed fate

Deep confusion spreads among us
As we see the relics of pain

Will we ever discover their doom
If history has fled from this dark place

Hope remains â we keep on trying
Our will is strong to lighten the dark

Someone will one time open the door,
Uncover the look of the hidden one
