"After a while we discovered the Kaer. Many frightening creatures were waiting there for us, 
but we fought with courage and finally found the diary in the heart of the Kaer. It was 
guarded by a huge abominable demon. Although I was afraid of Axandria getting hurt we 
fought with our last powers and defeated the monster. I'll never forget this demon in the 
Kaer..."

There it is - a cave in the ground
Weed is growing out
Seeds of hate are sowed
Death pollutes the air
Dying illusions he must inhabit that Kaer

Dark - dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer

Dark - dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer

Fighting through the hordes of their master
A voice says
Come near faster
Now I feel his unholy breath
Ti'An my friend was tortured till death

Dark - dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer

Dark - dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer
