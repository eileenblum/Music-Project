"During our journey we met the ghost of a Windling. It seemed as if Ti'An had waited for us. 
He told us about the danger Barsaive should be aware of. Evil is trying to destroy our world. 
In order to fight the darkness we should find the Windling's diary, deep in a dungeon. This 
told us Ti'An the troubadour..."

My name is Ti'An - I was a troubadour
Listen closely - I'm telling you what I've died for

Ti'An the Troubadour
A well-hearted man plays no more
His sweet voice fading away
Deep in our hearts - a place to stay

The beasts from Thera have forged an evil plan
To oppress Barsaive and enslave every man

Ti'An the Troubadour
A well-hearted man plays no more
His sweet voice fading away
Deep in our hearts - a place to stay

Hush my friends - it's time - I'm leaving you
Get my book - everything is said - I'll guide you through

Ti'An the Troubadour
A well-hearted man plays no more
His sweet voice fading away
Deep in our hearts - a place to stay
