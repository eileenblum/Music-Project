"It was a dreadful fight but we were victorious once again. But the joy of victory was spoilt 
by the conversation I had with Axandria afterwards. Although we both admitted to love each 
other, we agreed to walk separated ways because we were too different for each other. It 
nearly broke my heart, because my love still exists..."

Now you will see - sadness overwhelms me
Nothing more left to live or to be

Even when you're gone
You will live deep in me
My love still exists
And the wind tells your name

Even when you're gone
The distance is less far
My love still exists
Axandria
I'll miss you
I'll be with you
Forever

How shall I carry on with such a pain inside
Roaming under this wicked sky

Now you will leave - my love will always follow you
Believe me - I know that you do

Even when you're gone
You will live deep in me
My love still exists
And the wind tells your name

Even when you're gone
The distance is less far
My love still exists
Axandria
I'll miss you
I'll be with you
Forever
