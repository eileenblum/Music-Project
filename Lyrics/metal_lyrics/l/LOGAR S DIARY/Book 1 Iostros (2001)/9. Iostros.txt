"The king allowed us to collaborate with his secret service. With the information provided by 
them we discovered that the magician behind the evil plan was a man from Thera called 
Iostros. He was one of the most popular traders in Barterstown, leading a life disguised as a 
trader but conspiring against humanity. Time was urging and we headed to Iostros..."

There's someone who's despising mankind
There's someone here preaching the dark
But no one cares - they're all so blind
Seeking justice we will set a mark

Magic surrounds us

Now that your time has come
Justice is done
We're sent by the light
To turn the black back to white

Don't hail the wrong
Together we're strong
Soon you'll burn
And then the tides will turn

Revenge for all the lives you took
Now faith is coming over you
All your crimes realized by one look
You're guilty - justice will come true

Magic surrounds us

Now that your time has come
Justice is done
We're sent by the light
To turn the black back to white

Don't hail the wrong
Together we're strong
Soon you'll burn
And then the tides will turn

When the dance begins
Magic flows through thee
We feel our bones breaking
But our strength sets us free

Feel the power - taste the steel
Our agony is what you feel
You turn away in hate
Cowardly fleeing through the gate

Now that your time has come
Justice is done
We're sent by the light
To turn the black back to white

Don't hail the wrong
Together we're strong
Soon you'll burn
And then the tides will turn
