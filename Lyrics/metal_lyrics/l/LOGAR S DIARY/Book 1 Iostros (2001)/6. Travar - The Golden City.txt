"The diary told us about an evil plan of oppressing Barsaive. A necromancer from Thera had 
a deal with some demons; so he achieved great powers and the ability to destroy Barsaive. 
In the book we discovered the hint to go to Travar and to find that bard who needs to be 
informed. Afterwards we should visit the king in Throal and report what is going on. So we 
set out for Travar, the golden city..."

Looking from the Serpent - you can see a town
Here's nothing left of madness - day has wiped out dawn
Gold instead of darkness is shining all around
In protecting walls a healthy mankind can be found

Golden city - Travar is its name
In the dark hours in here they came
Bringing death and fear with them inside
Many more were killed in their chanceless fight

But still the sun rises and falls
It's a wall of life again in terrific halls
In peoples' hearts burning a glorious flame
In the city of gold - Travar is its name

I reached the gate - paid and walked in
Rush around - I must find him
The book is the key - the end is written
The bard must help me - time is fadin'

Golden city - Travar it is called
Unholy demons came and made a cruel assault
In this bloody fight many lost their lives
The nights were filled with broken people's cries

Now freedom has returned again
It's warmer and brighter than it was then
Hope has come back - now it will stay
In the city of gold justice has found its way

Finally the elfin bard is telling tales at the bar
As I enter the House of the Sun in golden Travar

Golden city - Travar is its name
In the dark hours in here they came
Bringing death and fear with them inside
Many more were killed in their chanceless fight

But still the sun rises and falls
It's a wall of life again in terrific halls
In peoples' hearts burning a glorious flame
In the city of gold - Travar is its name
