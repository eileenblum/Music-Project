"After arriving in Throal, leaving Barterstown behind, we managed to get an audience with 
the king. As a proof handed over the Windling's diary. I still can't believe talking to the ruler 
of Throal in the King's hall..."

The mountains of Throal are his home
He's the one who reigns
The one who wears the crown

The mighty palace built of stone
We have to bring the book
So let's get to the throne

Hail and glory to you - freedom you will bring
Together standing tall in the hall of the king

Banners hanging off the wall
With strongly beating hearts
We enter the King's hall

There you are our mighty king
In honour we kneel down
To the ruler of everything

Hail and glory to you - freedom you will bring
Together standing tall in the hall of the king

"Now leave me - the passions are with you
Saviours of the land
You all know what to do

The kingdom is right behind your back
Bring it to an end
And break Iostros' neck"

Hail and glory to you - freedom you will bring
Together standing tall in the hall of the king
