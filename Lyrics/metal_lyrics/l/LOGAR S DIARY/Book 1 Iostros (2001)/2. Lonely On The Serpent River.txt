"We - my friend S'kirrel and me - were sailing on our ship on the back of the Serpent River, 
the biggest river in Barsaive. Suddenly we discovered a body drifting in the river. As we 
came closer, I noticed that this was by far the loveliest elf I had ever seen. My heart stood 
still for a moment as I became aware that the girl was unconscious - and I thought hearing 
the Serpent River sing..."

My head reaches the Blood Woods - the tail reaches Travar
The distance is far
And my arms like veins - are spreading through the land
The Death's Sea lies at my end

I'm crossing the mountains - I'm entering the sea
Lively and free
I'm the serpent - wild and quiet
People pay tribute or feel my might

Helplessly you're floating - darkest destiny
Is ruling thee
But your saviours - they're not far away
Hold on - still you have to stay

Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely on the raging stream
Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely Elf, you're embraced by me

Now they've reached you
A T'skrang and a man
Finally they saved you
And gave you hope again

Now that I lost thee - I take on my way
As every day
I'm the serpent - creeping trought the land
The Death's Sea lies at my end

Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely on the raging stream
Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely Elf, you're embraced by me
