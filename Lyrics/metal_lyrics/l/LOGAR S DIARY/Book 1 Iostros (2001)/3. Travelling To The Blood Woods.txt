"After coming back to life Axandria told us about her order of delivering an urgent message 
to the elfin queen living in the Blood Woods. I simply couldn't resist her beautiful pleading 
eyes, so we promised Axandria to accompany her, travelling to the Blood Woods..."

Dawn has come - soon we will be gone
We face the Blood Woods - the work has to be done
The sun is rising - the jungle's deep
Believing in our hopes that we keep

Sitting on her throne made of wood and of blood ruleth the queen
Wither like a rose - skin having thorns of pain - despairing scream

Where we will go no one returns - a place where sorrow dwells
Years of self mutilation - rejected by all - all beauty is gone

Passing darkness getting into light
Frightening corpses are entering our sight
Through he seemed but he opened his eyes
Boiling panic let the murder rise

Sitting on her throne made of wood and of blood ruleth the queen
Wither like a rose - skin having thorns of pain - despairing scream

Where we will go no one returns - a place where sorrow dwells
Years of self mutilation - rejected by all - all beauty is gone

Then we meet you my friend
Blood-brothers until the end
The oath holds us together
Farewell my friend - forever

Where we will go no one returns - a place where sorrow dwells
Years of self mutilation - rejected by all - all beauty is gone
