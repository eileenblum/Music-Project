"Now many years have passed. I'm sitting at a waterfall and think of the adventures I 
experienced. I remember S'kirrel and of course Axandria who left a hole in my heart. 
Somehow I miss the old times. And so I'm resting here, thinking back of our quest and 
remember all m emotions...! By the way, I met Axandria again, but that is another story."
