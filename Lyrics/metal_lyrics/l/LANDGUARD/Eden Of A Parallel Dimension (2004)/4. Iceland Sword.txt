Everything loses its light
In the rage of time
Blood and steel sign in the sky
Another chapter of life
Pray your god, IÂ´ll pray my mind
Loosing the way of light
And my arms break the gates
For another triumph
Down the legendary skies
I will fight for freedom
The lord of wisdom couldnÂ´t decide of my life
In a kingdom without throne
When the power will be blood
For the glory I must fight
With the Iceland sword

In a secret time... Iceland sword
I will fight the light... For my life
With a secret pray... Iceland sword
IÂ´ll destroy my fate... For my life

Everytime I loose control
I scream against the sky
In the cradle of the war
I awake the seeds of rage
From the red to black of the night
I meet the reality
Of the absurd, of the cry
Of the Iceland shine
Nothing will break my desire
Come with me wherever I find
My lost crown, my forgotten sword
In the air smell of fear
Take the rain, tears from the sky
Meet the fate, burn your soul
Wherever I go, there will be
Another cage, another kingdom in flames
