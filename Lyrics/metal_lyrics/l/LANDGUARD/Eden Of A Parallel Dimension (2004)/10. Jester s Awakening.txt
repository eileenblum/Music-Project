[1) Again the rain]

Another end for another day before reality
Will lie the truths of time
When silence will tell your name
Through the freezing wind of time...
But it rains again
IÂ´m steeping out of a closed door, another reality
IÂ´ve found another piece of mind
The ghosts of silence will close my eyes
While I play a melody
ItÂ´s a fuge... on the ivory keys
Give me a damned kiss, fairy without sin
Play with my emotions
Drive me through perversions
IÂ´m looking at the rain
JesterÂ´s awakening
Beyond the end of the day
Mirrors and labyrinths
IÂ´m looking at the rain
JesterÂ´s awakening
IÂ´m writing the fate
I crawl in the mud
Frames of reality
This is a lost reflection
Mirror of my emotions

[2) Waltz of shadows]

The wizard of time begin the waltz of shadows
I steal his key and open the door
So day and night collide and then born a new day
Symphonies begin a waltz in the sky

[3) Garden of illusions]

Break the silence with a smile and draw your passion in my eyes
When the sunrise will be far away
Listen to the rain that wash their Eden
Look at the rainbow through my eyes
I will be the secret in your life
Break the mirror, erase your shadows so the past will not return
If you want you can feel the night breeze
Coming out of the garden of illusions
Welcome to the reality
If you want you can hear my symphony
I lost in the time
I will return to break the silence...
... To live a new day
So this will be my life
Inside your eyes to break the silence...
... To live a new day
