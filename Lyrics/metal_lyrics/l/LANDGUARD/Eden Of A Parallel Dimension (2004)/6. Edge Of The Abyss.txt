IÂ´ll try to survive in this night
Storm cold symphony of bloody rain
IÂ´ll believe, IÂ´ll take my name
On the manuscript, in the battlecry
Nothing all I know, the sorrow take away from my mind
Into another cage
In the madness, without reason scream and cry
Evil sorcerers, fatal attraction of two mind...
Fight and survive
Kingdom of fire, of desire burn in my hands
Kingdom of fire, bright and dire burn in flames
In the silence of the black wood I will disappear
While sorrow will write its tale
Near the edge of abyss IÂ´ll erase my religion
IÂ´ll destroy my Iceland sword
my... frozen soul
