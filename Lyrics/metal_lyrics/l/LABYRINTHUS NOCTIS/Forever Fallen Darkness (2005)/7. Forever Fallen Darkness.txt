Crying dawn with dying leaves
Autumn passed stoling your smile
Lying together in this mortuary bed
We tried in vain to frost the time

"Rest in peace my little bride
The sun will never rise again
Take my hand and sink with me
One last time in this bed of pain"

Through the walls of our love
Moving down a sickly stream
Sadness arrived from barren lands
An inner fog obscured our own dream

Close to you I see your arid grace
No tear flowed on your pale face
Lost in the mood of dark presages
With ghosts behind I roam alone

But once we owed eternal love
And the promise is engraved in stone
Here's the castle where I enchained my heart
And now these towers dissolve in my arms

Flying away like ashes in the wind
But I won't be a solitary queen
Since the day you dried my inward creed
I've been building a new different dream
I choose my sins I want to fall again
Feel the ground violated by the rain
