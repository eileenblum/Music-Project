See the sky
A world of ice
Infinity
So pure and deep
So your eyes
Shining bright
Stir up my skin
I can't retreat

Sharp is a dagger your glances pierce my heart
And I shut the light 'cause I know you come at night
But I can't percieve if you're just another dream
Deceit that wets my sheets and my pink delight

I swallow your magic elixir tonight
Your poison betrays my senses, I'm slowly dying
I refuse the antidote but I need a cure
Will your steel needle inject love in my wound

See the sky
A world of ice
Infinity
So pure and deep
So your eyes
Seem so shy
But you can't see
My greedy humid lips

Flash in the dark, you blind all my desire
Thunder in the storm your creature now arises
Heat in my bed his hold inflames my skin
In my room this chaos becomes your silent greed

Flying with your dragon, I tame another land
You crown me as the lascivious princess of your reign
Then I give rest to the dragon in my den
But I feel it's not sleeping it's pulsing in my cave

I was not dreaming when I heard you say:
- "Be free and let time
Write your own diary
Don't waste your life
Moments are eternity
I'm here to love
And teach you to fly".
I will enjoy
The bleak show of this theatre of lies

See the sky
A world of ice
Infinity
So pure and deep
Just disguise
Sudden tide
You dig apart
So slyly
Slyly...

Ghost in the dark
You penetrate my sleep
And I shiver as your spirit
Enter into me
