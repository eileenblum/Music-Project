God rape me and give me heart
To cross alone this unknown path
Shall I join the dawn over this dusky stream
Lost in the sidereal space of your untouchable reign
Of neverending coloumnades and silent temples of pain

You're floating through memories of my dismay
God light another spark
Please create another star
If I blow out the candlelight with my tears
Lost in the sidereal space of your untouchable reign
Of neverending coloumnades and silent temples of pain

I'm lieing
Close to your blood and my last sin
Just to feel your dying embrace on me...
Now that all is dark and the vaults without stars
And my guilt is reflecting in your bleak eyes
Everything is lost now but your heart to embalm
Just to hear your whispers calling me...
Till I lose my way among these trees
And the tempest brings a mourning wind

A ghostly voice surrounded all my grief
I woke up in a cemetery of dreams
Do my lament cover your last breath?
Or can my conscience achieve
To bury your flame and then forsake?
Is my courage just a blinded hate?
Is this knife my bloody shame?
The choice to stop your pain
I'm a gipsy shape
Among deserted graves
