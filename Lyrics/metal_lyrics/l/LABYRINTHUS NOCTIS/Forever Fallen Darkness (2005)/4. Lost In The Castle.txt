The sense of the universe
In the course of a star
The key of my deep rest
Is the dream that you are
The life of a flower
Is the caress of the wind
But I can't fly higher
If you clip my wings

The death of a love
Is the cry of a heart
Are you forever gone?
And I feel only smart

The sea that I must cross
Is the tears that you shed
Can a light in the frost
Rescue my ship from the pit?
The flash of a distant light
Is a certainty in my darkest night
The colour of your dreams
Is the sky in my memories

The castle where I am lost
Is the labyrinth of your soul
But I'll find the secret door
To free your enchanted ghost
And I'm here once again
To take shelter from the rain
And walk through these spiderwebs

Dream of you in our empty bed
And I'm here once again
To take shelter from the rain
And walk through these spiderwebs
Lay a flower on your grave
