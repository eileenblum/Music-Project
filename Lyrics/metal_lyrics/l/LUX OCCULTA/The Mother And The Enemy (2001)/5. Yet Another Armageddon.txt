This is the first day of our last days
This is the first day of our last days
No one cares, no one cares anymore

Itâs so tempting to have faith
Itâs so hard to pretend
A new simpler theology
Eternity in a piece of meat

This is the first day of our last days
This is the first day of our last days
But no one cares, no one cares anymore
We overslept another Armageddon
A new simpler theology
A new simpler theology
No one cares, no one cares anymore...
