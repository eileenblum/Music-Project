Beautiful and wealthy is our town of Hamelin
Neighbors are green with envy, proud my fellow citizens
Our stomachâs are full, our dreams are calm
We can either kill or buy all that comes our way

Please your honors â said he â Iâm able
By means of a secret charm, to draw
All creatures living beneath the sun
That creep or swim or fly or run
After me so as you never saw!
And I chiefly use my charm
On creatures that do people harm
The mole and toad and newt and viper
And people call me the pied piper

But thereâs this small embarrassing thing
Filthy, disgusting, stinking rats
They donât belong here
They donât match
Did almighty lord create the scum?

You can have your perfect world
But you will have to pay the price

âCause thereâs the small, embarrassing thing
Filthy, disgusting, stinking us
We donât belong here
We donât match
Your father in heavens didnât create us

Pay your bills fellow citizens
Or we will take your children with us
Itâs not about hatred, weâre not your enemies
But you see, we have to feed the rats

And you will never learn
Whoâs the hunter and whoâs prey in this game
And you will never learn
Who is Pied Piper and whoâs rat in the end
And you will never learn
Who is the leader and whoâs been lead
