White headed wisemen decipher your scars
Trying to read between the layers
Hold me tight, break my spine
Put me back into Hell of your womb
Let me suck your festering wounds
Iâll grow strong on pus and blood

For I am the first and the last
I am the honored one and the scorned one
I am the whore and the holy one
I am the wife and the virgin
I am the mother and the daughter
I am the members of my mother

The crown and the scepter of living cells
Pitiful regalia
âLove surrounds us allâ
Thus spoke her dead majesty

I am she whose wedding is great
And I have not taken a husband
I am the midwife and she who does not bear
I am the solace of my labor pains
I am the bride and the bridegroom
And it is my husband who begot me
I am the mother of my father and the sister of my husband
And he is my offspring

Selfish bitch, mother paranoia
Cannot live without your poisonous milk
Cannot live without your lethal caress

Life is a cancer
Unnatural state
Kiss me, cure me
Mother death
