Natural order of things
The first lie and farewell kiss
Homo sum et nihil humanum
Nylon, plastic uranium, plutonium

Breathe in
Breathe out

In the basilica of the human body
Obey the law of flesh ever burning
Ten commandments of oxygen and carbon
Entombed in a pyramid of skin
Communicating vessels, acid, electricity
What a useless mechanism

Behind the walls of protein prison
Crowned with barbed wire of DNA
Imprisoned is this piece of shit

Are we indeed fingerprints of God?
Zero one zero zero oneâ¦
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
One one zero one zero oneâ¦

A human being
What a shame
I think therefore I am
What a waste
