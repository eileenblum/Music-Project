This the last hour of the carnival
I dance, I dance though it hurts
Hangmanâs rope suits well
Every gentleman
Madam, you look charming
In the necklace of blood

People say thereâs a day after
Every night
People say thereâs sun
Behind these clouds
What a relief
Iâll drink to that
Pour me a glass of poisoned wine

Thanks to merineth for correcting tracks ## 5, 10 lyrics.
