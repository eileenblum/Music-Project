Itâs immoral to have one eye
In the kingdom of the blind
Yet I believe that all in this world
Is the manifestation of God

I grow rusty nails in my wounds
I bathe them with my urine
They will blossom with blood
But they will never fructify
I breed this noble wine
On black soil Ge-Hinnom
What a lovely place to die
Home sweet home
I bake my bitter bread
In this crematory oven
I use human ashes as flour
And so big the dough grows

I know where I belong
And I know where to go
Iâve seen that episode on TV
Iâve seen it twice
I put the barrel in my mouth
That brings back peace of mind
Itâs so much fun to play Russian roulette
With a fully loaded gun

This is the point when it starts
This is the point when it ends

I own all maps of human weakness
I have all keys to deprivation
Call me by my countless names
Emptiness, confusion, despair
Satan tempting himself
The serpent swallowing its tail
Call me perfect, call me nine
Sins donât leave scars
Call me hell
