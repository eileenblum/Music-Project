I didnât start this wicked game
Neither were the rules of play mine
You invited me to the chessboard
Your pieces are white?
Fine Iâll take black...

Clever and cruel opening
King sacrifices his baby son
White knights move decidedly
Strange are the ways of black goats

Send your messengers up North
They will bring you coldness and doubt
Send your messengers down south
They will bring you decay and distrust
Send your messengers to the west
They will bring discouragement and disappointment
Send your messengers to the east
They will bring torment and pain

Time for the next move
You have your last eternity
Flag fall
Heads fall
Itâs my turn

I fucked the queen
And she enjoyed the ride
I cursed your bishop
I impaled your knights

Checkmated God
Face to face with a free pawn
