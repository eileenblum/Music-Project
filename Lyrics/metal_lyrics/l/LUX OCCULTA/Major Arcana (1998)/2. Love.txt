Her name was Water
Fire was His name
you can still walk their traces
in the forest of delights
two first lovers ever
Heaven-She &amp; He-Hell
two so different elements
caught in equilibrium

yes, yes, touch gently my skin
let the blood boil in your heart, in your veins
dance with me
dance on me
let me show you how do I look inside

O, mightiest Queen
wearing crown of roses
give me the blessings
with your sacred fruit of love
O, mightiest Queen
to thee I bow
I am the servant
of your nakedness

Love is the Law
Love is for the Strong
Warriors - if you can see my Naked Sword
Kings - don?t we all have the Throne of Dreams
Angels - can?t you see the shadow of my Wings expended ?
