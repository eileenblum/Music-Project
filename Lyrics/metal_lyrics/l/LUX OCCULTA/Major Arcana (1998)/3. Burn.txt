Oh smoke, sweet smoke around
the sky turns black covering eye of sun
riding the demon of wrath
I bring the fire
I am revenge
the heart of the storm
what a beautiful landscapes around
that ruby glares
in the spilled wine
(or is it a blood? their blood?)
the night is so bright
as the stars have fallen down

oh smoke, more smoke around
inferno crawled upon the earth
yeah, it must be the hell itself
i was the one who has shown them the way
from splendor to ashes
from might to dust

he cannot hide now
the war has begun
