deserted... forsaken... abandoned...

where is the promised land?
where is the eden you told me about?
where emotions that once seized my heart?
where are your warm, helpful hands?

yeah... now i see... you are all dead
dead for me

abandoned by friends i've never really had
this is the price we pay for being ourselves
solitude and sorrow for choosing my own way
these are my gardens of sweetest pain

now i swallow my bitter tears
i kill the pain that poisoned my heart
now i piss on your graves

i dance alone
my hateful dance of victory
stronger than ever
forever alone... immortal...
