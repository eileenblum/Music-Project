from the seven hundred seventy and seven whores
we were born here, within the realm of the blind
with your knees sticked to the soil
rain washed our shoulders
we used to eat worms and dirt
confused, crippled, inhuman we are
the children of the never-life
from poisoned seed of impotant gods
the legion of angels with faces of dogs

now i awake my inner might
rooted down in my divine will

now i can see the road to the throne
i pull the strings, my kingdom is infinite
blind headless gods cowardly hide
blind armless gods cowardly hide
blind soulless gods cowardly hide

the awakening has begun...
