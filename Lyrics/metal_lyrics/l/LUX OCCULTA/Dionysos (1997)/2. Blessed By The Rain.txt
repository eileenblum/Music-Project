Only the old ones remember
the night of the holy rain
the Earth flowed with milk
flowed with blood-red wine
flowed with the nectar of bees

Only the old ones remember
the night that became a day
when in the glare of bursting forms
the god had become a man
breaking the cosmis chains

Only the old ones remember
the storm that turned worms into eagles
the storm that woke us up

that was the day when the heavens crashed
we fell on our knees, skies fell on our heads
gods have appeared in flesh

invisible drums and pipes announced his triumphant arrival
lustful satyrs, raging bulls guide his shiny litter
women that hunger for life open wide their tender treasuries
heavenly terror, holy grace,
the Aeon of Light came into the world

and the generations rose
thousands by thousands
with their wings and horns
imperceptible
