Silent barocco of shredded light
coils of rays plaited together
with chains of flesh
such a calm morning...
and the earth's crust explodes
with the carpet  of thousand flowers
music of all spheres
...He is back!

aroused women wash their naked bodies
in bubbling springs of sweet dark wine
the whole world will dance in this joyful time
everything blossoms, even the stones sing dithyrambs

His golden hair streams in the wind
as he dances with the nymphs
Be thou our king! Be thou our king!

maenads - his hunting dogs - are now unleashed
frenzied women devvour their crying children
phalli carved out of stone plough cold dead wombs
Hail Zagreus! Hail Bromios! Let the Great Hunt begin...

His golden hair streams in the wind
as he spills the blood of his enemies
Be thou our king! Be thou our king!

Delight of Mortals, The One Who Breaks the Chains
Gloria!!!
God of Many Joys, Giver of Wine
Gloria!!!
Lord of Souls, Eater of Raw Flesh
Gloria!!!
The One Who Chages his Forms
Gloria!!!
The One Who Delights in Sword and Bloodshed
Gloria!!!
Prince of Daylight and the Underworld Darkness
Gloria!!!
