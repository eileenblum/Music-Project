'Come, and be revealed a bull, my Raging One!
Be a many-headed dragon!
Be a lion, spuring flames!
Come!'
[taken from 'Bakkhai' by Euripides]

...and the time has come
to fulfil the oath
hold your swords tight
aim the sun

spread proudly your wings
this is the day to transgress the forbidden
spread proudly your wings
can't you see them?

armour made of dream
wrath is my untiring steed
humilation is my arm
we shall bloody our fists
on these clouds made of steel
but we fail, everything fails

Lead us, Raging One, upwards!
Share your madness with us...
Upwards to conquer heaven!
Upwards to seize the throne!
