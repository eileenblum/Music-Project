With this ring I thee wed
with two-cleft tongue I baptize thy flesh

in this wine I wash the dirt
off my angel wings
wedding poles once opposite
purest alchemy

riding golden lizards
wearing human meat
crowned three times with Three
she joined my dream
inseminating her thousand wombs
with burning drops of liquid light
giving life to new
Circles Orbits Spheres
Monads Objects Souls

with this blade I shall teach you
perfidious luxury of love
in this dance I surrender to the Might
Fertility Divine

the passion fades away
as the dagger melts in her holy wound
I'm getting closer and closer
white sore sun swallows the dark

the beginning is the end
we are separated again
like a walnut chopped in half
