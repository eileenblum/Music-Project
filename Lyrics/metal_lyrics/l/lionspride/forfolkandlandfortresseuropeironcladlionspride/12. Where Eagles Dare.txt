Until death
With their last breath

Into glory ride
Side by side they fell
As if they only died
To re-group in hell
Onward into battle
For honour, pride and land
Their young blood spilled
In a dramatic last stand

Where eagles dare

Until death
Until their last breath

Famous their discipline
Feared by all
No retreat, never give in
Legions standing tall
A heroes' rise and fall
Gods of war they were
Answering Europe's call
Where eagles dare

Where eagles dare
