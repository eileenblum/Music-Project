Siren of souls
Howling and piercing the night.
These are the streets,
Clinic fingertips.
Sex and Violence.

A naked soul,
Smashed apart.
Yearning, searching, longing.
There are the street,
I call my home.

A light pressure,
Reality dissolves,
I am shattered
Light, streams, energy
My ground is shifting
A mosaic of senses.

Matter is running through my fingers,
Time is laughing at me.
This is the world.
Pulse. Surreal.
