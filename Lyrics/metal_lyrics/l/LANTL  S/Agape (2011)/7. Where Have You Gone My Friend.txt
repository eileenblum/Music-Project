[Bonus CD Track][originally by Asylum Party]thank you, my lord, thank you for all the timeÂ 
you had to be in my life for all this years
after all, I've just began to like this life
tonight you pull me back to your side
where have you gone my friend
you have to take my hand
where have you gone, where have you gone
