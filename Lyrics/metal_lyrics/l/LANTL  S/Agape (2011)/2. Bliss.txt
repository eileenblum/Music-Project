Within my stomach there is a hole
In which my dreams dwell
On the highest plateau
Under the tree having blossoms of light

My dreams are hands
Grabbing the nothingness

And their mouths
Consume the world
My skin feels rusty
And I cry tears of acid

My skin feels rusty
And I cry tears of acid

When I moan to the cryptic winds
The sky is absolute and always
Omega
