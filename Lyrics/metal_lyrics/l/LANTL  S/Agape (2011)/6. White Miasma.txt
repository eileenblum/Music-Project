[Bonus CD Track]my bliss, the injection
my love, sterile
liquid steel replaces warm blood
as I leaped the edge.

Give away your body
to the razorhands
Scars of caress
Mechanical disensoulment

voluptuous,
flexuous flesh
tasting ecstacy
pale and cold hands 

Your womb is my white miasma,
Release yourself
Turn off your mind
love me.
