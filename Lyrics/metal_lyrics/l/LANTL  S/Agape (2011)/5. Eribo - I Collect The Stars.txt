I collect the light from the stars
When I close my crippled fingers
And when I draft my emaciated back
Confined in my gazebo of crystal,
It only shines for you

Come by, my father, look
Come and see my fall
For I collected all the light

Come by, my father, look
Come and see my fall
For I collected all the light

I tear of my skin and bow to thee humbly
Take my tongue, so you can always hear my worries
Take my ears, so I can hear your solace
