[La Poignante Ballade d'une AÃ¯eule en Eaux Troubles]

Hello, you can call me old shell,
I came yesterday and Iâm not here to stay,
Itâs a long way, but Iâm not alone,
With me the ghost of my forty grandsons.

I follow the ocean flow,
I follow the tears and the infinite fear,
My day is coming, Walrus should be quaking,
With me the ghost of his forty victims.

The beast immobile stands in front of me,
His flippers nailed on a wooden cross,
A funny beam stuck in his mouth,
God, he looks dumb.

Iâve been stolen my victim
Iâm still in mourning
The ghosts, my children,
Still lost, my childrenâ¦

My children ! My children !
My children ! My children !
This is not enoughâ¦
"Are you my mummy?"

Oyster grandma, take your doll
Say the words, make him live
Again! Suffer more!
Come, again! Live, again!

"Mummy? Mummy?"
Hear us, forever, our voices, our souls
Around you, inside you
Forever hear us
You can't die, never
Live again, stay forever

You will never escape anymore !
You will never live anymore !
You will never die anymore !
You will never die anymore !

Weâre ghosts in the shells around your neckâ¦
