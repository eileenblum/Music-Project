[Therapy for the Unanimated and the Headless]

Much dark, very silence
Such still, many peaceful Wow !

Hiding in this old blue box
He could never find me again
I'm tired, I'm drenched
In fear, in sweat
(We donât sweat, moronâ¦)
Oh no, there's steps

It's back, its feet stomping the ground
Light's overflowing, blinding my sight
Its grasp takes my breath away
(â¦and we donât breathe)
My head starts to spin
But, like, for real

A red nose
A cream pie
This is time for you to die/smile
Some balloons
And big shoes
It seems I am it right now

GET OFF ME
(They all float down here)
LEAVE ME BE

(What am I?
What am I?
What am I this time?)

It's back, its feet stomping the ground
Light's overflowing, blinding my sight
Its grasp takes my breath away
My head starts to spin
What am I this time?

(What am I?
What am I?
What am I?
What?)

Why did this blue bitch bring me to life ?
She didn't even finish her fracking job
It's alive if it grows, it breathes, it eats
All I can do is think about the serenity she robbed

I'm a four-legged jolly lad
I'm rainbow-dressed, I'm horned -- that's pretty rad !
The grassland opened to me
The sky maybe, butâ¦
(You still got arms you know ?)

I remember when I was a viking
My daily routine was freedom and drinking
OK it did last only one hour
Will I ever get to live it some more ?
NO !

Too many spins, I'm gonna throw up
(Nope, no stomach)
What am I this... WHAT THE F-

Nuts ! Nuts !! Nuts !!! Nuts !!!!
I've got an unquenchable urge to get some-
-Spaaaaaace ! Spaaaaaace !
I found the one place where
I must be-
-Nuts ! Nuts ! It keeps on eluding me
But I'm not one to give up-
-Spaaaace ! Without a spaceship
Lacks paaaaaace
LEAVE ME IN PEACE

That's it ! A spaceship !
I need a spaceship !
I CRAVE FOR A SPACESHIP !

Why did this blue bitch bring me to life ?
She didn't even finish her fracking job
But it's all right now I've got a way out
I'm gonna retrieve the serenity she robbed

I know who you are...
We know who I am

In a white bottle smelling weird
An ounce of this, a bounce of that (licence poÃ©tique),
The magic sauce, shaken, not stirred
If it can fly, I'll chew a hat

Powered by the mixture
The atoms' fusion has begun
Inside the bottle once empty
Consciousness arises

In a spurt of life, it bounces
I'm ejected, I fly, I fall
Crap, not this sandbox again
