Somehow I knew it would come to this an emperor without clothes your still
clinging to a stitch are you calling yourself caesar yet? caught green 
handed in the middle of
the mess a crippled body guard a shield that's made of silk can this be the 
coming of the end
oh yes I see that rome is burning an empire left to rubble and a smile in 
the crowd
