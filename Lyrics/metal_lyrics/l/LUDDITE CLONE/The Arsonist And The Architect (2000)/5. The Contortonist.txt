Pulled apart I'm the wish bone but if I scream I'll do it with my mouth shut 
tear at the eyes of the
scarecrow to see his stitched eyes wince his won't mine will you think I'm 
going to bleed for you
you'd be surprised you'd be surprised I guess I wanted this I got my wish I 
guess I asked for this
I guess I got my wish
