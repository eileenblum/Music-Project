We are an experiment programmable shells lab at breeders hold the water
bottle humans push the pellets three miles with the turning signal on we are 
looking for our
tails riding on the track of the circle template running on the wheel with 
heaven on the
horizon we are all programmable shells we are an experiment such an 
intricate maze
comprised of a simple mind begging for the needle to inoculate the virus and 
eliminate the
doldrums will you kiss the scientist or eliminate the spectacle
