When the teeth can hold back the gears when the stitches are all that hold 
the scars together and the
lakes dry up like deserts is that when I will have my way when there is 
nothing left to savour
I am sure that's how we'll be petty to the last drop broken to the last 
breath damned till I fold
into quarters
