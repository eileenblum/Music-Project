On set of torment
This is what I call terror
No faith, no ideals, emptiness of life
Waste of time

A blind running just to buy the grave
This is the present malediction
And so you follow the leader that lied
Under the sign of the cross the spell is cast
Live in fear: the call of Lahmia rises!

Damnation takes you to a living nightmare
Die with fear, hallowed be thy name
How can you believe in this rotten failed system?
A corpse without will
If this road leads to heaven

Please drag me to hell
Where's your salvation?
Drag me to hell, to never come back, drag me to hell!

It's time to wake up and to understand
It's not a dream, there's no time to lose
Society's going mad,
Too much time had been wasted in vain, in prayers
This is insane: no one will save you

All I see is sad, dead and gone!

Hypocrisy, mass hysteria and doubt
Is this the order you're looking for?
No one understands and the plague spreads, like a cancer
This is the collective solitude that leads the souls to their God
From a distance I watch your tragedyâ¦ your toxic paradise
Rest In Peace.

Drag me to hell
