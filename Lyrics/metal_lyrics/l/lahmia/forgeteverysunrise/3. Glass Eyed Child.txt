Glass-eyed child
That looks to me
In this cold rainy day
Under the sky, painted in grey
My steps on the way
Behind the ruins of life
Are searching the sleeping passage to reality

All my silent dreams
Return to your silent grave
I fear Iâm going insane
Glass-eyed child
Take a look at my white skin
Iâm here to hear your silent, silent cries
My pure, pure child
Wait for me in your cold grave

Two steps ahead and two steps again
And thenâ¦ the headstone
The last page of your short life
My darling I canât forget your eyes
They wounded me like a cold knife blade
That froze my tired heart

Cypresses all around
Down by the graveyard
And thereâ¦ your desperate, silent cry
You sleep in your tomb
Glass-eyed child
The icy stare rapes my heart
The sky seems to fall
The sky seems to cry your young death
