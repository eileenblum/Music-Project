The Night falls down, slowly, slowly down
Your sad world becomes black
And the creatures free
Yeah, I feel so good
Yeah I could feed off of you!
All the Gods you believed in yesterday are dead
And for you tomorrow doesnât exist anymore
No more Tomorrow!

Learn my lesson
Iâm everything you cannot fight
Iâm the one you cannot kill
Now fear my eyes, so full of hate and in need of blood
Now fear my eyes
For every tear you drunk
For every cry you made!
I'll traumatize you, I'll terrorize your sons
This is my will

Blood in your dreams
I'm all that you fear: dark, cold, evil
Grinding dreams!
Iâm everything youâve thrilled in the silence of solitude
But I feel so alive
Grinding dreams!

Revenge is my only reason to live
Iâll drink your essence Iâll traumatize you
Iâll appear you in every fuckinâ dream
Iâll terrorize you
This is my will

The night falls down... slowly
Your sad world becomes black, and I am free!
Tomorrow... no more tomorrow
Tomorrow... no more
Grinding dreams, grinding dreams
No moreâ¦ tomorrow
No moreâ¦ tomorrow
For you
