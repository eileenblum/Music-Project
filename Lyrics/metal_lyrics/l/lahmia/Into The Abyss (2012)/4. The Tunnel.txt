Chaos
Suffering at night
Souls caged
Call you at this time
You can't do nothing to hear them not
Nothing seems the same in this faded place

[Bridge:]
Choice is yours: follow or not!
Beyond the night something exists
All is dead, all is bright
- A never ending suffering -

[Chorus:]
Opening the eyes
Limbo calls you
Following the peace
Into the tunnel
Live or die to be found or lost
I Feel the dissolution of forms:
disintegration of security and laws
Time is but a moment
That has been denied in eternity
It's the loss of faith, roam in this cage
Time's dead, it's all over
Nothing more turns back again

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

My spirit leaves his cage and prepares himself to go away
This is the endless night of certainty
my body sleeps without respite
But I feel free
My spirit leaves his cage and prepares himself to go away
My body sleeps without respite
This time Iâll know if I'll ride
Or if I will die again

[Chorus]
