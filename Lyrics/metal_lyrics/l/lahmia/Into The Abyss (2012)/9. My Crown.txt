I lose myself
In your green lake-drops
You: shelter for my soul
Catch my burning breath
You: the interpreter of my wandering spirit
We'll ride the night together as one
We are like birds that dare the fire
My one, my crown, my ice, my wax
My light on the way
My prayer before a dream
My white rose
My poetry
My muse, My rope, My immortal hope
The blade of my sword is yours, to serve my queen
My blood, my spine, my crown
My crown

[Chorus:]
Talk to me, please don't stop
Take me to your underworld haven
My refuge from chaos
My sanctuary from cold
In this endless fight called âlifeâ
Invade my soul

[Chorus:]
Talk to me, please don't stop
Take me to our secret place, where we know
To cure the scars that Time has left on our skin
Thank you for lighting the way through my screaming darkness

[Chorus:]
Talk to me, please don't stop
Take me to our secret place, where we know
To cure the scars that time has left on our skin
The shadows of the past will never hide
My Crown
My Crown
