The nocturne star shines high
In this black velvet sky
Disciple of the night as me
Follow this sacred chant
Follow the sacred howl
Into the astral corpse
Then scream and die to be, die to know, die to see
Die to be the fire in our night!
The nightly sky lightens to day
Hear this cold wind calls our names!

[Chorus:]
Nightfallâ¦ protect us!
Nightfallâ¦
To reach and conquer our sacred lands!
Night comes down!
Now itâs time, itâs our time
The nightly sky lightens to day
Listen! This cold wind calls our names

[Chorus]

The other brothers howl
As the rain comes to fall down
A legion of hungry wolves want their revenge
Licking blood
On a hallowed ground!
Let us burn them all [3x]
Let us judge their deadly sins!
Can you feel the taste [3x]
The taste of revenge!
The nightly sky lightens to day
Hear this cold wind calls our names!

[Chorus]

Night comes down, night falls down
