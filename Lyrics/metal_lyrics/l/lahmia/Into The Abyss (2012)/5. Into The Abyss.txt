The hate I feel
Stronger than my will to live
My soul's existence: lose to win, die to kill
My will: resistance!
Our lives sentenced
By the presence of death
The fight has begun
I'll fall, you'll follow
I'll take you down with me
Until the end of my days: I'll suffer, you'll scream with me!
Apathy becomes misanthropy
I made revenge from suffering, action from freezing
Into the abyss nothing more will be the same again!

[Chorus:]
Misanthropy, queen of my mind
Set me free from all the rotten flesh on my way
Blood: fluid of mankind's suffering!

Call it hell
This is where I live
From where I come
To where I go and you with me!

Totally dismembered, 'n killed without pride
Hear my call
Iâll come to make you know the word "end"

[Chorus]

There's nothing left to judge,
Don't be anxious 'bout what will Happen:
What is done is done
I am a stone, feel my silence... fear me now:
I'm misanthropist

My endless pain
Catches the last fresh rain,
Blinded without seeing the light
I'll make you feel my pain shining bright:
The last resistance,
A furious scream in this empty hole!
