Sweet remembrances
Eyes that I've seen before and never changed
Like a poetry sung by the wind
In the ruins of my soul
All the past smiles
Beers, wine, cigarettes burnt on the streets
All the friendly words we used to say
Now is changing
The intensity of my most inner silence
It's a melody still heard
Which pleases my dreams
With joy and melancholy
Good bye my friend

[Chorus:]
But sometimes I see you standing there
Under the stage
Silent through the screaming crowd
Time runs all alone making pictures of us
And I finally see you
Out from the dividing fog
I lose myself, my own confidence
All the questions turn to knock
No answers 'bout life and death
And what there's between
The lines of existence
My soul roars
Like a thundering scream against the silence
It's something no one will say
Something no one would pray
And my friend I want to thank you
For all the times you rise me up
For all the times you walked my dreams
For all the times you stood in the crowd

[Chorus]
