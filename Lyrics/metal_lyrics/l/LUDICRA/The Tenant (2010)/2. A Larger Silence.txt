What pace is taken
On this humbling walk
"Hurry forward" I imagine
Stroll along with no second guess

Are you quiet
Without fear or apprehension

Does it feel effortless?
Does it feel free?
Is it easy as they say?
Icy waters call you home

Does it feel easy?
Does it feel free?

Are you free?

âSilent, into a larger silence where we could not followâ *
What pace is taken
On this humbling walk

Are you quiet
Without fear or apprehension

Does it feel effortless?
Does it feel free?
Is it easy as they say?
Icy waters call you home

Leap of faith?
Slip from grace?


Are you free?
