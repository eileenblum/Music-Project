Your narrow rented tombs
Within your walls of want
The frame in which you haunt
Inside your restless storm
Your paint is cracked and worn
Four walls bubbled and pocked
Marked with shame, a bolted lock
A facade hides your worn out pride
A shoddy view of others just like you
A window rattles you with what you hide
Sickness spreads through
Your breeding grounds of dust
For all within your rooms
Your narrow rented tombs
Within your walls of want
The frame in which you haunt
Inside your restless storm
The paint is cracked and worn
Four walls bubbled and pocked
Marked with shame, a bolted lock
A facade hides your worn out pride
A shoddy view of others just like you
A window rattles you with what you hide
