No will for
A way out
From a past of blurry visions
To the present of delusions

No need for
A way back
To the baseline
To the safe haven

Dumbed down to live in one dimension
Swirled, distorted cluttered mind
Stopped the mood from swinging
Suffocated in bags of compulsion

Idler of daydreams
Picked and split apart
A sore sight
To be ignored
A dying breed

Rightly excused
To end in nothingness

No way for
A way back
To the baseline
To the safe haven

To end the nothingness
