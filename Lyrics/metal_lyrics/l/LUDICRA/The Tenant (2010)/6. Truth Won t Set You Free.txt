Vomits the absence incessantly
Blind eye of the beholder
Only sees what it believes
Perched upon the fence of truth and error
A battle cry of human tools
Perched upon the fence of truth and error
A battle cry of human tools
Truth has not yet set us free
Right and wrong raise their flags
As diverse as every man
In separate caves and clouds
Broad cast fabrication
Accusations
The power of suggestion
Fooled over persuasion
Wash their minds
Their senses
Perched upon the fence of truth and error
A battle cry of human tools
Perched upon the fence of truth and error
A battle cry of human tools
Truth has not yet set us free
Right and wrong raise their flags
As diverse as every man
In separate caves and clouds
Who is good or evil?
Who is made inhuman?
Who is the fool?
Who is fit to rule?
