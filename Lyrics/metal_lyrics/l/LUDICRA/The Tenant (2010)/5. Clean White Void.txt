Take me to the cut and dry
Cold... a frozen place
Makes me hide any expression
Makes me hide in the fake

Clean
White
Void

Teach me to mask the spirit
That rose to take its place
That farce of human bonds
Of dignity and respect

Clean
White
Void

Words are worthless
Left in silence

Confusion and blame

Let me be the clean white void
The slate...the unwritten
From this day forward
I offer none

Clean
White
Void

Thoughts are voiceless
Kept tightly spun

Minds misread, all songs unheard
