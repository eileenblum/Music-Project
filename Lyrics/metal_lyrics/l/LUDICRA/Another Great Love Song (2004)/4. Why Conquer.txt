When you paint this town red, why not do it from your veins
Let torrential tears of silver salt wash away the stains

Be not concerned with petty things like pain or shame or fear
Let these gutters swallow secrets your simple self held dear
Free the buried stones

When the last call has bled you thin
Rest on the shoulders of every sin
Remember there's no endeavor worth all the worry of the dour mind

When you yearn to switch the light to dim
This known condition will not detain you
From the sunrise of each day of blame
From the sunset and each night in vain, each night insane

Why conquer? Why solve? Why conquer what cannot evolve?
If you pick apart the one who bellows fire under everyone
Time will not heal the hearts of the dumb

When you paint this town red, why not do it from your veins
