I crave the waste - buried and forgotten
Hidden - in the greenest maze
Cremate - all this embitterment
Still - alive in the earth

Going over what was once benighted
Etched in stone
Etched in skin
Fallen ghosts through time proved this curse of mine

I crave the skies - lost stars you pointed to
I saw their haze  - I felt their warning
I felt their chill - and I fell apart
I heard them say - "It will never be the same"

Going over what was once benighted

I swore this time
Before the chills come
A shield will glaze over
To hide these questioning eyes
I begged and pleaded
I cried a storm like the foolish do

I swore the chills this time
Will forlorn all seasons that raise the blood to boil
I swore upon this molten heart
A mountain grew, a path was built, a belief was granted
It was given like a gift

Fallen ghosts through time proved this curse of mine
That echoed many more to hear and die

Rereading
What was once forgotten
Etched in stone
Etched in skin

Fallen ghosts through time proved this curse of mine
For all to hear and wonder why
