Back and forth, confusions turning
The future path is burning
From the sun to purging rain
These organs drop from loss to gain
The soul was halved, the quest uncertain
A new belief was needed
And there is time, more than you need to know

The plan was cheated

Rise out of the reverie and sway the mastery
Ascend from the history, abide to the mystery

The fool is waning not to be the last one to see
The heart is growing
It has room to give everything
It's not a thing one can learn
To sigh or to yearn?
Awake from this dream now

Rise out of the reverie and sway the mastery
What was learned from what was dreamed
Is the longest hour in the shortest year
Has been life's only theme
