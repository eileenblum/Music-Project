Is it dead below?
There is no seed, no grow
No water flows when tides are low
Scare the sea, it's easy!
Let thirst the soil!
To collide each time is taunting

It is dead below
There is no seed, no grow
No water flows when tides are low
A sea of spite, its teasing waves
Love is drowned again
Ride the sea of spite

Lichen lives, love is drowned (again)
