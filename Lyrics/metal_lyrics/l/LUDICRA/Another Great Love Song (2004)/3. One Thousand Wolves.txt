I have nothing to say that will change the way
Of the hand that led me through
The days rolled on in heart and song
But the wordless plight was due
Time was lost in excited bliss
The poison kiss of love I miss
Remember the flame remember the dark
Remember the day it made its mark
So sew the seed before it bleeds
Sever the root that will taint the seeds
Enough clues have ensued to bring an answer forth
Awake from a dream to our landfill
That is overflowing with shit

I have nothing to say that will change the way
Of the hand that led me through
The days rolled on in heart and song
But the wordless plight was due
The keeper of secrets has let the wicked free
Unchained is the lock to our diary
The eyes have cried one thousand wolves
The lips unraveled more
So I have nothing to say that will change the way
Of the hand that led me through
The days rolled on in heart and song
But the wordless plight was due
