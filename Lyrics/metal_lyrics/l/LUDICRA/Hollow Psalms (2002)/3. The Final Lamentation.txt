Lachrymal drops fall as trees beyond reach
Devoid of voice
Lacking reason
Cascading at random, salted rains
But as oft
As the tides
A tireless flow which stops at nothing
For no sense
Can annul it's weight

Crimson pearls dot twisted path
Granting clues
Of corporeal treason
Flowing with purpose as lover's tears
Yet failing
To bring forth release
Still ruby ribbons from outstretched arms
Paint a room
Red with regret

Still ruby ribbons from outstretched arms
Paint a room
Red with regret
