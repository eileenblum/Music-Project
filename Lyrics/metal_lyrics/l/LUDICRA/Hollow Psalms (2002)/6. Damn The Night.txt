Sunken eyes still have sight
To view a hope, a hope for light
Burnt tresses wreak a sour plight
This nightmare now true to your delight

If it is true, then damn the night
Embracing tomb, for it's only...
For it is your dwelling
It is your hour, your only hour
Where you'll perish and wish alone
You'll wish alone, you will see

Encased, this place of stone
Final hour to atone
(No more burdens bestowed at dawn)
Enshrouded in blackened skies
Wish for light within the lies
(When the ceaseless night is gone)

And what is left - a hollow rotting
Only eyes wait, sunken
As dead love walks hand in hand
Nightmares, hatemares
Engaging, enraging
Tonight I... I damn thee
Your night fall, your hour

Damn the night, for it only falls undone
Damn the night, for it is nothing but artifice
Damn the night, for it is only a fraud

Where you'll wish, you will wish alone
