Murdering the beast inside through time
Abandoning memories
Extracting claret
Squelching life

If we die before the dawning hour
Grant one more moment of lucid ardour

If we die before the dawning hour
Grant one more moment of lucid ardour
And the time of indecision
Before the nothing struck
Before the river drained

Bleeding in graves
Aching under
Impassive tongues
Blessed ignorance
Shaped to the sunrise
Painted slumber
Forget what matters
Awake to grey

This brain is chaos crawling
Crippled on all fours
The face belies lividity
Migrates through pores

If we die before the dawning hour
Grant one more moment of hated adoration

If we die before the dawning hour
Grant one more moment of lucid ardour
And the time of indecision
Before the dull hath struck
Before the vigor drained.

Bleeding in graves
Aching under
Impassive tongues
Blessed ignorance
Shaped to the sunrise
Painted slumber
Forget what matters
Awake to grey

Mourn in wrathful agony
Mourn in wrathful agony?
For fate's return to forever renew
The face of erudite, a plea to end
The face of erudite, a plea to end evading
Mourn in wrathful agony
Agony?
