Slithering, crawling
Through a glade, corrupting virtue
Twisted, maligned
Swallow whole the souls of angels
Controlling serpent
Constricts and crushes purest pleasure
Searing poison
Injected tincture numbs the fallen

Treacherous snake
Crawling into being
Extending existence
Passing mortality
Shadows hiding fate

It's a lie unto myself
The snake has taken everything

It is this servitude
What sickening self-revolt
Tricked into temptation
Coiled within it's folds

Blinded by self hatred
Dark shadows dominate

Rake the skin
Scales hard-edged embrace
Lost to sin, blackened
Guilt held in disgrace

Slithering, crawling
Through a glade, corrupting virtue
Twisted, maligned
Swallow whole the souls of angels
Controlling serpent
Constricts and crushes purest pleasure
Rotten inside
Injected tincture numbs the fallen
