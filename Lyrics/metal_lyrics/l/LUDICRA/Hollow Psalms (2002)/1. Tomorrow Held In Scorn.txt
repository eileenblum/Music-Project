Tomorrow held in scorn
This night unraveled goes unborn
Stars that mark are starting fall away
If we curse the sun
Can we undo what the moon hath done
Lunacy with impunity
(There is none!)

Misfortune lies beyond the dawn
What need to carry on
When the curtain draws on -
Our Ludicra...

Reverie - quelled by the sun
A chore once more undone
Crusades remain unwon
Tomorrow held in scorn...

Bask in ugly ever after
Burning, angered eyes
Troubles and their looming shadows
With the day, arise

Reverie - quelled by the sun
A chore once more undone
Crusades remain unwon
Tomorrow held in scorn...

If we curse the sun
Can we undo what the moon hath done
Lunacy with impunity
(There is none!)
