Anger burns by candle-light
To those named not worthy
A tedious wait, ceaseless
For life's toil to break

A lull that never soothes
A quiet bereft of peace
No sense of kindred binds
To those left behind

Empty...

Time, torpor, numbing ennui
Rage, hunger, void of hope

Heaped upon impassive floors
Defeated pawns forever more

Fighting darkness alone, lives slip away
Writhe in darkness alone, life slips away
Writhing darkness, a lone life pissed away
Die in darkness, a lone life slipped away
