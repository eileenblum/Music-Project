Separate and diminish
Dress with a new shell

Vanish deep, walking in sleep
Shun those who let their love show

In this defense, a selfish plea
For you to live and maybe see

If you are a riddle that tricks then plagues with rust
I'll go unnoticed like the dust

Walk the path of ash, return to insanity
Walk the trap

It is more wretched than the usual prey
Who take and fake with no merit, no trace

Gone is the one, our faces seep
We have not won, ashamed to weep

This is the toll, the broken gate
A wreath to lay on the grave of faith
