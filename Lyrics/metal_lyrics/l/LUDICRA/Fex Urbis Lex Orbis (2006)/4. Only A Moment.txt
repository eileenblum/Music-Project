Again it's time to realize
Care is no longer there
Fret that consumed every cell
Dissolved into the air
The throng of mutterings ends today
Forfeit all attempts

Charms fade and gardens grey
Ignore their waning, dying scent
No elation sent
No unmatched soul will be sought

Silence their petty whispers
Cut out their wagging tongues
Prying eyes seek gouging
When secrets come undone

No need to polish treasured wares
That expose beneath the dust
Leave the webs to cover and hide
In times of regretted lust

Charms fade and gardens grey
Ignore their waning dying scent
No elation sent
No unmatched soul will be sought

This is only a moment to oneself
Spewed forth for all to see
Its purpose, no one can tell

Break up the worn humdrum
Await a new chance
Curse aloud at the crowds
Their common march is their only crime!
Make sure to build the wall too high
No more peeking for any sign!
Shake up the slow humdrum
Churn bitters into wine
Stow the thoughts away
Until another time
Seal the holes that leaked the lies
Shun away the arms of foolery
Believe the fraud that you are wise
