Here's the sign that modern times is finally crashing down
Weeds rise form concrete beds
Dance 'til you're dead in the parking lots
Take to the rooftops and see what's left
The doors of empty homes stand open
Like our toothless mouths
Illness in a black rainbow
Rifle through their pockets while saying last rites

Here's the end that we have dreamt of
Here's the face of the collapse

Reach out for something living
See your hands are filled with dust
Walk under rolling clouds of fragmented bone

Join the fanatics and rant to the sky
The torrents of red murder mingle with the garbage
Coagulate in heart-shaped stains
Left out to dry in acid rain
Left out to die insane
The dues left unpaid are the only kindly fate

Footprints collect with soot and smother out the lines
The dwindled carry tattered wares
On calloused backs of pride
To climb the scape, the nails will scrape
They cling to hope's last ride

Gone are the days of reckless vanity
Gone are the old songs from the shore
A different set of eyes viewed the bleakest past
Open sores breathe in the new mass
Here's the end that we have dreamt of
Here's the face of the collapse

Sorrows grow with each tomorrow
To remain is now the only task
It is time to settle in the ash
