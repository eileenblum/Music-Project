Something big and bright
Looms outside my window
Choked with promise
Smother in hope
Days plod on like machines of ceaseless ruin
Lost in a forest of haunted buildings

I'm the feeble crack of light
That shines in spite of all

I'm held in place by a fragile base
I'm the feeble crack of light
That shines in spite of all
I'll rest in denial
I'll hide here for a while

With each sundown comes sickness
With each sunrise surrender
And still they come deaf and dumb
Days of incessant woe

The walk is paved in shame
The cement blocks and common sense
The lowly steep in mockery
The exalted drained all our strength
