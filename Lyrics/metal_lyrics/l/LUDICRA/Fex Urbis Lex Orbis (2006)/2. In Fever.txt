The voice has splintered to a rasp
From broken words of waste
It cast forth illusions
Of a life without mistakes

It told the worst tale ever told
And spoke of better days
The truth be told as I grow old
A chronology of decay

A piece of mind unhinged this time
The doors I've left behind

To lie and wait for an escape
Before it is too late
Wander alone through the hours
And the neverending wait

A shadow thrown across a face
A warped forgotten haggard shape
Cast on a heap of wounded birds
Their wings hang broken like these words

Broken shards of life scattered by the wind

Between each myth is a sheltered place
A place of no regret
Sanctum refuge

But you can only stay for so long
Before you stay forever
In fever, in death

A piece of mind unhinged this time
The truth be told as I grow old
And still I wait though it's too late

Wave the short-lived farewell 
Return to an unkempt shell
And finally to show your face
