Words could never describe
This feeling of worthlessness &amp; failure, always in the back of my head

These eyes tell the tale of what it is to dream, a constant screaming
Echoing an unforgiving reminder or why you fear to try
With all things set aside please show me that there's so much more to life

I've witnessed monuments fall, I've seen fields of the dead
Whereas define retribution our fingers point to the end

In act of desperation, we believe in all we see
Lost prophets point the way crawling on hand &amp; knee

Miles &amp; miles i have come to far
Just turn my back &amp; question who we really are
Miles &amp; miles pushing onward through the dark
Tribulations &amp; travesties will set the boys &amp; men apart

I won't give in [4x]

For all the countless times I've prayed not to see your face
We've crossed paths yet again its time to put you in your place
I've shown you love when all have thrown you away
Take in your final breath behold this man made judgement day

I forget where your purpose lies, you've accomplished to fail miserably without putting in the time
Passing judgement on all I know, forgetting what is right &amp; letting you go
