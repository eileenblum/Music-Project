Welcome, to the age of modern man
I pray for the worst so that we all may go home forever
Hold on, this gonna be a bumpy ride
Child there's no time to rest your head
There will be time to rest when you're dead

Mechanized death driven, peace keepers flood these streets
Bearing flame spewing weaponry
Homes smolder in ashes, the foundation of man is crumbling
Wounded crawl for salvation, missing limbs have gone astray

The dead lay flaking into open air, decomposing &amp; festering in infection
They are airborne now [2x]

Where have we gone wrong, this is a story for the ages
My legs tremble at the thought of tomorrow, for we may not see the day

World leaders corrupt television, &amp; our media
Many scan the radio waves helplessly, for a safe haven
But all there is are snow blind dying frequencies

There is no one to save us
Rebels spark Molotov's
Casting them into the open streets
Flooded with the darkest of opposition

Forward through the flames
Continuing the crusade of the free
A rise to power requires sacrifice
These hands were made to dismember &amp; maim all who stand against me
Fighting through legions of the damned, all will die by my hands

Where have we gone wrong, this is a story for the ages

Fighting this endless war, the time has come to settle the score
Now join &amp; endure, let's show them what we got
