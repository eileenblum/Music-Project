I have come broken beyond repair
This skin is torn &amp; is bearing flesh
Of everything that I used to be

Some say I'm a chameleon, some say I'm a thief
These words mean nothing
My throne is out of reach
Man &amp; beast alike we all share the same fate

My arms are open, but this heart is crushed
I've let in the enemy &amp; grown so fond of your touch
I will still remain for you to see these battle scars of everyday life
I have come to purge this world of your disease

I'll wait here for you, just for you to realize what you have done
Only for you to realize what you have done

Welcome to the dawning of the age of the elite
The weak are left alone to rot, forever strong we will be
Betrayal is the only thing that sits on my mind
I'm waiting for the day it comes to leave the world behind

Open your arms, welcome the end

My arms are open but this heart is crushed
I have let in the enemy &amp; have grown so fond of your touch
I will still remain for you to see these battle scars of everyday life
Every word we speak is where we learn to fight

We will remain as one
