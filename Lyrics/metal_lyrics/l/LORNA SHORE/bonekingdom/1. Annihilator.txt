You're so quick to run and hide, where is your spine?
A delicate misunderstanding has left your culture erased.
All done to only get a few steps ahead,
but soon you'll realize you're still at the starting line.
Why cant you see that the repetition and prediction of our demise is etched deep within the stone?
Go see for yourself.
It doesn't take a microscope to see we've ruined things for ourselves.
All for this filthy race.

Open your mouth, free your mind.
And leave it behind.

I have come bearing the cancer of the future.
Make way for the answer of the opportunist.
Riddle me cleanse me with the inevitable end to come.
Purify the unworthy scum purge them from the sight of the sun.

Annihilator.

I'm the furthest thing from sane
The bodies will piled sky high their blood is in the rain
So now where do we go from here

Things wont ever get better with closed minds
What is there to fear?
What is there to fear?
