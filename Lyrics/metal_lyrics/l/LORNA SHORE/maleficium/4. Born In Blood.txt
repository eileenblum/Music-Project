We carry our cowardice
We carry our shame
We carry our cowardice
We carry our shame
Caught in the silence
Left in the...
Mysterious happenings
Will decide what our future may bring
Some say it's nothing
But it's seen in dreams 
No explanation, no life to be seen
You're searching
Fighting
Digging through the shallow but bountiful graves
Though we buried our past below
In our mind it always stays
Scraping 
Crawling
Trying to get out
The nightmares that you live by
Night are crawling out your mouth
I pray that this is only the beginning of the end
Praise your idols
Love your damned
Sacrifice all reason and spill blood of the lamb
I have been washed in death
I am reborn
Trialed and scorned
Come to realise you're just a number in the system
Come to realise you're just a number in the system
Coursing through our cold hollow veins
We carry our cowardice 
We carry our shame
Who are you to judge and decide who should gain 
Caught in the silence 
Left in the rain 
When will you see that we have failed 
Each other and ourselves
When will you see that we have failed 
Each other and ourselves
Congratulations humanity
You have opened your arms to hell
Now is not the time to pass your judgement
But annihilate and rebuild
Why can't you see the problem
We have a lifetime to fulfill
Your body's shaking
From the poison of the world
A mysterious masquerade
A darkness yet to even unfurl
My lips they hunger for the taste of change
Dismember the common wealth
Feel no pain, no remorse
For what I've done,
For what I've done
Searching
Fighting
Digging through the shallow but bountiful graves
Though we buried our past below
In our mind it always stays
Scraping 
Crawling
Trying to get out
The nightmares that you live by
Night are crawling out your mouth
