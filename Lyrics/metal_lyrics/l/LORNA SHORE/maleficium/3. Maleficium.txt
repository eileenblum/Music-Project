I am alive

Though we can see what lies ahead
The path we tread still leads to death
For more or less
We are a mess
Fail to confess

This is what we are
I've embraced the sound of death
I know one thing that is for sure
We are the last of men on this earth

No second chances or rebirth
Soon all we will know is cold earth and futile dirt

There is no time for an evolution
Deconstruct the laws of our immortality
They say
They strive to expand the ability of man
But why is it all that I see
They try to rape us for all that they can

Deep down within the core
They plan for something more
But you choose not to see
Ignorance has always been the latest disease

Wait and you shall see
Who really is the enemy

Though we can see what lies ahead
The path we tread still leads to death
For more or less
We are a mess
Fail to confess
This is what are all will see, all will see

I wish there was a way to relay this information
Without crumbling beneath their dictation
I wish there was a way to relay this information
It's a shame that you've lost your sense of direction

Clench your fist
Scream your claim
Let them know that you exist
And bend every bone to your will
And crush every spirit in your path

Devour because that's all you know
And kill because that's what you're told

The laws of time will no longer apply
Hearts under crushing weight
And eyes bent towards the sky, towards the sky

You will see
Now all will see
