I awoke barely breathing with the pain of life within my chest
Inside the twisted heap of metal bone and fucking flesh
Testing appendages bending limbs
Endless anguish bound to flesh
Am I dreaming
Can this be my coffin dance

It's true what they say were blind to everything
You donât know what you have until you see your fading away
A hollow vessel of moments impact an empty breath
I say goodbye to those close to me

Death has its constant gaze on me
Denounce my legacy Exterminate my sacrament
Death consumed my last god damned breath

Truly this must be hell
This is where I was raised
Biting my fingers and marking down the days
Remaining unscathed until today
Sulfur fills the air
My mouth filling with blood
Pains overflowing my body
Everything is dying inside me

The cries in the distance
A melancholy beautiful tune
The emptiness in the air
And the coldness of my hands
I have finally come to peace
I am now ready to pass

A flickering of the flames how they dance in my eyes
I have finally come to peace I am now ready to pass
Long have I been waited simply enchanted by lifeâs passage
Dying is such a glorious birthright

Take my body
Take me away
I am abandoned
Just waiting for the end to come

I awoke barely breathing with the pain of life within my chest
Inside the twisted heap of metal bone and fucking flesh
Testing appendages bending limbs
Endless anguish bound to flesh

Pain echoes inside
Am I living or just waiting to die
Take my body
Take me away
