Watch me waste away
Separated into millions of particles
Reassembled into nothing
Empty space atomic waste
Face to face
Face to face with my failure

You canât seem to grasp there's equality between you and I
Subjugation separates pride into ignorance
Thinking questioning prodding for specific answers
Why do we delve into the mind of the devil

You canât seem to grasp there's equality between me and you
Subjugation separates pride into ignorance
Thinking questioning prodding for specific answers
Why do we delve into the mind of the devil

Conjuring our demos
Awakening ghosts of the past
Irrationality will always leave you in the ashes
Toying with the ghosts
Calling upon the ways of the past
Irrationality will will lead you to the ashes

Can you hear the screams violence in the streets
Endless death constant corruption and yet history repeats
Have you forgotten
History repeats

Everyone praises the man behind the gun
But the names of the dead soon escape our minds
History is written by those who taste victory
Saluting the departed

Generations knew their fate before their lives even started
Saluting the departed
Generations knew their fate before their lives even started
Saluting the departed

Can you feel the terror
How it makes itself known
We will never peak in evolution
we will only suffer and dwell as we rot in hell

Watch me waste away
Separated into millions of particles
Reassembled into nothing
Empty space atomic waste
Face to face
Face to face with my failure

Conjuring our demos
Awakening ghosts of the past
Irrationality will always leave you in the ashes
Toying with the ghosts
Calling upon the ways of the past
Irrationality will always leave you in the ashes

Nothing
Nothing
We are nothing

May they weep forever
May they weep for eons to come
Sins of the father, its fucked for everyone
Adopted by the son empires erased
We will only be dust of our past distant memories
Sins of the father empires erased
