Eternally oblivion
Reign in the manifestation of our hatred
Gaze within the eyes of horror
Eternally oblivion

The trenches over flow as our people lay to waste the earth quenches her thirst
With the crimson flow a familiar metallic taste armed with my brothers weâve
Stayed loyal to our hatred
At the end of dawn we will make our stand and guide our blades
Through their hearts

Guiding each cut like the hands of a surgeon
Plunging our steel straight through their hearts
Guiding each cut like the hands of a surgeon
Plunging our steel straight through their hearts
We come to you all mighty oracle
May the gods grant favor to their chosen ones
Plunging our steel straight through their hearts
May the gods grant favor to their chosen ones

We fight with heart
My only will is to fight for the kingdom
Bleeding dry those who oppose
Dismembered limbs left for the crows

Theyâve come to take our lives
But it seems they have forgotten we have come
In the name of violence
Armed from birth with a heart of stone we will die defending the throne
Die defending our throne

Though our foes numbers never seem to end
With thine sword and shield ill keep fighting til the bitter end
May the bones of my enemies blanket the land
For the crows to feast

May the name of our people bring fear to any man god or beast
Though the enemies numbers never seem to end
Armed from birth with a heart of stone we will die defending the throne
May the bones of our oppressors blanket the earth
Blanket the earth

Eternally oblivion
Reign in the manifestation of our hatred
Gaze within the eyes of horror

At the end of dawn we will make our stand and guide our blades through their throats
Guide our fucking blades
Though the enemies numbers never seem to end
With thine sword and shield ill keep fighting til the bitter end

May the name of our people bring fear to any man god or beast
May the bones of our oppressors blanket the earth
It's a massacre no one will remain
All their lives will end in vein
Unforgiving mortality
Denied future
Feed the gods our lives to feast
