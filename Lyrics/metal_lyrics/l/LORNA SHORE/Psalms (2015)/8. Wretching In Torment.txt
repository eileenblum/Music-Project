How I've stalked you in the shadow of the night
Disguised as a gentleman a hungry ever patient wolf
Clothing himself in sheep's flesh
Capturing bits and pieces of your scent
Savoring the hunt slavery glands
Flowing like the rivers of the Nile
Building my appetite

I watch you as you crawl through your days
Such a low life organism a wretched skin trader
How you wallow like a fucking swine in self disgust
Forfeit to lust in self disgust forfeit to lust

The only way you acquire happiness
It's fulfilled by filling every orifice
Basking in lust
Betrayed by any common mans' trust
How can you feel at all

Atoning for who you really are
Opening times of the past
Digging in reopened scars
The burning memories how they last
Count the numbers make the marks
Painting pictures with your blood
I'll show the world just who you
You will die by example

Mutilated torn the fuck apart
Exposed to the world for who you really are
Mutilated torn apart
Exposed to the world for the piece of shit you are

How Iâve stalked you in the cover of the night
Disguised as a gentleman a hungry ever patient wolf
Clothing himself in sheep's flesh
Capturing bits and pieces of your scent
Savoring the hunt
You've brought this upon yourself

Coldly carefully calculated
Grabbing the sharpest object burying it inside
Left as art and when they find you
They will marvel in the horror
I have forged that was your existence

You'll soon be forgotten
Theyâll find you face fucked with a knife
Face fucked with a knife
