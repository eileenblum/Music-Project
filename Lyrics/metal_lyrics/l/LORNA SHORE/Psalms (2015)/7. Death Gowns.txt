The sirens blare as humanity wriggles in the grip of our ultimate destruction
Who could have thought this power would ever have been sustained
No calculations would predetermine the dire mistakes We will make

Seconds pass as genetic substructure mutates into a cancer
Bypassing our cells and vexing straight into our brains

Casualties rise bodies piled into the sky
Power trip, chaos, murder on their mind
Bleeding out excretion survival adaptation
Civil unrest systematic militarization

And there was never even a trace of hope for any you
The time has come to face our demise

We are no longer fighting disease
The streets we once walked we must now tread lightly
Echoes of violence portrayed by deceit
Rivers of blood flow down the desolated streets
Face our demise

The poison we spit is our most lethal of weapons
Razor to the tongue cutting deeper with each message

The chosen few who strive not to succumb
Not believing the lies the masses stay feeding from
But keep breeding keep feeding the numbers increasing
Mankind is slowly bleeding

The poison we spit is our most lethal of weapons
Razor to the tongue cutting deeper with each message

The sirens blare as humanity wriggles in the grip of our ultimate destruction
Who could have thought this power would ever have been sustained
No calculations would predetermine the dire mistakes we will make

The chosen few who strive not to succumb
Not believing the lies the masses stay feeding from
But keep breeding keep feeding the numbers increasing
Mankind is slowly bleeding

Face our demise
