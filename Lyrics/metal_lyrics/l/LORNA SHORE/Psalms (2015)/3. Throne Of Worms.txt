Embodied inside
The greatest deception that has ever been
Far worse than the coffin I have been held within
This bleak existence has left me ill minded and heartless
I fail to feel anything at all

I've spent my days where the light cant find you
Where screaming is the only way of self communication
The voices grow louder than ever
A mind now forever gone

I've spent my days where the light cant find you
Where screaming is the only way of screaming of self communication
The voices are louder than ever
A mind forever gone

I'd sleep in the company of serpents
With no dictation
I'd lay my life down with no hesitation
No hesitation

Awakening everyday upset to see the sun shining another day
Lifeless I sway only to worn be away, worn away by the elements
My flesh for this earth longing for the dirt
Longing for the dirt

I have awoken again a silence keeps me to remember
As I lay in my coffin bed the blackness swallows all perception
A prison inside my head
These fingers and toes are numb to the bone

I've spent my days where the light cant find you
Where screaming is the only way of screaming of self communication
The voices are louder than ever
A mind forever gone

Speak of the devil and he shall appear
We all get what we deserve

A morbid recollection
A view within the dark
I try to remember the light but all I can focus on is my still beating heart

Awakening everyday upset to see the sun shine another day
Lifeless I sway only to worn away, worn away by the elements
My flesh for this earth longing for the dirt
Longing for the dirt

Oxygen depleting screaming pleading
The smell of bile inducing dry heaving
I'd never think it would end this way
Buried in a box hidden from the light of day

Never to see the sun
Within my crypt
Waiting my doom
Bound to this fate
There is no way to escape

Embodied inside
The greatest deception that has ever been
Far worse than the coffin I've been held within
This bleak existence has left me ill minded and heartless
I fail to feel anything at all
I've spent my days where the light cant find you
Where screaming is the only way of self communication
The voices are louder than ever
A mind forever gone
