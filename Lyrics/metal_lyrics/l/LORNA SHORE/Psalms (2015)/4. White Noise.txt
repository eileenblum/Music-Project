Misguided Masses,
Welcome to the age of deception.
Where all is dismantled in the system, behold.
We are insignificant a blight in the grand scheme.
A stain embedded upon history.
That could never be wiped clean.

Sugar coating this short lived existence.
Guiding your eyes from the man behind the curtain.
All cerebellums under mass control mass control.
Vapid images, lucid technology.
Synthetic oppressive force fed disease.
Crippling mankind straight to their knees.
Don't try to control me.

We are expendable, simply powder and flesh.
We are forsaken, merely tissue and bone.
We are dispensable.
Join my legion or die with the lambs.

First they wire the system so it thrives, but must die from the inside
Engulfed with the virus of ignorance and self pride.
Seeing all the people how they fester within.
Wanting and needing the means to resist.
Detained by the genes that flaw them till they die.
A culture run on war and a holy man in the sky.
Watch them as they waste their time.
Waiting for the day, for the day that they die.
The blackest days have yet to be seen.

Mindless cowards youâll only open your eyes when flesh and blood have been betrayed.
We've been betrayed.
Death happening right before your eyes.
I've had enough.

The life we live is but an illusion, a clever scheme.
Watch as the minute hands pass.
As they count down to an inevitable end.
Hound by cataclysm.
Make way for the age of deception.
Where all is dismantled in the system.

We are the insignificant.
We are expendable, simply powder and flesh.
We are forsaken, merely tissue and bone.
We are dispensable.

Control is fucking dead.
Minds re written to obey.
Don't try to fucking control me.

Misguided Masses.
Welcome to the age of deception.
Where all is dismantled in the system, behold.
We are insignificant a blight in the grand scheme.
A stain embedded upon history that could never be wiped clean.
