Theyâve come and theyâve gone leaving traces of supremacy
And alarming signs of technology
A raped earth a desecrated grave site
Former races left learning nothing from their corpses

This galaxy is plagued by an unsettling darkness
The existence of our humanity composed by puppetry from the sky
The human races dwindles weaving in and out of tribulation
Wasted space and wasted potential

If anything exists what the fuck would they want to learn or share knowledge with us
We are a living breathing joke to all forms of life

Beams of light split the clouds revealing a frightening sight
Foreign aircraft fill the sky, denying view of the heavens
Millions of heart cease at the sight of their inevitable demise

Squirm
Before the throne of thine creators
Pathetic worms the time of your kind is way past due
Whats yours is ours we've come to earth to consume
Consume

Do the earth a favor and bring cleansing fire to this land
Leave none standing
Eradicate and extinguish us all
I call upon your excellence destroy us all

I feel my soul is on fire
Internal organs shutting down
Extinction is upon us, itâs what were programmed for
Do the earth a favor and bring cleansing fire to this land
Leave none standing
Eradicate and extinguish us all
I call upon your excellence destroy us all

Theyâve come and theyâve gone leaving traces of supremacy
And alarming signs of technology
A raped earth a desecrated grave site
Former races left learning nothing from their corpses
This galaxy is plagued by an unsettling darkness
The existence of our humanity composed by puppetry from the sky
The human races dwindles
Weaving in and out of tribulation
Wasted space and wasted potential

Beams of light they split the sky
With no hesitation on who it takes inside
Our numbers diminishing all faith aside
Have we met our maker
The end is on my mind

Ripped away from the earth
Into the void that is space
Taken

Beams of light they split the sky
With no hesitation on who it takes inside
Our numbers diminishing all faith aside
Have we met our maker
The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind
