Digital slavery
An endless source of information
Knowledge is lost within the current
And yet we cant crack the code
Digital slavery
Taking control to a molecular level
Science has allowed us infinite wisdom
Whether we can channel it or waste its power
Has yet to be decided

Like a written fucking code
Digital slavery
Invested, endowed you must obey
The gamma waves
Wake up and repeat
Repetition is truly insanity
Wake up and repeat
Repetition is truly insanity

Infinite possibility waiting to be unlocked
But instead we choose to waste the mind
Waiting, just waiting
Still waiting to die

Running in circles no progress for human life
Our innovation is limited
By their profit and their dividends

Harvest of the mind
Harvest of the worthless minds

Digital slavery
An endless source of information
Knowledge is lost within the current
And we cant crack the code
Digital slavery
Taking control to a molecular level
Science has allowed us infinite wisdom
Whether we can channel it or waste its power
Digital slavery, fuck

We can be more than this
Break the fucking mold
Deny their power and
Take back your souls

We're just looking for somewhere to take our aim
Power domination humiliation
Living to make an example of you
We're just looking for somewhere to take our aim
Power domination humiliation
Living to make an example of you

We were only pawns
In the grand scheme of our doom
Standing upon the barren scorched earth
Surveying the agonizing view
Human error I beg of you extinction
Why do we continue to waste our time
The road to perdition is far from divine
Human error
Harvest of the mind

Just waiting to die
