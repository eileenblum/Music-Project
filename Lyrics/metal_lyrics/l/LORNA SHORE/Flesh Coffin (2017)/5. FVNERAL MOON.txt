Eyes roll back betrayed by fate yet again
My end draws near 
I refuse to a mark a grave 
This is not grim chance or fate
The snare was set and severed the spine within my neck

Left alive I cannot die

A lifetime of work has built up to this moment 
Hello and goodbye end times filled with self-loathing
Peaking so young so beautiful for the grave 
In comes the preacher it is your soul that he will save 
Life will cease so breathe deep
And in the end you will see that death plays for fucking keeps
No weeping no grieving just make the pain go away
My neck hung from the ceiling 

I'm so tired of living in pain
No one knows my face
No one remembers my name 
So I'll do a favor for a world who lives with shame
When you find me behind my locked door
Feet suspended above the floor

I beg for death I beg for my end to come
I beg and plead to be a corpse at peace

Eyes roll back betrayed by fate yet again
My end draws near 
I refuse to mark a grave 
This is not grim chance or fate
The snare was set and severed the spine within my neck

Left alive I cannot die

Life will cease so breathe deep
And in the end you will see that death plays for fucking keeps
No weeping no grieving just make the pain go away
My neck hung from the ceiling

I beg for death I beg for my end to come
I beg and plead to be a corpse at peace

A lifetime of work has built up to this moment 
Hello and good bye end times filled with self-loathing
Peaking so young so beautiful for the grave 
In comes the preacher it is your soul that he will save 

I'm so tired of living in pain
No one knows my face
No one remembers my name 
So I'll do a favor for a world who lives with shame
When you find me behind my locked door
Feet suspended above the floor

Life will cease so breathe deep
No weeping or grieving
