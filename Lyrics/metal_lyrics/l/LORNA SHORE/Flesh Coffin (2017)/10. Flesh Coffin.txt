We're dead inside

Born of this body
For I have not chosen
This haunted life of mine
Far beyond the astral waves of time

Have I stumbled onto the final frontier
Memory appears to be so very malleable
Now a tool rather than a gravestone to cling to
I am god

How is this possible I've spent these years perfecting the art of wasting away and so it appears that death as they claim is not the final resting place

onto the next life

My mind adrift as I weave through the dreams
Weeping before my past
Life's not what it seems
I watch it all as it all comes to pass
Memories held within my grasp

As I bend all matter at the will of my mind
I see reality we are all slaves to time

No longer pressed to this weight of this nothingness
Weaving in and out of memories that have chosen not to fade with time awoken before these once dying eyes 

Born of this body
For I have not chosen
This haunted life of mine
Far beyond the astral waves of times

How is this possible I've spent these years perfecting the art of wasting away and so it appears that death as they claim is not the final resting place

Bury the bones bury the lives
Bury the hope bury the skies
The truth of it all we're dead inside

We're dead inside

No longer pressed to this weight of nothingness
Weaving in and out of memories that have chosen not to fade with time awoken before these once dying eyes 

My mind adrift as I weave through dreams
Weeping before my past life's not what it seems
I watch it all as it comes to pass
Memories held within my grasp

We're dead inside
