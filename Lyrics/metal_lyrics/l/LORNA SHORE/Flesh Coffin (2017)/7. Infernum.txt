Bound within purgatory

Empty and frozen left to levitate in the nothingness that is gravity
Sight has seemed to fail me, my ears ring back nothing to guide me
I have torn the veil between realities
Have I been cast into the realm of where the dead will never seem to rest?
To wander the abyss that is nothingness have I been cast into eternal misery?
Frozen to the bone wandering alone cast into the realm of purgatory
Left on my own the wasteland unknown cast into the realm of purgatory

Subject to the grasp of time
Left to rot in the thought my life
I weep before the days of the past
Trapped here to know there not coming back

The limitless white vastness confined eternally to mental madness
The vastness of this madness has lead me to a realm in white blindness

Who would think that I'd be judged to be held within this hell
No one to hear or answer my cries
Is this where I rot for life?

Bound within purgatory
Empty and frozen left to levitate in the nothingness that is gravity
Sight has seemed to fail me, my ears ring back nothing to guide me
I have torn the veil between realities

Take me from this white madness
where my memories and conscious are the judge
I do not deserve this punishment
release me from this confinement
I'm fucking losing it

Torn to pieces by the demons in me
They've left me to bleed put me to eternal sleep

Have I been cast into the realm of where the dead will never seem to rest?
To wander the abyss that is nothingness have I been cast into eternal misery?
Frozen to the bone
wandering alone
cast into the realm of purgatory
left on my own
the wasteland unknown
cast into the realm of purgatory

Subject to the grasp of time
Left to rot in the thought my life
I weep before the days of the past
Trapped here to know there not coming back

Trapped in this madness

Trapped within this purgatory

Empty and frozen left to levitate in the nothingness that is gravity
Sight has seemed to fail me, my ears ring back nothing to guide me

Trapped within purgatory
