Falling apart I'm wasting away
Split in two on this table with nothing to say
Saws and knives slice open the skin
Painting red lines of such gorgeous design

My body is decomposing art
As a child I often dreamt of death
Of the day and how it would come
And what were the final effects

Will there be flies that make homes within my eyes
Will my soul split like an atom and wander the skies
Or fall to the earth with no one's surprise
The body subsides

Am I damned to wander the earth
No soul to subside I seek rest in the dirt

How can I still feel this emotion
Why can I see beyond the grave
How can I still feel this emotion
A life long lost with nothing left to save

A series of needles dive within the skin
To seal shut the incision the coroner has made within
I can't quite comprehend my eyes
Floating above my body the misery will never subside

My body is decomposing art
As a child I often dreamt of death
Of the day and how it would come
And what were the final effects

I am decomposing I have been chosen
To fall to the knife to end my fucking life

Hallelujah the day has come
Hallelujah thine body is done

A series of needles dive within the skin
To seal shut the incision the coroner has made within
I can't quite comprehend my eyes
Floating above my body the misery will never subside

Will there be flies that make homes within my eyes
Will my soul split like an atom and wander the skies
Or fall to the earth with no one's surprise
The body subsides

Am I damned to wander the earth
No soul to subside I seek rest in the dirt
