Betwixt the light and shadow
Granted power of the deceased
Life cannot continue if I do not permit it so
Scurry scurry little creatures
Have you no vigor or spine
No matter or worry in the end all life is mine

Master of all bending all to my will
Whether it flesh or a soul in time I will own
What do you envy what lust do you hold
Enfold unto the darkness
An unconquerable appetite for thine souls
And when time makes its choice to stop
Just know I'll be waiting no sign of emotion
No tear not a drop
Souls wander in the river of sticks
Corpses buried in shallow graves
Unworthy pieces of shit

Torn between dimensions I am energy I am god
Reaper of the fallen and forgotten
The unveiling of life facade

Betwixt the light and shadow
Granted bower of the deceased
Life cannot continue if I do not permit it so
Scurry scurry little creatures
Have you no vigor or spine
No matter or worry in the end all life is mine
All life is mine

Torn between dimensions I am energy I am god
Reaper of the fallen and forgotten
The unveiling of life facade

Betwixt the light and shadow
Granted bower of the deceased
Life cannot continue if I do not permit it so
Scurry scurry little creatures
Have you no vigor or spine
No matter or worry in the end all life is mine

Master of all bending all to my will
Whether it flesh or a soul in time I will own
What do you envy what lust do you hold
Enfold unto the darkness
An unconquerable appetite for thine souls
And when time makes its choice to stop
Just know I'll be waiting no sign of emotion
No tear not a drop
Souls wander in the river of Styx
Corpses buried in shallow graves
Unworthy pieces of shit
