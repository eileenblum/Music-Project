Come forth oh concealer of my demise
Speak true will I expire before sunrise
A sacrifice, I offer my soul for you to keep in return of my life
So that I may reap, for I may reap
Look where I lay reduced to hospital fodder
Broken down while slowly breaking down
I've never been one to beg or to reason with an inevitable dismay
But here I am a broken man with an offering to make
Every waking moment is filled with only agony
Here I lay for my soul to take
This is my only option this is my sacrifice
Whoever can hear my cry of reason
My soul is here to take
Finally at peace finally at ease
No longer alive to beg and plead my physical form left for the worms my memory left like photos for you to burn
And who could imagine that id be begging here like this, for one more chance for a life more than this, and whom ever choose to answer my call and plea I offer you my life even if I must bleed
I sway between the balance I denounce from the light
I'll conquer the blackest corners
I beg of you to restore my life
I denounce from the light
Look where I lay reduced to hospital fodder
Broken down while slowly breaking down
I've never been one to beg or to reason with an inevitable dismay
But here I am a broken man with an offering to make
Take my soul return me a new
I will become the alpha and omega
Every waking moment is filled with only agony
Here I lay for my soul to take
This is my only option this is my sacrifice
Whoever can hear my cry of reason
My soul is here to take
Finally at peace finally at ease
No longer alive to beg and plead my physical form left for the worms my memory left like photos for you to burn
And who could imagine that id be begging here like this, for one more chance for a life more than this, and whom ever choose to answer my call and plea I offer you my life even if I must bleed
