Please forgive me I don't think I'm the same
Reconnect me and program back the haze
No way I could ever be the same
If I could have one day to sweep this all away

I'd find a million ways to feel nothing
I'd find a million ways to be free
And everything I've lost would mean nothing
And everything I am would be me

Reinsert me and I won't ever wake
This has hurt me and I don't want to stay
No way I could ever be the same
If I could have one day to sweep this all away

I'd find a million ways to feel nothing
I'd find a million ways to be free
And everything I've lost would mean nothing
And everything I am would be me

Redefining, adjusting to this place
Understand, I know what it will take

I'd find a million ways to feel nothing
I'd find a million ways to be free
And everything I've lost would mean nothing
And everything I am would be me
