I think I'll say goodbye to the bright side
I think I'll change my mind
And let the worlds collide
I'll throw it all away
Releasing everything

I feel like I'm home again
Where everything feels right
I'm all alone again
But I am right inside

Ignoring all the pieces of my broken life
And hiding all the patches
On my beaten pride
I'm seeing everything in a different light
And proving to myself I'm still alive
I'll throw it all away
Releasing everything

I feel like I'm home again
Where everything feels right
I'm all alone again
But I am right inside

Proving to myself I'm still alive

I feel like I'm home again
Where everything feels right
I'm all alone again
But I am right inside
