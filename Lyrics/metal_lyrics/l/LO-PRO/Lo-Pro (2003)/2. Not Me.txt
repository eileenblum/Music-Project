Always waiting for the truth to come out
I'm caged in your eyes
And it's making me lie

So I'm not everything you wanted me to be
Sorry I ever dissapointed
I am not me

I lied my way in through your heart
I feel so ugly
And it's tearing at me

So I'm not everything you wanted me to be
Sorry I ever dissapointed
I am not me
So I'm not everything you wanted me to be
Sorry I ever dissapointed
I am not me
