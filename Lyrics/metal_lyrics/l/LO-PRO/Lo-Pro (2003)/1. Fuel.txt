All my life leads to the same old thing
And all my dreams leave me with broken wings

Yeah, at least I'm nothing
At least I'm nothing
Like you
I waited so long
And I hope it's not too late
To dig ourselves out of the same mistakes
And one of these days
We'll wake up tomorrow
And we'll bury this all away

All my hopes lead me to nowhere
And all my thoughts leave me with nothing

Push, I can push
I can do it
Leave this all behind

Yeah, at least I'm nothing
At least I'm nothing
Like you
I waited so long
And I hope it's not too late
To dig ourselves out of the same mistakes
And one of these days
We'll wake up tomorrow
And we'll bury this all 
Bury this all 
Bury this all away
Yeah, at least I'm nothing
At least I'm nothing
Like you
Yeah, at least I'm nothing
I'm still nothing
Just like you
