There's always something
To bring me down
There's always nothing 
To lift this cloud
There's never much of anything
And no one around
There's never much of anything
And no one around

Still I'm heading them off
Until I've had enough
I feel like I'm losing my grip
I'm slipping, but I know I will
I will

There must be something
More to this
There has to be something
More I missed
The bombz keep falling
On my head

Still I'm heading them off
Until I've had enough
I feel like I'm losing my grip
I'm slipping, but I know I will
I will keep heading them off
Until I've had enough
I will keep heading them off
Until I've had enough
