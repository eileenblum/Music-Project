I run away
But never have to go far
Cuz I know where I'll be (living in my head)
Far away from everything

You'll never reach me
Never see me
Sinking any lower
you'll never reach me
Never see me
And that's what makes me happy

Up here again
I always win
Cuz I know a way
Cuz I know a place (living in my head)
Far away from everything

You'll never reach me
Never see me
Sinking any lower
you'll never reach me
Never see me
And that's what makes me happy

All around me
I've heard empty faces
Speaking empty words

You'll never reach me
Never see me
Sinking any lower
you'll never reach me
Never see me
And that's what makes me happy
