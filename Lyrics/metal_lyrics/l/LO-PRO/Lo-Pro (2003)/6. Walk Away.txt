So I think I might just run
Into the desert sun
so I think I'm finally done
I'm sick of everyone

And I need to find a place
Where I can breathe once again
Where I'll remember yesterday
And not walk away

I feel completely numb
I don't know what I've become
But I've learned to wear it well
And nothing makes it through this shell

And I need to find a place
Where I can breathe once again
Where I'll remember yesterday
And not walk away

Not walk away from everything

And I need to find a place
Where I can breathe once again
Where I'll remember yesterday
And not walk away
