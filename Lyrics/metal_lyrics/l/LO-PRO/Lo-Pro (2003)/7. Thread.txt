I weathered another storm
But it's not the last one
I know this isn't over
I know it's just begun
I feel it getting stronger
I see clouds behind the sun
Breathe out, take it all in
Patience gone south and the cycle begins
I'm running out of words
I'm running out of time
So was it all worth the weight on my mind

And I start to fall apart
And I'm hurt by what's inside

I carried another torch 
And it's not the last one
I wave a crown of loneliness
Out of feeling overrun
I'm hung up on the ugliness
That I cannot overcome
Breathe out, take it all in
Patience gone south and the cycle begins
I'm running out of words
I'm running out of time
So was it all worth the weight on my mind

And I start to fall apart
And I'm hurt by what's inside

And I feel like it's not just in my head
When I feel like I'm just hanging by a thread

And I start to fall apart
And I'm hurt by what's inside
And I start to fall apart
And I'm hurt by what's inside
