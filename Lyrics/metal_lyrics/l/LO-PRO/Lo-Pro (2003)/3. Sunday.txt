I'm out here on a limb for you again
Around and around we go
Getting nowhere

Why can't I explain the way I feel again
Why can't I just stand
Instead I crawl to you again
Why does it always feel like Sunday
Like Sunday

I hacked myself to bits for you again
Hanging on to this
For nothing

Why can't I explain the way I feel again
Why can't I just stand
Instead I crawl to you again
Why does it always feel like Sunday

I've had enough of you
I've had enough of you

Why can't I explain the way I feel again
Why can't I just stand
Instead I crawl to you again
Why does it always feel like Sunday
Why does it always feel
