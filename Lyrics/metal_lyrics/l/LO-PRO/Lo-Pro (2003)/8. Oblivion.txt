I can't hear a sound
Can't see the world
Can't feel the ground
I can't look around
Can't see the faces
Through this cloud

I fade away into oblivion
Every second I'm alive without you

I can't sleep a wink
Can't shut you out
I can't even think
I can't look away
From the train wreck 
Of my mistakes

I fade away into oblivion
Every second I'm alive without you

I am barely breathing 
The grip around my neck
I am barely living
And I won't make it back
You, without you

I fade away into oblivion
Every second I'm alive without you
