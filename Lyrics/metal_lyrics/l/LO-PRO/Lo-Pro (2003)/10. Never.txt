I feel like I'm running in place
The world goes by, I watch it slowly drift away
One more time and I'm just stuck here
With the same

Same old questions
Same old lies
It makes no difference what I feel inside
I don't wonder, because I don't care
I feel I'm broken beyond repair

Must be nice to just forget
Sever ties, I'd watch them all just drift away
No goodbyes and I'm not living
With the same

Same old questions
Same old lies
It makes no difference what I feel inside
I don't wonder, because I don't care
I feel I'm broken beyond repair

Can I just get this
Can I just get this right

Same old questions
Same old lies
It makes no difference what I feel inside
I don't wonder, because I don't care
I feel I'm broken beyond repair

Will I be ok
