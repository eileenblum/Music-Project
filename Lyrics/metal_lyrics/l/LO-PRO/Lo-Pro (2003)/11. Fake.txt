This gets to me a little more than it should
But I still remember
Every word you said
I guess it pays to be someone
And it's ok to step on everyone

You think you are so much better
But this road you're on won't last forever

I made it this far, I made it without you
But I don't have all the answers
Like you do
I guess it pays to be someone
And it's ok to step on everyone

If I listened to you
I'd be running away from this
There's only so much more of this I can take
So fake, so fake you are

You think you are so much better
But this road you're on won't last forever
