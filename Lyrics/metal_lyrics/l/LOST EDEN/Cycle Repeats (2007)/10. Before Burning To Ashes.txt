Against your wish to be free;
It comes suddenly,
And it shuts you in society's box.
The view is darkens and blacken the soul
How do you intend to
Shut yourself up in this husk?
Before burning to ashes,
Break your foundation.

Unearth new fact of you.
Cast way anxiety.
The view is so clear.
Beat your fate. See tomorrow.
Don't forget this freedom
Consist of someone's sacrifice
And endurance.
It's egoism to misunderstand the law.

Fight against your erosion.
This body is only a shell.
(It's easy to be broken.)
Fight against this erosion.
You should fill it up.

Time approaches and you face up.
The black sky clears.
Time approaches and you will find.
The key that the next story begins.

Time approaches and you will find.
The key that the next story begins.
Times approaches, Time approaches'
And begins'
