I chose a lot while giving a groan.
Learn compromise,
This heart is torn and locked.
What's an answer?
Equations are infinite

I know how to get along in life
Add reason to this.
Persuade me into lies.
Try to stop the ache.
But everything is grey.
So I start over.

We never return to the past.
We should receive all.
Reclaim a way, rise inside.

The virus invades me slowly.
The shadow is falling down.
All depends on you.
Equation 999.

The time will come.

We are not figures,
Look for equations.
We have an end,
Overcome the limitation.
Luck and misfortune,
Success and mistake.
All you lead is your answer.
