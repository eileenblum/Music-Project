I climb the dream dumpage
Which a person threw away.
A foot shakes, I was going to give it up.
Still I brace and stand me up.

Which always losing your way.
You continue to drawing nonfiction.
Because life is impossible to replace.
All originates in your vision.

Sharpen the body, I spare the time.
Quiet a heart, I wait for destiny.

Only an action gives a result, and cut your way.

Days of a tangle, we will fall.
When you are at a loss, when you want to die.
But your story is not an outline.
It's free. But only one question'
Are your ready to make the story reality?

Overcome the gap between story and reality
