I'm the Forsaken last to eternity.
This world navigates' its down'

I search for the lost illusion.
It makes me feel mad.
Numb with cold, overflowing, out of control.
It makes me feel alone.

Continuous cry. It's for myself.
Don't erase me. I'm the forsaken last call.
Continuous cry. It's for my sake.
I'm here. Seek me, notice me.

Missing link'
Lost place'
The black past put me out' Fall'
That steals up as shadow of suffocation.
It makes me see the truth.
Out of mind, out of sight, out of control.
It makes me fade out.

Continuous scream. It's for myself.
If you erase me, I'll still rise over again
Continuous cry. It's for my sake.
I'm here. Seek me, notice me.
