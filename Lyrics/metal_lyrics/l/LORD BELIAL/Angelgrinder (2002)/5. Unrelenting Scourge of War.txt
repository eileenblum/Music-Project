Angels descend from heaven with swords in their hands
From the depths of hell- Satans infernal legions ascend
The Conquest of the world I soon shall proclaim
Victorious we'll stand, feel the blood boils-WAR!
The battle begins- our legions are foaming with wrath
We draw our hellpikes and swords as our fury increase

[Lead:Thomas]

You shall...
Fear!!!You shall fear me as I reap your soul
Cry!!!You shall cry as I spit on your cross
Bleed!!!You shall bleed for me as I tear off your wings
Scream!!!You shall scream as I slowly crush your skull

Witness your own downfall to the wicked kingdom
Where I am your reality-both day and night...
I shall torment thee until the day the last star falls down
Burning angels with bleeding wings- what a sight!

Massacre of the ones of light and hope has no end
Flesh and blood, What a scent!-I feel it in the air
Crawling demons from the very pits of hell
-comes for the weak souls of those feeble creeps
Blood and guts cover their once so white and beautiful garb
I am the supreme commander in the legions of hell!!!

[Lead:Thomas]

You shall....
Fear!!!You shall fear me as I reap your soul
Cry!!!You shall cry as I spit on your cross
Bleed!!!You shall bleed for me as I tear of your wings
Scream!!!You shall scream as I slowly crush your skull

[Lead: Fredrik]
[Lead: Thomas]

You Shall.
Fear!!!Cry!!!Bleed!!!Scream!!!

Angels descend from heaven with swords in their hands
From the depths of hell-Satans infernal legions ascend
The Conquest of the world I soon shall proclaim
Victorious we'll stand, feel the blood boils-WAR!
The battle begins!-our legions are foaming with wrath
We draw our hellpikes and swords as our fury increase

[Lead:Thomas]

You shall...
Fear!!!You shall fear me as I reap your soul
Cry!!!You shall cry as I spit on your cross
Bleed!!!You shall bleed for me as I tear of your wings
Scream!!!You shall scream as I slowly crush your skull

Witness your own downfall to the wicked kingdom
Where I am your reality-both day and night...

Servants of god- warriors of the christian faith
So this is all you can do-pathethic insects
Loyal to all that is good-defender of morality
I curse thee to everlasting agony in hellish flames
