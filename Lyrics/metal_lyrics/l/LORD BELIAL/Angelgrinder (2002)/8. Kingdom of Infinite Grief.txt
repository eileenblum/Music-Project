...Ad Infinitum...

Vast and dying land
Beneath the livid sky
Beyond the horizon
In the presence of death
Signs of great battles
Of glorious age is shown
Requiem of the moribund
Is outcried

Mayhem and chaos as far as you can see
Utter pain is shown in the eyes of the fallen ones
Rotting wings of burned archangels
Is spreading its stench throughout the air

The bloodstained plain
Thronged with dead angels
As the wind blows
Through their broken and rotting wings
The livid sky clouds the sun
And embrace the fullmoon
In the dead-pale shine of the moon
You can behold a new kingdom.....

[Lead:Fredrik]

Kingdom of Infinite grief
is spreading like plague

[Lead:Fredrik]

Harvesting innocent souls
To expand its dominions

Vast and dying land
Beneath the livid sky
Beyond the horizon
In the presence of death
Signs of great battles
Of glorious age is shown
Requiem of the moribund
Is outcried

Mayhem and chaos as far as you can see
Utter pain is shown in the eyes of the fallen ones
Rotting wings of burned archangels
Is spreading its stench throughout the air
