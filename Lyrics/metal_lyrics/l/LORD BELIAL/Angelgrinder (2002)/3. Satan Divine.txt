[Re-recorded. Originally recorded for the first album "Kiss the goat".]

I have passed
Through the gates of purgatory
Impurity is in this land a holy word
Midnight-seances to summon the dead
Infernal redeemer I invoke thee

Forever darkness, forever hell
Forever darkness, forever hell

Imperfect god, you are nothing to me
To late to reconcile
I'm falling into the everlasting fire
Forever darkness, forever hell

God's power begin to tarnish
