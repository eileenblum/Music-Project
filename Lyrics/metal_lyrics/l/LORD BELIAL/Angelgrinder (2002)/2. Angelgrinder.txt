Roaring with the sound of heavy thunder
Moving with the extreme lust of death
Spawned before the dawn of time
In the shadows and the dark it dwells
Pulsating cold blood in the ancient veins
Pugnacious as never seen by man before

Malevolence is its only feelings and thoughts
Tearing the souls and wings of all seraphim

Angelgrinder-Makes it's way through the winged legions from heaven
Angelgrinder-Grinding its way trough the angel torso
Angelgrinder-Ripping their wings and drinks the warm blood from their throat
Angelgrinder-Split open their wormeaten skulls

Feel the breath of a thousand lives
Grasping for air and the life it holds
Feel the heartbeat of a thousand demons
Pounding inside its chest with wrath
To silence the mighty demons within
It unleash its wrath upon angels and man

Roaring with the sound of heavy thunder
Moving with the extreme lust of death
Spawned before the dawn of time
In the shadows and the dark it dwells
Pulsating cold blood in the ancient veins
Pugnacious as never seen by man before

Malevolence is its only feelings and thoughts
Tearing the souls and wings of all seraphim

Angelgrinder-Makes its way through the winged legions from heaven
Angelgrinder-Grinding its way trough the angel torso
Angelgrinder-Ripping their wings and drinks the warm blood from their throat
Angelgrinder!!!
