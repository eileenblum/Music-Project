Kingdom of christ and its false prophets
Founded upon lies, built through milleniums
Kingdom of christ and its weak horde
Living in lies and by written tales

[Lead: Thomas]

See through their lies-Annihilate their false prophets
Walk away from christ to embrace our true darkness
Our black hearts is burning with furious wrath
Living our dreams while christians still dreams in vain

Born through pain, Burn and die in flames!!!

Crucify the angels, Impale all priests
Destroy their temples and harvest all screams
Molest the nuns and spit on their corpse
Kingdom of christ must be burnt and forgotten

We will burn the kingdom of christ
With our flaming black hearts
We will rape the false prophets
With our Furious wrath

Satan will crawl upon the corpse of christ
Urinate on the feeble cross of the church
Spineless creeps of the holy word
Behold your damnation as you burn

Burn!
Burn!
Burn!
Burn!

We will burn the kingdom of christ
With our flaming black hearts
We will rape the false prophets
With our Furious wrath

Impurity, Desire, Glutany and Evil
Prophanity, Wrath and Vanity
Greed, Loath and Lust
Shall be the new commandments

Crucify the angels, Impale all priests
Destroy their temples and harvest all screams
Molest the nuns and spit on their corpse
Kingdom of christ must be burnt and forgotten

Satan will crawl upon the corpse of christ
Urinate on the feeble cross of the church
Spineless creeps of the holy word
Behold your damnation as you burn

Burn the kingdom of christ!
