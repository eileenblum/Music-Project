I call upon Death
-Guide me through the ungodly passage
Grant me this wish
-I'll do what thou command for eternity
Beyond the passage
-Unknown pleasures awaits my coming
To enter the passage I must finally die!

Hate is my only light, Grief my only reality
Pain is my only friend, Death shall set me free

I'm living in a dreamless void called life
On the borderline to insanity I wander
Bestow unto me my escape from humanity
My bane will come-walk me to the other side

Cold.
No pain.
Released at last.
My bane finally came for my soul

I call upon Death
-Guide me through the ungodly passage
Grant me this wish
-I'll do what thou command for eternity
Beyond the passage
-Unknown pleasures awaits my coming
To enter the passage I must finally die!

Hate is my only light, Grief my only reality
Pain is my only friend, Death shall set me free

I call upon Death
Grant me this wish
Beyond the passage
I am no longer human
