[Lead: Thomas]

He lurks and waits for his time to harvest innocent souls
Far beyond the horizons without reach of human eyes
Never seen by man, destined never to be seen by mortals
Waiting to attack with neither mercy nor sanity

Grim mist comes with the night
No light- beautiful darkness to be stalked
Darkness unfolds, in the mist only death awaits
Strange sounds in the night, haunting growls

[Lead: Andy]

Grim mist comes with the night
No light- beautiful darkness to be stalked
Darkness unfolds, in the mist only death awaits
Strange sounds in the night, haunting growls

As the scythe of Death falls, you will hear no more
Uncovered might - Infernal power
As the scythe of Death falls, you will never see again
Uncovered might - Infernal power

"As you dream your beautiful dreams
He is the one who turns them to nightmares:
Shadow of his minatory being
Haunts you like a neverending fear of dying
He is all there ever will be in the end
He is pain yet still desirable"

[Lead: Fredrik]

He travels on cold winds - he rides the fiery storms
Speaks with the tongues of the dead (dead, dead)
His laughter sounds as the thunder roars (roars, roars)
Your heart will beat no more as he lets his scythe fall upon you

Grim mist comes with the night
No light- beautiful darkness to be stalked
Darkness unfolds, in the mist only death awaits
Strange sounds in the night, haunting growls

As the scythe of Death falls, you will hear no more
Uncovered might - Infernal power
As the scythe of Death falls, you will never see again
Uncovered might - Infernal power
As the scythe of Death falls, you will speak no more
Uncovered might - Infernal power
As the scythe of Death falls, you will never feel again
Uncovered might - Infernal power
