Here I am, alone
In utter solitude I walk
I stalk these plains alone
I'm walking the path of the dead

I have stalked this path for ages
Will it never end? When will I arrive?
I have stalked this path for ages
Will it never end? When will I arrive?

My feet search for ground in the darkness
I cannot see myself, nor can I hear my steps
As I speak no one will ever answer me again
I am alone in this black void of silence

Black void of silence
- Hear my call
Black void of silence
- When will it end?

Open your arms!!!

Black void of silence
- Hear my call
Black void of silence
- When will it end?

Tormenting silence haunting me
My eyes are staring blind into nothing

I pass over ground I can't even see
I am burning inside with a lust to die

Here I am, alone
In utter solitude I walk
I stalk these plains alone
I'm walking the path of the dead 

I have stalked this path for ages
Will it never end? When will I arrive?
I have stalked this path for ages
Will it never end? When will I arrive?

My feet search for ground in the darkness
I cannot see myself, nor can I hear my steps
As I speak no one will ever answer me again
I am alone in this black void of silence
