Burning demonvoid... I enter its fierce realm with pride
Though burning might caress', there is no light to see

Possessed by fire - my burning lust 
Possessed by fire - my pure desire

Embraced by flames and its raging hate
Boiling blood now runs through my veins

Possessed by fire - my burning lust 
Possessed by fire - my pure desire

[Solo: Niclas]

Lord of fire, grant me your blessing
This demonvoid is mine and mine alone
I shall rule these vast plains supreme
By flaming hand, by burning lust 
...And by fire!

Possessed by fire - my burning lust 
Possessed by fire - my pure desire

Fire... Burn
Fire... Burn
Fire... Burn 
Fire... Burn
Fire... Burn
Fire... Burn
Fire... Burn
Fire... Possessed by Fire!
