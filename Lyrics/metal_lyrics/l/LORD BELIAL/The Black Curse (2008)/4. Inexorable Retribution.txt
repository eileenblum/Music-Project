In tartarus, in the underworld even lower than hades
Furies, wicked demonical spirits of vengeance dwells

As far beneath hades as heaven is high above the earth
Engulfed in a murky gloom they torment those lost souls

Their eyes dripping of blood, their heads wreathed by serpents
Appalling look of dreadfulness with bodies reeking of awful stench

Daughters of Persephone - queen of the underworld
Alekto, progeny of uncleasing fury
Magaira, mistress of utmost jealousy
Tisifone, blood lusting princess of vengeance

Paralyzes the sufferers with dire shrieks and tainted means of torture
Stalking the human victims on earth as well as the dead in the underworld

Their eyes dripping of blood, their heads wreathed by serpents
Appalling look of dreadfulness with bodies reeking of awful stench

Daughters of Persephone - queen of the underworld
