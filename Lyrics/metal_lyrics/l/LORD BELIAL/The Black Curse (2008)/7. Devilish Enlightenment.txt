I'm a demon with dirty black wings
I'm filled with thousands of burning sins
From the deepest pits of hell I slither
Destroying mankind to watch them wither

Excruciating, agonizing pain and suffer follows in my flaming path
Unceasing lust for death, as I enlighten you: fell my wrath

I am the devil; I am the only thing you'll ever fear
I am nothing but bereavement of all that you hold dear

I'm a demon with dirty black wings
I'm filled with thousands of burning sins
From the deepest pits of hell I slither
Destroying mankind to watch them wither

Excruciating, agonizing pain and suffer follows in my flaming path
Unceasing lust for death, as I enlighten you: fell my wrath
