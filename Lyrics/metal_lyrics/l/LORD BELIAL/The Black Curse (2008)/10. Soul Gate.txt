Through centuries and ancient era
Eternally withstood the teeth of time
Mysterious gateway to the world beyond mankind
Hervesting all souls lost by either death or deeds

Soul gate
Portal to the world beyond
Soul gate
Mysterious gateway to the world beyond

Tyrannical sentinel of sinister lost souls
Keeper of the filthy essence of human failure and death
Supreme gateway to the sovereign of the underworld
Enter the gate never to return, never to be free again

Through centuries and ancient era
Eternally withstood the teeth of time
Mysterious gateway to the world beyond mankind
Hervesting all souls lost by either death or deeds

Enlightened by the fiery flames ascent from the abyss
Whispering winds echoes with screams from the black void stare into the madness; enter its realm to forever burn

Soul gate
Portal to the world beyond
Soul gate
Mysterious gateway to the world beyond
