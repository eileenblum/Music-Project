Defoliate the lies from the sheets of the blessed manuscript
Leaving behind a book of irrational fairytales and lore

Burning scorn of signs and statues symbolizing the dogma of Christ
Spit on the withering cross of eternal lies and deceit

Emphasize spiritual self-liberation by means of iconoclastic hatred
Deviant heresy and sincere hubris shall be the conductor of devastation

Defoliate the lies from the sheets of the blessed manuscript
Leaving behind a book of irrational fairytales and lore

Burning scorn of signs and statues symbolizing the dogma of Christ
Spit on the withering cross of eternal lies and deceit

Expose the false charlatan propaganda, used as justification to destroy our kind
Holy inquisitions against those of the dark arts
Planned in the mind of men with holy robes

Death - there's only death
Death - there's no light
Death - there's no salvation
Death - there is no god

Emphasize spiritual self-liberation by means of iconoclastic hatred
Deviant heresy and sincere hubris shall be the conductor of devastation

Defoliate the lies from the sheets of the blessed manuscript
Leaving behind a book of irrational fairytales and lore
