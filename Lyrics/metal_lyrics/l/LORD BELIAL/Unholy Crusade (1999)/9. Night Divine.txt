[Music: Vassago, Dark]
[Lyrics: Dark]

Enwrapped by darkness and spirits the sorcerer prepares an offering to his master
he stands high above the pathetic mortals who treads the withering earth
-trees shall bow, humans shall kneel, kings shall crawl nor god will stand
with a thousand sins he summons all demons of the eternal flames to come forth
he raise his dagger towards the sky and makes a gesture of a circle and a star
he speaks unholy words as the sky split open with thunder and lightning
"Exalted of this vision he starts to scream with pride in his voice as he approach the virgin, lying down inside the circle of candles
he reels the unholy words as he stabs her young and pure heart
the crimson blood is flowing so beautiful, tears from her innocent eyes silently falls one last time as her life slowly fades away to vanish into this night...
...night divine"
"from order to chaos, from the light to the night
the blood of a virgin I offer you, take this humble offering
take my soul grant me my immortality"
Legions-shadowed by their emperor
grabs his soul and tear him apart
death whisper in his ears: "come to me and stay forever"
- and the scythe of death clutch his life
The sun has risen for the last time... Night Divine
