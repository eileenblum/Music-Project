I am the lord of dark and evil spirits
neither my soul nor my heart is of the fading light
in the night I wander, in the night I conquer
destruction is to my delight

I am the tameless hate-my pleasure is your sorrow
I am the raging storms-devastator of all beauty
I am the eternal death-antagonist of all life
I am of purest evil-an image of hell itself

As I have gathered all demons from the past
behold the chaos which I will create
I know the malicious secrets of the hellish past
and I possess all wisdom of all mysteries

As night surrounds you and spirits call your name
a cold wind is blowing all over the plain
a wind of death of ice and pain
the wind you feel is my soul

I am the tameless hate-my pleasure is your sorrow
I am the raging storms-devastator of all beauty
I am the eternal death-antagonist of all life
I am of purest evil-an image of hell itself
