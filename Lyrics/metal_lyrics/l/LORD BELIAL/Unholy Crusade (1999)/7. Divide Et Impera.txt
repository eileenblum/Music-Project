[Music: Dark, Vassago &amp; Bloodlord]
[Lyrics: Dark]

And there it is - the moon
the mysterious moon
that shines so bright and clear
like a crystal ball at night
with great strength and unholiness
as death itself
and there it is - the moon
the mesmerising moon
to behold and to witness the rise of the horned one below
when he spreads his shadow down on the burning ground
and as he spreads his wings so majestic across the skies and fly away
... to divide and conquer
Diabolical legions of demons, thousand legions of demons
-an army of darkness, malice, hate and total destruction
shoulder to shoulder and with swords in their hands
to divide and conquer they march so proud
the sun has died-never to rise again, just like jesus christ
all priests will die their churches burn
their lambs drains from all blood
-a war so fucking unholy
The hellfire has risen high-to divide and conquer
the horned one stands proud-to divide and conquer
all demons raise their swords-to divide and conquer
shoulder to shoulder they march-to divide and conquer
Thunder and lightning cold winds and rain
it all appeared when the battle began
the dying priests are crying and their tears falls to the ground
as the legions are marching forward
no mercy is shown no mercy is given
they will reap this land and harvest all the souls
they bear malice against all that is holy, glorified and just
behold the destruction of all beauty in mankind

Divide et impera
omnia quae exsistimant nostra sunt
Satanus protectus il aegonis viene con il crio

The hellfire has risen high - to divide and conquer
the horned one stands proud - to divide and conquer
all demons raise their swords - to divide and conquer
shoulder to shoulder they march - to divide and conquer
Slay molest and destroy is their only commands
which they obey with pleasure
their master stands so pleased and watch this devastating battle
he smiles and scream in great rejoice
as all priests and nuns are slayed
all christ believers can now behold their creation and vision fade away
finally the kingdom of hell with its supreme lord can rule this world
he has risen high-to divide and conquer!
Dogs of christ-you christian whores
the final battle of all souls is here
down on your knees and pray (though your prayers won't help you)
cause it's time for you to die
unleash the beast within-the dark soul that breeds in man
set your demons free, behold their strength and give up your soul
thou shalt not be saved. thou shalt be enslaved
you christian whore!
damnation awaits
you christian whore!!!
And there it is the moon - the magical moon
that witnessed the rise of the horned one below
which ended with the destruction of all beauty in mankind
the kingdom of hell: victorious
The hellfire has risen high - to divide and conquer
the horned one stands proud - to divide and conquer
all demons raise their swords - to divide and conquer
shoulder to shoulder they march - to divide and conquer
Slay molest and destroy are their only commands
which they obey with pleasure
their master stands so pleased and watch this devastating battle
he smiles and scream in great rejoice
as all priests and nuns are slayed
all christ believers can now behold their creation and vision fade away
finally the kingdom of hell with its supreme lord can rule this world
he has risen high-to divide and conquer!

The hellfire has risen high - to divide and conquer
the horned one stands proud - to divide and conquer
all demons raise their swords - to divide and conquer
shoulder to shoulder they march - to divide and conquer
