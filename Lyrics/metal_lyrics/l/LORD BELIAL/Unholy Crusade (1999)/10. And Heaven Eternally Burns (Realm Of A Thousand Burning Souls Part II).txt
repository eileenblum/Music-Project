...And god wept as the blood of the last of his angels washed away
the last remains of the goodness in his beautiful kingdom
that now stood in raging flames and all evil demons was spreading
their wickedness and plague as fast as rolling storms,
to haunt for all eternity

...And god wept as we baptized his last angel
in his own blood - his wings withered - his white cloak became red,
he cried in sorrow, vain and despair - we liked to hear him scream

...And god wept as his blood silently left his body to fill our cups with
tasteful wine
that we drank to celebrate our glorious victory - as he died a painful death

-Withering wings and a burning heaven
-god is dead...We prevailed

On this cold and beautiful midwinter night
the cold breeze of the winter wind blew in the hair of the
dying angel and the voice of death silently whispered,
so silent-yet how majestic it was, it whispered as the
weak angel cried over the death of his god
-how sweet it was to behold...

His wings could no longer bear him,
nor his pure heart of innocence could beat no more-
his visions of a holy and humanitarian world was forever crushed
-this angel was to be no more, now he's dead.

Now I have destroyed the ones that I despise and hate,
my journey has now come to an end,
in the horizons beyond the crushed gates of heaven
you can behold thousands of burning angels,
impaled on their crosses of innocence and beauty
-and demons they shall become.

god is dead- I'm the ruler of the universe
-all beauty in man is gone...and heaven eternally burns
Earth to us, ashes of angels and dust of heaven
