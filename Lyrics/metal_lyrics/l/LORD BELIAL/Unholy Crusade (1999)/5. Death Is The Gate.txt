[Music: Dark, Vassago]
[Lyrics: Vassago]

Death - I have been waiting for you
for so many years
now that the moment has come,
let me take your hand
let me enter your kingdom of darkness
the realm of everlasting night!
You have showed me visions in life
that few men have seen
you have been whispering to me
the things to be done
and now that the moment draws near, finally I enter you with pride!
I am floating
an endless river never witnessed by man
I am embraced by its darkness
and caressed by cold hands, caressed by cold hands
in total darkness, this everlasting night sweeps me away
into a void of darkness
never witnessed by man
no agony, no sorrow, no grief, no pain
no anguish, no fear, just DEATH, sweet death
In total solitude I release my soul into this void
of coldness and hate
my spirit is cleansed from the last remaining human feelings and needs
I am one with the night, all there is I can feel
all there was I can hear, all there ever will be;
I can witness it all!
I throw myself into the realms of hell, billions of voices greets me:
"Oh, my son, finally you have joined us
now come, let eternity unite!"
Welcome once more!
Freed from the chains of life,
the final cleansing approaches my soul
Oh, how mighty this majestic mightiness
to be the edge of this force, the peak of destruction!
I am the force of Armageddon!
Their flesh shall be ripped from their bodies and their eyes shall be ripped from their skulls and their hearts shall be thrown into the everlasting fire, thus delivering their
souls onto hell, with guidance of our everlasting ritual to channel their souls from earth and into the cosmos of starless night, with the blade of damnation in my hands I
continue this immortal fight, the triumph over humans, the fight that I have dreamt of so long it goes on and on and on and they will ever be my slaves this night the
night that is endless, oh gather onto me and throw your lives onto me and let me forever be the one that delivers you from goodness into darkness and let me forever
torment you: I shall ever be your utter plague and fear, PLAGUE AND FEAR!!!
Sweeping the nightsky with the blade of damnation, our army sweeps the earth and no life is spared, the time for total death has arrived and the channeling of souls
increases in number as we hunt for life, our massive force, an invincible force of evil that haunts the nightsky on this night of death and suffering and torment and torture
and evil and darkness and death and bleeding and weeping and total destruction and the final Armageddon!!!
