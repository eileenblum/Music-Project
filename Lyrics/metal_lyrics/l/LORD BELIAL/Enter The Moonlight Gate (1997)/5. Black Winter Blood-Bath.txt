[lyrics by Sin, music by Vassago and Dark]

Once again... these fields I walked for eternity bloodred snow covered my
enemies eyes of ice staring blind on me.
Once again... the voice calls for me to come for my reward - another kingdom
to rule.
Once again... IÂ´ll create a new world and enslave the souls of my enemies as
I've done since the birth of time.
... Black Winter Blood-bath !!!
Once again... thousand years has gone the web of time closes in I change into
a crystallised chrysalis - my anger chained until he speaks my name again.
Black Winter Blood-bath!!!
Once again... Armageddon comes closer - Total War! ... Black Winter
Blood-bath!!!
