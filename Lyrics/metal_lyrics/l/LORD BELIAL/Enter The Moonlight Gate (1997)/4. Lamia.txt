[lyrics by Dark, music by Dark and Vassago]

Lamia...
you shall come to me and stand by my side
'till the end of time
Ooh...welcome to my kingdom shrouded in darkness and hate come and make me
immortal Lamia... you're so beautiful, with your burning face and your body
red of blood
Together we shall reign this world
together we shall spread our wings and fly
we will fly over this land and then they will fear us
'cause they know that they are weaker than us - and so do we and therefor
they must follow us,
or die in eternal pain - to die in the eternal flames - to die in the eternal
flames- die
I will proclaim my powers to all living creatures so come Lamia and join my
dark crusade
the dead will rise from their graves when you call for them - feel your power
and join me
Together we shall reign this world
together we shall spread our wings and fly we will fly over this land and
then they will fear us 'cause they know that they are weaker than us - and so
do we and therefor they must follow us, or die in the eternal pain Together
we shall spread our wings and fly
