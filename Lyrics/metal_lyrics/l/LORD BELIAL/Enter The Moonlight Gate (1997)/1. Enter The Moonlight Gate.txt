[Lyrics by Dark, music by Dark and Vassago]

I... I am bewitched by the pale silver-moon
in the black and ancient skies.
Shadows...
I am surrounded by mighty shadows - I am embraced by the night!
I raise my hands to the black skies
as I see the moonlight through the clouds, it shines on me!
Moonlight... I am surrounded by a silvery moonlight
I am embraced by the night
-embraced by the night!!!
Fire... burning through my veins
as my life starts to fade,
my soul leaves the earth, through the winds...
into the night !
Cold winds of hate begins to storm.
Now I am chained inside the walls of eternity.
I will enter the moonlight gate,
I will chant this everlasting night-embracement
I will enter the moonlight gate
- Chaos ... a war between darkness and light
I will open up the skies,
tear all the angels wings and laugh as they die,
there will rain tears and blood from the heavenly paradise
......We will prevail,
In this moon-filled air......
Die!!!!
I... I am bewitched by the pale silver-moon
in the black and ancient skies
Shadows... I am surrounded by mighty shadows
I am embraced by the night
-By the night !
Enter the moonlight gate!!!
