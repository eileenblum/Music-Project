[Lyrics by Dark, music by Dark and Vassago]

In remembrance of the time when I was free - before the day I was born,
I hated my life
I had to die so that I could be free again, free again... aeon!
I had to die so that I could be free again, free again... aeon!
In remembrance of the time when I was free - before the day I was born I
hated my life I had to die so that I could be free again... aeon
Towards the towers black, to reach my kingdom
towards the towers black, to reach the realms of eternity
I've walked a thousand years in an everlasting night on the path with endless
horizons and eternal time. the path with endless horizons, and eternal time!
With the towers of black by my side I summoned shadows and spirits, evil and
storms rain and fire, to come forth and take my soul.
A blaze from the black skies took my earthly life!
...Now I am one with the eternity!
The skies turned to red as the earth started to burn and shiver the rain that
silently poured turned to blood as it reached to the ground
the ground that now was crimson by blood and fire, blood and fire
I gazed into this creation of grimness and evil as my soul became one with
the winds
my eyes turned into stone and my heart became frozen and black - the time had
come for me to die.
I felt coldness and pain, yet I was rejoiced by death ... I now was freed!!!
