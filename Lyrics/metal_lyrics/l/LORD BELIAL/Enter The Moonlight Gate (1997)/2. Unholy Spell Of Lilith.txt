[Lyrics by Dark, music by Dark and Vassago]

Lilith, come forth to me
as I blazon these words
... Shem Ham Forash
Come forth, I summon thee- come forth and make the angels perish, oh Lilith
-They will die crying for their god !
Shem... Ham...Forash
as I blazoned these words of Lilith the midnight skies opened in front of my
eyes
from the aperture in the skies a blaze of evil light was seen - it was the
black light from Lilith that made the angels perish in pain
In the land with the blackened winds
the spirits of the feeble ones will die
abandoned by their weak beliefs, they will die crying for their god
they will die crying for their god in the land with the blackened winds- they
will die
When the angels died blood-red tears fell from the skies
screams of fear echoed in the night- when the angels died
In the land with the blackened winds
the spirits of the feeble ones will die abandoned by their weak beliefs- they
will die
From the aperture in the skies a blaze of evil light was seen - as I blazoned
these words, these words of Lilith; Shem...Ham...Forash
