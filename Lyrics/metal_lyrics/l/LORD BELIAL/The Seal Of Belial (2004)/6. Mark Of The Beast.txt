Under the blackened skies at night
Souls are gathering around the sacrifice
Legion of evil, destruction and malice
Innocent virgins of youth are soon to die

Behold the mark of the beast - 666
Behold the mark of the beast below
Behold the mark of the beast - 666
Behold the mark of the beast below

Tear the flesh, consume their souls
Teach them the meaning of pain
Blood rains as life is torn apart
Lifeless bodies over the plain

Behold the mark
Behold the mark of the beast
Behold the mark
Behold the mark of the beast

Tear the flesh, consume their souls
Teach them the meaning of pain
Blood rains as life is torn apart
Lifeless bodies over the plain

Under the blackened skies at night
Souls are gathering around the sacrifice
Legion of evil, destruction and malice
Innocent virgins of youth are soon to die

Behold the mark of the beast - 666
Behold the mark of the beast below
Behold the mark of the beast - 666
Behold the mark of the beast below

Tear the flesh, consume their souls
Teach them the meaning of pain
Blood rains as life is torn apart
Lifeless bodies over the plain

Behold the mark
Behold the mark of the beast
Behold the mark
Behold the mark of the beast

Behold!

Behold the mark
Behold the mark of the beast
Behold the mark
Behold the mark of the beast
