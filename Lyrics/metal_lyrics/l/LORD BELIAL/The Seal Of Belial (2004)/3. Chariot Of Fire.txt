Infernal, eternal
Belial- Lord of the North

Hear my call for utter pleasure
I call for thee and thy wisdom
Bestow unto me my will and my lust
Grant me the power of thine seal

King of all wickedness, desire and lust
Belial- Majestic Lord of the earth

[Lead: Fredrik]

Chariot of fire pulled by the dead
The throne of Belial- my master!
The seal of the north paints the sky
Every star once litened now fades away

King of all wickedness, desire and lust
Belial- Majestic Lord of the earth

Bestow unto me my will and my lust
Grant me the power of thine seal

Chariot of fire pulled by the dead
The throne of Belial- my master
The seal of the north paints the sky
Every star slowly fades away
Chariot of fire pulled by the dead
The throne of Belial- my master
The seal of the north paints the sky
Every star slowly fades away

Fades away
Fades away
Fades away
Fades away
