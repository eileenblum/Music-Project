[Lead: Thomas]

Endless and dark, cold winds of death
Misty shadows lurk in the night
Burning the sacred plains of christ
Destroying the churches with pure hate

Destroy!
Deathriders from the abyss rise and destroy
Ride the dark and cold winds of death
Armed with hate and unrelenting fury
Souls of once fallen warriors are rising

[Lead: Fredrik]

Apocalyptic chanting
Demonic possession

The Unholy Cult of Belial gathers for attack
Destroying all in their way and crushing all the weak
Feeble creeps of christ are ripped and torn to pieces
Churches are flaming high by the flames of satan

Destroy!
Deathriders from the abyss rise and destroy
Ride the dark and cold winds of death
Armed with abysmal hate
