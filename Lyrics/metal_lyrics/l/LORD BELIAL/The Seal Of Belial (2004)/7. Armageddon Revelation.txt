Destruction of the light
Manic depression gather

[Lead: Thomas]

Surroundings closes in
Panic spreads like plague
War between fellow man
Massive flood of tears

No lord of salvation
No either love nor solace
Emptiness is supreme
Fear consumes all hope

Surroundings closes in
Panic spreads like plague
War between fellow man
Massive flood of tears and blood

Destruction, Depression, Panic, War
Emptiness, Fear, Armageddon Revelation

[Lead: Andy]

Destruction, Depression, Panic, War

Every lie is a dying hope
Every hope is a dying lie
Salvation is far from near
The only truth is Armageddon

No lord of salvation
No either love nor solace
Emptiness is supreme
Fear consumes all hope

Surroundings closes in
Panic spreads like plague

[Lead: Thomas]
[Lead: Fredrik]

Emptiness, Fear, Armageddon Revelation
