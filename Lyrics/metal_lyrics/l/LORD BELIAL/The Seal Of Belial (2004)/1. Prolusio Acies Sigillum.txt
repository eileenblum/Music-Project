"In the beginning there was serenity then came the unrelenting scourge of 
war
Hatred releasing it's flames upon humanity: lusting for blood of their 
fellow man
Primal beasts born through shells of meekness returning the earth to what it 
once was

In the beginning there was darkness then came the light which we defy
All who lives by the faith of the light... who believes that they are 
righteous, without sin
Shall soon feel the wrath of the rising darkness and taste it's fury as it 
covers the dying sun

If there is peace
- Hate shall engulf it all!!!

If there is light
-There will come greater darkness"
