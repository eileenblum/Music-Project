I gather all wicked souls of the north
I summon the infernal legions of hell
From the depths of my soul I scream
I call for thee, hear my chanting cries
Dark is the time for the human kind
All that is shall be mine and mine alone

Wicked souls
Come forth
Infernal legions
Come forth
Evil demons
Come forth
Black angels
Come forth

Dark spirits follow my chants
Gather around me- hear me
The evil seed shall be spread
Demon growth shall increase

[Lead: Hjalmar]

Dark spirits
Come forth
Evil seed
Come forth

Dark spirits follow my chants
Gather around me- hear me
The evil seed shall be spread
Demon growth shall increase

I've gathered all wicked souls of the north
I've summoned all infernal legions of hell
From the depths of my soul I screamed
I called for them and my chanting cries was heard
Dark is the time for the human kind
All that exists is now mine and mine alone
