Step out of this false reality
Into the timeless dominion
Enter the realms of the unknown
Seek its majestic splendour

You were born screaming
Crying in rage of being born
Now scream, as you are reborn
Make the ones you hate cry for you

Pass through the gates of this life
Feel the immense pain as you die
Walk the pain-filled path of death
Onward to the very pits of hell

Bizarre and twisted bodies without life
The instruments of your wicked deeds
Faceless yet with an image of suffering
Your dead will do what thou command
