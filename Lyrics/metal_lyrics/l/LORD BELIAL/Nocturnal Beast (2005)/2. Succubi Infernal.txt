Once darkness falls, shadows unleash the she beast of the night
She come with the dark, stalks the shadow with pride
Mistress of a thousand craving men, burning lust unfold
Seduce them in their dreams to steal away their souls

Succubi infernal - queen of the night
Gruesome splendour with fatal desire

Succubi infernal - queen of the night
None shall flee but perish in ecstasy

Obsessing succubi silently walks through the dark
Allure them holy men into depravity and lust
Stare into the haze- behold the creature of the night
Beware of her eyes which swallow your sight
Grotesque yet beautiful visions glorified by creature of the night
Succumb for the fatal beauty of the temptress of darkness

Succubi infernal - queen of the night
Gruesome splendour with fatal desire

Succubi infernal - queen of the night
None shall flee but perish in ecstasy
