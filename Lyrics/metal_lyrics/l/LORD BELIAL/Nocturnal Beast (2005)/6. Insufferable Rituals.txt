Walls of flesh with skulls as decoration
Black candles burning with furious desire
Chained to the walls of rotting flesh
Screaming sacrifice await its fate

Insufferable rituals, burning with flaming hate
Burn the crucifix; sacrifice all men of god
Insufferable rituals, burning with flaming hate
Burn the crucifix; fill the holy grail with blood

Unholy rites prepared by evil hands
The infernal mass of malice shall now begin
Immense pain of flaming fire caress the sacrifice
Screaming and twisting on the altar of burning marble

Insufferable rituals, burning with flaming hate
Burn the crucifix; sacrifice all men of god
Insufferable rituals, burning with flaming hate
Burn the crucifix; fill the holy grail with blood
