Wandering through the cold mist as night falls
Stalking the pale and dying face of the earth
Reflections of past life is haunting me
Dark deceptions... no solace

Onward I must carry on
As I hear the splendid call
Cold fog and freezing wind
Yet blistering vision in my mind

Onward I must carry on
As I hear the grandiose call
Cold fog and freezing wind
Yet blistering vision in my mind

Sorrow and despair clouds my mind
Soulless drifting on human soil
Reflections of past life haunt me
Dark deception... no consolation
