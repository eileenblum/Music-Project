Shadows spread slowly across the sinister plains
The sun no longer shines - obscurity arise

Hear me now - open up the hours of darkness
I summon the evil spirits of shadows (shadows)

The curtain of false reality falls yet one more time
Revealed is the frozen and gloomy unclothed night

Nocturnus - obscurity arise

The full moon offer its radiance as guidance
Behold the night and its wretched creatures

Nocturnus Cantus, Spero Sum Tenebrae
Ego Evocatio Malum Ad Cantito Nocturna

Nocturnus - obscurity arise

Obedio Coram Formulae Solvere Tenebrae
Eo Superba In Malitia, Spero Sum Nocturna

Nocturnus

Hear me now - open up the hours of darkness markeringar
I summon the evil spirits of shadows (shadows)

Guided by the full moon I sweep the blackened sky
Cleansing the night of the last remaining light

NOCTURNUS!
