Deep down within, obscurity spreads insistently
My hollow and dark soul is bonded with my flesh

A bright dimness of black, an evil crimson shade
Withdraw the drapes - set the wickedness free

I tear my flesh to unleash my soul
I tear my flesh to be freed

With blooded remains I slither in pain
I am not alive nor am I dead

Now I am free from my life
Still I feel... I'm bound to my flesh

I tear my flesh to unleash my soul
I tear my flesh to be freed

Deep down within, obscurity spreads insistently
My hollow and dark soul is bonded with my flesh
