Apparition and sinful souls gather
Have knowledge of thine providence
Mischievous specters shall heed thy call
Bestow to the world thine dominion

Irreverent dominion
Monarchy of the dead
Irreverent dominion
Kingdom of death

Submit, you conquered ones; down on your knees
Offer yourselves as the insignificant breed

Evil souls lost from ancient battles gathers
Alteration begins, shells of dying men increase
Shallow graves widen from horizon to horizon
Irreverent dominion - a monarchy of death

Irreverent dominion
Monarchy of the dead
Irreverent dominion
Monarchy of Death

Apparition and sinful souls gather
Have knowledge of thine providence
