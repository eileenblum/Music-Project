[Lyrics: Thomas]

I rekindle the past
When obscurity absorbed this land
With bestial rejoice
With comprehension of corporeal dissension
i will cast you down and mock you
-Down on your knees!
-Die!

You feebleminded hypocrites
Behold the withdrawal
It will resorb your righteous light
And throw you into the eternal fire

"I can see the light fading away
Into the frozen shadows"

Overwhelmed with fire and flames
I was forlorn of hope
Bur now I'll reclaim my domain
Abandoned souls on a voyage to the exhumation of life
Revoke all the heretic ones and let them take form
as dark as they used to be

"I can see the light fading away
Into the frozen shadows"

I throw the crucifix
In front of your so called god
I am rejoiced to see his downfall
I mock you-righteous ones
I mock you-false dissemblers
I mock you-Crawling ones
I curse you to the frozen shadows

All those who try to come back
Shall be burnt at the stake
You're all forlorn by your god
I have reclaimed my domain
And I will neglect your existence

"I can see the light fading away
Into the frozen shadows
