[Lyrics: Thomas]

A long, long time ago
The ancient slumber
From a forest unknown, bestowed unto me my final rest
I was dying, I was all alone

A long, long time ago
The ancient slumber
My time was come to die
I was the chosen one
So it unified me with my destiny

When the dawn was near
In the sombre wilderness
This strange voice called me to the ungodly tower
There stood a man in a black gown, he started reel to me
The satanic poetry of the unholy

Winds of fire, began to storm
Through the crimson landscape
Now I know what's in the depths below
A mystic bizzare voice it calls for you now
To descend into the amorphous land

The ancient slumber
It calls for you now
The ancient slumber
My time was come to die
I was the chosen one
So it unified me with my destiny
