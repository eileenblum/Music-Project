[Lyrics: Micke]

Grace of god
Show no mercy
Liar!
Holy Priest attempts to walk athwarts the sea
With gusto to the truth
Sinner!
Jesus Christ believer

In rememberance of the holy god, we walk among you jesus christ
In the grace of god, the almighty father "amen"

Christianity-Crist Insanity-a germ of death
Lay down your soul and follow the ten commandments...to the end
Realise the truth-rotting christ
Fucking quandary
Never to be fooled
Never to arise
