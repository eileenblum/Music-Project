[Lyrics: Thomas]

in the light of the fullmoon
Behold the shadow of my spirit
That spreads it wings on the ground
In the light of the fullmoon
I am immortal

High above the clouds
i could see the sun fade away
It doesn't shine no more
This beautiful night is forever and ever

In the light of the fullmoon
I behold the river of tears below
I am the enchanted one
That flies in the light of the fullmoon
The river of tears, derived from all humans in vain
In the light of the fullmoon
