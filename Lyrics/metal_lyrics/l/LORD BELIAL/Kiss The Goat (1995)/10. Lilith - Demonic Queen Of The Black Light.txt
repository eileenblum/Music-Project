[Lyrics: Thomas]

In the deepest forests
In the shades of grey
Beyond fear
Lilith- Queen of the black light awaits

She is one of the tyrants
She is one of the darkness
With a blaze of thorns
She will demand your soul
Behind the dark side of the mirror
In another dimension, when the black sun is awakening
Lilith- Queen of the black light awaits

When the night has come
She sings to me
Her echoes of silence from the cold mist
Surrounds me like a sea of fire
She mesmerizes me with her screams of silence
Lilith- Queen of the black light awaits

Bloodlord - Bass
Sin - Drums
Lilith - Flute
Dark - Vocals, guitar
Vassago - Guitar, vocals
