[Lyrics: Thomas]

Beyond all horizons
Beyond all dreams
In the cold and evil north
I belong for eternity

I am the lord without a master
I am Belial, the warrior from the north
I am the spirit from the mysterious kingdom of the unknown
I am Lord Belial
I am the mighty warrior
I am Lord Belial
The spirit from the mysterious kingdom
Where angels fear to tread
Those fucking angels

I am old but wise
I am the mystic entity
That you can hear whispering in the night
