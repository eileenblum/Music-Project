The whispering darkness, never spoken of before
Lack of spiritual existence, endless aeons of nothingness

Storms with no wind
Dead sun with no light
Moonless sky with no stars
All is eternally dead
Aeons of oblivion
Beset by emptiness
Everlasting obscurity
All is eternally dead

The whispering darkness, never spoken of before
Lack of spiritual existence, endless aeons of nothingness
A deep void of emptiness
Where no life dwells, where death is supreme
March towards the gate and be free

A deep void, a gate of nothingness
Where no life dwells, where death is supreme
March towards the gate of oblivion
Enter the gate and be free
