Impious visions
Glorification of malevolence
Craving for a sacrifice
Rising as the fiery flames
Quenching life by the thousands

Rise
Slay them all
Rise
As the fiery flames

United we shall stand, divided we will fall
Discipline and hate shall conquer them all
None left behind, show no mercy
Slay them all and rise as the fiery flames

Rise
Slay them all
Rise
As the fiery flames

Rise
Slay them all
Rise
As the fiery flames
