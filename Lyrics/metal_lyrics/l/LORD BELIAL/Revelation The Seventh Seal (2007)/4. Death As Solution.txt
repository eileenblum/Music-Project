(Life in your eyes slowly faded away
Tears running down your chin
Wrists sliced open, all covered in blood)

As I saw you die
Repugnant emotions growing
Running away from life
Despicable pathetic death as solution
With lack of strength you died
Died by your own hands
Spineless as a crawling worm
Despicable pathetic death as solution

Constant fear and inner fright
Pleading for death in the cold night
Constant fear and inner fright
Begging on your bare knees

(Life in your eyes slowly faded away
Tears running down your chin
Wrists sliced open, all covered in blood)
