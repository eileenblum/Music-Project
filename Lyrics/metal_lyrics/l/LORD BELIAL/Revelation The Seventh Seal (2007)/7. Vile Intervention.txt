A mighty shadow was cast over the vast plain that I used to stalk at night
A shadow of hatred, wickedness and eternal death, even the full moon seemed to shine with evil
At once I saw as the shadow was growing in silence that the darkness it spread
Plagued all of the earth
I could before my eyes behold an army of demons
A legion of purest evil, lead by the northern master himself!

"Emperor of the legions from hell, Master of all evil, King of all sins
I praise thee! - I worship thee!
I lay down my sword and soul to do what thou command
Cleanse my soul from all goodness and beauty
Give me a sword forged by fire from the very depths of hell
Show me your enemies and I'll show them the meaning of pain and anguish!"

A place was made for me in this legion of damnation
Oceans, seas and rivers started to boil
Blood was slowly filling the trembling earth
That now was covered by the shadow of my master

Drink the Blood of angels, eat their flesh, feel their life rush through your veins
Crawl in the dust of others, scream as a newborn child
As you are reborn into sin and ultimate darkness

The blood of all corpses is spreading its stench all the way to the heavenly kingdom
Where both angels and the almighty god is crying like his children whom we now possess
Darkness slowly outgrew the life of all meek and mild
Burning the temples of Christ, havens for their weak minds
Fire, screams and fierce destruction shall forever reign
Triumphant screams of demons haunts this night of death
