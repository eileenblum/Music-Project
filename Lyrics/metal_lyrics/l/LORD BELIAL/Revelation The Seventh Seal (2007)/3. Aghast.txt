Screaming and twisting in pain
Devilish and gruesome laughter echo

Dreadful deeds never to be undone
Horrified by boundless anguish

Shattering thoughts of oppression
Disgusted by the repulsive reality
Accept the gift of poisonous words
Salute the termination of your life

Dreadful deeds never to be undone
Horrified by boundless anguish

Subliminal fear, constant grief
Caress the black shade by your eyes
Certainty of your sublime death
Open your eyes, you are dead

Dreadful deeds never to be undone
Horrified by boundless anguish
