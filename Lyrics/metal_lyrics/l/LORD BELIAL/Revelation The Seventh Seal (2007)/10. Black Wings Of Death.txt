A mighty shadow was cast over the vast plain
These plains I used to stalk at night, now so dim
A shadow of wickedness and eternal death
Even the full moon seemed to shine with evil

Emperor of the north, commander of torment
Master of all immorality, king of all sins
I lay down my soul to submit under your will
Cleanse my soul from all decency and beauty

At once, I saw as the shadow was growing
- growing in silence yet with pride and strength
Obscurity insistently broaden in its growth
- overwhelming the earth and all creatures within

Encircled by demons in this great cold night
Seas and rivers started to boil as blood filled the trembling earth
The earth that now was enclosed by an endless shadow
All there is shall be covered by those Black Wings of Death

Emperor of the north, commander of torment
Master of all immorality, king of all sins
I lay down my soul to submit under your will
Cleanse my soul from all decency and beauty

Marching forward as darkness slowly outbreed the life of all meek and mild
Experience the wicked lust as the black night falls one final time
Dominant demons shall forever possess this earth
- Behold the eternal summoning of fallen souls
