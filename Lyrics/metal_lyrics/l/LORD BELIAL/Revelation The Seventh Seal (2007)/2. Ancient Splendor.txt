The dying light of Christ
Swiftly fade away into the night
Nothing but ruins of ancient splendor
Christianity since long forgotten

I have read the signs of the burning stars
Order turns into chaos the light turns to night
I have read the signs of the dying sun
Order turns into chaos the light turns to night

Ensnared souls raped by evil
Molested in malevolence and malice
Overwhelmed by fear and anxiety
Slowly turning into afterlife dimension

I have read the signs of the burning stars
Order turns into chaos the light turns to night
I have read the signs of the dying sun
Order turns into chaos the light turns to night

The dying light of Christ
Swiftly fade away into the night
Nothing but ruins of ancient splendor
Christianity since long forgotten
