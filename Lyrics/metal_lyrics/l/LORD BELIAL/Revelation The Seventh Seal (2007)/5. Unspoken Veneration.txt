As daylight slowly fades into the hours of darkness
Dimness is rising from the depths of night
Demonic essence in this evil realm rule, rule forever more
Sinister might in this glorious black light

Spellbound by the shadow side of life
Silent reverence of this glorious night
Darkness descends and shadows emerge
Obscurity is slowly consuming all light

Acts of malice and sinful mischief
Dark pleasure and nocturnal desire longing for the dark hours
Words in ancient tongue is uttered
The gathering for unholy rites is set in this night

Spellbound by the shadow side of life
Silent reverence of this glorious night
Darkness descends and shadows emerge
Obscurity is slowly consuming all light
