Feeling the autumn rain
Walking into the night
The coldest fog embracing me

I don't belong to this time
I don't feel good about people
I'm totally out of this world.
And everything that kept me lucid gone

I'm The lord of the void
Decadent in my disillusion

I could lie down to never wake
Just going to my endless dark
