Is this the end?
Alone and empty as always
Beyond the tales
Beyond the life

I can remember you
Looking the night rain through the window
Inside of my dark mind
I can remember your eyes

You filled the void.
Who dwelt within me
And now in his sad departure
I was thrown into an endless void

This my final journey
Like a ghost burning
I going like a winter day
Finally, we will die!
