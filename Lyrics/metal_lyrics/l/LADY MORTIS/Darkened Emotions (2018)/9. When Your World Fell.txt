The rain still fallin'
the clouds in sadness cry
immortal sentries of darkness

Runs hate in my heart
I'm wandering between dead souls
With the frozen and fixed eyes

Rotten mind in insanity
Looking the sharp tip knife
Without fear to hurt me deeply

On a dry tree
A hanging rope
Waitin' a body for the coldest moonlight

My tears of frozen blood
my dear death around me
When your world fell

My world also fell
I return to nature
Cold and dark like my heart
