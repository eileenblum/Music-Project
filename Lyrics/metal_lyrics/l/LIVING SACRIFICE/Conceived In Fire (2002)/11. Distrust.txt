How Could You Know
Running In Circles With Your Eyes Wide Open
It's Not Enough For You To Hear Me Say Things Don't Have To Be This Way
Mental Ascent Will Give You Nothing
Nothing
Bitterness can Become Your Epidemic
Don't Let It Go Away Only You Can Make This Change
Delusion Is An Epidimic
Your Grip
Your Grip Is Firm
Casting Words Into Empty Lakes
Would You Rather Be Blind
Don't Let It Go Away Only You Can Make This Change
