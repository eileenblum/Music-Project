The Name Across Your Chest Means Nothing To Me
The Things You Have Don't Make A Man Complete
Living Life In A Box To Attain
Insipid Life In A Box To Attain
I've Seen The Way In Which I Should Go
Darkened By the Flash Of Light So False As To Blind
The Fad Is Fleeting
Crawling On Your Hands And Knees You've Shown Us The Beautiful Things
All The Best At Your Grasp, Facade Is Complete
This Plow Is Hard And Rough
My Back Breaks Under The Yoke That Has Attached
That Has Attached
It Was All A Lie, It Was All A Lie
The Way That Seems Right
All The World Is For Sale
Crawling On Your Hands And Knees
As The World Is For Sale
You've Shown Us The Beautiful Things
All The World Is For Sale
All The Best At Your Grasp
All The World Is For Sale
It Was All A Lie
It Was All A Lie
It Was All A Lie
The Way That Seems Right
