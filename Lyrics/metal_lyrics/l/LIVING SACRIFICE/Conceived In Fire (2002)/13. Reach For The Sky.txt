Who am I to question
Every day to understand
This precious beginning
Now fading, passing
This is the feel of sadness
Where will solace find me?
Where will peace begin?
Where will peace begin?
I have the call to be true
Find a way for you
The peace be inside
Follow safely home
In my God, in His smile,
Nothing is impossible
Every day brings an awesome hope
Grace will lead the way
And joy will follow
My heart leaps at the sound of Your voice
Calling my name
And You are so perfect
In every way
A testimony of creation
Beautiful is Your Name
I can't wait to see Him when I wake
Fresh and new
Simple and true
Formed by mercy
Formed by grace
Earth and sky
In Your eyes
Blessed
Pure
You're more than I deserve
You're my blessing
You're my wisdom
You're my freedom
You're my mission
I live for His glory
