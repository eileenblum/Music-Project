Flicker Inside
I've Seen The End My Friend
Cannot Continue In This Life
Abide In the Promises Told
Abide In The Promises Proven
Abide In The Promises Told, Abide In
Fan the Spark Of Hope
All Is Not Lost Here
I Saw The Outcome Once Before
So Distant It Seems So Long Ago, He's Still Alive
Intercession So Strong
Fan The Flame, So Close Now
Awaken The Strength, Internal
Write It Down, Make It Plan
I Saw The End Once Before
You Were There With Your Heart In Your Hand Outstretched
Shedding This Darkness
With Every Glance To The Sky
The Fire Is Revealing These Walls, Heart Twisting
Turning, Faithful, Sleepless, Faithful
But Now I Can Feel
But Now I Can Taste The Air Of Freedom
Ripping Through Moving Walls
Ripping Down This Structure
The Air Of Freedom Ripping Through Me
Write It Down, Make It Plan
I Saw The End Once Before
You Were There With Your Heart In Your Hand Outstretched
Shedding This Darkness
With Every Glance To The Sky, The Fire Is Revealing
