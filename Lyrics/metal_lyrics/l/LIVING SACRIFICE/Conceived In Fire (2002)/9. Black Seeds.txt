Beauty Blessed, All Confess, Undenied
Except Inside, Black Seeds Of Jealousy
Forced Inside, Forced Inside
At Such A Tender Age
Irreparable Psychosis Set In Motion
Joy Of Life And Love
Sucked Out By The Words Of The World
Colliding Your Worlds, Colliding The Blackness Inside
Manifest itself, Hate And Pride
Dispelled By God's Love Overtime
Forgiveness, The Mirror Lies
Conditioning Seeds Of Jealousy
Dispelled By God's Love
Peace Becomes Real To Me
This Blackness Inside
Manifest Itself In Hate And Pride
Dispelled By God's Love Overtime
Forgiveness Landslide
