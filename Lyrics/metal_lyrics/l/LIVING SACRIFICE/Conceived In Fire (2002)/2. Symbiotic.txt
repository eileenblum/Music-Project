Symbiotic, Conceived In Fire, Panic Strike
I Cannot Breathe, Piercing Me
Conscience Deep, Consuming Like
Embrace this Heat, Like Love
Complete In Me To See What I Could Not See
This Life Inside, Symbiotic
Conceived In Fire
Amniotic Suspension
Heart Rate Rhythmic
Surrounded By Sound Blood
Nourished, Blood Nourished
This Union By Love Destroys The Pain And Changes Everything
This Life Inside, Symbiotic
Conceived In Fire
Waves of Emotion
This Union By Love Destroys The Pain
This Union By Love Changes Everything
This Life Inside, Symbiotic
Conceived In Fire
Symbiotic
