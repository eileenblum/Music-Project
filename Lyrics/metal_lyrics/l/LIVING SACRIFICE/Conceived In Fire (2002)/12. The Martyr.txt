The Life And Blood Of God
Poured Out
This Is My Home
Cannot Turn Away
Dedication And Sacrifice
So Many Who Knew Before
Killed And Tortured
How Did You Breathe
What Did You See
Your Blood Testifies Of Your Witness
Moving Toward The Guillotine
Eviscerate By The Execution
Burning At The Stake Of Faith The Witness Laid Out For All To Obtain
Moving Toward The Guillotine
Eviscerate By The Execution
Burning At The Stake Of Faith
The Witness Laid Out For All To Obtain
The Sacrifice Is Mine
