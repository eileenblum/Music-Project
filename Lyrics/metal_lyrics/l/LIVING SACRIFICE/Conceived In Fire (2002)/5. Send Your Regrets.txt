Incidental Consequences
Growing Larger By The Second
Things I've Said, Things I've Done Out Of Ignorance
I Cursed The Son
Passive Resistance, Passive Resistance
Sown In Ignorance
If I had Known The Path I Took I Could Have Told The Stupid Links To Past Mistakes
Take A Flying Leap Into Your Fate
I Was Wrong For Thinking I Could Not Prevail
Kept My Mouth Shut For Too Long
This Is Not What I Agreed Upon
Passive Resistance, Passive Resistance
Believed The Lies I Can't Repeat This Possession Of Hatred
Defeat, Passive Resistance, Passive Resistance
