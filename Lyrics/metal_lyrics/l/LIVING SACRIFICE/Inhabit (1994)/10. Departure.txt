Altered state of mind induced by terror
Depression, placed out of consciousness
Most profound betrayal
Most painful revelation
Dissociated memories
Provoke trapped anguish
Related sensation produce fear decades later
Most profound betrayal
Most painful revelation
Cease the entanglement from future abuse
Embark on a search, walk in forgiveness

[Luke 11:4, John 20:23]
