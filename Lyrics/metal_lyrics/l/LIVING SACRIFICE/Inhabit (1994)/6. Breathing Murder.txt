Breathing murder upon the early church
Destruction, the new faith to hurt
Fueled by zeal, a twisted perception
Creating disorder, a morbid obsession
Profession of faith to persecute
From heaven a voice, journey refute
Falling to the ground
To arise without sight
Holy Spirit fill, falling scales from smite
Conspiracy to kill, voice of conversion
Speaking freely, a bold proclamation

[Acts 8.9, Galations 1:11-24]
