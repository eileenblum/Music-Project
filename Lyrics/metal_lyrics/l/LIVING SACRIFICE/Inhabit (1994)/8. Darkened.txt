Enduring a steady assault to maintain civilization
Violent society illustrates the industrialized nation
Godless (act of)
Environment (predation)
Commited by the dark side of the human condition
Defending attempt, separation
Spiritual awakening, regression
Removal of morality, ways of the Godless harken
Foolish hearts have become darkened
Emotional experiment, intellectual dishonesty
Viewing existent that sustains
Values entrenched in tradition shall remain

[Romans 1:21-23]
