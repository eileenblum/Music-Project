Faith has blessed, faith has saved
Faith has healed, faith has justified
Being sure of what is hoped for
Certain of what is unseen
Faith overcomes, faith is sincere
Faith as a shield
Faith as rightousness
Being sure of what is hoped for
Certain of what is unseen
Faith in the Father, faith is the Son
Faith in the Spirit
Faith should be revealed

[2 Corinthians 4:18, Hebrew 11]
