Praise the Lord, God Almighty
The praise of Christ enters our hearts
Holy nation never to part
Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain
To receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honour, glory, and praise
Inhabit our praise o'Lord
Encircle us with Your presence
Praise the Lord, God Almighty
Who is Who was
He's taken great power
And has begun to reign
Inhabit our praise o'Lord
Encircle us with Your presence
