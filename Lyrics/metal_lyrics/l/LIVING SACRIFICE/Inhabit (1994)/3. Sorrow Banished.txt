According to His promise
New Earth, Heaven descends
God with humanity now
Encampment means
Death vanquished, sorrow banished
Overcome to inherit
Reside in God's splendour
Glory, honour, brought in
Nothing impure to enter
Death vanquished, sorrow banished
Lord God Almighty
(The) Lamb is the temple
Divine descension, Divine exclusion
Death vanquished, sorrow banished

[Revelations 21]
