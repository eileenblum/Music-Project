To provide Christ the entrance
Forsaking the empty way of life
Sure of the Spirit's fulfillment
And absence of strife
God's child of the incorruptible seed, in which the world abides
Firmly rooted, established in faith, overflowing praise arises
Existing in Christ's presence
Reaching the depths of compassion
Center of self, overtaken discipline, motivated ambitions
Confidence in His power, wisdom
And goodness within reach
More than a conqueror, established to the end
Above, not beneath
Reconciled by God
Ministry of reconciliation
Redeemed from the oppressor, escape the corruption
Confidence in His power, wisdom
And goodness within reach
More than a conqueror, established to the end
Above, not beneath
Participationg in the diving nature
Continuing to grow
In wisdon and stature
Confidence in His power, wisdom and goodness
Within reach, more than a conqueror
Established to the end
Above, not beneath

[Deuteronomy 28:13, Corinthians 1:3, 2:5]
