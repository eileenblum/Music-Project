Divided structure cannot regain
Lack on insight, spiritual strain
Disrupting thoughts, strife is forbidden
Ignorant faith divisions will weaken
Christ wisdom maturity
Messengers assemble unit
Acknowledge the spirits indwelling
Loss of purpose, false profession
Unbelief of different foundations
Divided structre not ro remain
Christ wisdom maturity
Messengers assemble unit
Acknowledge the spirits indwelling
Enduring truth, exposure of reason
Bring the lost out of suffering
Oneness with God, social peace
Divine knowledge to increase

[Luke 11:17, 1 Corinthians 1:10, 3:16-17]
