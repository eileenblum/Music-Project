In the shadow
Power no foe can withstand
Angels lifting up as the Lord commands
Under His wings shall be found refuge and fortress
Not to fear the terror that stalks in the darkness
In accessible, secret
Place of the Most High
Observe the wicked
Punishment, justify
Dwelling in Christ
(No) Evil shall befall
With long life
Salvation enthrall
Spiritual concerns, consent of humanity
In His spirit and purpose, liberating entry
Particular gloom effected, closed hesitation
Not enchanted by superstitions impressions
Not to fear in the darkness
In the shadow, refuge and fortress

[Psalm 91]
