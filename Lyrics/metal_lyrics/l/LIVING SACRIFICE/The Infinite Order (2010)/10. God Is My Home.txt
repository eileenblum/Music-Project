Abandoned â Left for dead
Kept outside, ostracized
Unwanted in your eyes
Cut me off, thrown aside

Is this why I was born?
Is this what I come from?
This world has been lost long ago
God is my home

Estranged, bastard I am
Never had the reasons why
God has taken me in
Healed my wounds, loved me in my sin

Is this why I was born?
Is this what I come from?
This world has been lost long ago
God is my home

God has taken the one you never wanted
My home â God is my home
