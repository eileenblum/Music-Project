[featuring guest vocals by David Bunton of The Showdown]

At first site, dreams fulfilled
You were love and love was the answer
A covenant, bound by words
A covenant bound by blood

Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your tongue is the spear
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your secret is no more

A door was opened â the other was un-shut
My heart withering every secret
I have looked into the room
I have seen Judas

A serpent's day and they feasted
Your dream was eaten
Your heart has become a grave for robbers
Love turned to hate â justified by fate

Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your tongue is the spear
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your secret is no more

A serpent's day and they feasted
Your dream was eaten
I looked in the room â she was gone
The world has changed
My heart has remained

A serpent's day and they feasted
Your dream was eaten
Your heart has become a grave for robbers
Love turned to hate â justified by fate

Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your tongue is the spear
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your secret is no more
