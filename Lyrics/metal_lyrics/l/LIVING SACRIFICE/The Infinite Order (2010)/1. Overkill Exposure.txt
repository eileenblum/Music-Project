I watched them murder and kill
Lot against the destroyed will
I watched a man ripped to shreds
Stench of rot does not offend
Create a theme, sell it how
Promiscuous, no consequence
Think of ways to shock us now
Good luck, I've seen it all

I will pay for this death and destruction
Just to know such things exist
I will pay for this death and destruction
Knowledge of evil paralysis
Overkill exposure

Cannibalistic destruction
Fanatical debauchery
Glorified infidelity
Show me death, show me lies
Show me unthinkable darkness
Programmed perversion of the worst kind

Show me death, show me lies
Show me unthinkable darkness
Show me death, show me lies

I will pay for this death and destruction
Just to know such things exist
I will pay for this death and destruction
Knowledge of evil paralysis
Overkill exposure

Guard my heart, guard my will
Think of ways to shock us now
Guard my heart, guard my will
Keep your death and lies

Guard my heart, guard my will
Think of ways to shock us now
Guard my heart, guard my will
Keep your death and lies
