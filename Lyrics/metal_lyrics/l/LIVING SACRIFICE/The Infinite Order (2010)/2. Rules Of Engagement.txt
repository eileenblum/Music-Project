[featuring guest vocals by David Bunton of The Showdown]

Expectations of actions â that conform
Foreign beliefs â put in position to be killed
You have to go â you have to fight
There's no one else that's capable
No one else would even dare

Put your life on the line without a word
Silent and stealth
Just like you were trained to kill

Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide

Twenty yards and counting
The enemy rears his head
Black eyes glaring hate
In his heart

Blood and sweat mixed with earth
Bloody mess, stench of death
Blood and sweat mixed with earth
Searing flesh is what you're worth

Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide
Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide

Engage...

Sent to defend
Trained to kill by the ones who called you an animal

Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide
Your hands are tied
You're gonna die
By decisions made in someone else's mind
