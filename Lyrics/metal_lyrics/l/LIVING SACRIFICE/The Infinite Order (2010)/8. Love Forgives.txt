Through the raging gates of hell
He has shown redemption
He has opened up the skies
And made up for my losses
Who can make dark the purpose of Yahweh?
Who can take away the hand of compassion?

The air is blessed and my house is full
I was destroyed but Your hand brought beauty
My sin had overcome me but Your hand brought mercy
I am lifted by her love
Through the cracks of my despair
Each day is made new in Your hands forever

This is a call to the weak
These are the words we proclaim
Piece by piece I have gained a part of myself
My dreams are one again
Let me take you
Beauty â Your majesty
Love forgives travesty

This is a call to the weak
These are the words we proclaim
Piece by piece I have gained a part of myself
My dreams are one again
Let me take you
Beauty â Your majesty
Love forgives travesty
Love forgives
Love forgives
Love forgives
