You have a new way
Is it a better way?
Once I saw you proclaim
Now there's slight disdain
Why keep that title, what has changed? Is God so different?
Why keep that title, what has changed? Is He not the same?

Love is present, grace abounds
What happened here? Was the world so enticing?
Denial is treachery hard to reconcile
Call it for what it really is
Don't make excuses
Call it for what it really is
Go ahead apostasy

Tepid waters do not run
Stagnation breeds disease
Flies surround
Multiply maggot parasites
Why keep that title? Why redefine?
Lord of the flies
Apostasy, Apostasy

Love is present, grace abounds
What happened here? Was the world so enticing?
Denial is treachery hard to reconcile
Call it for what it really is
Don't make excuses
Call it for what it really is
Go ahead apostasy

Do not conform to one man
God is clear on who you are
Love, grace and mercy are there
Do not pretend apostasy
