Infamy â you lost your way again
This was the day, the day that you resigned
Infamy â this was not His design

I was yours, you were mine, cannot describe
I was yours, you were mine, this pain inside
Now I've turned to look â only a shadow remains
My land has been laid to waste
A drop of hope is all I taste

This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my heart
This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my death
No hope for return
You have brought infamy
No hope for return
Speaking grace solemnly

Depression â sets in
The serpent â stakes its claim
Losing faith â what it means to be alive
The shadows all around me dance for sorrow

I was yours, you were mine, cannot describe
I was yours, you were mine, this pain inside
Now I've turned to look â only a shadow remains
My land has been laid to waste
A drop of hope is all I taste

This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my heart
This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my death
No hope for return
You have brought infamy
No hope for return
Speaking grace solemnly

This is a reckoning (reckoning)
This is a reckoning (reckoning)
This is a reckoning (reckoning)
This is a reckoning
