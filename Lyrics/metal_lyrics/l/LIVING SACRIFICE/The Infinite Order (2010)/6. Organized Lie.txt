[featuring guest vocals by Drew Garrison of Little Rock Police Department / Ecomium]

Subvert the conscious mind of us all
Become the one who is the fraud
Deny the evil that pervades
Deny the sin that fuels the way

Pull down the blinders, rip down the shades
See the world as it has been made
The laws of life point the way
The ordering of every thing

Deny the conscience of righteousness
Paint broad strokes of piousness
Everyone believes in something, everyone believes
Just because you don't call it God does not mean belief's not involved
Just because you don't call it God does not mean belief's not involved

Random - organized lie
Random - organized lie

Pull down the blinders, rip down the shades
See the world as it has been made
The laws of life point the way
The ordering of every thing

Random - organized lie
Random - organized lie
