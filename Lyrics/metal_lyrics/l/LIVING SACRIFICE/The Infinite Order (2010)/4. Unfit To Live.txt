Product of some enlightenment
Cheapening a life once lived
The feeble and degenerate
Deemed unworthy living burdens
Social engineering
Genetic playground of the elite

Rationalize these thoughts and processes
Sterilize â Conclude who can live and die
Selective breeding â Racial hygiene
The extreme survival of social Darwin
Social engineering
Genetic playground of the elite

Who decides who lives and dies?
What is the cost of life?
The intellect of a Mini-God

Selective breeding â Racial hygiene
No compassion in this process
Only pseudoscientific notions

Who decides who lives and dies?
What is the cost of life?
Who decides who lives and dies?
