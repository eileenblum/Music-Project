[Hidden Bonus Track]Wisdom â keeps you safe
Discretion â opposes sin innate
His Truth â guides and reveals
The One Sacrificed â striped to heal

Protection â only comes from God
Entrusted â to provide His love
Responsible â for this heart
Impartation â a Grace on fire

You have a part â of my heart
You have a part â of my heart

You have my heart always forever
You have my heart always forever... forever

I would die to protect you, but I cannot
I would die to protect you, gift of God
