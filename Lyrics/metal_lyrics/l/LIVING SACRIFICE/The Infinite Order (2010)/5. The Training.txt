Broken down one by one
They'll take your pride and crush it
The fall that comes is real, by pure degradation
Amputate â Humiliate
Who can take this punishment?
Create something new â A warrior where there once was nothing

Destroy the body and mind â Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind â Today is a good day to die

(Broken mind) â Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit â (Rise) Rise

Destruction comes only once in a lifetime
Cannot be great in your mind
This is the time to say your last prayer
If you desire peace, then prepare for war

Destroy the body and mind â Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind â Today is a good day to die
Destroy the body and mind â Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind â I am ready for mine

(Broken mind) â Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit â (Rise) Rise

(Broken mind) â Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit â (Rise) Rise
Prepare for war â Rise
Prepare for war â And rise
