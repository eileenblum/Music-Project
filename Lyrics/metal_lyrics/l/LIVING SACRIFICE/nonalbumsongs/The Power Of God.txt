["In Memoriam" "best of" compilation 2005]

The outstretched arms, of one word, of one breath (one breath).
The existence is spoken (the existence is spoken), the existence will attest.
A bond has been made, a plan put in motion
to reconcile and make new, the ultimate sacrifice of your flesh.

Self lust will kill, a heart towards God will change... destiny.
Power, unleashed on this void. Onslaught, the only plan of this kind.
This is something that cannot subside.

The dawn of this day, a decision is made to know and proclaim.
The dawn of this day, a decision is made to know and proclaim.
The power of God, the power of God is alive, is alive, is alive.
