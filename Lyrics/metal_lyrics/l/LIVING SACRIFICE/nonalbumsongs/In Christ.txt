["In Memoriam" "best of" compilation 2005]

Birthright by the hand of God. I am he, chosen and called.
I have answered and understand. The gift of God has been given by his Son.

I am in Christ, the Son of God. I am in Christ, no longer condemned.
I am in Christ, the Son of God. I am in Christ, resurrected.

Who can be against me, who can compromise?
The power of He is resting, I will glorify.

Laid bare, before your eyes. It can only come this way.
The price is paid, by His blood. All I ask is who am I?

I am in Christ, the Son of God. I am in Christ, no longer condemned.
I am in Christ, the Son of God. I am in Christ, resurrected. (resurrected, resurrected)

The right to live, the right to breathe. The right to be and to believe.
God has come, the time has come to take hold of the promise, of the promise, of the promise.
The time has come to take hold of the Blood, of the Blood, of the Blood, of the Blood...
