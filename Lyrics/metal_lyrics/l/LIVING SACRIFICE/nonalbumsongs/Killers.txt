["In Memoriam" "best of" compilation 2005]

Things we cannot quite conceive, powers of geography.
Darkness so blinding, haunting, manipulating.
Assorted delights will abound, in a land hidden from sound.
Authority thatâs temporary, princes of hell in their playground.

Killers, you are killers. Killers, you are killers. Killers...

Madmen who hold us hostage, nightmares are manifesting bondage.
Taunt me, harassing, ripping through.
The separation of whatâs true, lie in waiting, overtake.
All is forsaken, there is another way.

Killers, you are killers. Killers, you are killers. Steal, Kill, Destroy.

Killers, you are killers. Killers, you are killers. Steal, Kill, Destroy.
