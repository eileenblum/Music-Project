Humanity gave place to death's origin
All unrighteous, none without sin
Atonement, atonement
Sin gives in return to death, God bestows reconciliation
From death Christ arose, believe and announce salvation
Atonement, atonement
Declared righteous to any that proclaim
Invoking Christ, never, never to see shame
Atonement, atonement
