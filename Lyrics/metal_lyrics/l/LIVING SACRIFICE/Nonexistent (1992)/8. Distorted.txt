Distorted reality
Truth behind, not to see
Focus of life means twisting negative
Draining deeper fears by a quest to live
Suffering down perpetual destruction
Pulling ties of morbid inspiration
Confession of words, life or death is heard
Not demanding any believe, consequence received
Spoken words, subtract belief
Enter minds, producing feelings of grief
Exaggerated expression regarded as vain
Unjust illusions of severe pain
Surrounding the faithless
Who dwell hopeless
Confession of words, life or death is heard
Not demanding any believe, consequence received
Demolish, dark imagination
Satan's demise, eternal realization
The keys of hell and death, in Christ's hands are held
The wickedness that opposed, have forever failed
