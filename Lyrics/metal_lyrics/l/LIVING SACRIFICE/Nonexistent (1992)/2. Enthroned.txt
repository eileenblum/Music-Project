The sacrifice of praise, setting free
Being a undispensable necessity
The splender of Christ's holiness
Abound in, filled with righteousness
Uplifted hands to enthrone
The chosen and precious conerstone
O Lord, a resting place, arise
O Lord to be forever glorified
Undying worship, a continued offering
Christ above all, wisdom exalting
O Lord, a resting place, arise
O Lord to be forever glorified
