Of temptation completed cycle, seducer of humanity
Elements unfurl darkness excruciating sanity
Blasphemed, not to deplore
Loathsome spirits perform signs
To assemble and embrace war
Allied evil powers victory incomplete
Last judgement destiny experience Satan's defeat
Seized and overpowered bound is the serpent
After millennium of abyss released from confinement
Nations deceived, wonder guide, armies assume
Saints encircled, execute judgement, fire that consumes
Allied evil powers victory incomplete
Last judgement destiny experience, Satan's defeat
