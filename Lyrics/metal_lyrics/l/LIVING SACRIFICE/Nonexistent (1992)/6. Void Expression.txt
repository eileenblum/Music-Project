Inward lapse mutates transgression
Outward appearance is void expression
Steps towards disorientation
Are frozen by the distraction
Veil that covers sight turns black
As numb emotions ministers lack
With ever increasing glory unveiled
The will of the spirit inhaled
Awaken the unconscious emotions
Christ, the center of new devotions
