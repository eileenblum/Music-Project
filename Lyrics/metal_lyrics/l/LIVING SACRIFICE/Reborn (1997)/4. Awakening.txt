Awakening has taken place in me,
Breathe in the newness of life
Drink freely new wine
Awaken from stagnant,
Passiveness broke free
Constrictive casualness
The dawn has come,
We must move on
Steadfast, faithfulness,
Put off, laziness
Wake up, wake up
Awaken from sleep,
Open your eyes, receive
Healed of crippling lethargy
Our spirits no longer
Reek of sleep
Through prayer we've entered
In the throne room
The will of God
Awaken from stagnant broke free
The dawn has come,
We must move on
Steadfast putoff casual
Wake up, wake up
