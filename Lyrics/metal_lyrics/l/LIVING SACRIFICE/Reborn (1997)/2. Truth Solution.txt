Breath of God released faith
Creates all life perfect plan
Sin invades
Separates man from God
The fallen state
Lamb of God sacrifice fulfills
All law with sinless life
Love beyond all that's known
God himself bore our sin
Jesus truth solution,
Truth solution, the only solution
Before all time his plan was made
To give free will yet show the way
To give his son in our place,
To die, to rise forever reign
Beware deception,
All highs fade except God
Deluded path
Confront to blind eyes
From the, from the truth
The choice is free to all
Rejection receives hell
There is no other way
Acceptance eternal life in
Jesus, truth solution,
Truth solution, the only solution
