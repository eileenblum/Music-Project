Sellout, sellout, selfish lust
Gone, no time for games,
Free will reigns
I will to surrender,
I will take my cross,
My flesh subjected,
My spirit rise
Focus, focus,
Straightway on my God,
No more needless,
Cares of temporal
No more deception,
Subtile thoughts,
Focus straightway on eternal
My spirit cries out to you God,
To live is Christ, to die gain
I will not build again,
Things which I've destroyed
I will not
Make myself transgressor
Hay and stubble
Will burn away
Only God, only God remains
My spirit cries out to you God,
To live is Christ, to die gain
