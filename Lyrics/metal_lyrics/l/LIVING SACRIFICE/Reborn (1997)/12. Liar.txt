Worthless, want to, be God,
Loser imitation
Fallen from all grace,
Deceitful lying beast your bound
Lord of maggots, we rebuke you,
Devil evil no authority
Whatever's bound on earth,
Will in heaven be bound
In Jesus' name
Enemy of God every knee will bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus Christ is Lord
You're already dead,
Be seen for what you are
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Enemy of God every knee will bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus Christ is Lord
