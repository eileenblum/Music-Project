Fear get away from me
Doubt has no place in me
Seduction of death will go
Intermittent thoughts of past life
I do not know that man
Anymore nevermore
Weight has lifted,
bondage is broken
That yoke destroyed
I've nothing more to do with it
Peace deep within I'm set free
I have become something else
My spirit breathes freely again
That yoke destroyed
I've nothing more to do with it
No longer tormented
No longer
