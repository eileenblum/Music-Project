Origin of consciousness,
Fat acid rhetoric
Promulgate me mentally
Twisted to no deity
Interpret your reality,
Sell to me no absolutes
Moral relativity,
This world is false
Something more
I have a soul
Of not flesh and bone
I have a Spirit
That cries out to know God
The speculation seems so vague
It does not fulfill
What's real inside of me
Don't pacify spiritual
Teach me to be me in Christ
Origin of consciousness
Spiritual
I am not what meets the eye
