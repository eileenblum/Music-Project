Spirit fall on this land,
Convicting power cleansing man
Reveal your truth to blind eyes,
Rip the scales from their sight
Anointing fall on this place

Arise, be made new
In the fullness of His truth
Repent and believe
In His strength you'll be free
Holy Spirit be Thee praised

Anointing fall on this place
This place
Anointing fall on this place
Spirit of God
We give you praise,
We give you praise,
We give you praise,
We give you...
