It begins, exhume, resurrect,
Crucify again
His flesh not yours,
His strength not yours
His death was your rebirth
Why embrace a lie,
Why refuse the Spirit
Withdraw from vital union
Enslaved, enslaved
Do not open wide
The door that leads to destruction
Don't Resurrect
What has been killed
Truth laid out, castdown pride
I grasp for life, I embrace God
Crucify again my flesh not dead
His strength not mine
His death is rebirth,
Rebirth, rebirth
Do not open wide
The door that leads to destruction
Don't resurrect
What has been killed
