Do what you want to do,
Say what you want to say to me
I know what you'd like
To think of me
This is not real it can't be real
This thing I feel
You're threatening
You're threatening
How can I not hate you, hate you
How can I not be free, be free
I know deep down inside
How God reveals himself
I know deep down inside
To know him I must kill pride
Why do you care so much for me,
What's in this for you
Why can't selfishness rule you
Like everybody else
Let go pride, let go pride,
Cannot deny, cannot deny
This thing I feel, I feel inside
How God reveals himself
I know deep down inside
To know him I must kill pride
