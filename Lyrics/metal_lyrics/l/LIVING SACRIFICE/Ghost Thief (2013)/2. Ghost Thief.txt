There is no cheat
It comes as the ghost thief
Quick and fleeting
There is no guarantee for tomorrow
We are not home
We are passing through
Try and hold on as we may
Matter will not sustain
I will proclaim
The end is not the end

Escape
Itâs just a vapor
Escape
A temporal list
Escape â escape
There is a realm
Escape â escape
Where time does not exist

Contained in a whisper
This is all I see
This is just a dream
What is to be
Cannot resist
Nothing more
Nothing less
Nothing else
Nothing more
Nothing less
Nothing else
Will attest

Escape
Itâs just a vapor
Escape
A temporal list
Escape â escape
There is a realm
Escape â escape
Where time does not exist

Escape
Itâs just a vapor
Escape
Where time does not exist
