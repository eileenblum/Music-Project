Just a fascination of what lies beyond
A life thatâs free
Under mind responsibility
My greatness is wide
Love of self, the lie
Curse the scrutiny
Embrace the thought inside

I will, manipulate
You will capitulate
What youâve given me is a path perverted
Adapted, disjointed philosophies

Emotional dependence
My grasp is relentless

Perfected in mind
Planted and instilled
This formation of a dark temptation
The ease of it all
Disease enthralled
This fantastic dream
Subject to a darker scheme

I will manipulate
You will capitulate
What youâve given me is a path perverted
Adapted, disjointed philosophies

Emotional dependence
My grasp is relentless

Your love becomes inverted
A path becomes perverted
I watched them drown
Under a clear blue sky
Weighted with guilt
I watched them die
