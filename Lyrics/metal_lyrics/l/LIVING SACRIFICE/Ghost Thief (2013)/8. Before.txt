I am a fraud without you
I am a lie without you
On my own I fend for myself
No consideration of anything else

I am drawn, I am

This is my skeleton
This is my skin
I will remove this disguise
I will remove this mask you met me in
The day we met I wanted nothing
A selfish being, blind and seething
Compelled, I am drawn to you
By God, I am saved by you
You pierced this conscious
You broke this shell
You planted conviction
Where there was only hell

Compelled, I am drawn
By God, I am

This is my skeleton
This is my skin
I will remove this disguise
I will remove this mask you met me in
