Made yourself into more than a man
The anointed one by your own hand
Speech is perfect, masked vulgarity
Sight is straight, dark rigidity
All is copacetic
Projected, unaccepting

Everyone is hurt
Everyone is broken
Everyone is bleeding
Inside
Iâve lived enough to know
Everyone has suffered, suffered
Inside, inside

Who would even need to see?
Who would even seem to care?
What you see is shallow
Who would even need to see?
Who would even seem to care?
There is no room, no room for despair

That mask is so deceptive
Despite this life
Try and hide, try and hide
From down low, so much darkness
Casts a shadow on your broken halo
Iâve lived enough to know
So much darkness
Seeds are sown

Everyone is hurt
Everyone is broken
Everyone is bleeding
Inside
Iâve lived enough to know
Everyone has suffered, suffered
Inside, inside

Who would even need to see?
Who would even seem to care?
What you see is shallow
Who would even need to see?
Who would even seem to care?
There is no room, no room for despair

Everyone is hurt
Everyone is broken
Everyone is bleeding
Inside
Iâve lived enough to know
Everyone has suffered, suffered
Inside, inside
