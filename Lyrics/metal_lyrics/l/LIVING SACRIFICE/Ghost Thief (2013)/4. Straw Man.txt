I am not who you think I am
I am not who you think I am
I am not who youâve made me to be, be, to be

My pedestal is decayed with sin
Collapsing all around me
With all your expectations
With all your preconceptions

The straw man
I am, not called to be
Your idea, of how you see me
I am, not called to be
Your idea, of how you see me

I am not, I am not
In a place to pretend
In a place to pretend
To be a fake version of a man

The straw man
I am, not called to be
Your idea, of how you see me
I am, not called to be
Your idea, of how you see me

I am, not called to be
Your idea, of how you see me
I am, not called to be
Your idea, of how you see me
Not called to be, of how you see, how you see me
