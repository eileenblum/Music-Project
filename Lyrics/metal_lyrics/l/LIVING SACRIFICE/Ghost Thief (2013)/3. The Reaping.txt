A smile does the deal
No matter if itâs real
Insincere prayer
It will go nowhere

You pave the way
For that sorrowful day
Obtained all you want
A deathly law you sought
Forgotten covenant
Forgotten part of remnant
The words keep on changing
Double-minded rearranging
With a forked tongue
Shifting lines, your neck is hung
Oblivious to this life
God given, glorious heights
One kill does the deal
No matter if itâs real

You are reaping greed
You are reaping lust
Reaping covetous
Reaping apocalypse

You are reaping greed
You are reaping lust
Reaping covetous
Reaping apocalypse

You are reaping greed
You are reaping lust
Reaping covetous
Reaping apocalypse

You are reaping greed
You are reaping lust
Reaping covetous
Reaping, reaping, reaping apocalypse
