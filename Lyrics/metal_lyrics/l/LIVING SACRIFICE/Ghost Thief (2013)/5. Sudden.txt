You were here, just a moment ago
I saw your face
I never thought I would know
The emptiness of this place
I never thought I could comprehend
Absence that dug so deep
I never expected to bury you incomplete

You were the one who comforted
You were the one who told me
You were the one who made me live
Gave me this gift

Broken, broken
These bonds and mortal coils
Never to return, never again
Broken, broken
These bonds and mortal coils
Never to return, never again

You have seen the ocean
And the promised land
Beyond sight and sound
Where mortal dreams command
Universe unfolded
Glorious heavens shown
So expansive
Deep truths become known

I will endeavor to see you again
In the world that lies beyond
I will endeavor to see you again
Beyond this veil of sight

Broken, broken
These bonds and mortal coils
Never to return, never again
Broken, broken
These bonds and mortal coils
Never to return

Never to return, never to return
Never to return, never again
