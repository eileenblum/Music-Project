I am not the standard
No rule to be upheld
This was a set up
All intended to fail
Betrayed
Could not face the truth
Crushed innocence
Despised by this youth
Crushed innocence, despised

Failure is my companion
Mortal laws at play
Nothing in this union
Nothing but decay
What can be rebuilt
No way to break free
Every option of guilt
Submerged under this sea

Give unto me your sorrow
There is no way to break free
Give unto me your malice
Dark insecurity

Submerged under a mountain of loss
Figment of the psyche
The loss of what may be
Time may heal all wounds
Not when it reappears
Not when the scab is ripped open
Not when life is broken
No cross have I hung
No one I have healed
No wounds have I bled
That fate was sealed

Give unto me your sorrow
There is no way to break free
Give unto me your malice
Dark insecurity

I have taken
I have taken, your despair
I have taken
I have taken, your despair
