CUT DEEP, THE WOUND IS OPEN, INFECTION SETS IN 
WILL THIS BE MY LAST OF DOES THE CUT GET DEEPER? 
I CAN'T FEEL, WALKING WITH UNOPENED EYES 
LIES THAT BROUGHT ME HERE FADE AWAY 
MISPLACED THIS CURE, MISPLACED THIS HEART 
CAN'T FEEL FOR THE WOUND INSIDE OF ME 
HAND OF THE DEAD LAID IN STONE, SHAPE SHIFT TO CONCIEVE 
DROWNING IS EVIDENCE THAT FADING IS SLOWLY TAKING ROOT 
CAN'T FEEL FOR THE WOUND INSIDE 
HAND OF THE DEAD
