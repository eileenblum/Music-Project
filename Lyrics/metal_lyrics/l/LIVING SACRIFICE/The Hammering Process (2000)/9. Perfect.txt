LET IT TAKE HOLD 
WE HAVE PERVERTED, DESTROYED THE TRUTH 
EXCHANGED FOR A SLANT OR FICTION THAT FEEDS THE PART OF ME 
THAT WILL BECOME THE DARKEST PLACE OF ALL 
ONE THOUGHT, ONE WORD SPOKEN 
ALL OF THIS EXIST UNTO YOU 
IN EVERYTHING I BELIEVE AND SEE THAT CONFIRMS THE LOVE 
WE HAVE PERVERTED, DESTROYED THE TRUTH 
EXCHANGED FOR A FABRICATION 
THIS HOPE THAT LIES WITHIN EXPOSED FOR ALL TO SEE 
LET IT TAKE HOLD 
I CHOOSE A PERFECT WAY 
IN EVERYTHING I BELIEVE AND SEE THAT CONFIRMS THE LOVE 
CAN I RECIEVE THIS GIFT, NEVER CEASING? 
THIS HOPE THAT LIES WITHIN, LET IT TAKE HOLD
