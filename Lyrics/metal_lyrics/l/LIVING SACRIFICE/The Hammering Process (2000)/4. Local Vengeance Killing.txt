FOR THE CAUSE, MY TRIAL, MY JUDGMENT, MY RETRIBUTION 
A NEW MACHINE LEAVING ALL BEHIND 
MERCY WILL ONLY COMPLICATE 
FILL THE SPACE INSIDE, SHOOT TO KILL THE WOUNDED 
THE CALLOUSED TOUNGE 
MY AIM IS PRECISE, ARMED WITH MY OWN FAILURES, THE 
COST OF BEING YOU 
BRACE YOURSELF LIKE A MAN 
YOU FAIL TO QUALIFY, IT'S ONLY PERSONAL, JUST BEING... 
A NEW MACHINE, A NEW MACHINE MY AIM IS PRECISE, MY RETRIBUTION
