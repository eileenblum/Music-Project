BURN THE END AND FALL AWAY 
TRY TO LOOK THE BEST TO PORTRAY THIS DEATH 
THE AIR AROUND ME IS CLOUDY, SMELLS LIKE CANCER 
SEEMS LIKE MY NEED TO BE SOMETHING GOD'S NOT CALLED ME TO BE 
GIVE ME THAT FEELING, I'VE FOOLED MYSELF 
CONCERNED WITH PERCEPTION, CAN'T COME OFF LOOKING WEAK 
LEAST OF ALL WITH YOU 
IF I NEED THIS IMAGE TO BE ME 
THEN WHERE IS MY GOD ABLE TO SHINE THROUGH? 
BURN THE END, FALL AWAY 
LIGHT UP ANOTHER REPRESENTATION OF MY INSECURITY 
WHEN I STUMBLE, DON'T FOLLOW MY SMALL REBELLION 
CORRUPTION COLLAPSE 
COMPROMISE WILL BREED CORRUPTION
