SELF PERCEPTION OF THIS REASON 
STRIVE AGAINST THIS HEART THAT'S NEEDING 
ACCUSED BY THIS LUST OF FLESH AND DEATH WORLD 
BORN AGAIN... LIFE 
BORN AGAIN... PEACE 
BORN AGAIN... LOVE 
I AM NOT MY OWN 
CANNOT CONTAIN, DISASSOCIATE MY SORROW AND PAIN 
ALL DISTORTIONS OF HATE, DISTORTIONS OF GOD 
DISSECT, MASSACRE, DISSIPATE 
FALSE HOPE IN MAN 
FALSE FAITH IN MYSELF 
FALSE LIFE ADORNED IN DESTRUCTION 
FAILED LIFE IN DEATH ONCE RIPPED ME OPEN 
NOW DISSECT, MASSACRE
