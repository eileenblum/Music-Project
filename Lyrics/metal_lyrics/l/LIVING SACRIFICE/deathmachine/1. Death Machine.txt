Moving parts all collide
Force of nature fueled by pride
Gears of greed oiled by deceit
This machine keeps moving
Fake facade are these clothes
that I'll wear when they bury me
Cannot fool for another day
Cannot pretend that I got away

The death machine - steamrolls hate
The death machine - construction of fate
The death machine - never stops
The death machine - an end to a means
The death machine - never stops
The death machine is sin and I am he.

Imposter - hypocrites profess only words

The death machine - steamrolls hate
The death machine - construction of fate
The death machine - never stops
The death machine - an end to a means
The death machine - never stops
The death machine is sin and I am he.

Hallelujah - I've seen the light
Hallelujah - tie that knot extremely tight
Around my neck this rope feels tight
Jerk it hard pull it tight
Around my neck this rope feels right
I'm gonna see the bottom of the sea tonight
Hallelujah - I've seen the light
Hallelujah - I'm gonna be bottom of the sea tonight
