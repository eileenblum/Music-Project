Heated steel hammered straight
Unified Spirit speaks, implements of life
Destroyer of death
This blade is splattered with red
Symbolic of the spirit of death
This machine cannot take me down

Take my stand Unrelenting
Come and take it, if you think you can
This victory of mine, words that testify
Overcome by blood

Blood let, words are sharp and piercing
Sword of the Spirit cutting
Blood let, divine what's right through truth
Ripping off the scales that blind you

Take my stand Unrelenting
Come and take it, if you think you can
This victory of mine, words that testify
Overcome by blood

This blade is splattered red
This blade is splattered red
My words are sharp and piercing
My words are sharp and piercing

Take my stand Unrelenting
Come and take it, if you think you can
This victory of mine, words that testify
Overcome by blood

Come and take it, come and take it if you think you can.
I will fight, I will fight.
