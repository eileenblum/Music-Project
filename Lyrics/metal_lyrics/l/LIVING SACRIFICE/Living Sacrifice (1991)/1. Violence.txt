In the mind of mortal man
The vision is tainted red
Consumed by anger, provoked bye words
That should never been said
Now all this mind seems to harbor are misplaces aggressions
Once released, they will seek
Reaping the sadistic intentions
In this time and age that maintains no aspect of order
Hard to see are these lines in which many souls border
Visual assistance show life as a harsh reality
The bitter effect produced not approved by society

Read the words, hear Christ speak
Refrain from anger, revert the cheek
Withheld in compassion, not signs of the weak
Seek humility for blessed are the meek
