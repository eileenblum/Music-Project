The administration of a mystery
Death beingswallowed up in victory
From the grave the soul is redeemed
Death cannot entangle as it may have seemed
Christ's purpose and grace is disclosed
Being declared since the day he arose
From dwelling silence there is immunity
Annulling death he brought immortality

Instead of sorrow if the soul does yearn
Remain being filled with comfort having no grave concern

Not left abandoned in a grave of despair
Having turned from death away from the snare
Absence from body presence with the lord
Faithfulness reaping a righteous reward
