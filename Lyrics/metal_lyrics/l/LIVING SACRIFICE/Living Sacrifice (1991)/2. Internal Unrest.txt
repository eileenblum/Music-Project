Internal unrest, emotional decline
Cruelly overbearing, will confined
Future uncertain, past regrets
Temporal pain, not easy to forget
Mangled thoughts irrational actions
Overwhelmed amidst confusion
Cry for hope total despair
Reaching out who will care

Emotions will ascend by divine intervention
Oppressive misery on the brink of extinction

Oppressive misery irrational actions
Overwhelmed amidst confusion
Emotions will ascend by divine intervention
Mangled thoughts on the brink of extinction
