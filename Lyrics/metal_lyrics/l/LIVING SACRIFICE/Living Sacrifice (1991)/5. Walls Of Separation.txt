Not a mere perception, an acquaintance
Conscious of sin, access to repentance
Acquitted through faith by justification
God through Christ brings reconciliation
Divided in universal guilt
Under condemnation
Proceed to the doors of mercy
Through the walls of separation

Contrary to will a force ever present
Oral instinct condemns by strong intent
Freed from the law that sin enslaved
Nature of man, power is depraved

Exertion will not provide atonement
Man can escape the impending judgement
Fulfilled the purpose, designed to accomplish
Invoking Christ as Lord none shall perish
