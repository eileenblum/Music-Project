Being held fast by the cords of affliction
Subjected to mental infiltration
Conceived thought compromise obtained
Appealing to desires fatal if remain
Afflicted spirits
Under the authority
Christ proclaimed
Obstruction cease to be

Depraved aphrodisia wars against the soul
Fulfilling strategies of complete control
From the deep prcess of a darkened mind
Twistedly emerge images of this kind

Legions of the air on this journey they lead
Obsession inspired nurtures dormant
Trouble is presented by an unjust gain
Selfish ambitions that were plotted in vain
