Around their necks is tied a millstone
With sin the little ones were overthrown
Their sincere minds were led astray
Distracted by pure devotion to Christ way
A spirit is now at work in the disobedient
Neglected are the words of encouragement
Memories of forgiveness fade into oblivion
Casting themselves down into corruption
Continual indulgence in the spirit of impurity
Blinding their eyes from the truth of reality
The Lord is aware of their futile thoughts
Occupying the bones envy slowly rots
For season their conspiracy goes unseen but with
Immoral actions it's revealed unclean

Shamefully fall short of the expectations
Disgrace sets in with deep conviction

Whosoever covereth the errors of this path
Covers over multitude sin and death wrath

To public discrace Christ is constrained
Not by the ones who have faithfully remained
But for the lost brought back he will rejoice
Answering the cry of the still small voice
