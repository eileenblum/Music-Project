Insufficient supplication communion is abstained
Weary is the spirit as consideration drains
The duty of seeking peace is not being pursued
Plenty was promised agreement misconstrued
No obedience toward Christ every thought not held captive
Though possessing unfailing love these ways are disruptive
Appointed to bring the faith silent with desires
Unfaithful words oppress what the lord requires
Plans fail for a lack of council but many have advice
Resenting their correction exceed boundaries of the wise

Anorexia spiriatual unnoticed as it seems
Delivered by an adocate to justify its means
Walls of protection agreed to be contructed
Now begin to fall as wisdom is being abducted

Seeds have been cast falling on unfertile ground
Tolerating what is what is wrong conflict dies abound
Up against the knowledge of God arguments and pretension
Obedience fully secured and complete in submission
Elude those to assemble no to associate
Hidden is distress established able to dominate

Recipient of atrocity misfortune can arrive
Ushering in the presence only pacifies
Having the inermost being, subjecting it to starvation
A return to endurance prompted by this demonstration
