There is a voice that has gone forth
Proclaiming "Vengeance it is mine"
Prophetic truth sure to come
In the fullness of this time
Salvation produced the acquired
Absence for who had the belief
The unfortunate now remain
In an endless search for relief
The Lord's wisdom and his
Strength they utterly forsake
Insecurity of the darkness disaster will overtake
Falling unexpectedly never to withhold
Sudden Destruction, final separation
Fall of the wicked foretold

Harvest of the earth now takes place
Divine authority to remove the disgrace
Permission given the sickle is swung
Gathered together in the press they're slung
With great wickedness the vats overflow
Rising high, simulation of the flood
Return to ruin valley of blood
