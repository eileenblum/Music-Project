There is no justice in their path
The way of peace is not decerned
Mention Christ in effect
Stubbornly cacks will turn
Void of knowledge declining to understand
Scraps of information forcing knowledge ot expand
Dealing with ignorance
Realize patience through observing the tolerant
Exercise gentleness toward those who are ignorant
Dealing with ignorance

Despising wisdom fools mock
Show them mercy mixed with fear
Renew a mind dull inform
Never seeming insincere
With comprehension mystery are revealed
Value of the truth away once concealed

Truthful witness they persecute
Whispers petitions in warfare
Exposing requirements of the lord
For the ignorant to be award
No search is needed for what is found
Abstract theories hodling no position to what is sound
