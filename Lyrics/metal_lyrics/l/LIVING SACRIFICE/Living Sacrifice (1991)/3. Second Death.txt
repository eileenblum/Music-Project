Ending all of life beginning of death
Soul has been lost taken last breath
Descent to darkness life forever left
Imprisoned awaiting the second death
Incarcerate in a solid rock cell
Facing the reality the present hell
Absolute darkness one of isolation
Soul of the lost with will of separation
Rejected God intentionally unaware
Voluntary placement for this eternal nightmare
Losing grip of sanity mind goes insane
Loneliness of death creeps in to reign
Vile stench begins to fill the air
Demons gather with a hideous glare
Assembled to inflict verbal torment
Reminded of salvation seeds forever dormant
Now seeing through their black lies
Realization of eternity bleeds into cries
Sneering and chanting manifesting on the walls
Interrupted torture by the great one who calls
Transformed to the great white throne
Standing before God yet still alone
He releases the love that won't be received
Convicted now but too late to believe
Laid out for all his perfect will
And ignorant life remains unfulfilled
