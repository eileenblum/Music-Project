silence - at the threshold of life
can you feel - that empty body
do you remember - the way you lived
you are dying - all the years have
disappeared

why - did you live - wasted time
you - lived this way - you don't know why
you'd like - a few more days - though
there is no time
time - you wanna turn back - but don't
know how

everything - you are willing to give
you'd like - for the last time
to see - what you didn't realise
the wonderful - sunrise

you don't have a clue
everything you had - is lost
so many deceits
you went through - no more
cry - over the way
you lived - all the years - disappeared...

pain - you'd like to feel again
pleasure - you'd like to laugh again
to live - you'd know another way
you'd like - but there is no time
