my love is lost in the ocean of hatred
the girl whom I loved is dead and violated

I've stayed alone
with the pain
deep inside my heart

mother fucking bastard
raped and killed my sweetheart
satisfied his morbid lust
I've lost all my dreams

rage is burning my soul
It's getting
out of control
locked in this hell I'll be
and the killer stays free
