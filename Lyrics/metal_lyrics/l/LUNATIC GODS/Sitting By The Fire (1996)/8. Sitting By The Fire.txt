sitting by the fire
thinking how you're gonna change
the world

just have a look and you'll see
how the world's changed you
and you didn't care
only strong will survive

sitting by the fire
thinking how you're gonna change
the world

sit - by the fire - and think
about that - the strong - will survive

crying - you don't belong - to those
who are strong - you can't find - that power

sitting - by the fire - thinking how
to change everything - but you don't
know how

you're looking at stars in the sky
which one, which one is yours
you're waiting for help, it won't come
you aren't lucky, you are hopeless now
the fire is burning out
you don't have the power, any feelings
the fire has burnt out
the kiss of death on your mouth
