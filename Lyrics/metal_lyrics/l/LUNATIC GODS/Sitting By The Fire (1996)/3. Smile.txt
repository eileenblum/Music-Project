hey man you needn't cry
your face can give a smile
smile...

don't wait for your darkest hour
cause happiness is coming to you

you enjoyed what life was giving
but your smile has been stolen

you have found your face
and the feeling of happiness is gone again

so how much time have you got?
as much as you'll give yourself

stop frowning - only the life it self
will show you, you aren't alone

you live differently - than you lived
you're searching on your own

that smile there - even if you are alone
the smile has come back
