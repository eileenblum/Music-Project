I used to fear, i used to cry
I used to wish never to die
but I've changed my mind
life can't be survived

now I don't fear, now i don't cry
and what I wish is soon to die
because I see
only dead I'll be free

life is a prison
death will be release
just after death
all trouble to die

day by day
I had to strive
now I want to end it
I want to die

this fucking life
is a fatal disease
so why should I struggle
let me rest in peace

come on, come on
come 'n' die with me
death is the freedom
is suicide the key?
