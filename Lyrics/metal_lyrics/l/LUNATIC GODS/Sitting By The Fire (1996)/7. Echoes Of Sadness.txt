can you see
my world is dying
now I'm drowned
in the sea of mourning
since you have gone
there is darkness in my soul
I live on the edge lost in the memories

all the roses on your grave
have faded away
you left me locked in this prison
where I don't even realise
that life is passing me
I see me self in the mirror
of sorrow and pain

can you hear the bell
tolling on my way?

you've been sucked dry from your energy

why must we die
and pay for this existence

you can't struggle and set yourself free
