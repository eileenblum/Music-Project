they kept telling you: "don't go" and you did
there was nobody to stop you

you kept doing what you really wanted
you're irreparable, irreparable

you're going your own way
you're irreparable, irreparable

you've been living - free as a bird
irreparable - always first

you've yourself - and found vanity
unjustifiable - irreparable...
