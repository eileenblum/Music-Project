Falling into Darkness
Falling into Darkness
Down, forever down
Down, forever down
She lost her life
The horror in their hearts
What still remains
"What is still in front of us?"
The only hope
To believe in the Son
Nobody knows
"What is still in front of us?"
The tragedy that hides inside
The enemy who gave him life
They all proceed to share
Their ignorance
On the opposite sides
Continue the bloody fight
There is no paradise
When she is dead

Down!

To sacrifice yourself
For the children of the earth
To sacrifice yourself (Their fate is in your hands)
You will try to preserve
The life on the earth
If you fail the Earthfolk will fall (Their fate is in your hands)

You go to fight (fight)
Preserve the life (dying)
You go to fight (dying) again
You go to fight (fight)
Preserve the life (dying)
You go to fight (dying) again
Falling into darkness
Falling into darkness
Down, forever down
Down, forever down

What you don't know
The bonds between the dark and light
Each fights the other
"What is still in front of us"
Opposite sides
The Leader and the Son
Son fights his father
"What is still in front of us"
The tragedy that hides inside
The enemy who gave him life
The all proceed to share
Their ignorance
On the opposite sides
Continue the bloody fight
There is no paradise
When she is dead

To sacrifice yourself
For the children of the earth
To sacrifice yourself (Their fate is in your hands)
You will try to preserve
The life on the earth
If you fail the Earthfolk will fall (Their fate is in your hands)

You go to fight (fight)
Preserve the life (dying)
You go to fight (dying) again
You go to fight (fight)
Preserve the life (dying)
You go to fight (dying) again

You were born a man
You are human
