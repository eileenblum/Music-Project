Lonely time of desolation
Their fate is in your hands
With the feelings in your heart

To satisfy
Sacrifice
To put down the flames
Of the war scorching the earth

"You, human fools (forever down)
You, you will loose (forever down)"

You will sacrifice yourself
For the children of the earth
The blessed Queen of the world
(Their fate is in your hands)
You will try to preserve
The peace of the earth
If you fail the Earthfolk will fall
(Their fate is in your hand)

Please listen - "You'll never win the war!"
Read my words, accept my sacrifice - "We'll take it all!"
There's still a chance for peace - "You will not stay alive!"
We can live in peace with you - "We want to see you die!"

"You, human fools (forever down)
You, you will loose (forever down)"

You will sacrifice yourself
For the children of the earth
The blessed Queen of the world
(Their fate is in your hands)
You will try to preserve
The peace of the earth
If you fail the Earthfolk will fall
(Their fate is in your hand)
