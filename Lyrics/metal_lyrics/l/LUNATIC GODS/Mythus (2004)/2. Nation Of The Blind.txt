We're the nation of the blind
Underground
We're the nation of the hard
In the night
You never see the light
I am just a worm
Hiding all my life in darkness
There is nothing more
Just the myth that there is the sun
Shining Star
One day we will find it
Everyone
Strive for better life for all
Now the word is lost
Terrified

Underground
The toil is always hard
In the night
You never see the end
I am just a worm
Hiding all my life in darkness
There is nothing more
Just the myth that there is the sun
Shining Star
One day we will find it
Everyone
Strive for better life for all

You're never lost!
Raise your heads!
It's over my head
Shining star
Join me
On my quest
Right there
I see it shine
Way there
Over my head
Way up
Existence
Now the worst is lost
We'll find the star

The rays will shine above
I'll come from underneath
The rays will shine upon me
To live in peace
We're the nation of the blind
Underground
We're the nation of the hard
In the night
You never see the light
Underground
The toil is always hard
In the night
You never see the end
