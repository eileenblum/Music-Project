Everything is veiled by the dark
In the night time the worlds unite
Deep desire
In our minds
Deep in the night
The seed of life
Like a star
Desire will guide us to each other
By the moon
We are the same
Everything is as one
Our light
Is the same
Deep in the night
Now we are here together
So close in the dark embrance
In our minds the only light
The future is in our hands

Deep desire
In our minds
Deep in the night
The seed of life
Like a star
Desire will guide us to each other
By the moon
We are the same
Everything is as one
Our light
Is the same
Deep in the night
Seductive 
Candlelight
Getting nearer
Our bodies
Become one
The moon is born - from our desire
She was born in the Sun
He rules the Dark
Of their love
There was born a man
The last joy of the Earth

Deep desire
In our minds
Deep in the night
The seed of life
Like a star
Desire will guide us to each other
By the moon
We have become
One with the night
Waking up
To the morning light
Of a beautiful city
