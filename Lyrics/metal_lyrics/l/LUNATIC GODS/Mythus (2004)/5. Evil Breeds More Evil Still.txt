Light gets twisted in the eyes of the blind
The worms have come out of the underground
Worms are creeping for their future
Now the difference is clearly pronounced
When profit rules their minds

Anger crashes pride - war
"We want to live in here
We want your happiness
No more toil in darkness"
Anger crashes pride - war
"We'll never rest until we
Get what we strive to have
We'll never leave this land"

Stand face to face, the hatred in their eyes
"We do not want to share our way to paradise"
Worms are creeping for their future
Now the difference is clearly pronounced
When profit rules their minds

Anger crashes pride - war
"Give us your land
Give us your sunny day
No more toil in darkness"
Anger crashes pride - war
"That's what we strive to have
If we don't get it
Prepare for bloody war"

The war has begun
Now the world is divided
Their souls are commited, all respect is gone
In for a penny
In for a pound
Manipulated they're craving for more
The war has begun
Now the world is divided
Their souls are commited, all respect is gone
In for a penny
In for a pound
Manipulated they're craving for more

They, face to face, the hatred in their eyes
Here ends the peace, knife in your bloody hands
Worms are creeping for their future
Now the difference is clearly pronounced
When profit rules their minds

Anger crashes pride - war
"We want to live in here
We want your happiness
No more toil in darkness"
Anger crashes pride - war
"We'll never rest until we
Get what we strive to have
We'll never leave this land"
