The sun of life
Shows us the way
We follow straight
Leading hand by hand
The wisdom great
Above our destiny
We follow on
Devoted and fair
No thoughts of darkness
No thoughts of a wrong step on our path
This is where we stand
We lead our steps out to the sun

The sun of life
Shows us the destination
A paradise
Believe that we will make it
Wrong, wrong, wrong, we are wrong
A paradise
Believe that we will make it
Wrong, wrong, wrong, again

The earthfolk - we walk hand in hand
Treading across all that stands in our way
The earthfolk - we walk hand in hand
Treading across all that stands in our way
This is where we stand
We lead our steps out to the sun

The wisdom great
Shows us the destination
A paradise
Believe that we will make it
Wrong, wrong, wrong, live
The earthfolk - we walk hand in hand
Treading across all that stands in our way
