they were the beauty itself
they were the love they were the wisdom
the ones with hidden untouchable faces
brightly they shone in timeless glory
you love them
you need them
you are they
they are you
they're your death
but too much they saw too much they knew
all the love and all the wisdom
were desecrated by envy
and their souls were blackened by evil
you love them
you need them
you are they
they are you
they're your death
they were condemned by god
the light burned their once bright eyes
envy burned their wings marred their skin and faces
into the darkness they fell
through scars of mind you let them in
you offered them your flesh you offered them your mind
they made you blind as you let them see through your eyes
they made you naked as you let them dress your skin
in your blindness you feed them
you give them new wings to fly
they make you bleed from your wounds
they live from your blood and theirs poison you
the black angels of mayhem rise from your ashes
through you they enter their black Eden
and yours is hell
