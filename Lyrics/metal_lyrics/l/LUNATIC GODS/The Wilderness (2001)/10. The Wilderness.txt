wilderness
its pain
its silence
its beauty
nothing grows there
nothing moves there
nothing flourishes there
it's silent
thundering of deadly silence
rumbling of the sleeping earth
the cracking roar of the grey sea
it is your painful destiny
nothing grows there
nothing moves there
there's only one soul
wilderness
you won't be allowed to plant a seed
till you stop confining your soul
you won't hear the sweet melodies
till you raise your face from the dust
wilderness
wilderness
