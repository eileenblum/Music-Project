I tried as best I could
to grow up without blame
to be proud of being a man
to be proud of my name
what power has changed my way?
I can't escape from this maze
I can't turn back the time
why am I going insane?
I was born
and a seer foretold my fate
words he said
were imbued with hate
"you were born
with black blood in your veins
your fate's
to enslave the world in pain"
what power has changed my way?
I can't escape from this maze
I can't turn back the time
why am I going insane?
I tried to change that spell
my wishes have faded away
my life is a way to hell
a few words changed my fate
I was born
and a seer foretold my fate
words he said
were imbued with hate
"you were born
with black blood in your veins
your fate's
to enslave the world in pain"
