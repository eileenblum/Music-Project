yours is the defeat but yours could be might
yours is the darkness but yours could be light
you've perished your hope all your past pride
blindly you've stepped into the night
bleed from your wounds carry your cross
bleed from your tongue eat your lie
suffer naked nailed on a cross
a cross of your lie suffer and die
the dead bury the dead in silence
this is the sign of our era
blindly you run believe in nothing
I'm sick of you and your weakness
this song is a stone I've thrown at you
at your proudly raised heads at your pride
at your prejudices and empty dreams
at your sons carrying this smouldering torch
yours is the defeat but yours could be might
yours is the darkness but yours could be light
you've perished your hope all your past pride
blindly you've stepped into the night
bleed from your wounds carry your cross
bleed from your tongue eat your lie
suffer naked nailed on a cross
a cross of your lie suffer and die
this song is a stone I've thrown at you
at your proudly raised heads at your pride
at your prejudices and empty dreams
at your sons carrying this smouldering torch
no return you're dead
your sons close your eyes
and follow your path
into the abyss
