gulls on cliffs call my name
tomorrow won't be the same
one step between death and life
I'm trying to decide
life's a bitter pill
desires slowly dying
I'm trying to find my way
to escape or to live
voices that I hear
reality is dying
my spirit's breathing again
I'm spreading wings to fly
we just live from day to day
modern slaves of modern pray
we've forgotten our mystic way
we've forgotten to fly
life's a bitter pill
desires slowly dying
I'm trying to find my way
to escape or to live
voices that I hear
reality is dying
my spirit's breathing again
I'm spreading wings to fly
the same old questions the same old lies
I can't believe we are born to die
listen to our mystic side
you are born for a great escape
life's a bitter pill
desires slowly dying
I'm trying to find my way
to escape or to live
voices that I hear
reality is dying
my spirit's breathing again
I'm spreading wings to fly
