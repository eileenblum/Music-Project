mercenaries are at war
in the name of God
crowds of outcasts come so fast
sinners want to be saints
dancing devil is showing the way
to the holy grave
they forgot "thou shalt not kill"
blinded by hate
doomsday - your judge is coming
guilty - from all deadly sins
you'll taste - the pain they felt
verdict - death
their blood - burns your hands
their screams - burn your ears
their eyes - burn your mind
their death - is your death
