I want to die
don't be mad don't be blind
you are the winner
cursed is my life
don't be weak raise your head
yours is happiness
you look back upon your life
you see a battlefield
covered by your dead dreams
and corpses of your hopes
you see a battlefield
where you had to fight hard
in a disadvantage
to stay alive
you survived bud you're scarred
your body is crippled
you are tired but still
you are the winner
I want to die
don't let them take what's yours
you are the winner
cursed is my life
don't be fool you must fight
to defeat them all
you look back upon your past
at the battlefield of life
covered by your dead dreams
and dead wishes
but still don't deplore it
don't weep for your past wounds
don't give up the fight now
carry on
break the spell of sadness
and rise from the ashes
open your eyes to see
the whole truth
I want to live
carry on the fight
if you have some pride
I'm blessed by life
yes you are the one
you are the blessed child
