Wanna be a machine with an appetite for war
Need the injection give me the drug I want more
Wanna be machine with hunger for destruction
Remind you of hell remind you of distraction

I am the real thing
Gonna give you the real thing
I am the real thing
Gonna give you the real thing
I am what you gonna breathe
I am what you gonna feel
Now I got me a new toy
Gonna turn you into me

Wanna be a machine with a distorted smile
Control of humanity make them walk single file
Cannot sympathize with the stupid minded one
Cannot sympathize cannot sympathize
Wanna be a machine with an appetite to quell
I am distorted I am deranged feed me with hell

Find comfort in the new hell
Suck on the real thing

With a distorted soul I encircle it all
The dominating machine gonna make you fall
