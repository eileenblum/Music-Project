Famished ravenous starved voracious
I hunger flesh, I hunger soul mind
Famished ravenous starved voracious
I hunger flesh, I hunger soul mind
Warped beyond comprehension that what
I feed on resides in me, in me

Free my mind from all constraints
Sick thoughts rage like fire
Pain spreads through my spinal cord
Famished ravenous starved voracious

Feed us
Hunger spreads
Foetus
Feed me, foetus

Famished ravenous starved voracious
I hunger flesh, I hunger soul mind
Breaching through empty no more focus in my
Mind feeding on my sense, my sense
I subside all I am is me no hate fear pain life
Devotion, devotion
Famished ravenous starved voracious
