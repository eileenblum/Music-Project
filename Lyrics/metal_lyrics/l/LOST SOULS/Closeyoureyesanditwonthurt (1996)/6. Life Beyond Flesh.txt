Do you take kife for granted or take it
For what's its worth
Do you think you'll get rewarded
If you suffer down on earth
Believe you'll burn eternally
If you live your life in sin
When you reach the pearly gates
Saint Peter just won't let you in

Do you believe in demons
Do you believe in God
Do you believe...

Do you believe in life before death
Do you believe in life beyond flesh

Are you the kind who is dying
To live on the other side
The kind who thinks life is lying
Ready to take whatever death provides
Or do you live in anguish
In fear of the unknown
That we will surely perish
When the ship is going down

Live like there is no tomorrow
Getting ready to leave this life
Filled with lies and sorrow
Filled with lies and sorrow
