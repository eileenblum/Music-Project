Naked, laying on the ground
Bleeding, seeping down the drain
Life, ends and my vision blurs
Broken, inner skin protects
Hollow, body getting numb
Darkness, kill the sense of light
Life death love hate concrete

Time stops, laying on the ground
Chalk line, marks the final rest
Senses, amplified to max
Heart brain, ceasing shutting off
Life death love hate concrete

Can't feel it
Can't see it
Concrete mind
Concrete blind
Life so sweet
Body to concrete

Blackout, dead numb cold
I lay bleeding on the curb
Frozen limbs getting stiff
Dying ending fading out
Life death love hate concrete
