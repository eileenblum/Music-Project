Don't throng into me mechanical soul
A paralyzed mind is of no use
Black little demon give me peace
Restrain the needs with evil goals
I'll put you away I'll put you away
A joke with a mouth full of stones
Ignorance and disloyalty a good style combination

Taste my life your gods desire
God is a bullet so close your mind
Smell my Jesus I need you gone
Jesus is my gun so close your mind
Close your mind

Inject me and feel the misery
An overdose of unknown life
In-growing nails turn me on
Gonna bite my head off and kiss it
I'll put you away, I'll put you away
A joke with a head full of nothing
Ignorance and disloyalty good style combination

Don't bite off what you can't swallow
