Crawl before them
Controlled by their minds
Obey them blindly
Do their hate crimes

Lies, lies

Brutal ways to get respect
Darkened minds of hate select
Fill my life with threats and fear
Fill my head with lies and spite
Fill my soul with endless hate
Kill my soul with endless hate
Conformity

Give into their will
And play the new role
A shattered ego
For them to control
