Here I am welcome to my feast
Carnality is my existence
Human flesh sacred for me
Living parasite emotional discord

A life I can't defend
Shattered illusions awaiting the end
I seek the dying sick and deformed
I'm mutated and deranged, deranged

Trapped in my psychohead
Lost in my psychohead
Dead in my psychohead
Superior I'm superior
Psychohead

Blood runs red committing disgust
Grotesque acts into macabre lusts
Ferocious dream this can't be real
The pressure begins to rise
Bestiality must be sick
Screaming out cry within
Possessed by horrid crimes, crimes

My only solution will it be
The final escape to be free
My roting brain my only friend
Following me to the end
Solitude as I reach the room of solitude
Finally, as I finally walk the path of light
