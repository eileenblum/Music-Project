Minds evolve as bodies erode
Eyes that feed, information breed
Hybrid humans take the step forth
Creed of mind of hate, not soul

Pro-hate views of elite machines
Spawn the answer, the new doctrine
No more place in the new brave world
For human feelings, love

Feed the machine so pure and clean
Crucify me feed the hate
Silicon crown of thorns
Proccesing the new creed
Erase
Purge

Silicon tears for a dying race
No one left now, to hold the torch
Divide and sunder fall apart
Subjugation human race

Deviants of a dying god offer us,
The final resort
Find the answer, our way out
Procreate the living god

Replicate a semblance of life hurt of eons
Free at last
Letting loose the god of man
God in the machine

Failure means the end of all
World came down, now won't come up
Final chapter written in conclusion
Erased and purged, man no more
