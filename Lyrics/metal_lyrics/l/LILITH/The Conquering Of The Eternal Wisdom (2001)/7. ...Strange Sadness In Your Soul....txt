[Lyrics by: Pedro A.]

Like a magic light, I'll dissapear
To visit the Ancient Land of Souls
I use all the Elements, by my side
With the four Winds, help me wonder...

...I'll brake the silence with my sight
I'll brake the time with my will
Strange Sadness In Your Soul
Just let me forget your pain, away....

To begin, to become a Dark Star
To the end, with the Force of the Light
Your Cosmic Presence, in this time
In this life, I did stay and forget the past

A strange defformed sihouette
Pass the door of all fears
Gathered stars, False illussions
End of an Astral Trip
