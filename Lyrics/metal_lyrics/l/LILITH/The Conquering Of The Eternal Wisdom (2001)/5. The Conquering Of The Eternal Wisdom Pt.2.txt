[Music and Lyrics by: Pedro A.]

We traveled in the time, in search of the AUR
In this Enchanted Darkness
We followed to the weak of spirit
We dared defeat PHYTON

Distant dreams magnetized by me
In this Enchanted Darkness
The will is the only way to make it happen,
We surged in order to evokate the Energy of God

"...Wich is the elect day of the souls?
How see through the thought?
...Our freedom and will, they are Sacred Elements,
From Incomparable power, Magic Instrument..."
