Waiting the shine of the moon
As wolves waiting for the blood
In this cold night of warlocks, of shadows
We evocate Lilith, mother of all demons

...Queen of the night, dark spirit
Magic passion I have for you...

I will lead the night beings and the shadows
Searching again for the mystic destiny
We are returning to the fields of pain and darkness

(The occult memories, the wisdom are at our sight)
