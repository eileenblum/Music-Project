Evilness I have in my soul
And it gives me occult powers
Darkness I feel around all
Visions of death, and murder all

I've killed god in the world of black dreams
I took the bleeding sword of Mars
And the wonders of the death and passion

...A nightmare of confuse places
An endless passage to hell...

Trapped in a wave of flames
I saw the Magic and the serpent
It said: "Only you have the Eternal Wisdom,
And the keys of Heaven and Hell"
