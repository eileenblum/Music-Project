In a mystic night of winter
When the souls are flying free
And the moon eclipsed
With Pluto, the death!

All turned black, and a red cloud from the ground
Showed the majesty, under the falling temple
Now my body starts to die

His face with many strange symbols
Rebellion, the secret dark arts
Ancient pagan god of torment
The black Monolith of Death

...Now the new day comforts me
The black nightmare is getting away
My soul is flying free
Away from the darkness...

The eternal suffer never ends
Is a legacy from the past
Lords of stones, the perpetual keeper
Of another dimension
