Across these magic woods, I wondered silently
I felt the magic breeze, the smell of nothingness
I've returned like a wizard, an evil mist
All this nights off full moon, I'm searching for you

All this nights of full moon, we find a second sight
Just open your eyes and see that I'm not here
I'm lost in the eternal hell of dark illusions
The cosmic silence, the infinite distance, the atemporal time

Again this time, I'm far away from my feelings
Open your senses to the ecstasy of the pleasure
I'm the flame fading in the shadows
I'm the shadow burning in the flames
