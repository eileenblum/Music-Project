In the dark passages of my mind
Echoes in the obscurity, your smell in the air
Walking though this enchanted woods
I found you evocating the Four

I felt in the cold rain, your evil presence
And saw my princess between heaven and hell
She took me to the eternal portal
The beginning of the times, the final destiny

(The mystic ages saw you born
To the moon you sang and danced)

Adam suffered human fury
And the beauty Ceremony of Blood and Lust!

This night of beautiful mist
We shared Dionysio's wine
We are lovers living for the pleasure
Of destroy the weak heaven

Take my love to your dark palace
To share the blood, the life, the passion
Walk with me across these fields of pain
Across the times, though the pentagram
