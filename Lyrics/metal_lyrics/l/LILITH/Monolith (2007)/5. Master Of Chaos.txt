In the deepest cave I confine my days
Submerging into the vast obscurity
Protected by the evil powers
And cursed by the heavenly god

With your golden clothes and evil smile
You cause the cosmic cataclysm
With your silver and demonic sight
They obey thy deadly command!

I am the Master of Chaos
An angry goblin of evil
With my darkest powers
I am taking your soul!

Living into the mystic forest
Where's no escape for a human soul

Thou are mortal diseases and nightmares
In the nights of full moon
Ancient pagan Entity
Of the froze mountains identity
