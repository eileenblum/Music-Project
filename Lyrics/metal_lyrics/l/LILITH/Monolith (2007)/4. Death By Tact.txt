...the colours and textures, begin to burn
And will mix with you in only one thing...

He forgot the oceans and the voices
And made the crimson stay away
The long haired ones, the blood ones, the wind makers
The ones initiate by the triumph of the nature

...And everyone takes the music by its own
To annihilate all besides all...

And the touch will have dark and evil presence
In the revelations of the ages and the rain

...Let the sword stay in my dreams
Of a lonely and dark angel
You touch yourself and you're scared
The death vaporizes, and the rest is magic...

The trumpet cries played bye the black wizard
Nothing, is you, either the sad drums
Even the dark woods that play for the night
Another one is inside me, deep inside
