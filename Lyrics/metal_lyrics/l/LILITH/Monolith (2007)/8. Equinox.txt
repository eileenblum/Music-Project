The cold of the night, embrace my mind
The greatness of the winds, evoke my name
Ancient stones, ancient memories
Give me the wisdom inside of darkness

The secrets inside of you are a mystery
But the shadows remember your great past
Into the mountains, into the sacred lake
Where the warriors create a new empire

Life and death, day and night
Is a perfect Equinox, inside the circle of the unknown
What you feel, what is seems?
Nothing is real in this astral place
