Silence enfolded my soul
Mystic symbols in the mist
I can see the ethereal mountains in the horizon

...The sun and day burns forever
Like the stars and the moon
Shine the eternal darkness
I the cold water of this enchanted forest...

The Night and the Dark River!

The echoes of the nature resound in my mind
The whispers of the air freeze my spirit
Follow into the deepest of your mind
Where you encounter the secret cosmovision

The Night and the Dark River!
