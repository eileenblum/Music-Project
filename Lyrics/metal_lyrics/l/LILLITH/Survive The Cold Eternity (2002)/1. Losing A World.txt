It is not anymore, something has died
in our hearts and hope is gone
we sing this song to soothe our souls
and to survive the cold eternity

[ref.] and in our hearts there's the void
of darkness and we will never forget the pain
where the ray of enlightment shines on our heads
nothing will be anymore, anymore

the lights are fading away, silence so beautiful
nothingness around us, darkness so sad
you'll never see, never will it be
in a broken world of both of us

[ref. ]
