Once in my lifetime I want to see
How this crazy place has got to be
I take a step behind the stage

I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the truth

Then I will understand
I have the reality in my hand
I'll die, it's too hard for me

After rebirth I forget again
What I'm doing here, what is happening?
I Repeat, I Repeat, I Repeat
This is a new life, another try
don't ever dare again to ask why
the answer is on the other side
