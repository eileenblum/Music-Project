My kingdom is falling apart
And I don't even feel a thing
All those dreams are for never now
I know time has left me

[ref.] I will leave now, good-bye
keep the memory alive
Give my body away
there's no reason to pray

No need for me anymore
I can go to sleep forever
I hear them calling for me
Out from the dark

[ref.]
...don't even cry, don't care why...
