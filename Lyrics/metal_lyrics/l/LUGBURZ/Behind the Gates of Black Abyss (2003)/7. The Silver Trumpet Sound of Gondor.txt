I can see into the horizon
And only the darkness
Hangs before my eyes...
I can feel in the distance
And only the ice
Breaks my silence crying out...

But my heart
Is strong
And it will lead my steps
Far away from here
Towards the final war...

Take my hand and follow me
To the realm of divinity...
In your eyes
My heart is crying
Lost between shadows
Forever...

Take my hand and follow me
To the land of eternity
Beyond the lost dreams...

My heart...
Will be waiting for you...
