Himnus
Obitus
In tenebris
Lux oculta...

Ignis
Umbra
In obscurus
Regnum...

Under the rain
The night descents
Lost between shadows
Embraced by the death

The light will not shine
In the land of war
The wraiths of the ring
Rise their swords
Riding black horses
Enthroning the black curse

Himnus
Obitus
In tenebris
Lux oculta...

Ignis
Umbra
In obscurus
Regnum...

Lords of the dark
Eyes of frozen mind
Call of damnation
Beyond the mystical night...

Screams in the fog
Implore the black mass
The spirits of darkness
Ride across the blood war
Summoning the circle
Of the eternal decay
