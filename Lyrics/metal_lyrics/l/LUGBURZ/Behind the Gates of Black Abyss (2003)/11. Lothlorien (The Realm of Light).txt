Behind the realm of silver dreams
Trees and lakes grow in silence
Between magic and divine light the sing
Beyond the ancient throne
Of nature...

The voices of the forest
Whisper old legends
About the light... the shadow...
The mysteries and the immortality...

The cry of the wind
Can be listened
Far away from its dwelling
Lost in hands of sadness
Which sprout on its heart...

Tintilar i eleni
Lassi lantar laurie soerinen
Sindan-riello mornie kaita...
Ananta...
Sinome maruvan tennâ Ambar-metta...
Aiya Earendil elenion ankalima
