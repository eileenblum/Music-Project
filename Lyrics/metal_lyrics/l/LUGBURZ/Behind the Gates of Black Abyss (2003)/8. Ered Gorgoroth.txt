Lost and dark land
Hand of wisdom
Darkness...
Beyond the maze of death...

Mystical ravens
Fly across the frozen fog
Between the light and the dark...

Bloody mountains
In silence...
Call the war
Behind the gates of sin...

The heavenâs crying
While the nightfall
Is imminent
Embrace by the lord of shadows...

Itâs time of war...!
