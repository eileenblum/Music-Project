It blew ice winds
They danced...
Like ethereal shadows
In the hands of silence...

Ice seas
Extended with no end in the old world heart
Their waters
Remained blind of power
Under the focused look of mystical gods
Who observed their sad cry
From parallel planes

The stars...
Made crosses at the top of the night
Reigning
Among dark cloudy pillars
Burying at the same time...
The ice that one day made the strong
