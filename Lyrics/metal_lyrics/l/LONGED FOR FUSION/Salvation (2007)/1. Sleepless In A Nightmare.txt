I wanna break out of everything
Of every nights nightmare that I'm in
Pull me out
Of my constant fear
To give back control that I have lost

I wanna break out
Of closing my eyes seeing terrible things
I'm so frightend of
Pull me out
Of not talking about, not to be jeered
You know you'll never know

Oh, I'm afraid at night
Oh, I'm afraid to die

I wanna break out
Fleeing from these noises, hunting me
Like pictures in my head
Help me out
It's following me, the bending machine overpowers me

[chorus 2x]

My eyes stay awake
My head is asking why
Oh, it's so damn hard
Time's not going by

My eyes stay awake
My head is asking why
Oh, it's so fucking hard
Time's not going by

Pull me out!

I wanna break out
Before it's tearing me down
Before my mistrustness destroys me
Help me out
And wake me up
Before this nightmare kills me

[chorus]
