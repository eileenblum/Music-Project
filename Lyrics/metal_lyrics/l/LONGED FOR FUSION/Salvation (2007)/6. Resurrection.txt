When we met last time
First snow has fallen
Still can remember
I finally left you
The way of your smile
How can you remember
How long I wished
You would still be mine
Didn't smile for
A long, long time
Thought we had
Separated for good
We broke up for
Different reasons
Is this still you
Do not recognize
You anymore
Forever no more
Side by side
You have to realize
To see you now again
Breaks my heart in two
I don't care anymore
Thought I was over you
But I was wrong
Didn't make it
Easy myself
As we stay here
Together again
Prove me
You have changed
I wished we had
Never parted
You know the best
Why we broke up
I would give anything
To make you
Change your mind
You have to give
Everything to make
Me change my mind

We both have
To admit ourselves
That we belonged together
We would regret
The rest of our lifes
If we'd followed
Different avenues
This night will be
Our resurrection
Forget about the past
Let the bright moon be
Our witness
Let this moment
Let this moment last
[2x]

We... we resurrect!
