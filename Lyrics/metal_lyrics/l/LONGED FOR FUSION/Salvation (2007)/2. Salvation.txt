Times around me standing still
Deep inside my heart you're with me
I never forget, never forget
The time, time with you
How great it was, oh
[chorus]

There's the time, standing still
Deep in my heart you're still with me
I never forget the time with you
How nice it was, how great it was

I should have seen the signs
The one who loves, deserves to fall

I have spent every night
In mourning sorrow in grief
And pain
I finally see the light
The one salvation, the end of game

[chorus]

Oh

Dark sends a shadow over the gift of love
Poisoned heartbeats pump salvation
Through the body once filled with love
Yet left to fall into its grave
