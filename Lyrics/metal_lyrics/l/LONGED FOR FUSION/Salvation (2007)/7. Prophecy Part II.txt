Never thought about before
Living without your unique love
Where ever you might be
Listen to my thoughts
I feel the same like every day
There's still this seering emptiness
Listen to my words

I call your name
Full of mourning
Never again, I'll be waiting for you

I call your name
Full of mourning
Spread my wings and fly away

[chorus]

Before I'll die
Smelling your lips
Feeling your proximity
The clouds are turning into grey
Now I'll die

While standing on your grave
The prophecy became true
And now I died
