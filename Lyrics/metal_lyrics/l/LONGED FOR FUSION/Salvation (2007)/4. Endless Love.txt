It seems like a lifetime since you passed through that door
It's only your perfume that stayed a little bit more
Do I remember the colour of your eyes
Is it green or grey, grey or blue â what did we do

Come back home
You're too long gone
I drown like a stone
If you won't come home

It was a quiet word, it sounded like breaking
Sounded like my little world, like the end of it
I'm dancing with a shadow hanging in the air
Like some forgotten arrow, I'm flying nowhere

[chorus]

Nobody kisses like you do
Nobody loves like you
[chorus3]

[chorus2]

[chorus3]

And when you do I love you
Nobody loves like you
