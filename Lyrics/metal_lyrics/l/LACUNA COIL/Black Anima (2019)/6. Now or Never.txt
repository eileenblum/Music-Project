Walk me out of here
Take me away

I made my way back to the living
When I was already dead
I can't believe this is for real
I felt my heart skip a beat
My vision was so unclear
As I slowly revealed myself

Now or never
The time is right
Out of your shelter
Crawl back to life

The beast is still unleashed
I'm hating all of this
I don't know what is wrong with me
I know I will take the blame
I left the good times in the past
And maybe I'm already dead

I won't surrender
To a corrupted soul
Under bloody flags
We march in pain
Through the turmoil
Hold the flame
There's no mercy for the innocent

Now or never
The time is right
Now or never
We are not down on our knees
We're close to victory
