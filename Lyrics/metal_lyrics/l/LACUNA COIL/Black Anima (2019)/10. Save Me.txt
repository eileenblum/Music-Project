Save me from myself
I can't help it
I'm breaking down
Save me from myself
I could use your strength
Right now

My skin is crawling
And feel this pressure
Pushing from the inside out
I have lost my nerve
My mind is racing
Insomnia kicks in
Burning in my darkest thoughts again

So I keep asking myself
Will I be strong enough to face this mess?
So I'm still here begging for help
We're only humans walking through this hell

Save me from myself
I could use your strength
I'm breaking down

Oppressed and hopeless
And held in this spell
I don't know how to find a way
To release myself
I am going crazy
So close to giving up
Nothing here feels like it used to be

And what remains is the shadow of my past
I look in the mirror
And hate what I see
I don't recognise my face anymore
And wonder where all of my dreams are gone
Feeling lost and empty
I know I can't turn back time
But I just don't want to give up
I can't give up
