Nova vis ad diem novum nascitur
PenÃ¬tus veneficium versatum revincitur

I'm unmoving like a stone
This silence screams so cold
I wish I was so far from here
But now
I think we need to talk
Sit right in front of me
The dream we had has come to an end

I would destroy my own life
To consume your soul
And smile
But I'm locked into your world
Again

Here I come
To show you all the wounds
Inside my heart
But it's all in vain
Here I come
I know
That it will never be the same

Now
I need to be alone
I spin out of control
We're trapped inside the dream again
Look now
What we have become
You're like a parasite
Infecting me until the end

There was a time
We looked down from the clouds
We climbed sky high
Thought that we would never fall
How come you didn't even try?
Was it harder to fight than to let me go?

Nova vis ad diem novum nascitur
PenÃ¬tus veneficium versatum revincitur

Arise
Inside of you
Defeat again

Here
I want to start again
Keep learning day by day
Forget the fear and feel free at last
Because now
I'm closer to the edge
I'm afraid to see what I became
I know that it will never be the same

Here I come
Knowing I will never be the same
