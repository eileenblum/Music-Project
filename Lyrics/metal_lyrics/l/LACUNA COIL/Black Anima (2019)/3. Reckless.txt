Tonight it's coming down
To hell with all the innocence
The signs are all around
I've had enough
Wasted too much time
Afraid to cross the line
Enough with alibis

You make me, make me reckless
You make me reckless
You make me, make me reckless
(Destroy)

Let's wreck it down
Let's be wild and get reckless
(Now destroy)
Keep the madness endless
Give me danger along the ride

(Unafraid to self destroy)

Things won't be slowing down
I'm high enough on bitterness
The fire fills my eyes
(Not afraid)
I have never learnt to compromise
I need to feel alive
Enough with alibis
(Feel alive)

You make me, make me reckless
You make me reckless
You make me, make me reckless
(Destroy)

Let's wreck it down
Let's be wild and get reckless
(Now destroy)
Keep the madness endless
Give me danger along the ride

(You make me reckless)

Let's wreck it down
Let's be wild and get reckless
(Now destroy)
Keep the madness endless
Give me danger, come on, enjoy the ride (Smash)
And break this down
Let's be wild and get reckless
(Destroy)
Keep the madness endless
Give me danger along the ride

(Unafraid to self destroy)
