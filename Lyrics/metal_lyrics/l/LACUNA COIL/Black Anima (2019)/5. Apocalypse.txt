While you pray
We don't care

While you pray

Apocalypse
It's going down
This time
And I'm surprisingly alive
We've been condemned again
Guilty of our innocence
Do you preach about the revelation
So far from evolution

You're far from the solution

While you pray
We start a revolution
You don't care
And celebrate your lies
While you pray
You're far from absolution
We don't care
We leave it all behind

We don't care

Tell me all about your life
Looking at the sand gliding down
Through the hourglass
Here we are again
We know only time will tell
Let the fate decide
Right here
Staring in each other's eyes
Trusting in each other's lies
