The calm before the storm
Clouds are moving in anticipation
I'm longing for the rain to wash it all away
Slowly I am losing control

What's on the other side of the clouds?

It's time to let go
Release all control
Destroy everything
Rebuild it again
Let go

The countdown has begun
Control
Delete everything
Destroy
Erase and rewind
Rebuild
Repeat

Go
Together we'll erase the suffering
Smash
Disarray
Our world is afraid
And falling
Pain
We are chasing the ghost
That's trapped inside

I can see your anima

You and me
Against the world
When you're feeling all hope is lost
You are not alone
In a world of disarray
All the walls that keep us separated
We will break them all
And reunite
And when I'll be gone
You'll keep our legacy alive

Break
Smash
Disarray
Chaos
Rise
