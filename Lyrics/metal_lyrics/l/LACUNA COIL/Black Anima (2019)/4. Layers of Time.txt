Layers of time
Layers of time

I live the life I left behind
A story born of scars and strifes
My heart is blind and frozen
I'm among snakes
I'm well disguised
Healers and dealer of this time
The poison enters every night
Well disguised
Victims of time
We take our chance again
Our road is paved with pain
The past we can't rewind

Building this life
Still trapped inside
I think I've lost the storyline
Forever hurt and broken
I swear I'll get out alive
Burning the bridges built behind
My life's reloading every night

Out alive

Victims of time
We take our chance again
Our road is paved with pain
The past we can't rewind

Twisting
Turning
Through the baptism of fire
Burning
Angels
Falling
Through the spiral of time
Twisting
Turning
Through the baptism of fire
Burning
Angels
Falling
Through the spiral of time
Twisting
Turning
Through the baptism of fire
Burning
Angels
Falling
Through the spiral of time
Twisting
Turning
Through the baptism of fire
Burning
Angels
Falling
Through the spiral of time

Through layers of time
We'll live again
Forget the past
We'll be alright

Victims of time
We take our chance again
Our road is paved with pain
Keep walking
We'll find the way

Layers of time
