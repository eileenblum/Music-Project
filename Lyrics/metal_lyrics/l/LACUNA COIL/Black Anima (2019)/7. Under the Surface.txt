Beneath the gloss
There is no escape
You're looking sharp
But the smile is fake
There's much more
That hides behind
All your senses are compelled to lie

Solitary warm embrace
That keeps me here confined
Can't run away
I search for comfort deep inside
And I don't want to get away
Escape from here
I could be wrong but I don't care
I'm imprisoned deep
Alone
Living in isolation from the world

Demise
But I feel fine

Everything feels perfect
When you're spinning lies
Deceiving yourself
But deep under the surface
The battle comes alive
Don't want to fight
Everything's collapsing
But you don't seem to care
Disown
Illusions and emotions are for sale

Life
There is no point

Loneliness won't let me go
And crawls beneath my skin
It's moving in
The filtered world I'm living in
Is not as perfect as I think
Don't want to hear
It all gets old within a week
But I just don't care
Alone
Living in isolation from the world

Everything feels perfect
The culprit sleeps inside
But deep under the surface
Your weakness comes alive
Everything's collapsing
You never stood a chance
So keep on burying your head in the sand
