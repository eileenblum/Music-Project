I am just realizing
This pain is almost like salvation
Keeps coming back to me
Protects me from the voice of madness

Clean away my sins
Because I want to be with you
Now please
Answer my prayers
Because the end is all I can see

Twisting and turning
Anxiety moves in
Is coiling inside me
The evil within
Stinging and burning
Consumes me with guilt
It plays with my senses
Then crawls out of me

No one answered my prayers
There is nothing left here for me

Now
You need to burn it down
Let's give it all an end
I'm caught inside a maze
I need to get out of this
Trapped inside
A prison in disguise
I keep running around in circles
Stuck on repeat again

Burning your sins
