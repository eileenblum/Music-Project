I like to bury myself in pain
You know what I mean
I like to suffocate in all my memories
Until I cannot breathe

So I can taste again
How hard it is
To have a frozen heart inside my chest
That only beats but doesn't feel

That wall inside the room
Are closing in
I cannot see a door
A little sparkle of light
I cannot see any hope

I wonder
Is it all my fault?
Is it because of me?
Is it because I never care enough?
And now I pay for this

Cosa ne rimane della mia anima nera?
Anima nera
Anima nera
Anima nera
