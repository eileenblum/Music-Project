We are the anima

Ride

We came
Rising from the dark
We've been riding for so long
It's coming
Many things to overcome
Always learning from our past
Bringing vengeance from the gods
Never lost our way

We don't heed you
The sword of anger
Will cut in the deep
Still moving alone

We feel no pain

We don't heed you
Beyond the blackness
We find harmony
Never belong

Always chained to the sorrow
Never hide behind remorse
Silent ghosts
Of what once was
Rising from the shadow
We've crossed to the other side
And never lost our way

Still running alone
With no interest in what you say
To free ourselves from the boundaries
Let's breathe reeling into the darkness
Swimming past all the hatred
Overcoming our failures
Beyond the surface
We dig in the deep
There's more to us than you will never see

More
Feel no pain
We feel no pain
Never lost our way
