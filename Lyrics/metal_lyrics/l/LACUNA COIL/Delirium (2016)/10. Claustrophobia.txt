If love is the answer
Why does it feel so good to hate?
I don't give a damn about heart shaped lies anymore
I don't need forgiveness
I don't want to listen to your prayers
I want to rise up to the stars above
And fall down to the ground above

Why
Why don't you try
Why don't you stay with me?
(Time is over)
When I'll be gone
You will be suffering for me

You think that I am worthless
Like one of your dolls that feeds on pain
I don't give a fuck about the heart shaped clouds
I will open my eyes
Stay away from you

Why
Why don't you try
Why don't you kill me
(Time is over)
When I'll be gone
You will be suffering for me

Claustrophobic hate
Starts a chain reaction
If it doesn't kill you
It will shape your life
Will hate be the answer?
