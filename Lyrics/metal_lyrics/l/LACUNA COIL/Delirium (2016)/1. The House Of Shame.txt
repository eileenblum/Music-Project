Run!
Rise!

Burn me
Reducing the stigma
Born to live in this house of shame

While I dig the grave
On my path to find faith
You weren't there
While I was dying

You're the reason I'm feeling so deranged
I will stay here and haunt you forever

Why always staring into the light?
If I don't hide inside the darkness
You'll be compromised

But sometimes
You will fly with me again
Without falling [2x]

Rise!
Read my words
Run!
Mark my words

I'm bedridden here
Locked outside of my faith
Incurable, captured by time

You're the reason I'm feeling so deranged
I will stay here and haunt you forever

Why always staring into the light?
If I don't hide inside the darkness
You'll be compromised

But sometimes
You will fly with me again
Without falling [2x]

I told you to leave me alone [4x]

Take my soul

Sometimes
You will find me there again
Without mourning [2x]

Sometimes
You will fly with me again
Without falling [2x]

Rise!
Read my words
Run!
Mark my words
