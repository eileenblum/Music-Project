Shutting down my mind
No more hurting
From everything insane

Use every word to blame
Makes a deeper cut
Inside

Sensory overload
Makes me want to scream
And close my eyes

Eradicate
Never fails to take its place in line

It's not too late
To take it all
Embrace the pain
That breaks me down

Shutting myself off
Getting numb inside
What did you just say?

Unconscious and confused
I can't stand the noise outside

Even if you think I'm fine
I'm still damaged
I stay out of sight

Eradicate
Never fails to take it's place in line

It's not too late to take it all
Embrace the pain that breaks me down

Now it's too late
I've take control
I embrace the pain that keeps breaking me down
Once more

It's not too late to take it all
Embrace the pain that breaks me down

Breakdown [2x]
