Will not get out of my face
Locked here I cannot escape
It's my life
What the hell is going on
'Cause everything feels like it's fading
Every day seems like it was the day before
And I can't take it
I just want to erase the things I hate
And all the faces I see right in my face again and again
All I've got for this is nothing but hate right in my face
Feeding my rage all I've got for this nothing but hate

I'm a ghost in the mist (it's my life)
My life slips away
I wander unseen (compromise)
I don't make any sound
I'm lost in the mist (going blind)
No one showed me the way
Locked in by my fears (paralyzed)
With my knees on the ground

Every day it feels like is so predictable
And I can't change it
I just want to break these habits
Take control of this confusion
Will not get out of my face
Locked here I cannot escape
Can't get you out of my face
What can I do now?
Locked here I cannot escape
What have you done now?
I will not forgive
You can't get it out of me
So what have you done now?
Locked here I cannot escape
What have you done now?
Will not forgive what you said
What have you done now?
Locked here I cannot escape
What have you done now?
I will not forgive you
