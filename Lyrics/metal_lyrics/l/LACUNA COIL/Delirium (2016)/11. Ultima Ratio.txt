He's trying to run
He cannot hide anymore
The hunt has started
Dead or alive
There is no terror in my eyes
It feels like I'm paralyzed in Hell
No more time to realize
It is now or never
Breath is short but I'm alive
I'm getting closer to the gate
Keep on hiding in the dark
Will this nightmare ever end?
Inmate out
Time to track him down
Lock him back inside his cell

Save me
Before I fall apart
Come closer to me while I'm still alive
It never ends

No end
Red lights are flashing in my eyes
Sirens ringing in my ears
Here's a chance to save my life
I'm not ready for this
I'm trapped inside
The fire of all the things
That might have been
The torture never ends
