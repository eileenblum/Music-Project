And I don't know what to say
I'm thinking about you
It's hurting without you
I never learn from my mistakes
I feel fucked up today
My demons cursing me as I'm awake
My head is spinning
I can't think straight
Your words are poison inside my veins
You lied (I don't believe you, I can't relate)
You lied (I hate your voice 'cause it sounds so fake)

You lied
And I don't know what to say
I'm thinking about you
It's hurting without you
I never learn from my mistakes
I'm thinking about you
I'm choking without you

I should have walked away
And break the circle that never ends
No other way to survive the pain
It's either I kill or I will be killed
You lied (But I'm still giving myself away)
You lied (I don't regret every single day)
I think of you
And I can't forget
Every word you said
Hurts inside my head
Cannot let you go
Things will never change
I feel fucked up today
It's either I kill or I will be killed
And I know right now
There is no way that I will be killed
You lied
