I can't surrender
I cannot breathe
And I'm still going under
It's hard to realize
It's getting closer
I fear this struggle
Is wasting me from inside

Delirium

Inside obsession
Is growing faster
There's no medication
It's hard to realize
Lost in confusion
I hear the silence
Is screaming aloud inside

Delirium

Enclosed in a shrine
Locked away inside my mind
I walk in the darkness and neon lights
Delirium will take me away
