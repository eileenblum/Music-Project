Do you remember my friend
When I was frozen and dead inside?
A piece of nothing in this world
Till I heard she said

Three nights of Hell
Immortality spell
Light up the skies
Make it through the darkness

Can you believe this, my friend?
I was empty and broken inside
She came to save me from the storm

Blood
Tears
Dust
Take my blood
Tears
Dust

Time belongs to you and I
There's nowhere else
I wished I could be
Mountains high
Dark river flows
The wind will blow
Our fire will burn
Again
