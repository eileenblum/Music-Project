Staring at the sun
no rays down on me
I call you in my arms
embrace is unreal

You're moving on
we'll never be apart
just drain my tears
I cry aloud

You're moving on
you'll never be a part
of all my tears
I cry aloud

Calling on your sins
you're here in my dreams
a desert place
I'm not alone

Do you really
want to be me?

You're moving on
we'll never be apart
just drain my tears
I cry aloud

You're moving on
you'll never be a part
of all my tears
I cry aloud
