I'll never find another way to be
And like an actor I do
The best I can

This is my dream

Believe in yourself
In all the things you do

This is my dream

Believe in yourself and all your dreams come true
You want it

You'll never find another way to be
You'll never change the way to live your life

I cannot write all my confessions
But alone with myself
I can't remind my past

This is my dream

Believe in yourself I know this time you could

This is my dream

Believe in yourself but

Never be so sure
You want it

You'll never find another way to be
You'll never change the way to live your life
