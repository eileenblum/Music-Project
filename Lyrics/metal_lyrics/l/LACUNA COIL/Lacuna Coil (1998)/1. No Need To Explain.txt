I got the key to open all the gates I see
I want this power inside of me
This passage is full
of different gates I see

Just try to be yourself

Try to destroy all what you feel inside

Take and hold this hand
What you feel inside
Is another dream
Want you give me a part?
Let me say you're truly raspy
but I'm living to discover your soul

Just try to be yourself

You've got to be strong
Live in an harder way
Now

Take and hold this hand
What you feel inside
Is another dream
Want you give me a part?
Let me say you're truly raspy
but I'm living to discover your soul

And I know you're scared about the life that comes

(Look in the mirror the fear is a part of you)

Stronger and strong
I'll help you to choose the way
Can't you let me go
away
