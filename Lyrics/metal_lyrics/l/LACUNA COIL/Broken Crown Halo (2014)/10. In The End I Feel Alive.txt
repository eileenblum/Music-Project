Silence in the room
But I still hear your voice
Iâve been awake all night
My heart is aching for you

Blinded by the light
I cannot see the answers
Here with open arms
My heart is waiting for you

How much this is gonna hurt?
You promise youâll never tell a lie
Donât tell me itâs over
Even in the end I feel alive

I did trust your words
But I donât trust your actions
Walk on broken glass
The chemical reaction
The chemical reaction

How much this is gonna hurt?
You promise youâll never tell a lie
Donât tell me itâs over
Even in the end I feel alive

Burn baby, burn baby
I will shut the door and hide the key
Burn baby, burn baby
Burn baby, burn baby
Give you a taste of your own medicine
Burn baby, burn baby
Time to break free

How much this is gonna hurt?
You promise youâll never tell a lie
Donât tell me itâs over
Even in the end I feel alive

Iâm alive, Iâm alive
