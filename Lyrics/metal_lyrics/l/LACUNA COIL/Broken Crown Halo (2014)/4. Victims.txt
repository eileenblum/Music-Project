Stumbling I almost fall
Walking blind in this decay
It's sending shivers down my spine again

Can't be running for our lives
We're still fighting for our land
Fight for something we don't understand

We need to free ourselves now
Then become
More human

We will not stand in line
Victims have fallen in vain
Frozen hearts, empty eyes
We've seen it all before

We will not stand in line
Victims have fallen in vain
Mother's tears, vicious eyes
We've seen it all before

Suddenly I'm on my own
I got lost along the way
I fell cold but keep the fire in me

Despite all broken dreams
We're still planning our defense
Against something we don't wanna be

We need to free ourselves now
Then become
Just human

We will not stand in line
Victims have fallen in vain
Frozen hearts, empty eyes
We've seen it all before

We will not stand in line
Victims have fallen in vain
Mother's tears, vicious eyes
We've seen it all before

People told me I was weak
I told them I'll never quit
I will never quit
I'll never
[x2]

Never break me down
Never break me down again

We need to free ourselves now
Then become
Just human

We will not stand in line
Victims have fallen in vain
Frozen hearts, empty eyes
We've seen it all before

We will not stand in line
Victims have fallen in vain
Mother's tears, vicious eyes
We've seen it all before

I don't want to hear no more
The rotten lies I heard before
Never break me down again
I cannot burn inside this hell
Vengeance
I think it's taking over me
Vengeance
You'll never run away from me
