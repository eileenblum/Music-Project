Fear

Weâre still struggling
Halfway through this journey
Our eyes are burning
But weâre not slowing down
I wish we could have
All the time in the world
But we have come too far
To give up who we are

We fear nothing, we fear nothing

Life long
Road blocks
High walls
Teardrops
Nothing stands in our way

Blood stained
Stock crash
Mistakes
Heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

Weâre still running
We are not afraid the thrill is on
Speed up without any brakes
Oh no
âCause sometimes we still
Have to hit the wall
To see things that
Are right before our eyes

We fear nothing, we fear nothing

Life long
Road blocks
High walls
Teardrops
Nothing stands in our way

Blood stained
Stock crash
Mistakes
Heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

We fear nothing
We fear nothing
Now that weâve come so far
Do you still remember our dreams
The need to have it all?
Donât give up
I feel we are almost there

Life long
Road blocks
High walls
Teardrops
Nothing stands in our way

Blood stained
Stock crash
Mistakes
Heart breaks
Nothing stands in our way

Thatâs our way
