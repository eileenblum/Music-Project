In the silence
The whistling gets louder in my ears
(Whisper in my ears)
The wind is blowing stronger
Itâs hard to keep my feet upon the ground
âCause Iâm ready to fly

Now this is who you are
Angel without wings
Sinner in disguise
Donât wonder why
You have never tried to
Believe in yourself become a hostage to the light

In this light
Iâm feeling safe so calm and unafraid
A bird without a cage
And now I have to take these chances
Wonât take off without jumping off the edge
âCause Iâm ready to fly

Now this is who you are
Angel without wings
Sinner in disguise
Donât wonder why
You have never tried to
Believe in yourself become a hostage to the light

Iâm a hero in the bright light
In this world of false illusions in my head
Iâm a zero in the dark night
Iâm a prisoner Iâm hostage to the light

Now this is who you are
Angel without wings
Sinner in disguise
Donât wonder why
You have never tried to
Believe in yourself become a hostage to the light

A world of false illusions in my head
Deep inside my head, deep inside my head
A world of false illusions in my head
Deep inside my head, deep inside my head
