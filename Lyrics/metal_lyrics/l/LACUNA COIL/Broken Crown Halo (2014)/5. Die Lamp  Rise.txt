Die, die

Werewolf in the nightlife
You won't believe your eyes
Blond hair in the red light
She's getting down, getting down
She'll never turn me down
Put another stake into my heart
There's evil in her eyes
I cheated death and I came back alive

Die and rise
And take a bite of life
Die and rise
With no regrets
Die, die

Black queen in the mirror
She's pulling me aside
One dose of the white light
I'm shutting out, shutting out
I wanna wake you up in the middle of a perfect dream
Adrenaline inside
I cheated death and I came back alive

Die and rise
And take a bite of life
Die and rise
With no regrets
Die, die

RisorgerÃ² ogni momento perchÃ© so che la vita si tramuterÃ  [5x]

Die and rise
And take a bite of life
Die and rise
With no regrets
Die, die
