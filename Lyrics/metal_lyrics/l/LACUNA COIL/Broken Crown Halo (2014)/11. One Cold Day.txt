Sometimes the sun shines cold
The road is lonely as I walk alone
In the sky the clouds are racing fast
It's becoming so cold outside

Time has come, time has come
And the clouds gather above me
And the clouds gather above me

As I stand in the rain of this cold day
Tears are the words when I cannot confess the pain
Time will heal
But I don't want to feel

Sometimes it's hard to let go
It's hard to move along the scars of life
Memories are blooming in the gloom
As I'm feeling so cold inside

Time has come, time has come
And the clouds gather above me
And the clouds gather above me

As I stand in the rain of this cold day
Tears are the words when I cannot confess the pain
Time will heal
But I don't want to feel

Cry in the rain
Release the pain
Cry in the rain
Release the pain

So cry now
Cry now and let it go
Cry now
Cry now and let it go
Cry now
Cry now and let it go
Cry now
Cry now
