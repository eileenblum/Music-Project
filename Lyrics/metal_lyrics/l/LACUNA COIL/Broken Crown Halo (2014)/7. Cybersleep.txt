As the time and space are moving
Another gate is closing
Here I feel safe
And I donât want to go back to my world

Cybersleep feels so real
Memory cut to shape
Miracles lives inside the dream
But when I close my eyes and everything feels good
It wonât be long until illusions will come true

Take me there
Just take my hand
And help me fly
Try to understand

Locked away the secrets deep inside of me
I chose to live in here
Lost sight of what is real
Subconscious lies
Dream within a dream
But Iâm not afraid of this illusion
Still inside my head

Take me there
Just take my hand
And help me fly
Try to understand
Take me there
Just take my hand
And help me fly
Try to understand

A life of deception
To walk away from here
Why donât you follow me
Iâll show you how it feels

Subconscious lies
Dream within a dream
But Iâm not afraid of this illusion
Still inside my head

Take me there
Just take my hand
And help me fly
Try to understand
Take me there
Just take my hand
And help me fly
Try to understand

Take me there
Just take my hand
And help me fly
Try to understand
