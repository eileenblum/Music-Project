(Itâs coming down)
Iâm in your blood and like a poison in your veins
And small amounts Iâm killing you slowly
(Tell me why)
You cannot face me when Iâm staring straight at you
You cannot hide âcause I will haunt you

Weâre falling down into a grave
When all the trust has gone away
Now take this life and pull the trigger
Stop my pain

Itâs crashing down the sound of thunder
The lightning strikes and makes me blind
You drag me down and pull me under
Until you see me drown

(Bring me down)
Just like a drug I slow you down and make you numb
I got you high, I laid you so low
(I cannot move)
Youâre paralyzed with all my strength Iâm hurting you,
You sleep me awake itâs like a bad dream

Weâre falling down into a grave
When all the trust has gone away
Now take this life and pull the trigger
Stop my pain

Itâs crashing down the sound of thunder
The lightning strikes and makes me blind
You drag me down and pull me under
And spread around like a deadly infection

Itâs crashing down the sound of thunder
The lightning strikes and makes me blind
You drag me down and pull me under
Until you see me drown

Itâs crashing down the sound of thunder
The lightning strikes and makes me blind
You drag me down and pull me under
Until you see me drown

Drag me down and pull me under
Drag me down until you see me drown
