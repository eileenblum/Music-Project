[unreleased bonus track]

I saw you fade
Was it a dream?
The sooner have I tried to touch you
Slowly you disappear.

How to go on?
You'll never let me down again.
Hard to go on
I'll never be the one to blame.

Before

Floating in to your room
To see
What is inside,
Consequentially doomed
My peace
is out of sight,

Can't stay away,
Can't stay away from you.
Can't stay away,
Can't stay away from you.

How to go on?
You'll never let me down again
Hard to go on
I'll never be the one to blame.

Before

Floating in your room
To see
What is inside,
Consequentially doomed
My peace
is out of sight.

Can't stay away,
Can't stay away from you.
Can't stay away,
Can't stay away from you.
I can't stay away

Whatever I feel you
Whenever you keep coming through
No matter I miss you.
Whatever Can't stay away from you.
Can't stay away,
Can't stay away from you..
