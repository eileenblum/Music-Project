[Bonus track]

It's a fairy tale and the story is out of date
Nothing that I haven't tried to say
You know that the road is lonely
I will need some help
You know that this life is crazy
I will need some help

There's a place far below
The darkness deep within
It's a place, I don't belong
Come set me free from this oblivion

All inside of me
On the edge of agony
Nothing left for me that I can fake
You know that the road is lonely
I will need some help
You know that this life is crazy
I will need some help

And I keep wandering away
I'm so deep in disarray

There's a place far below
The darkness deep within
It's a place, I don't belong
Come set me free
