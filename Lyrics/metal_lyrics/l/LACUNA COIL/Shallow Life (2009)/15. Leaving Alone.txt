[Deluxe Edition bonus track]

Here today, I think I must have changed my mind
as I'm looking at things from a different side
I get up and fight off, the guilt last night
pushing back the fear
I will be my guide no one by my side
the only road, just me myself and I

I'm leaving alone tonight
I'm leaving the trust behind
I'm leaving alone tonight
I'm leaving it all behind

let the journey start, I finally freed myself
from the jealousy and revenge I have felt
I got out in time and I'm moving fine
I'll live to tell the tale
I will be my guide, no one by my side
this fearless road, just me myself and I

I can't awake this, it has slowly faded
you have made me feel so understated
this is the hurt that you have knowingly created
we have now become so overrated
