Watch your back
Because I am coming closer
Shivers down your spine
You were not expecting me

How does it feel to be faced in your territory?
Are you afraid to see me here?

I'm not afraid
To take my time, to live my life
The way I want to
I'm not afraid
To take you down and live my life as I want to
I'm not afraid

Closer but apart
No one else can hear us
Get out of the car
Did you want to leave without me?

How does it feel to be faced in your territory?
Are you afraid to see me here?
