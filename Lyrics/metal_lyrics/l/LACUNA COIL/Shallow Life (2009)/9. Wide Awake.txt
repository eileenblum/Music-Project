The rebel inside
A mind of my own
I haven't felt right
Since the moment I gave up
I challenged my limits
I'm feeling I'm becoming limitless
I take it all in and inhale

I'm wide awake
I open my eyes and the sky is so blue all of a sudden
I know that I treasure my life
I find myself
Wide awake
Like you
The struggle within
Now I understand freedom begins
When you get out of the cage you built
It looks like I'm crazy but I'm not the only one
To believe in myself, believe in myself
I won't be coming undone
Cause I feel like
