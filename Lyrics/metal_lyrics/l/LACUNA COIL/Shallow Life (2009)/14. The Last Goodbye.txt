[Japanese bonus track]

Whatever you did to me
You gotta, you gotta tell me now
Why do we look like strangers?
Whatever I did to you
No excuses for this silence
Tell me what you're thinking I'll be there for you

So many stories told, too many useless words
Maybe because it's getting dark inside

This is the last goodbye
These broken dreams have been resigned
Here's to our last goodnight
These broken dreams have been resigned

Will this set us both free?
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause I just don't understand it
Whatever I did to you
No excuses for this silence
Tell me what you're thinking I'll be listening

So many stories told, too many useless words
Maybe because it's getting dark inside

This is the last goodbye
These broken dreams have been resigned
Here's to our last goodnight
These broken dreams have been resigned

Why should I care when it will be alright?
Once separate ways we'll feel alive again
So many stories told, too many useless words
Maybe because it's getting dark inside

This is the last goodbye
These broken dreams have been resigned
Here's to our last goodnight
These broken dreams have been resigned

The last goodbye
The last goodbye
The last goodbye
The last goodbye
