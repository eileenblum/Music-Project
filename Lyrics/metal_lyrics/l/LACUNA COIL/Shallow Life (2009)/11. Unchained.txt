There is nothing up ahead
Or down the road
The streets won't last forever
There is nothing left to loose
I cannot see
Myself inside this dream
I know
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

Unchained
I'm like a bullet set free now
Unchained
I'm like a weapon unleashed now

Now I've found my way
To solid ground
I left behind the feeling
That I've been a fool
I feel much stronger now
I am not the same
You know
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
