Sometimes I feel alone in a million crowd
An outsider wandering alone without
Any words to say
They can't explain
The desire to overcome the pain
Feel the breath that's always getting away from me

Am I dreaming it all?
I will never be afraid

I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere.
I survive, feeling strong for how much longer?
I'll survive in this nothing leading nowhere
I survive

A voice inside of me
That keeps on teasing
As sweet as like a whisper from the lips of pain
And so many steps that I can't make
I can't take the chance, release the brake
And the breath just keeps on getting away

Am I dreaming it all?
I will never be afraid

I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere.
I survive, feeling strong for how much longer?
I'll survive in this nothing leading nowhere
I survive
