Clock is ticking while I'm killing time
Spinning all around
Nothing else that you can do
To turn it back

Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best, condescending smile

Trying to forget (Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth

COME and tease me

Clock is ticking while I'm still in time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle, set me free
Run away

Silence sneaking along my path
Grab the rope off me, feeling like we'll fly (Feeling like we'll fly)

Time to forget (Wasting my time)
The fall of my truth
Lying to forget (Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth

Trying to forget (Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
