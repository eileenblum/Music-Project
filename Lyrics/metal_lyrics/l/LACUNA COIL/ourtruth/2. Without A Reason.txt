Will you wash my feet again
With the tears I've cried out?
Will you save me from my selfishness?

Feels like talking to a wall
In this universe I'm lost
As I keep on searching
On and on without a reason

Here I come to show you,
Our path it is your heart
I'm melting into you
Our destiny so cruel

In the journey of my existence
I felt strong in my believes
Could I find a better way to
This reality?

Feels like talking to a wall
In this universe I'm lost
As I keep on searching
On and on without a reason

Here I come to show you,
Our path it is your heart
I'm melting into you
Our destiny so cruel

Feels like talking to a wall
Feels like talking to a wall

I'm melting into you
Our destiny so cruel

Feels like talking to a wall
Feels like talking to a wall
Feels like talking to a wall
Feels like talking to a wall
