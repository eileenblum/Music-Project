Forget the pain and all the games we play
Forget the worry and the shame
I don't want no more
The gates of hell are waiting,
Let them wait a little more

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me but let me go

With no regrets I lay down all my blame
The fate, the hate it's all the same
(You will become who you are)
I don't care no more
The gates of hell are waiting
Let them wait a little more

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me but let me go

[Italian:]
Senza rimpianti abbandono la colpa
Il destino E l'odio sono una cosa sola
I cancelli dell'inferno cI stanno aspettando
Lascia che attendano
Ovunque Stia andando
Il mio spirito E' libero
Sto tornando a casa
Conserva il ricordo
Ma lascia che io vada

[English translation:
With no regrets I lay down all my blame
The fate, the hate, it's all the same
The gates of hell are waiting
Let them wait a little more
Where I go
My spirit is free
I'm coming home
Remember me
But let me go]

Where, where I go
My spirit is free, I'm coming home
Where, where I go
Remember me
Remember me
Remember me but let me go

I can feel I can fly
Where I go
I can feel I can fly
Where I go

[This song goes out to our fallen brother Pete, we miss you but your legacy will be forever with us]
