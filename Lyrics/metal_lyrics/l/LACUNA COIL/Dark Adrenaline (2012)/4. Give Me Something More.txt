I disappear into the night
The silence is cursing me one more time
I'm not alone in this decline
Cause all my demons have come back to life

I cannot wait for a savior
My angel is long gone
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna pray
I don't wanna pray (give me something)
I don't wanna pray

Give me something more
Give me something more
Don't shut my eyes
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

I cross the line
The walk of shame
I hear the church bells through the acid rain
I'll cannot trade the wrong for right
And pick up the pieces come back inside

I can't deny
Don't ask me why
I feel the pressure everywhere
It starts inside
Erupts in pain
It knocks me down
Am I insane?

Give me something more
Give me something more
Don't shut my eyes (give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

I can't deny
Don't ask me why
I feel the pressure everywhere
I cannot stand this life in vain
Give me a sign
Am I insane?

Give me something more
Give me something more
Don't shut my eyes (give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

Give me something more
Give me something more
Don't shut my eyes (give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice

I cannot wait for a savior
My angel is long gone
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna pray
I don't wanna pray (give me something)
I don't wanna pray

Give me something more
Give me something more
Don't shut my eyes (give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice (give me something)

Give me something more
Give me something more
Don't shut my eyes (give me something)
Give me something more
Give me something worth the sacrifice
