I don't understand I don't know what to do
Once again I fail to even realize
The person that you think of me
Doesn't care, doesn't see, i don't listen anymore

Don't try to change your life with mine

I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster
I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster

I don't understand why do you feel confused?
Once again you failed to even realize
The person that you think of me
Doesn't care what you believe
Doesn't listen anymore

Don't try to change your life with mine

I'm living the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster
I'm living the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster

I don't understand why do you feel confused?
Once again you failed to even realize

I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster
I'm leaving the dark side upside down
Laughing at my disaster

Upside down, upside down
Laughing at my disaster
Upside down, upside down
Laughing at my disaster
