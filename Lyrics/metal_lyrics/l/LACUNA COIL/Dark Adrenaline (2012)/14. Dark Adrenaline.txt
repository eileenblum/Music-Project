[Japanese Bonus Track]You can run, I will reach you
You can run, I will reach you
You can run (you can run), I will reach you (I will reach you)
You can run (you can run), I will reach you (I will reach you)
You can run, I will reach you
You can run

Oh, when Darkness calls I escape
This dream has taken me so far away
I feel my pulse race as I come
Into you

You can run, I will reach you
You can run, I will reach you
You can run
You can run
You can run
You can run

You can run, I will reach you
You can run
