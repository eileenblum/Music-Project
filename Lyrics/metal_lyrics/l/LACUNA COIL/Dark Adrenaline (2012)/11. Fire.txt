Let the fire enter you
Let the anger start to brew
Let your instincts break the rules
Let it rise and rise in you

Let's take it outside
Burn this town
You see it on my face
Gonna beat you down

Unleash the rage
Trapped inside
I am burning
Let the fire enter you

Let the fire enter you
Let the anger start to brew
Let your instincts break the rules
Let it rise and consume
Give in to yourself

You started this fight
Face me down
My adrenaline rush
Is slowing down
Take your place on the firing line
You'll be burning

Let the fire enter you
Let the fire enter you
Let the anger start to brew
Let your instincts break the rules
Let it rise and consume
Give in to yourself
Let the fire enter you
Let the anger start to brew
Let your instincts break the rules
Let it rise and consume

You're on the ground
Not much fight
Compassion is gone
I'm still fine
So take my rage
Enjoy the ride
Feel the hurting

Let the fire enter you
Fire enter you
Fire enter you

Let the fire enter you
Let the anger start to brew
Let your instincts break the rules
Let it rise and consume you

Let the fire enter you
Let the anger start to brew
Let it rise and consume
Everything you do
Give in to yourself
