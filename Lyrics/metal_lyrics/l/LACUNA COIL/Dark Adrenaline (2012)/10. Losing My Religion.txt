[originally by R.E.M.]Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
(The distance in your eyes)
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
(I've set it up)

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
I'm losing my religion
Trying to keep up a view
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper 
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why
I think I thought I saw you try

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said, and now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
