[Bonus Track]So many times I wished I couldâve walked away,
Spread my wings into the sky, let myself go.
Opening this big heart to freedom once again,
that I can heal the strife, I will start again from here.

The fury breaks into the circle, unrestrained Iâm leashing out.
I wonât die, I get on my knees, think above all you, I will walk alone.

So many times, against the innocent in me,
gates abutment to locked tight, my SOUL IN-MATE
Iâm running out of hope, itâs caving in on me,
no time to say Goodbye, now Iâm setting myself free

The fury breaks into the circle, unrestrained Iâm breaking out.
I wonât die, I get on my knees, think above all you, I will walk alone.

Like heavy shadows in the jungle, none of them will move along.
Feel you break into the circle, unrestrained Iâm Freaking out.

I wonât die, I get on my knees, think above all you, I will walk alone.
I will walk alone, I will alone, I will walk alone
