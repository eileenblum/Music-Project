The smile on my face is burning
I cannot keep it on long enough 
I want to hide myself from something that's bigger than me
That I cannot control

I wanted you to help protect me
To keep me sane in my sanity
Confronting the evidence to run away from it
Just when I needed you most

I want to say it now
'Cause I don't believe in tomorrow
The storm is raging now
'Cause I lost my faith in you
I want to have it now
'Cause I don't believe in tomorrow
Avenge what I know now
'Cause I have no faith in you

I will rise from the ashes again
You can call me up, but I'm still the same
So don't even try to figure me out
It's too late
Oh

If I'm too complicated leave now 
'Cause I could easily be without you
I bury all the noise
Because I just feel like I'm trusting in more

I want to say it now
'Cause I don't believe in tomorrow 
The storm is raging now
'Cause I lost my faith in you
I want to have it now
'Cause I don't believe in tomorrow
Avenge what I know now
'Cause I have no faith in you

I'll avenge you, I'll avenge you, I'll avenge you
I'll avenge you, I'll avenge you, I'll avenge you
I'll avenge you, I'll avenge you, I avenge you (you!)

I want to say it now
'Cause I don't believe in tomorrow
The storm is raging now
'Cause I lost my faith in you
I want to have it now
'Cause I don't believe in tomorrow
Avenge what I know now
'Cause I have no faith in you.
