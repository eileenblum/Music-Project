You've built your life
Above the sin
You hold my hand
Before the end comes
Forgiving me for what I've done till the end of days

Cause I belong to you
Cause I am part of you
I am dying in your arms
It's time to go, I can make it trough

I've come to realise
Tonight my dear the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I can feel you and
I think that everything you wanted in me
Was the mirror of your dreams
But I couldn't believe what you'd say

As I belong to you
My flesh and blood in you
I am burning in this fire
It's time to go
I can't make it through

I've come to realise
Tonight my dear the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I've come to realise
Tonight my friend the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I'm coming home again
And now I know where I belong
Reeling from my instincts
Cause I realise I'm not alone

I've come to realize
Tonight my dear the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives

I've come to realise
Tonight my friend the end of time
Is not so far away
We cannot pray to save our lives
