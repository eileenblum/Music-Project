Lie!
Lie!

Broken mirror
Seven years of stolen luck
I try to fix you one more time but I must let it die
The dream that we'd survive, cut my throat if I tell a lie

Set it free, lost ambition
I overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I gave up on this fairy tale lie

Blind man's wisdom
Cross my heart but it's a lie
I kept us going the last time
You used one of your nine lives
I gave up all of mine, cut my throat if I tell a lie

Set it free, lost ambition
I overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I gave up on this fairy tale lie

In the world that I created, I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created, I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created, I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created, I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created, I'm intoxicated
In the world that I created, I'm intoxicated

Set it free, lost ambition and now I won't look back
I've turned my back, I'm off the ground
Set it free, superstition
And now the air I breathe is poison free
I'm freedom bound

Set it free, lost ambition
I overthought my place in your life
Set it free, superstition
I gave up on this fairy tale lie
