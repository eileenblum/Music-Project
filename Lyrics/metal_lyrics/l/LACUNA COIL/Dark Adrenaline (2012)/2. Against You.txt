No more rain, and no more hate
As I am sick of lies, and i have no respect
You have failed
You're underestimating my surprise of agony and pain

I'm no saint, butâ¦

I, I can't live this way, I cannot relate
I retaliate against you

Once again, I am the revolution that you cannot feel
The prize you cannot win
You stained my life and painted everything in black and blood
I'm not your portrait anymore

I'm no saint butâ¦

I, I can't live this way, I cannot relate
I retaliate against you

I cannot relate
I retaliate against you

I, can't live this way, I cannot relate
I retaliate against you

I can't live this way (I can't live this way)
I cannot relate (I cannot relate)
I retaliate (I retaliate)

I can't live this way
