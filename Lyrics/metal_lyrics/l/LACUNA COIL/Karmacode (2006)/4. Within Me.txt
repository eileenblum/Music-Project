Something about you that makes me feel bad
I wasn't there when a thin line destroyed your soul
I search every corner there's nowhere to hide how I feel
Ignorance
Sacrifice
Some days it's harder
Let's face it, it's all about me
Deeply into your own
Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
I'm leading myself to be free in this eternal goodbye

Something about you will make me stronger
Now I'm aware when a man falls
Rebound, My fault
I search every corner
Just nowhere to hide how I feel
Ignorance
Sacrifice
Some days it's harder
Let's face it, it's all about me
Deeply into your own
Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
I'm leading myself to be free in this eternal goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye here I wanna be no more lies!
