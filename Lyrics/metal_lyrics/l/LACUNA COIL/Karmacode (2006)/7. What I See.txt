Hear what I say
I'm gonna get out of my mind
Where I'm going to be on your way
Your spirit is calling after
Will I disappear?
Everything dies, nothing to worry about
Everything goes on, goes on, goes on

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?

See what I see
I'm going to get out of my mind
What am I going to. no more, no more
I'm ready to go serene to find
There's nothing to hold to reach you
Everything dies, nothing to worry about
Everything goes on, goes on, goes on

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?
