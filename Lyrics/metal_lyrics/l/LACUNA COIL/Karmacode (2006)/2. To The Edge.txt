Here I start to define it
As a sign on my skin
That I just try to wash away
Reminder infected, it'll be painful to me

Life is so short
Close to the edge of another backdoor
Life is so sure!
...Life will be ready to twist up your world

Here it starts to enlighten
There's a frame I can't change
That I just have to watch again
Reminder repressed inside me
It keeps repeating

Life is so short
Close to the edge of another backdoor
Life is so sure!

...Life will be ready to twist up your world
Close to the edge
