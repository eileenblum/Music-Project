Will I just tell you to give up?
No matter how you'll play this game
But I can handle the sorrow
Whatever time is running out

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relieving my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind

Will I be such a dreamer?
No matter how I'll play this game
To get is symptom of giving
Whatever time is over now

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relieving my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relieving my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind
