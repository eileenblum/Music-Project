It's not the way to cross the faith
The promise has been broken
My disease, everlasting
Let me bleed forever
I have to wait
Come and get me
Lost in here, I'm nothing
Tie my hands
Let me feel alive one more time

Where is the pain?
Somewhere down

Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?
Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?

My halo fades
Sin is calling
The promise has been stolen
My disease, everlasting
Let me dream forever
My soul to take
Come and get it
Lost in here, I'm nothing
Tie my hands
Let me feel alive one more time

Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?
Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?

Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?
Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?

Never let it go.

Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?
Can you feel it?
Don't you know there is no time?
