I'll be there when there's nothing left.
And night and day, holding you.
Harmony, deep inside your soul.
Meet me there.

Can you feel me?
(Can you feel me?)
Can you feel me deep inside?

There's no time to deny that I need you.
And I'll be there to repair your delightful days.
There's no time to deny that I need you.
That's why I'll be there to relieve your painful days.

Hiding well where the pain is real.
Night and day, growing you.
In the haze, poison in your veins.
Meet me there.

Can you feel me?
(Can you feel me?)
Can you feel me deep inside?

There's no time to deny that I need you.
And I'll be there to repair your delightful days.
There's no time to deny that I need you.
That's why I'll be there to relieve your painful days.

Deep inside.

There's no time to deny that I need you.
And I'll be there to repair your delightful days.
There's no time to deny that I need you.
That's why I'll be there to relieve your painful days.
