Something about you that makes me feel bad
I wasnât there when a thin line destroyed your soul
I search every corner
Thereâs nowhere to hide
How I feel ignorance
Sacrifice some days itâs harder
Letâs face it, itâs all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Lifeâs crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
Iâm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye

Something about you will make me stronger
Now Iâm aware when a man falls rebound, my fault
I search every corner
Just nowhere to hide
How I feel ignorance
Sacrifice some days itâs harder
Letâs face it, itâs all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Lifeâs crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
Iâm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye

Here I wanna be
No more lies!

Deep within me
Lifeâs crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
Iâm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye
