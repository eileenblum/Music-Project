What is it for?
What is sacred?
In my circle of regrets
circle of regrets

today I'm drawing circles
in my memory, in the pages of my life

That's me for a long time
I can't run away... (long time)

These stone tears are falling down on me, all my regrets
my regrets (I don't want this feeling)

I need more
all I want is to break
my circle of regrets
circle of regrets

Is there any solution?
I want to find the way to escape... to go away
