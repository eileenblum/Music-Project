Close your eyes
don't you feel the rejection, baby?
Does it hurt?
Come here now
I've got something to tell you, honey...
I don't want you back

Won't you take me back
won't you take me back with you
won't you take me back
won't you wrap me with your love again...

Get out of my life
I know I've failed you, but I'll make it up
get out of my life
I know I failed you, just let me try again

You're to blame
I'm no more you business

Can't you see I'm praying
for your forgiveness

Shut your mouth
I don't need your affection, darling
does it hurt?
Come here now
I've got something to tell you, honey...
I don't want you back

I will do anything you want
but hold me forever
be a nightmare in my sleep
scare me forever
like a bullet in my soul
kill me forever
all the lies I have sold to you
are sour thorns in my mouth
