I just need you absolutely
all the fears in your mind
I just want you absolutely
to sail this ship of mine

I don't know what the hell you're saying
'cause you're going blind
using all the lies they told you
to hurt your mind

And I can breathe now...

It's there, pretends to be a guide for you
like a candle in the dark
lies like a really cold breeze in the air
step by step you'll lose your faith

I just need you miserably
broken man come to me
I just need you desperately
just want to change your mind
