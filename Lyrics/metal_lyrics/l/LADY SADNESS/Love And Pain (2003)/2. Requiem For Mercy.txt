In the thorny garden,
Another rose is chocked,
Killed by stolen memories
Of nightly past desires...
Hear the bell that toll
A silent melody.
Embraces seems so hollow...

Lick my open wounds,
A fallen rose is dead,
Memories of winter
The cold has covered.
Scarlet are the walls
That build the house of pain.
I feel flies in my heart...

Iâve lost my faith in you...

Requiem for mercy
You took this part of me...
Requiem for mercy
This final kiss for us...
