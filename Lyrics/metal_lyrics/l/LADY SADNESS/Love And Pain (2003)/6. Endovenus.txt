Venus without words,
Unspeakable thoughts...
Feeling far from home,
Wanting only love...

Come into my eyes,
Come into my sleepless nights,
Come into my arms...
Endovenus...

Never felt this way before (oh, before)
I cry I feel your pain...
In your heart thereâs empty love (empty love)
And they will never burn...

Now I take your hand,
The coldest that Iâve felt...
And I see in the end,
That now is too late...

Come into my eyes,
Come into my sleepless nights,
Come into my arms...
Endovenus...

In your heart thereâs empty love (empty love)
Your eyes are tired, youâre dyindg...
Anymore...
Now I cry... for you my lady...
