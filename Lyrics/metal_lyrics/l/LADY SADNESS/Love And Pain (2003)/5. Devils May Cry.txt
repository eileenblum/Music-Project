Now thereâs the moonlight
And I think what Iâd want find
Before the light,
âcause my failed sleep is on my mind.

My girlâs in love
With a man tired and old...
Sheâs burning inside,
But my heart now is still cold...

One night
Iâll open my eyes
Iâd want to find
The strenght of the man to cry...

Now is still night
And I see in the dark your eyes,
Flashing my heart
With a love that kill every lie.
Iâm screaming inside,
I got pearl-tears down my spine...
Standing a while
I can see a man who cries...

This night
I opened my eyes
And now Iâve found
A tear lost into my eyes...

And now Iâve found
A tear lost into my eyes...
