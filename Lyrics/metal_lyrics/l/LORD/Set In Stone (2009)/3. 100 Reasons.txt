The future's bright I tell you
Another perfect day
All our baggage packed we climb
Aboard this sinking ship
And so we sail...

Takes a second to say hello
And forever to say goodbye
Turn the cheek of a blind denial
Into another lie

[Pre-chorus:]
Oh, playing out this masquerade
Hold on to the dream
How long can we travel down this road we made?
Go on alone and leave me far behind

[Chorus:]
I tell myself we're all okay
(I can) think of a hundred different reasons
For me to make you stay
I leave you now and go my way
To find a change of season
To help me get my feet back on the ground

Inside it's so frustrating
A heart wrapped in golden chain
Always searching for the rainbow
Always waiting in the rain

[Repeat pre-chorus]

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: LT]

[Repeat pre-chorus]

[Repeat chorus out]
