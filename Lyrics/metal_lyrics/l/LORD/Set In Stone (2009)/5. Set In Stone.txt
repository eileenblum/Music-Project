Staring out beyond the shadows
To see a world of faces all the same
And find the light behind those darkened eyes
And realise the skies are more than grey

[Pre-chorus:]
Got the hunger but we're wanting more
Forever reaching higher
Remember what we're fighting for
The writing on the wall is

[Chorus:]
Set In Stone
Set In Stone

Ghosts of the past now far behind me
Follow the path towards a brighter day
Now a fire lights inside those darkened eyes
Crucify the lies of yesterday

[Repeat pre-chorus]

[Repeat chorus x 2]

[Solo: LT / LT / Mark / LT / Mark]

[Repeat pre-chorus]

[Repeat chorus x 4 + ad libs]
