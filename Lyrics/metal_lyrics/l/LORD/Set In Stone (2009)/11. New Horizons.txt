Another city passes in the darkness
Another country come and gone
And on this never ending road I wander
Seems like I'm always on the run

[Chorus 1:]
So long ago
I chose this lonely road
To follow new horizons
So far to roam
A million miles from home
So many more to go...

In another life I could have been the everyman
Another tale untold for me
Cursed by the gypsy's kiss and driven onward
To reap the winds, forever free

[Chorus 2:]
So long ago
I chose this lonely road
To follow new horizons
So far to roam
But one thing I know
One day I'll find that road
That takes me home

[Solo: LT / Pete Lesperance]

Another plane, another train
Another thousand miles of road
And one more day, I'll find my way
Home to you...

Now I sit here waiting in the darkness
My thoughts a million miles away
Of all the things I've done, all the sights and wonder
Not one thing could make me stay (one more day)

[Repeat chorus 2 x2]

[Solo: LT]
