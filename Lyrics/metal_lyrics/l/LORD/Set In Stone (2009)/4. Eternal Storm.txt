Vision born of dream-like lucid flames
Crimson light mastered by faceless names
Burning passion or a timeless force
Voices speak of shadows rising forth

[Pre-chorus:]
Once were dreaming
Now are living
Feel the rain begin to pour
Hear the wind lift off and soar

[Chorus:]
Eternal storm
Restless souls
Eternal storm
Restless souls embrace the dying dawn

Nightmares destroying mortality
Creating dreamscape reality
Lost and forgotten our spirit sought
Forced upon us ways of lifeless thought

[Repeat pre-chorus]

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Mark]

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Mark]
