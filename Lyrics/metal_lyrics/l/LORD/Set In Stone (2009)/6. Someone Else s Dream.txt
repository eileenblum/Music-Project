On this dark road I tread
Of despair and regret
Some days you long to forget
Searching for the light

Taking life one step at a time
Walk a path that's only mine
Shit happens, a kick to the teeth
So look out for number one

Some say I'm just a selfish man
I say take hold of what you can
Learn to swim before you drown
Before life kicks you down

[Chorus:]
On the seas of life I sail
To find my way
And never to return
No self betrayal
I won't live my life
Living someone else's dream

Some may say this pain is just an illusion
Some say it's all in your mind
Life builds us up to be proud
Then cuts you down like an empty lie

Find yourself in this tunnel again
See the light: (is it) just another train?
Finding shelter from the endless rain
Sometimes you find yourself
Always asking why...

I drag myself to my feet
And take what's rightly mine

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Mark / LT]

[Repeat first and second verse]

[Repeat chorus]
