I'd walk to the end of the world
I'd do anything
Just to see you, to be near you
Feel you close for a moment

And I'm lost in your eyes
Charmed by your sweet smile
Lips that beckon, I count the seconds
'Til I see you again...

Get to know you
Want to show you I care
I'll make you see how good we'd be
Together, so perfect

Feel so lonely
Oh, if only I could
Dare to meet you, touch you, but you
Don't even know I'm alive...

[Chorus:]
Together and never apart, my love
We were meant to be
And you'll always have my heart
Our love is forever

Tried to speak to you
Tried to meet you but you
Looked right through me, just ignored me
As if I was no one

Now my world's upside down
Is there someone else?
How can this be? You don't want me?
In my mind it's all so crystal clear

[Repeat chorus]

"I tried to show you that I care
That we were meant to be
But you don't want me
You were everything to me and I'm nothing to you
Well, if I can't have you, then... no one can."

[Solo: LT / Mark]

And now you lay here before me
In the pallid light
I have blood on my hands
Your face a mask of white

No respite for my memory
As I stumble and run
And my mind is in turmoil
What have I done? WHAT HAVE I DONE?!

I return to your side
And you lay there so beautiful, yet so still
I could almost believe you were sleeping

Can't bear this world without you
So clear what I have to do
The choice is made, I raise the blade
My love, I'll be with you soon

[Repeat chorus x 2]
