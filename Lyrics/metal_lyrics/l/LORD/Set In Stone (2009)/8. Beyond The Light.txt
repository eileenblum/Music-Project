A heart strong with fire
The measure that I aspire
Living your life abounding
Like few others do

Torn from this world premature
Lost to all those who cared
I'm left behind alone to find my way

Now I look to the skies
Memories: rising tides
I feel a part of me died
The day you went away

Gone to a place never known
Free of sadness and pain
Brotherhood, the memories still remain

[Chorus:]
So wherever, wherever you may be
I hope forever you'll be proud of me
So my brother, someday, I don't know when
One day, together we will meet again
Far beyond the light

[Solo: Mark]

And as time marches on
This heartache will always linger
I'll shed a tear for you
On those sleepless nights

No matter where I may roam
I feel your presence so near
Gives me strength to see tomorrow's dawn

[Repeat chorus]
