Oh no, the circle turns again
So low, return to play pretend

And so much time has gone
The years have passed us by (time and time again)
Still the songâs the same
Believe our own true lies

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Oh, now times have changed, rearranged
Become estranged (turn the pages again)
And weâll never be the same again

[CHORUS:]
When a promise is betrayed
And we turn to walk away (from the life we had)
A choice youâve made
And youâve gone where I canât follow
Like the passing of the days
Things will never be the same (as the time we had)
Now itâs time to say goodbye
And walk away

No grow, we stay the same, yet expecting change again
So go, this charade must come to its end

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO: LT]

Oh no, the circle turns again
So low, return face the end

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
