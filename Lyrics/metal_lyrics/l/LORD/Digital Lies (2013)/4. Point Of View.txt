Today the world can go to hell you say
An angry life for angry times
And all around conspiracies
When life is out to kick you down
No chance, just dance â a puppet on a string

And you see your world through cold jaded eyes
All the beauty and wonderment is gone
There can be no joy â all darkness without light
At the dayâs end you know thereâs something wrong

[CHORUS 1:]
The path you take is up to you
Canât you see your life is waiting
Light and dark â a point of view
Understand this plan is at your command
Your fate in your hands or be damned

Today is gonna be a perfect day
A smile and goodwill all around
Ignoring plain reality
Wonât let the bastards bring you down
You feel, unreal â gloss-over everything

And you see your world through rose shaded eyes
All the beauty and wonderment adorn
There will be all joy â no darkness only light
At the dayâs end you know thereâs something wrong

[CHORUS 2:]
The path you take is up to you
Canât you see your life is waiting
Light and dark â a point of view
Understand this plan is all in your hands

The life you make is up to you
And youâll see a new world is waiting
And good or bad â a point of view
Understand this plan is at your command
Your fate in your hands or be damned

[SOLO: LT / MARK / LT]

Today is just another normal day
Where good and bad can come to anyone
Dumb luck and no conspiracies
No false pretense to guide my way
Thatâs life, thatâs right â I know itâs up to me
And I see my world through unclouded eyes
All the cruelty and wonderment unbound
And the key is balance, no darkness without light
At the dayâs end Iâve known it all along

[REPEAT CHORUS 2]
