We think we know the answers
Itâs there in black and white for all to see
Yet look beyond the madness
Another truth, another world for you and me

Show you open doors
To use your mind and think
Lead you to the shore
To the water, but you have to want to drink
And once I too was blinded
Believing what was told for all to hear
Weâre all so simple-minded
Another lie, another life controlled by fear

Show you open thoughts
Oppression now defied
Reveal the truth, distraught
At the prophecy, our journeyâs end is nigh

Condemn the crazy man
His eyes are filled with sadness
With chalkboard prophecy
Foretold, we turn away

[SOLO: LT]

Just walk on by
Donât stare, donât look him in the eye
His ranting insane, profane
Just turn and walk away

Heâs seen on every city corner
A human wreck, around his neck a chalkboard sign
But is he mad or sent to warn us
To take control and save us all before itâs time

Tolling of the bell
A final desperate plea
Heed the tale he tells
I know the truth, that crazy man is me

Condemn the crazy man
His eyes are filled with sadness
With chalkboard prophecy
Foretold, we turn away

Heâs just a crazy man
His mind is lost in madness
Are we too blind to see
That heâs the one whoâs sane?
