The day has come, out of time
Journeyâs end â itâs the end of the line
A time for tears, to face your fears
Retrace the years, here by fate or by design

[PRE-CHORUS 1:]
Will you stare back in sorrow
Or remember the smiles and the sighs
So farewell everyone
One look back now the race is all but run
End of day, no more to say
Accept your fate
Or do you pray itâs some mistake

[PRE-CHORUS 2:]
Be it leading or follow
Face the truth, were you all you should be

[CHORUS:]
In the final seconds of your life
Will you cry or fly

As you walk into the light
âSo take meâ
One last reflection on your time
As it fades away
And you face your last tomorrow
Forever
Your time has come

[SOLO: LT / MARK]

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS 1]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
