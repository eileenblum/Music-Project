âIt was a massacre that forever stands as a deathly warning to all civilised kingdoms. The unification of the clans to claim vengeance for the sins of the western nations marked the beginning of a life driven by a destiny known only to the godsâ¦â

Born to lead, fated to be king
A dying breed, death amidst the din
Beyond these years, fifteen winters seen
Rising fears, Cimmerian war machine
Forces rage, the land of blackened skies
Ruthless pride, blood lust battle cries
Steel descends, wet blades will sanctify
Invasions end, this horror justified

Fate unseen, outraged theyâll bleed
Hate resounds, as one theyâll drown

Darkness soars on wingless flight, devouring the daytime light
Creeping through the northern haze, intensifying warring ways

âThe barbarians emerged from the dark lands to destroy the invaders in ways never before seenâ¦â

[SOLO: MARK]

âWith sword in hand and strength ingrained, a conqueror amongst them strode forth with the aura of a king, destined for greatnessâ¦â

Fate unseen, outraged theyâll bleed
Hate resounds, as one theyâll drown

Darkness soars on wingless flight, devouring the daytime light
Creeping through the northern haze, intensifying warring ways
Reigning down this shadowed form, resurrection god reborn
Illusions of a grand empire, mocking this now dead desire
