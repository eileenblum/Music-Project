Tonight thereâs a spark in the air
The last curtain call
With crowd growing restless
I take to the stage
To the cheers of their great enthrall

Under the fervid gaslights
The pleasure and pain
Reciting line after line from the heart
This moment unseen again

[PRE-CHORUS 1:]
Oh, itâs so long ago, it all feels like yesterday
The thrill of the show, this chill never goes away, no
The roar of the crowd, the agony and ecstasy
That was then, this is now
Now itâs goneâ¦

[CHORUS:]
Iâm walking through a moonless night
Keep searching for a new spotlight
And everyday it takes all my might
To make it through to morning light, oh
It must be two hundred years on
The years lost in time
Gets harder with each passing day to recall
The day that I died

[PRE-CHORUS 2:]
Oh, itâs so long ago, it all feels like yesterday
The chill, itâs like snow, the cold never fades away, no
In a heartbeat, a breath, all stolen away from me
A man, once with dream, once with life
Now itâs goneâ¦

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
And we all turned to bow, it was glorious
Iâd give all I have for one just last encoreâ¦

[SOLO: LT (acoustic) / LT / MARK]

[PRE-CHORUS 3:]
Oh, itâs so long ago, it all feels like yesterday
The thrill of the show, this chill never goes away, no
In a heartbeat, a breath, all stolen away from me
A man, once with dream, once with life
Now itâs goneâ¦

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x]
