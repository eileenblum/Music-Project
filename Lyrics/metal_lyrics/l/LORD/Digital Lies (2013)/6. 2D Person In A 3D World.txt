Got a metal suit and brutal tie
Throw the horns at all who pass you by
Off to work, you bang your head
Rock all day then itâs off to brutal bed

Youâre more metal than me
You drift away to steel dreams
The one thing thatâs harder than you
Is how hard you tryâ¦

[CHORUS:]
I donât ever want to be
Someone else untrue to me
Just a parody
And be a 2D person in a 3D world
Never buy into the hype
Always follow what feels right
Become the archetype
And not a 2D person in a 3D world

Got your pants down low and your hood up high
Wrapped up tight, your golden chains they shine
Itâs forty degrees on a summerâs day
Your skin white as the snow so far away

Youâre more hardcore than me
Crusinâ to your Rân'B
Youâre so ill dope and fly
Youâre from the west sideâ¦ of Bankstown

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Donât care if youâreâ¦
Black white, Tall short, Thin fat
Or care if youâreâ¦
Gay straight, Boy girl, Rich poor
Or even if youâreâ¦
Hardcore, raver, punk rock, metalhead
Gamer geek, Jesus freak, Atheist
Or have aâ¦
Big house, rich friends, fast car, ten guitars
Youâre still a douche!

[SOLO: LT]

[BRIDGE:]
So like what you like
Be proud of who you are
But you look like a fool
When you take it too farâ¦

[REPEAT CHORUS 2x]
