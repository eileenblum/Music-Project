Deception, a hollow victory
Raging, in murderous fury
Reflection, a jester devil sent
Parading, marauding malcontent

[PRE-CHORUS:]
âI march on, through the chaos of my affliction
Remain strong, against inciters of sedition
I stand tall, amongst agents of iniquity
If I fall, Iâll rise to reclaim my destinyâ

[CHORUS:]
Betrayal blind, believer of a lie
The fire died, no longer can I fight
An end in sight, breathing in new life
The darkest night, dreaming of the light

Inception, born of blackening
Engaging, vehement war within
Deflection, shadowing of mind
Denying, echoing through time

[REPEAT PRE-CHORUS]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO: MARK]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
