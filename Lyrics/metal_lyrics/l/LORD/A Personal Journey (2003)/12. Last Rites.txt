One flash - I see my life in front of me
One crash - it's fading from my mind
A journey incomplete, I was brought back from the light
Is this a destiny of fire? 

How can this be?
I'm lying in front of me
Family and friends are gathered around
I scream
But no one can can hear me
Surrounded by people I know but so alone... 

I'm watching from the other side
Bound to this flesh that clings to life... To life... 

Can't return - beyond the help of anyone
Can't move on - so much is left undone
Can't break out - set me free
So do what must be done - How can I make you see? 

So many days here by my side
So many nights I sit and cry
Can you see me?
Can't you hear me call your name? 

Sometimes I'm sure that you can see
It's like you're staring (back at me)
But you walk away, walk away...
Oh, can't you hear my cries? 

I see the world in a different light
I hear the words of those that think they have the right
The right to make a choice that isn't theirs to make
Playing God
They can never hope to ever understand... 

Pull the plug, flick the switch
Let me leave this life of hell
Let me die in my own way - it's my right 

They say it's wrong - they can't see
They'd do the same if they were me
It's time to set me free... 

It's time to go
It's time to leave - it's time to say goodbye
It's time to go
It's time to leave - and walk into the light 

It's time to go
You will know I'll be waiting for you on the other side
It's time to go
It's time to leave - goodbye.....
