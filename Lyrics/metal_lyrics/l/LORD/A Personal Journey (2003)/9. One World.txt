Our world is crying
Our children die in our arms
A life of hunger and disease 

So are we trying?
A million miles away
Another day and no one cares... 

If we see beyond illusion
We'll see we only have one world... 

Our world is dying
And we watch with jaded eyes
This silent cancer, apathy 

Turn your back, denial
'til the day we pay with our lives
Wake up - it's real, not some crazy dream... 

If we see beyond illusion
We'll see we only have one... 

One world, one life, one chance
To make things right
One heart, one mind - stop and think
Don't leave this world behind... 

So rise above your scandalous lives
Rise above your greed
If we open our eyes to look beyond ourselves
One day we'll see.... We'll see there's just one world... 

One world, one life, one chance
To make things right
One heart, one mind, so be strong
Don't ever stop the fight 

One world, one life, one chance
To make things right
One day we'll see - we'll stop and think
We won't leave this world behind...
