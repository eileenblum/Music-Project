He lived long ago in innocent times
When all seemed clear and right
A singer of songs, a teller of tales
The bringer of light 

But he was shunned
Betrayed by the ones he once called his own
As once they did he
They promised him love, they offered their gold
Then turned him away... 

In the cold - They turned him away
Far from home - He's travelling far from home... 

He left for a land to follow his dreams
Far from his home
A stranger he was but they still took him in
Like one of their own kind 

Where once was seen as a curse
His difference was praised, a gift loved by all
Small minds in his own homeland
Hypocrisy burns
Forever he's turning his back on them... 

And the story goes on, it's not just a tale
It's happening now
So open your eyes and open your hearts
And embrace what is yours...
