Tonight - my spirit dances like an angel in the flames
While my body lay alone
I can fly outside of time
Where we all exist, all free to roam... 

Seeing tomorrow today
Every step of the way
(Is this) just a role that we play? 

Like footsteps in the sand
It sometimes seems we're following
A destiny that's planned
Predetermined lives... 

I see the choice is mine
A million ways, a million dreams
A twisted path through time
The story still untold, the future now unfolds... 

Like Deja Vu and future dreams we have in stranger days
Icy fingers rake down your spine
The answer lies beyond our reach
Lies within subconscious minds 

Thousands of ways yet to go
So much more left to grow
Leave this path that we know...
