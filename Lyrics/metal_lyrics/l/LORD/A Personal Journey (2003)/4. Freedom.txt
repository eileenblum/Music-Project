Betrayer, you've had your last chance
So enjoy your tainted prize
On a night such as this
When the moonlight's kiss means goodbye 

The tables have turned and the rules don't apply
And you will know sacrifice
Now we've come to the time
When the lion becomes the lamb 

No more control, no judgment toll
My life is my own
No more "can't see", no more "can't be"
Now I'm free... 

We know these are magical times
Creation that begs for release
Now I wander the world
And I walk through the fire alone 

The choices are mine, my voice is my own
The secret revealed - mine to know:
Belief in yourself is the key
It keeps your heart strong 

Call it ego, I call it self-respect
I believe I deserve much more than this
That place that we know deep inside our hearts
Follow your dreams and forever you'll be free...
