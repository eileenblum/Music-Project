Old eyes stare beyond these lonely walls
Out toward the sea
In a darkened room, he sits and thinks of
All that might have been 

Sure - there's regrets
But he wouldn't change a thing 

He had it all and lost it all
But the memories remain
To you and me he may not seem a wealthy man (but)
If this is what we're really worth
He'd be the richest man on earth... 

A young man so long ago, so full of hope
Of what he may become
Never scared to take a risk, a life so full
Would someday come undone... 

So, roll the dice
'Cos the future isn't clear...
