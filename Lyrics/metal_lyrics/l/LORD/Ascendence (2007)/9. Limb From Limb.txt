Fueling the anger inside
The rage starts to break
Reaching the end of my line
It's all I can take
This hunger for justice I crave
A thirst for revenge
So beg for remorse, for your life
As it comes to an end

Oh, no more time, no more words for me to say
Oh, a time for action, time for you to pay
I'll tear you...

[Chorus:]
Limb from limb - you thrust the dagger deep in my back
Limb from limb - you crossed the line the day you stood in front of me
Limb from limb - say your prayers, it's time for payback
Limb from limb - don't stand in my way or I'll tear you limb from limb

Pathetic excuse for a man
You're lower than swine
Betrayer, deceiver and coward
Born with no spine
Believing your own hype
Drunk on your ego and power
Now beg for your life
As you're torn from your ivory tower

Oh, no more time, no more words for me to say
Oh, a time for action, time for you to pay
I'll tear you...

[Chorus]

[Solos: LT]

Feeling my hate penetrate
Your inhumane soul
Feeling your strength dissipate
You're losing control
Down on your knees like a dog
No time to reject
Spit in your face
Now you feel the same disrespect

Limb from limb - you thrust the dagger deep in my back
Limb from limb - you crossed the line the day you stood in front of me
Limb from limb - say your prayers, it's time for payback
Limb from limb...
Don't stand in my way, I'll warn you now
Get out of my way or I'll tear you limb from limb
