It seems like a long time ago
Felt the sun on my face
A life lived with so much regret
There has to be a better place

A bitter wind, an empty skin
Of all once held true
Searching for reasons I wonder if
Time can heal these wounds

A path that's well worn, returned here again
Once more, oh I'm unsure I'll find another road
Sometimes in finding your way, you lose yourself
When the mirror's eye shows the face of a stranger

[Chorus:]
I'm hearing the same old lines
Don't tell me it's true when you look in my eyes
Keep telling the same old lies...

An ever broken dream
Crushed again and again
Should we lie or a truth be told
As a means unto an end?

A path that's well worn, returned here again
But this time, oh now I know I'll find another road
A way to believe, a way back to me
But I know that this sadness will stay forever

[Chorus]
