The story over
The final chapter
Laid to rest
And said our last goodbyes

They say we come from nothing
And return to nothing
Dust to dust
That fairy tale is nothing but a lie

We all search for meaning
In an age of reason
Before our eyes the prize
That very few can see

To live for now and ever
Past ties are ripped and severed
Break the chains and claim
Our immortality

Thrown from the precipice
Cast to damnation
For new life: a sacrifice
Old life must die
Oh, yet the spirit still remains...

Challenge obsolete ideals
Deconstruct reality
Recreate the world around me
I will be reborn
Leave forgotten sins behind
Resurrect my will to be
I arise for my ascendence
I will be reborn

Look past naive delusions
To see a new day
Oh, a place with no confusion
So take me away...

[Solos: LT]

Torn from the chrysalis
Raging with hunger
Emerge from the funeral pyre
The Phoenix arise

Thrown from the precipice
Cast to damnation
For new life: a sacrifice
Old life must die
Oh, yet the spirit still remains...

Challenge obsolete ideals
Deconstruct reality
Recreate the world around me
I will be reborn
Leave forgotten sins behind
Resurrect my will to be
Beyond the sacrifice

Arise.... I will be reborn
