And when the daylight falls to grey
When even twilight fades
In the darkest veil of night
We stray

It seems this road will never end
Watch our trust decay
As sacred memories turn to dust
And drift away

Can you hear me now?
Hear me calling you?
Can you see my eyes?
These tears that fall for you

You know you've always been a friend
Through even lightless days
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
Times change

But can you hear me now?
Hear me calling you?
So look in my eyes
Believe my words to you are true

[Chorus:]
Oh, I'll never turn my back on you
To go my own way
You'll never walk alone
To face the darkness
Oh, for all the pain that we've been through
Together
And you'll always have a home
Deep inside my heart

So many years have passed us by
A chance to start again
And hope that time will heal these wounds
Someday

So can you hear me now?
Hear me calling you?
So look in my eyes
Believe my words to you are true

[Chorus]
