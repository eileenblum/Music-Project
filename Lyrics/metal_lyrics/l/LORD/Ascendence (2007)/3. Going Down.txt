"Judge me for who I am
Don't like me for what I'm not"

In every aspect of my life
Talk the talk and take the blame
Stand up for what I feel is right
And feel no shame

I'm a sinner, but I'm a winner
Take no shit from anyone
Speak my mind and do the time
For my views

[Chorus:]
Going down - I stand behind the choices I make
Going down - Be they wrong or right
Going down - I see fires of hell below me
Live and die an honest man
So take me away...

Every day another test
Run the gauntlet, walk the line
So live your life to be the best
Every time

Not a rebel or the devil
No false facade, I'm true to me
Stand up to the bastards
And know I'm free

[Solos: LT]

[Chorus x2]
