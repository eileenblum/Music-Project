Cast to my death in flames
But I will never die
Past life is burned away
Stronger man arise

I am shadow, I am light
I'm your world to be
I am angel, I'm your hell
I am me

Oh, so it seems like this world always changes
But I know what's coming for me
I see with open eyes
How things should be

[Chorus:]
Shed the skin of yesterday
My legacy begins again today
Live the dream that drives me on
My destiny, tomorrow will belong to me

I leave the blackness, walk into the shining light
Reach out for my dreams...

[Solos: LT]

Ascend from my trial by fire
Branded and torn
I wear my symbol proudly
Carved into my flesh
I walk the world
A free man

[Solos: LT]

My path now set in stone
As written so shall be
Rise up to claim the throne
Fulfill my destiny

I am angel, I am sin
I'm your Lord's decree
I am devil, I am light
I am me

Oh, so it seems like this world always changes
But I know what's coming for me
I see with open eyes
How things should be

[Chorus x2]
