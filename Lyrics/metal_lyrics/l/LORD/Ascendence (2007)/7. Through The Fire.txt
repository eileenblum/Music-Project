Watch another fortune fade away
Another dream cast to the wind
Chronos waits to seize the day
So play his game and play to win

[Chorus:]
Take hold of life - walk through the fire
Sometimes it seems like time is slipping away
Take hold of life - walk through the fire
Don't waste your life when time is slipping away

Like the golden goose that never lays
Always waiting for the sign
Time to see it's time to be
Release the hero, free to fly

[Chorus]

[Solo: Chris Brooks / LT / LT (harmony)]

Search inside to find the truth
Circumstance won't come to you
Be the one you want to be
Live your life to live your dreams

[Chorus x2]
