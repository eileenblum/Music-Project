[music: Damien Lempiere, lyrics: Catherine Lempiere]

Into hell's well
Beyond the edge of the black forest
Where trees burn, where birds and wolves
Servants of Lucifer, sing satanic incantations
Where daylight fades, seven oaks, seven bloody croses
Here's the gate to hell's well
Here's the beginning of your pain

If you fall into hell's well
thousands of fallen angels, servants of Lucifer
will drink your blood, eat your flesh and offer
your soul to their master, the bringer of light
This is your slow going to Hell

Into Hell's well, Lucifer will damn your soul
And you'll take the oath to serve the king of Hell
Your mission will be to destroy human weakings, human souls
Now you're haunting Hell's well
You are a fallen angel

If you fall into Hell's well
The seventh cross will be your emblem
Blood will be your wine
And Lucifer your master
