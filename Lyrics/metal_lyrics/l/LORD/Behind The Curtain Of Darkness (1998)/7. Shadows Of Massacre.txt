[music: Damien Lempiere, Catherine Lempiere, lyrics: Catherine Lempiere]

The fire is up the hill
The winds of destruction give you the eternal power
Warrior, evil and hate, pierce the heart of ypur enemy
with your mighty sword
Glory to war, glory to the immortal warrior

Listen to the messenger
"By the spirit of evil, in the northern misty forest
drink the blood of victory, weaking have to die
Death and destruction, your only might
Glory to the war, glory to the immortal warrior"

As the sun beyond the eastern mountains
Beyond the dark seas, The Shadows of Massace
The Flames of Conquest, the Wrath of Warfare
Honour the son of the mighty god of war
The Immortal Warrior
