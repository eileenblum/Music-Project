[music and lyrics: Catherine Lempiere]

Dark shadows over the graves
Deep silence only whispers
The Angel of Death is calling my name
Strange feelings, I'm gonna die

Midnight in the graveyard
The Black Lady, Queen of Hell
Wants me as her bloody lover
She's drawing me into the grave
I can't resist

Dead leaves over the path
I'm frozen, I must die in the name of Hell

Midnight in the graveyard
The Black Lady is rising from death
She's taking my soul

Black candles around my grave
Light up the shadow of the lady like a ghost
Queen of carnal pleasure
She takes me into the grave
I'm her eternal lover

Midnight in the graveyard
Oh, my lady, let me die
