[music: Damien Lempiere, Catherine Lempiere, lyrics: Catherine Lempiere]

Under the thunderstorm, under the lighting
The white wolf is roaring to death
Like sign of evil, gudied by lust and blood
He's wandering the black mountain
Searching for a bloody sacrifice

White wolf, King of Darkness
Majesty of Blood, Guardian of the Black Mountain

The full moon is up
Thirsty for blood, the white wolf obeys Satan
The Lord of fire, his master
White wolf, allegory od sacrifice and death
Torture and pain and starvation
The forest, deep and dark
The mountain, balck and cold
His territory for devilish sacrifices

White wolf, King of Darkness
Majesty of Blood, Guardian of the Black Mountain

Darkness, cold, wind, storm and fire
Call the white wolf
And the sacrifice shall begin

Like a call from the deepest darkness
