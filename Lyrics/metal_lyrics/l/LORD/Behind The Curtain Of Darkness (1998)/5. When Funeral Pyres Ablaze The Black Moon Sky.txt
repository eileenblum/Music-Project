[music: Catherine Lempiere, David Coeuret, lyrics: Damien Lempiere]

I've crossed a pact with Satan
When funeral pyres ablaze the black moon sky
Seven newborn children I've to kill
Seven chalices with blood I have to fill
Before the sun rises again

Under the blazing sjy, the barbarian horde
Sons of Lucifer await blood
Bloodthirst:
Then they will return to hell

I've crossed a pact with Satan
He gave me power and might
Wealth and imortality
So, holy weakings, be scared
I will desecrate you all
Now I'm your master

I've crossed a pact with Satan
When funeral pyres ablaze the black moon sky
Seven newborn children I've to kill
Seven chalices with blood I have to fill
But if I break the oath
To Hell I will go
In flames I will die
