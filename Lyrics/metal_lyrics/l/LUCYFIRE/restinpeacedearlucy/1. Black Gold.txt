My god is killing your god and it looks good on TV
In night vision they declare our absolute decree
On the 42 inch plasma screen; I watch the tears of Jesus
Crying âOur gods are dead and hacked into pieces"
A choir of ---- fills the temple hall
---- is pale and blood is dripping from the walls
It's the equinox of horror, it's everything I've seen
Then yet the blood ---- survive it on my screen

You're the black gold, you're the gasoline
You're the car at the launching, with fire in between
You're the (ha ha ha ha) the hammer of the gods
The perimeter is sealed and now the savages are healed by blood
You're the black gold, you're the black gold, c'mon
(It's raining black gold from heaven)
You're the black gold, you're the black gold, c'mon, c'mon now
(It's raining black gold from heaven)

Give arms to the pacifists and alms to the poor
Let the evil in the house and kick the good out through the door
Let the tenderloin steak soak in virgin table salt
And may the killing of the innocent be killing for a cause!
And may the red with white ----
And may we lay down as a dog and let 'em tell you what to do
And may we get away with murder, every now and then
And may the smart bombs never fall on little children

You're the black gold, you're the gasoline
You're the car at the launching, with fire in between
You're the (ha ha ha ha) the hammer of the gods
The perimeter is sealed and now the savages are healed by blood
You're the black gold, you're the black gold c'mon
(It's raining black gold from heaven)
You're the black gold, you're the black gold c'mon, c'mon now
(It's raining black gold from heaven)
(Ha ha ha ha)

(Ha ha ha ha)
(It's raining black gold from heaven)

You're the black gold, you're the gasoline
You're the car at the launching, the fire in between
You're the stench of napalm, the drugs that keep us calm
You're the (ha ha ha ha) the hammer of the gods

You're the black gold, you're the black gold c'mon
(It's raining black gold from heaven)
