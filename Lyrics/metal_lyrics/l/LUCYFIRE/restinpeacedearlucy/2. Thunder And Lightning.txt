Your blood is cold as ice in the summer
And you're steaming hot in the winter
Live your life and die for next ----
And you are so much like me

You hide away
From the light
And that's how it begins.

Forget the sunshine for a while
And dance with me into the night

Celebrate the thunder and lightning
Raise your glasses high to the thunder and lightning
Thank god for the thunder and lightning
Celebrate tonight

And our smoke is going down
And snow is falling outside
Through laser stroboscopes
And I see your face in there

You hide away from the light
And that's how it begins
Forget the sunshine for a while
And dance with me into the night

Celebrate the thunder and lightning
Raise your glasses high to the thunder and lightning
Thank god for the thunder and lightning
Celebrate tonight

Through rain and stormy weather
With black boots of leather
You're the flame, you're the fire
Fully equipped with dark desires

Hide away from the light
Now that's how it begins
Forget the sunshine for a while
And dance with me into the night

Celebrate the thunder and lightning
Raise your glasses high to the thunder and lightning
Thank god for the thunder and lightning
Celebrate tonight

The rain the dust the dirt the dark
and the thunder and lightning
To the south and the north and the east and the west
for the thunder and lightning

Thank god for the flood
and the daughters in the blood
and for the thunder and lightning

Celebrate tonight
