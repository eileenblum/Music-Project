Don't wanna hear you talk at all
Just wanna see your dress fall
When the sun settles for a Tokyo day
Give me one night and we'll rock it away

It's just you and me
Baby come on
Come on baby and set me free
Oh yeah, baby come on

Don't wanna wait any second longer
This bitter taste is gonna make me feel stronger
I'm a roaring V8 in a rusty Chevelle
Give me one night and we'll rock it to hell

It's just you and me
Baby come on
Come on baby and set me free
Oh yeah, baby come on

She's a devil of a woman
She's a devil of a woman
She's a devil of a woman
And that's what I like with her
