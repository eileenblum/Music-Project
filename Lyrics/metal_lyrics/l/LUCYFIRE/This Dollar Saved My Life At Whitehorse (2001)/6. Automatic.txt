I'm the nail in the coffin, I'm your cyanide
I'm a million CC on a devil ride
Baby I am red lava on your burning skin
I am out in the cold and I wanna get in
I'm a tiptoeing sin and a knife in your back
I am payback time, I am counter attack
I'm the bee for the honey and a run for the money
Sugar for the sweet and a carrot for the bunny

I'm automatic, oh so static
As a wind, as a river, as a tempest nothing that you can do
I'm automatic, oh so static
As a sin, as a shiver, as a serpent I'll be coming for you

I am big game baby as fat as lard
I'm a crucifix burning in your backyard
I'm a heartshaped pool drooling blood in your face
A Double-Eagle downliner crimson maze
A decapitated horsehead in a virgin bed
I'm the dead of the living and the living of dead
I'm on the right side of the table finishing my last meal
I'm day one in the age of the southern seal

I'm automatic, oh so static
As a wind, as a river, as a tempest nothing that you can do
I'm automatic, oh so static
As a sin, as a shiver, as a serpent I'll be coming for you
