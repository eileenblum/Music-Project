You can have all the sorrow
And all the pain
You can have sunshine honey
Thunder, lightning and rain
You can have second sight
And see how I feel
You can have everything you can touch
And everything unreal

You can have all my love tonite
You can have all my love tonite
The heavens always fall
The night is always young

You can unlock all doors
You can have all the keys
You can ride stormy weather
And a silent breeze
And you can be my baby
Be the one I adore
You can have all of me
And you can have more

You can have all my love tonite
You can have all my love tonite
The heavens always fall
The night is always young
