Six billion ugly heads in the sand
Six billion reasons for not obeying command
Sixhundredsixtysix feet under cheerio
Six billions but no one more like you

Thousand million dollars in the fire
Thousand million dollars take me higher

Sixhundred stallions on their way
Sixhundred's the price I have to pay
For sixhundred hours worth of fun
With six billion idiots in the sun

Thousand million dollars in the fire
Thousand million dollars take me higher

We'll get away with it
Yeah, let's get away with it
