It feels like masturbation
It feels like a rubber maid
When everything I need is first aid

It fees like walking a straight line
With a cloven hoof
When you're on liquid hundred proof

Who will be my Annabel Lee
Be my Annabel Lee
Be the one loved by me

It feels like a good old friend
Like plastic surgery
In this stinking surrogate country

It tastes like powder milk
You're biting your own tail
However damn hard you try you fail

Who will be my Annabel Lee
Be my Annabel Lee
Be the one loved by me
