Cannot stand this shade before me
But I'm alright if you just adore me
Gonna be the emetic of you all
Until the day this fucking curtain fall
There's a crystal supernova
I am God and you're Jehova
Icecold blooded words of doom
Written with a lipstick in the ladies room

Sex, fire &amp; twist &amp; shout &amp; over &amp; out
Sex &amp; fire &amp; twist &amp; shout &amp; over &amp; out

Are we gonna do the things that are undone
Burning like a shotgun in the fast lane, baby come on
Hide one little secret more
Do it like we did before
Got a dirty soul and it's for sale
Trade it for a bottle of the finest pale
Fire at will, baby start the race
If I loose you can punch my ugly face

Sex, fire &amp; twist &amp; shout &amp; over &amp; out
Sex &amp; fire &amp; twist &amp; shout &amp; over &amp; out

I want sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
Give it to me baby 'til I loose control
I know, you know, we know I will pay this toll
For another broken dream and a lovedoll
I've got bloodstains on my fingertips
And a bitter sweet taste on my lips
Wanna have you in the backseat for an hour or two
Take a crashcourse and revel in you
