It's getting dark and cold and the snow is coming down
The lights are fading in my hometown
Let's have another drink to keep us out of the cold
And everything we touch shall turn to gold

Cause baby I just wanna spend my time with you
Yeah, baby I just wanna spend my time with you

In a 747 and the perfect crime
Gonna leave those shores for the very last time
With bags full of money we are never gonna come back again
And there are cracks and hollows in the Cayman sunshine
Hurry up honey we're the last in line
They're never gonna find us and we're never gonna come back again

Well met by streetlights in the wrong part of town
Time to take our work back underground
Let's have a cigarette before the show begins
Let's pray the gods forgive us for our sins

Cause baby I just wanna spend my time with you
Yeah, baby I just wanna spend my time with you

In a 747 and the perfect crime
Gonna leave those shores for the very last time
With bags full of money we are never gonna come back again
And there are cracks and hollows in the Cayman sunshine
Hurry up honey we're the last in line
They're never gonna find us and we're never gonna come back again
