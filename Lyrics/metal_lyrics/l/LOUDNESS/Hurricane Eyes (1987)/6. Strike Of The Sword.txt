Somebody saw the birds in flight
Higher higher we learned to fly
Someone discovered space twilight
Brighter brighter up through the sky
Call it bold technology
Some progress oh no

Someone created life
Surprise 'em, switch and clone 'em, walking lies
Somebody went through time last night
Faster faster speed on goodbye
Call it bold technology
Some progress oh no
Meant to save humanity
Come on can't you see?

Strike of the sword
And we're through
Strike of the sword
Just won't do
Strike of the sword
Still a conflict could just be the last
Yes, it could just be the last

Watch it lead mass destruction

Call it bold technology
Some progress oh no
Meant to save humanity
Come on can't you see?

Strike of the sword
And we're through
Strike of the sword
Just won't do
Strike of the sword
Still a conflict could just be the last
Yes, it could just be the last
