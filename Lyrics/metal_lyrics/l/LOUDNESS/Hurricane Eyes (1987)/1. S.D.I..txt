Hell.....
Hear the thunder crashing through the night
Storm clouds brewing in the East
Out in the East, see the fire blazing out of sight
Tempest raging from the Beast
Where can we go?
In the spirit of survival
Undercover in the danger zone
All the nations will be glowing
On their way to hell

Death and danger on the horizon
Terror all across the land
Feel the power, weapons of destruction
Soldiers take the final stand
Who's in command
Can you feel the wind is blowing
Falling angels on the high frontier
Reaching out in desperation

On their way to push the button down
S.D.I.
They're going all the way
S.D.I.
Such a foolish game
S.D.I.
There's no one left to blame
S.D.I.

Angels of death are marching closer
The last supper's held
Here in the land you'll see no more
I'll see you in hell
They call it war
They call it war
S.D.I., S.D.I., S.D.I.
Hear the thunder crashing through the night
See the fire blazing out of sight
S.D.I., S.D.I., S.D.I.
S.D.I.
