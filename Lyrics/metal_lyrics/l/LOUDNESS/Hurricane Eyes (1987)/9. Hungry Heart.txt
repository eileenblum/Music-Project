Wild fire, he's a runaway
Looking to be free, got to breakaway
Passion when his bullet finds the mark
Like a wolf he's on the prowl with a hungry heart
He's a hungry hunter
Hungry, hungry hunter, hungry

Pleasure when he takes you by the hand
In a bed of fire makes you understand
Understand the danger he trapped you with his will
Take you in his arms, he shoots to kill
Cold hungry hunter

Hungry, got nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
Chained to his soul
Chained to his lies
Plays with a passion he fights to the death
Stealing your heart and your last dying breath
Danger through his fire and ice
The chance you take better think twice
Danger with a vengeance he plays
His thirst for love, you're the game he plays
