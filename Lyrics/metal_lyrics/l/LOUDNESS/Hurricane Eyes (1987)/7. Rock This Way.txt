We're going to rock you
Hey girl, it's over now
Blame it on the world, or take it from me
Nobody's gonna hurt ya
There's no turning back
And hey girl, that's the way it should be
Highway in the sky
Shaking at the wheel
Leaving your troubles behind
Got nowhere to go, but you're going all the way
One of these days, you're gonna find it out

Hey girl, you're much too young
Your daddy says, better slow it all down
But hey girl, you got nothing to hide
Ain't no satisfaction when you're standing on the side
Highway in the sky
Shaking at the wheel
Leaving your troubles behind
Got nowhere to go, but you're going all the way
One of these days, you're gonna find it out

Rock this way
Nobody's going to hurt you
Rock this way
You can take it from me
Rock this way
Someday I'm going to find out
Rock this way
That's the way it should be

Someday I know you will find it
And when you do, you'll know it
You got the heart to make it, baby, baby
