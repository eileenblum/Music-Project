I hear the sound of a heartache
I hear the cries of a lonely heart
I got to know where I'm going
I feel the light of this love grow dark
Blinded by faith
Still I keep waiting for you, for you
Run with the night, love, running blind
I'm losing you

I feel the flames of your fire
I feel the touch of your racy eyes
I know I'm cursed, with a fever
I feel the wind of your hurricane lies
Blinded by faith
Still I keep waiting for you, for you
Run with the night, love, running blind
I'm losing you

This lonely heart
This lonely night, is turning my world into
This lonely heart can't see the light
To find my way back to you
This lonely heart
This lonely night
Baby I'm losing you
