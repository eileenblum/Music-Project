I feel the touch of a midnight lover
I need the heat of a summer night
Makes me feel alright
I feel the pulse of the city lights
Wanna catch the tail of a shooting star
Getting out too far
I can't hold back the feeling
Can't let my dreams come tumbling down

I live for the sounds on the radio
Oh, you know

My tongue is dry, gimme one more Jack
Set 'em up, gonna throw that whiskey down
I am spinning round round round
The music lights my soul on fire
Want it all, wanna take this town alive
Gonna make it mine
Don't tell me I can't make it
I got a dream and it just aren't gonna die
Give me the chance to blow you away
What I say, yeah

I make you feel good
Like a rock 'n' roll gypsy
I make you feel good
Like a rock 'n' roll gypsy
I make you feel good
Like a rock, let me roll
I am a gypsy, let me go

Show me where to run
Show me where to go
Baby I don't know
Show me where to run
Oh yeah
Show me where to go
I love it when you talk to me
