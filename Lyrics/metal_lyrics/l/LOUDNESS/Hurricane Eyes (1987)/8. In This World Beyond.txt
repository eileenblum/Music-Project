This barren town of Kiev
Not a soul in sight
Only complete destruction
Cry of the slow dusty wind
I hear the gods premonition
It plays in my mind
Leave well enough alone over and over again
In this world beyond
Lost forever
In this world beyond
We remember
Oh, never, never again

Your nuclear reactors
Exploding into the sky
No harmony with nature
Destined to die if we don't try
All warrings were ignored
Indirectly we killed
And created wasted lands next door to hell
In this world beyond
Lost forever
In this world beyond
We remember
Oh, never, never

Our lust it knows no limit
We've ignited this bomb
Everything will turn to ashes
All our chances are gone
Better change the plans together
Or live in this world beyond
