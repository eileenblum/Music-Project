Brainwashed metal heads Welcome to madness
Come on now Bang your head and put it to the test
We're goin' crazy now 
Everything is red
Playin' loud We can rock you
Long before you're dead

No preacher, No teacher, All we'll have is fun
The amplifiers explode 
but we can't turn it down
No limit!
Never end it, Breaking all the rules
We'll rock louder with more power 
This is metal mad!

Forever
Carry on
Turning up the sound and let it roll
Raise your fist up in the sky
Our spirit of metal will never die!

Forever 
Carry on
Turning up the sound and let it roll
Raise our fist up in the sky
Our spirit of metal will
never, ever...

Forever 
Carry on
Metal mad is always paradise
So raise your fist up in the sky
Our spirit of metal will
never ,ever, never, ever die!

No way!
It's never gonna die...!
