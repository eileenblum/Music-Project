In the dark you're lost in grief
I take your hand so you won't fade away
I shall become the sun to shine your way

All alone you roam in the sand
Leaving no footstep Leaving no trace
I shall become the rain to heal the pain

Can't you hear I'm calling your name
Can't you see that you are my flame
Right by your side I always will be
Until the day .....your day will come

When you're cursed and under the spell
I'll be the one to set you free
Let me be a sacrifice for you

Can't you hear I'm calling your name
Can't you see that you are my flame
Right by your side I always will be
Until the day .....your day will come

THE END WILL NEVER COME...

Can you hear my prayer for you?
Until the end of time
And I cry my heart out for you
I'd kill myself for you
