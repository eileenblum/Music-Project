Oh! Oh! Oh!
I can't turn away from my desire
I gotta keep on, I want more
I feel so low, and I need to know
How to catch the rainbow
I gotta feel the glow
The hot halo
It's Heaven's imitation
I gotta feeling the night
Will burn so bright
Joyous damnation

Lost in the heat of your embrace
I'm in you deep and I'm pushing
Keep coming again, no end
To the burning
Feel the heat of my touch
My eyes, my soul
As we lose control
Caught in the grip
Shoot from the hip
Can't stop the flow!

Woow Oh.. HELL FIRE LOVE
Oh feel the flame
Pleasure and pain
Woow Oh.. HELLFIRE...YEAH

HELLFIRE!
Ogre fuck Ogre fuck
God is in you
Angel fuck angel fuck
The Devil's in you
God is in you
God is in you
Holy fuck holy fuck
A Holy fuck you

The beauty of the sin
The fire burns within
Free your pearly gates
Lost in love and hate
Can't control the flame
Making us insane
Making us insane
