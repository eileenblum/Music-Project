Cast aspersion
Curse and swear
Writings on the wall
The time has come to
Break the spell
Now it's time to roll

I'm a rebel standing tall
All together, One for all

Drowning in the wishing well
My mind's about to blow
We take our chances
We take our pills
Yet pain is all we know
Straight out of our soul

Raise your hands up high
You are not alone
Call me rebel
What are you waiting for?
Now the time has come
You are not the only one
Come together
All for one
Straight out of our soul

Cast aspersion
Curse and swear
Writings on the wall
The time has come to
Break the spell
Now it's time to roll

Raise your hands up high
You are not alone
Call me rebel
What are you waiting for?
Now the time has come
You are not the only one
Come together
All for one
Straight out of our soul
