All around the world I've seen all right and wrong
Nothing is shocking Knew it all along
But cannot stand losing the place I belong
Show no mercy Betrayer

Hypnotized
Mesmerized
Awake to lies
Open your eyes

Voice of anger Hey can't you hear?
Mass hysteria State under fear
Vain euphoria Soon disappear
Reign of terror No hope right here

Hypnotized
Mesmerized
Awake to lies
Open your eyes

Dragged into hell
Dragged into hell
Dragged into hell

Dragged into hell
You're taking my soul
Casting your spell
To conquer the world

Dragged into hell
You're ruling the world
Dragged into hell
Outta control
Ah Ah Ah
Dragged into hell

You're taking my soul
Casting your spell
To conquer the world
Dragged into hell
You're taking my soul
Casting your spell
To conquer the world
You're ruling the world!
