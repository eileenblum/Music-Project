On the planet where we stand
The battle rages on
Fades into Hell
Burning sensations command
Leaving us the drink of anger
The world is filled with hate
Consciousness never deceives
Hate against the death

Death Machine
Killing fields Genocide
Death Machine
Beyond our control...
Giving you the pain you made
Agony the price to be paid
We're living in an isolation
Leaving us with frustration
Gonna be the hell that you wished for
Another war to end war
Fades into Hell
Burning sensations command

Death Machine
Killing fields Genocide
Death Machine
Beyond our control...
Death Machine!...
Death Machine
Killing fields Genocide
Death Machine
Beyond our control...

Burn in hell!
Burn in hell!
Burn in hell!
Burn in hell!
Burn in hell!...
Death Machine...
