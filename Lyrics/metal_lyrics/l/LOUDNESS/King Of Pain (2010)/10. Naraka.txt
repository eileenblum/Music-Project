You know you fall into dark abyss of desperation
The devil you know and fear The hell to death you scare
But all the things that you see It's not really there
There's no heaven or hell It's only the creature of you mind

Light and Shade
Deep in the valley of hell
Evil and a saint
You'll find yourself in heaven

Die to live
Misery makes you strong
Live to Die
The pain is for pleasure

Light and Shade
Evil and a saint
Die to live
Live to Die

It's all about perception You're bound in chains for life
The hell becomes your hell when you think it's there
You've gotta open your mind and liberate from fear
Surrender to the great power of mystery

You know you fall into dark abyss of desperation
The devil you know and fear The hell to death you scare
But all the things that you see It's not really there
There's no heaven or hell It's only the creature of you mind
