Silent death spiral I'm caught
Feeds on itself 'til it rots
Blacked out You're gonna eat me alive
I'm begging for life but the god betrayed

Deep down Inside I want to scream
Darkness drags me into abyss
Nightmare comes true It's not a dream
State of chaos!
pull me out!

Don't you kill me
Save me! Save me!
Don't you kill me!
Save me! Save me!

Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!

Seeking for the light of truth
But only darkness I could see
Devours the shadow Devours the light
Is this hell that I deserve?

Deep down Inside I want to scream
Darkness drags me into abyss
A Nightmare comes true It's not a dream
State of chaos
pull me out

Don't you kill me!
Save me! Save me!
Don't you kill me!
Save me! Save me!

Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!

Drown in my pain
Within myself
There's no mercy
Doodlebug

Don't you kill me!
Save me! Save me!
Don't you kill me!
Save me! Save me!

Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
Doodlebug!
