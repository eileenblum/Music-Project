He will avenge
He hears his call
Healing the sickness infecting us all

Demon of faith
Perilless race
He kills the pain the devil will fall

Creature of night
Angel of life

When will it die
When will it drain
All of this pain it makes me insane
Buried alive
Hides in my brain
When will it die
Invisible pain

Creature of night
Angel of life

Doctor from Hell! From Heaven I fell!
Rescue me from the darkness
Living in Hell! Created myself
Caged in the cell I made.

Doctor from Hell! From Heaven I fell!
Souls lost in the darkness
Show me the way, light of the day
Where is the key to this cage?

Doctor from Hell!

He will avenge
He hears his call
Healing the sickness infecting us all

Demon of faith
Perilless race
He kills the pain the devil will fall

Creature of night
Angel of life

Doctor from Hell! From Heaven I fell!
Rescue me from the darkness
Living in Hell! Created myself
Caged in the cell I made.

Doctor from Hell! From Heaven I fell!
Souls lost in the darkness
Show me the way, light of the day
Where is the key to this cage?

Doctor from Hell!
Lost in Hell!
