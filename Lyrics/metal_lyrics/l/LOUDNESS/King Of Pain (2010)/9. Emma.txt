Black! I'm staring blank into space Death crawls up to me
Dark! No matter how I tried Couldn't feel Realized I'm gone

Dark is breaking the dawn I'm closer
The lord of death is near
He pulls out my soul from my corpse
Final judgement Trial is done

Great ruler! Save me from hell fire
Evil! I'm bound to the sin now
Won't you grant me your great mercy!

Eternal! Bow to the lord of death
Burn me the endless hell
Burn me to ashes and crush my soul
Forever I'm bound by spell
Oh yeah! Hey! Oh yeah! Hey!
Burn me to dust and crush my soul
The lord of hell he reigns

Rise! Screams of fright echoes, the punishment is done
Life! The guardians of hell brings the dead one by one
I'm a slave of bad karma, my burden a disaster
I swallow the blood to please the lord of the underworld

Eternal! Bow to the lord of death
Burn me the endless hell
Burn me to ashes and crush my soul
Forever I'm bound by spell
Oh yeah! Hey! Oh yeah! Hey!
Burn me to dust and crush my soul
The lord of hell he reigns

"I could've avoided him. I could've let it go. I always had before,
but that day I didn't for some reason, that day I didn't think about
the pain my body and pride might suffer.
Time passed and the dread slowly released me..."

Burn me to dust and crush my soul
The lord of hell he reigns
Burn me to ashes crush my soul
The lord of hell he reigns

Burn me Burn me Burn me to dust and crush my soul

Eternal! Bow to the lord of death
Burn me the endless hell
Burn me to ashes and crush my soul
Forever I'm bound by spell
Oh yeah! Hey! Oh yeah! Hey!
Burn me to dust and crush my soul
The lord of hell he reigns
Eternal! Bow to the lord of death
Burn me the endless hell
Burn me to ashes and crush my soul
Forever I'm bound by spell
