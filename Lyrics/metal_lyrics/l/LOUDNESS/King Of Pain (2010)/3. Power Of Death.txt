You can feel it rising wherever you go
All hell's breaking loose I let my anger grow
Injection to the veins My blood's running wild
Roam through the darkness like a satan's child

Metal power! Thrashing rage!
We got the power to satisfy
Metal power! Thrashing death!
Nothing can stop us now!
Can nothing hold us back!

The Phoenix rising from ashes to the sky
Down to hell and back we defy
Crushing the chains that bind soul and mind
Born again for we shall never die

Metal power! Thrashing death!
We got the power to satisfy
Metal power! Thrashing death!
Nothing can stop us now!
Can nothing hold us back!

We got the power of death!
We are back! Reborn to rock!
We got the power of death!
We are the one! We're second to none!

[Guitar Solo]

We got the power to tear down the wall
Raising your fist for the rage in your soul
Break down the boundaries
We're out of control
The bright golden future
We're ready to roll

We got power of death!
We are back! Reborn to rock!
We got power of death!
We are the one
We're second to none

Power of death! We are back!
Power of death! And we survived!
Power of death! We are back!
Power of death! Reborn to rock!
Power of death! We are back!
Power of death! And we survived!
