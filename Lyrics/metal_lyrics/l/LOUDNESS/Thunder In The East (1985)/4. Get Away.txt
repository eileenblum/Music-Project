Get away, I'm warning you
Get away, I'm telling you
Watch what you say
On the danger way
Get away, let's shake it
Get away, let's break it
Ain't safe to play
On the danger way
Without concrete, you'd be lost
Without hot wheels, you'd be lost
Without chain link, you'd be lost
Without cold steel, you'd be lost
* Don't look back, run for cover
Save yourself, save your lover
Overkill, undercover
Hit and run at midnight
Get away, stop losing
Get away, I'm cruising
Every day
On the danger way
Get away, go faster
Get away, disaster
Ricochet
On the danger way
Without shadows, you could die
Without leather, you could die
Without fighting, you could die
Without switchblades, you could die
[* Repeat]
Without concrete, you'd be lost
Without cold steel, you'd be lost
Without fighting, you could die
Without switchblades, you could die
[* Repeat]
