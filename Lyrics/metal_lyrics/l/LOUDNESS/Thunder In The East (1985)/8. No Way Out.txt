Lost in the underground
Lookin' for daylight
Afraid darkness
And surrounded by the light
Screaming I shout
There's no way out
You said goodby so cold
I stood in wonder
Shocked by the silence
Shaken by the thunder
Screaming I shout
There's no way out
* I ask questions and you tell me lies
Try to make you but I'm hypnotized
Am I over you? I got my doubts
I try everything, there's no way out
I walk the streets at night
I hear your laughter
The voices in my head
They don't mind, I don't matter
Screaming I shout
There's no way out
Watching the hours crack
Still have that feelin'
Darkness attacks the wall
I hit the ceiling
Screaming I shout
There's no way out
[* Repeat]
** You got your vain excuses
I got my anger
One fight, guess who loses
That's what tortures me
[*, ** Repeat]
There's no way out!
