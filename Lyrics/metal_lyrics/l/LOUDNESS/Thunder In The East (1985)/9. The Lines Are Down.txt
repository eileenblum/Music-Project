You cry, darkness listens
You hide, sudden sorrow
Black and blue
When fever builds inside you
Your body shivers hot and cold at night
Hold on tight
You know the power's out
You can't leave
Now that your heart is pounding, energy
Shattered, afraid to show it
Don't let the crazy madness pull you in
Fight to win
Looks like your life is crashing
You're on the razor's edge
It's hard to know
Don't let go
The night is blowing cold
You can't leave
Twisted by silence and the agony
* Lines are down everywhere
Something's under the stair
Lines are down
The razor's edge
Cry for me
You cry darkness listens
You hide, sudden sorrow fights at you
Break on through
Lights out, someone's watching
Lookin' for the images to cut and run
Load your gun
One shot, squeeze the trigger
Make them leave
Left in the night, the only enemy
[* Repeat]
