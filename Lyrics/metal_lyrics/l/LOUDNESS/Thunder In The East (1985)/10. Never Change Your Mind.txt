Got a new hair style I see
And you're dressed to kill
Bright coloured lipstick for me
But against my will
Please don't go changin'
You're gonna change your mind
Please never change your mind
I look at you, head to toe
But it don't seem right
All this fashion for show
Happened overnight
I've got your number
It's only changin' times
Please never change your mind
* Hear me when I'm sayin'
How my love grows
Given time and a chance, you'll see
Things are always cahngin'
That's how love goes
Don't go changin' a thing for me
[* Repeat]
