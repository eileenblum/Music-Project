* I got your real love, baby
I got everything on my side
I got your real love, baby
I wanna keep you satisfied
** Can't you see I'm so true
I'm crazy for you
So spend your life with me
That's all you can do
* We could be together
We could be together
I want your real love, baby
I'll get you everything that you need
I want your real love, baby
I'll try to keep you satisfied
[** Repeat]
[* Repeat]
I don't wanna hurt you
You don't need the pain
Don't you know that I need to
Love you again
