Sometimes I scream, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I just lie in illusion
Some nights I shake, some nights I sweat
Some nights I'm just wet with confusion
* Don't do this, don't do that
Don't look back, you might stumble
Don't say yes, don't say no
Don't let go, or your tumble down
Some days I kick, some days I bite
Some days I must fight the reaction
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose
Sometimes I'm just bruised by the action
** Now you have the power to destroy
Clockwork people just like clockwork toy
Don't try to tell me your fantasy
It's my life
You try to tell me what's right for me
Turn the knife, twist the key
[* Repeat]
[** Repeat]
Now we have the power to destroy
Clockwork people just like clockwork toy
