Taken in the frozen dawn
No way out still holding on
Empty hands, full of pain
Reaching for the rain
Let me go now
No where to run
Under the gun
* Run for your life
Run from the fire
Want to survive
Run for your life
Nothing but the night exists
Dark the cold wet mist
Trapped in time with no way out
Can't you hear me shout
Let me go now
Open the cell
I can't take this hell
[* Repeat]
[Solo]
[* Repeat]
Want to survive
run for your life
