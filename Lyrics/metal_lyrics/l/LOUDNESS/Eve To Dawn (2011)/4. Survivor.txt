On the verge of desperation
My hope's all blown away
Wailing inside and it hurts so
Haunted by recurring nightmare
Now I know it's real
My soul's screaming âI've got to surviveâ

Losing myself to a life of confusion and pain
It's easy to give up the future but had to retain
Stand to survive

Oh....Get over fears(Got to survive!)
Oh....Follow your heart
There's no wrong and right
Just darkness and light
You've got to carry on
Oh.....Flame's burning higher

Losing myself to a life of confusion and pain
It's easy to give up the future but had to retain

Life is a quest for finding who you are
Stepping into the unknown to embrace your dream
Breaking away from the status quo
I know the price to pay
I'd sacrifice all that I have to survive

Stand to survive! Stand to survive!

Chasing the sun
There's no turning back
Come the dawn again
A rainbow I'll never let go
I'll survive

Stand to survive! Stand to survive!
