Woo yeah!!
He played a fool
Getting serious with you
A self-conceited fool

Your finger-playin' melts my bone
I'll hold you at once and you'll be mine
A stage played by self-conceited fool

Won't take a breath, I'm dreamin'
The petals are already wet

Your mysterious love took my breath away
Don't Don't Don't leave me

Ah ah ah ah
Don't leave me
Don't go
No No
