Secluded town, tonight once more
Hard Workin'
Drag that worn body
Hard Workin'
Woo yeah!!

A Bright ray of light shines
Through the world of sleep
In search of never-ending happiness
Lost in time  Hold out!!

Under the pounding rain  Hard Workin'
Flows without end  Hard Workin'!!

Hold out
Hold out
[repeat]
