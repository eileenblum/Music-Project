Fed up with all the pretending
Not to see your changes
No more act of cool and mature
Time after time
I dream in peaceful seclusion
Like a child

Ah - joyfully playing  ooh yeah!!
Ah - smiles that brings cheer
Are you ready to rock Can't you see it
Keep on Rockin'
Get up and Rockin' the nation

Wavering illusion
Won't stop telling love nor stop these tears
Time after time
I dream in peaceful seclusion
Like a child
