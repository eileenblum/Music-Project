I'm a junky - Crazed
A Fighting man wannabe
I'm a junky - Extreme
A lonely Gambling man

I'm a sleep walker - Always
Blown by the wind  Rolling stone
I'm a sleep walker - No exception
A sinful playboy  Freezing stone

Oh my loving maid

You are my miserable loving maid
Don't cry  stop the rain
You are my sad loving maid
Don't cry stop the rain

I'm a dreamer my loving maid
Hope you understand my Blazing heart
I'm a dreamer this is the end
Just a short goodbye  Blowing town

Oh my loving maid
