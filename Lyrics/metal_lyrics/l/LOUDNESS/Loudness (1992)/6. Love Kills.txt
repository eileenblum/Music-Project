It's the wind that brings her to me
Catch the scent and send it to me
I taste the flavour on my tongue
And I run to the edge
But I'm afraid, too scared to look down
These blues are swimming all around me
And I, I can't live without you now

Love kills
Leaves you bleeding
Love kills
Nothing left for me
Love kills
True believing
And I'm dying to believe

But like an animal I shiver
Dreaming all the dreams of summer
When I was burning in her bed
We ran wild in the rain
Crazy from the heat
Crazy to surrender
And I, I can't live without you now

Love kills
Leaves you bleeding
Love kills
Nothing left for me
Love kills
True believing
And I'm dying to be free

And then you take my heart
You're gonna break my heart
Crying in the rain

Love kills
Leaves you bleeding
Love kills
Nothing left for me
Love kills
True believing
And I still want to believe
Love kills
Love kills
And I'm dying to be free
