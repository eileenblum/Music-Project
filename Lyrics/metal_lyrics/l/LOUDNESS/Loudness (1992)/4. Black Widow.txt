She'll eat your soul
Kill your sweet dreams
Heart and bones
She'll pick them clean
She's a death machine
Got pretty poison
To nail you in
Her web of sin

She's made of shade
And I'm going down

Take me to the heart of the night
Black Widow
Black Widow
Come on and eat my soul
Black Black Widow

Insect eyes
Bright with malice
Shiny black
Chrysalis
From the abyss
She's calling dark things
To lay tonight
Beneath her wings

She's back in black
And I'm going down

Take me to the heart of the night
Black Widow
Black Black Widow
Come on and eat my soul
Come on and eat my soul

The shapes of fear
Drawing near
I can hear
The poison whispers
Taste of pain
Always remains
Scars of shame
Can't resist her
Can't resist her

She'll wither your soul
Infect your dreams
Swallow you whole
She's a death machine

Come on, lick it
And stick it
Let's write in blood

Take me where the shadows are bright
Black Widow
Come on, eat my soul
Take me to the heart of the night
Black Widow
Black Black Widow
Come on and eat my soul
Come on
