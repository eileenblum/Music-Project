Going for the jugular
Bleeding in the rain
Straight down the road to nowhere
Burning up the fast lane
Red eyed, smoke and sweat
Pump chrome and steel
If I end up as burger, babe
Well, you can have a meal

Riding free
Into the wind
Never wanna die
I love the life I live
Wild and free
Ride to win
Ain't no sin
Racing the wind
Burning, burning

Redline through this ghost town
Got to keep on riding
Take it day by day
Couldn't see the future
Ain't got no past
I ain't got sweet Jesus
But I don't kiss no ass

Riding free
Into the wind
Never wanna die
I love the life I live
Wild and free
Ride to win
Ain't no sin
Racing the wind
Burning, burning
Racing the wind
Burning

Going for the jugular
Speeding through the rain
Straight down the road to nowhere
Fever pitching in my veins
Couldn't see the future
Ain't got no past
I ain't got sweet Jesus
But I don't kiss no ass

Riding free
Into the wind
Never wanna die
I love the life I live
Wild and free
Ride to win
Ain't no sin
Racing the wind
Burning, turning
Racing the wind
Racing the wind
