Filthy basement, locked inside a cage
Screaming patient, animal in a rage
Eyes looking out of holes in hell
Eyes that shout
Blameless victim

In the Slaughter House
Dying to get out
Of the Slaughter House

Shut up! Shut up! Some shit colored blue
Torture tested, product safe for you
Now you see it, writhing on the wall
Now you don't
Nameless victim

In the Slaughter House
Only one way out
Of the Slaughter House

Kill to live
We killed to live
One way out
One way out

Slaughter House
Check into death motel
Slaughter House
Welcome to Hell
Welcome to Hell

Weeping, speaking, lips adored with flies
Snot is leaking, reeking from its eyes
Dog sleeping on a bed of lice
Wired head
Somebody's got to pay the price

In the Slaughter House
Dying to get out
Of the Slaughter House

Kill to live
We killed to live
One way out
One way out

Slaughter House
Slaughter House
