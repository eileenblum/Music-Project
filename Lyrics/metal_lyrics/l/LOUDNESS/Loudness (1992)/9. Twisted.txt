I'm twisted, bent to the bone
Hey sister, can I take you home?
I wanna shake you up
Take you to the moon
Swim the crater
To your leather lagoon

Slam dunk, I'm the punk
Your mother's scared of
Come on, bite a chunk
Of my lunatic love

Don't you know that I'm
Twisted
Look out, look out, I'm out to get you
Twisted
They let me out and I'm gonna get you

Rabid sicko deviant dude
I'm a psycho, got a bad attitude
I put the "S" in "M"
The rock in the roll
Gimme the pink, babe
Got to get control

Good time Frankenstein
You know what I like
Strip gears, come over here
And lay down on my bike

Can't you see that I'm
Twisted
Look out, look out, I'm out to get you
Twisted
They let me out and I'm gonna get you
I'll get you

Rocks in my head 'n' a straight jacket
Give me an axe so I can whack it
Twisted
Rocks in my head 'n' a straight jacket
Give me an axe so I can whack it
Twisted

So light the dynamite
And blow up my brain
Shell shock rock the block
And let's go insane, yeah

Don' t you know that I'm
Twisted
Look out, look out, I'm out to get you
Twisted
They let me out and I'm gonna get you
Look out, look out, look out
Twisted
Twisted
Come on
Twisted
Twisted
Twisted
Twisted
Come on
Twisted
