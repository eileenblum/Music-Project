A pack of lies
A sack of jive
To keep it all in line
You know that everyone lies

The flim and flam
The skim and the scam
They double speak
Then take a leak in your eyes

Dogs of deception
Reality bends
Stretching perception
It never ends
It never ends

They went to bed
She gave him head
But every word he said
It was just a big lie

She said it's this
He knows it's that
Right then he smells a rat
He knows that everyone lies

Dogs of deception
The worst of the breed
Stretching perception
Monstrous deeds
Powered by greed

Everyone lies
Better get wise
Everyone lies

Who can I trust?
Who can I trust??
Who can I trust???
Tell me baby
Tell me now
Who can I trust?
Who can I trust??
Who can I trust???
Tell me baby
Tell me now
I can't take it anymore

Everyone lies
Better get wise
Everyone lies
Everyone lies
So sick of bullshit
Better get wise
Everyone lies
You got me crazy
