Battle rages on and on
Satisfy their appetite
Demon greed justified
Are we sacrificed for prosperity
No lessons learned
Time will tell the truth
Exploitation leads to devastation
Fight goes on Evil-driven force
The power source
Battle rages on
Over the driving force
On and on
Kill, deceive and destroy
The weaker goes to the wall
Obey the law of the jungle
Noble and grand your dream
Only the brutal survive
Only the loud will outlast
Are we left behind
A grim future is now
