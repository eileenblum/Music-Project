Say you want more, you greedy swine
The savage ruler
âCause you cannot forget the taste of wine
The power abuser
Monopoly, money hungry
Bloodsucker
Starving soldiers, Falling empire under fire
Bang âem dead! Bang âem dead Right now!
Bang âem dead! Bang âem dead Right now!
Expose the lies and deception
Money cannot buy you salvation
Your days are numbered
Nowhere to hide
Truth be told now
No more lies
Think you run the game Megalomania
Weâre falling victim to the mass hysteria
Money-spittinâ Powertrippinâ
Know you wonât last long
Black history again and again
Do we ever learn?
