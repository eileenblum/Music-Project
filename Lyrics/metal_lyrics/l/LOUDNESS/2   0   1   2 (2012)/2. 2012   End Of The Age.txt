Domesticated nation
Ignorant subjugation
The crimson Urge for conquest
Creeping reign of terror
Calling all the shots
Baring fangs Peopleâs republic
Bound in chains for the rest of your life
Children brainwashed
Social corruption
Falling deeper into chaos
The human wasteland
It slowly kills the earth
Our ego chokes us to death
The world of free-for-all
Itâs time to pay the due
The storyâs been told
Itâs end of the Age
Are we at the end of game?
Thereâs no future?
Open up your mind now
For all mankind
Come together as one
From eve to dawn
Power politicians
Die in hell
Eternity in inner-selves
Twenty-twelve
The human extinction
Absolute contradiction
