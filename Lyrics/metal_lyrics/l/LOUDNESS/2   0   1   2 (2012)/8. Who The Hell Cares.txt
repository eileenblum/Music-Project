The time has come to say goodbye
But you know I ainât the only one
All the heroes, fools and saints
Theyâre gonna die no matter who they are
Up above, Is there a heaven?
(I donât give a shit! No one will ever know)
Down below, Is there a hell?
(I donât give a shit! No one will ever know)
Annihilation of mankind?
I know thereâs only one thing for sure
Doomsday clock ticking
I can only say that nothing lasts forever
Who the hell cares? Whatâs really hip
(Who the hell! Who the hell cares!)
Who the hell cares? Big money talks
(Who the hell! Who the hell cares!)
Who the hell cares? Whoâs the next liar?
(Who the hell! Who the hell cares!)
Who the hell cares? Rock is dead
(Who the hell! Who the hell cares!)
We are born to live and die
To the heaven we will fly
Thereâs no need for fear or fright
So long
Shout! Shout! Shout now!
When you feel down, darkness comes
Youâll never know tomorrow, God never answers
My tongue is dry gimme some more JACK
Just let it go, let it flow
Carry out a coup dâetat
I know thereâs only one thing for sure
Doomsday clock ticking
I can only say that nothing lasts forever
Shout! Shout! Shout now!
