Life pass you by
You know youâre wasting time
We all shall die and say goodbye
Live your days to the full
You cannot turn the clock back
Just leave behind
Ask no reason why
But keep that in your mind
Let me tell you something
Tomorrowâs another day
And yesterdayâs away
No matter how fast you run
Your life is only once
Grief is everywhere
Filling airwaves everyday
Nothing unusual for all of us
Remember you will be dying
So seize the day
The eternal life not for me
Another sun will rise
Another day will break
In the morning comes
A joy of new life
Live your days to the full
Life in a fast lane
Cruising the slow lane
Itâs not about the speed
But how long you survive
Let me tell you something
