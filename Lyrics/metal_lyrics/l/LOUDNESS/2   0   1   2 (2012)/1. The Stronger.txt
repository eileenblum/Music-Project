Break the chains Stop the pain
Need the power to overcome
Donât you wait now You gotta get moving
Taking action before too late
Take a stand Hold your ground
Show the world what you can do
Donât let yesterday ruin today
Live for the moment âcause future is now
The stronger we be
Stand tall and see
Proudly we scream
The answer lies in our own hands
Come together you know we can change
Weâre gonna do it Do it our way
Even thereâs gonna be hell to pay
We can rise Rise again
Donât let our passion fade away
The more pain we overcome
The stronger we become
Stand tall and see
Proudly we scream
The stronger we be
âEye for an eyeâ
Blind justice
Trust yourself
Trust your chaos
