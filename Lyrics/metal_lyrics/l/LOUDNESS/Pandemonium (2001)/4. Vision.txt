I am drowning in an endless sorrow,
Oh yeah I thought I had a vision of you
I am diving into Sweet Bitter Pain
Oh yeah I though I saw the truth
Behind the scene

Reality and fantasy, lost in its ebb and flow
My emotions running low, love makes another mark

I am dancing that vision
Just cannot run away from it
I'm dancing with an illusion
You just can't fight with it

Oh yeah, endless days of torture and pain
Oh yeah, thoughts of you like binding chains
Oh yeah, in darkness darker than night
Oh yeah, fighting my way down the light

Visions of eternity with the traps you set for me
Oh, when will you set me free from the spells you cast on me?

I am dancing that vision
Just cannot run away from it
I'm dancing with an illusion
You just can't fight with it

I am dancing that vision
Just cannot run away from it
I'm dancing with an illusion
You just can't fight with it

I am dancing that vision
Just cannot run away from it
I'm dancing with illusions
You just can't fight with it
