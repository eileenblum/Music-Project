Flipped on the TV, what's this I see?
Destruction like war, no it's war
Try to close my eyes but it all reappears
Nowhere safe these days, frustration everywhere

They say, I'm the light
They say, I'm your night
They say, I will rule your brain

Unneeded tragedy, endless loops of news
You see the flips side of the peace
Truth you don't wanna, violence called justice
Fire in the air, all hope disappears

They say, I'm the king
They say, I'm you God
They say, I will rule your domain

You think we'll let you succeed
You better thin again, fuck you!

Ya stepped on a mine
Ya stepped on a mine

Tears flowing like rain
Who can wash them away?
Crying from despair
Who will heal this pain?
Time to take things in hand
Time to end this chain
Oh my brothers in arms, strap up for the ride

Fuck you! I'll show you Power
Fuck you! I'll show you Justice
Fuck you! I'll give you Hell
Fuck you! Fuck you!

There will be no place to hide
Time to end the rain of terror

Ya stepped on a mine
Ya stepped on a mine
Ya stepped on a mine
Ya stepped on a mine
