What's the truth? What's the truth?
What's the truth? What's the truth?

Hearsay, idle talk, fallacy
What's up? Media hypocrisy
Control Government heresy!
Who does take 'em to security

Justice, Purity, Equity
Where are people of integrity?
Shut out, under fire, oversee
Liability!

Media machine! What does it all mean?
Who are the liars?
Who's on the team? Who gets to come clean?
Who are the buyers?
Not me!
When are you gonna realize
Not to take what they provide

What's the truth? What's the truth?
What's the truth? What's the truth?

Hiding under their sense of pride
Taking all of us for a ride
Pander to the crowd with the hype
Soundbite, photo op, parasite

What the fuck are we gonna do?
Wake up! Gotta stand, me and you
They are gonna lie and say it's true
Freedom of the press

Media machine! What does it all mean?
Who are the liars?
Who's on the team? Who gets to come clean?
Who are the buyers?
Not me!
When are you gonna realize
Not to take what they provide

They call it true, they call it free
Government hypocrisy
Manipulating policy
They are the real enemy

I'll stand and fight, I'd rather die
Than to take all of our lies
You think you're smart, you think you're wise
And information just dies
