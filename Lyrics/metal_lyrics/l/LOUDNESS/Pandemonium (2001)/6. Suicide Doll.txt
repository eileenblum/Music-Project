Here comes that voice again
A whispering voice from the shadows
Chills go straight down your spine
The words like thorns in your head
The air is still as the night
But candles are flickering wild
Doors open to the void
And someone calls your name

Yeah! Trapped in this cage, crying in vain
Please! Save me from this pain that's driving me insane

Black winged angels swarm above
Yeah! Don't know where to run
Nowhere to hide
Black winged angel swarm like vultures

A deadly smile by souls who welcome you home
I'm feeling like a little rag doll
On this dark night when flowers fall to the ground
I'm just a little suicidal

The sky comes falling down
It's tumbling down to the ground
The gate slams open wide
And demons come rushing in
There is that song again
A haunting song known as freedom
With arms spread open wide
Dark angels call my name

Yeah! Trapped in this cage, crying in vain
Please! Save me from this pain that's driving me insane
Black winged angels swarm above
Yeah! Don't know where to run
Nowhere to hide
Black winged angel swarm like vultures

A deadly smile by souls who welcome you home
I'm feeling like a little rag doll
On this dark night when flowers fall to the ground
I'm just a little suicidal

A welcoming smile by souls who hang from a tree
I'm feeling like a little rag doll
On this bright night when angels fall to the ground
I'm just a little suicidal
Floating away now, as life starts dwindling down
I'm feeling like a little rag doll
On this cold night when dreams come to an end
I'm just a little suicide doll
