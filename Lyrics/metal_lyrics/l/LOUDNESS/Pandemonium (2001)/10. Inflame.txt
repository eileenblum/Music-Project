Locked in this prison cage, you call my name
I turn my head and there you are, the cell falls and breaks away
And now you turn to me and say
Is your heart on fire?

Nightingale of paradise, your song so sweet
The message on your melody, the call for a brand new day
And now you look at me and say
Is your soul aflame?

Inflame my fantasy
Enhance my reality
Kindle the fire in my soul
Give me the energy
To face my own destiny
Give me the strength to keep moving on

You look straight into my eyes
Setting me aflame

Inflame my fantasy
Enhance my reality
Kindle the fire in my soul
Give me the energy
To face my own destiny
Give me the strength and I'll keep moving on

Is your soul on fire? Is your heart on fire?
Is your soul on fire? Is your heart on fire?
