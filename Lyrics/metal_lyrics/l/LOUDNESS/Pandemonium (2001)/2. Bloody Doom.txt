Like lightning, see the twins fall down
It's frightening, bloody dust on the ground
Indicting, race war resounds
Reciting propaganda sounds

Nations cry, politicians ponder deceptions
Citizens boil in anger
But in this international bloodlust
Can anyone see the hand of conspiracy?

Whose hand is on the lever?
Whose life should be severed?

The self-righteous and power hungry
Of the east and the west
The holy Jihad and the Republican warlords
Now they both have an opportunity

Big plans, undercover
Coup detat for big brother

The sacrifice of blood will run and flow
Vengeance and holy war
Just watch it grow
Just watch the show

Emotion, put your brain on hold
Abortion of sense and woes
Devotion to blood and gold
In motion, let's kill our foes

A trigger-happy world police and
A guerrilla religious order
The big terrorist and the small one
Who has caused more death and suffering?

How long will we suffer?
How can we come together?

Manipulate the crowds
Feed them a tune
It shouldn't be allowed
It's our bloody doom
Our bloody doom

Whose hand is on the lever?
Whose life should be severed?
How long will we suffer?
How can we come together?

The sacrifice of blood will run and flow
Vengeance and holy war, we'll watch it grow
Manipulate the crowds, feed them a tune
Please, it can't be allowed
It's our bloody doom
It's our bloody doom
