I was a monkey in a tree
Swinging oh so carelessly
Then I saw you smile
And sink your fangs down my side
Your poison seeps into my streams
My whole body shivers in joy
There is no way in hell
That I'll ever be the same

Show, show me your poisoned fangs tonight
Show, show me your snake venom tonight
Oh, I'll love you anyway

I feel trapped when I'm with you
You sure have a grip on me
Can someone help me please?
There is nothing I can do
You bind my heart from dusk till dawn
Addictive poison in my brain
Oh what can I do
But bow down and beg for more

Show, show me your poisoned fangs tonight
Show, show me your snake venom tonight
Oh, I'll love you anyway

Show me your sweet thing
Show me your sweet love
Show me your everything
I love you anyway

Show me your sweet thing
Show me your sweet love
Show me your everything
I love you anyway

Show me your sweet thing
Show me your sweet love
Show me your everything
I love you anyway
