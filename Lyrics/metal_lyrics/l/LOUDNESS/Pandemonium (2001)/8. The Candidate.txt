What can you do? Who do you know?
How much can you pay
What can you hide? What's up inside?
Who'll be the one you betray

It doesn't matter what you've done
Come in and sit down
We'll tell you what to say
Every word and every breath, every sound

Looking for, looking for, looking for, looking for
A phony, phony, phony, a phony, phony, phony

You know the letter of the law
You can stand tall
Don't worry 'bout the liberals
We can make them take the fall

Oh yes, you'll win and when you're in you'll be chief justice
Do as you're told, just take the gold, exchange your mind for a fist
When you succeed, oh how they'll plead for retribution
Then you'll deny their angry cry, your words will be like a gun

Looking for, looking for, looking for, looking for
A phony, phony, phony, a phony, phony, phony

It doesn't matter what you feel
Your convictions
They don't mean a thing at all
Without them you can have it all

Throw away all your doubts
Trust in us, we are the power
Laws can change, you will change them
The weak will cry, see them cower, feel the power

You know the letter of the law
You can stand tall
Don't worry 'bout the innocent
We can make them take the fall
You won't feel a thing at all
