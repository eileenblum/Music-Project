Oh, in the dark where fear's the rule
Where hell's bells ring aloud
The dark red moon rising high
Bloodshed everywhere

You gotta wake up to hear the call
To feel the power flow through your blood
Time to choose a path to stride
Knowing that there is more than one

You swear to God that you'll be true
To yourself and what you do
Time to swallow all the pain
Kill your pride and let it flow

The story of a thousand dreams
Shown like on the TV screen
The knowledge from a thousand years gone by
Even the atrocities, the lies and instabilities
All the lessons from the past help you survive

Chaos! I'm so confused
Chaos! Everlasting
Chaos! My spirit will not die
I'm fighting for life
Chaos! I'm so confused
Chaos! Never ending
Chaos! Our spirits will not die
I'm fighting for love

Eyes are shut to the world
Situation unimproved
The cancer of darkness grows
People tired and so confused

So many fallen souls lie about
Helpless as the time flows by
Find a light and cling to it
Hold on tight or fall behind

The story of a thousand tears sung upon a melody
Feeling beauty touch your heart and soul
Even pain and cruelties, the tests and the difficulties
Have a meaning in the end
Yes, you will survive

The story of a thousand dreams
Shown like on the TV screen
The knowledge from a thousand years gone by
Even the atrocities, the lies and instabilities
All the lessons from the past help you survive

Chaos! I'm so confused
Chaos! Everlasting
Chaos! My spirit will not die
I'm fighting for life
Chaos! I'm so confused
Chaos! Never ending

Chaos! Our spirits will not die
I'm fighting for love

I'm so confused - Everlasting
My spirit won't die - I'm fighting for life
I'm so confused - Everlasting
Our spirits won't die - I'm fighting for love
I'm so confused - Everlasting
My spirit won't die - I'm fighting for life
I'm so confused - Everlasting
Our spirits won't die - I'm fighting for love
