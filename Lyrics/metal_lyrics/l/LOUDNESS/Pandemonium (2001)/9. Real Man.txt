Back in my days of heedless ways
Life in a perfect standstill
I was going straight down the drain when
I got my morning call

It was a heartbeat, a brand new life
A kick of power that gave me a new sight
Just to feel the life growing inside
I think I fell in love

Welcome to the new world, darling angel
Baby, let me light your way
I will promise you anything, baby
I'll help you reach for the stars
Fear not anything, my darling angel
Baby, I could die for you
You turn darkness into light

Back in my days of endless daze
Looking for the answers of life
I was lost, head in a rut when
I heard a voice inside

You gotta make it right, let in the light
You should know that love will give you flight
The real man that you're holding inside
Will make you proud and tall

You bring joy to the world, oh my baby
Oh you're my shining star
I will promise you anything, my baby
You have the world in your hands
Angel, you are the springtime of my life
Baby, you make life anew
You turn darkness into light

Welcome to the new world, darling angel
Baby, let me light your way
I will promise you anything, baby
I'll help you reach for the stars
Fear not anything, my darling angel
Baby, I could die for you
You turn darkness into light

You bring joy to the world, oh my baby
Oh you're my shining star
I will promise you anything, my baby
You have the world in your hands
Angel, you are the springtime of my life
Baby, you make life anew
You turn darkness into light

Welcome to the new world, darling angel
Baby, let me light your way
I will promise you anything, baby
I'll help you reach for the stars
Fear not anything, my darling angel
Baby, I could die for you
You turn darkness into light
