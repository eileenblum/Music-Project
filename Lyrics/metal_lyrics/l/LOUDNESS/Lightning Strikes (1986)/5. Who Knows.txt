I've been captured by fantasy
Woke up inside her jealousy

Who knows, what she needs
I am moving at my own speed
She spins a web inside my mind
But the spell of her dance is leaving me blind

Torn myself on with from her grasp
Get away, this tempting won't last

Who knows, what she needs
I turn around, she reaches for me
She spins a web inside my mind
But the spell of her dance is leaving me blind

Time to take a stand!
Chasing after me
Take a stand and see!
-It isn't worth it
Time to take a stand!
How long? how long?
Try to make a scene!
It's a nightmare

Who knows, what she needs
I am moving at my own speed
She spins a web inside my mind
But the spell of her dance is leaving me blind

Time to take a stand!
It's happening to me
Take a stand and see!
She's not worth it
Time to take a stand!
How long? how long? how long?
Try to make a scene!
She's a nightmare
