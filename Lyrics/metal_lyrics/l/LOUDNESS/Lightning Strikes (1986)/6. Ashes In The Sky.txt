I never talk to guardian angels, never look at evil past
The dying swan of sad creation, going fast away
We are born again like a phoenix passing,
Vanish like a soldier's death,
Hear the breath of moving thunder.
Red hot blow the ashes to the sky...

Shadows of war, screamin' past lies
Shadows of war, emotional ties

It comes, a deeper nightmare.
Fly me away to the holy place
Can the keepers guide forever
Will they make us pay?
We are born again like a phoenix passing,
Vanish like a soldier's death,
Hear the breath of moving thunder.
Red hot blow the ashes to the sky...

Shadows of war, love has gone blind
Shadows of war, time out of mind

Can the keepers guide forever?
Will they make us pay?
We are born again like a phoenix passing,
Vanish like a soldier's death,
Hear the breath of moving thunder.
Red hot blow the ashes to the sky...

Shadows of war, time out of mind
Shadows of war, love has gone blind
Shadows of war, screamin' past lies
Shadows of war, emotional ties
Shadows of war, shadows of war
Shadows of war, shadows of war
Time out of mind
