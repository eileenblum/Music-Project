Woman, you are a butterfly
Dancing fire with savage grace
Man to man you freely ramble
Change your mind you change your face

Don't keep me waiting all night long
Don't keep me crying all night long
Don't take me down
Don't bring me down

Tellin' lies are what you're good for
What's this game you play?
I come close you keep your distance
I'm falling victim to your ways

Tell me if you still feel the same way for me
Tell me if you don't love me any more
Oh no, anymore
Oh no, anymore
