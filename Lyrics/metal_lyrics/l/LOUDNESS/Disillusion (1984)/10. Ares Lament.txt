You make me smile when I think of you
Although you're many miles away, far away
But my heart's lonely, I love you still
This clown can't laugh today

My arms are open for you
I need to hold you closer
Can't you see, you leave me so breathless
Why do you do this to me
I can't go on without you
I'll never leave you any more

I am so lonely, so what can I do?
Oh baby, oh baby
I am so lonely, so lonely for you
Oh baby, oh baby

I have nowhere to go, no one to hold
Nothing to keep me here, I've thrown it all away
My heart is lonely, but still I'll try
This clown won't cry today
