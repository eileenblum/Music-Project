A million stars above me
only one life to count them all
A thousand years of wishes for a simple man
Milky Way

Look as far as the eye can see
Try, if you can, to understand
I'm just a man of a planet in a galaxy
Milky Way

We are children of the universe
We are the first
One by one we seek to reach the stars
The future's ours

People are people
We all live to play this game
We turn on the wheel by stairways to the stars
Milky Way
