A hurricane, alive with death and danger
She struck me down, made me feel the power
Crazy guys, you'd better fear the reaper
Believe it now... it's mystic power!

After the storm, I see there's nothing standing
Death and destruction, corpses fill the city
I am reborn from those who died before me
Believe it now... it's mystic power!

Oh yeah, never ending fire, energy
Oh yeah, secret mystery, energy

YOU - ARE - ESPER!
ESPER! ESPER! ESPER!

You'll never know the feelings I have tasted
You'll never see, sensations I have wasted
The universe is open now before me
Sing me away... it's mystic power
