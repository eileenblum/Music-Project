Mother! The sea is deep and wide
Mother! Always by your side
Your love is forever
You gave me everything

Father! Wishing I was you
Father! Good and strong as you
My love is forever
You taught me everything

Don't break the chains you hold
You'd better believe the things you're told
They gave you everything
Your name, your place in time
Go and show the people the way to live
The time has come to give it all you got to give
Go and show the people the way to live
Don't forget, remember that love is forever

Brother! Don't wait for no one
Brother! Rising with the sun
Everything is up to you
Every word is true
