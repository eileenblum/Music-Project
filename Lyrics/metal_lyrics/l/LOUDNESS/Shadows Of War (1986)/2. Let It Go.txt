Driving to the top of the city,
Drive until I reach the view,
Where we used to try and see,
Our dream come true,

Stop the car, light a cigarette,
Fill the air with the radio,
And there's nothing I can do,
But think of you,

I was the one who talked about the other man,
I thought he was my friend, but you had other plans,
I just can't take that chance,
There ain't no looking back,
Just a victim of circumstance,
I helped you fall in love so,

Let it go!
Let it go! (Let it go!)
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!

When I dial your telephone number,
It's like I'm never home,
But I know it isn't true,
What's he doing with you?

I don't like to sleep alone, no
Doesn't seem to bother you,
As long as you are having fun,
You don't care what you do,

I was the one who talked about the other man,
I thought he was my friend, but you had other plans,
It's all gone by so fast,
There ain't no looking back,
Just a victim of circumstance,
I helped you fall in love so,

Let it go! (Let it go!)
Let it go! (Ooh, Let it!)
Let it go! (Let it go!)
Let it go!

I just can't take that chance,
There ain't no looking back,
Just a victim of circumstance,
I helped you fall in love!

Let it go! (Let it go!)
Let it go!
Let it go! (Fall in Love!)
Let it go!
Let it go! (Oh you gotta!)
Let it go!
Let it go! (Let it go!)
