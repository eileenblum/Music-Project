Burn through the night like a fireball
Nothing's gonna stop me
Fightin' through the humanless universe
See the fire in me

Rippin' through the sky and it never ends
Nothing's gonna stop me
Shout to the star an' they disappear
Wind spinnin' through me
I'm pullin' free, free from the mindless weight of gravity
I'm racin' fast, faster than any light you can see

Black star oblivion, stealing your mind
Black star oblivion, steal you blind

Burn through the night like a fireball
Nothin' gonna stop me
Fightin' through the humanless universe
See the fire in me
I'm pullin' free, free from the mindless weight of gravity
I'm racing fast, faster than any light you can see.

Black star oblivion, raiding your soul
Black star oblivion, takes control

Black star oblivion, I'm not to blame
Black star oblivion, livin' flame

Shoot on past the planets
Hey, the sun's gettin dim
I think I'm slowing down
Cold and empty all 'round
