Never talk to guardian angels, never look at evil past,
The dying swan of sad creation, going fast away.
We are born again like a phoenix passing,
Vanish like a soldier's death,
Hear the breath of moving thunder.
Red hot blow the ashes to the sky,

Shadows of war, screamin' past lies
Shadows of war, emotional ties

It comes, a deeper nightmare,
Fly away to the holy place,
Can the keepers guide forever,
Will they make us pay?
We are born again like a phoenix passing,
Vanish like a soldier's death,
Hear the breath of moving thunder,
Red hot blow the ashes to the sky,

Shadows of war, lovers gone blind
Shadows of war, time out of mind

Can the rulers guide forever, will they make us pay?
We are born again like a phoenix passing,
Vanish like a soldier's death,
Hear the breath of moving thunder,
Red hot blow the ashes to the sky.

Shadows of war, time out of mind
Shadows of war, lovers gone blind
Shadows of war, time out of mind
Shadows of war, lovers gone blind......
