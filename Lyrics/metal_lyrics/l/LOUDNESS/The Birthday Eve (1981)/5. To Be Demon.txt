Hear the sound of the stream
Silent green land

Who are you?
Where are you going?
Now you woke up
The soul wanders
Without destination

A love word learned
Gently mutters in the air

So now you and me wooh...
stay close let me hear your voice
Will you notice
my crying

Won't show it!  Don't want no friendly smiles
Bloodstained!  Same ugly face

On the corner of running world
Gently exists a land of green
