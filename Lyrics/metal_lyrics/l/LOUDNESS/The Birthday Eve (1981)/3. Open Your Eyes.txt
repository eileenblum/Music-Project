I can hear the footsteps
of one who's begun to flutter his wings
Strong and heavy..
hear the scream

Dream as big as the universe
Grasp it in your palm now
Open your eyes!

This earth will one day
become a land without life
Ugly people living on...
Even my tears have dried up

We need love We need love
Woo Yeah!! Open your eyes!!
