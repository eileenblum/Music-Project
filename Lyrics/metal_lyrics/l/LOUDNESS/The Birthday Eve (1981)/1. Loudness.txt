We are the Loudness
Come on now!!
High! I get get get

Don't keep yourself down
Shoot the nail up their stubborn heads
Unlink the chain and you're ready
All this time will be wasted

We are the "Loudness" guy
Feel in the sky
We are the "Loudness" guy
We feel high high.....

Loud tunes spill the fire
Can't figure out some people
To find a heavy word
Only crazies can do it.
