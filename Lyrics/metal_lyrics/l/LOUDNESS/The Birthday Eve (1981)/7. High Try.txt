Wake up man
Hurry and get up
If you lead an unlawful way
Feel the fear of getting crushed
Drag the tremble and tiredness

Woo Your confusion
Never run away never forget way
For your life for your love
Wake up man! Hi try!
Say no no no!

Woo it happens
when you realize
your selfishness and hate of this world
come on hurry and get up
Don't think fear

Wake up man, hurry and get up
If you lead an unlawful way
Feel the fear of getting crushed
Drag the tremble and tiredness
