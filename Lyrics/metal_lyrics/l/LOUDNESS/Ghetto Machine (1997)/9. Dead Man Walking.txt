You can see me pacing
My heart is racing
Walking in the rain
See the fire is burning
See my head is turning
Driving me insane
Feel my fists are tightening
Feel my teeth are grinding
Eating up my brain
Feel the fever rising
See my soul is fighting
Fire in my veins

What have you done to her?
You made her feel so sad
What have you done to her?
You made her feel so mad

She refused
Everytime I talk
She yells

No reason to fight
No reason to fight
No reason to fight

[*]
But I'm feeling like a
Dead man walking
I'm losing you
Dead man walking
I'm missing you
Dead man walking
I'm losing you
Dead man walking
I'm losing you, losing you

What have I done to her?
I made her feel so sad
What have I done to her?
I made her feel so mad

She abused
When I look in her eyes
She yells

No reason to fight
No reason to fight
No reason to fight

[Repeat *]

There's nothing
Nothing left to say
And I'm feeling like a
Dead man walking...
