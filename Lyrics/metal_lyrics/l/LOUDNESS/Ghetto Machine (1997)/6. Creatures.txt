I never wanted to come this way
I could not leave
I could not stay
Back street mama in a shark skin coat
Double feature at the cyber morgue

Got to got to get away
She's a rattle snake
Creeping through the night
Babylon screams from the midnight sun
Decadence calls &amp; I have to come

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Slides inside your veins
It's a killer's game
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night

Just another big mistake
Mind control
Playing give &amp; take
A voodoo dancer with mojo move
Dressed in black
I've got a heart attack

Got to got to get away
She's a rattle snake
Creeping through the night
Babylon screams from the midnight sun
Decadence calls &amp; I have to come

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Slides inside your veins
It's a killer's game
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
I cannot stop this subway to hell
Creatures of the night...

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Slides inside your veins
It's a killer's game
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Back in black!  Leather whips!

Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Slides inside your veins
It's a killer's game
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
Creatures of the night
I cannot stop this subway to hell

Creatures of the night
Blinded by the light
Creatures of the night
Creeping through the night
Come on little babe, let's break the law
Come on little babe, let's make the law
Creatures
