Maggots on the run
From these rotten guns
Slaughter the alley
Deep in this hell

Rock star's suicide
Liars seek &amp; hide
From the piggy smell
Marchin' to hell

Blame! Blame! Blame! Blame!
Everyday!

We know who we are
You know who we are
But I get tired
Tired of it all

Guilt!  Guilt!  Guilt!  Guilt!
Everyday!

Drink up the night
Suck up the light
Shut up &amp; fight
Back to the grave
Swallow your tears
Follow your fears
Hold back the knives
I am the slave!

You know who I am
I know who I am
But I get tired
Tired of it all

Slave!  Slave!  Slave!  Slave!
Everywhere!
