I wake up with
The devil hanging over my head
Sweet little sister
Calling my name
I just wanna
Lay on your flying bed
Heavy walls everywhere

I've been walking through
The road of thunder land
You can come into
The dream of Wonder Man
Wonder Man

Tell me do you wanna
Steal my soul
Deep inside of twilight

I've been walking through
The road of thunder land
You can come into
The dream of Wonder Man
Wonder Man
Wonder Man
Wonder Man
Come on!

I've been walking through
The road of thunder land
You can come into
The dream of Wonder Man
Wonder Man

I've been walking through
The road of thunder land
You can come into
The dream of Wonder Man
Wonder Man
Wonder Man
Wonder Man
Wonder Man

Without you
Without you
I am losing
I can't live without you
And I need you
Without you
