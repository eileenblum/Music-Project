Here we go!
The party is almost over now
But no one wants to leave
The clock is ticking 5 to 5
So sure time to sleep
Dancing around the candle lights
She walks into my room
Shadows moving with her spell
Can't you hear my screaming?

And I'm hypnotized
    I'm so confused

Endless end and nameless friends
I feel so strange &amp; blue
Colours changing everywhere
Can't you feel that you are dreaming?

And I'm hypnotized
    I'm so confused
    I'm wasting your time

Hey!

And I'm hypnotized
        Hypnotized
    I'm hypnotized
        Hypnotized...
