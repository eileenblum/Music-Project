[*]
Lust, hate, love
Through the burning heat
Lust, hate, love
Through the jungle beat
Lust, hate, love
Through the burning heat
Lust, hate, love
Through the burning heat

Swimming through the jungle river
To the acid sea
Walking under the burning sun
Waiting for the rain
I've been acting like a cave man
But I don't understand
I've been livin' through the stone ages
And I feel so strange

I'm gonna rush to the star light drive
I feel so free and join the tribe

[Repeat *]

Swimming through the jungle river
To the acid sea
I've been livin' through the stone ages
And I feel so strange

I'm gonna rock to the morning light
And I'm so free &amp; being alive
Swimmin' through the jungle river
Walkin' under the burning rain

[Repeat *]
