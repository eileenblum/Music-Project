Every night
There's a riot
From the isle of Alcatraz
Fog and sun
In burning roses
San Francisco in my sights

I wanna fly through the golden gate
I feel the night blowin' bright and wild
Woo yeah!

I can't get no satisfaction
Broken silence
And shattered dream
Where loudness rules
The damn thing fools
And love and hate
A just sixties scheme

I wanna fly through the golden gate
I feel the night blowin' bright and wild

I've awakened in San Francisco
Underneath her golden stars
Unforsaken here in San Francisco
Her rhapsody can heal my scars
San Francisco, San Francisco

I feel the moon is shinin' over me
She seems so real but it's all fantasy
Live in my fantasy

I've awakened in San Francisco
Underneath her golden stars
Unforsaken here in San Francisco
Her rhapsody can heal my scars
San Francisco, San Francisco
