Isolated
Violated
Complicated
And so jaded

Drive you crazy
Make you lazy
Smoke and dazy
Spasm baby

I don't remember
You don't remember
We don't remember
Life in December

Live my evil ecstasy
Inject your venom with your kiss
Live my evil fantasy
I'm going down, lost control

I'm your invader
Vibrator
Lover hater
Masturbator

Devil rider
Suicider
Try to hide her
Meat grinder

Live my evil ecstasy
Inject your venom with your kiss
Live my evil fantasy
I'm going down, lost control
Give me evil ecstasy
Ecstasy ...
