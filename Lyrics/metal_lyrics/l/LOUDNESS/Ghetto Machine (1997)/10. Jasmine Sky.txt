In the last hazy summer
Deep down the bottom of the sea
Sun is flooding through her hair
In the silence of soul
If I could stay with her now
Just take me away
Somewhere shadow of the sea
I feel so free, Feeling free

Somewhere in the light
I'm gonna crawl
Jasmine sky
Somewhere in the light
I'm gonna crawl
Jasmine sky

In the long coldest winter
Watching her sitting at the church
I can hear her in the river
She looks so sweet but not real
If I could pray with her now
I would die for her love
I lay on my empty bed
Nothing to do, all alone

Somewhere in the light
I'm gonna crawl
Jasmine sky
Somewhere in the sky
I can fly
Jasmine sky
Somewhere in the light
I'm gonna crawl
Jasmine sky
Somewhere in the sky
I can fly
Jasmine sky
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
