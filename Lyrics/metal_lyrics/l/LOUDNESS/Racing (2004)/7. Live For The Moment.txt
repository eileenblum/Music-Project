On the midnight highway
Gas pedal to the ground
Shrieking tires  It's howling
As the dawn approaches
The sky burns in flames
I'm gettin off  Driving high
We are the demons of the highway
Hang onto the steering wheel

[Chorus:]
Live for the moment (fight to be free)
Don't ever regret (fight to be free)
Let me hear you shout
Instinctive passion
Ignite fuel in me
Set off the fire
Your reason for desire
Throw all your rule books away
Breaking the chains of law and order
Unleash the beast in you right now
We are the monsters of the highway
The sensation fires off in our head
Live for the moment (fight to be free)
Don't ever regret (fight to be free)
Let me hear you shout
The devil inside
It's bursting through my veins

[Chorus]

Live for the moment
Fight to be free
Don't ever regret
Fight to be free
Let me hear you shout
Fight to be free
