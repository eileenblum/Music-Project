Elixir of the life Primeval pulse that beats
Precious DNA  Infinite loop
God's will is the only inheritance
The Creator's eternal art
It's all in God's will
Elixir of life
Rebellion makes a cell cancerous
Beyond the limit of reproduction
Manipulated and engineered
God's chromosomes are modified
God's will is the only inheritance
The Creator's perfect art

[Chorus:]
You're the one I love so true
You're my telomerase
You give me death or give me eternal life
How do I get to heaven's door?
You won't let me decide my own destiny
You're my destiny  Telomerase
You're the one I love so true
You're my telomerase
You're taking my blood, my body and soul
My life is in your hands
You won't let me decide my own destiny
You're my destiny  Telomerase
My life, it's all in your hands
The bitter end of an immortal cell
Will be drawn in to hell and dwell
Accept death and obey his word
Determines the destination
God's will is the only inheritance
The Creator's perfect art

[Chorus]

Elixir of life
