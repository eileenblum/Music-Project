Blastin' through the highway
Daredevil on the road
We're in the war zone  Can't slack off my speed
I'm a real deal  Bad-assed piece of steel
Pushin' to the limit  Leaving all behind
A Mad Racer
Racing like hell
Head to a goal
Howling and growling like a mad bull
Thundering engine rattles my skull
It's a need for speed I will not concede
Nothing's gonna stop my mean machine
Crazy Racer
Racing like hell
Head to a goal
It's now or never
I'm doing whatever it takes to get me even higher

[Chorus:]
We are rolling over the highway
We won't look back Never hold back
You might say we're going down the lost highway
No one can stop and hold us back
I am not sorry for all my misdeeds
Dance with the devil A killer demon speed
On the razor's edge Pain and pleasure engage
An evil appetite gives a green light
A Mad Racer
Racing like hell
Head to a goal
Roaring and growling like a mad bull
Thundering engine rattles my skull
It's a need for speed I will not concede
Nothing's gonna stop my mean machine
Atsui Racer
Racing like hell
Head to a goal
Caught in the middle of paradox and riddle
Just trust yourself and you'll see

[Chorus]

It's now or never
I'm doing whatever it takes to get me even higher

[Chorus]
