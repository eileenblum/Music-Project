A juvenile survivor of war
Shell-shocked and terrified
Mass brutal killing and insanity
Bloodstained streets in chaos
Just another genocide
Trapped inside a vortex of loss and despair
Blood money worth few pennies
Not enough to nourish his soul
Suicide bomb is the only way out
Exhausted by fear
Numbed to harsh reality
No chance to see the grass turn green

[Chorus:]
May your soul rest in peace baby
May you rest in peace baby
Angels lick and heal your open wounds
Let my soul rest in peace baby
Let me rest in peace baby
Embraced you'll be for all eternity
Let's not pretend to justify
Let's not pretend to justify
A drop of tear dripping into
A scar that could not heal
The wound is begging for mercy
The time has come for you
I can hear you whispering
It's time to say good-bye
Won't you close youreyes

[Chorus]

May your soul rest in peace baby
And your mercy be eternal
Flying over clouds of bliss  Gate is near
Let my soul rest in peace baby
'Cause I'm tired of the hatred
Brighter days ahead  It's a matter of time
Let's not pretend to justify
Let's not pretend to justify
