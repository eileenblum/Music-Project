I know you are scared
I know you are afraid
I know you are nothing
Won't you get out of my sight
Before I beat the sh** out of you
You miserable and worthless creature
A natural born finger-pointer
Who the hell you think you are?
All that you can do  Trembling with fear
Hey loser you'd better shut your mouth
Be a man, die like a man

[Chorus:]
We'll never give up  Exultation
Never surrender  Exultation
We will fight to win  Exultation
With all our might  Exultation

Don't let it get you down
You'd better better better learn to run
You'd better better better learn to think
You'd better better better learn to see
You'd better learn to learn
Who the hell think you are?
Jealousy and slander
Hey you loser you'd better shut your mouth
Won't you realize that your life is in your hands

[Chorus]

Who the hell think you are?
Jealousy and slander
Hey loser you'd better shut your mouth
Won't you realize that your life is in your hands

[Chorus]

Don't you ever hang your head
Stand your ground  Straight and tall
