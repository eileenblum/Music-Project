I'm so freezing â Help me out
Cannot stop shivering â Let me out

Help me out
Don't know how to grab your real soul
Don't know how â Losing control
Don't know nothing

You were never in my arms
But don't despise me
Don't wanna be alone alone
Don't disappear now
Don't wanna be alone alone
Never say good night
Never say good bye
I don't wanna leave you now

I'm so scared â Help me out
I'm in despair â Let me out

Let me out
Don't know what I wanted from you
Don't know what â You were not true
Don't know nothing

You were never in my arms
But you were blissful in my dream
Don't wanna be alone alone
I'll never forget you â I'll never hate you
Just don't wanna be alone alone
Never say good night
Never say good bye
I don't wanna leave you now

You were never in my arms
But don't despise me
Don't wanna be alone alone
Don't disappear now
Don't wanna be alone alone
Never say good night
Never say good bye
I don't wanna leave you now

Never say good night
Never say good bye
Don't wanna leave you â No no
