I got no education but I will do the right thing
Got no communication but I will do the right thing
Everything happens for a reason
Nothing is by chance
the crack of doom is coming
The end is creeping near

[Chorus:]
Ding Dong!  Ding Dong!
Ding Dong!  Ding Dong!
Fire!  Fire!
Burning Burning
Burning Burning
See the blast wave
Ding Dong!  Ding Dong!
Ding Dong!  Ding Dong!
Fire!  Fire!
Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!
Feel the shock wave
Fire!  Fire!
Ding Dong!  Ding Dong!
Ding Dong!  Ding Dong!
See the blast wave
You've gotta do it right now
Before it's too late
'Cause tomorrow is not promised
You've gotta do it your own way
Labyrinth is calling
The world's on fire
The mob goes wild
I'm on fire

[Chorus]
