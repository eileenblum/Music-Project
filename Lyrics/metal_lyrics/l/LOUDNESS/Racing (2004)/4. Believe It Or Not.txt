Cast a spell to wish me well 'cause I'm going under
Awakened by a loud crash of lightning and thunder
Crawling cloud looms over and all I can do is wonder
From above The miraculous power of words
I hear the voices
If there is a will, there is a way
If you believe, you are gonna make it
If there is a will, there is a way
If you make a wish, your wish is to come true
It's unbelievable  Believe it or not
It's indescribable  Believe it or not
I was reborn and felt the jolt running down my spine
Hypnotized Mesmerized by the power of divine
Blast off for the outer limits and beyond
From above The miraculous power of words
I hear the voices
If there is a will, there is a way
If you believe, you are gonna make it
If there is a will, there is a way
May your wish come true
May your wish come true
It's unbelievable  Believe it or not
It's indescribable  Believe it or not
It's unbelievable  Believe it or not
It's indescribable  Believe it or not
It's unavoidable
It's uncontrollable
It's unbelievable  Believe it or not
It's indescribable  Believe it or not
