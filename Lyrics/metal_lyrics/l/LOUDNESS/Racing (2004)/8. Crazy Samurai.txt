I've been treated like a crackpot
Labeled a freak and whatnot
Just a misfit of society
With my wandering nature
Living life catch-as-catch-can
Born rebel  Call me samurai
Let my instinct have its way
Take me where it may
Sharp blade shines with intuition
Bathe in honor and respect
Code of warrior to protect
Pave the path to your own future

[Chorus:]
I'm taklin' about Crazy Samurai
Crazy Crazy
That's what they call me  A Big Time Samurai
I'm taklin' about Crazy Samurai
Crazy Crazy
That's what I wanna be  A Big Time Samurai
High strung drunken bastard
Reality becomes so damn blurred
'Til I see the fire or the clouds
Heaven or hell it depends
Who you ask Satan or god
We are in a temptation world
Caving to nasty greed
The devil smiles 'cause he succeeds
You can run but you can't hide
No escape  No salvation
Trapped in pain  no redemption
Forever lives  Crazy Samurai

[Chorus]

Don't stop moving
We're gonna make you lose control
You got the feeling I got the feeling
Say Ride on, ride on!
Say Ride on, ride on!
You got a feeling all right yeah!
You got a feeling all right yeah!
Say yeah yeah!  Say yeah yeah!  Say yeah!  YEAH!
Say yeah yeah!  Say yeah yeah!  Say yeah!  YEAH!
Don't stop moving
We're gonna make you lose control
You got the feeling I got the feeling
Say Ride on, ride on!
Say Ride on, ride on!
You got a feeling all right yeah!
You got a feeling all right yeah!
Ain't talkin' about "WAR"
Ain't talkin' about "GUN"
Ain't talkin' about "BOMB"
Ain't talkin' about "LIE"
