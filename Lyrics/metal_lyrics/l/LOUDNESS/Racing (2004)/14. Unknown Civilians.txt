Landmine â Landmine
We're surrounded
Landmine â Landmine

Screaming â Screaming
For a savior
Screaming â Screaming

Caught in a spiral of everlasting curse
Tomorrow seems so far away
Cycle of bloodshed â Dark days ahead
No way out from this blaze

Unknown civilians killed in a war
It means destruction of innocent lives
Life has no meaning
In this game that they play
But tears in my eyes

Liar â Liar
Peaceful tomorrow
Liar â Liar

Destroyed â Destroyed
Hopes and desires
Destroyed â Destroyed

Breaking the silence and rings through the night
Bells of hell for you
Calling of innocents make you contrite?
A prayer for a wishing well

Unknown civilians killed in a war
Blood for blood
For no reasons at all
No more pain and no more suffering
No more death
No more war

Unknown civilians killed in a war
It means destruction of innocent lives
Life has no meaning
In this game that they play
But tears in my eyes

Unknown civilians killed in a war
Blood for blood
For no reasons at all
No more pain and no more suffering
No more death
No more war

No more pain
No more death
No more war
No more war
