Slain by a psycho killer
Shedding tears in a silent rage
There's no place to vent the anger
Allow me to retaliate
It's an evil patronage
Left-winged, hiding their faces
You're a media parasite
Feeding victims to the lions
Lunatics  They are on the run
Faked innocence
Lunatics  They are on the run

[Chorus:]
Lunatic  Let him go
Ain't guilty  Let him go
Lunatic Lunatic
Who's it for?  Human Rights
Crumbling Down  Human Rights
Don't you turn your eyes away
You never learn from tragedy
Is it gonna be the same again?
Are we the ones to pay the price?
The boy call himself a psycho
Exploiting legal loopholes
Once he acts all paranoid
The human rights will set him free

[Chorus]

Who's it for?  Human Rights?
Crumbling Down  Human Rights
Filthy as sin  Human Rights
Evil-eyed  Human Rights
Who's it for?  Human Rights?
Crumbling Down  Human Rights
Who's it for?  Human Rights?
Crumbling Down  Human Rights
Filthy as sin  Human Rights
Evil-eyed  Human Rights
Lunatic  Let him go
