The empire of entertainment
New faces come and go
Mass produced reproductions
Tweedledum and dee
Do I see the dÃ©jÃ  vu?
Hey man, don't give me that bullshit
Faked songs with faked emotions
Every line lacks faith and devotion

Oh, we've had enough
Sick and tired of the same ol' stuff
Oh, give me the real thing
How dare you? So disgusting
You are joker â You are liar
You are loser â Heartbreaker

Power generation
We're the ones that make a difference
No more fake ass

Faceless masses of the web
Loud-mouthed and out of control
Epidemic hysteria and sensation
Are we talking about music or
Are we just a toy here to amuse you?
Mass consumption â Mass disposal
Money talks, bullshit walks

Oh, we've had enough
Sick and tired of the same ol' stuff
Oh, give me the real thing
How dare you? So disgusting
You are joker â You are liar
You are loser â Heartbreaker

Power generation
We're the ones that make a difference
No more fake ass
Power generation
We know that we can make it real

Oh, we've had enough
Sick and tired of the same ol' stuff
Oh, give me the real thing
How dare you? So disgusting
You are joker â You are liar
You are loser â Heartbreaker

You are joker â You are liar
You are loser â Heartbreaker
