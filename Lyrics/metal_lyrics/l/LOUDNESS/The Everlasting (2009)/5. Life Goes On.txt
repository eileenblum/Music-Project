I hear my heart, a voice of the soul, deep inside of me
It says "Believe in your own powers,
Believe in your own potential!

Wondering from time to time, trying to find the truth
Finding the will to carry on
Finding the will to rock on

Oh yeah, life goes on!

We're living for rock and roll
Always another show
Wheels go round and round
Survive until the end
Our show must go on
Our lives go on...

We live to rock and roll
We're finding our souls
We're following our dreams
Backwards and forwards
Our show must go on
Our lives go on...

Our lives goes on...
Our lives goes on...

You're on my mind
My hopeless heart sleeps alone tonight
I wish I could call you tonight
You give me the power to believe

Wondering from time to time, trying to find the truth
Finding the will to carry on
Finding the will to rock on
