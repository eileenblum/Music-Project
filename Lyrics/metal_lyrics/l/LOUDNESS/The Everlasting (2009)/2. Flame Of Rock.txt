You are the hero - the flame of rock
And now your spirits take us higher
As you stand by us FOREVER!!!

Fighting the demons inside us
Blood rushing through our veins
Give us the strength to be strong
So strong!

Light my way, way to heaven
Where the spirits come to rock
We'll carry the flame, the flame of rock
Like a never ending sunrise

Like a never ending sunrise!

Burning! Burning! The flame of rock!!!
The flame of rock will never die
Burning! Burning! The flame of rock!!!
The eternal flame will never die

Traveling with no direction
No time for fear, no time for tears
Cause you'll stand by us forever

We all long for your touch
Your power makes us complete
Your spirit fills our soul
You make us strong, so strong!

Light my way, way to heaven
Where the spirits come to rock
We'll carry the flame, the flame of rock
Like a never ending sunrise

Like a never ending sunrise!

Burning! Burning! The flame of rock!!!
The flame of rock will never die
Burning! Burning! The flame of rock!!!
The eternal flame will never die
