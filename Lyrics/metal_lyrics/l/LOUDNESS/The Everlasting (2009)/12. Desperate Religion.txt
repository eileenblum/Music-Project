All burned alive and torn apart
An eternal servant Die in agony
Down in a spiral of tragedy
Who's to be blamed?
Believe in a desperate religion

Dedicate your life to the service of God
Desperate religion ..on and on..
It's all an illusion
Cut the puppet strings now....
A desperate oh...addiction...
A desperate oh...religion...

You're a sacrifice Your brain is frozen
THe choice you're making isn't really yours
Down in a spiral of lunacy
You're under control
Believe in a desperate religion

Dedicate your life to the service of God
Desperate religion ..on and on..
It's all an illusion
Cut the puppet strings now....
Your blind faith is over
You have to carry on
See, it's all man-made - some words of GOD
Deep inside your self
Carved in your mind
Fear and fright, terrified suffer in despair
A desperate oh...addiction...
A desperate oh...religion...
