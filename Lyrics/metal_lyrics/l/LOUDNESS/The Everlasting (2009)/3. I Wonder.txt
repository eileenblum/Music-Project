Memories of days gone by
You're a star now
Shine so bright
I wake to find you're not there anymore

In the mist your halo's so strong
I can feel you right by my side
In my dream you're still here with me
Don't let my dream fade into darkness

I'm screaming inside
I wonder if you'll ever find your way home
I'll remember you my dear
I wonder if you would remember me

Embracing my despair
Trying to fill the void
Seasons change but never change our minds
In a passage of time we transcend
Even death can't part us now
Like the tide that comes in and out
You're in my dream night after night

I'm screaming inside
I wonder if you'll ever find your way home
I'll remember you my dear
I wonder if you would remember me

Time has come for me to live another day
Open my eyes now, I realize a day, realize a place

I'm screaming inside
I wonder if you'll ever find your way home
I'll remember you my dear
I wonder if you would remember me
I'll remember you...
