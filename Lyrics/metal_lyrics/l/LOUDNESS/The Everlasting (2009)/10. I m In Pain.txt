Oh yeah! My faith to you I can prove it's true ..all I see is you
Oh yeah! I need someone that can hold me tight...
someone that ties me down
I'm in pain
I'm in pain

Right before my eyes
I'm blinded you're my light
I'm begging you please
(I'm) Down on my knees
But you are out of reach
And I am out of touch
Won't you tell you need me
You're driving me crazy
Devoted to you I'm a fool
I'm in pain
I'm in pain

I am bound in chains of authority ...bound by insanity Oh yeah!
I'm losing touch with the reality...made-up fantasy

Love is the answer, love is all I see
Love is an agony and it's a torture
Love is in me but love's killing me,
Love binds me and it blinds me
Losing my sane
Adore in vain
I'm in pain
I'm in pain
