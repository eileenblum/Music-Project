Hit me! Band!
Wooh wow!

Thunder burn!
You got me rocking
Let's get funky
Hit me, band!

Thunder burn!
You got the fever in a cold sweat
Hit me, band!

This is a man - a prisoner of you
I'm crying my heart out for you
I'm losing myself in you
I'm trying to get back, but I can't get back to being myself...

I'm so frustrated by your perfection
And I can't get you out of my mind
Oh yeah! Soul power! I've got to have it now!
Oh yeah! Soul power! I can feel it now!

You got me frustrated by a life that you own
Give the dog a bone! Give the dog a bone!
Oh yeah! Soul power! I've got to have it now!
Oh yeah! Soul power! I can feel it now!

This is a man - a prisoner of you
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
I'm losing myself in you
I'm trying to get back, but I can't get back to being myself

You got me frustrated, you tease me like hell
And I can't get you out of my mind
Oh yeah! Soul power! I've got to have it now!
Oh yeah! Soul power! I can feel it now!

I'm so frustrated by your perfection
Give the dog a bone! Give the dog a bone!
Oh yeah! Soul power! I've got to have it now!
Oh yeah! Soul power! I can feel it now!

Thunder burn!
You got me rocking
Let's get funky
Hit me, band!

Thunder burn!
You got the fever in a cold sweat
Hit me, band!
