Let's stand up for rock and roll
Let's set this place on fire
Sand by......to blast off!!
It's non-stop "rock"

Living for today, ridin' into a danger
Yeah!!! Let's get started
Come on fell the "rock"

You've got the fire! Just let it out!
We know what you want!
Stand up and let it out! Shout it out!
If you're lookin' for satisfaction?

There's nothing like live R&amp;R
Live wired and ready to ROCK!!!
Rock, let's Rock...till the sun goes down!!!
What the hell you waiting for?
Gonna set this place on fire
Oh Yeah!!! Let's get started
Come on feel the "rock"

You've got the fire! Just let it out!
We know what you want!
Stand up and let it out! Shout it out!
If you're lookin' for satisfaction?

Hey! Let's rock into the night!
Let's get wild and wasted!
Hey! Let's rock
Hey! Let's rock
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Let's rock
