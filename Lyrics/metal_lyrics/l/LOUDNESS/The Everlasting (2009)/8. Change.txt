Now is the time
To hear the sound of freedom
So many candles in the wind
The wind of changes is blowing

It's better now than never
It's been a long comin'
So now a change has come
You can't hide in the ashes

Feel the glory of change
Make it last forever

It's time for change
We turn out faces to the sky
We've been waiting for the wind of change
We are the change we seek

It's time to change
We all must stand together
We'll say the words and be free, Screaming out loud
We are the change we seek

If you wanna see a change
And stop the war on terror
We gotta shout and pray
So we can change the world

You better change your head
You better free your mind
So now a change has come
See the light from the dust
