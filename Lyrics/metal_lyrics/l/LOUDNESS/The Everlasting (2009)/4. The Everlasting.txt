Moving at the speed of light
Faster goes my heart beat
Hear the sound of hurricane
Raging through the blackened sky

God! I'm playing
Till the end of time
Fighting through the days of thunder
Fighting through the days of lighting

The everlasting
I wish I could give you lightness
Return to forever
I wish I could give you loudness

Hey! - All night long
Hey! Hey! - No reason No secret
Hey! - Rock through the night time
Hey! Hey! - (There is) no end, we'll keep on rocking

Let me see you break a sweat
Looking for kicks I'm shaking
Don't blow off your flame of fire
Burn it bright until it's gone

The everlasting
I wish I could give you lightness
Return to forever
I wish I could give you loudness
The everlasting
I wish I could give you lightness
Return to forever
I wish I could give you loudness

Hey! - All night long
Hey! Hey! - No reason No secret
Hey! - Rock through the night time
Hey! Hey! - (There is) no end, we'll keep on burning!

The everlasting
I wish I could give you lightness
Return to forever
I wish I could give you loudness
