The fireworks in the night
Hey! Raise your hands up into the light
You will never fade away

We stand here together tonight
'Cause we fight for the rock
Rock with us all night and day

Rock until your dreams come true
Rock until your dreams come true
Let it rock!

Let the rock be explored,
Hey! Raise you voices higher
Make you come alive tonight
We can take you higher

We stand here together tonight
'Cause we fight for the rock
Make you come alive tonight
We can take you higher

Rock until your dreams come true
Rock until your dreams come true
Let it rock!

Let it rock!
No matter what they say
Let it rock!
Don't change your ways
Let it rock!
No matter what they say
Let it rock!
Don't change your ways
Let it rock!
Fight for the rock
Let it rock!
Don't change your ways
