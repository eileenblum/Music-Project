I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track
Forget today, forget tomorrow
Just looking out ahead
To keep my mind strong
Heard that whistle blowing
Lonesome in my mind
Never-ending trails

I reflect on my demons in the night
Rolling 'round the bend all night lone

Hit the rails!
Drive me insane on a crazy train
Roll and roll!

Rolling in the wast, rolling to the east
There is a rat race, there is a human race
There's always free cheese inside a rattrap
I'm sick and tired of a rat race
Fury breaks the chain
Let's go

I reflect on my demons in the night
Rolling 'round the bend all night lone

Hit the rails!
Drive me insane on a crazy train
Roll and roll!
Break the chain!
