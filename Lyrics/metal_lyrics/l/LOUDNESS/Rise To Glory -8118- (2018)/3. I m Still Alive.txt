Stay alive!

Time flies
Donât let them waste it
Move on

Go ahead
Life ainât eternal
Walk on

You are the one in control of your life
You are the law
Breaking the shackle of your delusion
Be as you are

Alive, Iâm here Iâm alive
Denied and dead but alive
Collide, Crash, Dive, Survive
Stand tall
Yes, Iâm still alive

Donât fake and lie to your heart
Embrace
Awake to your passion
A calling

You are the one in control of your life
You are the law
Breaking the shackle of your delusion
Be as you are

Alive, Iâm here Iâm alive
Denied and dead but alive
Collide, Crash, Dive, Survive
Stand tall
Yes, Iâm still alive

âDead or Aliveâ
âDead or Aliveâ
âDead or Aliveâ
âDead or Aliveâ

Fly high, high as the sun
Youâve got the wings to fly
Fly higher

Donât stop
Until youâre proud
Gotta make them beg for more
Beg for more
