Chains of love
Like a spell from above
Time is running and I just canât find the answer

Round and round
In this dream I have found
Itâs all a vision that you hold in your affection

Never ending desire
Takes you to endless fire

Feel the fear creeping up in this nightmare
Hold your tears in the shadows of darkness
Drowning in the deepness of this hate

Walking cuz I gotta fight
I keep walking âtil I see the light

Shout it out
When youâre feeling in doubt
Keep on fighting when you face into your hunger

Reach the sky
Youâre a brave samurai
There ainât nothing than can stand in your way

Never ending desire
Takes you to endless fire

All these feelings of a blind desperation
Just a vision haunting your imagination
Keep dreaming cuz itâs up to you!

Walking cuz I gotta fight
I keep walking âtil I see the light
