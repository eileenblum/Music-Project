Drowned in the darkness
Wonât you light my way
Iâm going to vanish
All without a trace

Comes a fear of feeling out of place
Wake to nightmare
Eyes without a face

Iâm trying to break a spell
Crawling out of hell
Canât you hear me yell?
Banging the bell
Iâve got no soul to sell
But a thing or two to tell
I know my heart is frail
But I just canât fail

Trapped in the middle
Shouldâve known long ago
Deeper in I go
Eternal vertigo

Feeling so small
More than you know
Missing my soul
The body is hollow

Iâm trying to break a spell
Crawling out of hell
Canât you hear me yell?
Banging the bell
Iâve got no soul to sell
But a thing or two to tell
I know my heart is frail
But I just canât fail

Sky above
Endless universe
Break the chains
That are tying you to the ground
âTil we hit the ceiling
âTil we hit the ground
Shout out your anger
Shout out your rage

Forget tomorrow
Give up the past
Embrace the power within you
Lifeâs an illusion
Fades like a flame
Nothing to be scared of
All thing must pass

Forget tomorrow!
Give up the past!

Iâm trying to break a spell
Crawling out of hell
Canât you hear me yell?
Banging the bell
Iâve got no soul to sell
But a thing or two to tell
I know my heart is frail
But I just canât fail

Sky above
Endless universe
Break the chains
That are tying you to the ground
âTil we hit the ceiling
âTil we hit the ground
Shout out your anger
Shout out your rage

Forget tomorrow!
Give up the past!
