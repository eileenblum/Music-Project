Never stop and live to rock
Never stop to roll
Never stop and live to fight
Time to go ignite

Hail! And Hail!
Weâre gonna keep on rockinâ you
Keep it burning! Fire it up!
We are the rising sun!

Take the world by storm
Hear the sound of thunder
Break away! Break away!
Break away, engage
Here it comes, weâll set you free!

Massive Tornado!
Massive Tornado!
Here we go!

Never give up when hope is lost
Never give up trust
Never give up what we love
Keep on trying, we must

Hail! And Hail!
Weâre gonna keep on rollinâ you
Keep it blazing! Fire it up!
We are the rising sun!

Take the world by storm
Hear the sound of thunder
Break away! Break away!
Break away, engage
Here it comes, weâll set you free!

Massive Tornado!
Massive Tornado!
Here we go!
