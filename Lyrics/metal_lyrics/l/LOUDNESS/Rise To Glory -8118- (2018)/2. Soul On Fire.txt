Yeah, it blew my mind away on a summer day, back in â75
Out of the blue like a miracle
It was ringing like a bell, put me on a spell, took my heart away
Star-struck, I dreamed of the spectacle

Crank it up high, Iâm on standby, ready to satisfy,
Feel the passion in your blood
Look into my eyes, feeling the heat rise, youâre gonna realize
No oneâs stopping me tonight

We gonna rock you
Gonna scream and shout now
Into the red zone
Gonna burn you up now, get your soul on fire

Yeah, weâre hrading to yout town, gonna melt you down,
Blazing in the night
Shining on you like the neon lights
Itâs the spirit of the night telling us to fight
âtil the morning sun
Keeping us burning forevermore

Crank it up high, Iâm on standby, ready to satisfy,
Feel the passion in your blood
Look into my eyes, feeling the heat rise, youâre gonna realize
No oneâs stopping me tonight

We gonna rock you
Gonna scream and shout now
Into the red zone
Gonna burn you up now, get your soul on fire

We gonna rock you
Gonna scream and shout now
Into the red zone
Gonna burn you up now
We gonna rock you
Gonna scream and shout now
Into the red zone
Get your soul on fire

Soul on fire!
