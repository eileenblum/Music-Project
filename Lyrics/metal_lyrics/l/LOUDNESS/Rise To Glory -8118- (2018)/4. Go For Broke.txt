I donât know, I donât know why youâre afraid
Looking for a reason, just a way out

You donât know, you donât know that itâs your fate
You could have it all, without a doubt

The golden gate will come to you, reach your hand
Donât you stop take your chances
Another day goes by, there is no time to waste
Now is the time to make stance

I donât know, I donât know whatâs on your mind
You just seem tied up within your cell

You donât know, you donât know that youâve been blind
You could let it go and just be yourself

The golden gate will come to you, reach your hand
Donât you stop take your chances
Another day goes by, there is no time to waste
Now is the time to make stance

We can break out
Break out and go for broke
No need for regrets, just donât you choke
We can break out
Break out, just donât you choke
No need for regrets, just donât you choke

The golden gate will come to you, reach your hand
Donât you stop take your chances
Another day goes by, there is no time to waste
Now is the time to make stance

We can break out
Break out and go for broke
No need for regrets, just donât you choke
We can break out
Break out, just donât you choke
No need for regrets, just donât you choke
