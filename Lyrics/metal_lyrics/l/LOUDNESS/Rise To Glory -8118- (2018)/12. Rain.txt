Walking in the rain
Drenched to my soul
Itâs so cold I shiver
It heals the pain

All of my fear and suffering
Take shape like a scene
In a kaleidoscope within my mind
Donât you know

In the sky thereâs a rainbow
Donât you realize itâs now just a dream

So tired from walking
This road is endless
I canât see the end, just a mirage

I feel so empty
All my tears have dried
But I will keep on walking

Oh God, please show me the way
Give me a sign
Is this the way?

In the sky thereâs a rainbow
Donât you realize itâs now just a dream

Alone again
All alone in the rain
Oh, let this rain
Wash away all my pain
