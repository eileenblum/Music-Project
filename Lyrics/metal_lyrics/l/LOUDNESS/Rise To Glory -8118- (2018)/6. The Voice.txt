I hear a voice that keeps calling meâ¦
desperately
Echo in the silence of the midnight seaâ¦
helplessly
These tears in my eyes
They flow on endlessly
Still binding my heart
From my innocence

I keep asking myself for the answer
Another day after day
Still waiting to feel the emotion now

Picking up the pieces of my broken heartâ¦
I fall apart
Walking alone this road I carry onâ¦ on and on
Something in the night
It just keeps telling me
To stand up once again to find destinyâ¦
Waiting for me

I keep asking myself for the answer
Another night after night
Still waiting to feel the sensation now

Then I realizeâ¦
When I see the stars shining in the sky
Itâs the realityâ¦
Itâs the call to your heart
When you hear the voiceâ¦ yeah!

Hear the prophecy

Then I realizeâ¦
When I see the stars shining in the sky
Itâs the realityâ¦
Itâs the call to your heart
When you hear the voiceâ¦ yeah!

Yes, I realizeâ¦
When I see the stars shining in the sky
Itâs the realityâ¦
Itâs the call to your heart
When you hear the voiceâ¦ yeah!
