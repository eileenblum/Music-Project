Take off the mask that you hide behind
All your deceptions come to light
Manipulate and propagate
People are awake to reality

Canât you see
Misery
Creeping up on us

Know the reason weâre fighting for
Youâre breaking through the metal door
We cannot stand by
And watch our children die
Soldiers are dread in the battlefield
Raising no flag guns are sealed
âDisarm the nationâ you say
âFor the sake of peaceâ

Whoâs got your back? Shady and black
Misleading the masses, a tragedy
Seeding your hate like masturbating
Betraying the enemy within

Canât you see
Misery
Creeping up on us

Know the reason weâre fighting for
Youâre breaking through the metal door
We cannot stand by
And watch our children die
Soldiers are dread in the battlefield
Raising no flag guns are sealed
âDisarm the nationâ you say
âFor the sake of peaceâ
