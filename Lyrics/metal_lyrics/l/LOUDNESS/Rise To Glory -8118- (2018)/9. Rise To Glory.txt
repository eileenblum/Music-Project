From the Far East
We came to conquer
Across the seven seas

Gonna blow your mind
Ad rock you harder
We are sure to please

Roll like a thunder, a streak of lightning
Weâre gonna shake your ground
To the red and white we hail
Raise your fists up and yell

Arise!
From our ashes
Stand tall! Loud and proud
Donât fall
Gotta get movinâ
Stand tall and glory be!

Blowing up the fuse
Crank it louder
Breaking all taboos

Bang your head to heavy metal thunder
Weâre gonna rock tilâ weâre gone

Câmon!
Gonna rock you, piss off
Say âYeah!â Loud and proud
Donât fall
Gotta get movinâ
Stand tall and glory be!

We shall rise to glory
Rise above
Make the sun rise again
We shall vow

Do or die, weâre ready
Ask not why
Loud and proud until the end of time

Arise!
Stand tall!
Glory be!
Glory be!
