You've been running around
Trying to keep me hungry
It doesn't mean a thing to me

Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it

What's this talk I'm hearing
You can't take the heat
If you ask me I'll just say

Take it or leave it

You don't like the way I'm up and down
You should know
If you can't understand
Then baby, maybe you should go

Will this ever end
Or is this just beginning
This shit has got to hit the fan

Take it or leave it

Don't you know you've gotta
Take the good with the bad
You should take the time
To realize what you had

Well if you don't like it
You can use the door
Find yourself another life

Take it or leave it

You've been running around
Trying to keep me hungry
It doesn't mean a thing to me

Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it

Take it
