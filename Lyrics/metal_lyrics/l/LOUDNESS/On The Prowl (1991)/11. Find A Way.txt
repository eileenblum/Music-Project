I see the world
Through different eyes than you
Time is the key
And my heart is locked and waiting

I'm coming home to hold you
I know it's hard to be alone, for so long

I'll find a way, ooh, someday
To get right back to you
Find the time, cross the line
Make all your dreams come---

When we're alone
Gonna make you feel alright
No more fears, no more tears
I'm gonna hold you, oh, so tight
Just close your eyes, start counting
And when they open I'll be home, right next to you

Just keep holding on
I'm always going to find a
Find a way to you

Just can't be too soon
You know I'm going to find a
Find a way to you

Eyes to the sky
It's of you I'm always dreaming
Cursing the ground
That keeps me from you

No time for dreaming
I'l find a way, I'll find a way
No time for praying
May be today, I'll find a way

Just can't be too soon
You know I'm going to find a
Find a way to you

I'll find a way
Ooh, someday
To get right back to you
Find the time, cross the line
Make all your dreams come true
I'll find a way
Ooh, someday
To get right back to you
Find the time, cross the line
Make all your dreams come true
