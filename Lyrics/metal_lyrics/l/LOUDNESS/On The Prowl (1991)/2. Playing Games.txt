When I first saw her face
Thought she was the girl for me
Never knew, had no clue, now I found
Playing is the key

She's got you down on your knees and you know
You should get away from her
Could it be that you're losing control

Can't you see, she's just playing games
Her fantasy, she's just playing games

Now the tables have turned
And you're feeling like you should
Now I know, ooh I know, how it goes
But I never understood

She's a wolf in sheeps' clothing, you know
And it's time to make her play
All the games she's been playing with you

Can't you see, she's just playing games
Her fantasy, she's just playing games

You started something
Or maybe you tried
But you had it coming
And I got you under my thumb
Starting something
I'll settle the score
I'm owing nothing
I'm out the door

You've got her on her knees and you know
You've got one thing that she needs
Should it be that she's losing control

Can't you see, she's just playing games
Her fantasy, she's just playing games
