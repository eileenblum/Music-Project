Lost in a dream
In a dream of you
All that's left is a tear
That I cried for you

When you held me in your arms
You made me feel just like a child
Safe from all harm

Once in love, now it's gone
And I stand alone
There's a place in my heart
You still have a home

And I'm holding onto dreams
And the memories of you
Haunting my soul

Never again will I wake and see you smile
Never again will I hold you
Never again, no more planning for tomorrow
Never again tells a story

It seems so, so long ago
When you held me near
I can't take all the pain
It's so hard to bear

Still I'm holding onto dreams
And the memories of you
Haunting my soul

Never again will I wake and see you smile
Never again will I hold you
Never again, no more planning for tomorrow
Never again tells the story

Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
