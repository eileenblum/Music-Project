Don't do it, cut through it
Keep your mind on the track
Or you know you're gonna screw it
Don't do it, get to it
There's a smile on her face
And you know that you can do it

After one, the playing's done
It's time to end the game
One more drink, you just might sink
Don't care about the name

Love toys
She's just another piece for the boys
Like an action set
Love toys, better roll the dice
Bad boys
Just playing a game

Don't do, hold to it
It's love on the rocks
One more shot is gonna do it
Don't do it, fight through it
It's that dog and a bone
Keep on trying, don't you lose it

After one, the playing's done
The time is getting near
One more drink, you just might sink
You just ain't thinking clear

Love toys
She's just another piece for the boys
Like an action set
Love toys, better roll the dice
Bad boys
Just playing

You hit the streets
You'll take what she's giving
Trashing the sheets
Now you're on your own

Don't do it, you blew it
Now the light's in her eyes
And you really want to lose it
Don't do it, you knew it
You could've bet the game would end like this

Night it comes, reloaded guns
You're ready for the same
A timely stare, you're almost there
The play begins again

Love toys
She's just another piece for the boys
Like an action set
Love toys, better roll the dice
Bad boys
Just playing Love toys
She's just another piece for the boys
Like an action set
Love toys, better roll the dice
Bad boys
Just playing
