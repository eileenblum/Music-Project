Come on, baby, give it to me
Magic lady, make me believe

You keep purring all night long
Keep it pushing all night long

Keep it tight
Till morning light

Come on mama, show me some tricks
Rock me, honey, you know the licks

Good girl, bad girl, all night long
Got me burning all night long

Do it right
Through the night

Keep it tight
Through the night
