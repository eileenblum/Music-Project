What's this in the mirror
Looking back at me
Reflections of a man
That I knew so long ago
Like a stranger in disguise
Could you be wrong
Thinking you knew me so well

Now you tell me, I'm no good
Take one long look in the mirror

I was once a man of dreams
That you destroyed
You took all I lived for
And you threw it all away
Now you're standing all alone
And no one cares
You should have known this before

You can't tell me I'm no good
Just look at yourself

Don't try to hide your face
Your past you can't erase
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall

Now the mirror's shattered
And it's clear to see
I'm still the man I was
Before you threw it all away
The mirror holds the past
And you can't break free
Now it is your turn to pay

Try and tell me I'm no good
Just look at yourself

Don't try to hide your face
Your past you can't erase
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
Mirror on the wall
