[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Someone calls me I'm wrong
Something tells me I'm wrong
Brother......
Everyone seems so right
Everything seems so bright
Mother.......
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I'm coming home
After the storm
I'm coming home
Everything has gone
I fed up everything
The words don't mean a thing
Brother......
Maybe I want to stay
Maybe I want to leave
Mother.......
Don't wanna leave it all behind
Don't wanna leave it all behind
I'm coming home
After the storm
I'm coming home
Everything has gone
Only one
Lonely one
Only one
I'm the chosen one..........
