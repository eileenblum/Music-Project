[Music: Hirotsugu Homma, Lyrics: Kayla Ritt]

Traveling through the world
With these gypsies
I sing to the crowds
Like a well oiled machine
I give to you
Ain't got a lot, but what I got
I save for you
It's an...
Ace in the hole
Ball in the glove
Arrow on the bullseye
I gotta whole lot of love
You go through the day
Paving your own way
your sisters and your brothers
end up back this way
Ain't got a lot, but what I got
I give to you
Ain't got a lot, but what I got
I save for you
As long as you will listen
A story I will tell
As long as your willing
My life won't be like hell
It's an...
Ace in the hole
Ball in the glove
Arrow on the bullseye
I gotta whole lot of love
