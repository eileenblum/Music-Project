[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Staring back at me and laughing
A mirror man I do not know
Staring back at me and laughing
Says your gonna sell your soul
I scream in twisted agony
Falling down to the floor
Is it dream orreality??
So I crawl right out the door
Under.... under, under the light
Fire, whisper, fire burns.....
Under.... under, under the light
Fire, whisper, fire burns.....
I can't go back and face it
Intruder in the glass
To chance another look again
Would scare me up the ass
Reaching for the whiskey bottle
I take it all at once
Burning in my eyeballs
Makes me puke up all my lunch
Under.... under, under the light
Fire, whisper, fire burns.....
Under.... under, under the light
Fire, whisper, fire burns..................
