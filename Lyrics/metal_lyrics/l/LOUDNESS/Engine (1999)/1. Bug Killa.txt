[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

They sting like bees, they crawl on my bed
Eggs are hatching I feel, scratching my feet
Got to get away get away, get away from here
Got to get away get away, get away from here
Bug bites.......... Stinging like bees
Bug bites.......... Creeping up my skin
Kill them all!!  kill them all!!
I am a bug killer, I am a bug patrol
come out and see me  come eat me alive
come out and see me  come eat me alive
hopeless disaster, save my life
bug bites.......... stinging like bees
bug bites.......... creeping up my skin
kill them all!!  kill them all!!  eat them all!!
they sting like bees
crawling on my bed
bug killer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
