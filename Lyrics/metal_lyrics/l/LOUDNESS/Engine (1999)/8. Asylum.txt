[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

The sun beats down like blood
Across the east desert land
True mess, the year 2005
Atomic bombs everywhere
Soldiers are marching across the screen......
Panic all around
Exploding sound
But no one hears my cries
One step ahead
One road ahead
I keep sliding back
We are the armed forces
We are the armed punks
Suck my metal ass!!
Searching for asylum
Searching for asylum, asylum!!
The moon is rising in the dark spooky sky
Black hell is wide open
I just can't open my eyes
Evening star lights
Shining above metal gun heads
Fading into the smoky clouds
Panic all around
Exploding sound
But no one hears my cries
One step ahead
One road ahead
I keep sliding back
We are the armed forces
We are the armed punks
Suck my metal ass!!
Searching for asylum
Searching for asylum, asylum!!
