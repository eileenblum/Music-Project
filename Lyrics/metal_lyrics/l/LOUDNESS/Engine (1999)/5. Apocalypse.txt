[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Get your last breath to Apocalypse
See the fire below
Rock and roll blasting Metropolis
Stand up and shout some more
Five more minutes left to survive
I wanna stay alive
Get your last breath to Apocalypse
See the fire below
Show me the way to get out of here
'Cause they've locked me up in this place
In the deep blue city light
I've lost my way  feeling like the living dead
Tell me the way to get out of here
'Cause they've locked it up in this place
I'm down here roaming gutters in the night
Escalator to heaven
Alligator city of the night
Searching for the way to Heaven's door
No one cares
Deeper down in the downtown soul
Deep inside
Should I stay, should I leave
Get me out 'cause I feel so stupid
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep your last breath to the golden years
Apocalypse!!!
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep your last breath to the golden years
Apocalypse!!!
