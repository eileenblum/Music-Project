[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Staring at the wall
Nothing better to do
Here is the song I wrote
I will sing for you
Staring at the sun
There's nothing new
Time is sweepin' away
Don't know what to do
Spring is coming soon
Summer is almost here
Feel the birth of trees
In colourful cream
Leave me alone
Maybe you can be my friend
Leave me alone
I don't wanna feel the end
Don't you bother try to change my world
Don't you think I will fly as a painted bird
Don't you bother try to change my world
Don't you think I will fly as a painted bird
