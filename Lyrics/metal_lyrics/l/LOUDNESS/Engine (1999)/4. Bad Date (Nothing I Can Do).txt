[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Cheating on my girl
I beep her after class
Meet me at the diner
Someone please cover my ass
Bad date
wasting my time
Nothing I can do about it
Bad taste
ruining my life
I wanna run and hide
I can win the Lotto
I'll be a millionaire
My life is just a gamble
I've got to take it slower
Bad date
wasting my time
Nothing I can do about it
Bad taste
ruining my life
I wanna run and hide
Where's my money
Begging all my life
Where's my money
Begging all my life
who in the hell knows
no no no
