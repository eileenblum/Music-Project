[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Got no eyes
Got no brain
Tattoo the skin
Tattoo the sky
Deja vu.......... is this taboo?
You got me crazy, dirty minds
Get a grip babe
That is all in my mind
Get it quick babe
My rattle snake shakin' down the valley of queen... Hey!!
Mouth full of lies
Mouth full of spit
Tattoo the skin
Tattoo the sky
Deja vu.......... is this taboo?
I lie again, again, and again....
Get a grip babe
That is all in my mind
Get it quick babe
My rattle snake shakin' down the valley of queen
Get a grip babe!!
Get it quick babe!!
All your lies
All your greed
Rotting on your face
All your lies
All your greed
Rotting on your face......
Rotting on your face......
