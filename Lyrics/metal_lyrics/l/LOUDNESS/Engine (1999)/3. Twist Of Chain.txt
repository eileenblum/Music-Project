[Music: Akira Takasaki, Lyrics: Masaki Yamada]

Do I have to give up all my life?
Do I have to care about someone else?
Do I feel, do I need, do I see in your eyes?
Do I get to tell you what I really need?
Do I have to give up all my life?
Do I feel, do I need, do I see in your eyes?
Break this twist of chain
In the driving rain
Watch the sun goes down
Shake the hands of fate
In crying rain..........
Open up your eyes
Don't be so afraid
Open up the skies
When I'm calling out your name
Twist of chain....
Break this twist of chain..........
