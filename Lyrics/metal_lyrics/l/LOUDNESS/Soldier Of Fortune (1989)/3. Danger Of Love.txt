You live the life of a stranger
You try to hide from yourself
But now you're living in danger
Of loving somebody else

In the broken silence of your cries
You make it easy to see
Like a prisoner lost in your disguise
And that's why you'll always be...

(Pain)  Pay for your pleasure, look out
The danger of love
(Pain)  Pay for the danger, look out
It's the danger of love

Nobody knows you've got troubles
That's why you came to this place
And this masquerade is just your way
Of hiding tears on your face

Before you let things go too far
You've got to tear down the wall
And the mask I see is telling me
You ran away from it all...

(Pain) Closer to danger, look out
The danger of love
(Pain) Stranger in danger, look out
Yeah, the danger of love
(Pain) Pays for the pleasure, look out
It's the danger of love
(Pain) Pay for the danger, look out
The danger of love
