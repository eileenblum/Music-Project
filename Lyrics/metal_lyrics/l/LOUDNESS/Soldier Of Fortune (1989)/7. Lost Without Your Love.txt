Run from the night, your blind love is burnin'
Through your eyes, my empty world is turning
Without you now, tell me how to just let you go
I'm a victim of your touch, your fire
You burn me deep inside

Wild wind carry me away
Out on my own, crying in the rain

Gave me no warning, cold winds are blowin'
I'm so lost without your love
Gave me no warning, cool fire, lost emotion
I'm so lost without your love

[Solo]

Lost in a dream, the wild wind is calling
I can't get free, my soul forever falling
Alone in your love, shattered love, crying in the rain
Now I'm dancing in the shadow of love, oh yeah
Voices screaming in the dark
I'm all alone, stranger on the run

[Repeat chorus]
