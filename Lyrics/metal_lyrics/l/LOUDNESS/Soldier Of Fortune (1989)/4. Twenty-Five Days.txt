I've been searching through this heart of mine
Feeling captured by a world of changes
Silent pictures in the course of time
Lead me gently through the open pages

How long can we keep holding on
Are we only a step away
What's left when all the hope is gone
Leaving only the pain - deep inside

I remember how it used to be
Long before we felt the hand of sorrow
Holding traces of a memory
On empty pages where there's no tomorrow

How long can we keep holding on
Are we only a step away
What's left when all the hope is gone
Leaving only the pain - deep inside

[Chorus:]
Now I can't believe you left me just
Twenty-five days from home
You've taken my dreams
And left me just twenty-five days from home
Now I can't explain
Nothing's the same without your love
Twenty-five days from home
No, I can't believe I'm alone
Twenty-five days from home

[Solo]

[Chorus]
