Fading lights, broken hearts, I left them all behind
Turned to stone, I chose to roam the wild land
Broken dreams and pools of tears, there's nothing left it seems
Came the night to see my life unfold

[Chorus:]
I see the faces in the fire, still burning
I feel the hunger of the flame of love, and it's reaching to me
I see the faces in the fire, and I'm learning
I'm just a fool in Paradise, and I'll never get free.

I turned away so long ago, looking for the change
My promises, they rode upon the wild wind
Came the night the air was cold, a flood of memories
Coming back to haunt my empty soul

[Chorus]

Faces in the fire....

[Solo]

[Chorus]
