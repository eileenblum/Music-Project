I can feel her touch from far away
That woman don't have to say
Hey baby it's time, it's you I want tonight
I love her walk, the way she moves
She drinks my blood 'til I come unglued
She's so tough, but she's smooth, baby, smooth on the edge

Find a way to make her mine
Find a way to cross the line
Take in my arms and make believe
Tell you how she'll never let me leave

[Chorus 1:]
Long after midnight
She'll be comin', a ghost in the moonlight
Long after midnight
My body's frozen, she's comin' for me tonight

She's a fantasy, a question mark
No way to hold her beyond the dark
A mystery, burning me, shadow in my heart.

Find a way beyond the dream
Find a way to stop the scream
Takin' all I got, you make me feel
The poison deep inside is finally real, yeah

[Chorus 2:]
Long after midnight
Now I feel her draggin' from the light
Long after midnight
Now I touch her, there's no escape

When the candle burns beyond the night
And I stand on my own
Shattered dream of morning, shade the light
And I'm never alone, she never lets go

[Solo]

[End chorus:]
Long after midnight
Comin' for you, screamin' into the night
Long after midnight
You can touch me, feel the thrill of my bite
Long after midnight
Now you feel me draggin' ya from the light
Long after midnight
Now I'm comin' for you, fear is the key tonight
Long after midnight
She's coming for you tonight
Long after midnight
Ghost of the blackest night, runnin' in fear...
