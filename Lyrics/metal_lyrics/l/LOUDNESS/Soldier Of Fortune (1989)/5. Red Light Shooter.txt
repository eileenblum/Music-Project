Breakin' the law, takin' my chances
Ain't gonna drag me down
Midnight cruiser in a black sedan
I'm gonna shake this town.

I'm a red light shooter, win or loser
And when I come around
Take it, I'm ready, movin' hot n' steady
When the sun goes down.

Over and over
Wondering who it'll be
Over and over
This time - there's no stopping me

[Chorus:]
Red light shooter, I'm a win or loser
Red light shooter
Reaching out in desperation
Red light shooter, I'm a win or loser
Red light shooter
Turning on to your temptation
Over and over again...

Takin' a shot, showin' no mercy
I got my eye on you
Take me undercover like a hungry lover
And do me like you do

Over and over
Wondering how it could be
Over and over
Your eyes are all I can see.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
