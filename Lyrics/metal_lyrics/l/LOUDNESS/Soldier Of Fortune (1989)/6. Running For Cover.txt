Gimme shelter, cold was the night, fires burn deep in the sky.
I been trying so hard just to weather the storm in your eyes
Like a stranger, fire and ice, diamonds that shine in the dark
You look, but don't touch, oh I want her so much
She says burn.

Take no prisoner, steal your soul
Give you no quarter, and never let go
All through the night, she's tempting your fate
Gives you no choice, you can't hesitate

[Chorus:]
Running for cover, run for your life
Running for cover, you got no place to hide
Running for cover, do it or die
Running for cover, you'd better run for your life

Heartbreaker, never look back,
Run from the sounds of her love
So cold like the steel on a blade
Cutting straight through my heart.

Take no prisoner, steal your soul
Give me no quarter, and never let go
All through the night, still tempting my fate
Gave me no choice, I can't hesitate

[Chorus 2:]
Running for cover, run for your life
Running for cover, you got no place to hide
Running for cover, run for your life
Running for cover, oh you do it or die

[Solo]

Take no prisoner, steal my soul
Give me no quarter, and never let go
All through the night, just tempting my fate
Gives me no choice, I can't hesitate

[Chorus 3:]
Running for cover, run for your life
Running for cover, you do it or die
Running for cover, no place to hide
Running for cover, oh you do it or die
