Rebel young, tracks to burn
We take the glory, we belong
Through the light of a million eyes, we know (move)
With steel and fire, break the chain
Live in the heart of a hurricane
This innocent child is no more

Together, forever, oh, let's rock the earth
Oh, can't hold back - no more

[Chorus:]
Soldier of Fortune, giving you no warning
The whole world's watching, let it rock
Soldier of fortune, burning up the torches
We are the Rebels, let it rock!

In the streets, broken dreams
Don't matter, we'll find the means
Fighting to win, never look down

I need it, I feel it - the heat of a million eyes
Oh, lift me up, beyond the stars...

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
