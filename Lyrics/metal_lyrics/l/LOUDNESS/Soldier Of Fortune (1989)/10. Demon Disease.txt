We are the chosen, the keepers of all we know
We are the future of all we believe
We are the children who reached for the open door
But all we found was the Demon Disease

Where can we go from the terror within
We must be guilty if love is a sin...
How can we live in the face of a lie
The race is on, now it's your turn to cry

[Chorus:]
From the fathers to sons, our dreams will carry on
And the powers to be will fight for you and me...
Demon Disease...

We live the life of illusions and fantasy
Sometimes it's harder to take than to give
And as we opened the door to reality
We saw the demon who's dying to live

How can we run when there's nowhere to hide
I'm not a stranger with no one to ride
Is there a chance for the young to be old?
The heat is on but we're out in the cold

[Chorus]

[Solo]

How can we run when there's nowhere to hide
I'm not a stranger with no one to ride
Is there a chance for the young to be old
The heat is on but we're out in the cold

[Chorus]
