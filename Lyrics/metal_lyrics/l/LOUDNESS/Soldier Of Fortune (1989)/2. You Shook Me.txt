Tonight's the night I'm breaking out
I gotta know what it's all about
Hey babe, there ain't no way I'm gonna lose you
I got your love in my blood tonight
And I'm so far gone I can't see the light
Oh yeah, the pressure's on and I'm cruisin'

Baby, take me back where I belong
Take me back before the night is gone
No I can't escape the thunder
Of your burning wings of love
Take me down and love me baby, slow and easy

You shook me, shook me all night long
You shook me, shook me all night long
You shook me, shook me all night long
You shook me, shook me all night...

Startin' out, I'm bearin' down
You've got me burning at the speed of sound
Oh, and I'm comin' to get ya
Ain't nothin' gonna stop me now
If ya can't get loose, I can show you how
I'm gonna hold you tight
'Cause I can still remember

Baby take me back where I belong
Take me back before the thrill is gone
I've been on the road of lightning
With a circuit overload
Take me back and love me baby, oh so easy

You shook me, shook me all night long
You shook me, shook me all night long
(All night) Baby, you've been burnin' into me
(All night long) Since you walked into my day

[Solo]

You shook me, yeah you shook me all night long
You shook me, and you shook me on and on and on
(All night) Baby step into my lovin' arms
(All night long) 'Cause you need to feel my charms around you
