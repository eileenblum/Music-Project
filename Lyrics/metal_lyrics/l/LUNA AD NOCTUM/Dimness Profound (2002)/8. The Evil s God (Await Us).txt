You always welcome
Everyone
Who summons demons from your distant kingdom
You never requested
Never refused
Always on your evil's throne
But now you must await us cause we're summoning you
You are the only one who is our unholy leader
Now in your magic circle every man is overcome by dark
Mesmerise
Damned by heaven
They are under protection of thy evil's ogares
And tonight if it's fullmoon
We're going to meet every one
Once again
...you promise the side of immortal
The land without fear
Hesitation of hereafter
Insuperable lucid dreams
You've promised the side of immortal
The land without decease
Magnificent, unsung feeling we've passed
To the kingdom of devil in
...now we scream
Await us forevermore
