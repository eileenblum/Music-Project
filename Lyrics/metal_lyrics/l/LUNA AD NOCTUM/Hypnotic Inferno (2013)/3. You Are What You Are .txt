We are the present living
We're the dead without redemption
We're self-infected wounds
We are the faithless doom
We're poisoned flesh 
We're sovereign but fallen
We're scorched but nothingness
We're light of every fucken lie

We're shadow of god and faith
We're virus and infection
We're raped by anger and hate
We're infernal sacrifice on earth

We're inception of every disease
We're hell/heaven without reason
We're devotion since the ancient times
We're plague of ruined future
We're feeding by human blood

We're marching towards nowhere
We're in delirious night
We're invented by un/holy father
We're his madness dark
We're punishment to heaven
We're red exhale of hell
We born in blood and live in pain
We die alone insane

We are what we are
