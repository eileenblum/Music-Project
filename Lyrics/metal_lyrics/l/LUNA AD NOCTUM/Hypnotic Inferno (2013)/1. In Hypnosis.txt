There upon my dream
Prevails the garden of relief
To believe is to see
And seeing is not to believe

Nothingness all I feel
Anger drives my fist
Empty soul
Pushed in different skin
Flesh so shaking still

Tears tonight red as sky
In deadly trap I watch myself gone blind
Much far than in worst imagination

Crack on the mirror
Body divides in two halves
Near miss to the early grave
High pressure flows through my veins

In this space there is no more demand only peace in rest
Night is reality
Heaven stressing me

Heart beating push out my chest inside
Turns to ash in so prosaic way...
This effect happening last beyond real world
Where sleeping is reality not to reveal

Fear of madness drenching me
Vision of loneliness in hypnosis
Yes, visual effects refresh my physical energy
Swallowed drug in rush
Clinical metamorphosis

Crack on the mirror
Body divides in two halves
Near miss to the early grave
High pressure flows through my veins

In this space there is no more demand only peace in rest
Night is reality
Heaven stressing me
