Heart biting noiseless void
Become the shadow sworn
Opium as the final option
The angel with black wings embraces me...

And my whispers hang on the wind
And projections born under the spell blow
One step forward into cold abyss
Where the beauty and horror dwell

No need the ecstasy just nightmare gone
When darkness touches my face
Winter air frost down on my feet
Tortures begun stopping the time

Reason of suffering existing
Deep inside my soul
Once in one fall time
No end just straight to the hell
And by body dimmed 6 feet under
My tears fall in thickening smoke
My beast overcome my entire love
Suffocate my feeling for good...

In this, decoy at the first kiss from the death?
In this, exploding temptation cause Luna shown her face?
In this, emotion supports the opium inhale?
To proceed the one cold hypnosis deep in winter dream...

Still I wander wear the armor of fear
I hold the candle reminding me my presence right now right here
And my rotten soul seems to be parallel with the vision I see
And my rotting soul bound to the pledge of suffering
And now I stare of Geminids falling down the sky...
Faith resistant, stuck among my spirit &amp; flesh
