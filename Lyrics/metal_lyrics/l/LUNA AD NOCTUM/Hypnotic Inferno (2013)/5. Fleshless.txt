I believe these visions full of power and magic
I believe in dream's phantom secret flames
I believe these visions spiritual reflection
I believe in nightfall brings all devils to me

It's risen like force out of my flesh
Ineffable darkness and hate in itself

This ritual keeps all evil slumbering for a while
Suspending my senses while such glorious time

Sensible light touching my eyes
Bitter sky full of moonrise
Enchant me so much

Torn apart my soul
Cold my face
Warm my heart
I can feel salty tongue
Nestled viper in my arms
Noxious
So deceived price
For this mysterious paradise

Astral movement keeps me going down
Venom released to the flesh
Full granted poison towards down my veins
Letting myself trespass
Fleshless terminal phase
