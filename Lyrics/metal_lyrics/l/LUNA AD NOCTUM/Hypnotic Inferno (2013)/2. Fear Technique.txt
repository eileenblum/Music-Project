Thus (my) kingdom is to come
In my dreams widely scattered
Inside of hollow sleep disorder
Lethargic
Breathless
Mesmerizing
Shuttered

Fear of the night
Red lucid pills
Promise me to obey artificial light
Slumber tortures close my tired eyes
Feel just nothing ain't uttermost relax

Nerves synapse mental slave
Liquid stains falls down of my face
No more shining from within
Heart putrefied instantly

Cold emotion chaos distress
I can't sleep, silence is my grave...

Hypnotic Inferno
Hypnosis in fear

No resist I shall feel
Of dream comes even for a while
New dawn rises before I paint my vision bright
Crimson sky slain me just the same as dusk
Cosmic hallucination
Astral ocean emptiness
Left in nowhere
Darkness get its sense
I speak all the tongues in my slumber state
Bring me sleep
Please
Just release
Just relief...
