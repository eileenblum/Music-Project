I'm dead inside
Pretend to live
A real life
I'm dead inside

Leave me behind
Dispose of me
This is my doom
Martyrium

Another day comes to unveil
The world that has died, died in my eyes
Built of grey stone tall stand my walls
To save me from... my other self

I'm dead inside
Pretend to live
A real life
I'm dead inside

Leave me behind
Dispose of me
This is my doom
Martyrium

In through my veins run toxic pain
The pain that I try to ease everyday
In my scarred head a battlefield
I'm not dead yet but willing to cease
To exist no more

Oh, how many times I have wished
That I had never been born
How many times I have wished
That the world (we know) would burn
And how many times I have not lived before?

My world has died
Death feeds on its corpse
Over the carrion
Black ravens croak
