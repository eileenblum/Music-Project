Ocean breeze I shall smell
Heaven stars hit the water surface
How slow is the way to pass by the hole in the sky
Through my visions secret doors
Through my empty eyes
Anyway
Would you promise me to fly away up there?
Now or never...

Where I go no one say...
Darkness sure I obey everywhere
Scent of rain liberates me
Shadow cold
My breath is deep

Take a look I can find myself so easy
In this sublime ether pattern
But for short period of time
Pain is temporary blocked
Taken off so away

Reversible lack of awareness
Decreased my stress response
In dark motion I progress
My eyes white
Mouth wide open
Considerable pain is back
Shall not be ever explained?

Slowly, strained, but stand still
Headache cometh blows my nerves
I can't abide by the pain inside
While on my way back to life
I don't want it!
