Out there 
Wind still blows
Snow still falls
Sun still shines
Moon still blinds

I
Half man half flame
In never-ending thoughts dark fluid
Hypnotic grief cursed in nighttime
Affects my anxiety and pain

This drugs flash relief
My urge for sleep
Here and everywhere winter never ends...

3 hours stand still here alone
Drug, the sleepless nightmare
Just because of therapeutic sedative reasons

Dark magic hidden within my head
Long fatal doze worsening sleep

Zaleplon the reason of hallucination
Indicates some meaningless random dreams
Serves me double visions and abnormal pain
With first lunation in this year...

Horrible vengeance upon me
Darkness rising might
Like a claw twisted round my throat
Ambushed whilst the night

Ånie!
IleÅ¼ razy westchnÄ do ciebie, gdy jasna
Okrutna prawda mÃ³zg mÃ³j I serce rozdziera
Jesczcze godzina jedna, dwie â a potem zasnÄ
I cichoÅÄ mnie Åmiertelna koÅysze
Duch we mnie umiera

Out there 
Wind still blows
Snow still falls
Sun still shines
Moon still blinds
