And Mars comes on the Saturn's path
So alone, disturb
Venus stands still alone
Like sin in peculiar way committed
An impulse sent towards the cosmos from me
As instance of love in current times
Where no one's being held behind anymore

To the moon I whisper to separate Venus Saturn Mars
If stars were closer I would prey just one
Lust for her lights much more than your skin tonight
Regardless of insomniac sleepless empty nights
Where nothing's being held behind anymore

This remote lights of my personal harbour I shall never get
Force to have and to hold this paradise
Empire of falling sands
Rotten walls
Dead inside

Smell the cold aura of immortal fog
The haze obstructs the Lunar lights
Machinery of human thoughts starts to fly
In gravity of mega darkness forever last

Portal of hope open to pass
In range no sounds no voice no fear no words
Let's go through by unseen line
Speak as loud with open shallow eyes
Dawn hits early dawn while I finally passed
I'm awaken
