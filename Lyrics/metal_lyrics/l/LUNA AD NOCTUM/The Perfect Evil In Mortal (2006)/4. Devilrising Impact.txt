Find me here trapped in a dream
Awake till the blue twilight comes
My love is in here the secret of hope, wishes and harmony with universe...
... And then You can call me heaven and hell

Call me heaven, call me hell over again !

There is no flesh my naked ghost awakes
Black mark on my soul
Hellbound, bizarre, devoted, agonized...

The glass cage cuts up my hide
Slow poison mixing inside
And dreams have died along this way...

The wind is blowing strong
Enlight my wounds with healing tongue
I summon the night temple of emerging darkness depth
Through the passage of border between life and death...

The winter is gone I'm lost in demons breeding fog
... I'm lost in demonrising fog and wind is blowing strong

The glass cage cuts up my hide
Slow poison mixing inside
And dreams have died along this way
Devil rising up inside me yet again
Hellbound, bizarre, devoted, agonized...

You can call me heaven, call me hell...
