Once I shared with you my wisdom, yet you spat in my face
Turned your back on me, flock with the feeble race
You chose to betray, break out of my embrace
My black pearl you once were, now not a trace

Fruit of my dreams blossoms and screams,
Entangles my soul as I savour your tears
Sour taste of despair, life long past repair
Ecstatic, at last I feast upon your fear

We drank from the same chalice once, no words of sorrow
Yet you chose to leave my human casket hollow
Chose deceiver's path, thought my blackened heart would follow
Now on your own grieve you choke, then swallow

Fruit of my dreams blossoms and screams,
Entangles my soul as I savour your tears
Sour taste of despair, life long past repair
Ecstatic, at last I feast upon your fear

And from pleasure's chalice you rejected, I take a sip
While your god does nothing, nothing else but weep

Of darkest vengeance accomplished quest
As I lay your open heart to rest
Where pain and pleasure melt as one
Nourish your wreck with my sinful cum
