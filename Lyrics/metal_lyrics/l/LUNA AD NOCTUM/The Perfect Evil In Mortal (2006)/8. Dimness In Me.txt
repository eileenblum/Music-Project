Hidden in shadows of broken destination
My soul yells for the final consolation
Where words are needless silence is frequent
Like my constant erection...

I beg for further attractions
To improve my sexual fantasy
Oh you poor tiny girl
I want You to piss on my naked breast
You're the bitch I hate but wanna fuck !
Or even watch fingering at night! ...
Now preparing for full Moon to come
Whilst Dimness comes into Dark...

... If only I could have turned back that time

I would have surely run away before You left me to rot
In front of Your frozen heart
Now You're asking me why I cry so loud?
Can't You see? I'm fighting right now
In the middle of everlasting war!
Deprave Yourself it's better than You suppose
I'll shed my skin to let You touch my bones
And push Your eyes inside Your head
I don't care if You suffer till the end
Relax Yourself it's easier than You suppose
I'll shed my skin to let You suck my balls
And push Your eyes inside Your face
I don't care if You suffer till erase... till death

I die for my own sins
Not for Yours anymore!
It's cold...
I used to suffer from Your coldness
But not anymore... Definitely not!

Krew na skÃ³rze
Spekane dziury niczym aktywne stygmaty
Obdarty ze skÃ³ry z nadzieja konca dnia
W pÃ³lmroku opatrze swe rany
Obdarty ze skÃ³ry z nadzieja koá¹ca dnia
W pÃ³lmroku przeczekam swa á¹¡mierÄ...
