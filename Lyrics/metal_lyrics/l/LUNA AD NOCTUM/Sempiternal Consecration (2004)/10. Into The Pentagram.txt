Prisoner of my dreams
Slave to my illusions
Paralysed by the anguish of a new day
Tormented by the desire of glory
The thirst for power

I'm refuging into the pentagram
Where I fear nobody
I dominate my enemies
I lead my friends
All belongs to me, body and soul

Prisoner of my dreams
Slave to my illusions
Paralysed by the anguish of a new day
Tormented by the desire of glory
The thirst for power

I'm retreating into the pentagram
Where I become possessor of your lives
Dictator of your thoughts
Master of your acts
The pentagram is my invincible weapon...
