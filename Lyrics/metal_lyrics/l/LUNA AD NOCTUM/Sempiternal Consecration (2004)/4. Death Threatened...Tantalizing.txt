So far from consciousness
I remind myself ensnared
By dreams suffocated - considering my to decline
Despair inquisition for being part of murderous lust
I kneel to be led till I reach inevitable death
Let I speak and fell seeing distance I've pussed
So near so fast premonition indeed
Conjured seriously in madness
Darkness fulfilled within...
Sunrise I missed I do not care anymore
I cannot put up my burden of life
What is struggle when soul's torn apart?
Infinity is virginity
Mortality invalidity
...Seeing distance I've passed
So near so fast premonition indeed
Conjured seriously in madness
Darkness fulfilled within
...I came back from mortal zone
My ash to fire again
Life ember's flickering so weak
Across the sand of desert
Towards the wideness of frozen mountains
So wild distance my heart shrines in depth
Need to feel so free but death is tantalizing for me
My ashes from fire again betweem my bare fingers
Are being blown out from my hands...
Infinity is virginity mortality - invalidity
