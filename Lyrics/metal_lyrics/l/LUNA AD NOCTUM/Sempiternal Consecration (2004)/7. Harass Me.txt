The scent of woman's flesh
In the grave of my soul I can Smell
Lust &amp; death
Your body still warm
The hole still wet
The light is gone
For she has died
Desire's undone
Dark in her eyes
So fresh are the memories
Of our lechrous days
The demons tempt me to join her
To reunite in death's embrace
Visit me
In my sleep
Molest me
Harass me!
Through she is dead I crave for her touch
Obsessed with her sight
I pray to the Devil to send me her back
I have become victimize by a woman antichrist
Kiss me deep with Your numb lips
Drink my blood, make me come
Arouse me, harass me!
Make me fuck with Your fucken cold cunt!
