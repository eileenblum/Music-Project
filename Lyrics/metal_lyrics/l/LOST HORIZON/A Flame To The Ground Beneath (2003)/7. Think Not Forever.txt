[Music: Martin Furangen / Wojtek Lisicki]
[Lyrics: Maritn Furangen]

Waking up from a nameless decay
My life was is dream and my faith was in chains
Hypocrites kept me blind, still the Force is mine

Would it be in my heart to efface
Emotions for flesh and to stay out of doctrines' range
I am caught in a veil of illusions that haze my sight

If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide

[Solo: Trascendental Protagonist]

Evolution in mind, heart and soul
Has brought me to see and to reach to my virgin glow
I have changed how to be, but it still is me

There is no one to stop my every strife
And all of my dreams now can be lived in life
I have learned how to see and believe in me, all time

If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide
