[Music &amp; Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

Voices like wind...
Wordless their whispers...
I hear them!
Wandering alone, strayed form the path
Lost in the gales of despair

I see the shades wasting their last dreams
Hiding their woes... just for themselves
Only with fear as remains

Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn

Strain in the air...
Like crystal bells...
Now listen!
Deep in your mind search once again
Magical essence is there!

I brought my flame back from the shadows
Lost in the cold darks of this world
Will is the power I hail!

Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn

[Solo: Trascendental Protagonist]
