[Music &amp; Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

[Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius]

Down in the ashes wounded I crawl
Pray shall I not - god is gone
Lonely, but mighty, insight's my home
Into that shine now and again I will go

Stars gleam on my way, darkness chants for me
Into the depth I can see
Frozen, but conscious, spirit is my warmth
Wings of true will are carrying me through this world

But the world still is drowned in ecstasy
Of the fate and the myth of gods
But I doubt there's a journey planned for me
As I own every moment of my life
And the blessed they shall call it blasphemy
But I know what I think is right
Still the sun and the stars whill shine for me
For the pure I will fight
For no king I will die
For my thoughts I will live

Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!

Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me

[Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius]

For the mind of the world I share my eyes
Truths' arms embrace these words
All the ones who lost their hope
Look deep in your ego - you'll find it there!
For the mind of the world
I share my breath
In mystic empathy
From the awe I healed my heart
And now as I tell this
I don't fear no more!

Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!

Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me
