[Music &amp; Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

Hail to thee, Oh force of will
For awakening minds!
There for me from earliest days
Made this tale so mine

Storm...you almighty, earth, seas and flames
Here I am standing
Bare in my honesty
Calm in the moonshine
Starlight rests my eyes
Pain wakes me conscious
Truth guides my mind

Shine in my heart... strange colours embracing me
I'm not alone in a way
Wrath in my depths brings me to see I'm a warrior soul

Tortured minds... like a cloud they swarm around me
If I said my soul is screaming - would you believe in me!
Secret cry... hear the souls there howling, howling
While their salvation is so near

Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Grief is nothing life should be
Never bend for misery!
Always standing
Always searching
Always free

Will is the power!

Strayed spirits before me, I see flames still burning
Hearts wounded, transformed
Yet not into grey, cold stones

Innocent days, life full of breath
That is the time I am crying for
Fly free again through virgin lands
That is the life I will fight for to regain

Turn around! All the founts you'll find behind you
If I said my heart is burning - would you believe in me!
Years flow by, still you drown is caustic memories
Embrace the best and face old grief

Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Searching for a true relief
Finding life will be your first
Last one'll be your death

Cry of a restless soul

[Solo: Transcendental Protagonist]
[Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius]

Hunting breeze of wasted bliss I am
For me and you I will catch it
In the dusk of banished mist you'll hear a waning moan

Cry of a restless soul
