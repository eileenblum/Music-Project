Out of the sun, out of the night
Comes the morning light
Just another day breaks
Under the same sky
As the misty dawning fades away to its lair
Silence and peace fills the air
While this placid day reflects its calm
Feeling the chill of a distant zone
Hear the lost ones' cry from miles away
Wishing they were gone to another day
But the wishes give no hide
And the beasts you dread dwells in disguise

As the smoke covers my eyes
Mystic sight reveals
A doleful land among the shadows
Where only lost men go
Struggling in the night
Grief I see in their eyes

The sun is blackened while they fight
But the fire of hatred's rising high
The commands were only lies
Around me young men die

Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!

What about the life...
that shined so bright once in your eyes?
What about the death... faith you lost...
so that was your quest?
What about the dreams...
there where no visions in your grief?
What about the fight...
that graced your life?

Water, fire, wind and soil
My soul came to be reborn
As the lightning thrashes black skies
The spirit fills my mind

Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!

What about the life...
It shines so bright now in my eyes!
What about the death...
Faith I found, now life's my quest!
What about the dreams...
There're new visions in my grief!
What about the fight...
It graces my life!

Out of the fire
Out of the wind
Out of the water and soil
I'm reborn
