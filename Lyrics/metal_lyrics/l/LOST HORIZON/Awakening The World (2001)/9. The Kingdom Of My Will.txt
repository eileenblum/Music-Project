Riding from wastelands
Black were their skies
My armour's still bleeding
Ripped by fire and ice

Watch the horseman wing out of the night
He's coming to save you, prepare! For now he arrives

Mounting through stormlands
With the wind in my hair
The spell I've broken...
...like the chains of despair

Share this flame that guides me in the dark
The spirit of metal, the legacy of our kind

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Eyes of faith for me to see
The rotten deeds of liars
World that've turned to misery I brave
And the pure shall prevail

The misery I brave! Hey!
Led by that golden voice

Slaves of corruption
You'll fall by my hand
And all mindoppressors
Will be chased to the end

Fear the steel that's meant for all you rats!
The essence of insight, the truth,
that longs for your heads

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills my desolate shell

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Forced to yield the hypocrites
But orders I'll not follow
Worms of lie surrounding me
Now see my wings of war!
The battle's confronting me
And for me... the battle has started again

Now see!

If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!

Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!

Hey! You!

Hey!
If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills the chambers of my heart
