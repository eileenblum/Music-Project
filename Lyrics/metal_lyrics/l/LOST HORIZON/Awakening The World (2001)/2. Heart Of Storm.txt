Rising from the ruins
Yet my mind is burning
Flames reflect those years of torment
Life that drowned in fire
Death was my desire
Path of hate was a relief for me

And then we stood there eye to eye
The darkest grief against a pure heart
Life baptised in metal By the secret of steel you are blessed, hail!!!
Gift of power helps you vanquish All the mortal's plagues

Heart of storm - I feel... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - deep inside of me
Heart of storm - and when I tear all roots of pain,
Heart of storm - grief and agony, then I'll be free

Hey! Ride on the wind!

Lightning pierced my body
Back again I'm rising
Now you hear my primal calling
Shout out even higher
War's now our revival!
Voice of truth is cryin' out for me

And now we're standing side by side
The tamed old hatreds next to mine
Watch me ride on the thunder
Followed by the warriors of steel, hail!!!
Strive for justice, fight for freedom
Yeah! This war is real!

Heart of storm - I know... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - all inside of me
Heart of storm - and now I kill all grief and pain
Heart of storm - Hey! And I kill the misery!

Now the force is clean again
All inside of me
And as I've killed all grief and pain
I crushed the agony, and now I'm free

And my heart of storm

I know... I know everything
I am everything
I'm alive
