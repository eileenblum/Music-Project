Tribunal of senseless rabble
Built on fear and congruous prophecies
Twisting minds with planned hypocrisy
By the fools the clear're surrounded
Blind are deaf and deaf are blinded
Grant themselves the dream of destiny

Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force

Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

Clouds of might eclipse the horizon
Darkened sky as long as eye can see
Winds arise in wrath released by me
Now I spread the wings of fire
Flames of rage arise in power
The time has come to shed my burning will

Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force

Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
