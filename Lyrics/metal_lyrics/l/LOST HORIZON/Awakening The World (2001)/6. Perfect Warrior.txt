I was falling into the boundless sea
I'm the sacred one who chose to change this world
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Raise your sword and never fall again

I was calling, world never answered me
Time was standing still and life plunged into ruin
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Hold your head up high and spread your words

Mob of "right", I despise your way of life!
I'm a "sinner", yet forgive me nothing
I'm a "heathen", but forever free

Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you dare to watch my dreams
You'll forever bare your blame
In the name of pain

Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you try to steal my dreams
You will never free your name
From the chains of pain

If you try to break my wings
If you dare to touch my dreams
Then my curse will be your pain
