In typical fashion, you were confused.You were sorry when you
realized that you fucked up, but I expected that.In typical fashion,
everything dies and gets swept away.The people that we put high up on 
pedestals crumble like statues. You'd be crazy if you ever thought they 
wouldn't. You'd be a fucking dreamer.
