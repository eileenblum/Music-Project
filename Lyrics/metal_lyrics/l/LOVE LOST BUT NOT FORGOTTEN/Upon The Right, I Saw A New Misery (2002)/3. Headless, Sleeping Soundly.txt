Drag a chair across the floor.Scratch your name into the wood above
my door.You really gave it your all, buy you're finishedhere.You are
finished here! I say to myself.I color like a virus.It's so fucking 
unhealthy. Wrapped up so cozy I could easily go unaware.When I open 
up I spill over and over and over.My eyes burn like sores so I keep 
them closed whenever I can.
