I feel you tasting me, but I wear it with dignity.I feel you tasting
me up to my eyes.On my skin, I can smell the saliva of shitheads.It
stains yellow and smells like dog food.I need a place to puke.A way
to fall out of my skin.I just don't have enough skin.I need to fight 
you back.I need to feel okay.I need someone to put me away.Jesus Christ, 
I hope you swallow your tongue.I hope you swallow your tongue.
