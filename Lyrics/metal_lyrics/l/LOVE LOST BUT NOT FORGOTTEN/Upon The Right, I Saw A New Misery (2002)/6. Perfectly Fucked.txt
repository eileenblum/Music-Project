When I sit perfectly fixed and perfectly still, my mind is still walking
and beating.Can it be perfectly fixed and perfectly still? I think I
have finally found my devil, I know him.He's walking and beating.I'm 
not surprised at all.But at least now I know.At least now I know.I know
not to try very hard.Don't think I'm ever more than half serious.Even
when I'm passionate it's unimpressive.
