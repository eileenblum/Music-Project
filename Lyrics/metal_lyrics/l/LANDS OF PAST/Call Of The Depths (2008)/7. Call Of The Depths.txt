Sheâs so lost, see how she falls in her carnal cage
The ground beneath her cold skin just call the wings of silence
Scream, weep, fear the voices within, the voices calling the essence of her own

Become the void, and follow me
follow as an asphodel that beg the dawn fade alone

Fade and cry, fade and die

she is far, she seems so cold in her carnal cage an eerie silence... as a graveâ¦ as a grave
and voicesâ¦ and voices as a torn veil

Sink in yourself, bring these mortal depths that scream
