Old times will never come back (will never come)
Dreams are our only real life on earth

Look at your life and tell me
I canât understand life
Why was I born in these times for one life
Take my hands in yours, I can offer you all what you want
all what you dream of
Death is a cruel gate which sweep the past
Look at your life and tell me
Iâm afraid of this world
(But) how can I choose a neverending life
Choose my road, eternal life, or forever fade
