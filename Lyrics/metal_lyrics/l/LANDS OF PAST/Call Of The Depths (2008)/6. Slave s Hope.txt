But you trusted again in his name,
You believed that wasnât insane
And lost in the labyrinth of your own will
You will claim the right to be free!

And no name for the man whoâs different
No grace for the child in his veins
And lost in the haze of what he doesn't see
He will claim the right to be free!

And faith is his essence to live
And hope is the first dawn he sees
Never being lost in himself, in his dreams...
Who will give him the right to be free?

I wander in this nothingness!
Remember the man I was before
But who is to blame, but who is to condemn
Are we just born in order to bleed?
