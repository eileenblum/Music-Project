See the swans that fly above your head, remember the spell she put on them
You made the promise to free them from the hatred of the queen
Now time has come 

Pick the nettle in the cemetery of witches never say an only word and never cry, just pray, just believe in yourself, be strong and weave again your innocent 
swans above your head, angels of innocence murmured

Weave elisa, weave, my angel your brothers will be saved

These nettles will be your salvation
My silence is my prayer

Burn this witch who never say a word, who plays with the essence of satan

To the stake
Iâm innocent
What are these swans that go back to this damned?
Iâm innocent

The road to the stake is so longâ¦ weaving the last chainmail, she keeps on praying
Will the spell find an end, will the innocence be the key of all?
Iâm innocent
I flew to deliverance
Come, my brothers!
