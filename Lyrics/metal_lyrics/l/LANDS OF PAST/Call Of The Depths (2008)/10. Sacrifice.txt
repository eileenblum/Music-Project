Flames of Hell
You can burn my eyes
Now i'm blind
Take me, but spare her young mind

Survive in the darkness
She appears, She flies in front of my eyes as a ghost she stole my tears, my fears
Lost in time in your fortress
You can bruise the blood in her veins, but you can never bend her pure soul ou spirit

I cry
You can burn my eyes
Now i'm blind
Take me, but spare her young mind

Lost in the shadow my daughter roams without finding, the good road
I call her: âlynda where are you? itâs your father!â but my words fly away forever

Flames of Hell
You can burn my eyes
Now i'm blind
Take me, but spare her young mind

In this world there is only one judge, there is only one law, blood for a blood, soul for a soul

Goodbye my lynda i have to stay here but youâll never be alone
