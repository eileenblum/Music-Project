Behold my pledge, behold my farewell
We used to grow together...
Will tomorrow keep us alive?

On this ground Iâll fall down to nothingness,
Remember those days,
When my games were yours.

Never deny your own name, your memories,
Nor your silent pain,
Never let them take your own life,
Never try to fall as I will do.

forgotten, forbidden, forgiven secrets we had...
forgiven, forgotten, forbidden dreams followed our past.

Never spit on your fatherâs name,
you were born to serve his faith,
I know they will take your life
Iâll embrace your fall, as I always used to.

forgotten, forbidden, forgiven secrets we had...
forgiven, forgotten, forbidden dreams followed our past.

Forgive me,
... Nothing to forgive!
I canât bleed...
...never bleed for me!
I leave you...
... leaving for this!

... for nothing!
Oh... oh....
