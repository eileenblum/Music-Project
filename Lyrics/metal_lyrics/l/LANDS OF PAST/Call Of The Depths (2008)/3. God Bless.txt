She is waiting for him to come
Under frozen skies heâs goneâ¦ to the front
He promised her heâd come back soon
And as she stares at the moonâ¦ in the curse night

She feels within her own veins like an omen
Will he really be saved? Does he feel alone is there a shroud on his beloved face?

Our child offered his last sigh to the anger of a gunâ¦
Will he care ?
As I am waiting for your skin, who can tell me if youâre stillâ¦ still aliveâ¦

God bless their souls

Ã my Lord, just hear my tears, make his name become mine
Ã my child, I hope our paths will gather to make oneâ¦

Iâm still alive , you can hear the beating of my heart , but my soul is cold...

Who are these men who give their life, for a nation, for a Man
They donât know their hatred become their cross and their families are lost
Waiting for themâ¦

I met again the ground, the stones, my fields and my empty homeâ¦ until dawnâ¦
Could you tell me what will be our lives, our children, our countryâ¦ tomorrow?
