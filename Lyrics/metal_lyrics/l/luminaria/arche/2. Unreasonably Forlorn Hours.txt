So why the chosen one I am?
To sit there in an empty room
Smashed with the windâs cold hands
Frozen by the winterâs kiss
In this unreasonably forlorn hours
Itâs better to fall asleep
Eyes welcoming night
Sinking in a silent cry

To get inside â itâs filling up my head
Through veins to heart Iâm getting high â above myself
Iâ¦ Iâm so far, lost in mind, having time of my death

So why is this room the chosen one
For me to sit there in emptiness?
Who let the wind to smash my face?
To carry winterâs kiss?
In this unreasonably forlorn hours
Itâs better to fall asleep
This timeâs so pitiful
Morpheus makes me dream

âIâm inside your mind
Iâm among your blood
Iâll make You say words You donât understand
Iâll make You beg me to go awayâ
