I hope I wonât have to
Endure despite the curses
And the bad wills
No need to resign
To express or to choose

And to loose for you the heart
To be but face to face
To have the approval of your traits
No tricks, no intrigues

An enigmatic spirit makes that
I will never say: Itâs too late
I want to submerge (myself)
Into your grandeurâs seems
Into godâs visiting card

And to loose for you the heart
To be but face to face
To have the approval of your traits
No tricks, no intrigues

And to look inside your soul
To realize that Iâm standing alone
No one cares
No tricks, no intrigues
