In your enchanted land,
In your strange demi-world,
Live delusions
That excite your ego,
Caress your vanity.

A bit of hypocrisy,
Some connections,
And to have a ready tongue.
Then you create
A magic frame of big world.

Simulated friendships.
Invented events.
False achievements.
You enjoy living in this illusory show.

You dive in a charming dream
And you let the others believe in it.
But what will remain of nothing?
What will remain of you?
