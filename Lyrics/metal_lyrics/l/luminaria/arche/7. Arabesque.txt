Iâm shattered, in pieces
And lost in the ice abyss.
I am biting my numb lips
The arabesque of hurting.
Hiding all of the visions
Under the curtain of despair
Swallowing bitter experience
I am

(Youâre)
A sea of cold flames
Masterpiece of force
Art of sacred rules
You never defrost?

Fever atmosphere, diverging thoughts,
A melody of discords, phariseean love.

Iâm an empty shell
Echosâ treasury
Dancing on the waves
Memories among stormâs insanity
All falling leaves
Wonât remind you of me

This punitive ...sounds
This blazing ...eyes
This bitter ... words
Still wish I had died.

But Iâll sank
A million times
In the sea of cold flames.
Still alive.
Is the pain infinitive?â¦

Then I am really shattered
Laying on your arras body
In this ancillary position
Like a burnt offering.

Sweat covered my forehead
Hands tied up in embrace
Tongues of burning pleasure
I am

You ornate me
with your design of power.
The complex mosaic
Of an interior movement.
The intricate czardas dance
Pleasure and suffer.

Youâre sea of vivid flames
I am panchromatic matter.
A masterpiece of love
The arabesque of suffer.

Iâll swim a million times
In plurima incendia.
Later, disobidient, go inshore.
Spend hours waiting
In the antechamber
of  your grace.
Finally look for an antidote.

Youâre sea of vivid flames
I am panchromatic matter.
A masterpiece of love
The arabesque of suffer.
