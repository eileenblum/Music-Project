Irmao I wonât disappear
Iramo When youâre waking up
All your senses, all your feelings
Irmao â I am not your god
Iramo - Come take my arm
Irmao When your closing up
To the real world, away from dreams
Irmao â I am not your god

You arenât an icon of past
You arenât an opaque flash forward
You are the fragments of looking glass
Broken, but reflective

We have yet time
To rend our garments
To look out the window
Did destiny change itâs mind
To empty the eyes of despair
Overboundance
We have yet enough time

And I am not your god
But weak and imperfect
Although I can be your humble monastery
Where you may deposit
Doubts, anger or reveries

Donât recede towards an abstract space
Before the time prescribed
Before this compulsory separation
I can show you the charm of ordinary day
Elementary colors
Leave your dreams of solitude
Fake misanthropic reality
Letâs enjoy the true presence
Iâm a sacred vase with divine breath
