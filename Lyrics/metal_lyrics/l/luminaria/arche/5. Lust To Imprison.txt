Naked witch on my bed
Is it disease or lust
Show me whatâs on your mind
Is it so hard?

Iâm just here to crawl in your legs
Iâm to suck your breasts
Unleash your anger, desire and pain
I want to suffer

â¦.raging soul
Whatâs on your mind?
I want it to be hard.

Donât worry no one will get known
Whose job that bloody scar is
I know that youâre not human
Youâre beast

Your nails on my back
Drawing the picture of madness
Your lips passionate
But face expressing the sadness
Why, please tell me why?
Am I too weak to give you pleasure
Or am I too real
