[Music: Lividity / Lyrics: Varela]

Girl you will loathe it
I'll make you love it
Sticking my cock, up your tight ass!
Please, please get to your knees
Spread those cheeks, so I'll get in with ease
Face down, ass up... bitch this will hurt
So pucker that hole and let me squirt
No mayonnaise, no mustard, no crisco, no KY, no lotion to lather up that hole

No time for lube [x3], you fucking skank
No time for lube [x3], you fucking skank

Your ass is mine, no pun intended
There is no lube, just shut your mouth
Your eyes fixated on my dry tool, bitch I best not pull out any stool

Try to spit on my cock
Try to spit on my cock, I dare you to
I'll rectally violate you, all night long
Screams of anal agony, go unheard
Face embedded in pillow, to muffle sound

Plead with me to tag that pussy one more time
I deny requests unless it's anal
Bewildered look in her, and my infatuation with her ass
Shit eating grin on her face, she takes one more for the team

My cock begins to give therapy to that little confused rectal hole
Ass split open wide, and desecration
She barely endures this violation

Bitch please me, let me ream you rectally [x2]

No time for lube, you fucking whore bend over and take it dry
I love tits and smelly little clits, but bung is the best of all [x2]

Thrusting hard cock, balls deep, sack beating up your clit
Pull out my shit laden cock, the stench just will not quit
Bitch pass gas, let me see that cum bubble out your ass [x2]

No time for lube, you fucking whore bend over and take it dry
I love tits, and smelly little clits, but bung is the best of all [x2]
