[Music: Lividity / Lyrics: Bishop]

I will rape you from behind. Stench of your virginity overwhelms
Forcing my cock the mouth, Suck it you worthless whore

Grinding, pumping, ripping, tearing, raping 'til your dead
Make you vomit feces, all over my dick

Fucking in both holes, pleasure to me, sacred act of killing
I will rape and fuck you 'til there's nothing left to rape and fuck
Then fuck some more, Ignore your screams for mercy

God can't save me, my mind is bound, crucified
My guilt is laid upon the cross for all the world to see
I will slit you up your crack, aroused by virgin blood, cumming on your
bloodstained tits

Both chics, dead by now, More I need, man, my dick is stiff now
Reach back and lick it, never will I miss the stench of shit that
overwhelms all my sense of reason

Fucking your ass 'til your body turns numb
You will cry and scream as I pump in your ass
Beg for me to quit, All the pain that I've inflicted
Why don't I just kill you now?

Cry and scream as I pump in your ass [x4]

The pain goes on, To dine on flesh and beat the corpse into submission
Prosthetic decay as I rot in the bowels of disease
