[Music: Varela / Lyrics: Varela]

Suffer the anger of my dick
You endure the rage of my balls
No women have ever won
All whores shall succumb
The battle of phallic shall begin
And bitch believe me I shall win
All the scars my cock left on your twat
Whore, suck it and rot

Crushing, decimate, defile, obliterate
Violate, annihilate, menstrually, sexually

Since now you are my sex slave
Pave way for my fat cock
Shut your fucking mouth or squeal like a pig
Either way shall suffice
Now be a good skank and open wide
Or I'll donkey punch out your fucking teeth
Try to resist and I'll crush your skull
All reprives are null

Violently, intentionally, battering, slamming
Vaginally, anally, orally, sexually

My anger grows with each pump
Soon I'll take a fat shit
Right up in your cum dumpster
Feces and jizz are my tools of the trade

Bow to me you whore, as I make you feel worthless
Sanctify my dick, with the edge of your tongue
Crawl up to my feet, look up worship my cock
Grab each inch of my meat, take it and choke yourself

Bow to me whore

Days of defilement, from bodily battering
Hours of intense pain, from rectal reamage
Minutes of agony, from asphyxiation
Seconds of inhaling, the gushing of my spooge

This has been my final hour, violating this stupid whore
This magnitude of vindication, ripping her twat and it's anticipation
Hours of excrement, natural lubrication
Days of reckoning, I am a supreme force
