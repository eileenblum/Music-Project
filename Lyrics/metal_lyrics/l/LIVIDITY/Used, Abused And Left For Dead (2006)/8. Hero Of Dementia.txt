[Music: Lividity / Lyrics: Kibler, Varela]

The stench of decomposing flesh, permeates the air, a creation of
Disgusting cruelty murdering
The whores and junkies as my prey, of opportunity, motive unknown
Strangled and dismembered cannibal
Dumping, the bodies in a pit, crushing of their bones, severing and
Disposing of the mangled tragedy
Changing, methods of their torture, burning of my victims, six feet under
Take the probing tool and penetrate

Dripping, pulp, transformation
Dressed myself in her skin, beg for
You're life, cries of anguish, flesh starts to decay
No one knows you have been gone so
Long, missing, from society
Sweet demise of your existence
Torture, is an addiction, ecstasy
DNA samples control my FATE

Deformed visions, chaos
Undying need to kill
Provoked by female flesh
Pent up, churning madness

Hero of dementia, the whores and junkies as my prey
Of opportunity, motive unknown, strangled and dismembered cannibal
Dumping the bodies in a pit, crushing of their bones, severing
Disposing of the mangled tragedy, changing methods of their torture

The way I feel when I kill and how I cut all her fucking flesh off
Brutalize, demoralize, fantasize, stroking my knife
Welcome to my world, assisting you with your pain
Masochistic and sadistic, moralistic view of your demise

How many choices do I have, so many ways to kill
Beatings are supreme, ropes used for gags, tape used to bind
Now I have their total attention and their in my control
See the view of perspiration, watch their flesh become moist
Initialize my thoughts of cannibalism and dreaming of eating their meat

Hero of dementia, the whores and junkies as my prey
Of opportunity, motive unknown, strangled and dismembered cannibal
Dumping the bodies in a pit, crushing of their bones, severing
Disposing of the mangled tragedy, changing methods of their torture
