[Music: Lividity / Lyrics: Bishop]

Nighttime falls, as I creep into my room
Her eyes gazing, frantically for her life
Preparing to die, I'll drag her body to my lair
Violently reacting, to my every command

Death will come
When you bleed
Nice and slow
Raging uncontrollably I

Rip off your arms
Then your legs
Leaving your torso
Twitching and convulsing as I

Force your mouth on my dick
Fuck the stumps where legs went
Use your arms for chopsticks
Then I'll...

Use a knife like a dick
Ream your cunt till it rips
Watch the blood and cum mix
Then I'll...

Cut your throat as I thrust
Mutilate your cold snatch
My face glazed with your blood
I use it for lube too

Penetrate your tight ass
You're a bitch and a slut
Used for sex and much more
Left for dead on a rural road

Left there for the bugs to eat you'll...

Decompose
Rotting till there's nothing left
You fucking bitch
Used, abused and left for dead
