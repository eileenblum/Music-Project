Mangled flesh hangs from the walls, beckoned cries,
crucify, blood filled skies, emancipate, shadow of evil
from another demension! Stew of human remnants, vital
remains, severed limbs, devour...eagerly! Torn apart as
you crave life, blackness lurks with every stab, blood
spilling forth to create destructive lust! Stew of human
remnants, vital remains, severed limbs, devour...eagerly!
