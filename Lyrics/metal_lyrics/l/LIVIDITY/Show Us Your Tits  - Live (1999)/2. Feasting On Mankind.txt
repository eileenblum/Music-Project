Feasting through my wasteland, greeting all who come! Not knowing eternity, not till I'm done! Soon 
this life will end, when the dead are dead, coats of fleash and bloody stumps! Lust and pain nothing 
to me! I see your life, come on to thee! come into my room, a pleasurable treat, cock already out, doom! 
Hear the wenches scream at night, who will be the first to knife? Taking them on by one! Cooking the 
vagina till it's done! Crucify me for I'm your God, drive the spikes straight through! Release your soul, 
and it will be mine, feasting on minkind!
