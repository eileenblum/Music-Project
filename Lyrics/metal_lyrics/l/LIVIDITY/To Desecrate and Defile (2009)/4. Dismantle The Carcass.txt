Rotting, smell the stenchShocking, can't help but stareMaggots, feast on flesh Dismantle the carcass Severed, arms and legsIntestines, hang from wallsDismembered, a gory mess Dismantle the carcass Blood, covers the floorsFrom, these dead whoresScraping, flesh and boneSoon to become one Carving, how I wantCraving, how I needSmearing, this on meDismantle the carcass Gore stain these wallsBroke and damaged bonesThe sickest sight you will seeDismantle the carcass Heart ripped from the chestInnards are half eatenBut I'll be back lor moreDismantle the carcassI'll be back for moreDismantle the carcass
