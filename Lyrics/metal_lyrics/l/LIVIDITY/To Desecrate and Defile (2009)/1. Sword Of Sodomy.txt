Back to Lividity's pageGently I bend you overMy cum covered couchProtruding rectumWith no lubrication Virgin anal wallsHow far can they stretchSlowly I beginTo re-sheath the flesh sword Face stretched in painAnother inch of meMy cock frolicsYour shit churns So much tighter than your cuntYou don't lie lifeless nowMy hands gripping hipsAs you dig harder into the fabrics Your dry dirty rectumChaffs my thrusting cockSo close to achieving anal-gasmI cum first and retract My fudgestick replaced with my mighty rigid fistFeces now a lubricant as you are ripped beyond bejiefUrine trickles through crusted pubic hairClobbered battered anus spread wideLaying smiling and bleeding
