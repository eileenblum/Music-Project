I don't care about the pain I have caused youIn my mind I am right for what I have doneYour thoughts bring you back to the suffering and the fearTearing your flesh was sweet to behold You are so weak, pathetic, fragileI wanted so much more miseryBut you would not allowYou gave up too quickly This wasn't precious for youThere was no fight in youI gave you the chances to see if you'd take themBut feeble you lay crying instead Worthless and a waste of my timeI am the artist, you are my tattered canvasNot worth the paint that has spilledI did enjoy your screams however The others before you fought backYou could stand to learn from themYou will see them soonWherever they are, or have been I think of them oftenI will not waste thoughts on you If s going awayDo you even realizeI have given youThe freedom you don't deserve
