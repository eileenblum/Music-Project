Carefully choosing my tools
Only the sharpest of devices
While caressing the stomach
I slowly begin insertion

Blindly I try to find the life the grows within
And Inner Fetal Dismemberment will begin

Fluids rush as the embryonic sac in punctured
Moaning, Bloated, Bitch
Severed appendages, decapitated
Blood spews from your widened crevice
Drenched in the fluids
Contractions begin

Push
Your cunt becomes vomitous
Push
spitting ragged pieces of flesh
Push
Undeveloped bones piece and splinter
Push
Guts and mushy pulp-like flesh

Tiny intestines fall like shit
From the mutilated birth canal
To the floor this horrid mess
Thin tender skin so sweet
Join me in my feast
Mouth waters with anticipation
She helps me indulge in this meal
Lust marinade delicacy
She has created

Thanks to tom_rieck for correcting track #11 lyrics.
