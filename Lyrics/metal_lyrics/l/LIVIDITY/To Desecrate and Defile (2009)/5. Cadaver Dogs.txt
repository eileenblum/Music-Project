Somewhere unknown Under soil and earth Her body waits The story to tell Resultless efforts Call the hounds of death The scent decayed like flesh Sun baked soil Putrefaction drenched Create vegetation The sick cycle of life/death Through feet of earth Death attracts Unearth the dead Crusted deep                                           The newly placed artifactCarefully exposedBeyond recognitionA mother's fear revealedAppendages no longer bound by muscle and skinMatted, blood dried hairMissing flesh reveals boneHidden chapters to the still unfolding storyThe canine macabre                                 Salivating, rotting meat arousing In the burning sun Her body wafts The story begins
