In the dead night I seekVirgins smell good to meSo pure and innocentSacrificial bliss Conjure powers to stayUnholy mass I prayUncontrolled urge I feelArt of blasphemy Guide us tonight we shareEverlasting darknessImmortal army comesLucifer's legion Bloody dusk of chaosCrossing the burning pathThe bleeding crucifixTo destroy Christian race SatanicSalvationIs callingYou from another world UnholyRedemptionIs burningChristian faith abandon Kissing the steelVisit the reaperAnguish and despairDarkness engulfs youIn for the killNever ending hateConfined to HellDemons rise upWitness witching hour Blades marking skinFor our sacrificeTo sustaining freedom Horned heathen lurkingOver ripping fleshPentagram held high Blasphemous codesChanted in the night This is what I seek Eternal firesBurning brightCaldron of bloodDrink to rejoice Wings in the darkSoar through the airServant's of HellOpen the gates Denouncing ChristAs a saviorNo messtahHangs on the cross A grave land of deathUnholy cultTake your last breathBody and soul......are now set free Satanic SalvationIs callingYou from another world UnholyRedemptionIs burningYour life is now set free
