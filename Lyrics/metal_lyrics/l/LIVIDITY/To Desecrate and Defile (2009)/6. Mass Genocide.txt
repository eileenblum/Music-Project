Human trophies, your demise, staring back at meSharpening the blade, to dissect the corpse, tough gristle I will hackDecomposing rapidly, blue toned skin, mixed with bloodRigor mortis and lividity, rectify the smell Torture tactics, tortured souls Forensic malpractice, solidifies my deviant ways In my eyes, you are divine Laying there in pieces It's no surprise, this reality It's no surprise, face insanity What you see is what you get Witness decline of humanity No more pain, no more fear Cadaver of debauchery Nothing you can do to ease this fucking painSlow torturous death, life ending consequenceAdmiration of your fear, all i see is brutality Squirm and twitch to elude the tyrantA sigh of relief, the depths of Hell, a voice calls your name Fear the unknown belief, kiss of deathSlice of the blade, bad luck or misfortune Looking at the gaze in your eyes Are you talking to the dead?A victim of the killing circumstance True to the end, screams and cries of torturous death Cannot be stopped, this is my calling Human trophies, your demise, staring back at meSharpening the blade, to dissect the corpse, tough gristle I will hackDecomposing rapidly, blue toned skin, mixed with bloodRigor mortis and lividity, rectify the smell Torture tactics, tortured soulsForensic malpractice, solidifies my deviant waysIn my eyes, you are divineLaying there in piecesIt's no surprise, this realityIt's no surprise, face insanity Cadaver of debauchery
