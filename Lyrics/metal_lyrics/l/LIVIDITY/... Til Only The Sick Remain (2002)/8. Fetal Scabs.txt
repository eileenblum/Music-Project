[Music: Lividity; Lyrics: Bishop]

Fetal
Take me with your axe
Eviscerate the fetus thats left
Abortion by man made means
Oozing, the scabs they bleed
I grabbed her quick
Stuck my dick in her face
Said "Suck it bitch"
"If you want to life"
Young girls are what we crave
Strangled on a noose 
Skewered and filleted
All around bodies burn to ash
Anguish and torment
Your pretty little face we smash
Beating the fetus
'Til it's dead... "Why won't you die?"
Picking the scabs off her head
Pumping faster, pumping deep
My thick cock meets tight young meat
Spread your legs, and you'll recieve
Remove the scabs and watch them bleed
I grabbed her quick
Stuck my dick in her face
Said "Suck it bitch"
"If you want to life"
