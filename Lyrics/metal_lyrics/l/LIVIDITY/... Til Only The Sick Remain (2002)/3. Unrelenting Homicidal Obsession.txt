[Music: Bishop; Lyrics: Bishop]

Watching you for month
Shadows have become my friends
Waiting for my time to come
Finally I'll take my revenge...revenge
All done
Young and sweet
Scared as shit
Of what I...
Might do when you are asleep at night
In your bed
I creep in
Take what I... want, without giving a shit
Covering your mouth
So you can't scream
Tying your wrists
Legs spread apart
Fucking you harder as blood starts to leak
Tearing you twat
Clenching my fists
Around your throat
Die you slut
Don't blame me
Blame yourself
And that mouth [2x]
Watching you now for months
Shadows have become my friends
Waiting for my time to come
Finally I'll take my revenge...revenge
Dead and gone
Six feet deep
Buried in
Shallow ground...
That I reserved for your stinking corpse
God the smell
Makes me stiff
Dig you up...
And fuck your corpse again
