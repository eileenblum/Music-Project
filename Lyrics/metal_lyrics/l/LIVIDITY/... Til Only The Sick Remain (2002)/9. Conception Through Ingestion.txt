[Music: Bishop; Lyrics: Bishop]

Dead I lay before you as you feast upon my flesh
Ripping apart my torso till you see there's nothing left
Moving throug your stomach and intestines to your womb
Growing stronger everday to gain control of you
Growing strong
Feeding on your ovaries
Taking form
Not the man I used to be
Stronger
Deformed
Crippled
Insane
Organs enter from inside, I'll tear apart you womb
Raped before and after death then bury you in a grave of shit
Conception through ingestion [4x]
Now reborn
From sick and diseased
Ravaged cunt
Dying as you cum
Conception through ingestion [4x]
