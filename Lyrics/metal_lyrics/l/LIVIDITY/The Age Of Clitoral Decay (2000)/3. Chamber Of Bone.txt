Putrid, rancid mesh of flesh, set fire by desire. Burning
to ash, then collected, for our sadistic pleasing.
Carving pentagram onto virgins back, masses silently
chant. For a end to it all. Enter the chamber
of bone, forgive me for the horrors you see. Carnage,
mutilated cadavers. Bodies ripped to shreds. Carving
pentagram onto virgins back, masses silently
chant. For a end to it all. Back to the time
of magic. For a end to it all. Kneel down
before me, you taughnt me with lies I've heard before.
Slaughter, generations of women who are nothing less than
whores. Chained and shacled. Cut off your head. Smeared
the blood. Covered in feces. The sanctaty.....of this
place.....has been fouled!! How do I endure the pain that
I endure? Sacred art of butchery. How do I endure the
pain that I endure? (Love to fuck ya) Blessed act of
sodomy. Enter the chamber!!
