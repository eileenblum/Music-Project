So you won't let me stick it in your ass you fuckin'
whore! Well suck on this!! Whores and bitches, taking my
load. Sit down, lie back, don't breathe, kill you in the
nighty, then fuck, cut you from privates. Make you drink
the blood, of my God. Maggot...ridden...human...feast.
Say your no whore, prove it to me. Never will you see me,
never will you hurt me, never will you ever will you fuck
me again. Say you're no whore, prove it to me, I will
prove you wrong. Say you're no whore, prove it to me.
Never will you see me, never will you hurt me, never will
you ever will you fuck me again. Say you're no whore,
prove it to me. Never will you see me, never will you
hurt me, never will you ever will you fuck me again. Cult
of death, bleeding from the virgins cunt. Fuck off life,
lust to worship a lord. I will kneel, I am your strength
now. Praise to hell, priority shaft satisfaction. Dark
emotions swell in my brain as I bust a load in your ass.
Sodomy ritual, savage butchery to an orifice. Repulsive
practice, taking my length. Suck my dick you whore. God
can't help this time. Suck my dick bitch.
