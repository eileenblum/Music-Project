Life is circles... lead to you
Wild journey with no return
Five fingers are not enough
To cope it with a smile.

Glance the dark in me
Just one single color... black
Like my past.... like my love
An everlasting nightmare

So blind to see my present
So sad to make a smile
So mad to look ahead
So damned to going on...

The smell of the past
Caves my bleeding lungs
To smile is to forget
And to forget is to die
