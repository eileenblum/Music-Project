These pregnant clouds of moments wont carry the burden forever...
And someday the rains...
Will heal us...
Relive us...
Atone our sins...
And stop these sad melodies...

Carved on my forehead are the meanings of your drippy name
And sticking on my tongue is the taste of your hidden beauty
Glorious tear in its way to touch the cold air...
In its journey to reach the solid ground below my existence...

Rid my wings from distance
And turn the other page...
