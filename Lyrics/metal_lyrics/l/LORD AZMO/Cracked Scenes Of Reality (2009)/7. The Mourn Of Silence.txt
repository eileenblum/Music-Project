Entangled in wordless room
Ugly dreams won't ever be awake
Like the plague depression spreads
Mirthless seasons have no end

And now the roses of death have grown
Upon my broken back
Can I bear this..?
Can I..?

I will awake from this slumber
And I will face... my second birth

Lay your flowers of hate above my silence
My tortured echoes will fade someday the beauty withered...
And tonight we leap to the other side of this shattered universe

The mourn of silence has been heard by me
It led me to hear their secrets...
Their mournful cries...

And it led me to my abandoned Eden
