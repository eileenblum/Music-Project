Black is the night...
Black is the day...
Even the visions are crashed away
Come take this soul...
Come end this tale...
Come save my morning from yesterday
I feel I am drifting far from the light longing for a morning ...
After this night
The blood around me...
Atones my sins...
The shadows have gone...
And coldness begins

Farewell reality!
Forever I am free!
No more pains no more lies...
No more blood to see...
