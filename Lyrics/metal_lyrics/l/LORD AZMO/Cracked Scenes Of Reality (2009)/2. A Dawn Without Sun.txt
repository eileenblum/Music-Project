The night has ended... yet the day at birth
The past has died ...and sank with the moon
I am waiting the light ...staring at the skies
No horizon and no sun appears
Maybe its the end...

I will always remember the blinding sun of joy
And I will always call ...the strength of life within
I will hide beneath the silence of your time
And I will always scream ...salvation from this life

Maybe it's the end ...of all the innocent dreams...
...no one can hear me now...

I miss the taste of warmth
Coldness eats my bones
Is this eternal night?

Or July of crimson sea?
