Have some little tears to seize this darkness

Another drop of blood will promise that we won't ever leave
These tears of joy you will remember
And every kiss won't fade away
Just take me and let me bleed
Let your angel purify the way

I knew you and I know
The distance between the flames
The places to grow without
And the places that miss our names
Sometimes it feels too cold
When the flames about to sober
Insane they will be...
Around you..

Around you I'll be
Around you I'll be free
Take me and let me in
Inside your heart ...I am burning

Step by step to eleven years
Crashing past and slaying fears
By two numb souls... And a rose
Torn rose for every year
And now ...I want you

...my dark girl

11 will be the time ..
Of these times of mine entwined...
Your face with sparks of light
11... Torn... Roses
...through the mourn of silence
