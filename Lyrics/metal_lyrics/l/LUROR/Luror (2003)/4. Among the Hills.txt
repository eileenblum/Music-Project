Among the hills war is raging
Battle of a final kind
Apocalypse has become the truth
The last and only truth

Nothing is real now but death
Nothing is beginning but the end

Arise from the ashes of the world
In a war of demons and men
Against the angels from the palace of light
Against the reign of the weak

I see it in the black horizons
The shadows that come close
I view it in the water of rivers
As the water turns red

I hear it in the screams of the slain
Smell it in the boiling air
Taste the sweetness of total death
Feel it by the steel in hand

Now we march towards the foe
Living and dead ones
This is the end of the world
And it shall be...
