I am a creature of the darkest of nights
Am your yearning and your fear
Your crown of thorns am I
And your cross to bear

The god of hypocrites has blessed the light
So that I have to avoid
Wandering the somber woods
The paths that no one knows
Among the wolves, hunting the prey
Into the shadows, flee from the day

Come take my hand you little ember
Unite with Glory, Darkness and me
Follow me into the realms of evil
Of blaspheme insanity

Out there in the artificial world
All light is a lie as the love of God
But here into the solitude
Ember becomes fire again
Flames for the dying world to see
A sign of glory, darkness and me

I am the bearer of the inner light
Retaliation of your forgotten self
Born from the flames
Embers and Glory, Darkness and Me
