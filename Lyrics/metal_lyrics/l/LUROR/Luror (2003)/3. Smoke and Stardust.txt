If this is life I'm captured in
What is outside of these grey plastic walls?
Burning letters written in crimson
Tranquilized but boiling blood
Gives nothing but a hint to the exit
I blend my essence with alcoholic spirits
While the pulse is running out of time
The experience of physical pain
Seems unavoidable now

A warrior's instinct in a demonic embrace
A madman's inspiration the advice
Drowning in folklore pictures
If the spirits come to catch me
I won't run to hide...

Riding the smoke of burning wisdom
Of burning books and dead words,
Thoughts are overcome by visions
To conquer stardust at last

A warrior's spirit in search of the truth
A shaman's way to claim existence
The spirits won't burn for the fire is me...

If this is life I'm captured in
I will conquer death in time...
