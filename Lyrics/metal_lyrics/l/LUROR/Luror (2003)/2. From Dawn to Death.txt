From the dawn to the end
My ship sails in endless seas of tears
From the dawn to the end
Your soul is drowning in future fears

What's life in relation to existence?
Is a suicide solution
The unknown retribution
A selective evolution
From the dawn to the end

Is your end of less importance than your birth?
If you never created any worth
Will there be more less a life?
And will there be a life after the knife?

In growing famine of the mind
The artificial visions make you blind
And as infinity's a notion for the strong
In your heart it's forgotten whole life long

From the dawn to the end
Prepare to leave in honour
From dawn to death
The knife's your best friend...
