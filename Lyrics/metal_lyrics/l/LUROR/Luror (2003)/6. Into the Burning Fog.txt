Not alone here
Bound to this damned place
Where not a human's heart is pounding
Where no life dwells
But I am not alone

It will be the last view for me
Before I leave this life
No laughing faces all around
No mercy, no pity, no cure
I am obsessed to end this life
To reach the might of existence

Black is the steel of the knife in my hands
Black are the skies above
Black is the soil of these unholy lands
Black as my solitary funeral march
To hell...

As I enter immortality
As I follow the voices in my head
In the moment I cut my flesh
In the moment of great sacrifice
The voices within turning to low
As I drown in the burning fog
