In a room in hell
I lived my whole life
In deepest mourning I dwell
Paid rent by the knife

The Faustian spirit
In search for knowledge
Sails the seas of blood
Once more...

The contract's not signed at once
Paying the devil again and again
My blood is shed again and again
In a room in hell
I myself become the one with horns!
