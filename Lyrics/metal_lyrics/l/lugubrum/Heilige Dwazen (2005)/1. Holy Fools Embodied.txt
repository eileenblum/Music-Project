In spring I did not sleep for forty nights
Nor did I change my underwear
And the grass-stalks along my arduous path
Sang that it was good
For they witnessed my fasting
Surviving on spiritual beer
I became Christs; a whole bunch of them
We flogged each other
In our ferocious dance
Spinning like dogs behind our tails
And none of us changed his underwear
