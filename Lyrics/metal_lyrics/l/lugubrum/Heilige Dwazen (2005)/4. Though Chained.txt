I have already seen the Black Prophecies
About the earthly demon's trap
And all it's illusions
Brothers, let us break the chains
And pee liberally on those
Who point their pigeon beaks
Within safe range of the flock
Dancing bears, be unleashed
Upon your ruthless spectators
Be free, radicals
To destroy my structures
I have already eaten the desert sand
