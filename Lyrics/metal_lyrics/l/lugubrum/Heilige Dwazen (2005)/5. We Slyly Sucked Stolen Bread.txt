We had no need for teeth or wits
We lost both while eating bananas
And wearing furry hats
Luxuries we solemnly rejected
In favour of hard pilgrim life
And public masturbation
We had no need for bathwater
Our aura repelled the undead
And perturbed the diplomat monkeys
Who jumped and whined
But had to applaud our stealing
