the spectre rose in pain
a shadow brown , obscure and vast
like a statue of lead
bent by its fall from the high Totem
the dolorous shadow rose

its cry pierced the skies
and drove the birds from heaven
like rats into hell
the mountain devoured the sun
swilled down its golden rays

born deep in the Baltic wild
white as an angel this enormous child
twas its soul which bore us fright
Brown , as if beraeved of light
