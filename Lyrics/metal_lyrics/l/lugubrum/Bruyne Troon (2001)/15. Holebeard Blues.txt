[lyrics not included in booklet]

I've got the holebeard , baby
I've got the holebeard bad
since you left me baby
it started growing real fast

ain't never had no holebeard
never cared for that mess
(but) now I'm lying in the gutter , baby
it's growing ten feet out of my ass

I'm growing my holebeard
comb it every day
I'm growing my holebeard , baby
and watch the end turn grey
