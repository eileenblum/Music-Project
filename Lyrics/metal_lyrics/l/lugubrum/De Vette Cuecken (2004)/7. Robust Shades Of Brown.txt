I repose eagerly
The bloated digester
Beneath the turban
Thrall to tepid thoughts

In the thick leaden smoke
the richest of visions
tastes of power
forged formlessly
in twilight timbre

Straight from the plantation
robust shades of brown
are puffed before my eyes
I don the ghostly robe and crown
and charm the wriggling tar
