Attractive...to the flies
I am their precious meal
Through compound eyes
I envision eternity

Mouth organs chew away
At my sweetest memories and fears

Attractive...to the flies
I am their giant tidbit
Tremendous a buzzing which engulfs all
in the jet landscape of this dream

Attractive...to the flies
I am their mephitic trough
Hairy ferrymen between two realities
A Styx of digestive liquid
