This is a complication which comes after some surgical interventions.The pulmonary artery irrigated by the obstructed aterial branch becomes liable to necrosis and hemorrhages.The blood gets into the pulmonary alveolus causing serious disturbances to the affected patient.Its precise location will depend of the ingurgigated area.If the breathing ways aren`t sterile there will be infection on the necrosed tissue of the lung. The ingurgitation of the lungs happens mostly in patients who are in the hospital.The origin of the embolism may be a neglected phlebitis, other embolisms may appear , causting serious troubles. Surgical processes constitute the only effective treatment.
