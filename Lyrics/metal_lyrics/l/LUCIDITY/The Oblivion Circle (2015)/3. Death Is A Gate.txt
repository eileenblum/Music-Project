In the womb, surrounded by white noise
Of a faceless world, that has bled so many cycles
Mirrors unseen, for human emotions so fragile
The seed of the earth, only taken small steps to transform

And over the silence, the voice is strongest
Death is unavoidable, death is a gate
Reaching beyond the walls, to overcome all chemical sleep
Death is unavoidable, death is a gate

The waves of energy, insights and rituals to the ghosts
To create from collective, mental creations
Our life-spans, burning quicker
But the sands of time, draw closer

All truths hidden, behind all words written
Death is unavoidable, death is a gate
To be discovered, beneath the burning feathers
Death is unavoidable, death is a gate

Distance in words and deeds
Hiding from weakness
Blindfolded by needs
Dreams of love and fear we see

Overwhelming to offer, to drink a wine of blood
Death is unavoidable, death is a gate
From the shadow, from our own hands
Death is unavoidable, death is a gate
