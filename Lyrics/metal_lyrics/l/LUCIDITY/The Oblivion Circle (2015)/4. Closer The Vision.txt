Night time, my friend, fallen again
Like it did the first time
Can you feel it coming in?
Through the walls, opening

Passing memories, they are here
Creeping through the corridors
The body, the mind and the heart
Seeing through doors of perception
To dreams made of both; to dreams
Shadows and suns raging sparks

Closer the vision, unaware or awaken
Reality disappears, removed and replaced
Pulled fast upwards the ceiling
A spiral of time without human meaning

It repeats; a night time, my friend
A perfect labyrinth within the circles
Noises not the way they used to sound
To remind us of the escape from the ever-sleeping ground

To dreams made of both; to dreams
Shadows and suns raging sparks

Penetrate the led and ether
Beyond the fragile rooms of earth
Imprisoned and bound to illusions
To depart by hours of my rebirth
