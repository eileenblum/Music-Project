Few steps closer, yet further away
Trying to leave, yet still you stay
Empty words, with no meaning
Hear my echo, yet not what Iâm saying

You deny my denial, within your skin
Deny control, and live in sin
Leave no trace, as you walk
Death comforts, with death you talk

Turn blind eye for that fake smile
The past wonât hide itâs scars
With shaking hands you try to open the knot
With the thought of vivid tomorrow

Appearing as a dream
It is here to harvest and redeem

Stay still for awhile and examine what is left
Of your dreams from yesterday

Fade into the air
With empty stare
To starry skies above
Reminding you`re alone

Weakened by light, suffocated by control
The hell within brakes loose, after those words

Come drown in me
For eternity
First touch is cold
Then youâll feel warm

Leave no trace, as you walk
Death comforts, with death you talk

Fade into the air
With empty stare
To starry skies above
Reminding you`re alone
