So I send a silent wish
From the borders of this mind
For winter to hurry
Though sound of rain comforts from outside

With burning candles
Vanity is long gone here
Considering nights like these are many
Something moves and leads deeper to meet one self

Mere drop in the ocean
Four flames light the mirror
Marks the sun and the moon
I am aware invoking life by those who invoke death

Will reach it without a doubt
Perhaps now I have a clue
What they meant when they said in my dreams;
"There are many ways to exist in this mortal world"

Believe in the process to born again
Believe in the process to born again

Will reach it without a doubt
Perhaps I have a clue
What they meant when they said in my dreams;
"There are many ways to exist in this mortal world"

And press my palm
against my scars
