These gnawing hours of darkness
Descending pressure, so it is dark now
Demons of emptiness gather, they smile
Cast a glimpse of what some call evil

Somehow the rain falls colder
Somehow the rain falls colder

Behind the veil, something familiar
So deep, so wounded, too much to bear
To understand when the flames burn to dust
We must enter the room and let one shine to rust

Then the roads leading further somewhere
Losses transform to sorrow
As dwellers on the thresholds, all remaining from us
Memories we leave to grow on their hearts

Somehow the rain falls colder
Somehow the rain falls colder

Behind the veil, something familiar
So deep, so wounded, too much to bear
To understand when the flames burn to dust
We must enter the room and let one shine to rust

Beyond our reach we lay our eyes
On that pain clairvoyance to mortality
And we raise a word to utter
These fires so bright, we leave a farewell

Even if weâve met before,in dreams, space and time
What did we feel, on these poor and barren mortal grounds

By the story, when our ways depart
Now as we speak and mourn at your Final Sleep

Yet, somehow
Weâll meet again
And until then
Journey well
