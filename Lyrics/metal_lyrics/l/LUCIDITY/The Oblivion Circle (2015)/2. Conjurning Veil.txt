Aspire now, diving through divine pain
Traces of reality expanding when
We walked silently in our own thoughts
There was no grave to grant us rest

Still as conquerors of brave new worlds
As flowers ripped out from the dirt
We declared; "Cursed be the Dream!"
That allows us not to see
Cast a shadow over mankind and revealâ¦
...the dream!

As women searched their mothers and daughters
As men searched their fathers and sons
The unions of humanity, screaming, reaping fire
That burns in the heart of all who seek

To bear the flame, and burn the hollow temples
To keep the key, see a shallow world
To experience the water, to float to other levels
To hold the dagger, and stab the eyes of a blind god

To crush moulds, let the tidal waves of sacred blood flow
When absence proves the addictions
We left wondering, where we came from?
From stargardens of misery? And it will hurt, pain takes many disguises

Long deep tunnel, where from concrete walls
Light reflect from water drops
White faces twisted in grotesque paintings
Speak words from ancient mouths

And the light and the darkness
Where it shines from, is not end nor beginning
Yet from the source it is glowing through and within
Shattered and completed, something we call existence

And then we walk proud
Challenging death
To break the mirror
The renaissance beyond flesh
