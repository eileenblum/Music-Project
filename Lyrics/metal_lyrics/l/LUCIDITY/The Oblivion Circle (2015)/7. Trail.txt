Been staring the walls
So sick of all the poison
Chains within still binding
Stains of rust and aching cold

Divine ecstasy glowing shadow impulses
In the womb of mundane turmoil
The choice is ours to keep our demons
In absurd world like this

As fearmongers play their pitiful games
Nothing but weakness of this plane
Their master as the chains are chosen
Chains are chosen

And family shadows, they grow taller
Inside the central sun calm and still

Darkness donât keep us
Something within ourselves
Keeping blind addictions
In time and place and free of them

Walked through these fields
Still insecure I felt
Through the woods I ran
Just to get away from the sun

Never learning to live
In a world of light
Itâs enough to survive
In a world ruled by night

Through years of chaos
This trail made of wars
Refuse to follow the sign
Sworn nothing but death to all

Stain my hands with blood
Of the mindâs I touch

This trail made of death
Still waiting for more to take
And to feast on their mind
All humanity will forsake

Accept my force, my power
Fall under my will
