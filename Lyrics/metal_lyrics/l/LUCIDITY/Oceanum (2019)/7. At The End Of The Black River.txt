Here at the end of the black river
Mutual with despair are the movements
Now fallen o' lion of stars
Now silence dwell with waters

When it once bathed with the light
And still we don't see how the curtains are grim
Still we cannot see how the veil is thin
Here at the river and within

Face to face with fear of life
Face to face with death and time

Those years behind the shade
Pure and simple in absence of pain
Now without all the promises
Beneath this moon to wash away

Face to face with fear of life
Face to face with death and time

The dark turns darker, as one touch the river
The current is stronger, as life starts to wither

Afraid to fall free from the earthly pain
As the river whispers a name

And the waters, were clean at moonlight
When there was no, times will change
Leaving us to reach, the distant memories
Instead of this, this dark, this rust
