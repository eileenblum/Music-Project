Outside the snow is falling
Like a dance of ghost
Pale city lights hit the concrete
Like prayers in their ruins

Empty temples of hollow speech
Years serving the pain
Only walls observe the floating dust
Left to roam alone

Forsaken by the eyes
Of a cloud hidden moon
Behind the walls built so tall
Live to die for another sunrise

Of dreams, of realities
As one, and departed
Trapped in, collective masks
Of mankind's deathbed

Forsaken by the eyes
Of a cloud hidden moon
Behind the walls built so tall
Live to die for another sunrise
