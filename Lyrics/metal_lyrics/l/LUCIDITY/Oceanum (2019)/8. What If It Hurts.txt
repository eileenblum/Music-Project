You may not see through this old skin
Scars don't tell of the pain within
I know if won't act, it will just be worse
So tell me what if it hurts

I know where to hide my guilt and shame
And ignore the eyes that tell of pain
I stand back and wait when it burst
Yet look away 'cause what if it hurts

Show you my scars to see where you touched
For the cut runs too deep
If all my pain and guilt reverts
Still afraid what if it hurts
