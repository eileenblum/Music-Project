I feel pride overtaking me
And the fool I am
My ignorance is feeding me
And deny helping hand

The beauty won't be the same
After this reaches out
This demon whispers a name
That I can live without

It was me

All the lies I have told
I believed them all
With closed eyes I will grow old
And complete my wall

Within these walls my mind is clear
Don't need a helping hand
And to no one I will reveal
Still a fool I am

Just a name
I want to forget
Just a name
I can live without
