Leaves are falling, smoke follow there
Paint with rain, and lonely view
So the leaves fall, so does his soul
Without these shores, the ocean waits

Carved scars screams, this is where he drowns
In his thoughts, and his nightmares
Passed the haunting names, fears without words
All words he spoke, spoke them fast

Reflections are here, by endless forms
All his thoughts, within are quiet
And still are chanting, their dark songs
Floating away, yet still stay here

Keeping eyes, open while all others sleep
A tired man, search as the struggle goes on
Scars in ghosts, that dwell within too deep
Flashing light, like the beacon of death

Ghosts observing, lure him to pain unseen
Names of our fears, written in heart
And scarred for life

Inside these lives, no guilt too small
Underneath the ground, no hole too deep to fall
