The old clock ticks on
A second, a minute and the hour
And yet again
One year into the unknown

Then and now
Are they all wasted away?
Stare these strangers eyes
Observing the deep dark
Slowly falling clouds

A beating pulse, so calm, dew and rays
On this morning rise, gravity press me down
The gleam of days, years passed behind
The shade so strange, reality of my time

Turn to oblivion
So dim is the shine of all hope as my guide
In these crossroads
Aware of our fall below in our sleep

In our hearts
And all the lines are done with our blood
To the walls within
Not knowing where this road leads
Not knowing where it ends...

When it seems, like this is the fall
Like these are only new coming storms
I stare these strangers eyes
Face to face with the unknown

And borders of then and now
I have no doubt when it's dark inside
It is all the years passed by
Behind the reality of time

Cannot change one's history
Knowing what was supposed to be
Pushing me, pulling me

Want to speak yet there's no sound
Try to see through walls around
Borders of then and now
