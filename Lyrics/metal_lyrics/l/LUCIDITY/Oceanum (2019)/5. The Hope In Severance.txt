Before these lives are done
The time we took the earthly shapes
In the oil lamps flickering flames
Should we return to see our birth

The walk across the spirals of the earth
To illuminate many faces
And these phantom thoughts
While we learnt to speak and not toâ¦

...hear
Here is only few reasons
Endless stories and endless bridges burnt
Leads to...
...fall
Lonely rooms and more lonelier minds
In a distant mist of it all
...fall ...fall ...fall

Again we meet our fate, dressed in disguise
Standing grey at the gate, and lure us with lies
Behind this dark art, paint with colour of black
Borders of the lost, and the ones who can't come back

Dark canvas, faded paintings

Words without answers
Absence and remembrance
Hollow and futile
The hope in severance

And then the questions
To bind them all in
Unhuman interventions
Death welcome in

With pure radiant light of death
I take these demons to the grave
To the darkness where we all belong
Need no guide as we go along

...we all reek of fearâ¦
...we all reek of deathâ¦

We are no more
One of us
You are no more
One of us
Separated
From you
Separated
From us

Among the shadows
Of this dead world
Rushing in with fear
To cast a cry out far
Only sleeping statues
Receive the questions
Nothing we can choose
And all we shall lose

We are no more
One of us
You are no more
One of us
