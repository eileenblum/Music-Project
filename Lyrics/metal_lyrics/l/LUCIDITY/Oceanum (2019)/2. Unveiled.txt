Ravishing lights
They fall through a windowpane
Are they in their bleak illusion
Trapped inside the labyrinth

Of life, of death
Beyond and between
Like moths driven for the flame
In search for tranquility

...At least...
...Be it knownâ¦

The harvest of lifeforms
Million years now gone
Unveiling the truth
No more they shall be reborn

Gently pressed down
To the infinite cloak
Unveiling the truth
That the vermin was the sun

And while universe expands
And cycles repeat
Like moths driven for the flame
In chase for tranquility

Ravishing lights won't reach this waste
Still trapped in this maze
There's no light of day
These lives we lead
So dreadful to see

Before the blazing sun is broken
And the vermin's are erased
