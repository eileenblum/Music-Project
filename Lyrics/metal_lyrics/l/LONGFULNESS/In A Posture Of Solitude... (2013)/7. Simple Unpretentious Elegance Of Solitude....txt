For life is nothing but a reflection of solitudeâs end, giving purpose to a hope and an isolated light in an abyss of ignoranceâ
For a brief moment we must fly into a dream to fall deep into our subconscious, glimpsing for a yearning soul alike
For hearts that are united through the medium of sorrow will not be separated by the glory of happinessâ
But do not mourn the search for nothing, in accepting silence it slowly becomes a part of the speech. âBut is silence more painful than death?â

âI believed death to be a phenomenon of the body. Now I know it to be merely a function of the mind"

To study to the order of things to try to understand/grasp their innermost essence, for Iâm only the ignorant to my own oblivion

A caterpillar can only turn into a beautiful flying butterfly, when it locks itself in a cocoon of utmost solitude.
