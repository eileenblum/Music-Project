Bury the dead (right sided) as a symbol of acceptance in paradise. Devour sorrow with a distorted vision of heaven and oblivion that is the end
Letâs dream of oblivion, maybe it gives some sensation that life is ours to behold. But only in mirrors of desolation's unknown speech
In desolation we try to understand sadness in a melody of despair, where the noble quest of its spirit is only known at the end
Where we can only see the distant light of the notes; presenting comfort for a moment, a brief moment of realization

In accepting struggle as a part of the journey in an aura of self-actualization, we can visualize the end of the beginning
In longfulness we must remember lust and past misery. We must climb the mountain so we can ride it down âWilliam Faulkner

The ability to sing in minor notes with such depth that enables a major smile of relief, is the bottom of a paradiseâs essenceâ¦ so we run while we sing in an abstract picture from a dream I yearn to exist

The very first action taken by a child in order to breathe in life is to weep; a concept that makes joy an extension of lament and paradise an extension of misery.
