To discover my own solitude in the indifference of others, to draw a portrait of sightless insight
Just an intoxicated insomnia of a life untold

I long for the nostalgic echo of my silent screams denied,
In the comforting nothingness of my subconscious delirium only a bate;
To the hook of my nightmare awake, in a posture of solitude:
For the passing fragile consumed laughter endâ¦ Lamentations in nourishment
