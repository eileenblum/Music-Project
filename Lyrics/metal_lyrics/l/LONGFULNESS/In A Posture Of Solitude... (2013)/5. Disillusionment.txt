Dive in a pool of silence where the muscles stop, eyes close and a mere feeling of light. Then inhale the air into a prayerâ¦
To do something that the mind cannot anticipate, negatively;
But humanely correct in its essenceâ¦
Where instead of dreaming of an alternative reality, Iâll make mineâ¦
To sleep into an ease of mind, emptiness of heart and longfulness of theeâ¦
To bury all the un-fulfilled desire s into the well on which the human heart screams in agonyâ¦
For tomorrow only lies an orbit, to take me back to a dream I refuse to finish
Atmosphere falls upon me like rain on an Ice-mold that is my life,
To dissolve into an angel behind a coat of snowy restlessness divine
Disillusionmentâ¦
