Dreams reflect what reality lacks, an initiative to do the desired
But sometimes dreams reflect on the inner-darkness,
A void buried in a river of you
(So Iâll)
Find solace in tears un-poured in thy self, fears of dreams that haunt my spirit â¦ (Diminishes in the comfort of her sweetest embrace), a sole hope in the blackest of the skies dawned. Only to find;
That âherâ is only an echo of my silent screamsâ¦ denied
Restlessnessâ¦
