"In an act of self-mutilation, onto his own body. In the writing, heâ¦. is already in the tomb that his memoirs represent."
Forever endeavourâ¦ for just a yearning moment of an embrace

I remain a virgin in nostalgia of threats of rapeâ¦
The un-loved by the subconscious delirium of hope
The un-social norm of imprisonment of social conduct
The random mind by an unbreakable chain of notice
The silent dweller in my trust of my own idealism, only inhumanly human
To me and those around me, the mitigated of a heart remain (Iâm only an echo)
I'm a man who accepts the dark side of human nature
And for all my endeavors to the never-ending-scream
Of cynicism's tale, only untold ( a mere echo)
[0:30 till the end of the intro]

"In an act of self-mutilation, onto his own body. In the writing, heâ¦. is already in the tomb that his memoirs represent."
Forever endeavourâ¦
