Well concealed my human destitution
Shroud of endless void within

A shadowed figure
A lone failure
Shameful posture
Shy disciple of darkness
A fool to decay in ever-cold

All scripts of life unknown
Unheard
Unseen
All breath to give in to (dark) spiritual formulae

In grief
Placid
The world surrounding shatters
Obsessed by ill consumption

Possessed and inclined to enter this covetous passing

True and bitter with my destiny
The wish of death

Be real!
