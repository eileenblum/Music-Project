If you saw the darkness before death
Life fading before its last breath
Then you would know
If you saw life without hope, death without reason
Then you would know

Then you would know
The meaning of fear
Watching them live is killing me
Living on my time
Self sacrifice
Worth the loss of life
I would shed infinite rivers of blood to paint a portrait of disgust with yours
Reveal your true colors, murder you and take back hope stolen from me
To see your reflection, but only as skin deep
To feel the shallow pulse of omnipotent sadness
My ritual silent
My ritual alone
Alone

Curtains I am closing
Infinity drowned
Darkness my crown
Never to resist
This is my sacrifice
I close my eyes
I'll make my fucking deathwish be real!
