I have seen it so clearly
Everyday on my screen
It's the future that scares me
And worse it will be

They are disease
I have the cure
Delete the defected
Don't let it grow, don't let it grow.

Wash away the filth
Let them all pay the price
Taste my medicine
It's an eye for an eye
Revenge is fair
When it's justified
Can't imagine tears
On the day you die.

I walk among madmen
That should be in the ground
They say I'm the sick one
What the hell have I done
