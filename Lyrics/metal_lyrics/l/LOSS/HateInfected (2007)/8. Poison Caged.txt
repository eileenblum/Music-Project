Welcome to the world of nothing
We are reckless, extreme
Euphoric discomfort
Ebola for the mainstream

Silent walls, hopeless souls
Brains erased, poison caged

Entangled within mysteries
Demented dancing at dawn
Now we are no more inside
Embody an alien design

Within the darkest soul
Death becomes sure
Friends are for the weak
Death is the cure

Senses bereft, no sanity left
Merciless pain for the insane

Take things to a different level
Never mind to bullshit us
Spawn a breed of moron bastards
Sorrow buried in our loss
