Empty eyes cold as ice
Human bomb lost in lies
Innocent blood shall pour
Reign of hate, holy gore

Blow yourself to the grave
Suicide, mental slave
Brutal death, shrapnel flies
Shredding flesh, children dies

Endless terror strikes again
Morbid bastards master plan

Obnoxious and decadent
Ferocious begotten
Mentally lost, they are set to explode
Breeding the spawn so their brains will corrode
Mind rotting cowards plays God on demand
Martyrs immortal in fantasy land

Cruel device, heaven sent
Warped insane, mortal bent
Executes cryptic faith
Hollow fools detonates

So religion made you blind
Now your coffin suits you fine
