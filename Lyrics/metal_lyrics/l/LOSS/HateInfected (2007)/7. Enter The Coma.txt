Trapped in this morbid place
Odd symptoms of the human race
Increasingly ensnared
You can't avoid despair

Enter the coma, holy repentance
Your life is over, carnal indulgence

The road to eternity
Is paved with misery
You've got a soul to sell
The seventh level of hell

Beyond this realm
Destructive cult
They've come to terms, and crawl like worms
A constant state, of covert hate
Who will be slain?
A world insane

Insidious mind control
Metamorphose your soul
Mutated into dreams
Fall prey to the extreme

Cathedral for the weird
The preacher spreading fear
The final act of blunt relief
Leaves you permanent deceased
