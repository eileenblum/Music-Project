Your soul is devoted to Jesus
Cause you are weak in mind
I stake out my own way
Instead of listen to lies
I don't need any religion
To set up my rules
I rather walk alone in darkness
Than to be among you fools

Blinded you are, afraid of hell
Restrained you are, but full of faith

You devote your life to your savior
The blind leads the blind
You have never experienced anger
I hate you and your kind

Blinded you are, afraid of hell
Restrained you are, but full of faith
The world is filled with brainwashed ghosts
No heaven exists, you are deceived by the cross

They have become your family
You think they help you if you fall
They are the ones you should stay away from
To make you weaker is their goal
Stop being paralyzed and open up your eyes
Why should you stay away from sin
Why do you let them control your life

Blinded you're not, not afraid of hell
You're not restrained, you broke the chains
The world is filled with brainwashed ghosts
You're not one of them cause you broke your cross

Blinded you're not, not afraid of hell
You're not restrained, you broke the cross
