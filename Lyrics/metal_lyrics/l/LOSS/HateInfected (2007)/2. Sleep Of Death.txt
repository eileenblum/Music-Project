Bathing in scarlet showers
And pools of dripping blood
This place has no tomorrow
There cannot be a God

How can we live this hell
Who will be left to tell

The horror that befell us
Betrayed by vicious fate
Hatred and endless terror
Repentance is too late

They twist and torture reality
Into the dark shape of horror

Lost in the maddening crowd
Another corpse to shroud
Remission of all sins
Take heed, now death begins

And with the final breath your life is gone
Welcome to eternity my son
This is the place where we belong
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

Searching for life fulfillment
A human density
And time is an illusion
Death is your destiny
