In this time of darkness I have lost all will to live
As the end approaches and the night is closing in
The madness of religion supports insanity
This is the new order, death for eternity

Born to suffer we're living a lie
Endless violence, infernal we die

The justice of the world, fool for a fool
Power to the strong, here money rules
Tyranny of Gods, leads morbid minds
Circus of the mad, decay of mankind

BLOOD, HATE, DEATH...

In this time of hatred all insanity explodes
Existence is a nightmare when agony unfolds
Cruel retaliation escalates the war
A brutality in murder you've never seen before
