Detonate me and feel my sorrow
I have reached the abyss again
Shadows lurking and want to swallow
The feeble flame I still have

Cryptic visions dwells inside me
You are not entitled to the truth
How can you long for a new tomorrow
When the curse has chosen you

Anguish, I'm bleeding, I'm fragile and torn
There is no believing left in my soul
Where is the end that I've been waiting for
Closing my eyes to follow the reaper's call

Resurrect my collapsed system
Let me be able to feel again
I'm colored black inside, hate infected
I will always belong to the damned
