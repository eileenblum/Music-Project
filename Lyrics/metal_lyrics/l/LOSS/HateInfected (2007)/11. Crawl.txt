Their dead eyes stare at me
Bringing me agony
They try to infiltrate
Trying to leach me and dominate

Silence, don't speak to me
Horror, is what I feel
Forsaken, I stand alone
Darkness, all around
This is everlasting
But I will never fall
You won't see that day
In front of you I crawl

You managed to destroy
Other people's lives
I'm not one of the weak
So you have to step aside

Listen, as I speak to you
Wake up, this is the truth
Forsaken, you'll always be
Darkness, your eternity
This is everlasting
But I will never fall
You won't see that day
In front of you I crawl
