Well I'm mourning now, I'm hating, meet my anger, sorrow
I'm searching for what I need I'm using, acting

My weird mind controls me
Entertains me and depresses me
Fear some scare some
It will kill some, will it kill me?

I'm searching for my inner understanding, selfishness makes me 
Satisfied, stronger, I'm detestable, cumbersome

Violent thoughts are cleansing
Smelling it will touch your greed
Loneliness is happiness
Best friend, my self

Reach inside, empty soul, tear apart, molest myself
Feeling strong, powerful, Sovereign, free of choice

Reaching for my throat, strangles with itself
Tearing me apart, finally I'm one

Silence, emptiness
Happiness, restlessness
Feeling free, left alone
Hating me, hating none

Smell of fear, comes to me
Getting aroused, starts to need
Starts to hate, starts to live
Will end it, death will give

Hate, underestimated, Anger makes you focused
Begging, weak, revenge will feed your needs

Never think of others, never compromise
Set your self at first, Self seeking, on your own

Tearing me apart, finally I'm one
Found myself, finally I'm one
