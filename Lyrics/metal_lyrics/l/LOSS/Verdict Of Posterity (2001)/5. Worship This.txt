When I show my skills to the world, everybody is amazed
I'm the champion of the human race, the winner of the race

Leading, leader of the people 
Master, master of the world 
King, the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 

Everybody wants to be me, see the world through my eyes 
They all want to be worshipped, feel the glory every day 

Leading, leader of the people 
Master, master of the world 
King, the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 

Kicks down on my slaves who feed me 
Murder everyone who stands up to me 
Torture is my way of leading 
Worship, worship me 

Leading, leader of the people 
Master, master of the world 
King, the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 

Kicks down on my slaves who feed me 
Murder everyone who stands up to me 
Torture is my way of leading 
Worship, worship me 

I rule my people with their fear, I'm playing god for fun 
Their agony gets things done for me, their pain is what I own 

Leading, leader of the people 
Master, master of the world 
King, the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 

Kicks down on my slaves who feed me 
Murder everyone who stands up to me 
Torture is my way of leading 
Worship, worship me
