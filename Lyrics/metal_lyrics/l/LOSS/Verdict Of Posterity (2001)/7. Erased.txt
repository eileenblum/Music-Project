I fight for my right to destroy my body, I torture my body the way I feel
Needles and pills I use all I want, with razors I stab myself bleeding out
Spilling my vain makes my life brighter, draining my body from years of black
Anaesthetized I seem almost normal, with drugs in my veins I'm stronger to all

Using, using everything I got
Carving my arms to forget

Forget everything I've seen, the past will be
Erased from my mind, drained with chemicals
No one shall call me useless, even if that is what I am
They aren't got the right to reject, just because I've choose this way

Using, using everything I got
Carving my arms to forget

Forget everything I've seen, the past will be
Erased from my mind, drained with chemicals
The day I die will be my first day, and freedom is what I prepare
My chains shall be broken by poison, the poison I inhale for emptiness

Using, using everything I got
Carving my arms to forget

Forget everything I've seen, the past will be
Erased from my mind, drained with chemicals
