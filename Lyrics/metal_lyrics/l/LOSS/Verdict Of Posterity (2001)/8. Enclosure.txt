The first time I came close to death was in the beginning of my change
The reaction of my body stroke my soul like nothing else

Senselessness mends all that's weak
The pain I felt pushed me to seek

Tortured by my past I went just deeper in my vain
Strength by what I found I couldn't wait to see the end 

The dark side of mentality
Deeper than all I have seen

Weed, rest, waste, gone
Stab, blow, choke, free

Reached the gate

I reign my end with possibilities of making it original
The greater I fall into sleep remembrance increase

Sacrifice of life to be 
Remembered to those left behind

Weed, rest, waste, gone
Stab, blow, choke, free
