Find a place for them to feel safe, lock them up away from us
Beat them with fists and bats, tear them down to make them ours
Their thoughts aren't what we approve of, can't give them back their
rights
Our way is the right way, follow us or die

Haunting, aiming
Have fun with their fear
Bleeding, begging
No life is to spare

Leaders of the world
Takes no chances, enemies will bleed
Steals the life of the weak
Our way will conquer

Can't allow the wrong opinion, won't allow for them to speak
Rips their tongues out of their mouths, free in speech we don't believe

Haunting, aiming
Have fun with their fear
Bleeding, begging
No life is to spare

Leaders of the world
Takes no chances, enemies will bleed
Steals the life of the weak
Our way will conquer

The race will be all the same, everyone will be the same
Weed by choosing the right men, killing the one who's left in the end

Haunting, aiming
Have fun with their fear
Bleeding, begging
No life is to spare
