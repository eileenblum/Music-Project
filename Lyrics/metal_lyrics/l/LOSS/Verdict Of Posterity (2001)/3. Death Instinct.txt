I've lost my mind to others, lost my senses to, all that's left is
instincts for me
So don't tell me I'm psycho, you can't judge my deeds, all I'm doing is
following my needs

My inheritance is leading me
All I'm doing is for me, death duty

Forces leading me, demanding all my acts, no mind left to tell me wrong
You don't judge beasts for killing, say it's in its genes, the same
genes is running me

The smell of blood wakes all senses
Leading me in my dismemberment

The haunting still arouses me
One step closer to damnation
Getting stronger, standing on my own
Rejecting weakness, I am the leading soul

Making my way through, permissive living, the choices I make is based on
myself
All the killing is, of necessity, my death instinct is leading me

The number of acts is nothing
The instinct of death is everything

The haunting still arouses me
One step closer to damnation
Getting stronger, standing on my own, I am the leading soul
Rejecting weakness, I am the leading soul
