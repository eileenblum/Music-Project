I say my life is over, all seems to point that way
My senses all are dead, I'm leaning for disgrace

Feeling like a corpse 
My body, wasted source
Falling down to my rest
Finally I've reached what's me

I'm told my hope is no more, I can't care less
I've lived my life for this day, this one-day was my goal 

Final, this I like
No life, the end is here
Falling down to my rest
Finally I've reached what's me

Some people will hail this day, the day all their hate die
Relief's from years of disdain, I will reveal their luck

No more times of rage
The butcher has met his grave
Falling down to my rest
Finally I've reached what's me
