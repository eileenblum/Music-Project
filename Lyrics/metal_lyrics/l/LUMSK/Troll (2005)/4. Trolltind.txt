Vilja du hÃ¸yra historia
om Trolltindane i Romsdal?
det gjekk seg slik at dei vart te'
da jotnane skulle gifta seg

-og brurefÃ¸lgjet seg pÃ¥ ferda

GiftarmÃ¥let skulle stÃ¥
i trollkyrkja som var deira
ved foten av fjellet Romsdalshorn
alle jotnane skulle feira

Nokre av jotnane kom langvegs frÃ¥
og starta tidleg med festen
Ã¸lbollen vandra i ring blant dei
som gjekk pÃ¥ den brurevei

-og tida ho blei ikkje lange

Tida var glÃ¸ymd og natta blei lang
dei spÃ¸kte og lo og fnisa
dess meir dei supa og lo og song
dei nÃ¦rma seg umerkeleg krisa

Det tura i lag
og natt blei til dag
men med dagslyset kom ogsÃ¥ sola
det Ã¸yeblikk strÃ¥lane fÃ¸lgjet traff
var det ikkje blant oss her pÃ¥ jorda

Ikkje ein jotne held seg pÃ¥ beina
fÃ¸lgjet blei som forsteina
det hjelpte ikkje Ã¥ verte gal
dei stÃ¥r der den dag i dag

[English translation:]

Troll Peak

Will you hear the story
Of the Troll Peaks in Romsdal?
It was so that they were created
When giants were to get married

-And the bride's following was on its way

The marriage was to be held
In the troll-church that was theirs
At the base of the mountain Romsdalshorn
All giants would celebrate

Some of the giants came from afar
And started the feast early
The beer-bowl was passed around amongst them
That were on the marriage way

-And time went fast

Time was forgotten and the night was long
They joked and laughed and giggled
And the more they drank and laughed and sang
They approached indiscernible crisis

They tripped in company
And night became day
But with daylight also came sun
The moment the rays caught the following
They were not with us here on earth

No giant stayed on his feet
The following was as petrified
It didnât help to be mad
They stand there still today.
