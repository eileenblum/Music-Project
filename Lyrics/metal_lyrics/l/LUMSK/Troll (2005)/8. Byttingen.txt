Byttingen satt der i godstolen sin
sur og sÃ¦r ved grua
gamal og taus og rugga seg
alle Ã¸nskte at han skulle dÃ¸y
ogsÃ¥ nabofrua

Han var sÃ¥ gamal og taus ein kar
dei spurde vismannen
og han gav svar:
"om byttingen sei dykk kor gamal han e'
vil han dÃ¸y - det e' de som skal te"

Byttingen ville ikkje daude, han ville leva evig

Byttingen satt der i god stolen sin
sur og sÃ¦r ved grua
vismannen tok seg eit eggeskal
og lot som han skulle bryggja Ã¸l
og servere det til frua

Byttingen vakna med eitt sÃ¥ glad
stirde pÃ¥ Ã¸lbrygget rugga og sa:
"lenge har eg levd og sju gonger sett
skogen brenna og vekse opp
Men aldri Ã¸lbrygg i ein eggeskaltopp"

byttingen ville ikkje daude, han ville leva evig

No var det dags for han og dÃ¸y, han ville leva evig

[English translation:]

The Changeling

The changeling sat in his favourite chair
Grumpy and angry by the fireplace
Old and silent and rocked himself
Everybody wanted him dead
Even the neighbour's wife

He was so old and silent a man
They asked the wiseman
And he gave them answer:
"If the changeling tells you how old he is
He will die - that is what must be done"

The changeling didnât want to die, he wanted to live forever

The changeling sat in his favourite chair
Grumpy and angry by the fireplace
The wiseman took an eggshell
And pretended to brew ale
And serve it to the wife

The changeling awoke so merry
Stared at the ale-brew rocked and said:
"Longly have I lived and seven times seen
The forest burn down and grow up again
But never ale-brew in an eggshell-cup "

The changeling didnât want to die, he wanted to live forever

Now it was time for him to die, he wanted to live forever
