[Music: Christian - Theon Lyrics: Theon]

Oh how the mighty fall
Turn the stone to find another world
All the roads we've roamed with pride
Decay under our steps of fright
Fall, oh how the mighty fall
The glory fades too soon
I fear the good becomes the fear
Our story ends too soon
I saw it all begin so well
But it's our virtues that they sell
And so you won the war
Shot down everything living for
