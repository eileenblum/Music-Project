[Music: Vivian - Theon - Christian - Janne Lyrics: Vivian - Theon - Janne]

Through the darkness and broken glass
I'll come for you, if you only ask
And there I'll stand
Just for you
Million miles between our lives
can't keep us apart from our grieving hearts
sealed with love
God speed my darling
For your name
I'm calling
For our love
I'm falling... on my knees
And if you cry, I'll hold your head up high
I'll be there by your side
I will be your guardian angel
And if you cry, I'll hold your head up high
I'll be there by your side
I will be your guardian angel
In the garden of lonely love
I'll wait for you, 'till the time will come
When i see you smile
Just for me
Love and loss embrace the pain
You can't hide your tears in the rain
I'll be there
Just wait my darling
And if you cry, I'll hold your head up high
I'll be there by your side
I will be your guardian angel
And if you cry, I'll hold your head up high
I'll be there by your side
I will be your guardian angel
I will do the things that I can to light your life and see you smile
And it brakes my heart in two...
'til I see you smile
just for me
'til I hear you breath
calm and free
and until you sleep
I won't let you grieve
