[Music: Christian - Theon - Sammy Lyrics: Theon]

Look into these eyes I've seen the same
Death won't spare us from the shame
Buy more hours by forgetting who's to blame
I see the pictures
They're all gone
You crossed the line you don't belong
Let down your game
Do you feel the same
As I miss true harmony
No way...
....Bullet for the pain
You roll the dice
Release my hell
Rebel in eyes that will never tell
To me you're not the only one to feel redemption
Prophecies merge into seeds
Growing only to crush our dreams
Let down your game
