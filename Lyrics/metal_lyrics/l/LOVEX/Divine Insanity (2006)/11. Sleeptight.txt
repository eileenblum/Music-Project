[Music &amp; lyrics: Theon]

Forget all your worries
The bleeding and suffering
Let your mind rest and live a little more
Forget all your worries
Those wounds and the stumbling
Leave all your bullets to the sidelines
Oh how the lights suddenly disappear
And the world falls asleep to the sound of angels singing
The prettiest symphony
And life lies halfway to the night
Forget all your worries
Remorse and insanity
Just close your eyes
And sleep tightâ¦zzzzâ¦zzzzâ¦zzzzâ¦zzzz
