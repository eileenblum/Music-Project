[Music: Sammy - Theon - Christian - Jussi Lyrics: Theon]

Looking down at the ground to hide
the sorrow drawn on your face
Speaking words from your dreams to disguise
the lies painted in your mind
I'm your pain
you are my hurt
Take me as I am
Believe I am yours
Listening to angels singing to fade
Your screams echoing in my ears
Watching the sun for too long just to
blind myself from the mirror
