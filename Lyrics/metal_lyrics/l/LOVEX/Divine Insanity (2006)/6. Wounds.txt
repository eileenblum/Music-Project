[Music: Christian - Theon Lyrics: Theon]

Too much, too long
Fighting to heal the wounds
You made walking away
Sinking deeper
Trying to deal with the hurt
Haunting in my dreams
Too many times I've walked in the shadows on a Saturday night
Too many times I've lost my soul fighting to find it
I'm drifting away
My heart beats in
Silent sounds of loneliness
I fear that no one can hear
When I'm running away
To maintain my sanity
It's all too real
For me trying to feel
Too much, too long
I've waited here for you
To finally come back home
Endless, senseless
Reaching for the hand
Too far for me to touch
