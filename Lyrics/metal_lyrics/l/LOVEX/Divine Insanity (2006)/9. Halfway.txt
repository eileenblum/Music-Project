[Music: Theon - Sammy Lyrics: Theon]

This time I'll make you see
That I've pushed myself so someone could free me
I'm coming your way girl
I can't wait till time gets me
Long years in the funny farm
I lost control, I drive eyes blinded
And the only voice I hear is your song
Playing on my stereo
Streets from my golden days
Have turned into sand but the dust can't choke me
I close the window praying
God, bring her closer to me
Sweet body and eyes like steel
Are getting vague but I wanna hold on to my memories
And all the shit you did
Doesn't matter 'cause I know you did it knowing that I knew you'd do it
Ooooâ¦
I'm only here to catch a star
Ooooâ¦
Still standing halfway to your heart
Don't deny me
This time I won't back out
There's no wall thick enough to stop me
Snakes won't slow my down
My mind's made up baby
No room for a second chance
I broke my brakes I ride like the thunder
Will you take me in your arms
Or push me off the cliff, I wonder?
What am I supposed to do now My situation is hardly what I wished for
Well I guess I'll back my bags
'cause here I go again I'm coming baby get ready
