[Music: Christian - Theon Lyrics: Theon]

I had my chance
You gave it away
I didn't say enough
I did too much
And everytime I look back in time I find myself questioning why
I'm deep in despair
Deep down in my mind
I relive the time
When all could have been more than I've seen, when all could have been mine, all mine
Just if I
If I could sleep by your side
I would run through the night
Hold you so right
Hold the most beautiful sight
Standing on the sidelines
Careless and afraid
Don't dare to think
What possessed my way
And everytime I look back in time I find myself questioning why
Just yesterday
I thought I knew
All the words to say
When all could have been more than I've seen, when all could have been mine, all mine
