[Music : Sammy - Vivian - Theon Lyrics : Theon Orchestra arrangements : Christian - Vivian]

I left my soul behind
I grew my conscience blind
Loved my self too much
to handle the truth
I had to ease my blues
I turned my back on you
And now I feel no pain
I have no fears
But still i feel I'm
Loosing touch with...
life...For I'm trough, I'm alone
inside my heart of stone
And it's you, it's you
Inside my heart of stone
I felt so bad for so long
I thought my heart would grow strong
But all my hope was
buried with your goodbyes
