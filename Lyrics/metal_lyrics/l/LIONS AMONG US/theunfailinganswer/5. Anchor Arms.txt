[Verse]
Hollow out my chest.
Then, you can see how I truly feel
I may not have it all figured out,
But Iâm striving for something real.
These bones are brittle
but my spirit will not be shaken
for I hold the keys
to a life the world has forsaken.

[Chorus:]
Spend you whole life striving for meaning
That was staring you right in the face.
Who would have known that with just one spark
Weâd tear the roof right off this place
No longer will I stay broken
Like the way that I was in the past
I will take the time that I have left
And I will try to make it last

[Verse 2]
How much faster does your heart beat
When youâre six feet under ground

[Breakdown]

Drive drive drive till I get it home
I wont stop till every one knows
This is the reason why im alive
This is the reason why I deal with all the pain thatâs inside

No longer will I hide my faith
Like a skeleton from my past
While most things fade away
Iâll show you one thing that will last

This is who I am.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I will try to make it last.

[Break down]

What is life with out passion?
What is life without love?
