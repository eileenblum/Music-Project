[Verse:]
Iâm so sick of all the apathy
That surrounds this generation.
But if we all could stand as one
We would shake the whole foundation.

[Chorus:]
I think Itâs time see what dreams are made of.
Youâve only got one chance.
Now is our time. Rise up and make a stand
It all comes down to LOVE.

[Verse 2]
Iâm so sick of hearing my voice fall on deaf ears
Its time to wake up! Wake up!
Our voice could move the mountains
And watch them fall into the sea

[Breakdown]

Itâs time to wake up the walking dead.

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]

This is our time.
Key change

[Chorus]
