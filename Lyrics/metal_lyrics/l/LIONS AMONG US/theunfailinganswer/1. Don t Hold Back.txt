[Verse:]
Iâve fallen down more than you will ever know.
Iâm not a saint but Iâm trying to be.
It's from the ashes that I will rise
And take the steps back to change my life.

[Pre-Chorus:]
This is my chance to show you true love

[Chorus:]
Jump donât stay
You donât have to worry again
And all the things that I planned
I meant every word I said
Take a stand
You will have to fight for what you love
And all that itâs gonna be.
I promise that there is hope

[Breakdown:]
I'm not mindless
I am a martyr
But let's not be led
like sheep to the slaughter

[Verse:]
They may call you a failure, failure
Saying things like, "youâll never mean anything".
Here's a note written just for you
To me you mean everything

[Pre-Chorus:]
This is my chance to show you true...

[Chorus:]
Jump donât stay
You donât have to worry again
And all the things that I planned
I meant every word I said
(Love)
Take a stand
You will have to fight for what you love
And all that itâs gonna be.
I promise that there is hope

[Piano bridge]

Jump donât stay
You donât have to worry again
And all the things that I planned
I meant every word I said
Take a stand
You will have to fight for what you love
And all that itâs gonna be.
I promise that there is hope

[Breakdown]

[Chorus:]
Jump donât stay
You donât have to worry again
And all the things that I planned
I meant every word I said
Take a stand
You will have to fight for what you love
And all that itâs gonna be.
I promise that there is hope
