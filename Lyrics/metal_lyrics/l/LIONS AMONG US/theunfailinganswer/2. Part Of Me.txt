[originally by Katy Perry]Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus:]
This is the part of me
That youâre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That youâre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But youâre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youâre never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]

Now look at me Iâm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
Iâm glowinâ, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
I never liked it anyway
In fact you can keep everything yeah
Except for me

[Chorus]

This is the part of me
That youâre never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That youâre never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows
But youâre not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That youâre never gonna ever take away from me, no
