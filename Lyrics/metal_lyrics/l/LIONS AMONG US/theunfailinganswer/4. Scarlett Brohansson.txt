[Verse]
Thereâs a battle inside my head
Between the man I am and the man I need to be
I donât think I can handle this alone
I need someone to set me free

[Chorus:]
There is hope there is light in this world
I just need to get this one point straight
Though I stumble in the darkness
I refuse to be kept down today
So stand up for this life your living
You just need to get this one point straight
Youâre not worthless. Your life has meaning
Come with me weâll live just for today

[Verse]
Youre not worthless
So heres your chance to make things right
To trade your hate for love on the inside

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]
