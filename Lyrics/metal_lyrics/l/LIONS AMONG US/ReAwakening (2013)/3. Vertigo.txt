If I were honest with you,
This is the darkest I have ever been.
I never thought that I could end up like this!
Feeling of no hope
In the depths of all the darkest pits
Separated I find me alone
This is where I walk away.
I'm disappointed in the man I've grown to be.
This where I walk away
I cannot settle for less than everything
I never thought that I would find myself this way
I'm falling faster, falling faster
In a blink I start to slowly fade away
This who I've grown to be.
No, this can't be me
The silence is overwhelming
All I need is to be set free
And you hold the key
This is my everlasting dream This is my everything
This is my everlasting dream I will carry the flame
This is where I take a stand.
I'm done. I won't fall by my own hand.
This is where I take a stand.
No longer will I take life for granted.
I never thought that I would find myself this way
I'm falling faster, falling faster
But it's led me right to where I need to be
This who I really am.
I'm finding out
That love is all that I need
Through selflessness
I have been set free.
This is my greatest fear and I am leaving it here. [2x]
