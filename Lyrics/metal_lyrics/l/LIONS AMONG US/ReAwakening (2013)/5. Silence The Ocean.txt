I am sick and tired of everything
Though its been said before many times and many ways
Violence brings violence
And hate breeds hate.
When will we stand as one
And find another way
Stop waiting on the world to change.
I'm giving up on selfishness
And picking up the pieces of all the damage left
When will we stand and say enough is enough
When will we finally realize there is nothing greater than our love?
Without a jump, there is no fall.
But without hope we have lost it all
I see no end in sight
If all we ever do is fight
We've got to find a better way
Stop waiting for the world.
Stop waiting on the world to change
I'm giving up on selfishness
And picking up the pieces of all the damage left
So this is where the story stands
Will we stand as one or let it fall right through our hands?
This is me screaming right at you
This is the sound of silence
