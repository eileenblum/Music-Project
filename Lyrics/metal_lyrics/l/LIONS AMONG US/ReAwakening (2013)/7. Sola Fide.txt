This is the pain
And Iâve felt it for days.
Itâs ripping my heart in two.
Searching for another sound.
Canât put my feet back on the ground.
Are you listening?
I never thought that I would see this happening
But even through the darkest nights
There was one shining light
To take away the pain
Desperate for answers
And the quest for something better
Was all that I could seek
Though Iâd fallen through the spaces
In the darkest of places
You never let go of me.
This is the truth and I've found it in you
This wont be my final bow
Death and decay or the sting of the grave
Canât touch me now
These are the answers to all of the questions I never found in me.
That it's by your grace that I have been saved I have been set free
And so, I will scream with everything til there's no breath left in me
Jesus your name is all that I need.
You have set.
You have set me free.
