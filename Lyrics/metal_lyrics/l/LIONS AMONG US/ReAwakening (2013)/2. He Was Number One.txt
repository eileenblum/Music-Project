I've got something to say here
This won't be the death of me
I know I've said this all before
But it deserves repeating

This place is full of broken hearts
And empty promises that tear us apart.

This is my call out to a generation
With no regard for abomination.

We are the cause, the sickness and the cure.
This is the truth, the hope that we've been longing for.

You are worth.
So much more.
You are beautiful
Loved and adored

These words and hate they spew
Say nothing about the real you
This is my offering
Cause to me you still mean everything
Your existence is not meaningless
You are not insignificant.
And so Iâll scream until everyone knows
That love is real.
And there is still hope.
