[feat. Gage Speas of To Speak Of Wolves]Say what you want about me
Youâll never bring me down
The choice is mine.
The choice is clear
Weâll tear it to the ground
These hands were made to fight
Your eyes were meant to fear.
This is my calling
The reason That I've been put here
Cast your stone
One day youâll learn this world is not your own
Whereâs your throne?
Your fake humility will leave you alone
Iâve held my tongue now for far too long
And I can promise you tonight there will be blood.
I never dreamed that I would see the day
That I would find my fear staring face to face
Now I can believe. Now I believe
A revolution's all I need.
You talk a big game
With nothing real to back it up
This is my chance
Say that to my face, punk.

[Gage:]
I will never be silent
This is my destiny.
We are the revolution
The next awakening.
We've past the point of no return.
Grab the torches; let the fire burn.
This is my life I've held these words for long enough.
And I will never give up. I will never stop
This is all Iâll ever know.
This is my fight:
No greater Love!
