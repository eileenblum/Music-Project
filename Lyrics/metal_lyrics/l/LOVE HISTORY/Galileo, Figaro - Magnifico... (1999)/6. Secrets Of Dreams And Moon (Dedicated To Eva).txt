Now again my world is out of our space
after heartbreaking parting a looking for has became!
Now I'm walking alone across a history of love empire,
only my memories
have remained, those that make my heart to shed the tears!

These tears are the medicine for my heart
and my hurt feelings suffer from pain!

I hear your steps disappear, somewhere,
but my blood is still boiling in my veins.
