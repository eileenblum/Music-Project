It's the most powerful and the most beautiful, graceful,
pretty and the most faithful, right and steady love what you had been keeping to your blood.

It is describing with the pain within its heart the betrayal having veiled that blue sky with an
array of the sorrow and suffering.

Tears in the eyes ill become it.
Heart - breaking cry,
ill becomes it as well.
So, change this cruelty, anger
and your inner woe.
This lovely feeling deserves.
