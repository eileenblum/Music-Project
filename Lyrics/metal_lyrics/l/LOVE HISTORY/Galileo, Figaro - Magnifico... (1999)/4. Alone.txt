Those thousands of little stars
that I descry every night,
scattered in the endless sky when it's veiled
into a habit of temptation,
when it brings the unexchangeable excitement
it offers me its beautiful face.

So secret and enshrouded with the curtain of darkness
so lovely, but yet rather mysterious that face seeming
known for my mind had existed since the ancient ages.
That face that's an image faithful to the gleam of midnight sky.
One thought has sized my mind just now where
I have beheld this exquisite face.
I have dropped down my eyes towards your face
and I've been seeing a bright.

Shine which suggests the gleam of midnight sky to me again!!!
