Echoes of the black beast's roar
Fusion of blood and water
Industrial changes pulse
The black in eyes
The pins in veins
Parody of love
Comedy in the lost century
at a tail of the meaningless comet
Cold eyes of icons
as dreadful as all the darkest demons
Shackles of grief
Chains of would-be freedom
Game of masculine
Game of lust
Unrest, emptiness
Glowing flower, the Moon and the stellar fields,
though with no respect to that magic harmony
Pompous entry in future
Suppression, abstraction
Cold fingers of tomorrow
Stiff emotions
Refusal of the deeper sights
into our souls
Needles tongue
Escape, entrance
Message to the world...lost.
