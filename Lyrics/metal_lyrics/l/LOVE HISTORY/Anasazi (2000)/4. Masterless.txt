The age of purity
the lowest form of an intelligent human community, they said.
Mere satisfaction of the natural needs
and a common help to feel the mutual solidarity.
The beauty of nature walks hand in hand with longing to survive
and to adapt to the purity of soul and mind in an ingenious harmony,
full of humble respect to everything the highest force brings on.
Development of tribal solidarity
in the name of surviving in a cruel climate
and fights with the killing raiders.
The first swallows of the pious social values,
the souls and minds slowly start to trouble
in the haughty manners and lies.
A profit of the chosen ones,
a profit from blood of the innocent souls.
The beginning of a decline!
