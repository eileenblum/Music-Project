Fountain of knowledge springing up from the depths of ages.
The touches of the sun - stimulator of a spiritual power,
the godly paths still softly chained by blindness.
Yellow is the colour of the south, fading away beneath the dark-blue nightsky
and revealing to the enlightened few the first mystery of the incomprehensible circle.
There are the traces of long forgotten steps in an embrace of science and magic
leading to the core of the most thrilling secrecy ever.
Secrecy of a life.
So long ago future has been born, the future we still can not see.
What a chance to survive deep inside the globe!
Is there an answer to where the power of the Spirit has gone?
Why has wisdom hidden among the veils of the interstellar unknown?
