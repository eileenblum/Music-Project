I missed the way you were yesterday
Backed away from this call
Watching your eyes as they widen
Impressed with you, impressed with me
Perish the thoughts of last words
Everything was new
I have proved that I am yours
You're still waiting
I am yours
Staring at you through my hands
I am already yours
Watching as you walked away
You were always a "someday"
Things change and things change
I'm still here again
I've proved that I am yours
And still you're waiting
Bury my eyes into this life
Still pressed for the prize
