Your hands hold more than you know
The way your eyes will talk to me
Every breath you breathe, breathes right on me
What's been done around: Round and round again
My eyes can see you affecting me
But in the unseen
I have hands holding me from the ground
This is my life
Breathe light
Breathe life
My eyes
They're alreay yours
My life
It's already yours
