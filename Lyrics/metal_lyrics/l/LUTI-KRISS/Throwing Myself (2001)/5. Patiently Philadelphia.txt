Hearing ears
Words that persevere
The whole world in an hour
Take me away
I will hold what's in my hands
Your name is forever
Take me away
These voices telling me my destiny
God, hurry this waiting
Turn around and get the door
You'll own the morning star
Take me away
Your living this waiting
Hurry the patients
Take me away
I've been waiting so long
I can't wait
God is waiting
