A thousand men
Might fall down at my right
A thousand more at my left
I won't be touched
Your will, it be done
I won't be touched
Read them their rights
A thousand men
Might fall down at my right and my left
I won't be touched
Read them their eyes
Read them their rights
Terror in the eyes of my enemy
