Scar me with You
With skin gone
I am stuck in the middle of You
There is nowhere else I want to be
Outside You there is no me
So suffocate, and drown me in You
That is where I'll be
Humbled at your feet
Is where I'll be
Suffocate, and drown me in You
That is where I'll be
I covenant with You
I will walk right
