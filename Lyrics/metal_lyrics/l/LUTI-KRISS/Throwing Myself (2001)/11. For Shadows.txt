So let this begin
It has been so long
Take my hand
I am finally oving on
I see a controversy
And the world, looking at me
Eighteen years
I'm done with chairs
It has been so long
I am finally moving on
I see a controversy
And the world, looking at me
I see a stage of fire
I see the people touched
A cross, it stands before
I see your love
Beggar
I see the world is watching
Send the nations
I'm beggar
Take my hand
Take my life
