Rise
Back on my knees
I thought of you
I've never cried so happy
When I breathe out, you breathe me back
The greatest gift I've got is you
When I smile my thoughts are on you
No death, no life, no time
(Will take me away)
When it's quiet
I know you're there
To my God: Glory
Always seeming two theives at my side
But in you I keep my eyes
You're all I want
Rise
Always seeming two theives at my side
But in you I keep my eyes
You're all I want
God be pleased
This world has nothing to offer anymore. Come back soon
This world has nothing to offer, come back soon
Welcome back
