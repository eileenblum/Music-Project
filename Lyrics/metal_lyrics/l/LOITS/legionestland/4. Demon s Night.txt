Black thunder and lightning
Hatred hailing from the skies
The moon has vanished
Eternal darkness the final demise

Hail!

Thunder through stone
Crushing the path
Darkest of demons come forth
URR for ages to follow

Demons night

Eradication of life - the only way
To eradicate christ once and for all

Not a soul to flee the stake
Reaching the false heavenly halls

A fateful night
Jehovah dethroned
And his throne of lies
Laid to ashes in the universal dome
