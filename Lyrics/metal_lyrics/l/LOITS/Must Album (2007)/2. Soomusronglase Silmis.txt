Metallil mÃ¶irgab metall.
Rebib ja rassib raudruun,
kÃ¼lm, kalk kaasaegne Kalev.
Teel tormab teras truu.

Kes rahutult tukub, kes suitsetab,
kes 'paukpadrunisuppi' helbib.
MÃµnigi neist homme langeb,
mÃµni kallima ees hiljem kelgib.

Istun Ã¤rkvel ja kirjutan sulle.
On hÃ¤mar, mul raskus on laugel.
Kas mÃ¤letad, lubasid tookord
truuks jÃ¤Ã¤da mul, kui viibin kaugel?

Rong vÃµpatab, rappudes seiskub;
murdub mu pliiatsil sÃ¼si.
RÃ¶Ã¶pmed lÃµhkunud vaenlaseraisk.
KÃµlavad kÃ¤sklused, sammude mÃ¼din.

Pikali teetammil varitsen rÃ¼ndajaid.
Mis on see tung, mis ajab meid tulle?
Sihin ja lasen, kuid kÃ¼simus kerkib:
on nad siis vaenlased mulle?

See 'tÃ¤itornis' sell seal on kellegi poeg,
samamoodi kui mina.
Instinkt vÃµidab seesmise heitluse '
vÃµÃµrkeelse kisa lÃ¤mmatab tina.

[In the Eyes of the Rider On the Armoured Train (on the schoolboy-warriors of the Freedom War)]

Metal roars on metal.
Moils and toils the iron horse,
the cold, hardened modern Kalev.
Faithful steel rushes on rails.

Some drowse nervously. Some smoke.
Some, bound for flatulence, eat the pea soup.
Many will fall tomorrow.
Some will brag to their sweethearts later.

I'm staying up, writing to you.
It is dark; my eyes are heavy.
Do you remember your promise
to stay true to me when I'm far away?

The train flinches and joltingly stops.
The pencil lead breaks.
The damned enemy has broken the rails.
Orders are heard, and bootbeats.

Flat on the embankment I wait for attackers.
What is this urge that drives us into fire?
Sighting and shooting, I still find myself wondering '
are they really enemies of mine?

The guy over there, in the pointy uniform hat, is someone's son,
very much like me.
Instinct wins the inner combat.
Lead silences foreign screams.
