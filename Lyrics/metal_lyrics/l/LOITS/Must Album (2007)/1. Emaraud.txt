Raudsoonestik hargneb
ja elulÃ¤tteks saab.
Raudruun sÃ¼nnitab kÃ¼la
ja kaotab vahemaad.

Poetrepil istub vanataat.
Ãks tÃ¼druk mÃ¶Ã¶da tÃµttab.
Noor ema rinnalapsega
kusagile ruttab.

Paar poissi asju ajavad
paljajalu ojavees.
Saeraami Ãµuel mehed
palgil, suitsud ees.

Mis toimub kaugel ilmaveerel,
ei huvita Ã¼ks pÃµrm.
Ei aima veel, et rauda mÃ¶Ã¶da
hiilimas on surm.

Elu tuiksoon juuniÃ¶Ã¶l
mÃ¼rgiastlaks sai.
Ent raud ei olnud mÃ¤Ã¤raja,
kes viidi ja kes jÃ¤id.

On kalmul ammu vanataat
ja Ã¼les vÃµetud relsid.
Vaid ojapÃµhjas endiselt
veenire tuhmilt helgib.

[Motheriron]

The matrix of iron veins branches out,
becoming a spring of life.
The iron gelding gives birth to a village
and obliterates distances.

On the steps of a shop, an old man sits.
A girl hurries past.
A young mother carrying a babe in arms
hastens on her way somewhere.

Barefoot in ditchwater,
a couple of boys busy themselves.
In the yard of the sawmill
men sit on a girder, smoking.

What happens in some far fringe of the world,
no-one cares a dime about.
No-one can foresee
death creeping on the rails.

On a June night
the life-vein became a poison sting.
Yet it was not for the iron to say
who was to leave, who could stay.

The old man is long in his grave, now,
and the rails have been removed.
Only a rivulet of water still dully gleams
in the bottom of the ditch.
