Akendes tulesid nÃ¤ed '
elud, mis vÃµÃµrad, on neis.
Seisatad, sirutad kÃ¤e.
Aitab see sind? Oh ei!

Su enese akendest ammu
on vajadus valguse sÃ¶Ã¶nd.
Ei oota su tulekut keegi,
ei kÃ¼si, kus oled sel Ã¶Ã¶l.

Silmad maas, ei mÃ¤rka sa,
Ã¼le kuis lendab must lind.
Ta varju ei jÃ¤ta ja kaob
vist mÃ¤rkamata ka sind.

Kusagil sulguvad laud.
Sinagi uinuta end.
Ise pead laulma end magama.
ÃÃ¶ on su kaksikvend.

[The Night Song]

Lights in the windows you see '
and lives of strangers behind them.
You stop and reach out your hand.
Will that help you? No chance!

From your own windows
long ago the need has eaten the light.
There is no-one to wait for you,
to ask where you are this night.

Eyes down, you won't notice
the flight of the black bird overhead.
Casting no shadow, it disappears,
having probably not heeded you either.

Somewhere, lids close.
You too must force yourself to sleep,
must sing the lullaby to yourself.
The night is your twin brother.
