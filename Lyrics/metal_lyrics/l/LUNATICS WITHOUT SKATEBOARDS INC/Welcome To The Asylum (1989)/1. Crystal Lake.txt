[Inspired By "Friday The 13th"]

Jason Vorhees
Man behind the mask of death
Which covers
His damaged face

Out for blood
This face of death
At Crystal Lake
Camp blood

Out for revenge
Is what he's now
Terror sets in
You will die

Bodies stained with blood
He killed them one by one
He's the man behind the mask
The killer of Crystal Lake
Lake of blood

Drowned in Crystal Lake
But he's not dead
The smell of death
Fills the air

Because it started again
When they dug him up
He will never rest
Till you're all dead

Revenge is sweet
Blood drips from his knife
He'll rip you flesh
Till there's no breath

Bodies stained with blood
He killed them one by one
He's the man behind the mask
The killer of Crystal Lake
Lake of blood

Jason Vorhees
Man behind the mask of death
Which covers
His damaged face

Out for blood
This face of death
At Crystal Lake
Camp blood

Out for revenge
Is what he's now
Terror sets in
You will die

Bodies stained with blood
He killed them one by one
He's the man behind the mask
The killer of Crystal Lake
Lake of blood
