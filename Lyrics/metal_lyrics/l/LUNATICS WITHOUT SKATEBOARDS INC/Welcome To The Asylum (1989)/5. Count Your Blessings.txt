Stealing money from your parents
To get yourself some booze
You've got no dignity, no self-respect
So what have you got to loose
Waking up with a hangover
Every morning is the same
You think they'll never see through you
For you it's all a game

If you can't change your attitude
And live like every human being
Face the consequences
And count your blessings

Menace to society
Nothing but filth
When the fatal day has come
You're proven of your guilt
The chair is what I'm guessing
You'd better count your blessings

Waiting in the bushes for little girls to pass by
Offering candy and other sweets, lure them with a lie
Your raincoat is all dirty, you wear nothing underneath
As long as you are walking free, no girl is save in the street

You're a menace to society
Nothing but filth
When the fatal day has come
You're proven of your guilt
The chair is what I'm guessing
You'd better count your blessings

Driving in a cheap and rusty car, ignoring a traffic light
You didn't see the couple in the dark crossing the road side by side
Crushing them at tremendous speed, no sorrow, onwards you drive
Leaving the couple behind, who are now disabled for life

Menace to society
Nothing but filth
When the fatal day has come
You're proven of your guilt
The chair is what I'm guessing
You'd better count your blessings
