Living in your cell, your sentence is death
The chair awaits, take your last breath
Locked away, for the crime you committed
Accused of murder, now you'll pay for it
Don't say you're innocent, after what you've done
Laughing at death isn't much fun
Blood on your hands is plain evidence
A look in your eyes, as if you're in trance

She said I haven't betrayed you, it's not what it seems to be
You lost your temper, killed without mercy
Too shocked to leave this bloody place
Handcuffed with a... a smile on your face

Say your last wish as time is running out
The man to redeem you from your sins
To console you and listen to your crying
A servant from God, a prayer for the dying
A prayer for the dying
A prayer for the dying

Living in your cell, your sentence is death
The chair awaits, take your last breath
Locked away, for the crime you committed
Accused of murder, now you'll pay for it
Don't say you're innocent, after what you've done
Laughing at death isn't much fun
Blood on your hands is plain evidence
A look in your eyes, as if you're in trance

The words are spoken, time to die
No fear in your eyes as you approach the chair
The handle is pulled, say goodbye
Seeing the preacher to whom you stare

My son, I hope you understand what I'm about to say
Your life is almost ended, so don't be afraid
The lord you're a good man, so have a little faith
Your soul will rest in heaven, where there is love and no hate

Say your last wish as time is running out
The man to redeem you from your sins
To console you and listen to your crying
A servant from God, a prayer for the dying
A prayer for the dying
