[Inspired By "A Nightmare On Elmstreet"]

He's got...
This he's got!

Woke up from a terrible nightmare
Sheets and clothes torn to pieces
Your memories, you know he's back
No one believes the stories you tell

You're left alone with your fucking dreams
Death will come, when you fall asleep
Suddenly the noise of your alarmclock
And the clicking of a razor blade

1428 Elmstreet
Where it all started
1428 Elmstreet
Where the killings begin
1428 Elmstreet
Krueger's revenge
1428 Elmstreet
It's for you to survive

Fred Krueger son of a hundred maniacs
Waiting... Waiting till you fall asleep
Sleep

Your parents they burnt him alive
That moment he started his curse
He wears a hat to cover his face
On his right hand the razorknives

1428 Elmstreet
Where it all started
1428 Elmstreet
Where the killings begin
1428 Elmstreet
Krueger's revenge
1428 Elmstreet
It's for you to survive

1428 Elmstreet
Where it all started
1428 Elmstreet
Where the killings begin
1428 Elmstreet
Krueger's revenge
1428 Elmstreet
It's for you to survive
