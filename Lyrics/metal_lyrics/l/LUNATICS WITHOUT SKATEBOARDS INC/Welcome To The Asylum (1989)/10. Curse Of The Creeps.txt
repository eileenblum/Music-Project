[Inspired By "The Thing"]

The corpse has been freeze-dried
For many years in a state of suspended animation
Alien creatures fell down to earth
Slimy things with malicious intentions
They invade a body through the mouth
Laying eggs in the brain
You walk dead when they hatch
Your body going down the drain

They are inside your head
You are walking dead
They multiply
Inside your brain
Your face will burst
When you are cursed
Under the curse of the creeps

Heads explode as the slugs spill out
Leaping to other victims
Humans die but the creeps increase
Crushing decapitated corpses
Cops look for an explanation
Is it the works of a psychopath?
Then they realise it's from outer-space
Causing this horrible death

They are inside your head
You are walking dead
They multiply
Inside your brain
Your face will burst
When you are cursed
Under the curse of the creeps

Shoot the head off with a gun
Burn the creeps with a flame-thrower
The slimy things can't stand the heat
Fire will kill them
All cursed ones must be demolished
Not a single person can be spared
Melt the creeps to the last one's gone
Or the curse will start again

They are inside your head
You are walking dead
They multiply
Inside your brain
Your face will burst
When you are cursed
Under the curse of the creeps
