Day by day working hard, losing control
Overwork yourself to reach your goal
The walls that surround you, closing up on you
Your head begins to swim, you are through

Screaming children, hysterical wife, a restless mind
Nothing but sorrow at home you will find
Look in a mirror and what do you see?
The image of a man who lost reality

Mental weakness

The agony within yourself, it's too late
You're locked inside a dreamworld you can't escape
Haunted by visions, sleepless nights
Trembling body, weakening soul

Four men in white coats, your life is done
Put away in an institution for demented ones
Walls surround you but you don't see:
No hope to recover from your lunacy

The agony within yourself, it's too late
You're locked inside a dreamworld you can't escape
Haunted by visions, sleepless nights
Trembling body, weakening soul

Four men in white coats, your life is done
Put away in an institution for demented ones
Walls surround you but you don't see:
No hope to recover from your lunacy

Day by day working hard, losing control
Overwork yourself to reach your goal
The walls that surround you, closing up on you
Your head begins to swim, you are through

Screaming children, hysterical wife, a restless mind
Nothing but sorrow at home you will find
Look in a mirror and what do you see?
The image of a man who lost reality

Mental weakness
