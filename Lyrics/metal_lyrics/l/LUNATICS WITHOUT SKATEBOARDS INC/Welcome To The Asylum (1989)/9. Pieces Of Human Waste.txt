Living in the eighties
Nothing but a rotten future
Drinking all day long
To forget what's happening

Pieces of human waste
Pieces of human waste
Pieces of human waste
Pieces of human waste

You hair has grown too long
You can't get a normal job
Stealing is your way of living
Only way to get some money
People hate your attitude
Despise your fucking way of life
In their eyes you are not human
You're not worth to be alive

Using drugs to forget your problems
Listening to music to get rid of hate
Screw some chicks to get your kicks
I bet you're stuck with AIDS
Cops chase you everywhere
To lock you in their fucking cell
Now you sit between four walls
Waiting what the judge will tell

Pieces of human waste
Born to die in the gutter
Drinking and fooling around
Till they put you in the ground

You hair has grown too long
You can't get a normal job
Stealing is your way of living
Only way to get some money
People hate your attitude
Despise your fucking way of life
In their eyes you are not human
You're not worth to be alive

Pieces of human waste
Born to die in the gutter
Drinking and fooling around
Till they put you in the ground
Till they put you in the ground

Pieces of human waste
Pieces of human waste
Pieces of human waste
Pieces of human waste
