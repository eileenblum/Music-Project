My eyes are getting misty
My mind is going mad
And inside my body
I am feeling so fuckin' bad

Any one who does wrong to me
I will beat him up till death is there
You better don't pay attention
Just let me go anywhere

Sometimes I have these feelings
I don't know where they're coming from
They just take over my mind and body
And I take what ever comes

I wish I could do something about it
But there is nothing I should know
I wish I had a medicine
Before it will explode

Please save me from this hell I'm living in
Please get me out of here, oh please oh
Take me where feelings are much better
Just take me anywhere

If I never will be free from this
There will be a day that it goes wrong
Than my mind is boiled up enough
To do someone something very wrong

I wish I could do something about it
But there is nothing I should know
I wish I had a medicine
Before it will explode

Please save me from this hell I'm living in
Please get me out of here, oh please oh
Take me where feelings are much better
Just take me anywhere
