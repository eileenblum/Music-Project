Feelings nobody can explain
Mostly they think you're fuckin' insane
Never asking the story behind
Seeking for help, hope you'll find

Pain is closing inside your head
Want to taste blood, your all in sweat
Hate is glowing in your eyes
Everything you say is one fucking life

Aggression [x2]

Aggression is there a way to stop

Entering a bar you want to fight
It's the only way that you feel right
You are destruction, you are pain
You are the one that's fucking insane

Aggression is boiling up in you
until one final day, it's all through
No one seems to care a bit
They found a weapon to fight you with

Aggression
