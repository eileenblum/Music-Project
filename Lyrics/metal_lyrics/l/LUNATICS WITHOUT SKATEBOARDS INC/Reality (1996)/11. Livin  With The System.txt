On the edge I'm standing, facing reality
Is this the world I wanna live in
No way, a lot of things must change

Europe has become one, that's a big change
So look at yourself and your own attitude
Every man is equal, black or white
Don't you think it's time to clear your mind

Open your eyes and face reality
Do you wanna live in a world full of hate
Fascism and racism comin' up everywhere
Screaming about a new third Reich

Now you feel it's like standing on the edge
Two choices to make, jump or steppin' back
Jump and everything becomes a big grey mass
Step back and try to be yourself

Don't let others fuck around with your mind
It's so easy to let others think for you
So clear your mind and start again
Choose your own way, don't look back
So free your mind and you'll will see
Together we have to make life worth a living
