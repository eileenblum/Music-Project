They live in a country of war and hate
No food to eat, they're so afraid
There country is ruled by dictature
Scared to loose there power, that's for sure

No sign of happiness, no sign of peace
No sign of any joy
War is ruling their life's you see
They are like living toys

Starving people are everywhere, begging for food and help
Dead bodies lying on the ground, children are alone
What madness are they living in, it all seems like hell
Is there no way to help them out, can't there anything be done

But what am I bothering about, there is no problem for me
When I don't want to see this mess, I just switch off the T.V.
I take a beer and a good book, read it and get drunk
Passing a mirror don't like my looks, oh there is a pimple on my nose, that's fuck

I can't do that man, I can't do that, it's not only their problem
I can't leave them there like shit, I want to help them out
I can't stick my head in the ground any longer until someone chops it off

With power we can help, make ourselves strong
Show them our believes, that what happens there is wrong
Let's try to make a better world, a better place for them
With peace in our minds, show them that when
You help each other out, don't fuck each other up
You can live in peace, no fear will come up
Listen to another, don't shoot right away
Because when you do that, you really are insane

No sign of happiness, no sign of peace
No sign of any joy
War is ruling their life's you see
They are like living toys
