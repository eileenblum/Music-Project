An empty space in front, an empty space behind
Nothing more to see, nothing more to find
This is how it starts, this is how it goes
Nowhere anything, take me where the wind blows

People are just thinking of money and there stuff
We can't live without it, we never have enough
When we have what we want, we want more and more
We offer so many things, we even can't afford

Watch where we are, see what's left of this world
Where is it gone, who is to blame
Money is the reason, money make it worse
How can we quit, how can we stop this curse

Because of our greed the world is like a sinking ship
Every day it's getting worse and we're loosing the grip
We say we have to save it, but people are to proud
We have to save the earth, let's all just work it out

But It is not what I want to
Not the way I wanna go through
Let's do something about it
For all the ones, who are worth it

[Solo]

But It is not what I want to
Not the way I wanna go through
Let's do something about it
For all who wants, who's worth it

People are just thinking of money and there stuff
We can't live without it, we never have enough
When we have what we want, we want more and more
We offer so many things, we even can't afford

Take me somewhere where things still live and grow
Take me where the wind blows, where trees are still green
Where animals still exist, where are flowers to be seen
