I thought it was some kind of religion,
but these days people do everything in the name of GOD
Thou, thou shalt have no other gods before me
Thou, thou shalt not take the name of the lord of thy god in vain
Thou, thou shalt remember the sabbath day
Thou, thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother
Thou, thou shalt not kill

In the name of god, written for ages
In the name of god, abused for years

Thou, thou shalt not commit adultery
Thou, thou shalt not steal
Thou, thou shalt not bear false testimony/witness
Thou, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's possessions
Thou, thou shalt not desire adultery

In the name of god, written for ages
In the name of god, abused for years

Could it be that so many people never learned to read
Could it be that so many people are killing for religion
If lovin' god an' going to heaven means that I have to kill
Let me be a sinner or let me be a heathen

One who only believes in himself
Because than I'll be less dangerous than a serpent of god
If heaven exists only out of murderers
Than let me burn in hell
The practice of the holy book looks like the theory of hell

In the name of god, written for ages
In the name of god, fuck it all
