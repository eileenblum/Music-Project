Live in hell for many years
Overcome the terrible fear
Feeling stronger than ever before
Don't want to hang around anymore

Every body wants to be your friend
Asking yourself when it will all end
Those 7 years are almost gone
And then there is no time to run

You can win this game of evil
everything will stay the same
But when you lose
No one will remember your name

Maybe it's not really worth to try
Because it's almost time to die
Instead of believing that
You placed a daring bet

You signed the contract with your own hand
This time the guitar your only friend
Want to make it, your all in sweat
You must win, it's all inside your head

Blood is spreading around your feet
The devil is not easy to defeat
Asking yourself "why the hell did I try"
A man who is dead cannot die
