Why a word of self destruction
people wiping each other out
with wars, fear and hate
you're fighting for a better world
what's better with all this pollution
or is this the world's new attitude
I don't think this is the meaning of life
I believe a lot but I'm no fool

Are we loosing our way
in this world of misery
is this reality or not
just call it suicide

CFK's effect the ozon layer
cases of cancer increase
industries emitting too much gas (Co2)
while they still cut down trees
acid rain is caused by cars
who are still not rendered harmless
and the way we bring forth energy
(and the shit from a mob of farmers)
