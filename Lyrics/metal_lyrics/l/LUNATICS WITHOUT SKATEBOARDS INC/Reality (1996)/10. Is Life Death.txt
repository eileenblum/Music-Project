Some time ago, somebody told me, life is no great fuckin' deal
He said: "It's the real 'cause of all this hatred you feel".

Feelings of lethargy
Feelings of impotence, bottled up inside
Feelings of liselessness
Feelings of ineptitude, to live your life right

Blame your parents, blame your school
Shame to them, who lay down the rules
Blame the church, blame society
Life itself is the reason for all anxiety

[Chorus]
But there's love and there's hope
So you tell me, however I can show you
(that) Hope turns to fear, (that) Love causes pain
(that) Live is death, Sanity insane

You see, if you want a reason for dying,
I can give you then
If you still think life's worth living,
just tell me where and when

I do know that as I grow older
It becomes more difficult to hold on
The optimism of youth, this blind faith in life
I all fades away, is life death

[Chorus]
But there's love and there's hope
So you tell me, however I can show you
(that) Hope turns to fear, (that) Love causes pain
(that) Live is death, Sanity insane
