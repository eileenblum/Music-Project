I'm standing here, don't know what to say
it has happened, nothing we could do
This is life, you may pray
but every day brings something new
For everyone this is different,
and there is noway you can change
The way you live your life
because that would feel so strange
So you take it, the way it comes
and fly with the wind
In the direction which it goes
where it takes you my friend

Life is not always how we want it
and there is nothing that you can do
when you're locked up in your own hell
and nobody is able to break through
Sometimes there is only one way
one way to quit it all
You take the change without a shout
you're just gonna risk the fall

For you life was over yet
nothing more to get
We know you wanted to leave
now you are free

We do hope you found your rest
and all agree that it is the best
After all the suffer and all the pain
you suddenly left us during the rain
We'll never forget the time you were
and we'll miss you, that's for sure

We'll never forget the time you were
and we'll miss you, that's for sure
