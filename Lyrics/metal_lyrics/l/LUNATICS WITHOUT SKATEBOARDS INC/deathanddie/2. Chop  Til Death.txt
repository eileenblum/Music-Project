Never had a girlfriend, never met a woman,
His problems were getting bigger, so did his dick,
Every night laying in his bed, chopping till his death,
Got no fantasies anymore, got no money to get him a whore

So again lay in my bed, using my hand, in union we stand
Sheets are full of dirty stains, seed is growing in my brains
So again lay in my bed, using my hand, in union we stand
Hope to recover soon, before I paint the whole house white

Got nothing else to do, use my hand tonight,
Laying on your knees, before the TV,
Chopping (becomes) a addiction,

Got no fantasies anymore, got no money to get him a whore
So again lay in my bed, using my hand, in union we stand
Sheets are full of dirty stains, seed is growing in my brains
So again lay in my bed, using my hand, in union we stand

Sitting on the toilet, reading a porno mag...
Seeing Kelly on the screen, makes me gonna.....
Little girls in the street, dreaming to see me.....
Kutpoll in his bed, chopping till his death

Chop till
Chop till death
Chop till
Chop till death!!!!
