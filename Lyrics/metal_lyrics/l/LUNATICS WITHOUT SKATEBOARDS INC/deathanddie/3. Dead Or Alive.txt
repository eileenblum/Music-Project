No feelings, no heart,
His pleasure is to kill,
No reason for his actions,
He's hunted by the law.
Terrorism is a plague,
There's nothing to be done,
Aiming for the innocent,
Is his only fun.

Time is near for them to confront
There minds are filled with hate
The hunt begins, cause he's wanted
DEAD OR ALIVE

No regret in his eyes,
As the timebomb explodes,
Hear the people cry,
From the cinema blood flows.
Giving a last warning,
The next target might be you,
Seeing his best friends blown away,
Will this be the end for him too!

Time is near for them to confront
There minds are filled with hate
The hunt begins, cause he's wanted
DEAD OR ALIVE
