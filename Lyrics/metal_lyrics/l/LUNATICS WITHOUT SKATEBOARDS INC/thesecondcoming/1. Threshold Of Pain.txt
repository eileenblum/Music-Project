Threshold of Pain
I'm the master of pain
The one that drives you insane
Chosen to be my little toy
Come to my world and enjoy

As I play with you my little game
Your body hooked limbly to the frame
Pinned on a pillar your dripping remains
When I take you beyond the threshold of pain

Slowly I'll take off your beautiful skin
Cut off your tongue and do you in
Suck your tasty blood, drop by drop
There's no fucking way to let it stop

Die you helpless bastard
For I command your breath
Cry you helpless bastard
As I demand your death

Threshold of Pain [4x]

[Solo]

Threshold of Pain [4x]

Abusing your body without end
Until it's more (than) you can stand
When you stop screaming and wondering why
My fun is over, I let you die

Die you helpless bastard
For I command your breath
Cry you helpless bastard
As I demand your death
