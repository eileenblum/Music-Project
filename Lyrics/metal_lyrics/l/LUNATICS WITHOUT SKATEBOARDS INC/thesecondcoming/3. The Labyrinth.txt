I've got a little secret
A place with pleasure and pain
You only have to solve the puzzle
You can share with me this treasure

[Chorus]
Walls are opening the labyrinth
There's plenty time to see
Servey and judge the place
After this you belong to me

What's life worth to you
All kinds of madness come your way
Try to escape and survive
There's no way out, so stay

[Chorus]
Walls are opening the labyrinth
There's plenty time to see
Servey and judge the place
After this you belong to me

To enter you must show your pain
We're only interested in your skin
We travel through time to bring death
Play the game and we let you in
It's not the most pleasant way to die
See you taking your last breath
So this was my story of the labyrinth
