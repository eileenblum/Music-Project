Lines drawn in black and white
Jackals spoil for a firefight
In fear we trust to snuff out the light
Tables turning from left to right

In a scapegoat parade, you stand accused
Against the grain of truth, without a shred of proof
A self-righteous charade, to execute
They need a scapegoat parade, to persecute
It's your neck on the blade, in a scapegoat parade

Unbalanced scales will tip
With just one fatal slip
At your heels the jackals rip
When white knuckles fail to grip

In a scapegoat parade, you stand accused
Against the grain of truth, without a shred of proof
A self-righteous charade, to execute
They need a scapegoat parade, to persecute
It's your neck on the blade, in a scapegoat parade

Scapegoat - eyes in the back of your head
Scapegoat - still only seeing red
Scapegoat - with every step you tread
Scapegoat - you might just wind up dead

Your word in null and void
Reality gone paranoid
The jackals overjoyed
To look on as you are destroyed

In a scapegoat parade, you stand accused
Against the grain of truth, without a shred of proof
A self-righteous charade, to execute
They need a scapegoat parade, to persecute
It's your neck on the blade, in a scapegoat parade
