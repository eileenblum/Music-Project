You virgins will expire with rape beyond the skin
Hear the echoes of a mother
Cradling what could have been
Look into eyes unshaken
Look into the fear
Charcoal covered bodies
You made disappear

Peel the skin
From the skull

Arrows deep is where it starts
Sympathy comes at a glance
Hallucinate a forlorn escape
Leading your skinless rape

Seek no compassion
It's not an illusion
Mirthless reaction
Cryptic conclusions

Reap the fear
Ink with blood
Mark their deaths
One by one

Distorted carvings of breed less men
Misplaced memories are all that's left
Disused bodies marked for death
Keep the young burn the rest

Eyes still unshaken
Peel back the skin
Release my fears
No time to react

Arrows deep is where it starts
Sympathy comes at a glance
Hallucinate a forlorn escape
Leading your skinless rape

Seek no compassion
It's not an illusion
Mirthless reaction
Cryptic conclusions

Reap the fear
Ink with blood
Mark their deaths
One by one
