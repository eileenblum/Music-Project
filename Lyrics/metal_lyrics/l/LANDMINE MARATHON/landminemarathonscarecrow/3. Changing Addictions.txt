Inability to move frees
Me from obligations to act
Tasteless depression changes
Addictions no competition

Our convictions pull us apart we walk alone
A new beginning full of remorse and external regret

Changing our addictions
Changes our convictions

We fall short we are alone
No movement in these hands

Grinding knees into the wood and cutting away
The lives of past condemn us to rot in a cage
More mistrust abused and let by the righteous and proud
New beginnings full of remorse and external regret

We begin the assimilation
Of our own degradation
We must not lose what we protect
We must refuse we must reject

Impefect imaginations
Blood shot dead swollen faces
What's the source of our misery
This flawless conspiracy

We begin the assimilation
Of our own degradation
We must not lose what we protect
We must refuse we must reject
