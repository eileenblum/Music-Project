Stigma
Break our stigma
Become an iconoclast

Seize this virtue that is so faint
We realize our own signifacance
And are consumed with hypnotic fervent

And the lamented minds
Of those who live to hate

Languished wth unclouded fires
My blushing palms swell and rage

This uncharted maze leaves all life behind
We begin to rise with the tide

And the lamented minds
Of those who live to hate
Are drunk with self disgust
Guided by vanity

Inbreed and put to rest
Is the life of all humility

Let there be one less oceans edge
Smeared with forgotten graves
One less mother with a lipless grin
Drowning in her faith
We set the stage

We live to hate
