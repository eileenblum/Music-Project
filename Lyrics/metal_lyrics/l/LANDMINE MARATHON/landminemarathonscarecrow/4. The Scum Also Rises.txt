By tooth and claw, by hook or crook
Pretty covers on dirty books
Through hazy nights and wasted days
No sleep in the gutter, sleep in your grave

The scum also rises
The scum also rises

Heart pounding, short of breath
Bitter taste of dust and death
Don't wanna know, ain't gonna care
Another dream been worn threadbare

The scum also rises
The scum also rises
The scum also rises
The scum also rises

Hated and despised
There's fear in your eyes
When we start to rise
No escape tonight
There's no wrong or right
Set this town alight
This our revenge
Watch you break and bend
This will be your end
Trodden under heel
Caught up in the kill
Now your fate is sealed

Lift up your head, don't turn away
Cause every dog gets just one day

Grasp at straws, shoot out the lights
Day won't come, so burn though the night

The scum also rises
The scum also rises
The scum also rises
The scum also rises
