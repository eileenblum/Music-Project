[originally by Acme]Laugh you strike down my attempt
And say not what I really want to say
Things I say are too easy to take
All I can try is to set you thinking
Unfortunately it's up to you to change
It means to struggle inside
With your mind
I'll ever try I'll ever fight
You strike down my attempts
And I say not what I want to say
Too many emotions are in my way
