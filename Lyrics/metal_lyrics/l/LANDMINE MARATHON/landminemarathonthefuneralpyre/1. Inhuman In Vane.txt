Screeching men
Twisted in ways
Inhuman in vane
We honor no death
No faces to stain us
He lies awake
He has no fate
He dies a slave

Hanging unnamed
Hanging blood stained
No reason no fate
With narrow escape
Left in the dust
A man and slave
A broken neck swinging away

Diminish all of his
Purpose and place
Scornful and regretful
Swinging away

Hanging unnamed
Hanging blood stained
No reason no fate
With narrow escape

Fawning over spawn
Creatures too dark to make-believe
Soaked shaking the hands
Rest on shoulders of fate

Chasms too wide
I know your face
Trenches too deep
I know your name
Body too weak
I know your face
Fingers will bleed
I know your name

Hanging unnamed
Hanging blood stained
No reason no fate
With narrow escape
