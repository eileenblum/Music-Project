Hunted in starvation with extinction slicing at the heel
One long raven braid takes several days to burn
Scalps are covered in boils
Echo the sight of a festering sun
Infested oneself with ivory maggots
Rage takes over dismembered bodies
Begin to pile against the stone
Like rag dolls torn into pieces
Two children are left in the cold night's air
Their lips crack open
Skin of the earth begins to bleed
Trembling as they rot in fear
Stalking them are pretty shadows
Singing a lifeless note with each breath
Scaling with morbidity
Claws grasping at the broken branch
No tracks to cover last moment of sanity
An abscess burrows deep inside of reason
She clasps his hand while eyes roll
Into another shattered film
He roots out his own bones
As a sacrifice stricken adversary
Coiling over harvesting eyes
Upon the laden martyrs with morbidity
Mourning each extremity like a broken branch
Offering a sacrifice is insignificant
In this realm of agony
