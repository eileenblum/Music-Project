The infection spreads
Up my spine
Into the back
Of my dead eyes
Wipe them dry
Regretfully waiting
Regret all the anger
Anticipating
The death of a stranger
Igniting the air
With thunder blasted bodies
Raining recesses
Stain the earth
Bodies raining
Run, running far far away from here
Fall, falling hard upon the earth
Find, let us find th cure
Regretfully waiting
Regret all the anger
Anticipating
The death of a stranger
