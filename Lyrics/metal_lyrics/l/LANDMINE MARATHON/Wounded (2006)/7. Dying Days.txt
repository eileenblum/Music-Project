Strutting with the vain
Hatefully I wait
As we fall
Into our reflection
Branding the all blind
Armed with the breed of hate
This mortal flooding will not wait
Counting the days
Down to the hour
Filling them
With false faith
Branding them all blind
Innocently riding our death
Until the day
Of blackened breath
Mortal flooding
