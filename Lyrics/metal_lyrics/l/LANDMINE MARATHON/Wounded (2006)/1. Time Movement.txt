Erupting in time movement
The sea breaks the foot of the cliff
Only to expose the faded face asking for air
Made only to be murmured
Is the installment of death
The rhythm of the waves
Is the digging of the grave
Dig the grave
So sea sick from death
Readily abandoned by those above
Let the sea curl it's fist
And pound against those below
All our backs have bled
Murdered many times by you
All our eyes turn red
Fate is encrypted and long overdue
Our eyes turn white for you
Our fate is sealed by you
Made only to be murmured
Is the installment of death
The rhythm of the waves
Is the digging of the grave
