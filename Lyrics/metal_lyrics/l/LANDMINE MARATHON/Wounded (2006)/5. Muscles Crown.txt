Final flawless backward glance
Is razor sharp and cuts us down
The foundation of my education
Crumbles to the ground
Weighed down by muscles crown
The dead erect a hand
Wake us from our burning beds
Pull us from the end
Catching your contagious ways
Calling your contagious name
I'm not mad, I do not dream
But today I die and tomorrow I
Unburden my soul
Pull us from the end
If this evolution does ring
Hypnotize me make me sing
Ashes lead me to believe
We weill never be set free
Catching your contagious way
Calling your contagious name
Set free
