Run from the army of stichlings
Sewn by the hands of old
Ghostly melodies flaunt
Themselves
Dust and dawn will collide
Not knowing one from another
Shave us down to the bone
As darkness falls and another
War is won, look to home
Beautiful time eating towers
Lay under sober skies
Shreds of their drawn on skin
Lay under sober skies
Not knowing one from another
Shave us down to the bone
As darkness falls and another
War is won, look to home
Rip the seams
Open
Drain his dreams
Dry
25th
Hour
Lets there be light
