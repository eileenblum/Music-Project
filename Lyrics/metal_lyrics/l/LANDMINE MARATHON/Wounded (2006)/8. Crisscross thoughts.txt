Haunt the heart
Spread the lies
Fake your death
Sacrifice
A passing glance
Shatters the mirror
Even it see the slaughter inside
Thought you were the answer
Thought you save her life
Haunt the heart
Spread the lies
Fake your death
Sacrifice
A passing glance
Shatters the mirror
Even it see the slaughter inside
But you brought blood
That bleed veins dry
Criss cross her thought
Men gnawed
Their tongues in agony
As she spoke the words
Of the poets spell
Plauges of past
Left every hour undone
Leaving a silent path
Of lies and destruction
Hate what doesn't exist
Face the reality
Men gnawed
Their tongues in agony
As she spoke the words
Of the poets spell
Plauges of past
Left every hour undone
Leaving a silent path
Of lies and destruction
Hate what doesn't exist
Face the reality
Haunt the heart
Spread the lies
Fake your death
Sacrifice
A passing glance
Shatters the mirror
Even it see the slaughter inside
