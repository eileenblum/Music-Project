Surgical lines are drawn
After the hair is removed
Tools of torture are de-sanitized
And prepped for blood

Slice open the back to reveal the spine
Chisel the brain stem to stop the movement
It's time to operate

It's too bad you'll be awake through the procedure
But the brain must stay intact until your insides are removed
Ruthless incisions
I can't wait to see your face when I abduct your fucking heart

One by one your teeth are pulled out with a dirty wrench
Dropped in acid and then funneled down your fucking throat

Prepped for disembowelment
Prepped for disembowelment

Strung up by meat hooks and gutted like the pig you are
At this point you might as well just kill yourself

Time has come to dispose of the body
Bag the organs and burn the eyes
Incisions made and brain is pressed against the glass
To analyze the way your mind began to fall apart

I have dug canals deep in your flesh
The smile on my face describes the satisfaction

Now you have been disemboweled
Now you have been disemboweled
Now it's time to fucking die

You were just another piece of skin
Another perfect fucking murder
You were just another piece of skin
Another perfect crime

You were just another piece of skin
Another perfect fucking murder
You were just another piece of skin
Another perfect crime
