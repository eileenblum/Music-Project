Spellbinders of the macabre
Will be foretold from human skin
Relinquish pure evil

The moonlight seeping through black haze
Will set the moment of depravity
Vile oblivion possession
Succumb to violent seduction

As hatred shrouds every decision
Dominions gather to commence the final sacrifice
As she's pulled into the woods
And stripped of all her fucking clothes

Raped by trees
Raped by trees over again
Raped by trees

The Necronomicon should never have been read
The spirits of the dead will rise within ourselves
Obscuring reality
And devouring all that is pure

When oblivion enters the mind

As hatred shrouds every decision
Dominions gather to commence the final sacrifice
As she's pulled into the woods
And stripped of all her fucking clothes

Raped by trees
Raped by trees over again
Raped by trees
