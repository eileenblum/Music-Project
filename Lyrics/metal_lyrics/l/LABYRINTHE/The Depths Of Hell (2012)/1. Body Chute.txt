Goddamn
This fucking plague runs ramped in this hospital
the putrid cadavers - providing fodder for the flies
The misconception that those mortals had for life
they were merely pawns in a disease uprise

There is no apathy looming in the virus
malignant spores attached themselves inside

defecation
defilement
lacerations of the brain

creating an infestation 
domination in the finest sense

You're fucking dead and rotted out 
the affliction has prevailed
You're fucking dead and rotted out 
A waste land infirmy

The human seweage leased among the stretchers
makes it way to the body chute
these clinic walls are condemned with god's creation
this epidemic will rain glory upon the streets
survivalists pile out the wicked bodies
As they dump them down the corridor

Decrepit corpses, Hideous and disfigured
their bodies rain havoc on the pavement
Hideous and disfigured a train of hearses await
