This realm of pain will  pave it's roads with all your flesh
Leaving the dead to drain
All the rest will liquify into a sludge
And breed with virgins as they sleep

Victimizing thoughts of hope beyond your self control
Leaving your eyes to rot, inside your fucking skull

The slime of all this sin has fucking covered me
Turning my hate against the church

Where the fuck is salvation?
This book is full of lies
I would rather raise _ the devil himself  
And call out his fucking name

Rise from the depths of hell
Satan 

I'd rather bathe in sin  
Not live God's golden showers

To rule in Hell until the end 
With an Iron fist
Fucking everything in sight 

I Dove into Hell head first and hit the bottom

Swimming through sludge  from the undead
This is my  punishment
Punishment

Why  could I not  just fucking die
Why could I not  just  fucking die
Because Heaven does not exist
