Disregarding everything you said
If I'd listened then I'd be dead
You chose what was the wrong path, for, your life.

Facing the opposition, I stand strong

Fear,
Faith,
I have no regard for either, where will they get me?
Your beliefs are without foundation, I live free. 

They'll break you down, taking everything you ever loved
Everything you have ever loved.

You gotta break free.
Before it consumes.

I've watched them take everything from me but not again,
I won't just sit back and surpress me 

I'll resist until I'm dead.

I will not settle down for anyone, or anything
I will not settle down for anyone, or anything
I will not settle down for anyone, or anything
I will not settle down for anyone, or anything
