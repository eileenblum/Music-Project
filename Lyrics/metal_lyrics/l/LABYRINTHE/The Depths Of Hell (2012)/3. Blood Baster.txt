The melody of dying screams is always pleasuring
They cry for their god but no one's fucking listening

Look into my eyes for i am your savior
Look into my eyes for i am your savior

Amputated ligaments 
slowly drained of all their life
Scattered violently across the death's floor

Gutless still remains of organs clenched inside my palm
driven to lunacy and morbid desolation
My laughter plays inside my empty basement wall
No one will hear me now

Slaughtering in a fury blood pours down like rain
Slaughtering in a fury blood pours down like rain

Bathe in blood
Bathe in blood

Bathe in blood
Bathe in blood

No one will exit from my survival mode
These walls are covered with blood and broken bones
