I bashed your face in with a shovel
Your vision's crushed in their collapsed eye sockets
Your lifeless body convulses in agony
My hands are trembling with excitement
I'm not content with your misery

Salvation will go unanswered - No one will help you
Your worthless god doesn't hear your cries
Just save your fucking breath
The noose will rip your throat to shreds

wailing your torso - attached from my fender
The pavement enthroned as your judge and jury
decapitation is imminent
decapitation is imminent
Your severed body will twitch to the rhythm of death's song

the blades pierce thru your blackened skin
slicing away at your muscles
The trapezius tendon provides a challenges
Barbed tapes constructs the execution

You're just a bag of bones, tumbling down the highway, until someone has
to ID your teeth
You're just a bag of bones, tumbling down the highway, until someone has
to ID your teeth

I am the pure and I will strike you down

You are all filthy you are disgusting to me
You are all filthy you are disgusting to me
