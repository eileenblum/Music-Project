Skin has always spoken to me.
The way it feels the way it tastes...
how it heals and how it can be torn wide the fuck open. Sure I have some scars I'm not in it for the pain...
I find pleasure in taking skin.
Saving it for when I can't feel something alive.
My methods are exact I've left wounds unsewn.
Skin makes us beautiful that is why I collect the only way I
can get to know someone is if I cut them open and look at their insides.
Just to see what they are made of just to see what lies inside.
I wish they wouldn't scream but its my obsession my addiction.
You would not believe how fast your skin can be pulled from your body....fuck.
its a work of art a motherfucking masterpiece the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.
