I can feel her cold hands over mine

as she lays so pale on the cold floor
the spirits, they seem so close
staring at me
as she dies in my arms

The rain falls so softly on my face
as the river runs in front of me
dead trees watch my agony
as the autumn ends again

My mind is so confuse
and now this pain came so cruel
again i lost control upon myself
as the moon rises in the highest skies

Grey walls suffocates me
as this woe is killing me
in my dreams i find some peace
so i hope someday I'll dream forever
angels watch me cry
as the night comes again
the tears fall so softly
as the autumn ends again
