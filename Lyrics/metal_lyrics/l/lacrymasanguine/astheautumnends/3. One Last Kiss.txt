Pain...

And despair
Within my heart
A black rose
That once was alive

My dying heart

Suffering...
Since you're gone
Your warm skin
Now cold as ice
As i lay dying
With my agony

Memory of us
Entwined

One more night
I'm asleep
Wondering why this
Pain never ends
Come to me
Take me with you
My love

One last kiss
On your cold lips
The tears they fall
In the chalice of death
