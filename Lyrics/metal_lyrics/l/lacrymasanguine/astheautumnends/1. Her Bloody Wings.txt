I can see in her eyes

The misery inside
Her tears fall down
As the world decays

And she can't fly
With her bloody wings
The shine in her eyes
Is fading as my heart dies

Cold as the winter
Her skin is frozen
Her eyes are dead and gone
As the sun hides itself
The tears, they fall so red
In this ocean of pain and despair
Entwined with her I lay
Her fragile body over mine

As I cry
I can fell her heart dies
As I cry
I can see her eyes shine
As I cry
I can feel her soul rises
As I cry
She can touch the sky

Her crimson tears
Are falling as I die with her
And as the blood pulses in my veins
I can fell she dies
