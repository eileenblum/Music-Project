Confusion and sorrow
A melting pot full of fear
Living in the shadows of destruction
Why don't you people hear

Internal conflict
Waging war inside my head
Horrific visions
This what the prophet said

Judgement has been written
Fire has been foretold
In the distance Sodom burning
Reaped what they have sown

Sinking ships sail across the seas of sorrow
Tribulation will it be tomorrow
Second coming: eyes of fire burning
To claim the world as king of kings
