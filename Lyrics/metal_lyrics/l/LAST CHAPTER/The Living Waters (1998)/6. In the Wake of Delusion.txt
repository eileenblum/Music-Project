Once I, awash in a stream
Waiting for wisdom to come
Time there, was none to be found
We stood in the wake of delusion

Cleansed with the news I travelled for
Seeking the voice that was calling
In silence, the sounding trumpets ring
Whisper the truth of eternal

Out on the streets, no one dares to stand beside
Believers of what was said to come
And in their suffering within their false beliefs
They'll carry their brudens down with then

Shadows of grief, you must now cast aside
Strengthens the walls of your existence
And in their suffering within their false belief
They'll carry their burdens up to him

Fires presence - surrounds us all
In sullen triumpg - surrounds us all
Now I've seen the mountains fall
Hear, the bitter endings call
