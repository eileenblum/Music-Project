Saddened have I become
The children will suffer
Unknowingly dragged under
Into a clever guise
The darkness has overtaken

A crack in dimension
Slipping through

Approaching within the years
accepting and denying
Truly the worthless foe
Our eyes long ago...blinded

No, this cannot be
O' we are not ready
A warning never heard
A warning...
