Benumb the masses
Detached from the world within
Degeneration
The serpent's shedding skin -
Slaughterous ways

A reptile - devoid of soul
I am the serpents eyes
Suicidal species
We deserve the die

Slaughterous ways in splendour coiled
Buried deep in blood drenched soil

Mankind's desperation
Designs to slaughterous ways
The world of lies they showed me
Collapsing in my face.
