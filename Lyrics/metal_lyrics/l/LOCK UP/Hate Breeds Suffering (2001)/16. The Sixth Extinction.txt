Darkness is a knife
Grey skies hide
A refuge in sickness
Stealth, contempt
Pre-emptive rapture dawns
Post human cult is born

The sixth extinction
When the war is lost do you cash in
your will to survive - the sixth extinction

Sentient machines
Mankind's offspring
Mortal fantasies - techno witchery
Testament to creation
Snuffed out in a single breath

Genetic reverse evolution
Immortality spawned in circuitry
Genetic reverse evolution
The prototype of things to come

The sixth extinction
The sixth extinction.
