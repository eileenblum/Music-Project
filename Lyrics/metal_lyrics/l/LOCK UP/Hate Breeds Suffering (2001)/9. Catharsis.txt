In flesh so weak
Damnation - takes human form
Through mans perversions - unfold

Redemption - forged in flames
Deviant souls laid waste

Eradication - of all free thought
desperation - finish us off

Catharsis- catharsis

Abide the ordeal - devoid of hope
Manifestation - dead end approach

Cursed waste - cold - hate - neglect
Serpents - martyrs - demons

Humanity torn, raped by the spawn of neglect
