Sulfur ritual, seeking shelter, bitter rhymes
Fathomless the hidden psalm sedates the mind
Daggers of stigmata lines of truth arise
Bestial hoops and stillborn wall are magnified

Cascade leviathan
Dragging time - dismembered youth
Cascade leviathan
Primed the sorry dreggs are drained

Orchestras of havoc humming violent themes
Nests in mirrors, satellites - corroding dreams
Sects of shivers - premature the scorpion sting
Senses shot beneath an abscess rhapsody

Desperation garners no gaunt reward
Abyss in waiting - contagion spreading
Tattered nemesis - torrential mood
deviant seeds - substitute for food.
