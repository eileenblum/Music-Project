Holding back - unconnected
Lapsing in a hole
Intermission - never ending
Castigate this void

Cage this retrogression
The gates of change
Disturbing self confessions
Powerless rage

Plummeting hate trivia
Pumping through my veins
Dispassionate envy
Sharpens the blade

Cage this retrogression
The gates of change
Declining optimism
Desire deranged.
