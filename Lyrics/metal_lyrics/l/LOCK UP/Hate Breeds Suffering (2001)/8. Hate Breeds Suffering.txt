Torn down factories
Backdrop for forgotten times
The changing seasons
Progression in a wake of stones

Tear the thorn from our side
Pull the nails from the wrists of decay
Crown the poorman on the street
Hate breeds suffering

The raging cold
memories of the past collide
the vision stands
The touch of flesh and bone

Stare in to the face of unrest
Blind within - hate breeds suffering
Stare into the pain of promise
Blind within - hate breeds suffering

This existence - is a conflict - within
our lives
Sad reflections - grasp the concept
Before we die

Hate breeds suffering
Hate breeds suffering.
