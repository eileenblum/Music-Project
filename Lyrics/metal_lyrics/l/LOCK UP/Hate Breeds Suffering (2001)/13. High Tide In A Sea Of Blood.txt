Lies reflecting lies
Hybrid truths collapse
Fallacies and fiction
The germs of treachery
Evolving far to fast
The pieces that are lost
Return to haunt our past
And launch our nightmares

High tide in a sea of blood
We drown in high - tech bliss
High tide in a sea of blood
High tide......High tide !

Authors of disease
They run before they walk
Identity as one
Soulless jesters
An incest innovation
Deceiving populations
Our character dissolves
To forcify the strong

High tide in a sea of blood
We drown in high - tech bliss
High tide in a sea of blood
High tide......High tide !

Faithless are we godless
Do we posses any inner strength
Regress or progress
Is our instinct our pestilence ?
