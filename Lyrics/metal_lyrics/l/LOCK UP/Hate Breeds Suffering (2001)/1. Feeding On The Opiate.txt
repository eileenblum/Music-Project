Embracing self destruction
Going nowhere fast
Wastelands in the shadowzone
Broods of fear attack

The fuel that feeds my pain
Will make me hate again

Timebomb of frustration
Constant stranglehold
Circle downwards fast towards
A chaos that's perverse

The fuel that feeds my pain
Will make me hate again

Another try another lie
All these hollow shells
Another face, another fake
What's beyond this hell ?

Seasons of the infinite
Feeding on the opiate.
