Narrowminded selfish fuck
I wont take another lie
Coldhearted fucking creep
Vicious circles are your life

Stabbed - in the back
Stabbed - in the back
Knuckles white bent on revenge

Fake somebody - real nobody
Fake somebody - real nobody

Behind your eye's a burning wish
For a life beyond all grief
Betraying everything and all
Clutching dreams in nightmares realm

Again and again
When answers are questions
Only lies remain.
