In unseen reams of genesis
The seeds of revelation
Sculptured carnage
Clears the path to global domination

One step closer - to being alive
We open our eyes - to a broken world

We are all God's madmen that's for sure
Salesmen of salvation
Living engines of destruction
feed us to it's core

One step closer - to being alive
We open our eyes - to a broken world
