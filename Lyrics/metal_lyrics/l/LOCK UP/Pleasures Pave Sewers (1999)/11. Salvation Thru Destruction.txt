Outside looking in
The choices made
Neglecting sense
For so called happiness
Insane delusion
A web of tears
Destroying friendships
Forged from years
There's no salvation
No salvation thru' destruction
There's no salvation
No salvation
Compulsive lies
The questions asked
Pointless answers
The motives masked
Feel of betrayal
Respect and trust lost
Deceitful traitor
Was it worth the cost
