Seeds of aggression
Enemies that we cannot conquer
Demon possessions
Science feeds our eagerness
Greed for attention
In life the knife now is the saviour
We disregard conception

Fever landscapes shape our heartaches
Media interest feeds the interest
Fever landscapes grow the sadness
Designs that twist our fertile minds
Wrath of addiction
Witness to their own mutation
Extracting the weakness
Journey's through the darkened path
