A race for time
Or so it seems to be
Stress outweighs
What pain I even feel
Can't decide If life is worth a shit
Shelter me
Before the vultures sing
This frightening vision is breaking me slowly
Belief is fading shaping my failure
People stealing promising nothing
Time not healing raping my future
The dreams are sacrificed
The dreams are sacrificed
Pushed aside
My heart is torn to threads
Faith subsides
My body feels like lead
On and on
Deceiving circles spark
Toss the coin
Or feed me to the sharks
This frightening vision is breaking me slowly
Belief is fading shaping my failure
People stealing promising nothing
Time is not healing raping my future
The dreams are sacrificed
The dreams are sacrificed
Lost all forms of respect
Just another lamb to the slaughter
Just a code to be misplaced
