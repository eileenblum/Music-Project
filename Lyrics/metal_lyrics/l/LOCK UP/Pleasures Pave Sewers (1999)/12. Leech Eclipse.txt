Death in the air, on the land, in the sea
Stockpiles of waste carving the holes in the sky
Conspiring a myth that for now all is well
Meanwhile all set for a sleigh ride to hell
Leech eclipse
Earth's bloodstained kiss
Eclipse
Millions of self-righteous wimps point the blame
It's our generation that ought to feel shame
Neglecting the fact that the damage is done
We've been here before and will be again
Leech eclipse
Earth's bloodstained kiss
Eclipse
