Fused with this
Systematically existing
To resist
Like pawns on a chess board
Power sadists
Engineering loss of hope
Fortune seekers
Treading you beneath their feet
Submission is your god
A karmic debt repaid in blood
Hate in excess
Feeds their will to make you weak
Empty shells cast into the fire
Submission is your god
It makes you feel safe in the notion
That you're nothing
Just to be used
Raped of being
The sterile tools that carved you blunt
Persecution
Just a frame of mind?
[repeat chorus]
