This whole world's a homicide victim
No one cares for no one
Another spoke on the wheel of suffering
Punished for nothing
We lie, cheat and steal, for what?
For a knife in the back of trust
Crushed beneath the hands of slaughter
To a future without any hope
There are no saviours
There are no favours
Afterlife is purgatory
Chained by our own hypocrisy
Submerged in hate and fear
As we dawn upon a new age
Expression is rage
Child's cry beckoning
Day of reckoning
No use excusing
The answers are not there
No use pretending
That it gets any better than this
