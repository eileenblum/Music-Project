I reject your stance
And all your points of view
Come out from where you hide
And be who you want to
This double standard tease
Which set of friends to please
What morals to defend
Who not to offend
Pretenders to the throne
False Messiahs
Pretenders to the throne
Leave your safety

Who's to judge what rules
Somebody's sense of worth
The conflict in your eyes
Those blatant alibis I believe what I want to
My mind's my own
No compromise
No white lies
