Sick of being used
Trapped inside this shell
Years escaping time
Fear reshaping lives
These ego pawns who call the shots
Torture architects of fate
Are we born to soil the rot
Ego Pawn
Memories fuel the fire
Have I got the strength
Resistance breeds acceptance
Impatience feeds reluctance
Show me the sign
Ego Pawn
