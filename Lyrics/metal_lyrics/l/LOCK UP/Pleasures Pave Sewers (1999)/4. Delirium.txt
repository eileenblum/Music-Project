Stuck in a stalemate
The struggle to breathe and live
We increase the dosage
To cope with the pressure
Free me from the pain
Never again
That's what we say
Delirium
Nauseous convulsions
Deflecting our fears
We stare at the answers
But swallow the questions
Take me away
Cannot resist
Day after day
Delirium
Life is hell
Bitterness is all I taste
Drug hazed memories
Of how I think I was
