Indelicate the stimulus
Screened revelation virus
Like a plague within our conscience
Humanity is not a process
Force fed our hallucination
To propagate in mass frustration
Swallow your choice of vice
Pretend that this is right
Our angels kiss the triple six
Free thought, free will what's wrong in this
Our angels kiss the triple six
Speak from your heart and you'll persist (Exist)
Not trying to judge one another
Without knowing inside each other
The real perversions not in sex
It's in censorship and theft
Sick and tired of programmed feelings
Towards subjects that have meaning
Aged old in prejudice
Just seems to me like madness
Can't seem to shake the world outside
Just seem to hide from the absurd
Sick and tired of programmed feelings
Towards subjects that have meaning
Aged old in prejudice
Just seems to me like madness
Can't seem to shake the world outside
Just seem to hide from the absurd
