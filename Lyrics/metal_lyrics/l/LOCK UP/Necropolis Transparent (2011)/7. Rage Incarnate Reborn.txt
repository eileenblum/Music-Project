The fathomless signs
Displaying the virtue reborn
Breathing down your neck
In a thunderous roar

Emperors and priests denounce
The choirs of the righteous roar
Emperors and priests denounced
Fathered in the ruins of hell

The cancerous cells removed
Fictitious lives enrolled
The assembly line restored
Rage incarnate reborn

Emperors and priests denounce
The choirs of the righteous roar
Emperors and priests denounced
Fathered in the ruins of hell

Broken, silent, speechless
In prophetic sadness obscured
Through the crystal vaults of the heavens
A demigod in approaching
The swarming of locust
In the abyss unleashed

Broken, silent, speechless
In prophetic sadness obscured
The swarming of locust
In the abyss unleashed

No apostles, no prophets
Hell has no fears for us
No apostles, no prophets
We repent for no heaven
