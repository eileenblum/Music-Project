[Bonus Track]Greed is a knife, the scars run deep
Deep are wounds that bury the shame
Chained to betrayal it builds a cage
A cage of deceit filled with pain

Nailed to creations demise
Bleed into the pit of lies
As with life and now in death
Bare this crucifix of flesh

Accepting fate, denying truth
Condemned by filth it reflects in you eyes
The concept of love twisted and torn
Destroy all who care, death is release

Nailed to creations demise
Bleed into the pit of lies
As with life and now in death
Bare this crucifix of flesh

Nailed to creations demise
Bleed into the pit of lies
As with life and now in death
Bare this crucifix of flesh

Greed is a knife, the scars run deep
Deep are wounds that bury the shame
Chained to betrayal it builds a cage
A cage of deceit filled with pain
