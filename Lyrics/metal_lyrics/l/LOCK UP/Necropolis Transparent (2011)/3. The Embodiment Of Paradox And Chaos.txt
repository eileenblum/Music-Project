Wired on anger, frustration and pain
The Chameleon strikes at their hearts
Natures murderer veiled in cowardice
Carving paths of despair

Where is this great Architect of the Universe?
Where is this god?
Who feeds from the wounds of chaos?

Distant and dispassionate
Perverted vulture surging on frailty
Instant and catastrophic
This breeder of anarchy demands faith

Where is this great Architect of the Universe?
Where is this god?
Who feeds from the wounds of chaos?

Within the womb of Armageddon
All who follow the doomed
Within the womb of Armageddon
The only belief is Pain... Pain is belief in pain!
Pain is belief in pain!

The embodiment of paradox and chaos
Wired on anger, frustration and pain
The Chameleon strikes at their hearts
Natures murderer veiled in cowardice
Carving paths of despair
Distant and dispassionate
Perverted vulture surging on frailty
Instant and catastrophic
Where is this god?
Who feeds from the wounds of chaos?
