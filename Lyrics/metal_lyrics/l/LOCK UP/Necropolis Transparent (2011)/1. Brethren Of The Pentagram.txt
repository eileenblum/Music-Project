Unified infernal minds
Darkness guides the spirit
Towards the illumination of fate

Sinister shapes aligned by the star
The constellation unwinds

The gorgon eyes engraved in crystal
Raping the brains of the weak
The inner sanctum of depravity
Only the strong endure

A phoenix born in awe
We taste the serpent once more

Smothering the cowering - engulfing insanity!

Congregation of the cranial damned
Brethren of the pentagram

Unified infernal minds
Darkness guides the spirit
Towards the illumination of fate

Congregation of the cranial damned
Brethren of the pentagram
