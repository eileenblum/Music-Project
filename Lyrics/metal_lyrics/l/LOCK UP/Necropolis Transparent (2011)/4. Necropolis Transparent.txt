Necropolis transparent
No miracle, no salvation
Necropolis transparent
No miracle, no resurrection

The canyons blackened
And void of sound
The future nothing
But salt in the wound

Necropolis transparent
No miracle, no salvation
Necropolis transparent
No miracle, no resurrection

The children accursed
Consumed by guilt
The signal lost
Under the desolate sea

A sacrifice for culture
Plague still raging - stabbing your eyes
Weapons for our degeneration - stabbing your eyes

Necropolis transparent

A sacrifice for culture
Plague still raging - stabbing your eyes
Weapons for our degeneration - stabbing your eyes

Necropolis transparent
