The horrendous white abyss of shrieking delirium
A dirge sung for existence
The symphony of the conquering worm

The serpent or wisdom
Orchestrated from below

Barbed with pain, the revelation
The festering plague, world without end
Crowned in nothing, I am the wound
The heir to the ages of wonder
Vomiting evil

Disillusion, arcane and profane
The raging chaos
The testament of man
The creatures' eyes - heavy with sin
Unlock the gate, once again

Barbed with pain, the revelation
The festering plague, world without end
Crowned in nothing, I am the wound
The heir to the ages of wonder

Endless funerals
A reign of razor-sharp routine
Cemetery diversions
Our lives dissolve into the void
Vomiting evil

React with the disease
This abattoir - a maze that dreams
React with the disease
