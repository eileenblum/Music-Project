Molding the extremity, contorting its depravity
Life can be a deformity, a solitude of pain, of pain

The clawing hands of perversity writhe
They twist, they tear our fears, our strife

Infiltrate - infiltrate and destroy
Infiltrate - infiltrate and destroy

Progressions of failure they intensify
Inhaling the stench of compromise

Regrets in life that we all harness
The bitterness that threatens our willpower

That threatens our willpower
That threatens our willpower

Let society be the grindstone
On which you sharpen your hatred

Regrets in life that we all harness
The bitterness that threatens our willpower

Inhaling the stench of compromise

Infiltrate - infiltrate and destroy
Infiltrate - infiltrate and destroy

Regrets in life that we all harness
The bitterness that threatens our willpower

That threatens our willpower
That threatens our willpower

Will society be the grindstone
On which you carve your hatred?

Regrets in life that we all harness
The bitterness that threatens our willpower

Progressions of failure they intensify
The clawing hands of perversity writhe
