Why did it start? How did it all begin?
The seeds of purity scattered
And corruption gnawed within
Lost from your heart, the unbearable pain
You embraced your sadness
Swimming the sewers of mental slavery

Climbing a ladder of desperation
Living a life of devastation
Drowning the hopes and feeding the failure
Trapped - trapped - trapped
In this life of devastation

Gasping for air tainted with fear
A bitter cocktail
Drowning insecure thoughts
Clutching at straws
No more roads to take
Prepare to face the end
No more tears to cry
Crawling in mindless desolation
Content with a life of devastation?
You cannot escape its poisoned reflection
Trapped - trapped - trapped
In this life of devastation
A life of devastation!

Imprisoned... imprisoned within
Self-destructive... self-destructive hymns

Climbing a ladder of desperation
Living a life of devastation
Drowning the hopes and feeding the failure
Trapped - trapped - trapped
In this life of devastation
A life of devastation!

Gasping for air tainted with fear
A bitter cocktail
Drowning insecure thoughts
Clutching at straws
No more roads to take
Prepare to face the end
No more tears to cry
