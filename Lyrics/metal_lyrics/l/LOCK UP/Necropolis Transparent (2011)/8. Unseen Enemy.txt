Life is draining me
Awaking to deception
Masters of frailty
Scrape us of identity
We suppress suspicions
To tolerate their concepts
I fear our lives are tainted with blood

Repel the iron fist of the machine
Unseen enemy we seek you out
Smash the face of oppressive faith
Unseen enemy, I cast you out

This world is cursed
Butchered by the past
The struggle is futile
A constant dogma
Crowned in filth and sloth
The system will collapse
I fear my life is tainted with blood

Fodder for the corporate elite
Human sheep clones reprogrammed

Regress their power

Repel the iron fist of the machine
Unseen, enemy we seek you out
Smash, the face of oppressive faith
Unseen enemy, I cast you out
