Draped in emptiness
The disease has multiplied
Arachnid heretics
Spin webs of holocaust

Entrails in the sky crack open
Bludgeoning acts of intimidation

Snake like illusions blur reality
Within the dÃ©jÃ  vu of fatigue
A sickening sÃ©ance
Tomb of life, sealed in grief

Drapedin emptiness
The disease has multiplied
Arachnid heretics
Spin webs of holocaust

Snake like illusions blur reality
Within the dÃ©jÃ  vu of fatigue
A sickening sÃ©ance
Tomb of life, sealed in grief

Accelerated mutation of the anti-god
Accelerated mutation of the anti-god

Like a black oozing tide of death
This destroyer of reason and logic
Like a black oozing tide of death
Like a black oozing tide of death

Snake like illusions blur reality
Within the dÃ©jÃ  vu of fatigue
A sickening sÃ©ance
Tomb of life, sealed in grief
