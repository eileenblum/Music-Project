Life is slipping away from us all
Endless - the timeless fall
Twisting thru the machinery of fate
Sadness climbs mounting scorn
Wishing we were never born
But we're here non-the-less
Apologies seem an infinite wish
There is strength in weakness

Pride the destroyer assassin of faith
Regret the past but learn for future
Sin the aggressor the tyrant of persecution
Relive the moments, discharge the fear

Belief is crumbling fading black
All the lives we have attacked
Who is there to bring us to our knees?
Selfish loathing empty shells
Judgement day the 13th bell
And our lives are at an end
Apologies seem an infinite wish
There is strength in weakness
Release the rage, accept the truth
Cleanse the poison thru

Pride the destroyer assassin of faith
Regret the past but learn for future
Sin the aggressor the tyrant of persecution
Relive the moments, discharge the fear

Discharge the fear!

Sadness climbs mounting scorn
Wishing we were never born
Who is there to bring us to our knees?
To bring us to our knees?

Cleanse the poison, cleanse the poison pure
Release the rage and accept what's true

Pride the assassin destroyer of faith
Discharge the fear!
Sin the aggressor the tyrant
