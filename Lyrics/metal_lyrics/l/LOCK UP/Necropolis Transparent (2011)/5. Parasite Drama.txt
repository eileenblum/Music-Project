Faceless assassins wearing masks of sympathy
Faking attention vague with apathy
It intensifies my need, my need to defend me
It intensifies my need to escape this parasite drama

Soulless creations shield their plastic hearts
Their eyes, a dark mirror, pools of deceit

It intensifies my need, my need to defend me
It intensifies my need to escape this parasite drama
Persecuted? Persecuted for individuality
Resurrected - the hate for falseness smothering me

The cuts still bleed but they reinforce the will
Ignorance is cast aside

Persecuted? Persecuted for individuality
Resurrected - the hate for falseness smothering me

The cuts still bleed but they reinforce the will
Ignorance is cast aside

I need to escape this parasite drama
Parasite, parasite, parasite drama

Alone it seems in this den of Tragedy

The Liars, the Fevered, the Drugged
The Imprisoned, the Acid Scarred
A Choir - of tragic resignation
