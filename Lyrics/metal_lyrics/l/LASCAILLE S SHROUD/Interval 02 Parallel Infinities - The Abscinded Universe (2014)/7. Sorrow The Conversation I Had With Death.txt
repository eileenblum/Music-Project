[V:]
Am I myself, am I the one I struggle to remember?
I cannot recall these memories - are they of me?
Or just machinations of indoctrination?
Entwined in war with the entities of death
What you were, what you are and what you will be
Conjoined, in the ideals of a perfect system

[S:]
Betrayed I am, by own DNA
Not even granted death
Reconstructed in grotesque horrors
Forced to kill for my Sovereign king

[D:]
Evolution â such irony
You obtained what you have sought, and despised what you found
Turned into such a deformed thought
Repulsed by your own actions

[V:]
Death ignites the sky, ending galaxies
Countless lives have been brought to an
Endless war is perpetuated
Yet still I am caught here with
You are the only thing I'll long for
Just one more century
To undo all that I have done
To this world, to my girls
Yet shall you remain, my enemy?

[D:]
Death â ironic i am
I took everything you could never loose,
And left you with your life, the single thing you despise
Am I the price of Godliness?

[V:]
Death ignites the sky, ending galaxies
Countless lives have been brought to an
Endless war is perpetuated
Yet still I am caught here with
You are the only thing I'll long for
Just one more century
To undo all that I have done
To this world, to my girls
Yet shall you remain, my enemy?
