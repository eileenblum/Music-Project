[V:]
Immense quantities
Unfathomable energy
Churning maelstrom
Mold the portal
Baryonic and dark alike
All matter consumed
Violent whirlpool
Through the bulk

Engage the engines
Start up the systems
Begin the process
Devour existence

[S:]
Out of the dark
Consuming light
We transcend reality

[V:]
Becoming...
More than what we know
More than time
Beyond life
Beyond death

[V&amp;S:]
Immense quantities
Unfathomable energy
Churning maelstrom
Mold the portal
Baryonic and dark alike
All matter consumed
Violent whirlpool
Through the bulk

[V:]
Shattering apart
My death is finally here
Bring me the peace
Of non-existence

[S:]
Euphoric pain in the cold dawn of time
Bringing me peace in glorious unbirth

[V:]
A finite point of light
Bursting into a star

[S:]
An ever-expanding point of light
Stopping time just for us

[V:]
Crossing the barrier between our world and the next
My body overcome by a strange sensation
I cannot explain what it is to feel this
Born again or alive after death?

My eyes, am I blind?
My limbs, am I dead?
No!
Time yet to dawn!

Disengage the engines
Abort the systems
End this process
A new existence

[S:]
Out of the dark
Consuming light
We transcend reality
Becoming...
More than what we know
More than time

[V:]
Beyond life
Beyond death
