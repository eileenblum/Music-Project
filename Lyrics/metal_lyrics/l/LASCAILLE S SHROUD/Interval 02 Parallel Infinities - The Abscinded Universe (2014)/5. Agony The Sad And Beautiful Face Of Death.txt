[V:]
An indescribable weight
Crushing my chest
My heart ceasing to beat
Too shocked to even cry

An anger wells up in me
I've not known in centuries
Compounding sorrow
My body falls apart

Never were we to be the harbingers of death
To be the ones to bring an end
I sought a different world for us all
A different world for just for you

[A:]
Twenty five thousand years under the guise
Of a cold blooded killer with a saviors eye's
The corpses of a billion souls dead at my feet
The voices of a billion screams

Have you ever looked into the eyes
Of a crying child as you take their life?
Promising heaven and giving them hell
Is this the monster you always sought?

Blank are my emotions
I despise myself
I have become nothingness
Nothingness infinite

Everyone else is forced to die
Then why not you suffer their fate
Why not die at the hands
Of the monster you helped create?

[A:]
How many ways, can one die in space?
Can death be a release and not tragedy?
If no one is left to remember the dead
Can we ever hope for life again?
All I see is pain
The death of the stars
The shattering of spirit
All I feel I can never describe

[V:]
What happened to you?
What have you become?

[A:]
Am I not what you asked for?
Am I not your precious masterpiece?

[V:]
Can I not convince you to cease this war?
I already despise me, there is nothing left to hate!
Won't you please listen! I can make this change
I already lost her, I can not lose you too!

[A:]
No more can I listen, what I did cannot be undone
No more can I stand, what you did cannot be undone
No more can I breathe, what I did cannot be undone
No more can I see, I hate everything!

[V:]
Why must this be left to me?
Why have I been handed this fate?
Should I care what happens!
There is nothing left to save!

Why must she be forced to die?
Is she still not more innocent than I?

Drifting ever so gently
Into the darkest madness
Falling ever so slow
Into the emptiness

Won't you help me?
There must be a way
Can't you hear me?
Don't you abandon me now!
I know you can hear me!
I know there is a way!
I know what must be done...

Drifting ever so gently
Into the darkest madness
Falling ever so slow
Into the emptiness

[A:]
Are you afraid of God?

[V:]
No...But I'm afraid of you

I can never forgive myself
For the horror I am about to commit

I lay you down, just as you were as a child
Tears streaming heavy down my face
Dropping down, running off the blade

I will never forgive myself
For the horror I have done
For taking this life

I will bury you all
In oblivion
I will lay waste
To every last one of you!

Twenty five thousand years under the guise
Of a cold blooded killer with a saviors eye's
The corpses of a billion souls dead at her feet
I'll ever hear is her dying screams

Have you ever looked into the eyes
Of your crying child as you take their life?
You promised them heaven, You gave them hell
In waves of immeasurable death

Have you ever looked into the eyes
Of your crying child as you take their life
You promised them heaven, you gave them hell
In waves of immeasurable death

I have looked into the eyes
Of my crying child as I took her life
I promised her heaven, I gave her hell
In waves of immeasurable death
