Now that I can see the end 
Can I do what must be done? 
Can I learn to control 
This monstrosity inside? 

In myself I know I can find 
All the things I despise 
But what am I now 
If I am not God? 

What if we fail, what if we fall? 
What if our reach exceeds our grasp? 
Can we sustain a defeat of this size? 
A war with uncertain odds? 
What I'm weak, and what if I'm wrong? 
Just a shepherd leading the flock astray? 
Can we bear another failure? 

The ugly truth of us 
Cosmic triumvirate 
Combating death with death 
My faith in us is wavering 

Preserving life with blood 
No knowledge or culture left 
History a grand failure 
Evolution was just a joke 

What if we fail, what if we fall? 
What if our reach exceeds our grasp? 
Can we sustain a defeat of this size? 
A war with uncertain odds? 
What I'm weak, and what if I'm wrong? 
Just a shepherd leading the flock astray? 
Can we bear another failure? 

What if we fail, what if we fall? 
What if our reach exceeds our grasp? 
Can we sustain a defeat of this size? 
A war with unknowable odds? 
What I'm weak, and what if I'm wrong? 
Just a shepherd leading my flock astray? 
Can I sustain another failure? 

We do not get the luxuries of death 
Our identities remain nameless 

We will not live to ever see 
The world we fight and die for 

We do not get the luxuries of life 
A sweet embrace, a caress denied 

All that we love and all we know 
Not even remembered by the dust of stars 

Plagued by our vague humanity 
We were always such a brilliant disease 
Plagued by our vague humanity 
Yet even disease can have beauty 

What if we fail, what if we fall? 
What if our reach exceeds our grasp? 
Can we sustain a defeat of this size? 
A war with uncertain odds? 
What I'm weak, and what if I'm wrong? 
Just a shepherd leading the flock astray? 
Can we bear another failure? 

What if we fail, what if we fall? 
What if our reach exceeds our grasp? 
Can we sustain a defeat of this size? 
A war with unknowable odds? 
What I'm weak, and what if I'm wrong? 
Just a shepherd leading my flock astray? 
Can I sustain another failure?
