[V:]
I could not understand the motives of time
I could not see the path lain beneath my feet
I could not feel the world I'm destined to destroy
I could not sense the pain echoing through me

And I would like to know, will I remain the same?
And I would like to know, if I could die some day?

My hands could never touch, the atoms in the air
My tongue could never taste, the exhaust from the stars
My lungs could never breathe, the rivers deep in time
My brain could never grasp, the space between space

And I would like to know, will I remain the same?
And I would like to know, if I could die some day?

Submit to your absolute fear
Surgical, precise evolution
Dive into a realm beyond existence
Will I awake at the end?
Submit to your absolute fear
Surgical, precise evolution
Become the thing you always hated
Assassinate the remaining semblance

Though I never felt the presence of a God
I had aspirations of another life
A realm beyond this trite and futile flesh and bone
Standing on the precipice to transcend

My eyes can now perceive, the movements of time
My heart can now beat, To the rhythms of their pain
My mind can understand, the atrocities I will do
My hands already drenched, with blood yet to be spread

And I would like to know, will I remain the same?
And I would like to know, if I could die some day?
And I would like to know, is eternity forced on me?
And I would like to know, what have I become?
