My powers shrivel as my regrets blossom
By the time I realized how far I had gone
It was too late to stop it
But there is still one last chance at redemption
For both of us...
What I have done, cannot be undone
I cannot stop what I have put in motion
But perhaps, I can keep it from ever starting
He was my first hope, and now he is my last

All of this has to end
Will I be strong enough to see all the doors
And open whichever I choose
And if I bring him here
Who Is to say he would be any match
for the monsters I have created?
But in the end he is the one
Who will have to pay down all of our accounts
won't he?

Where does his guilt start...and mine end?
