[V:]
Contemplating this moment for every second of every year
A surprise assault on the enemy fronts
Caressing and shaping master Antares
Weaponizing my existence

I can see in all directions
Foresee the path of evolution
I can know everything
I am everything

I am a God
And my enemy is God
The devil, the beast, aggregate
Cosmically unbiased
I am a God
And our enemies are Gods
An entity unified in flawlessness

[S:]
Glorious cities that soar across the voids
Armada impenetrable, invulnerable swarm
Crashing through stars â like ships across a sea
Always with time you'll bow to our supremacy

I am all destinations
All paths end at these gates
I am the God of all religions
I am everything

I am The God
And my enemy is false
The saint, the sinner, anomaly
Ambitious hypocrite
I am your God
And you are condemned
Inferior Triumvirate

[V:]
To know that you stand on a precipice
The dawn of a vast and sudden change
And stare deeply into that abyss
Is to let the abyss stare into you

Facing down a sentient black
That lusts to consume me
I reciprocate the eagerness
To unleash my own hell

Clenched hands around the girth of a star
Above the cities of my enemy

Reduced and compressed
Into a Schwarzchild radius
Thermal emissions completely concealed
Gravitational Lensing cloaked and veiled

Vacuum dive process beginning
In preparation for hostile contact

[S:]
I can feel an unnerving presence
Shrouding itself from me, I know it must be them

Enter the hall of grand destruction
So begins the congregation of non-existence

A flash of light above - a dying star?
Light-hours of skyline engulfed in light

[V:]
Bringing down the stars
Upon the gates
Launched forth a black hole
To obliterate the consensus

Riding the rifts in space and time
I gladly invite this war

My ancient memories begin to swell
For those time left behind to die

I cannot believe what I see
Unfiltered perception must lie
A silhouette on a descending star
Transformed by jaws of war

The instinctive pang of disgust and fear
On a separated mind
Gracefully in her horrific state
She moves across the stars
Indefatigable beauty and grace
A flawless seduction

Intense and immeasurable pain burning my chest
Elegant hand clenching my heart
Tightening grasp around my throat
âWhy did you kill meâ she screams at me

If only I could die
I'd gladly let you kill me

[S:]
I am The God
And my enemy is false
The saint, the sinner, anomaly
Ambitious hypocrite
I am your God
And you are condemned
Inferior Triumvirate

[V + S:]
I am a God
And my enemy is God
The devil, the beast, aggregate
Cosmically unbiased
I am a God
And our enemies are Gods
An entity unified in flawlessness
