[V:]
Trembling from paradigm shifts
Unknowable pain
Mind contorting: exploding stars
A panicked heart: erupting seas

Breaking the surface of the water
This liquid enveloping my identity
Desperately inhale for air
A vortex that consumed worlds

Steady my mind and prepare, prepare for the onslaught
As my nervous system attunes itself to this violent universe

Steady my mind and prepare, prepare for the pain
A passionate lamentation - the genocide of culture

All I wish for is my blindness
I can never open my eyes
The intimate truth of existence
Unveil its true features to me

Weeping with closed eyes
This sound alone shatters my soul
Forcing my body into the fetal form
I breakdown with the agony

Steady my mind and prepare, prepare for the onslaught
As my nervous system attunes itself to this violent universe

Steady my mind and prepare, prepare for the pain
A passionate lamentation - the genocide of culture

I scream and I scream
Louder and louder
Forcing my lungs
To cry a crescendo

To block out the noise
To block out the pain
I desperately crave
I desperately need

To know the sweet release of death
To be granted the choice to die
But it's too selfish of me
To ask â in these times â such luxuries

Releasing my hands â the veil of my sight
Blood dripping from where I dug into skin
I peer into everything and nothing all at once
Accept the pain of my approaching sins

There was a singular moment I recall
A vanishing weight from deep within
When something inside me, something inside fell asleep
And something else unknown woke up
