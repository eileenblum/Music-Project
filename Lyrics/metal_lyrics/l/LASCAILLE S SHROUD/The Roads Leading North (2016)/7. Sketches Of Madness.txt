In the shadows, there continue to exist those who would use Elizabeth for their own ambitions.

And they approach.

[The Tormentor]
In my talons, I shape clay, crafting life forms as I please. Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth. My whims will become lightning bolts that devastate the mounds of humanity. Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision.
God: the title suits me well.

[Elizabeth]
Within the swirling void of existence, I was forced to abandon everything. Everything I was, everything I thought I knew. The universe itself became ashes on my skin, and the way it burned was the natural order of things. Even now, words to describe the agony, the loss I came to know elude me. I found familiarity in the emptiness, a companion in the sea of death I was determined to cross.
I lost friends, I lost hope. But I persevered. The world was spread out before me, and caught in neon glares and constant surveillance I fought. No torture or despair could stand before me, no gods or heroes. I was born as nothing, and in death I will be nothing.
But before that I had to do something, change everything. I would have sooner seen the universe collapse than sit idly by, huddled afraid in some alley. I didn't ask for this. I didn't seek out misfortune, but when it found me, I refused to give in. Just as I know you will, when the fires crawl ever-closer, when the stars themselves shoot holes through the reality you've grown comfortable in, you will stand.
Alone if need be.
