Elizabeth and Compass return to the place where they once ran from, seeking to put and end to this once and for all.

They fight their way through a warzone in the Neon City, mercenaries falling left and right, dead.

When she eventually reaches the research facility, she meets the man heading the Diaspora Initiative, a man she has been influence by for far too long.

And kills him.

[Elizabeth]
Facing the pale countenance
Of my neglected past
My nightmares are becoming
Neon lights call out to me

Wandering aimlessly no more
No longer willing to be a victim

[Compass]
Searching endlessly no more
No longer willing to be a witness

[Elizabeth]
Penetrating into the heart of my thralldom
Facing the faceless
Naming the nameless

[Compass]
One by one they fall to her
Soldiers of dystopia
Echoing through the empty streets
Gunfire erupting, a thousand points of light

[Elizabeth]
Eye to eye with the icon of my thralldom
Killing the faceless
Murdering the nameless

[Compass]
The neon city erupts in violence, a storm of gore
An orgy of lights, aconflagration of color and blood
Silent night shattered by the violent assault of gunfire
Bullets rain on the city streets â Utopian wasteland

[Elizabeth]
Emerging from the smoke and haze a glimpse of me the world receives
A blurry image on their screens with unknown visage and intent
And pushing through the fear and pain against the light of death combat
The sudden urge that overwhelms and beckons me into my dreams
And unrelenting, unforgiving is the hatred that I feel
And struggling against the thought of who through this I might become
But there is rage in me that I feel no concern to quell
If I'm to die in doing this then I'll make sure that you have known my hell

Not because that it is right and not because that it is just
And not because that you've deceived and not because the world believed
And not for all the death its wrought and not for all the trauma caused
And not for what you made of me and not for what you've made me do
I am going to end your life for nothing more than but I can
I am going to feel your blood warm and red course down my hands
Everything you've ever built will all come crashing down on you
If I'm to die in doing this then I'll make sure that you have known my hell

[Compass]
The neon city erupts in violence, a storm of gore
An orgy of lights, aconflagration of color and blood
Silent night shattered by the violent assault of gunfire
Bullets rain on the city streets â Utopian wasteland
