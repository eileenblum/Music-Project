The Diaspora Initiative. Elizabeth and Compass finally discover an inkling of their plans. They wish to use the colony of nanomachines for themselves and their own purposes, to give them an unparalleled level of control over both the individual and the masses.

Compass cannot allow this.

She has seen countless people seek to subvert technology in this manner, and none of them have succeeded.

Neither will they.

[Diaspora]
I am an idea, I am not flesh
Born in the mind I fester and thrive
I am knowledge, admonishing faith
Grown in the world I revel and writhe

The throbbing wounds of old injuries
Afflicting the flesh of worlds
A burning sensation we like to numb
All just so that we can forget

The distance between the worlds
The length we've to endure
The time between the stars
The ache we must suffer

Confessor of sins I know that I partook
I cannot stand to be this numb
Torturous in our inaction â Torturous
Agonizing is our indecision

I am not a revolution
I am not upheaval
Power is not my desire
To assure our existence
To assure â I will do anything

We are the distance between the worlds
It is the length we must endure
We are the time between the stars
It is the ache we must suffer
We are the stellar embodied ambition
It is the fate we must capture
We are the starry drive to succeed
What nature says we should not be

Nanoscopic infiltration
DNA embedded subversion
Nanoconstructive seductive coersion
Do not slight the mechanism
Do not question

[Compass]
I have traveled this world
Naive and unaware, painfully ignorant
Of this festering, plague-like idea
You claim to understand

Fated to fail, I've seen this before
I grow tired of this repetitious exchange
Always blinded, organics seem to be
By their own devotion to their own reality

[Elizabeth]
Inside of me â timeless
Pathogens of life
The answer our world has always sought
Dwelling 'neath my flesh and blood

Inside of me â deathless
Machines of life
The answer you have always sought
Dwelling 'neath my flesh and blood

[Compass]
Fundamental misunderstandings
Brazen and arrogant, painfully unaware
Of the festering disease you dare to call
Progress

Against the law and truth of light
What the universe imposed
To expand and proliferate
The insignificant genes of a race

[Elizabeth]
Inside of me â formless
Ideas of life
The answer I never sought
Dwelling 'neath my flesh

[Diaspora]
We are the distance between the worlds
It is the length we must endure
We are the time between the stars
It is the ache we must suffer
We are the stellar embodied ambition
It is the fate we must capture
We are the starry drive to succeed
What nature says we should not be

We are the distance between worlds
We are the time between stars
We are the stellar embodied ambition
We are the starry fire to succeed
