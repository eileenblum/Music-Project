Barely surviving the endeavor with the mech, Compass and Elizabeth emerge from near-death ... changed.

Compass has embedded herself so deep within the core of the Colony in order to keep her alive, there persona's are nearly completely merged. Separated, but hosted in the same body.

Distant and cold my past and future
Here in this moment, transcend
The cusp of tomorrow, an approaching horizon
My burdens heavy, my body weak
I am me but not âIâ â pluralized personality
Segmented and torn â annexed and joined

No destiny
The paths belong to us
No destiny
There is only choice
No destiny
No recognition of fate
This burden is ours
This choice is ours
