A child born to die. An intervention from beyond the stars.

The sounds of the city are a cacophonous wall, an overbearing weight I can feel pressing down on me. I hide in the darkness, afraid to meet the world I never got to know. They are pursuing me, chasing after the things I carry in my blood, things that could undo this world.
I cannot let them have it.
In my wake, I have caught the lives of others, those who have chosen to stay with me. I am unsure if I am fit to protect to them, but it is one more reason I must continue to fight, even when I want nothing more than to give up.
I've been manipulated since the day I was born, my fate designed behind twenty-seven years of a carefully constructed facade. But I am not subject to these designs.
I don't believe in fate anyway.
