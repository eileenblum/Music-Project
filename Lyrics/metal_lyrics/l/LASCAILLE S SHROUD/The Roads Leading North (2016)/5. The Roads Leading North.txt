Escaping the city, Elizabeth ends up in a massive sprawl of a city. She exhausts herself reaching it, and on the threshold of the city limits, she passes out only to awaken later in the company of a group of homeless men and women.

For a time, she stays with them, hiding from the people who know pursue her. Mercenaries employed by the mysterious "Diaspora Initiative"

Eventually she is discovered, and one of the homeless, a nineteen year old girl named Szara is caught up in the crossfire. They are both forced to flee, Szara now wanted by association and Elizabeth unwilling to let them have her, as well as any information she might have.

[Elizabeth]
Biting winter winds cutting at my flesh
Head first into the storm, precipice of ends
Spirits start to fray, the burn of the cold
Dragged into the dark, tempting fate again
Running through the night, shadows on my trail
Unrelenting watch â Perpetual gaze
How long can I maintain and match my enemy?
I begin to fear I am full of regret

Slowly drifting in my empty mind
Voices I've never heard beckoning to me
Seconds turn to hours â hours turn to days
Every moment I begin to fade
Lifelessly I can feel my body dragged
Throbbing pain in my head
Sheathed in snow and unable to convey
My confusion and pain I cannot escape

The dancing of flames awakens the eyes
Squinting at the unfamiliar light
Foreign world with foreign eyes
An uncertain sense of whats to come

Confusion and fear widens my gaze
The assault of light
Ridden with loss, robbed of life
Now I am incomplete

[Compass]
Walking without direction
She directs her eyes at nothing
Just her cold feet along
The neon-light sidewalks
A wall of noise envelopes us
But she remains distant
Perpetual indecision and fear crippling

But deep within beyond the fear
We know that we cannot stay
Attached to us like a cancer
Their presence goes, wherever we go

[Elizabeth]
The city calls to me in alluring moans
The night-time begging me to lose myself in its throes

[Compass]
Quietly I watch as her world quickly turns
Questioning I wait as her world quickly burns

To the ground, reduced to ash
All that we know is we have to run
Safety and sanctuary eluding me
Will I be the death of this world?

[Elizabeth]
Months have gone by
Living in filth 'neath neon signs
In the shrouded darkness
Prolonging finality
A collection of broken egos
Clinging to naive optimism
Meandering lifelessly
Down lifeless roads

Biting winter winds cutting at my flesh
Head first into the storm, precipice of ends
Spirits start to fray, the burn of the cold
Dragged into the dark, tempting fate again
Running through the night, shadows on my trail
Unrelenting watch â Perpetual gaze
How long can I maintain and match my enemy?
I begin to fear I am full of regret

Suddenly faced with enormous weight
The burden of life on me
To assume I know where it is I go
I question their faith in me

[Compass]
From lifeless streets to lonely roads
Merely changing our aimlessness
To secure a sense of self
Where do these roads leading North go?
