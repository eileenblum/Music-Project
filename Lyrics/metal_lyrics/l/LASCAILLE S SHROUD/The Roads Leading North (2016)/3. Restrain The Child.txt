[The Doctor]
It does not yield - An unceasing wall
Archive of wealth, knowledge and death
Tempting the eager and weaker me
I don't even care to resist

[The Surgical Team:]
Can a child understand this kind of pain?
That inflicting it is really, the only way?
âStrange men surround and bound my limbs
A blur I hope that will end in my deathâ

[The Doctor:]
Denied the gates to the final frontier
The temptation to supersede prevails
Boundlessly contriving a way to access
The beguiling knowledge deep within

[The Surgical Team:]
Restrain the child and remove her bones
Enhance the mind to withstand the pain
At seven years old we create the slave
Implanted consensus ours to control

[The Doctor:]
A sharp external pain
Penetrates the flesh
âBlood removal processâ
Set to begin
Impoverished concepts
Drowned in a haze
Is it so unlikely that she will remember this pain?

Denied the gates to the final frontier
The temptation to supersede prevails
Obsessively plotting to one day possess
The enticing knowledge lying within

[The Surgical Team:]
Restrain the child and remove the veins
Enhance the mind to withstand her pain
At seven years old we create the slave
Implanted consensus ours to control

[Elizabeth North:]
Carbonized skeleton
Cyberized synapse points
Digital camera eyes
Image now realized
Artificial heart and blood
Imbuing life into this one

Awakening to my padded cell
Told to trust the words of these strange men
A terrified and pained little girl
Unable to remember who I am

[Elizabeth &amp; The Doctor:]
In the aftermath of an eternity
I feel something inside
I attempt to suppress
The incommodious in me

[Elizabeth &amp; The Surgical Team:]
My lungs draw air but I do not breathe
My eyes but for moments, ever open
Tired muscles I cannot contract
I have become living death
