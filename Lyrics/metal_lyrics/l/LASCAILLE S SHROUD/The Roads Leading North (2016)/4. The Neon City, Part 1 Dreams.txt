For twenty years, Elizabeth has lived a life in isolation at the research facility where Compass is held. She has little say in the matter, the technology keeping her alive is too precious, too advance, to allow it to roam the free world.

She has accepted this fate, and spent her life studying and learning from Compass.

But one day, she discovers a plot â set in motion by her father â with a shadowy corporation known as "The Diaspora Initiative", to harvest the technology within her.

Discovering she has been little more than a host for mere tech they wanted to keep for themselves, Elizabeth flees the facility towards the mighty Neon City. Compass, knowing the dangers of the technology within Elizabeth, leaves her vessel behind and travels with her, inside the colony of nanomachines keeping her alive in order to safeguard them.

The cubic vessel it leaves behind is rendered inert, useless to the people who once sought to exploit it.

[Diaspora]
Through the solarsphere and beyond the stars
New frontiers of unending knowledge
Out there beyond our sun
Lies the throne that our race will claim

A fall is a fall, is it not?
When failure is death is this justified?
Peace is peace?
Loss is loss, is it not?
Life is life, is it not?
Sacrifices are made â is that not always the way?

Breaking the skies and leaving this world behind
The trail of our engines will be followed
The path to the heavens is ours to pave
The world will look up and worship us

[Elizabeth]
A fissure across my weakly built
Idea of the world
Fracturing outwards
Reality cracks like glass

A fall is a fall, is it not?
When failure is death is this justified?
Peace is peace, is it not?
When achieved do means concern you at all?
Loss is loss, is it not?
Life is life, is it not?
Sacrifices are made â is that the only way?

[Diaspora]
No more thoughts â no more gods
Unnecessary automatons
No more death â and no more war
Irrelevant pasts expire

They will look up at the sky
Hand over eyes â in awe
Worshiping the trail that we leave
From the inferno of engines

[Elizabeth]
From my prison I can see
The melting lights of the Neon City
Extending a hand, the glass halts my grasp
I must escape, I must run, there is nothing for me here

My first steps onto this world
Endowing me with excitement and fear
But even the dirt beneath my feet
Is urging me to run

[Diaspora]
A fall is a fall, is it not?
When failure is death is this justified?
Peace is peace?
Loss is loss, is it not?
Life is life, is it not?
When achieved do means concern you at all?

[Elizabeth]
Braving the fear of an unknown world
A monstrous gaze that I must meet
All a facade I could not see, blinded by complacency
Into the lights of neon dreams â abandoning all
