The rigors of a life running from these mercenaries begins to take their toll. Elizabeth has always been plagued by odd symptoms from her surgery, the slight disconnect of alien technology and her biology. But they grow worse.

Pain.

But everyday, she must endure the pain if she wants to survive. If she wants both her and Szara to survive.

[Elizabeth]
I am so numbed by the pain
Constant permeation I cannot take
It never relents and never forgets
Scarless assault poisons my body

Invading my dreams, haunting my life
No aspect of me is left untouched
Woundless horror, unseen suffering
Some days I wonder why I endure

Seasons pass by me like afterthoughts
And still I wait, but nothing will change
The paroxysm comes likes waves eroding at my bones
Every step a struggle, every breath with pain

And in spite of the agony
I can still summon my rage
Brief moments uncontrolled
With vehemence I drone

And in spite of my agony
I can feel the world
Uttering disbelief
With vehemence they abhor
And in spite of my agony
I can still summon my rage
Lost moments uncontrolled
In vehemence I drone
Whispering into my ear
Wordless language spoken
Each syllable, a nerve ending torn
Each pause in speech my only relief

Screaming into my ear
Merciless language howled
Each hateful cry, a violent pang
Each breath between, my short relief
