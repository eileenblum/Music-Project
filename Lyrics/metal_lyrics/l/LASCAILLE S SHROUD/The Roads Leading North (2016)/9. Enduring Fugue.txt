The journey add is still long, and with a questionable resolution in sight. Elizabeth and Compass will face decisions that could alter the course of history forever.

I'm lost in a haze, my senses are blurred and fingertips numb. Movement seems impossible, I am anchored in place â¦ anchored in time. I exhale white clouds; the words I forget as soon as I speak them. There is a darkness encroaching â gathering â upon me. And though I am afraid, still I remain.
My identity shifts imperceptibly, and now I fear that I am lost.
I taste the essence of an absolute, and I forget how to fear. The terror does not stop me, though somewhere inside me I know that it should. Breaking my paralysis, I take one step forward and manage only to fall with the storm's rain. I feel cold again.
My identity shifts imperceptibly, and now I fear that I am lost.
