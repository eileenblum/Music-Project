[The Swarm]
Rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh, you touch my mind
Fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding
We are eternal. The pinnacle of evolution and existence
Before us you are nothing, your extinction is inevitable
We are the end of everything

My kind transcends your very understanding
We are each a nation: Independent, free of all weakness
You cannot even grasp the nature of our existence
We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution
You exist because we allow it
And you will end...

Because we demand it.

[Atlas Aetheriel:]
It all began as he drifted away
Passing by Saturn he saw them all
A massive armada dwarfing our worlds
Treading voids through to Earth

And then a voice, drew his focus
Distant and vague, an alien tongue

The words somehow, he understood

[Atlas Rigel:]
You will soon be the last, the only

[Vincent:]
Alien voices seeped inside
Whispering of impending doom
The universe inhales anxiously
To bate it's breath for the coming storm

[The Swarm:]
You only exist because we allow it
And you will end because we demand it

[Atlas Rigel:]
Follow the stars into dark space
Expand to survive, or conquer and die

[Atlas Aetheriel:]
Hands against the glass he watches on
As Mars is razed by the drifting swarm
Unseen watchers make their presence known
As the third child is soon consumed
Atlas Rigel
Your mind will be shaped to formlessness
To understand the concepts of eternity
You are the spatial architect
The ambassador of baryonic forms

[The Swarm:]
We will end you...

[Vincent:]
Alien voices blast their chords
Shouting of the impending doom
The universe exhaled a mighty wind
It's breath to become infinite storms

[The Swarm:]
You only exist because we allow it
And you will end because we demand it
A feeble attempt from the fleshy machines
Expand to survive, or fight and die

[Atlas Rigel:]
A gaze distant
Shifts...
It's focus

[The Swarm:]
Pulling against their laws and forces
Gravity, Light, Newton and Einstein
Admirable are your feeble attempts
But the Sovereign's eye, cannot allow this

We are infinite, undying
Limitless
You
Mere flesh
Pure bacteria

The insects on the anthill of Earth
Know not the forms, that they attract
Manipulate the laws in place
Shall bring a harbinger of pure destruction

[Atlas Rigel:]
The mind of man is trawled
The knowledge to rebuild
Recreate
Redefine
The cosmic law

[Vincent:]
What do you want with me?
Why have I been brought here?
Tell me now who you are!
Tell me what has happened!

[Atlas Rigel:]
All your worlds are cast to ash
Everything you know, gone!

[Vincent:]
This cannot be happening
What about everything I left?

[Atlas Aetheriel:]
There is nothing that can be done
All that remains is space and them

[Vincent / Atlas Rigel:]
Why all this? Why me?
You are the one who must rebuild

[Atlas Aetheriel:]
Sovereigns unknown swarm the sun
Their vast numbers have darkened our sky
Massive machines dwarf our worlds
And wrap their arms around the shell of Earth

The sky goes black and a shadow is cast
The human race is pushed into dark

Sovereign's arms slowly crush the Earth
Cracks cross continents like erupting veins

[Vincent:]
Alien voices blast their chords
To sanctify our impending doom
Cosmic prophet of galactic law
Declaration of sentient death

[The Swarm:]
You only exist because we allow it
And you will die because we demand it
A feeble attempt from the fleshy machines
leaves a tiny mark on the cosmic time line

[Atlas Rigel:]
Their gaze, distant
Shifts...
It's focus

The Swarm
There is a realm of existence so far beyond your own you cannot even imagine it
I am beyond your comprehension, I am Sovereign.
