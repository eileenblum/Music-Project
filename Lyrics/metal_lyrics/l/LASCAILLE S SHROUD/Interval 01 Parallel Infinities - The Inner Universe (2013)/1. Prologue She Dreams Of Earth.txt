[Sarah Tereshkova:]
I stand in awe at the might of Earth
Immense structures adorn her
My life and love lies here
Yet never can I return

Never will I know your green again?
Never can I return to you?
Never will I bathe in your seas?
Never can I breathe your air?

Every night I beg for this
To return to our home
Every day I cry for this
What have we done to you?

Barren wastes 'neath my boots
Dusty wind against the sky
Cracked view from the gas mask
I can finally see my Earth

A thousand shades of a lifeless hue
Oceans dried and forests gone
Murder the mountains and rape the sky
To make way for the acid rain

A thousand shades of a lifeless hue
Oceans dried and forests gone
Murder the mountains and rape the sky
To make way for your doomsday

My life and my love lies here
Yet never can I return
