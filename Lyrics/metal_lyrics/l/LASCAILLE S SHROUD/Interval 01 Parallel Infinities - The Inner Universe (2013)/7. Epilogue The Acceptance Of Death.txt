[Atlas Rigel]
The tides of an unearthly shore
The lull of gentle waves
Slipping eternally
Into their embrace

[Atlas Aetheriel:]
Nothing you have ever loved
Will ever be the same
Fire to replace the sky
And ashes as the sea
Clouds will break as new day dawns
And reign down death as rain
The beauty of time and space
Violated, tortured and...

[Atlas Rigel:]
Skies cracked wide
Star eater descends
Erasing existence
In the jaws of nothing

[Atlas Aetheriel :]
Nothing you have ever known
Can compare to this
Fire as if water washes over
The cities of man
Twilight's birth will negate
Any and all resistance
The galaxy crying
Unwillingly she accepts death

[Vincent:]
Burning in cosmic dust
We return to what we were
Sadness and beauty
The new existential canvas

The might and power of all mankind
Put to death under starlight

Falling star
Incinerate all

And in one single instant
The skies are set ablaze
In tears prepared to die

Burning in cosmic dust
We return to what we were
For five thousand years I must suffer
I pray for my own death
