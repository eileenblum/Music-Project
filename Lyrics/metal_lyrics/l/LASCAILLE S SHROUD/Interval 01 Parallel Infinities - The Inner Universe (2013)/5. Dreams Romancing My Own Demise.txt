[Vincent]
I am compelled by a dark logic
My actions betray my words
Are these hands my own?
For they torture and kill

And what of this heart?
Pumping darkness
Is this mind my own?
A strange presence occupies it still

Can you hear me?

Do my victims feel pain
After I am done?
Do my victims feel fear
When they see my face?

[Fear and Disgust:]
When I am done do they know
That I thought nothing of them?
When they are dead do they know
That I would rather it be...

[Madness Observing Love:]
Chained down in the bowels of darkness
Death too simple for my Madness
I revel in her pain, excited by the strain
As she tugs and pulls, bleeds and cries
I love it all!

[Love In Chains:]
I can never see the light of the sun
The stars but a dream that I can never remember
The weight of fear, the extent of disgust
I have romanced my own demise

[Fear And Disgust:]
Do my victims know my name?
Do I haunt their final dreams?
Do they know that I didn't care?
Do they know I did it happily?

Are my victims remembered
After I have disposed their corpse?
Do my victims remember my face?
Do they know I'd rather it be me!

[Madness Observing Love:]
Chained down in the bowels of darkness
Death too simple for my Madness
I revel in her pain, excited by the strain
As she tugs and pulls, bleeds and cries
I love it all!

[Loving Madness:]
We are chained down in the pits of hell
The blackest union will take place here
Lost in agony, happily we breed deep inside each others sin
We care not for the world
We are romancing the fall of a universe!
