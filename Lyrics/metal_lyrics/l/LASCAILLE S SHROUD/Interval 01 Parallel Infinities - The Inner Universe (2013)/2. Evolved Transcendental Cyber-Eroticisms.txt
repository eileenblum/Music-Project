[Sarah]
Weâve awakened to a world of disease and madness
Our impending doom accelerates the decline of humanity
Swimming through galactic seas in preparation of war
Revelation macroscopic! We are not the gods we think are

[Vincent]
Diving inside of each other, DNA intimate
Seeing through the lovers eyes, Exceeding humanity
Light-speed through bloodstreams, impacting force upon the heart
Passion collides with nature, unstoppable progression

[Ignorance Of Man ]
You will pay in death
For your romantic conquest of circuitry
You will pay in blood
For your disregard of our law

[Vincent]
Creating life rising from empty tides
In nothingness a beautiful skyline born in the image of woman
Ignorance Of Man
You will die!
For your conquest of evolution

[Vincent]
Nature no longer can be applied
Evolution resides in choice
Hypothesize synthesis
To create without medium

[Ignorance Of Man ]
We will be the harbinger of your extinction

[Sarah]
Metallic skin soft as flesh
Artificial eyes bright with life
Legs of steel wrap around
The waists of a newborn race

[Vincent]
Caressing against her
Music of galactic choirs
Sinking into deep passion
Euphoric state found inside her
Embracing synthetic flesh
Feeling the pulse artificial

[Sarah]
Harmonious life rhythms
Two lives entwined as one
We've awakened to a world of fire and betrayal
Our impending doom accelerates the decline of sanity
Treading through galactic seas in preparation of war
Revelation macroscopic! We are not the ones you should scorn

[Vincent]
Diving inside of each other, DNA intimate
Seeing through the lovers eyes, Exceeding humanity
Immune to death: Evolution unbound
The perfect cure, but still I am late...
