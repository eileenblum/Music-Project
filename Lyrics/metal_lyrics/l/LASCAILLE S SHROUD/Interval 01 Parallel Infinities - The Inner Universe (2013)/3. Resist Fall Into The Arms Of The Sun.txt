[The Divider General]
Breathless and still - Do not make a sound
Motionless and terrified- Shaking erratically
Frantically your heart beats â Each pulse excites me
Let slip a single cry â A single cry...

[The Divider Squad]
Amorphous shadows stalking the planes
Of a realm unprepared and too young to know
The instrument of their demise

Our gaze into you just inches away
The blade resting softly against the throat
We are the phantoms haunting existence

[The Divider General]
I am watching you â Do you think I cannot see?
Sanctuary soon denied â Silent your death
Precious and beautiful â Life extinguished
But I grow impatient â Surmounting damnation

[The Divider Squad]
Thousands of bodies â Pyramid of blood
Those who remain are hunted down
Shrieks of death â Mortify!

[The Divider General]
Yet one signature still remains
A creature who does not fear her death
An entity who seeks to fight

[Sarah Tereshkova]
Through tears I must persist
The sounds of death echo
A cold wind on my spine
Gazing into the void

Obsessively I contrive
Knowing I will die
Burning out the infant star
Bringing down a sun

Obsessively I contrive
With me you all will die
Destroy the infant star
Bringing with me

Hell!
Will envelope all
Burn!
Away my sin
And Pray!
My death be swift
And Know!
They suffer great

[Fear Of Death]
Never will you see them again
Now will you hesitate?

[Acceptance Of Death]
I wish it could be some other way
I do not wish to die here like this
But if my death will bring them life
Then I happily surrender

[The Divider Squad]
Black hole grazing a Jovian
Deadly embrace

[Acceptance Of Death]
Seductive starlight beckoning
I never sought the cold distance

[Fear Of Death]
I leave a world in tears
Cold and fearful (Oh so cold...)
I leave love in tears
Scared and alone

A grand tragedy of time
To die as this (To die...)
To never know the hands
That drown the stars

[Transcending Death]
Deaths not my concern
For I am prepared to die
And when I am dead and gone
In passing I will evolve

[The Divider Squad]
False deities
Queen heretic
Never will you transcend

[The Divider Squad]
Inhuman you seem
Weakness will be found
Mother of sin put to death

[Sarah Tereshkova Transcending]
Perpetual sunlight
To burn away the eternal
Close my eyes, ignite the star
And never dream, never breathe
Fall into the arms of the sun
