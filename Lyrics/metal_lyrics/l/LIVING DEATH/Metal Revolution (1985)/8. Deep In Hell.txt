Any day you'll work alone for the second strain
The work in done and you're going home
Home for, for the night

Go in your room, climb into your leather, ride into the second race
Take your machine and drove in town
To take this ground down

You take so much
You hunting, hunting
They cry.....

Deep in Hell you're in the spotlight
Deep in Hell they cry
Deep in Hell you're full of power
Deep in Hell they die

You take the rock!

Deep in Hell you're in the spotlight
Deep in Hell they cry
Deep in Hell you're full of power
Deep in Hell they die

You want so much of all they can give
Oh, the neatest sound of screams so loud
To you when you come

They must feel, feel, feel the power what you deserve
They don't give up, burn all the money, for you shot 'em down

Deep in Hell you're in the spotlight
Deep in Hell they cry
Deep in Hell you're full of power
Deep in Hell they die

Oh, Deep in Hell
Oh, Deep in Hell
They're so Deep in Hell
So Deep, so Deep, so Deep in Hell
Deep in Hell
