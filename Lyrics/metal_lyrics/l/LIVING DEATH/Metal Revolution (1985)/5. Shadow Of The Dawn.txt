Go on, go on and break, go on and break the law
You see, see only a Shadow, I've got to kill them all
Shadow, Shadow of Dawn, Shadow of Dawn gone through
Shadow, Shadow of Dawn, Shadow of Dawn get you

You are, you are kill, you are kill for me
You feel, you feel the slidin', you feel the laughter high
Shadow, Shadow of Dawn, Shadow of Dawn gone through
Shadow, Shadow of Dawn, Shadow of Dawn rape you

Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow, Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow, Shadow of the Dawn....

Go sweat, go sweat so cold, go sweat so cold in the dark
Go run, running so fast, when the Shadow's gone down
Shadow, Shadow of Dawn, Shadow of Dawn gone through
Shadow, Shadow of Dawn, Shadow of Dawn kill you

Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow, Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow, Shadow of the Dawn...........

Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow, Shadow of the Dawn
Shadow, Shadow of the Dawn...........
