You see. Come on don't you see
Oh it looks like a nightmare, but it was real
When you feel in the night, taken by your sight
You turn out the light and start to cry

Oh, don't you see
I do it all, only for you
'Cause I love you like your manless man
You left me
I'm only aching so for you
Yeah, you banished me like a fool
Since the day, hey, you left me you never, never see
'Cause I do only for love...

Oh, don't you see
I love you real but my time will show
Through the man who walked my second life
Since the day, hey, you left me you never, never see
'Cause I do only for love

Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart

Like I will!

Since the day, hey, you left me you never, never see
'Cause I do only for love
Grippin' A Heart

You have even
Oh you are so young
Baby in jail
It was yours on the wall

Go, go out on the street out now
Screaming out of you
Get the point and all
And you must see........ yeah
Said you do only for love
Grippin' A Heart

Oh, don't you see, right
The people laughing about me
When they see what you doin' to me
You left me
Since this day I've never loved
'Cause only you who spoiled the love
Since the day, hey, you left me you never, never see
'Cause I do only for love

Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart

Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart

Grippin' A, Grippin' A, Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A, Grippin' A, Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A, Grippin' A, Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A, Grippin' A Heart
