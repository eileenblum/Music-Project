Dark dust, crumbled old black rocks
All creature waken to me
What never see day.......
Through moisturing caves there were
The Black Knights riding out, out into night
Steeds of virtue everywhere....

Dark dust
Black rocks
All creature
We never see again

All place where they come from
Look like the world devistation
The terrible screams opens the rocks, rocks, rocks
Through moisturing caves there were
Sneering leper, get out of the war
Virgins dream when they can't teach old men

Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Ah ha ha ha ha
Screaming from a Chamber

Dark dust, crumbled old black rocks
All creature waken to me
What never see day......
Through moisturing caves there were
The Black Knights riding out, out into night
Steeds of virtue everywhere.....

Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Ah ha ha ha ha
Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber

All place where they come from
Looks like world devistation
Terrible screams opens the rocks, rocks, rocks
Through moisturing caves there were
Sneering leper, get out of the war
Virgins dream when they can't teach old men

Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Ah ha ha ha ha
Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming - Screaming - Screaming from a Chamber

Screaming from a Chamber
Screaming from the black rocks
Screaming from you....
