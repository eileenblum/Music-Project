Drinking with the Devil
You must try to win
All the Earth and in Hell the past
You look like and outlaw
No one had a chance against you
As they see you running wild

On the street you're the world's best-of-all
All that can fear this, what they see

Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come

Rulers start erasing
When you're perfect
The metal power bangs their heads
You must take them all on
In town you're met so tough
There they are that's running wild

On the street you're the world's best-of-all
All that can fear this, what they see

Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come

Rulers Must Come - make it in Hell
Rulers Must Come - going down
Rulers Must Come - we cry
Rulers Must Come - oh come

Hell...Hell...Hell - you've been in Hell
Hell...Hell...Hell - oh you're going to Hell
Hell...Hell...Hell - you're going to Hell
Hell...Hell...Hell

Death of man who holds it
Must feel it now
Then you all, you're mine, all the Earth
Every man we're talking
You try it now to cross our way
Then out calls "We're Living Death!"

On the street you're the world's best-of-all
All that can fear this, what they see

Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come
Rulers Must Come

Rulers Must Come - really must
Rulers Must Come - come and die
Rulers Must Come - we'll all be damned
Rulers Must Come - must come
