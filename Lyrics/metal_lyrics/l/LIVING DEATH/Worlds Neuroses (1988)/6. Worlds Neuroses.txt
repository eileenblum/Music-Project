Schizophrenic minds of human kind
Abnormal reactions control the minds
Of apparently normal people
But don't you know all people are equal

Neuroses - Worlds Neuroses
Neuroses - Worlds Neuroses

What to do with somebody disgusting you
Thinkin' he's not the one to live with you
Your abnormal feelings torture your brain
Workin' out a plan, you do what you can

Ironical observes destroy your facade
Before you start tricks you're going under the blade
Neurotical symptoms are in everyone
Nobody knows about things he had done
