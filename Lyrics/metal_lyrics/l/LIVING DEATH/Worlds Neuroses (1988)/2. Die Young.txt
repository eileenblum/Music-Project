You're aged fifteen and wanna do everything that
Mom and Dad were never able to do
No one who stops you, live your life, and realize
Your teenage dreams
Don't care about the world and societies problems
'Cause it makes no difference to you
If friends are long haired junkies or short haired drunkies
'Cause they all live their life too

We're young - you're old
Go out of our way
If your want to find your eternal peace - Do it!
We don't care

We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old
We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old

In the morning at school you are searching the guy
Who's selling your favorite drug
At 10 school is over for you, 'cause you don't wanna learn
Things you never could change
At home one more time you must hear all the things you must do
Or especially not
So you better move to town where you meet your crowd
In which everyone is thinkin' like you

We're young - you're old
Go out of our way
But you want to find your eternal peace - Do it!
We don't care

We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old
We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old

You ask yourself 'Why don't they leave me alone
With my life and with my dreams'
Even if Mom and Dad are going out they pass no chance
To declare what it seems
To have a child like you that doesn't care about his life
A nasty, crazy fool
You are laughing at 'em, we're all laughing at 'em
They're not for us! - Their morbid rules

We're young - you're old
Go out of our way
But you want to find your eternal peace - Do it!
We don't care

We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old
We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old

We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old
We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old
We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old
We all will - Die Young
There's no sense in growin' old

Die Young
Die Young
Die Young
Die Young
