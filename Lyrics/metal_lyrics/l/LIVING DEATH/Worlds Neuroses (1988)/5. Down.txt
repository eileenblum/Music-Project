I saw you first time in a dinner hall
You looked like a girl that will never fall
You smiled a sweet smile as I touch your hand
Never thought about that you'll drive me mad
I saw you first time in a dinner hall
You looked like a girl that will never fall

You - gimme what you got to give
You - bring me into seventh heaven
I - follow you and I believe
I - got to beat you never

You're doing things turnin' me around
But you were bringin' me - Down
I've found it out what it's all about
The way you're treatin' me - Down

You're doing things turnin' me around
But you were bringin' me - Down
I've found it out what it's all about
The way you're treatin' me - Down

We had good times, all days and nights
Often ending in strong fights
I never knew a girl like you
But baby, I'm not lovin' you

You - only give if you can take
And You - will bring me down one day
I will - treat you like you do
'Cause I - will be the illness for you

You're doing things turnin' me around
But you were bringin' me - Down
I've found it out what it's all about
The way you're treatin' me - Down

You're doing things turnin' me around
But you were bringin' me - Down
I've found it out what it's all about
The way you're treatin' me - Down

You - only give if you can take
And You - will bring me down one day
I will - treat you like you do
'Cause I - will be the illness for you

You get more weak under my hand
We do a nice trip into horror land
C'mon little baby drink your wine
And recognize that your body's mine

You - gimme what you got to give
And I - bring you into seventh heaven
Now You - follow me and must believe
That I - treat you if it's right for me

Now I'm doing things, turning me around
And I will bring you - Down
Have you found it out what it's all about?
The way I'm treatin' you - Down

Now I'm doing things, turning me around
And I will bring you - Down
Have you found it out what it's all about?
The way I'm treatin' you - Down

Now I'm doing things, turning me around
And I will bring you - Down
Have you found it out what it's all about?
The way I'm treatin' you

Down
