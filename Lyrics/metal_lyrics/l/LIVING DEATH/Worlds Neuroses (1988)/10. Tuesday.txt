Sunday I go to meet little Sally
And I jump up the stairs 'cause I wanna tell her
I wonder if we can start another waterbed rally
Sally laughs and what she says ain't a lie

Ride me till I cry
Push the pen, push the pen as high as you really can
Dive into my funny side

She opens her lips and the hot sweet taste
Makes me forget about the energy I waste
Feelin' better now 'cause I know the way how
To help her find the highest point and she screams loud

Ride me till I cry
Push the pen, push the pen as high as you really can
Dive into my funny side

What you gonna do on Tuesday?
I relax my brain before I go insane
She was so, she was so, she was fine
Get ready for doing it everyday
Not everyday, it's not my way
You will try, you will try, Yeah I'll try

Day after day, the silly old game
But Sally wants more, it's always the same
Sixty-nine, real fine, she got hers and I got mine
"Right boy make me shine, it's better now for me to die

Ride me till I cry
Push the pen, push the pen as high as you really can
Dive into my funny side

What you gonna do on Tuesday?
I relax my brain before I go insane
She was so, she was so, she was fine
Get ready for doing it everyday
Not everyday, it's not my way
You will try, you will try, Yeah I'll try

What you gonna do on Tuesday?
I relax my brain before I go insane
She was so, she was so, she was fine
Get ready for doing it everyday
Not everyday, it's not my way
You will try, you will try, Yeah I'll try

Ride me till I cry
Push the pen, push the pen as high as you really can
Dive into my funny side

The time is right today to take it to an end, okay
If Sally is sleepin' tight, I change her with a rubber maid
No more horror bedroom fights, rubber maids tell no tales
I touch her sweet rubber skin and slowly she starts to sing

Ride me till I cry
Push the pen, push the pen as high as you really can
Dive into my funny side

What you gonna do on Tuesday?
I relax my brain before I go insane
She was so, she was so, she was fine
Get ready for doing it everyday
Not everyday, it's not my way
You will try, you will try, Yeah I'll try

What you gonna do on Tuesday?
I relax my brain before I go insane
She was so, she was so, she was fine
Get ready for doing it everyday
Not everyday, it's not my way
You will try, you will try, Yeah I'll try

She was so, she was so, she was so, she was so...
She was so, she was so, she was so, she was so...
She was so, she was so, she was so, she was so...
She was so, she was so, she was so, she was so...
