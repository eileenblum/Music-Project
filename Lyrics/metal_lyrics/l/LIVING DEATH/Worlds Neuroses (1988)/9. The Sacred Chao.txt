The sphere of confusion, special agent in charge
Bureaucracy and aftermath, spirit advisor
The sphere of chaos, grand illuminatus
The sphere of discord, keeper of the Sacred Chao

They're workin' together for the magic Pentagon
Confusion the first, bureaucracy the second
Aftermath number three, chaos and discord
They're workin' together for the magic Pentagon
Helper and accomplice for the end of the world
No one of the puppets knows what is done
The end is comin' slow and no one feels the hurt

The Sacred Chao
The Sacred Chao....
The Sacred Chao
The Sacred Chao....

For searching the rear-rank men, you'll pay with your life
And if you find one, there are ten new of 'em behind
You find a track but it goes lost in darkness
You think you're workin' alone, you fall in helpless

They're workin' together for the magic Pentagon
The sphere of confusion, bureaucracy and aftermath
Chaos and discord, the end of the world
They're workin' together for the magic Pentagon
Helper and accomplice for the end of the world
No one of the puppets knows what is done
The end is comin' slow and no one feels the hurt

The Sacred Chao
