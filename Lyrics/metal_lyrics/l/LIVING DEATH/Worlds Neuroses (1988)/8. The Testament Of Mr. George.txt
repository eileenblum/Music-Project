Fourteen family members sitting 'round the table
The testament opening is starting soon 'cause George is dead forever
Everyone wants the price for himself, the views of 'em show all
And if someone is handicapped the others have to fall

Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right
Who's the one only getting money if the others die
Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right

The Notary starts to read out the holy testament
Everyone's ears are growing big, every now and then
Thirteen meritables are enumerated, only one is left
Johnathan begins to know that he's unnecessary

A few days later he starts a diner and everyone of 'em comes
To show them that he's not angry, he knows what he does
He poisons the wine, for him it's a game
He only wants his right, 'til the end of this night

Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right
Who's the one only getting money if the others die
Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right

They celebrate and drink the wine and when they're all fallen down Johnathan's laughing loud

Now the revenge is coming to an end and Johnathan begins to build up a wall in the door

Then he opens a bottle of wine in the hall and cheers up to Mr. George...

Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right
Who's the one only getting money if the others die
Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right
Who's the one only getting money if the others die
Family war. Mr. George cheats 'em right
Who's the one only getting money if the others die

Family War. Family War. Family War
