My heart is burning hot, but you don't love me
I want to try up, but you made me stop
I read in every letter that you were a slattern
And I'm not slight, I hold, hold you tight

When you're skulking, you planned a bad thing
And in you eyes I see the lies
Take some advice before you pay the price
And your desperation, for me a sensation

You And Me, the Devil see
You And Me, I wanna be free
You And Me, the Devil see
Me And You

My heart is burning hot, but you don't love me
I want to try up, but you made me stop
I read in every letter that you were a slattern
And I'm not slight, I hold, hold you tight

You And Me, the Devil see
You And Me, I wanna be free
You And Me, the Devil see
Me And You

When you're skulking, you planned a bad thing
And in you eyes I see the lies
Take some advice before you pay the price
And your desperation, for me a sensation

My heart is burning hot, but you don't love me
I want to try up, but you made me stop
I read in every letter that you were a slattern
And I'm not slight, I hold, hold you tight

You And Me, the Devil see
You And Me, I wanna be free
You And Me, the Devil see
Me And You

When you're skulking, you planned a bad thing
And in you eyes I see the lies
Take some advice before you pay the price
And your desperation, for me a sensation

You And Me
You And Me
You And Me
You And Me
You And Me
You And Me
You And Me
You And Me....
