She said to me if I couldn't see
And deep in the night when I turned out the light
She came near and nearer, and in my dreams I see her
But she didn't know, she thinks it was my show...
My show, and she thinks it was my show

I whispered in her ear that she don't have to fear
I try hard to tell her that I won't go leave her
She came near and near a-ha-ha-ha, and in my dreams I see her
But she didn't know, she thinks it was my show...

Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light

She said to me if I couldn't see
And deep in the night when I turned out the light
She came near and nearer, and in my dreams I see her
But she didn't know, she thinks it was my show...

Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
Night Light
[and again many more times!]
