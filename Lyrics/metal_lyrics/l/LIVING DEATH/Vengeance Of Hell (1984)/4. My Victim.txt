He runs, she runs, all the other people run
And you hear with your ear, that they all must have fear
You couldn't tell when I spell all the victims in the hell

My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance

On the world I'm the earl when it comes to killing girls
When they lie, I must try, that they have all to die
When I came on my flame and they were never seen again

You cry, short before you die

Run from me when you see that you'll be my enemy
It is real when you feel that I will your life steal
And you hope since my show that I love you no, no, no
Then I say in this way that I'll kill you here today

You cry, short before you die

Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you

My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance
My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance

You cry, short before you die

My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance
My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance

You cry, short before you die

Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you

You cry, short before you die

My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance
My victim, my victim, you are living without a chance
My victim, my victim, you will die at you helldance

You cry, short before you die

Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you
Come over you....
