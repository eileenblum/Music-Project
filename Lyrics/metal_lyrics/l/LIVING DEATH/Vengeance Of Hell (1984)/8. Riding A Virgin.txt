Come and hear the story about a girl
Which found her first love in me...

Saw her on the street, she was what I need
She looked so fine, she must me mine

Six pm she hears me say that I will love her everyday
She was the best, what I've seen
In my dreams she was the Queen

Some good time ago, you all, all don't know
In my bed it was so red...

Riding a virgin it was too late
Riding a virgin she lost it in my bed

She was only fifteen when I killed her screen
But it wasn't bad because she drove me mad

Since these days we go the way
Our whole life long, we'll love us so strong
