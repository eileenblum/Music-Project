Three years ago
She did it for show
It didn't take along way
Till she made it every day

Three years ago
She'd raving madness
It was her death blow
She's a Living Death

The drugs you see, her deadly enemy
Her will to live was less, you know she is Living Death
I saw her danger stuff, it was for her too much
Then she lost her soul, Devil has his crown, his crown, his crown, his crown

One day ago, she looked so low
I think I'm crazy when I see her again
I run after her, through the dark lanes
Then I looked at her, she is Living Death, so Death, so Death, so Death

The drugs you see, her deadly enemy
Her will to live was less, you know she is Living Death
I saw her danger stuff, it was for her too much
Then she lost her soul, Devil has his crown, his crown, his crown, his crown

One day ago, she looked so low
I think I'm crazy when I see her again
I run after her, through the dark lanes
Then I looked at her, she is Living Death, so Death, so Death you know, so Death

The drugs you see, her deadly enemy
Her will to live was less, you know she is Living Death
I saw her danger stuff, it was for her too much
Then she lost her soul, Devil has his crown, his crown, his crown, his crown

Try to help her fast when I saw her last
Kill her poisoned soul, Devil must now fall
I loved her so, she's forever gone
She was all for me, now she's final free, so free , so free, so free

Free
