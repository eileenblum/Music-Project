I see it in the night
When all wars end the fight
You see it too

The moon stood high, it was no lie
When I tell it's so shy
I'm warning you

They came so quick, like a trick
The people run before they die
I hear you cry

It was a slough, I'd never thought
The people bleed in the wet
I could not act

It was a battle like heavy metal
All the freaks banged their heads
So I want to see
Heavy Metal Hurricane
In the hell and back again
Heavy Metal Hurricane
Bloody action see again

I see it in the night
When all wars end the fight
You see it too

The moon stood high, it was no lie
When I tell it's so shy
I'm warning you

It was a battle like heavy metal
All the freaks banged their heads
So I want to see
Heavy Metal Hurricane
In the hell and back again
Heavy Metal Hurricane
Bloody action see again

I see it in the night
When all wars end the fight
You see it too

The moon stood high, it was no lie
When I tell it's so shy
I'm warning you

They came so quick, like a trick
The people run before they die
I hear you cry

It was a slough, I'd never thought
The people bleed in the wet
I could not act

It was a battle like heavy metal
All the freaks banged their heads
So I want to see
Heavy Metal Hurricane
In the hell and back again
Heavy Metal Hurricane
Bloody action see again

It was a battle like heavy metal
All the freaks banged their heads
So I want to see
Heavy Metal Hurricane
In the hell and back again
Heavy Metal Hurricane
Bloody action see again
