He comes up
Out of Hell
Hold it for
Hold it for spell

Centuries ago
A holy man
Had a big fight
With his ancestor

Vengeance of Hell, Vengeance of Hell, you all
Vengeance of Hell, Vengeance of Hell, must die

He comes up
Out of Hell
All men who saw
Hold it for spell

Centuries ago
A holy man
Had a big fight
With his ancestor

Vengeance of Hell, Vengeance of Hell, you all
Vengeance of Hell, Vengeance of Hell, must die
Vengeance of Hell, Vengeance of Hell, you all
Vengeance of Hell, Vengeance of Hell, must die

I wanna tell you about a man who's ancestor
Had a big fight with a holy man centuries ago
Now he comes from deep up out of his dark realm
And on the whole world the holy men start to run
When they saw the vengeance in his eyes

Run, run, run, run, run, run...
