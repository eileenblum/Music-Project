He runs through the dark lanes
Kills the people without a chance
Then you have nothing to win
When he comes to begin

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

He comes deep, deep from hell
When you're there you're nothing to tell
He takes your blood not too small
Paints with it all the walls

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

He rules your way since these days
From the sky deep in his realm
He grabbed the bowels out of you
You're screaming like your funeral song

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

He takes your blood not too small
Paints with it all the walls
He grabbed the bowels out of you
You're screaming like your funeral song

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike...

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

He runs through the dark lanes
Kills the people without a chance
Then you have nothing to win
When he comes to begin

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

He comes deep, deep from hell
When you're there you're nothing to tell
He takes your blood not too small
Paints with it all the walls

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike
Hellpike, Hellpike

Hellpike, Hellpike, Hellpike, Hellpike
