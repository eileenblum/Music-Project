Once you cross this unstoppable force
Make me your god bring me on my knees
It feels so tight you can't tear me away
Make me your god bring me on my knees
Fuck it, I can't say no, I lost my sanity
I feel the power overwhelm my body
I just sit back close my eyes and let the madness rage!
And I hope one day it will fuckin' be alright
