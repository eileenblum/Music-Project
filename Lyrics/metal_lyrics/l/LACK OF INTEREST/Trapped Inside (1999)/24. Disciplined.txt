Day has fallen and night will come
I feel the tension growing deep inside of me
Beware because with my fury
'Comes the pain you like inflicted
Once in my hold the things I wanna do
I let you know just where you stand
Don't fight the urge
Give in to your needs
And for your pleasure you'll make me bleed
