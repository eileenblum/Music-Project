What's this I see
You're fuckin' here
You have the nerve
To come around and show your face
I really think you're not so tough
But you keep talking shit
After slamming a couple beers
Stay away from me with your crap
'Cause unlike anyone else
I will snap
What are you doing here
Why won't you leave
What is your point
And who do you have to prove it to
How much longer take the hint
I may have to use my fist!
