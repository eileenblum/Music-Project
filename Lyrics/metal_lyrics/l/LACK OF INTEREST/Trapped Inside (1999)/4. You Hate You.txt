Damn this world and what it has for me
Love -- Hate -- In life
I can show it all to you but you refuse to see
Corruption -- Destruction
You are the driver of your own destiny
Why do you need me
I don't need you
Don't waste your time
Just save what you have to say
'Cause I know the whole world
Seems like it's coming down on you
But there's nothing I can do
You just hate you
