You're all around me but
Even with you right here I feel alone
Can't see inside me
Show no one your soul I've been told
You can't trust me
'Cause I'm sick and tired of my life
So much is wrong
I'm tired of spending all my time
Trying to make it right so sometimes
Why even bother with this fuckin' shit
When pieces of your shattered life has been denied
Sure I'll get some help someday
And just maybe I'll be ok
What's wrong
Just show me the way
What's wrong
I'll tell you the truth
