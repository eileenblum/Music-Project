When will you stand on your own two feet
'Cause life is cruel and nothing comes cheap
Fuck up your life... decide
No one really knows you've been doing it for so long
Take what you can fuckin' get
'Cause now you just accept it
To be given handouts as
You walk in through the door
Never satisfied with results
You want more
It's one thing you have no money
And your boys look out for you
But take that shit for granted
And in the end your friends are through
Believe it
