We all fear to hear the truth
But we all just can't ignore
They lead you to believe
Their Ignorant solutions
To spend billions for our weapons
Strongest nation
Feeding other countries
When there's people dying and starving
In your own backyard
If we all don't change this life
With war we'll always need shelter
