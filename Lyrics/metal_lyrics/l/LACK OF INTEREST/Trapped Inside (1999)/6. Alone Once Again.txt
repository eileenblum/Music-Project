Oh my god what has become
Of this one I call my love
Once together an unstoppable force
Now it's all been taken away
Feel so empty in my life and in my heart
You have left me all alone
I want you to return
Oh my god what has become
Of this one I call my love
Once together an unstoppable force
Now it's all been taken away
Without you in my life
I'll never be the fuckin' same
