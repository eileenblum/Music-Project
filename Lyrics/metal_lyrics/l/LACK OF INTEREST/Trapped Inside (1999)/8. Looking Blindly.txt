Betrayed!!!
All my life's respects
All I know there must be
A divine point to it all and
It's just over my head
Could it be I can't accept things
For what they are
Or am I just fucking losing my mind
'Cause life is filled with goodbyes
And it hurts every fuckin' time
It seems that I lost so much
I need something new to lose
I fuckin' see most people's lives
Are a great disappointment to them
And no one leaves this earth
Without feeling terrible pain
Never give up
Never give in
'Cause life Is filled with goodbyes
And it hurts every fuckin' time so
Be prepared for what's to come
