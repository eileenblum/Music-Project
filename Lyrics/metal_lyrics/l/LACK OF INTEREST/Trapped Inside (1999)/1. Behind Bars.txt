They say what they have to
To have you where they want you
When I'm behind bars you become such a big man
Don't talk back, if you do you're through
Taken in a room and have their way with you
When I'm behind bars you become such a big man
Fuck the authority
There's no justice
We have no money so we struggle most of our lives
You say you're here to protect and serve
But it's all a fucking lie
Fuck the authority
There's no justice
