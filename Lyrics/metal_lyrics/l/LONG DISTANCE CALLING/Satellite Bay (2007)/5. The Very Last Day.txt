[Excerpt from the narrator text of the A.I. film opening]

Those were the years after the icecaps had melted because of the greenhouse gases.
And the oceans had risen to drown so many cities along all the shorelines of the world.
Amsterdam, Venice, New York...

Amsterdam, Venice, New York...
...forever lost.
