[Excerpt from a monologue by the Log Lady (Twin Peaks)]

Can you see through a wall? Can you see through human skin? X-rays see through solid, or so-called solid objects.
There are things in life that exist, and yet our eyes cannot see them. Have you ever seen something startling that others cannot see? Why are some things kept from our vision? Is life a puzzle? I am filled with questions. Sometimes my questions are answered. In my heart, I can tell if the answer is correct. I am my own judge.
In a dream, are all the characters really you? Different aspects of you? Do answers come in dreams?
