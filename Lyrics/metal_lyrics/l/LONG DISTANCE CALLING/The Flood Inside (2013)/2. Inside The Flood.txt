Knew it's the long way to choose
Waiting, loathing that you wouldn't guide me
Abuse what made it true
Waking, hoping that you would light my way

Home fading, drifting the moment I came to
Losing patience too
No more, no less than this won't pay for me

Late when all hell is breaking loose
And I still be searching
Knew that it always ends up hollow
The days I slither into the ooze

Begging for a different life to borrow
The flood inside, it drowns me in the nude

The flood inside, it drowns me slow
I knew I'm tired, it's time to go

Finding all of the answers
Taken over the game
Crashing on all of the fences
You wouldn't lie to me

Hide it all under water
Stumbling on this chase
As terrifying as this trace is
You still guide me

Waiting, knowing that you wouldn't guide me
Knew it's the long way to choose
Late as the night, it's maddening me

Home
Home
Home

Knew that it always ends up hollow
The flood inside, it drowns me in the nude
