something is gone
something may end
in order for something
new to begin
these times overwhelming
to the eye of your mind
the world as we know it
leave us behind

it's the darkness inside
that creates the light
it's the fear in your heart
that you have defied
no one can stop the fall
no one can freeze here today
you have to face it
and welcome the change

in the clear light of dawn
emerging from night
as the silence speaks
we rise with the tide
the ushering flow
to wash it all away
the fear falls behind us
and hope leads the way

it's the darkness inside
that creates the light
it's the fear in your heart
that you have to fight
no one can stop the fall
no one can freeze here today
you have to face it
and welcome the change

it's the darkness inside
that creates the light
it's the fear in your heart
that you have defied
no one can stop the fall
no one can stare inside
you have to face it
and welcome the flood
