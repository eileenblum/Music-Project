Depressing loathing, destructive desire
Suicidal instincts, hate from inside strangles, strangles me.
Slow death is the deformed fate of humanity
This filthy earth smells cadaverous

I am filled with disgust towards humanity
Itâs no place for pity, this race evokes scorn.
Slow death is the deformed fate of humanity
This filthy earth smells, smells cadaverous

It can be heard the last breath of earth
It can be feel the mass loss of humanity
Here neither death is redemption
Slow torment, never-ending destruction.
