Our obscure paganâ¦ pagan pastâs
In ruins dying bloodfreezing castle
Deathlike silenced land of living deads
An evil empire is shining in the mountains

Transylvaniaâs forest gem
Scene of ancientâ¦ancient rituals

Itâs glittering so individual
Proud and orphan
Lamenting our pagan victory

Transylvaniaâs forest gem
Scene of ancientâ¦ ancient rituals

Our past is alreadyâ¦ already in ruins
Hard silence of oblivion has descended on it
In the mist is circling the prayer of the ancestors
The shadows of past are praying in the fog

Transylvaniaâs forest gem
Scene of ancientâ¦ ancient rituals
