The past haunts me which boils my blood
Our forefathers proud dream has been left into oblivionâ¦
That to never praise any divinity
Follow the cult of Turul pride

They allowed to legacy to keep the flame of heathenism
And to not choose any godâs yoke
Where disappeared our pride
Follow the cult of Turul pride

Devastation to all false religion!
Itâs shameful that we lead into oblivion our roots
Pain is washing our late proudnessâ¦
Follow the cult of Turul pride!
