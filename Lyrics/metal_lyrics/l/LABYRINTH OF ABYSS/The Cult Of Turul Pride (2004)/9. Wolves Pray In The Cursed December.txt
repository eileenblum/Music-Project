Grim woods dephtâs echoes
From the wolves pray
Boils my blood with unmerciful hate
War scream flies in the freezing winds
I feel the temptation to draw me in the abyss

The pale light of the moon lights my way
Graveless silenceâ¦i hear the forestâs breath
Ravens macabre dance cover the frozen landscapes
The landscape of cursed December

Iâm one with the fog, i hear the hangedâs hymns
Sicul rebel heartâ¦ itâs colder than iceâ¦
Snow covered mountains keep this empireâs treasure
The moon spreads itâs funeral light
Over the Hargita.
