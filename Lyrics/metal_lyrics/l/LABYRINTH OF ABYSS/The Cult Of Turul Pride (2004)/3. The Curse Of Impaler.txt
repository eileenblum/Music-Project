Standing under the spell of the fullmoon
Your soul is blessed with eternal life
And you feel the ancient spirit
Passing through your soul!

Like a son of nightmarish dream of the abyss
You are the eternal slave of temptation and blood
You feel the unrestrained infernal power
In your damned heart you carry all the sins of humanity

Neither the cross can cause damage in your evil soul
Son of moonlight, prince of wolves
Pride of bloodfreezing Transylvania
Be always the enemyâ¦the enemy of light!
