Deformed face from the terrorâ¦
In captivity of fear and on the verge of insanity
Between the cold walls of the terror-empire
In my dark tunnels guides me the voice of fire
You feel how death inhales
Your rottingâ¦ rotting soul

From the grotesque damp stone walls
Inhuman voices are leaking across
Before your eyes you can see
The endless anger of the katharsis

You wake up between the flames
But you canât feel heat around you
This is just the beginning of the journey
Everything became dust behind youâ¦
