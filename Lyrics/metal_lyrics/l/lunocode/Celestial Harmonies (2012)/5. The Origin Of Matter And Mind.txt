[Part I: On Matter And Mind]

[Instrumental]

[Part II: High]

A strange sensation runs through my veins for the first time
I've never felt like this
I don't know what this means
I woke up in this cold place containing no one but me

It's all so empty outside
Between you and me
O blue and silent sun

And suddenly
Everything is becoming weightless
My hands are floating in front of me and
I watch them paralyzed

A growing sense of panic
Wraps around my throat
I just don't know what's happening
I just feel imprisoned here

I don't know what to do while
The blue sun transforms
Into a pulsating light
Getting closer and closer to me
I feel my chest exploding
And my eyes breaking into millions of shards

In every shard I see my face
Before it breaks again

A rhythmic sound out of the dark
A drum from the depths of my heart
I see billions of shards floating around
By the rule of one hundred and thirty-seven

They form sequences unknown
And the blue sun transforms
And becomes an eye scanning darkly
Through the eons
While I flow through it

[Part III: The Cosmic Architect]

Out of the darkness
Out of the silent chaos
Black letters emerge
An artist's signature in a pale scarlet white field
Powerful light burned in the past
I'll never catch a glimpse of it again
But something is emerging from the cracks of my mind

The origin of matter and life
The fractal nature of a mind in the mind
A drop in the ocean that makes the water shine
A pale simulacrum of a cosmic architect

The light is changing
The light is standing still now
Pale shades of another reality are forming
Crystallized energy
Encoding the structure of the world
Deep inside the transcendental sequence
A perfect circle of unities in a field of noughts

The origin of matter and life
The fractal nature of a mind in the mind
A drop in the ocean that makes the water shine
A pale simulacrum of a cosmic architect

The eye opened wide contains another eye
In this eye an eye and another eye again
Ideas moving to the center of the spiral
Creating space and time
Eternity and infinity
The birth of the universe
From nothingness

The origin of matter and life
The fractal nature of a mind in the mind
Decode the structure of the world by
Wandering the fractal design
The sequence transforms at every move

The eye opened wide contains another eye
In this eye an eye and another eye again
Ideas moving to the center of the spiral
Creating space and time
Eternity and infinity
Creation is something beyond
The limits of
Consciousness,
Will and representation
It's inevitability

[Part IV: Tree Of Life]

Flowing through the air
Like an ethereal presence
Suspended high above the water
Alone
With nothing but the wind
Whispering in my ears
No sounds, no signs
No one but me, here

I fly through the clouds and higher
Where there's just the sky
Nothing but sparkles and reflections
Come into sight
Down there's just the sea
A drop of water in the cosmic landscape
Where the seed of life will shortly sprout
Even if I don't know why, I know this

The drop is shining
And the sphere is cracking
As the seed falls in the abyss
At the speed of light

Wandering the void
Searching for some signs of life
Now I float on the surface of the water
Tired of flying, tired of everything
A dead world is what I'm in
I am alone and lost here

I'm floundering in the waves now
The weight of this cerulean sky
A heavy burden on my shoulders
Keeps me down
I struggle not to fall
In the abyss opening under me
Only my screams rip this vast silence
That permeates this world so sad and cruel

The abyss under me is shining
And the sphere is cracking
As the seed suddenly sprouts
And time flies at the speed of light
And the flower blossoms
And the fish swims
As life conquers the Earth
And the bird flies
While the Tree of Life puts down its roots in the Earth
[2x]

[Part V: Crossing The Line]

Clear sky, silent beach
Shining sun and pleasant heat
On my skin, on my face
The world is calm and peaceful
The sound of my footsteps on the soil
The sole sound flowing through the solid air
They should be singing now
Those afternoon birds
While the sun is going down
But where are they now?

The sand is pleasantly hot still
As the stars are lighting up in the sky
Now before my eyes
Or in my eyes I see
Light bulbs, lights, lights!

Strange flares at the end of the World
Lights! lights!
Lights come and go
To the horizon or in my mind
While static becomes dynamic

The gray turns to color
The image is focused now
Odd words, forms and correlations emerge
From the back of my mind
Overwhelming me like a tidal wave
Everything I see hides something else
Billions and billions of things
I see patterns now
Threads, semantic

Now I know what's happening
I'm crossing the Line

I've seen things, it has been like I was him
I've seen it all through his eyes
I've experienced the moment
Of crossing the Line
The dawn of consciousness
The sparkle of self-awareness
Inevitability
I've seen it all, now I know it all
It's all so clear now

The Universe originates from the mind
The Mind gathers energy
Energy crystallizes into matter
Amino acids, DNA, atoms, molecules
The Building blocks of life

Matter organizes itself to create
A cradle for the mind
A birthplace for
Consciousness
And when the mind is born

It creates thought
And thought creates the Universe

[Part VI: Albert II]

Mind over Matter
Consciousness over Mind
Mind over Consciousness
Matter over Mind
To Think is just to Create
To Create is just to Think
The Universe is a thought
Thought encapsulates the Universe
I'm in the Universe
I'm in a Thought
Butâ¦ whose Thought?..
Whose Thought?..
