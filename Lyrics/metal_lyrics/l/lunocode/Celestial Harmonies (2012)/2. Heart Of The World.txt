Iâm staring at the sunset in silence on this autumn evening
On the top of this hill sitting in the grass
Everything is whispering Infinity
Life on this Earth, the meaning of the pain
I have in my heart
Iâm searching for something sacred that
I left behind years ago

I breathe deeply the fresh air while I fall
And I lose myself in my soul

We will learn to march together
Under the rays of sunshine
We will learn to listen to each other
Without hate in our minds
We will find ourselves united
And we'll let the light surround us
In the heart of the World

A cold wind is blowing like a storm
I can feel it caressing my skin
It seems that the breathing of the Universe
Is violently shaking the Earth
Playing the game of Life we all lose
We raise our own walls and close ourselves in
Then picture each other as enemies
Wasting our time on Earth

I breathe deeply the fresh air while I fall
And I lose myself in my soul
Space and Time are flowing through my mind
And I can see mankind sing in Celestial Harmony

We will learn to march together
Under the rays of sunshine
We will learn to listen to each other
Without hate in our minds
We will find ourselves united
And we'll let the light surround us
In the heart of the World
