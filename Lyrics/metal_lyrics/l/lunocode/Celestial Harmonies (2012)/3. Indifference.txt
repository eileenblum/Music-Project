Mothers wrapped by the heavy drapes of pain 
Faded into the sun as mirages of a nightmare
Trailing along the streets of broken lives 
Sobbing for the despair that breaks their hearts

On this ground soaked in the blood of their children 
The foolâs scythe harvests the hearts of the innocents
And they slowly melt under a pitiless light 
While insane jackals fight over their prey

Wars between worlds on the same Earth 
Bullets hiss and bombs explode
Bullets hiss and bombs explode 
Wars between worlds on the same Earth 
Maiming our bodies and the face of the planet 

On this pale blue dot events memorable,
Criminals and heroes, fighting face to face,
Slaughter and destruction, cultures and beliefs
have given way to each other and coexisted in the same ages

A whirl of instants, people, feelings and relations
As photograms of a single movie passed and dissolved 
Their singularity got lost in the void
Diluted through the short history of our home 

Wars between worlds on the same Earth 
That ignore their resemblances 
That ignore their resemblances
Wars between worlds on the same Earth 
Caught in their subjective truth, in their sullen motivations

Weâre the slightest indistinguishable part
In the immense, silent cosmic darkness
Lost through the dust of time
Under the indifferent glance of the Universe 

Shouts are shattered on the centuriesâ silence 
that repeat again the same mistakes with blind perseverance 
Altars raised in honour of the god of madness
Behind which hide the most grim motivations and desires

Weâre the slightest indistinguishable part
In the immense, silent cosmic darkness
Lost through the dust of time
Under the indifferent glance of the Universe

Weâre adrift in a sea of stars
A grain of sand on the cosmic shore
Dust in the wind of time

We are obsessed by supremacy
by glory, money and power
We claim to be unique
Lost in the foolish conceit  of immortality

[Quote by Carl Sagan:]
Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. 
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another.
