Dull, massive, cold and warm at the same time
In the shadow ways of light
in the sun dark shapes 
Papers on the walls, varnish on the asphalt 
A veil of uselessness covers  everything

Look at me, donât you see me?
I can feel your presence flowing around me
Look at me, donât you see me?
I can feel your castles hiding me in their shadows 

The leaden air greedy for 
Thoughts emerging from their souls
Smiles at those who rush through your veins
Planets moving around
Their intersecting orbits
Clash into each other without a glance
They feel alive only when colliding

Rain, glare and fog blur my sight
Uproar colliding with my senses is rousing me
Those fools canât escape, they get stuck in your cables
So you imprison their souls in your chaotic dance

Look at them, donât you see their eyes?
They can feel your presence flowing all around
Listen to them, donât you hear their cries? 
They can feel your castles spreading their shadows

The leaden air greedy for
Thoughts emerging from their souls
Smiles at people who rush through your veins 
People flowing on crossing paths
dead men walking who feel alive just when they collide
