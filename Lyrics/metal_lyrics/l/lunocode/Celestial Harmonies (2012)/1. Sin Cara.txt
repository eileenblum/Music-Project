I look around and I can't recognize anything
A strange world appears
Ambition and greed rule the world
The ambition of the few suffocates us all
Pushing our faces into the mud

Is this the destiny of Humankind?
A world of obliterated personalities
Robots without a face
Cogs in the machinery
We live in a time of no respect for the other
Take my hand and let everyone make their choice

We're forced to live under constant pressure
In mutual indifference
Choked by our own lives
As time goes by
Ants, all alike, in single file
Busy in our anthill
As the same words and stereotypes
Hit us
And nobody cares

Is this the destiny of Humankind?
A world of obliterated personalities
Robots without a face
Cogs in the machinery
We live in a time of no respect for the other
Take my hand and let everyone make their choice

In this world full of beings all alike
You will not lose your sweetness and humanity
Your every smile brings with it
All the innocence of a child
And all the happiness of being alive
Take me away with you, we will live in our world of
Green and blue

[QUOTE from Philip K. Dick:]
You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go.
It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity.
