Sometimes you find yourself in ruin
Sitting alone in the rain
Listening to distant thunder
That flashes against the sky

And suddenly
You realize youâre only dust in this world
Some flesh and bones without much importance

Weâre only a piece of the Universe
Condemned to live a life that we canât understand
Linked together in space but divided in our hearts
So we can never find
Peace of mind, till we die

Weâre only made to disappear
In the dance of the universe
Atoms falling, breaking
Or reassembling
Creating life, dust 
And stone

And you are
Only a little gear 
In this game
Some flesh and bones
Without any importance

Weâre only a piece of the Universe
Condemned to live a life that we canât understand
Linked together in space but divided in our hearts
So we can never find
Peace of mind, till we die

Weâve lost the perspective on the World
We waste time increasing hatred
Weâre only stardust and emotions are our only strength
When will we realize that all is
A Universal Plan

Weâre only a piece of the Universe
Condemned to live a life that we canât understand
Linked together in space but divided in our hearts
So we can never find
Peace of Mind, till we die
