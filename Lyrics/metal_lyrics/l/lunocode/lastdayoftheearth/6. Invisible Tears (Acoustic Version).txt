A face looks at me with his smile
He reminds me just of our lives
He wants to tell me what heâs left here
Heâs again with me, he leads my life and fears

And it seems
Thereâs no peace for me
For every day I live and
Every scar received
But today I must try
To find the courage to let it all go

Distant voices, dimmed images
I should leave them all behind me
But Iâm forced in this memory again
And I realize
Iâve cried too much
Now I have only Invisible Tears
Rising in the sky, that carried you away
From me, far away

But it seems
Thereâs no peace for me
For every day I live and
Every scar received
But today I must try
To find the courage to let it all go

Distant voices, dimmed images
I should leave them all behind me
But Iâm forced in this memory again
And I realize
Iâve cried too much
Now I have only Invisible Tears
Rising in the sky, that carried you away
From me, far away
