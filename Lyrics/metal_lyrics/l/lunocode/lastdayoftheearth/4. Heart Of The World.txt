Iâm staring at the sunset in silence on this autumn evening
On the top of this hill sitting in the grass
Everything is whispering Infinity
The Life on this Earth, the meaning of the pain 
I have in my heart
Iâm searching for something sacred that
I left behind years ago

I breathe deep the fresh air while I fall
And I lose myself in my soul
Space and Time are flowing through my mind
And now I see Eternity, all in front of me

A cold wind is blowing like a storm
I can feel it caressing my skin
It seems that the breathing 
Of the Universe
Is violently shaking the Earth
Playing the game of life
We all lose
We raise our own walls
And close ourselves in
Then picture each other
As enemies
Wasting our time on Earth

Our blue pearl that shines
Lost in space
Itâs not just mankind whoâs crying in
Misery and pain
Lifeâs all around and screaming to be heard
Higher than Heaven and if you want
Youâll be able
To see your face in every soul

When we learn to march together
Under the rays of sunshine
When we learn to listen each other
Without hate in our minds
When we find ourselves united
And let the light surround us
In the Heart of The World

So everything is pain
Everything is suffering in vain
From the flower that withers without water
To the man that cries for the love
He has lost at the end of his life
