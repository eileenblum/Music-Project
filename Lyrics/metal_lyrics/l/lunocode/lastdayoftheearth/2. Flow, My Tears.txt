A dusty shelf, an old book
Found a photo in it
An image of a day of joy and sun
A man and a child sat on the rubble
I remember you but you remember me
Do you remember me?

I'm here, inside this room
With only you and the silence of this
Damn summer of pain

Silently I'm crying at the edge of the world
Trying to understand if you are still inside
This shell that seems all that remains of you
And I try, desperately, to tell you who I am
Who I am!

A nightmare! Where are you now?
Where is the man who helped me in so many ways?
You died before the time! You left me alone
With the sorrow of holding your hand knowing
That you are not you anymore

How can I cope with this?
I'm not prepared at all
And the silence is the only thing I can feel

And inside I'm screaming out loud in vain
While outside I'm cold like a piece of ice
Flow, flow, my tears, and wash away this pain
Memories, Images
Here inside my heart

Silently I'm crying at the edge of the world
Trying to understand if you are still inside
This shell that seems all that remains of you
And I try, desperately, to tell you who I am
Who I am!
