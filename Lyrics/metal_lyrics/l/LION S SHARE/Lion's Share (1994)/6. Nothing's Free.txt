Lost in the faces, part of the
street, half empty pockets
and draggin your feet
the man with the answers,gives
you a rise
half way to heaven you don't ask
the price

Now you have what it takes to be famous
you're wiser
you know the road that you're taking
a little more to get you started
halfway through the sea your parted
you're breathing-believing

Nothing's free, he's got
youthrough the veil of sadness
nothing's free, and put you on thr
road to madnes
no deal, opened up the big decision
nothing's free, and it has put you in a prison
can you pay the jailer

A wonderful servant yours to command
grows to be master your life in his hand
a beatiful lover,then the divorce
coming down faster,each landing gets worse
