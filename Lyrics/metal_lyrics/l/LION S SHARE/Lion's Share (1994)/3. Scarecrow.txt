I stand before you, the one you
Search for
Called out my name within your
Dream
Standing before you, i'm the
Saviour, i'm the key
You're locked inside and can't
Get out
I'm here to help you

There is nothing you can do
You're the victim, you're the fool
Caught in a nightmare
Nowhere you can run
But you will never be alone...

I am the scarecrow
In your field of dreams
I'm here to protect you

You've got to believe or else
You'll fall
Deeper within, inside yourself
Stand up and fight it
There's no time for second thoughts
And if you want to break free
I'm here to help you

There is something you can do
you're no victim, you're no fool
caught in a nightmare
time to make a turn
and you will never be alone...

I am the scarecrow
in your field of dreams
i'm here to protect you
just like a scarecrow
here inside your dream
and i will protect you
