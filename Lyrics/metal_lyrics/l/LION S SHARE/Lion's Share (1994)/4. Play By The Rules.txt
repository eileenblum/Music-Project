Reach for the sky, pray to god you
will not die
and there is no reason for you to cry
listen up, stay cool, don't take me
for a fool
'cuz if you don't you'll soon no why

I'm your darkest dream come true
i'll fulfill your destiny
if you won't play by my rules
i'll take your life if you stand
in my way

I move in the shadows like a
spider in it's web
looking for my prey, strike as the
time is right
in the streets at night,well
proected from the light
i take what i want and i steal
anything that i like

Reach for the sky, pray to god you
will not die
listen up stay cool, don't take me
for a fool
'cuz if you don't you'll soon no why
