I thought i knew you so well
I thought i knew you but you were a liar
Empty words without truth
Someone came along, believed
You, blew wind
In your sails, so there's no
Justice after all...
Can't you see you're wrong!

Sins of a father!
This time you can't get out of it
Sins of a father!

Feels like i'm under a spell
Feels like i'm under a spell and i'm falling
Shattered by the things that i've learned
It's time to stand up
Straight, realize, repent
All you've done and be forgiven
By your son
Can't you see you're wrong!
