Oh, hear my warning and listen up
open your eyes and begin to see
an evil spirit has risen
an angel of death that brings
misery

He's taking hold of us all
he's gonna make us fall

Sooner than you'll realize
who can you criticize
judgment day's closing in
have you confessed all your sins

In disguise playing he fool
but step by step he's taking control

Sooner than you'll realize
who can you criticize
judgment day's closin in
when did it all begin
sooner than you realize
who can you criticize
judgment day's closing in
have you confessed all your sins
