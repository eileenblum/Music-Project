The night was cold and damp,
a chill in the air
a vision from the past, or were
you really there
the shadows made me see
unclear, hake with fear
i was paralyzed, i felt hypnotized
by your stare

The ghostly sound of silence, not
a single breeze
your face appeared before me, it
made me freeze
my heart was beating doubletime
out of line
was it just a dream or could it
be i was loosing my mind

Someone out there
the window i saw through
could i believe it
the face i saw was you

There was a point in time when we
had been so close
now there is nothing left, what we
share is gone
please leave me alone

In my loneliness you're haunting me
i just can't take it, not anymore
i'm in deep distress, please set me free
i just can't take it, oh no more

As quickly as you appeared you
faded out
you left me trembling cold,
i wanted to shout
loved you once, i can't do it
again, i'm going insane
if i could turn back time maybe
you still could be mine
