Surrounded by silence, pictures
within my mind
standing on the line,standing on
the borderline
to insanity

I hear the sound of my heart
drowning all my thoughts and i

clouding my mind

Searching for answers,out of control

Lost in a time and place, can't
seem to comprehend
where can i find, where can i find
the answers
for the questions i have

I hear the sound of my heart
world is spinning around and
i feel so alone
i hear the sound of my heart
standing at the crossroads
don't you know i'm
