the darkness comes but slowly the night
is still too young midnight ain't that far
away summon everyone hooded men of evil
pay tribute to his name can you hear us,
are you with us and the devil is to blame

they're crying out in ecstasy
save our souls from tonight and into infinity

unholy rites! what will become of us
unholy rites! what have they done
unholy rites! you know there's no place
left to run

i'm trapped within a nightmare there's
nothing i can do darkness is surrounding
me help me to pull through save me from
the evil that's raging land and sea can
you hear me, are you with me lord i'm
striving to break free

they're crying out in ecstasy save our souls
from tonight and into infinity

unholy rites! what will become of us
unholy rites! what have they done
unholy rites! you know there's no place
left to run
