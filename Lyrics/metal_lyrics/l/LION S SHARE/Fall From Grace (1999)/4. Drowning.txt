icy water pulls me down, surrounding me
drifting with the gentle stream,
embracing me too weary to reach the surface

a soldier of fortune bearing arms
without belief he's been under fire and
has never felt no grief pride and glory
the innocent dying for pride and glory

i hear them beg for mercy the terrifying
screams i hear them echo in my mind, cryin'

i'm drowning slowly inside the dream
i choke on the water drowning slow and
i see the visions of slaughter

awake in a cold sweat haunted by the
things he saw the silhouettes dancing
on the bedroom paperwall hell and fire
the yesterday victims it's hell and fire

i hear them beg for mercy the terrifying
screams i hear them echo in my mind, cryin'

i'm drowning slowly inside the dream
i choke on the water drowning slow and
i see the visions of slaughter

the hero in shadows for the gold he
sells his soul to fight for the honor
every mercenary's goal pride and glory
the innocent dying for pride and glory
