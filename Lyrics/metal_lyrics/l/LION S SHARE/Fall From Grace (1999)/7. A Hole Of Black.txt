in the dark i see everything is so much
clearer when i go through the door and i step
into a world for man unknown you can't
hold me back cuz there is something new unseen before

i've found what i want, it's true! and i'm
never coming back there's nothing that
you can do! going through a hole of black

as far as i can see in the misty haze before
me a white and shiny light i can feel it
piercing through my armoured suite
don't you hold me back i'll see you
somewhere else, another world
