they call me insane i'm not to blame
falling apart into pieces if you'd open
your eyes you could see through the lies
bloodsucking leeches to you it's a game
bent down in shame calling me names
without reason if i'd open my eyes i could
see the disguise got nowhere to run

on the edge of sanity the final fight has
begun at the edge of sanity, i'm lost!

and now i'm insane bent out of frame
holding a gun to my brain if i pull it i'm
done just a mind-twisted son riding a
freighttrain i stand all alone king
without a throne ruler of mindless
confusion screaming into the void it's my
future destroyed got nowhere to run

on the edge of sanity the final fight has
begun at the edge of sanity, i'm lost!
on the edge of sanity i turn my face from
the sun at the edge of sanity, i'm lost!

they call me insane i'm not to blame
falling apart into pieces if i'd open
my eyes i could see the disguise got nowhere to run
