i guess i always knew my days were
numbered i guess i'm just a fool who
lingers on sometimes i hoped to lead
another not fade away like a sunset
dying out

through all these years never been
a doubt or a maybe there is nothing that
i regret now and i never will right `til the end

i never knew although i wondered i never
realized the day would come sometimes
my heart is filled with sorrow to fade
away like a sunset dying out

through all these years never been
a doubt or a maybe there is nothing that
i regret now and i never will right `til the end

i remember i remember all that was
surrender i remember i remember all that was surrender
