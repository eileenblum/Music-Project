[Chriss / Johansson]

File driver detects
Thoughts of the sinister son
His velvet tongue is black
Black as the lies
I accuse him of murder
By noon he will die

Surgical death; logical fear
Cult of denial

Marked souls now impaled
They only stab from behind
Virtual tribes proclaim
War to the world
Defending the inhuman
A pact from above

Surgical death; logical fear
Cult of denial

File driver detects
Thoughts of the sinister son
His velvet tongue is black
Black as the lies
I accuse him of murder
By noon he will die

Surgical death; logical fear
Cult of denial
