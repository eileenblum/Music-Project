[Chriss / Johansson]

Lost generations; detectors of technical steel
Surrounded by serpents imprisoned by spinning the wheel
Divided disciples; chaotic machines virtualized
Now resurrected; conducting the start of their rise

Clones of fate
Devastate
Clones of fate
Terminate

New incarnations; a plague that grows larger than life
Absurd and outrageous but sharp like the edge of a knife
Seeking the future; increasing the fear of man kind
Sons of temptation, constructors of enemy lines

Clones of fate
Devastate
Clones of fate
Terminate
