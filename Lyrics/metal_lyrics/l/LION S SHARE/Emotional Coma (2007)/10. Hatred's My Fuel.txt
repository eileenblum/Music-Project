[Chriss / Johansson]

I got a knife in my locker
I got a gun that is mine
I am a boy on a mission
I don't know why, but you'll die

Hatred's my fuel
Hiding in the shadows
Violence; my tool
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Cursed by the fools
Hiding in the shadows
I make the rules
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel

Why do you sigh after others?
Why would they cry over you?
Why do you hate my desire?
Why is my time running out?

Hatred's my fuel
Hiding in the shadows
Violence; my tool
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Cursed by the fools
Hiding in the shadows
I make the rules

Hatred's my fuel
Hiding in the shadows
Violence; my tool
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Cursed by the fools
Hiding in the shadows
I make the rules
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
