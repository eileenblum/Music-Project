[Axelsson / Chriss / Johansson]

Balance of insanity
Union behind bars
Reunited scenery
Now show us where you are
Revolution; mind intrusion
Antidote of war
Army's multiplicity
The prize of life will soar

It's all too late; atomic slave
It's all too late; toxication rave

Serpent in euphoria
Brainwashed, drained and gone
Hide behind polluted clouds
The chaos has begun
Mass confusion; no solution
Interstate disease
Failure of conformity
Scrub my bleeding knees

It's all too late; atomic slave
It's all too late; toxication rave

Pay the fee too your life
Welcome to ecstasy
Permission to try
Now pay the ticket to life
Goodbye to courtesy
We do or we die

Balance of insanity
Union behind bars
Reunited scenery
Now show us where you are
Mass Confusion; no solution
Antidote of war
Failure of conformity
The price of life will soar

It's all too late; atomic slave
It's all too late; toxication rave
