[Chriss / Johansson]

Here now, burning ambition
Scenes from the highway; reborn in a strange land
I am the ultimate killer, time is on my side

I drift 'cross America
I walk on bloodstained soil
Nightmares to arrive
Embrace your fear my love

Your eyes see no compassion
No one can tame what's unleashed here inside me
Road kill, now my redemption; death is salvation

I drift 'cross America
I walk on bloodstained soil
Nightmares to arrive
Erasing lives my sun

I drift 'cross America
I walk on bloodstained soil
Nightmares to arrive
Embrace your fear my love
