[Axelsson / Chriss / Johansson]

Act of arson, trapped inside
Deed of pyromania
Act of arson; skies ablaze
Naked bodies licked by the flames
Crematorium, time to die
Total mayhem, none survived
Feel the smell of human steaks
Bones and blackened skin and ash

Demoralized the world tonight like one with the dust
Struck by temptation to steal the light
The flaming dice will roll tonight; no chance to adjust
It's the inferno of one man's rite

Fire starter, incubates
Man of madness pervert faith
Fire starter, masturbate
With erection, celebrates
Institutions feed his mouth
Better off lobotomized
Save your money, stop to fake
Here's the verdict: exterminate

Demoralized the world tonight like one with the dust
Struck by temptation to steal the light
The flaming dice will roll tonight; no chance to adjust
It's the inferno of one man's rite

Demoralized the world tonight like one with the dust
Struck by temptation to steal the light
The flaming dice will roll tonight; no chance to adjust
It's the inferno of one man's rite
