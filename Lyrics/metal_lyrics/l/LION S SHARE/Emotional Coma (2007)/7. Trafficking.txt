[Axelsson / Chriss / Johansson]

Now as the rope's getting tighter
Now as the envy is here
Where are the drugs to determinate the fear?
Raped by the senses inside you
Taken by people who hate
Backyard of life or reflections of your state

High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking

Come to the circus infernal
Come to a market of hounds
Just place a bid, human cattle all around
Needles; injecting your body
Needles to stick through your flesh
Buyers of death; will you pass their final test?

High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking

High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
