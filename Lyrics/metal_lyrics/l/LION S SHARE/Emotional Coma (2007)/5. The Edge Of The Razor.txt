[Chriss / Johansson]

Steal the eye from the blind
In the last temptation of the sky
They have burned the bridges of forever
Now as I wonder why
Shadows of tomorrow pass me by
Will I ever walk among the strangers?

Someone whispered my name
Someone cried out in shame
Another sleepless night

Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride; escape the erasure
A travel in time

Take the fire from the flame
In the final raging of the rain
Look around; the pagan of desire

No one asked me my name
No one suffered my pain
The desert of my heart

Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride; escape the erasure
A travel in time

Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride; escape the erasure
A travel in time
Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride; escape the erasure
A travel in time
