[Chriss / Johansson]

A chaser of delight
A jewel of the night
Danger games of mine
Now tell me is it far
Memories; for me they are
Glaciers of my mind

Soultaker
Soultaker
Prepare to meet your maker
Soultaker
Life has turned to hell

I'm dying for your trust
Glory and lust
Rape me one more time
Enthroned by my desire
Selfish; a denial
The psychic sea dried up

Soultaker
Soultaker
Prepare to meet your maker
Soultaker
Life has turned to hell

A chaser of delight
A jewel of the night
Danger games of mine
Enthroned by my desire
Selfish; a denial
Psychic sea dried

Soultaker
Soultaker
Now I've met my maker
Soultaker
Life has turned
Soultaker
Soultaker
Prepare to meet your maker
Soultaker
Life has turned to hell
