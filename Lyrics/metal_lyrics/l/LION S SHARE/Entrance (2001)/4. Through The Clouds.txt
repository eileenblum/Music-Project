I never thought
that you would leave me
You'd always be by my side
You'd never walk away from me

But then one day I still remember
Just like it was yesterday
You told me now it's over

And through the clouds,
on a rainy day
I see your face
Always close yet so far away

And now my days,
are without meaning
I wake up with dreams of you
Just emptiness tomorrow brings,
just emptiness

And through the clouds
on a rainy day,
I see your face
Always close yet so far away
It's tearing me apart
And through the clouds,
on a rainy day
I call your name
Always close yet so far away

And as the days go by
I slowly break down and cry
