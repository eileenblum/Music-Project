Out of darkness, you appear
Speechless figure,
filling me with fear
Eyes are burning bright with hale
I try to run hut it's loo late

Is this my destiny?
I feel the fire burning,
inside of me
It's not just fantasy
The evil spell I'm under
I'm falling

Waiting for the morning to come
Please, can you release me
from the pain?
Waiting for the morning lo come
Tell me, how can I escape

Hide in shadows, always there
Slowly prowling,
fill me with despair
Strike with power, catch your prey
I try to run, can't get away
