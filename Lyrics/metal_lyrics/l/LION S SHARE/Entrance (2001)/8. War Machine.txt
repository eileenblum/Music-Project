I'm the master of sin
Can you hear me tailing within?
I'm the lord of your pain
All your calls for help are in vain

I'll set your world on fire
Nowhere for you to hide
I'm gonna make you bleed
'Cause I'm the war machine
I'll put it all to flames
Will never he the same
Beyond your wildest dreams
Cause I'm the war machine

I am terror and rage
All your efforts will be too late
I'm your nightmare come (rue
Can you hear me calling for you?
Sad winds of destruction
Here comes my revolution
Torment and devastation
The fruits of my creation
The darkness is falling
As my new world is dawning
No one can ever help you
My evil spell's upon you
