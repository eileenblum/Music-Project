Oh hear my call,
want some changes to come
But don't get me wrong
I don't regret the things I've done
So I push on,
don't know what I am looking for
Don't have the answers any more

On and on I go
Everything I try to change,
remains the same
Round and round and back again
Believe me, I need some changes

I can't believe,
this is how it should be
But I carry on,
'til I am falling to my knees
There's got to be some way,
out of this misery
Some way to go that I don't see
