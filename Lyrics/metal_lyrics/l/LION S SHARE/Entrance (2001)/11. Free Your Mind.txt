Don't let them run your life
Tell you how to think or feel
The choices that you're making
They should he your own
Don't forget yourself
Looking inside
I know that you will find it there
What ever you may need

Free your mind
Let your heart decide
That's the way
Spread the word today

So never compromise
You just do what's in your heart
And you don't need a reason
Trust in what you feel
It's inside of you
Searching within
I know you'll find the answer there
No matter what you need
