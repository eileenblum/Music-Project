See you there on the corner
Have nowhere to go
All your dreams like a fading flower
Fade away to die
Now all your visions have left you
All your hope is gone
But I know it's not over
If you just

Believe
Don't give up the fight
You don't need to hide
Believe
And if you open up your mind
you will receive
(You've got to find a way)
Don't give up the fight
You can make it right
Believe
Cause only that will set you free

Slipping in to the darkness
There is no way out
If all seems like a constant struggle
Just to stay alive
And though it seems like you've lost it
You will find a way
And I know it's not over
If you just

So open up your mind
If you just believe
