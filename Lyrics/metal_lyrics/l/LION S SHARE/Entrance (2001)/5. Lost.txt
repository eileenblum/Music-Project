All of my dreams, falling apart
Taking me back, back to the start
All of my visions
All my ambitions
Crumbled to dust,
where are they now?

Lost in this maze
Lost in this maze called life
Where do I go?
Nowhere a guiding light

Things I have done all seem in vain
Efforts I made turned in to pain
All of my reasons
All my convictions
Crumbled to dust,
where are they now?

Lost in this maze
Lost in this maze called life
Where do I go?
Nowhere a guiding light
Lost in this maze
Nowhere an end in sight
How will I know?
Which way will lead me right
