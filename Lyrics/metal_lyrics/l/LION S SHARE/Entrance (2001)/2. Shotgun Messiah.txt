You're out there
I know you're around
Evil's your guide,
heart of stone deep inside
Yes, I know you
You're hungry
You're wanting it all
Don't care at all,
'bout the people who fall
I have seen it

I know you don't need a reason
For all the things that you've done
I know you don't care at all
You will carry on

Shotgun Messiah
Spreading your disease
Shotgun Messiah
Won't get to me

You're laughing
That look in your eyes
Speaking your mind
Truth is nowhere to find
We don't need it

You're out there
I know you're around
Evil's your guide
Heart of stone deep inside
Yes, I know you
I'm out here
Don't want you around
Don't want to hear
'bout your visions of fear
Had enough now
