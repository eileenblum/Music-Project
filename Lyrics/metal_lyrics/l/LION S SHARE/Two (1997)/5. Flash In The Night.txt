As a break of dawn came closer
my hopes seemed so forlorn
the misty signs of laughter
and the light eluded all
my despair was caught in motion
a face just barely true
shadows in blue

A flash in the night

In the changing of the season
releasing one lost name
the scar once healed forever
dissolving in the rain
a twig snapped in the clearing
a glimpse of golden skin
my face within

A flash in the night

And my despair was caught in motion
a face just barely true
shadows in blue

A flash in the night
