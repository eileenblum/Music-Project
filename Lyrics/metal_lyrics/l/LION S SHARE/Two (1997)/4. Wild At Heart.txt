Sometimes my life whirls around
the knowledge
that somehow it seems I'm lost
inside a maze
when i was seven, i needed someone
someone who'd understand
then at eleven, nothing could stop me
i was already lost!

Evil and wild, he is
when you look into my eyes
devil's own child, watch out!
you know they don't tell no lies

You know i've got a meanstreak
and you know that nothing can
stop me now
wild at heart! nothing can stop me

And now it's too late, too late
to turn around
i have no hope to make it through alive
I'm not worth it, unholy messiah
i've played the game too well
now that i see it, unworthy of pity
i have to pay the cost

Evil and wild, he is
when you look into my eyes
devil's own child, watch out!
you know they don't tell no lies

You know i've got a meanstreak
and you know that nothing can
stop me now
wild at heart!
soon it's over
you know i've got a meanstreak
and you know that nothing can
stop me now
wild at heart! nothing can stop me
