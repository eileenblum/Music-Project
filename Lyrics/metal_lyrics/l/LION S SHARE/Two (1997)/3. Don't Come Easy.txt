You know my love don't come easy
i don't always see things clear
some days laughter some days crying
sometimes it feels all wrong

But i know we can't hide away
from our love
we still feel the same

You know we don't mean it
what's been said and what's been done
i know we still believe
though it sometimes seems so hard
it's more than a feeling
that we can't erase by far
you see it in my eyes girl
that my love for you is true

Looking back at all the memories
all the good times that we had
i know we'll have them in the future
if we only make amends

'cuz i know we can't hide away
from our love
we still feel the same

You know we don't mean it
what's been said and what's been done
i know we still believe
though it sometimes seems so hard
it's more than a feeling
that we can't erase by far
you see it in my eyes girl
that my love for you is true

Now we know our love is sacred
and together we'll be strong

You know we don't mean it
what's been said and what's been done
i know we still believe
though it sometimes seems so hard
it's more than a feeling
that we can't erase by far
you see it in my eyes girl
that my love for you is true

You know our love don't come easy
