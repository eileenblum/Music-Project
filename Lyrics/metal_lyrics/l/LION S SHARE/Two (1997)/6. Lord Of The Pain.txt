Feel my solid coat of steel
hear the thunder taste the fear

'cuz you can't
keep me from speaking
I'm the lord of the pain
i'll tell ya!

Hate consumes you, i can't wait
one round, that's all and he's gone

'cuz you can't
keep me from speaking
I'm the lord of the pain
i'll tell ya!
you don't
know all the answers
I'm the solution insane
i'll tell ya!

Pray you'll make it through the day
meet your fate on a darkened street
