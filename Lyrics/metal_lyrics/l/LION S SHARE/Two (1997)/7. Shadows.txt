I saw her standing by the shore
her eyes they looked so sad
never seen her like this way before

She felt a pain behind her eyes
burning inside
pictures flashing by, memories
on the rise

Could it be shadows from her past
she tries to understand, they're

Fading fast

The visions took her by surprise
she fell on her knees, terror
in disguise

Could it be shadows from her past
she tries to understand, they're
fading fast
could this be shadows from the past
she tries to understand but
they don't last

In the dark voices calling, calling
to her in her dream
and she feels like there is something
trying to break through

Strait-jacket keeps her
safe and sound
burning inside
her eyes are looking sad
the world is spinning round

Could it be shadows from her past
she tries to understand, they're
fading fast
could this be shadows from the past
she tries to understand but
they don't last
