In the heart of the lonely
lies a well of eternal faith
even though there are scars
upon his soul
walks the path with the knowledge
the spirit is by his side
stay awake! before the evil
takes control

Primer se volch demostar
ave nostra sanctus dominus

Pray! deliver me from evil
save my soul
father be proud of me
pray! the blood inside my
vains are running cold
heaven awaits for me

By the way of the pilgrim 
in the search of the holy land
driven on through the rain and
endless snow
pushing on 'cross the mountains
he knows still it's far to go
stay awake! the holy quest 
awaits below

Primer se volch demostar
ave nostra sanctus dominus

Pray! deliver me from evil
save my soul
father be proud of me
pray! the blood inside my
vains are running cold
heaven awaits for me

Now as i stand here on the edge
of the world, fall on my knees pray you
my soul will keep
my lord in heaven oh, hear my prayer!
save me from evil won't you please
guide my way

Lead me, guide me on my way to
promised land
where i rest my weary bones
timeless hours to the land where
you were born
where your spirit always roam

Go on! i hear the voice inside my head
be strong! i know just what the preacher said

Pray! deliver me from evil
save my soul
father be proud of me
pray! the blood inside my
vains are running cold
heaven awaits for me

Finally, i have made it to jerusalem
after all it has come true
a dream, one goal make it to the
promised land, and i owe it all to you

Primer se volch demostar
ave nostra sanctus dominus

Pray! I'm standing here
amazed on holy ground
father be proud of me 
pray! the paradise on earth
i know i've found
heaven is here for me 

And i'll pray
