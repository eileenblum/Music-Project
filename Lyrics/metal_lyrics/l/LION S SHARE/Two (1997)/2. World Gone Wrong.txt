Through, through these eyes i see
the world, we share it's destiny

Beware, beware the greedy hands
that rapes our mother earth
speak up and make a stand

Tomorrow you know it's to late
we have to face it
don't you know we can't wait

The world's gone wrong
the manipulation of us all
the lie goes on
we can make a difference
we can change the world and right now

I'm scared, so scared of what
they've done
I'm scared of what will come
i wish it all undone

The world's gone wrong
manipulation of us all
the lie goes on
we can make a difference
we can change the world
the world's gone wrong...
