I travel through time
in this computorized world
I'm lost

I'm floating, I'm gliding
I'm drifting, I'm flying
I'm going nowhere fast

Far! further than the stars
I'm moving through
spirals of time
far! further than all stars
moving through the shadow zone

Destination's unclear
going where noone has been explore

I'm floating, I'm gliding
I'm drifting, I'm flying
I'm going nowhere fast

Far! further than the stars
I'm moving through
spirals of time
far! further than all stars
moving through the
shadow zone

I'm hovering in space 
one million lightyears from home endless

I'm floating, I'm gliding
I'm drifting, I'm flying
I'm going nowhere fast

Far! further than the stars
I'm moving through
spirals of time
far! further than all stars
moving through the 
shadow zone
