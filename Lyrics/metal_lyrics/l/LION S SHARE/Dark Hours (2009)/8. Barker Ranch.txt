Lost and gone or buried as the family died
After decades of grief without executions
The moment is here
One more song or hatred, it is all I can give
While I dig in the dirt with high expectations
To bring back the peace

And I'm going back to Barker ranch
'Cause it has to be the end
Going back to Barker ranch
I will take you home

Forty years of sadness
And the wounds never healed
In the nights I can't sleep
It'll haunt me forever
Nightmares on repeat

And I'm going back to Barker ranch
'Cause it has to be the end
Going back to Barker ranch
I am justice
So, I'm going back to Barker ranch
'Cause it has to be the end
Going back to Barker ranch
I will take you home

And I'm going back to Barker ranch
'Cause it has to be the end
Going back to Barker ranch
I am justice
So, I'm going back to Barker ranch
'Cause it has to be the end
Going back to Barker ranch
I will take you back home
Take you back home
