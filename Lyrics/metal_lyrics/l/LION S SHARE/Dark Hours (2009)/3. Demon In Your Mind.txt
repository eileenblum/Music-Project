Steal the light, let darkness be forever
Heaven is the mercenary's alibi
Curse the light, tonight you'll be the reaper
Master of "Extermination Enterprise"

One more demon in your mind
Disciple and prisoner, warrior and slave
South of heaven you will rise
The voices are calling, they're calling again

Bleeding eyes will never see the sunlight
Family ties are broken by a stranger's hand
Screaming eyes as blood runs from their faces
Locked behind the fences of anxiety

One more demon in your mind
Disciple and prisoner, warrior and slave
South of heaven you will rise
The voices are calling, they're calling again

Cast away inside an institution
Victim of intrusion or another child?

One more demon in your mind
Disciple and prisoner, warrior and slave
South of heaven you will rise
The voices are calling, they're calling again
One more demon in your mind
Disciple and prisoner, warrior and slave
South of heaven you will rise
The voices are calling, they're calling again
