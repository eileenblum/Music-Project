There's a rumor in the air
'Bout the blood on the rocks
Heard the gospels in the sunlight
And they all came around

Another voice of a thousand dreams
A different kind and they all believed
Just like a heavenly sound
To break the blind man's law,  the revolution called
The time has come to face your sins

Judgment day, freedom shall rise, it will burn like fire
Judgment day, heavy cross to bear

Shall the prisoners arise?
From a world under lock
Will the chains remain unbroken?
At the scene of the crime

So many came and so many died
Reflections of disillusioned minds
Oh, but then the king came around

Been to the mountain top, I've seen the Promised Land
And I'm not fearing any man

Judgment day, freedom shall rise, it will burn like fire
Judgment day, heavy cross to bear
Judgment day, freedom shall rise, it will burn like fire
Judgment day, heavy cross to bear

Judgment day, freedom shall rise, it will burn like fire
Judgment day, heavy cross to bear
Judgment day, freedom shall rise, it will burn like fire
Judgment day, heavy cross to bear

Another voice of a thousand dreams
A different kind and they all believed
On the judgment day, judgment day
Heavy load
