I am insane, tried to shelter my brain
My intentions are bad
High on theory's of lies

Have they ever been here?
Have we ever been there to walk the surface
On the backside of the moon?
Have they ever been here?
Have we ever been there to shake the hand
Of the master of the moon?

We have ever been there

Spies afraid of the bomb
Tribes they're deaf and they're dumb
Fly, oh rocket, oh fly
Why can't be denied?

Have they ever been here?
Have we ever been there to walk the surface
On the backside of the moon?
Have they ever been here?
Have we ever been there to shake the hand
Of the master of the moon

I am insane, tried to shelter my brain
Fly, oh rocket, oh fly
Why can't be denied?

Have they ever been here?
Have we ever been there to walk the surface
On the backside of the moon?
Have they ever been here?
Have we ever been there to shake the hand
Of the master of the moon

Have we ever been there,
Have we ever been there
