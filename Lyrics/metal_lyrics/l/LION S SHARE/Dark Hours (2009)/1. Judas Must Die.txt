Waiting for darkness, no tunnel of light
Vanishing heartbeats, a vicious advice
Dying believer, attacked from behind
Rebel commander or just an image of the times

Caught in the jungle, some can still remember
Captured behind the enemy lines

Judas, Judas must die
Judas, it's written in the sky
Judas, Judas must die
Judas lived upon a lie

Seeking adventure, the thrill of the race
Found revolution, a violent purchase
Exterminator, the top of the line
Poet and dreamer or just a devil in disguise

Butchered by soldiers for the king and country
Are you a savior or a God?

Judas, Judas must die...

Waiting for darkness, no tunnel of light
Vanishing heartbeats, a vicious advice
Dying believer, attacked from behind
Rebel commander or just a devil in disguise

Caught in the jungle, some can still remember
Captured behind the enemy lines

Judas, Judas must die...
