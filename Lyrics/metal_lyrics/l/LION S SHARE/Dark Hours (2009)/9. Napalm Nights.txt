Master of the game, destroyers of the earth
Disrupted heart, it's lost and gone
The world is now ashamed, denying their rebirth
While your own child is still alive

Serpent's ways leave your madness
Who can deliver? The freedom is gone

Napalm nights, it came from the sky
Napalm nights, but why did they wake up?
Napalm nights, unpleasant surprise
Napalm nights, a funeral pyre

Bridges to be burned, no lessons to be learned
It's Hell on wings behind the clouds

Yellow rain, see the ashes
This execution is finally done

Napalm nights, it came from the sky
Napalm nights, but why did they wake up?
Napalm nights, unpleasant surprise
Napalm nights, a funeral pyre

A thrower of the flame, a nation to be tamed
The raging fire, you saw it all
Master of the game, destroyers of the earth
Disrupted heart, it's lost and gone

Serpent's ways leave your madness
Who can deliver? The freedom is gone

Napalm nights, it came from the sky
Napalm nights, but why did they wake up?
Napalm nights, unpleasant surprise
Napalm nights, a funeral pyre

We burned alive, in napalm nights
