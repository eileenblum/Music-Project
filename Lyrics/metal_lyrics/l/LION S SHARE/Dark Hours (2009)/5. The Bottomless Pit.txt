Knives, I hold my knife so tender
I am the great pretender
They say that I'm insane
Knives, I do control the dagger
There's no one who can help me
The dagger shows my way

I'm not alive
Welcome to forever

In the bottomless pit
The bottomless pit
In the bottomless pit
The cradle of madness
The bottomless pit

Chains, I really love my chainsaw
It's like a chain reaction
Come on and do the dance
Chains, you're welcome to my cellar
It is the lair of heathens
No need to start to pray

So stick around
Fortress of illusions

In the bottomless pit
The bottomless pit
In the bottomless pit
The cradle of madness
The bottomless pit

You are my child
I'm not alive
Welcome to forever

The bottomless pit
In the bottomless pit
The cradle of madness
The bottomless pit
The bottomless pit
In the bottomless pit
The cradle of madness
The bottomless pit
