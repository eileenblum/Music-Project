I believe I'm alive
I'm the river, I'm the child
Like a coward at the frontline
To be gone

They were right, they were wrong
Singing "We shall overcome"
Blood is running in the jailhouse
On and on

Sons were dying, mother's crying
Crime or suicide?
Twenty seven souls from heaven
Pride was in their eyes
Presidio cries

Father, send me a prayer
I'll be strapped into the chair
We are traitors of the nation
They declared

On the squares in the yards
Words are stronger than the gun
And this muting based on justice
To be won

Sons were dying, mother's crying
Crime or suicide?
Twenty seven souls from heaven
Pride was in their eyes
Presidio cries

Sons were dying, mother's crying
Crime or suicide?
Twenty seven souls from heaven
Pride was in their eyes
Presidio cries
Sons were dying, mother's crying
Crime or suicide?
Twenty seven souls from heaven
Pride was in their eyes
Presidio cries
