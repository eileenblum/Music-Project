I am the mind intruder
I am the primal fear
Rise up above religion
Racial war is here

Welcome to Helter Skelter
Face the apocalypse
This is the final shelter
I'll rule the world up there

Let the fire burn, in the shadows we will hide
Let the fire burn, the phantom rider cries

Servants of Armageddon
Soldiers of sanity
Wake up to termination
Who's your enemy?

Who is the tribal traitor?
Where are my wives of blood?
Don't cry, it's an illusion
The writings on the wall

Let the fire burn, in the shadows we will hide
Let the fire burn, the phantom rider cries
Let the fire burn, in the shadows we will hide
Let the fire burn, the phantom rider cries

Let the fire burn, in the shadows we will hide
Let the fire burn, the phantom rider cries
Let the fire burn, in the shadows we will hide
Let the fire burn, the phantom rider cries
