Everglowing sparks of augury
The celestial walls of gold
Just a windkissed illusion
Aeons die behind my countenance
Withering they are, just like windkissed llusions
Moulder away, I'm feeling weak
Breathe the spheres of eversleep
Stigmatized under an ancient seal of blood
Unforgiven steps
Towards an astral dawn of war
Mirror to the unspoken words of yore
In woe to crave for evermore...
War-scrolls of the apocalypse
Face the bitterness
Fallen windkissed illusions
Carthatic depth unfolds in utter emptiness
When whirling stars have bestowed their shapelessness
A crown, todbringender Seelenschein
A throne, unberuehrter Seelenstein
Frozen opaline eye...
Crush the seal of blood
Unlock the chamber doors...
Just let me cease in the cosmic cold
Child of the apocalypse
I am the witness, I am tragedy
I am the spectral void in the astral dawn
Child of the apocalypse...
