Run away 
But you can't fucking get away 
Goblin arrows from the high ground 
And they're killing you 
Not even level two 

Seven years 
At training academy 
Can't find the fight 
Are you kidding me? 

My horse is tired 
My ass is bruised 
Woke too late 
Born to lose 

[Pterodactyl scream] 

(Run away) 
Can't get far 
What's a D6 
(Run away) 
I don't have dice
