Born under a bad sign 
A crescent moon 
The masked magician (and he's serpent kissing) 
An eye of newt 

Summoning 
Whatever the fuck 
Low level spells (from the nine foul hells) 
I bought for a buck 

I can't come up with 
Any more of this stuff 
It gets real hard 
It gets real tough 

Part man 
Part machine 
Keeping the streets safe 
Keeping them clean 

Titanium alloy 
Around a human heart 
Killed by an asshole 
And his counterparts 

Where is my house? 
Where is my wife? 
I want it to end 
Not my marriage, my life 

Six million dollars is fine 
For a gun at the base of his spine 
What do you mean it makes more sense 
To put a fucking gun in the side of his thigh?
