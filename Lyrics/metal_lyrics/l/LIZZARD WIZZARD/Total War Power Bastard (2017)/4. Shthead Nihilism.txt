Real eyes 
Realize 
Can't socialize 

A mind unleashed 
A shithead masterpiece 

Am I being detained 

A sea of piss 
We'll drown in it 
Minds controlled by 
The government 
Sees your glans 
Through airport scans 
It's reptile hands 
That pull the strings 
That kiss your offspring 
Queens and kings 
Under the Pentagon 
Sipping their dom 
Perignon 
And fancy cheeses 
You're on your kneeses 
Praying to Jesus 
How can you allow 
This cold-blooded shit show? 
God is a shadow
