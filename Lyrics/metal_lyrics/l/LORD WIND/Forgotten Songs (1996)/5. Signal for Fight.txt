Black druid
Raise your hammmer way up high
Let it's shadow and sing
Summon spirits of destiny
My skin as wolf's undercoat
My falchion as levin
My shiled as enthralled diamond
My hair like ravens wings
Black druid
Beat drumms
War signal
Spirits of our ancestor
Are coming back
My eyes like nocturnal vision of an owl
My hands are hands of bear
My horse faster than wind breath
My heart colder than winter
Son of the wind
Dont look at me
But aim true
King of the night will carry your arrow
To aim when raises
When horns blows shrilly among the dank night
