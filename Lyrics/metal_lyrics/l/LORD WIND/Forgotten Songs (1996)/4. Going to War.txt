It's time for me to go for war
To take shield at my side and sword in hands
My head with helmet protect
Put on leather shoes
And a stronge horse mount
When moon rises
I will start my journey
Night will be my godness of darkness protection
Wind gently will drown my breath
Spirit will show the path
I will protect myself by shield
I will infict blows by falchion
Helmet will counter enemies arrows
Leather shoes in blood we will soak
Trampling our foes weith my horse
When moon rises
Deep in darkness I will hasten
Mist will offer to me, her hoary, helping hand
Trees will expose secret loads
