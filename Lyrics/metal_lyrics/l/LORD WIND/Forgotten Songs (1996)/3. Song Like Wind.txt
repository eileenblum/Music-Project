I will sign my song
Blessed and holy song
Song like wind
Like trees, like stream and stone
Like moon in fullmoon
Like eternal Menhir
Like severe white winter
Song brought by Gods
Changed in wind at morning
At the beginning of the world
I summon you... cruel wolves
Go down a hills in mist
Come here and join me
I will lead you into the world
Of magic and sorcery of my song
When night enters, sailing on one eyed moon
We will prepare our supper
One will remember forever about it
This grim white winter
And we will march to begin another battle
With raven wheeling above
In glade anong trees
Here, surronded by cobwebs of withered snow
Shedding redish blood on snow ice bed
