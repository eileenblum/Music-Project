A long, long time ago
Before christians came
And brought hunger and illness
And before they murdered us
A long, long time ago among brushhwood
I had lived, loved, hunted and fighted
People had been different
Gods had come down the earth
And had tought us fight
They had waged battles... they had led us
Fas away from falsehood
Today only winds sways trees
My world doesnt exist
I have become a spirit
Swayed by sad wind
I will tell you about theses days
I owe it to my brothers and sisters
I owe it to spirits and Gods
So listen to me
Altrough only wind proceeds
From my mouths...
