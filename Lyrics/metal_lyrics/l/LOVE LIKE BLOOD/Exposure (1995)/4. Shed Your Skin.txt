there is no time for feelings in your world
this is not the time of harmony at all
but there are crimes of violation 
I can see the signs of satiation 

turn around, around your eyes 
take a look, a look inside 
turn around, around your head 
take a look, a look inside 

come on, shed your skin 
come on, shed your second skin tonight 

you are not alone, open your mind 
try to find the roots of your heart 
come on and take this chance tonight 
ans show me your inside 

and all the fears, fears fall down 
like the trees of autumn 
let their leaves, leaves fall down 
like the trees in autumn 

come on, shed your skin
come on, shed your second skin tonight 

fear is like a haze 
blocking everything 
real love, luck, joy of life 
it weakens your essence 

when the fear is so near 
let it fall down 
let the tears in your fears 
let them fall down 

come on, shed your skin 
come on, shed your second skin, tonight
