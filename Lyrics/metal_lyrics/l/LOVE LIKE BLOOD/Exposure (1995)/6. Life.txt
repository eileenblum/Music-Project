so, this was your life ? let's think about it, 
let's take a look back, before you die ! 
what do you think ? too less, too much ? 
was it all right ? was it enough? 

too lucky, too depressed ? too quiet, too much stress?

too rich, or too poor ? too safe , too unsure ? 
too warm or cold ? too young or too old ? 

or was it just all right ??? 

have you loved enough, 
have you hated enough ? 
have you worked enough, 
have you disturbed enough ? 
have you learned enough, 
have you created enough ? 
have you cried enough, 
have you laughed enough ? 

no you haven't lived enough ! 
you have not lived enough ! 
life ! back to your life ! 
life ! back to the other side ! 

do you think it's enough for the end of your life ? 
do you think it's this is the right time to die ? 
that this is right the moment for a suicide ? 
no, I won't let you go, you won't say good bye ! 

no, you haven't seen enough ! 
you have not changed enough ! 
life ! back to your life ! 
life ! back to the other side ! 

there's too much to do for you in this world 
so come on let's take this second chance 
come one let's take this second chance 
to start everything new again 
and I will let you know, when the time is right 
yeah I will let you know, when the time is right 

life ! back to your life ! 
life ! back to the other side ! 
back to your life ! 
back to the other side ! 
back and change your life 
back and change your mind 
back and change it 
back and change it all !
