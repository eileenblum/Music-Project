some things will never leave you alone 
they follow you through your whole life 
they will come back when you wake up 
and then you know thats the way it is 
they will show you that they still exist 
all your memories, all the good and bad 
they all shimmer inside your head 

I don`t understand this world anymore 
I don`t understand this world anymore 

the rain in my brain is corrosive 
I?m lost in what I found 
I?m loosing the ground under my feet 
so sweet is the stuff 
which disturbs the inside of my head 
kills all memories that I ever had 
when I come down again, 
everything is still the same 

I don`t understand this world anymore 
I don`t understand myself anymore 

lost my direction, broke all connections 
I don`t understand this world anymore 
I don`t understand myself anymore
