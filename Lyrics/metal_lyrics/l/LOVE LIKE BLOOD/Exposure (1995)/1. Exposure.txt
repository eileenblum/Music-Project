I want to see you exposed 
I want to hear the real truth 

lay your head into my hands 
let me know the real truth 
let your soul just talk to me 
what you really want to be 
let's relive the day of birth 
with all the original pain 

pain, pain, 
deep inside of your soul, 
deep inside of your soul 

let me help to find yourself 
try to find who you really are 
you think you need a big elbowroom 
on your trip you're the superstar 

feels like a hole deep inside of you 
feels like a hole deep inside of you 
pain, pain 

you are hungry, but you don't know why 
you are searching, but you don't know what 
like you've lost something - don't know what it was 
pain 
deep inside of your soul, 
deep inside of your soul 
feels like a hole deep inside of you 
feels like a hole deep inside of you
