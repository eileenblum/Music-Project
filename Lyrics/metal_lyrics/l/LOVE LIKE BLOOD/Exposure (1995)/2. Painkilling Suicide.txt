every day was a fight against your own suicide 
parasites and mites suckled from the inside 
they always came completely mixed up 
always called your name, blood-suckling creatures: 

we can give you something, 
something you always searched for 
we can show you something 
you never had before

arising sensations for your flesh and blood 
but all these fallacies at the abyss of madness 
makes you see that you could also get brainless 
it's your decision about life and death 

promising something 
like power and strength 
promising something 

creatures, creatures of madness 
dancing in your mind 
creatures, creatures of madness 
dancing in your mind, 
dancing in your mind 

I can give you something, 
something you always searched for 
I can show you something, 
you never've seen before 
making a promise, 
you never heard before 
you can get something, 
you always waited for 

creatures, creatures of madness 
dancing in your mind 
creatures, creatures of madness 
dancing in your mind 
urging you to a painkilling suicide 
urging you to a painkilling suicide 
painkilling suicide
