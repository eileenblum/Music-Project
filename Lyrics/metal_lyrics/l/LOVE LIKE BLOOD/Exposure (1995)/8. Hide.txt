don't run away if you're in danger 
we will come to help you, 
cause this is no world for runaways 
cause this is no world for runaways. 

when a friend betrays you 
in the name of policy 
if the judge condemns to death 
in the name of religion 
sometimes people are so sick 
that you give them something to vomit 

you have to hide your smile 
you have to hide your god 
you have to hide your pleasure 
you have to hide your love 

if someone has disappeared 
justified by inconvenience 
when dictatorships start a war 
in the name of holiness 

you have to hide your smile 
you have to hide your god 
you have to hide your pleasure 
you have to hide your love 
your love
