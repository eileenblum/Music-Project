one man - high on a nuclear power station 
voluntary - exposed the lethal radiation 
somebody wants to die warning the whole nation 
somebody wants to cry a warning for the nation 

we need another termination 
we need another termination 

another day another place, another man is burning 
poured himself with petrol for us as a warning 
he is a crying flame on a dump in the morning 
but nobody will ever change the situation 
but his suicide will leave no natural yearning 
(for nature) 

we need another termination 
we need another termination 

it's 1995 and we still got no solutions 
while the nuclear waste still grows 
and with it the pollution 
is it the government or just 
a strange kind of confusion 
that we are still not able 
to get it in conclusion 
somebody tries to call 
a warning for the nations 
somebody sprayed the wall 
warning the whole nations: 

we need another termination 
we need another termination
