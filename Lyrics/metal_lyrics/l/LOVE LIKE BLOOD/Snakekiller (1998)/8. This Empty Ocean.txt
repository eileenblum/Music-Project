THIS EMPTY OCEAN HAS STOPPED TO MOVE 
THIS EMPTY OCEAN IS DRYING UP 
YOU CAN TEAR IT ALL APART, YOU CAN WRAP IT ALL AWAY 
SOMETHING WILL ALWAYS LAST, A REMEMBRANCE WILL STAY 
WHICH WILL ALWAYS TOUCH ME, WILL TOUCH ME MY HOLE LIFE 

THIS EMPTY OCEAN HAS STOPPED TO MOVE 
THIS EMPTY OCEAN IS DRYING UP 
HAS LOST HIS CONTENTS 
HAS LOST THE IMPORTANCE 
IS GONNA BE A DESERT SOON 

LOVE CAN BE LIKE A DRUG, SWEET AND DANGEROUS 
EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW FAST THE TIDE CAN TURN 
WHERE ELSE IS PLEASURE AND PAIN SO CLOSE TOGETHER 
EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH THAT WOUNDS CAN BURN 
WHEN THRILL AND DEPRESSION FOLLOWS CLOSELY IN SUCCESSION 

THIS EMPTY OCEAN HAS STOPPED TO MOVE 
THIS EMPTY OCEAN IS DRYING UP 
HAS LOST HIS CONTENTS 
HAS LOST THE IMPORTANCE 
IS GONNA BE A DESERT SOON
