I LAY MY HAND ON YOU AND DRIVE WITH YOU INTO THE DAWN 
WE LEAVE THE NIGHT BEHIND US AND ALL THE CHAINS WHICH HELD US 
I LAY MY HAND ON YOU, SILENTLY WE WATCH THE RISING SUN 
ALL OUR THOUGHTS MELT TOGETHER, I WISH THIS RIDE WOULD LAST FOREVER WOULD LAST FOREVER 
DAWNLAND, DAWNLAND I HAVE SEEN YOU 
DAWNLAND, DAWNLAND I HAVE BEEN THERE 
WE LET PASS BY ALL OUR YESTERDAYS, AND WE FLY UP INTO THE BLISS 
WE DIVE DOWN INTO THE DAWN, THERE'S NOTHING WE'D DEMAND OR MISS THERE'S NOTHING WE MISS 
DAWNLAND, DAWNLAND I HAVE SEEN YOU 
DAWNLAND, DAWNLAND I HAVE BEEN THERE 
I TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND WE DIVE DOWN, DOWN INTO 
THE DEEP WIDE SPACE OF DAWNLAND AND WE FALL ASLEEP SKIN AT SKIN SKIN AT SKIN DAWNLAND, DAWNLAND I HAVE SEEN YOU 
DAWNLAND, DAWNLAND I HAVE BEEN THERE 
DAWNLAND DAWNLAND .
