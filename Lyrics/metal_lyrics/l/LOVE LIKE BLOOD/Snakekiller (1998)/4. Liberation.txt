LET 'S GO TOGETHER THROUGH THIS GATE 
STRAIGHT TO THE HEAVEN OF THOUGHTS JUST FOR A VERY SHORT STATE 
A FAST FUSION OF DIFFERENT SOULS JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE 
WHEN I WILL CLOSE MY EYES I WILL BE FAR AWAY 
WHEN MY HEART CEASES TO BEAT YOU KNOW THAT I STAY 
I WANNA FEEL, I WANNA FEEL, I WANNA FEEL 
LIBERATION OF SOULS, LIBERATION OF SOULS 
I CAN PICTURE THE WINGS ON MY SOUL HOW I FLY AWAY 
I CAN FEEL EMOTIONS, SO EXTREME MORE THAN I CAN SAY 
I WISHED THIS MOMENT?D NEVER END THAT I CAN STAY HERE LIKE FOREVER 
I HOPE THAT'S MY SECOND LIFE AND THAT THIS LIFE WOULD NEVER END I WANNA FEEL, I WANNA FEEL, I WANNA FEEL 
LIBERATION OF SOULS, LIBERATION OF SOULS 
I CAN PICTURE THE WINGS ON MY SOUL HOW I FLY AWAY 
I CAN FEEL EMOTIONS, SO EXTREME MORE THAN I CAN SAY 
I WANNA FEEL, I WANNA FEEL, I WANNA FEEL 
LIBERATION OF SOULS, LIBERATION OF SOULS 
LIKE MELTING STARS IN THE SKY AT NIGHT 
EXPLOSIONS AT NIGHT OF MELTING STARS 
IN THE DEEP BLACK - BLUE SKY 
SO MUCH COLOURS, SO MUCH ENERGY SET FREE! 
I WANNA FEEL MY SOUL SO FREE ! 
FREEING, FREEING, FREE YEAH ! .
