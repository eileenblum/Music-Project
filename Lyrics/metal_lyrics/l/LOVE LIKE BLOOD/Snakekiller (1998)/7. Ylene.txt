I PULL YOUR RING FROM MY FINGER I WILL CHANGE THE LOCKS ON MY DOOR 
PLEASE STOP CALLING I WILL CHANGE MY NUMBER 
I'M ANSWERING YOUR CALLS NO MORE 
ONCE YOU WERE IN MY DREAMS, ONCE YOU WERE IN MY DREAMS 
I SAW YOU STUMBLE ACROSS THE CORNER 
PALE BLUE EYES WITH A DIFFERENT LOOK 
YOUR GOLDEN HAIR TURNED TO GREY 
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO FIND THE WORDS TO SAY 
THAT YOU DON?T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIVING FOR 
AND YOU DON?T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT NO MORE 
YOUR EYES JUST STARRED WITHOUT A MEANING 
NOW THE NEEDLE'S DONE THERE IS DIFFERENT DEMON 

YLENE, ONCE YOU WERE IN MY DREAMS 
YLENE, THIS IS A DIFFERENT SCENE 
YLENE, DON?T WANNA HEAR YOU SCREAM 
YOU PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON ON YOUR DREAM MACHINE 

YOU MADE LOVE TO MANY STRANGERS 
TOO MANY TIMES YOU'VE BEEN AWAY 

YLENE, ONCE YOU WERE IN MY DREAMS 
YLENE, THIS IS A DIFFERENT SCENE 
YLENE, DON?T WANNA HEAR YOU SCREAM 
YOU PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON ON YOUR DREAM MACHINE
