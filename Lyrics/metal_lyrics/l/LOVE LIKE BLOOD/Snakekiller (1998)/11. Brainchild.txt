BRAINCHILD 

RIDING THROUGH THE ENDLESS DESERT, WHITE GLARING AND FLAT EXCEPT 
THE HAZY POOR GLEAM OF MOUNTAINS AND THE DEVILSGRASS WITHIN 
SWEET DREAMS AND THE DEVILSGRASS WITHIN... 

BUT TOMORROW IT COULD BE TO LATE 
YEAH TOMORROW MAYBE MY TRUST COULD FADE 
TOMORROW I COULD SEE THINGS THROUGH A KIND OF GREYNESS 
AND THEN I COULD CHANGE MYSELF INTO A KIND OF BIRD OF PREY 

SWEET DREAMS DEATH AND NIGHTMARES 
ON THE NARROW PATH BETWEEN CRUSTS OF SALT 
THROUGH THE ENDLESS CRYING MONOTONOUS WILDERNESS 
GIVE ME YOUR WINGS BIRD I WILL SPREAD THEM OUT AND FLY 
TO THE WAY TO THE TOWER, WHERE I WILL SING ALL THEIR NAMES 
I WILL SING ALL THEIR NAMES 

BUT TOMORROW IT COULD BE TO LATE 
YEAH TOMORROW MAYBE MY TRUST COULD FADE 
TOMORROW I COULD SEE THINGS THROUGH A KIND OF GREYNESS 
AND THEN I COULD CHANGE MYSELF INTO A KIND OF BIRD OF PREY 

BUT TOMORROW IT COULD BE TO LATE 
YEAH TOMORROW MAYBE MY TRUST COULD FADE 
TOMORROW I COULD SEE THINGS THROUGH A KIND OF GREYNESS 
AND THEN I COULD CHANGE MYSELF INTO A KIND OF BIRD OF PREY
