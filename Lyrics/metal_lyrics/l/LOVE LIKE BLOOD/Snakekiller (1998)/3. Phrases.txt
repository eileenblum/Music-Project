A full bloom's glow melts the winter's freeze
I don't know if I should start with a breeze
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
I am too frightened and the distance shouts...
First it was one blood and now so far away
No wonder cause you were so easy to sway
The black swallow tries to fly in his cage
Shall I shoot myself to close this suffering
Shall I shoot myself to close this rage?

Retrace, reveal

Retrace your steps
Reveal the mystery
Reveal this phrases

But it doesn't stop to bleed

There is spit on the mirror every new-born day
In which two words are written: sex and suicide
These are the demons, the drugs bitter taste
And now you know the truth, now you can see the lies

Retrace, reveal

Retrace your steps
Reveal the mystery
Reveal this phrases

In this cage I don't want to die
And I don't wanna live in a cage like this
In this cage I don't want to die
And I don't wanna live in a cage like this

But it doesn't stop to bleed
But it doesn't stop to bleed .
