SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY 

AT DEAD OF NIGHT 
NOISELESS A COMET FALLS 
AS ANGELS HOLDING BACK THE STORM 
FROM SOUTH, NORTH, WEST AND EAST 
IT WAS A ABSOLUTE DEATHLY SILENCE 
NO BREATH OF WIND 
THERE WAS NO RUSTLING LEAF IN THE TREES 
THE OCEAN SMOOTH AS GLASS 
LIKE THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM 
NOISELESS THE COMET FALLS 
THE COMET FALLS 

SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY 

AND SOME ARE TURNING BACK 
NOISELESS A COMET FALLS 
NEVER A COMPROMISE 
NEVER STAY BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE 
FOR ONE OF THE SIDES 
WHEN WE MARK THE BODIES 
WHEN WE MARK THE LINES 

SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY 

NOISELESS THE COMET FALLS 
NOISELESS THE COMET FALLS 
NOISELESS THE COMET FALLS 
THE COMET FALLS 
THE COMET FALLS 
THE COMET FALLS 

SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE WORLDS 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE PALE SKY
