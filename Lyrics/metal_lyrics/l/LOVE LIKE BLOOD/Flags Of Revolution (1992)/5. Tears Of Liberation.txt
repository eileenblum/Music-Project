the way i'm walking
so dark so still
save me from the grave
hold out for cover
heven could be so fine
if the moon was rising high
but see the oceans mirrors
and see the dark sky
years of pain and hurt
everything I want
tears of liberation
years gone in a moment
I see your lifeless face
I see your eyes in tears
forever you've been hurt
you couldn't leave this place
corroded all the love
every pleasure is rejected
say what a feeling
every gladness such hatred
no more mossion on live
no joy of live for you
so you feel weak now
deep in body and ghost
blood an roses
I felt felt so sad
everything I wanted
only tears
