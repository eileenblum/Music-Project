I opened wide the door
and ran inside the pub so loudly
and the landlord said"oh hi ya bum,
do you wanna something to drink"
I answered"beer and sweties
give me one or give me three"
it seems so strange the only
one talking here is me and I faced...

apathy and boredom
what's wrong folks what's the point
whom do you bastards look at
is it a crime to act human
kind of living kind of living
am I alien am I strange
or am I looking like a craphead
but my words fall into a see
of bloody haughtiness so deep
and I face...

as I drink my beer and cold
cold eyes look straight into me
I have no wish to provoke
I don't like to disturb their apathy
I sit down and close my eyes
and listen to this silent music
and my mind is closing down and I fade
and I fade into...

apathy and boredom
