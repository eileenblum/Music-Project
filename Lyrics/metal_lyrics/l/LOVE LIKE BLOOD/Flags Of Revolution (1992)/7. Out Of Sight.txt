another day comes to another end
another kiss seals another hand
another hand is setting free
hidden tears I cannot see
while the moon is grinning a time
lifting up my agony
suffice it to say
i'll damn the whole day
whole day
heaven knows where heaven is
heaven knows just what I miss
keep the silence in embrace
I can't forget this happy face
where are the
frames of the happy days
out of sight
the soughts of lust of love
out of mind

the strength and the self respect
I could find
a head and a heart and a soul
it's really out of sight
who's walking in this park
who's singing in this dark
what am I supposed to do
why am I searching for you
moonlight please beware
the reality of despair
open your mind set it free
immortal agony
