written on the moon I see your reply
written on the sky, reflected in your eyes
behave yourself - this is my cry
the will to live - the reason why
you call it absolutely
necessary mercy killing

all the nights there made you crazy
all the time you wanted to flee
there was always danger in your dreams
and all that thoughts you fight to hide
about the motionless body at your side
with the hate that's growing in you
what an easy killing for you

don't do it, you ask me why
behave yourself, the evil in your eye
behave yourself, your greeds'll come alive
the will to live, the reason why

your emotions got to be colder
the person beside you got to be older
your emotions got to be colder
your gread got to be bolder and bolder
death, I can read it in your eyes
death, death now will come alive
helpless the body in swoon
your mercy act has to come soon
but suddenly as you pushed the tubes
you heard him cry for mercy
