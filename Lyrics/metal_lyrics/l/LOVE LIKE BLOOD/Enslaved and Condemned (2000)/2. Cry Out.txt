Tear me - And leave me dying
I feel your anger burn
I take revenge for crying
I know the tide will turn

Hate me - But you're a nothing
I know you doubt and frown
I see your dommsday coming
I prey your fate comes down

[pre-chorus]
Going down, coming down, going down

[chorus (x2)]
Cry out a brag in every word
Cry out your brag will be unheard
Cry out your word will be absurd
Cry out now

Watch me - will you remember you were a love of mine
You know your kind is dying you are the last devine
Hear me - and hear my warning you wear a thorny crown
You feel an age declining you see your fate come down

[repeat pre-chorus / chorus / solo / chorus]
