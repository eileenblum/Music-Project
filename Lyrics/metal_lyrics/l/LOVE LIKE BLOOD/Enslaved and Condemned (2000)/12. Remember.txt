Rise your eyes, the time has come
Rise your eyes, there's a yearning
There's a burning in the skies, walking

Walking helpless in undiscovered land,
from tomorrow to today and yesterday

[chorus]
Now - from now on you'll remember what you've done
You'll be cryin', you'll be tryin' not to fall
Now - now you see, life is just a memory
You'll be cryin', you 'll be tryin' to recall

Time will tell, faith was mine
Time will tell, would you bless me,
and caress me if I fell?

Sadly living through this irony
You'll forget me in the emptiness of time

[repeat chorus / solo / repeat chorus]
