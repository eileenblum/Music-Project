[chorus]
What, would you say
When I just walk away
With your heart in my heart
Into the final state?
What, would you say
When i just walk away

A teerless cry, an endless sleep
A true life elexier is what you need
You're not able to look into my eyes
The devil is riding on the wind tonight
While the moon glows and is burning hot
As my blood flows I can feel the final shot
The silver shot

[repeat chorus]

I just walk into the torrential sea
I just walk and walk and take with me
All my dreams, my hopes, and my memories
There are other worlds, worlds than this
So I just follow my inner dreams
while I lost my mind within this therapy

[repeat first four lines of chorus twice]
