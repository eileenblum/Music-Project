When a game begins to get a drama
Connecting subculture and decadence
Nothing is such exciting as life

A surf of beauties lewd and lavish
Wear and tear the soul, loose the substance
Nothing is such exciting as life

He was a bird flying into a snare
Not knowing the fate awaiting it there

When the world is laying straight in front of you
So come on in and find out in instalments
Nothing is such exciting as life

[repeat verse 2 + bird bridge (x2)]

Nothing is such exciting as life
