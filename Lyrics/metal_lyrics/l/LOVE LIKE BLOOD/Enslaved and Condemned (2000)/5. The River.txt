You will never can imagine
This unvoiced desperation
It's not written on my face
Leaving behind resignation

[pre-chorus]
Reaching out for the first reach
With a strangled smile I'd let you go
Leaving behind emptiness
It hurts more than you'll ever know

[chorus]
And the river, and the river flows
Strong the wild
And the fever, and the fever grows
Fiery by passion

In the dark and torrid ocean
All the hearts are lying there
Lost for love, waiting for rebirth
I get sick, I feel it rising there

[repeat pre-chorus / chorus / solo / chorus]

Torrential like a river
Consuming like a fever
And the current, and the current, and the current flows
