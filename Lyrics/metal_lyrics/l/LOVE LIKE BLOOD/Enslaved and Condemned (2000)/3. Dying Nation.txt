Dark clouds over this nation
They are dark like once before
They are the same slogans again
A sense of new honour

They spread forbidden thoughts
A spirit of another time
To build up another state
To build up another crime

Another crime
But we are not to die in this dying nation

Ignorance and bigotry, are the things we gotta stop
If it carries on this way they will never give it up
There's of other bullshit apart from the red white and blue
Theres a lot of people thinking the same way as we do

Another crime, another crime
But we are not to die in this dying nation
Another crime, another dying nation
But we are not to die in this dying nation

Ridiculous bubbled phrases
Of a rotten red hypothesis
An anarchistic decleration to build up another crime

Another crime
But we are not to die in this dying nation
Another crime, another dying nation
But we are not to die in this dying nation
