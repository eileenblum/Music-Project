This history is based on someones damnation
Like a course of depreciation
There is no change within that generation
Only ignorance can fight against frustration

Violation

The trial failed to set up the integration
No end in sight of this separation
The story is going on with violation
The racial murders all over the nation

Violation - There is no hope in sight
There is no approach to life
There is no hope in sight, in sight

So the story goes on and on
And everybody knows how that war begun
But at the time they did not know what they have done

Violation - There is no hope in sight
There is no approach to life
There is no hope in sight, in sight
There is no hope in sight
There is no approach to life
There is no hope in sight, in sight
