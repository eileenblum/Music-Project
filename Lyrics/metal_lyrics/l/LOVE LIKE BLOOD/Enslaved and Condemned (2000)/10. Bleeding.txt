I hear your voice, I hear you cry
You sense the doubt inside my mind
Voices scream heaven and voices scream hell
All those words I used to know so well

Now I turn around with a pensive smile
Now I turn around, yeah I turn around, with tears in my eyes

[chorus (x2)]
This blood flows for you again
This blood it flows so cold

Me, I wrote a farewell note
Remembering how he have passed all our time
Things I said were sometimes not too clear
Although I truly loved you so dear

When you see me fall with a strangled smile
When you see me fall, yeah you see me fall, with bloodshot eyes

[repeat chorus]

I've always tried to suppress my emotions
I tried to keep the land between our oceans
This love was just something passionate
And the sensations soon gonna fade again

[repeat chorus]
