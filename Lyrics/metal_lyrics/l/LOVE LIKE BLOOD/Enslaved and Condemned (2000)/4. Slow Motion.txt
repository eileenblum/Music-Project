I wanna make you fear and let you fall
I wanna see you naked body shaking
Did you ever feel yourself so helpless?
Have you every felt such humiliation
In such a helpless situation?

I wanna smell you and I smell your sweat
I wanna taste you and I taste your blood
I wanna kiss you when you are dead
I get closer so I can feel you breath

[pre-chorus]
Closer and closer, I breathe your breath
Closer and closer, I touch your teeth

[chorus]
Have you ever seen your whole world so small
In such such a slow, slow motion?
Have you ever tried to see it through my eyes?
With such sweet, sweet emotion

[repeat pre-chorus + chorus]

Seems like somethings gonna happen with you

[repeat chorus]
