In the endless deep from eternal sleep I rise
Someone broke the seal and now I'm to reveal, but is it wise?
When the ocean's roar washes to the shore, you see
In my hungry arms its my love that harms eternally

[chorus]
Love kills, love kills, love kills
It's goin down and down, down and down
Love kills, love kills, love kills
Down and down, down and down
Love Kills

From my bed of weed I can feel the greed in you
Sealed is your fate cause love and hate is what you do
On the easy path to the tune of wrath, you dwell
And a peaceful wave at the shore I gave to you is my farewell

[repeat chorus]

An idle talk is all your craft
A nothing in the flood of guilt and mediocrity
And still your trace is blood
What you once loved you will destroy
What once went up comes down...

Love kills
