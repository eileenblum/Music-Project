You try to dream, but you are not able to sleep
You want to scream, but you can not even speak
You want to walk, but you just started to creep
And when you talk you always feel so weak

A promise you can't keep
Please don't try to flee

It's just a passionate act of desperation

You hear a voice, a voice inside your hear
Some gun that speaks, "I wanna see you dead"
Insane thoughts, that you don't dare to say
Not now, not here and never not this way

Don't try to run away

It's just a passionate act of desperation
It's just a passionate
Just a passionate act of desperation

Your broken heart it beats in fever
It beats in pain, deeper and deeper

It's just a passionate act of desperation
It's just a passionate
Just a passionate act of desperation
Just a passionate
Just a passionate
Just a passionate
Just a passionate
Yeah just a passionate
