So you wanna bury me 
Put me in the dirt
Crucify me for my sins in the name of those I hurt
But who gon' carry me with blood all in my shirt
Two strikes against me
On my way to the third

And it hurts, and it hurts ha, for what's its worth
Never giving anyone what they didn't deserve
My due's paid, my time served, and I'll take that to my grave 
So you can put me in the hearse 
(And I'll take that to my grave so you can put me in the hearse)

No more
Praying for rain that never came [2x]
Swearing to a god that don't know me by name
And you can all get fucked 
Sick of being tested by these pussies who don't want it [2x]
They don't want it 

The realest stakes? Ha, leaves realest-ness 
And I didn't have to lie I didn't make up shit
And you can check the paper work I didn't make up shit
And I'll do it all again I'll stand by what I did
But what you call someone who gossips and talks shit?
That's a bitch
That's a bitch
And I ain't dropping names 
'Cause I ain't trying to bring you fame
But you's a bitch
And a snitch, ha
(But you's a bitch
And a snitch, ha)

No more
Praying for rain that never came [2x]
Swearing to a god that don't know me by name
And you can all get fucked 
Sick of being tested by these pussies who don't want it [2x]
They don't want it 

Ha, yea they don't want it
Sick of being tested by these pussies who don't want it
They don't want it 

I may be bent (I may be bent)
But motherfucker I ain't broke
So you can keep taking notes 
And you can hang on every quote
My every lies that I wrote
I'm gone
