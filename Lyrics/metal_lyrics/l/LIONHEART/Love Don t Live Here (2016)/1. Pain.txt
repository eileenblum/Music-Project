[Verse]
Pain is the feeling you get
When your work three jobs just to pay the rent
Pain is a feeling inside
When you can't make it without help, so you swallow your pride
Pain, at the bottom of your stomach
Tryna make the right moves, but some of them wasn't
Pain is the crack in your heart
From all the love lost, yeah it tore you apart

[Chorus:]
Damn! It cuts so deep
Damn! I can't breathe
Damn! It cuts so deep
Damn! I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
Pain! I've made so many mistakes
Wish they were mine to make
So I've got no one to blame
Pain, yeah I know you feel it too
Backs against the wall, and I got nowhere to move,
Like

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
These walls keep closing in
These walls keep closing in
I can't breathe!
Hands around my throat, I can't take it anymore
Chocking the life out of me
I can't breathe!
Hands around my throat, I can't take it anymore
Chocking the life out of me
All these cracks in my heart,
Like the cracks on the streets
I can't find no peace
I can't find no peace
