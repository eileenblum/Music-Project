Dear mama,
I wanna apologize
For those nights you spent crying tears in your eyes cos you knew, that I had problems and
Ain't nobody can solve 'em and now
I'm slipping and falling it ain't often I cry, but in a casket I lie
I swear to god depression is eating me alive and
So I look to the sky
But there ain't nobody there
So I put my head down and sigh can you feel it cos I feel it too can you feel it hoping and wishing the floor of my kitchen try to fight off the snakes
Try to juggle prescriptions
This ain't livin'!
is anyone listening
can I get a witness I said can I get a witness can you feel it cos I feel it too can you feel it this pain I cant shake nightmares in my sleep but it hurts more to be awake
