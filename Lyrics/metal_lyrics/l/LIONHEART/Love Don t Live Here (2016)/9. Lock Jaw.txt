Rest in peace
'Cause I know you dying for attention
Bearing false witness

You just dying to be mentioned
And it's so sad
To watch you struggle with your thoughts
Tryna get a grip you thought you special but you not
And I bet you love this track
So I hope you break your neck
When that beat come back
And I know your still thirsty
Going through withdrawals
But you know you can't hang
Keep fucking around I know
You begging for that lock jaw
