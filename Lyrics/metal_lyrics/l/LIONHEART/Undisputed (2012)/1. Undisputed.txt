Yea I come from the bottom.
Don't talk to me about problems, I got em.
Don't talk to me about hell 'cause I live there.
Wake up everyday, man I'm still there.
Stare down the barrel, so go ahead and squeeze.
I wish they would, the only man I feel is me.
I've been through hell and back.
And I am...

Undisputed!
