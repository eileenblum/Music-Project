One life
One pain

My struggle for the rest of my days
Ive got one life and its full of pain
My struggle for the rest of my days

YEEAAHHHH!

They said I'd be a lifer,
Forever locked up
Like I chose to be this fucked up
When I look back I still feel that pain

I still feel their pain

Cus they sign me up, we have to play with the kid
Cus they take goats, Reverend Chan's chicken
but now im 25 and I know what you did
I will never forgive and I will never forget

One life
One pain
My struggle for the rest of my days
Ive got one life and its full of pain

My struggle for the rest of my days

Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Or feeling like an animal
Sick and tired of your chapstick spine

So how you like me now? MMMUH!

So how you like me now?

One life
One pain
My struggle for the rest of my days
Ive got one life and its full of pain

My struggle for the rest of my days

One life
One pain
My struggle for the rest of my days
Ive got one life and its full of pain

My struggle for the rest of my days

God granted me the serenity so accept this pain,
The courage to keep on fighting,
And the wisdom to know my enemies,
Muthuh FUCKuhs!

Rest in peace to my enemies!

Rest in peace to my enemies!
