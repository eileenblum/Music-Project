Dedicated to the snakes
And the ones who disrespect my name
I've never folded, never caved
Until they bury me
6 feet deep
Until they bury me
6 feet deep
Until they bury me

Through rain and mud
The bottom of the barrel
Is where I am from
My mother's only son
Born a lion
I fear no one

6 feet deep
Until they bury me
6 feet deep
Until they bury me

I fear no one
I remain relentless
I fear no one
I remain relentless

I've never folded, never caved
I remain relentless

Until they bury me

I've never folded, never caved
I remain relentless
I've never folded, never caved
I remain relentless

Until they bury me

All the snakes
They tried and tried
They tried and tried
Ran their mouth
They lied and lied

Couldn't believe
That I came from nothing
Couldn't believe
That I became something

I said I came from nothing
And I became something
6 feet deep
