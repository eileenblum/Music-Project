Now the struggle is the root of all evil
What's that make you? I guess it makes me the devil
Divide by the pain but the numbers won't settle
Because when it rains it pours, it rips right through your shelter
It rips right through your home and cuts deep in your heart
Handcuffs, knives and drugs; they tore my family apart
Like damn... This can't be all that life is: unpaid debts, no rest and fake friends

And when the numbers add up, the math still ends in subtraction
Divide by the pain, you're left with nothing but fractions
Imagine having the appetite of a beast 
But it's hard to be a lion when there's nothing to eat
All these cracks in my heart like these cracks in the street
And I've been walking so much I swear I can't feel my feet
But I don't buckle, no matter the pressure

No matter the wind, the rain, no matter the weather
I am forever, this is the sound of the truth
this is the sound of the truth
