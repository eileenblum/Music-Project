Yeah I pray to god, but I ain't scared. 
And boy I been through hell and back, so you bet I stay prepared
Wrestled with them nightmares, in the middle of the night
Give a fuck about a snake and you can put that on my life

Cause every day when I wake, I take a look in the mirror
I see a man who doesn't break, it doesn't get any realer 

Fully decorated, I earned my stripes in the mud
I'm fully educated on hard times and tough love
So when I say I made it from down below to above
All I really mean is I don't need your respect

Every day when I wake, I take a look in the mirror
I see a man who doesn't break, it doesn't get any realer 

Hail Mary, full of grace. Send an angel down to protect me
Bury my haters, next to my enemies. 
Piss on all their graves, let them soak up the memories
