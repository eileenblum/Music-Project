Despicable, predictable.
I try and ignore the stench but it's impossible
I smell a rat and that's a fact. Call the exterminator and let him run that 
Let him confirm that, poison put him on his back. 
Arsenic up in his shit and give that rat a heart attack
More vicious than a flesh wound. Better die a roach's death soon

I smell a rat, you better watch your back
I smell a rat, you better watch your

Face down in the gutter, back stabbing, caught lying mother fucker
The definition of a snake, you never give you just take and you take and you take
But I will never let up and I will never give up, 'til you're exposed and that's that
So you can run and hide an you can live lies
But I'm coming for you and that's a wrap

I smell a rat, you better watch your back
I smell a rat, you better watch your
you better watch your back

Ain't running shit but your mouth every time that we see ya
Spittin' that venom like you're the neighborhood preacher
But I ain't gotta less lies or fabricate on what's real
And I ain't hard to find, just put your bitch behind the wheel
You fucking rat
