Welcome to the west coast, where we at, we at Northern California
Welcome to the west coast, what you banging, this is LHHC

I started this band in 2004. Give a fuck about a label, I just wanted to tour
And yeah, I had a dream: "I wanna see the world"
And this music took me places I'd never been before
God damn yeah, in 2008 toured with Skarhead and Bulldoze and they showed us the way.
First time on the East Coast and can't forget they showed us love but couldn't wait to get back out West
California's where we're from

Welcome to the west coast, where we at, we at Northern California
Welcome to the west coast, what you banging, this is LHHC

Now three albums later, I've still got love for the scene
From Europe to Japan and back and everywhere in between
Shout out to everyone who stuck by us through and through
And Northern California, god damn it we love you

Welcome to the west coast, where we at, we at Northern California
Welcome to the west coast, what you banging, this is LHHC

From the basements, to the stage. Through it all, we stood tall, we made our own way
