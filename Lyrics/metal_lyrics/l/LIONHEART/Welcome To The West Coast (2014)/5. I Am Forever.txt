Deep down in the valley of the shadow of death
I face the odds head on, pause and catch my breath
Then it's fuck you all with a fist made from steel 
R.I.P to my enemies, you know I'm for real 

I am, I am forever

All the way back from I never left
Forever undisputed and the rest is a wrap, like that

Born to die but I'm alive, born to die but I kept my head held high
Born to die and that's no lie, these vultures will take you or all you got if you stand by

I am, I am forever

Comin' live, nothing to prove. I swear to god, ain't got a damn thing to lose
So let me speak my mind, forever undisputed. You can put that on my life
