Fuck the world, and anyone who doubted me
Never needed anyone, all I need is me
Seen so much shit I swear I'm numb
There's nothing you can do to me, that hasn't been done
Fuck the world and while I'm at it
Fuck you too
Seen a lot of fakes, and I've had it
Fuck you too
Snakes and fakes is all I ever see
What do you when your world breaks and you have nothing?
Keep your head up high, stare em' straight in the face
Two fingers in the air singing this with me:
Fuck the world and while I'm at it
Fuck you too
Seen a lot of fakes, and I've had it
Fuck you too
Fuck em all they never meant shit
and they can suck my dick
How many of them:
have been broken and beat?
How many of them:
have fucking lived on the streets?
How many of them:
know about what it takes?
How many of them:
know a damn thing about me?

[Chad]
It was never supposed to be like this, I swear to god I'm numb
I can't feel a fucking thing, I swear my heart is gone
I ain't got no love, only time for hate
'Cause this fucking world drained it out of me
