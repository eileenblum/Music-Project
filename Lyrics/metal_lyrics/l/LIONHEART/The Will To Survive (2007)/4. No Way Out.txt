This world will pull you down.
Gotta fight to survive
just to make it out alive
and that's real.

Got laid off on a tuesday night,
two weeks later the money ran dry.
Can't turn on the heat, can't afford the lights.
How's he gonna make this right?
Got a wife all alone with two kids at home
and one on the way.
And he can't find a job so he lost his car.
Now the rent is late.
Theres gotta be a better way.

This world will pull you down.
Gotta fight to survive
just to make it out alive
and that's real.

Down at the liquor store,
He's pacing back and forth in front of the door.
Pulls the ski mask over his head,
prays to god and decides, it's time to go in.
"Now everybody get the fuck on the floor.
This ain't like me, iv'e never done this before.
Just give me the money and noone gets hurt."
Then one shot from a cop left him dead on the floor.

Step back, and take a look within.
Are you that much different from him?
where the fuck do you draw the line
on how to survive?

This world will pull you down.
Gotta fight to survive
just to make it out alive
and that's real.

Times like these
pull crimes like these
out of honest men.
over and over again.
