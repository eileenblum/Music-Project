I have no regrets
i've made choices and i stand by them
while you, you try and judge my life
you wouldn't understand so dont waste your time
been through alot over the years
I don't remember when my heart turned cold
always played the hand i was dealt
can't be an angel when you're living...
in hell
These scars speak for themselves
in hell
These scars speak for themselves

This is who i am. This is where I'm from. Ain't sorry for shit.
This is who I am. This is where I'm from. Ain't sorry for shit that I've done.

Still negative as fuck and there's nothing you can do.
Still negative as fuck and i ain't gonna change for you, change for you.

I ain't sorry for shit
I know it's fucked but that's how it is.
Down, but never out
always taught to seek the crown
cause in this life you gotta take what's yours
no matter what the cost.
Fuck the haters and fakes
i'm gonna get mine if it takes all day
cause life won't wait.
Life won't wait.

This. Is. Who. I. Am. (aint gonna change for you)
