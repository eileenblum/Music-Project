I don't feel and I don't love, not anymore
A blacked-out heart that will never heal
I'm not even close
Cause I lost so much, it ain't coming back
Down and out, with the world on my back
So I looked within, channeled my hate
Turned it into strength, and there's no other way

Cause I can't look at anyone
Without hating every part of them
Everything fucking makes me sick
And the only thing I love is the fact that I hate
Fuck everyone and everything
I'd spit in all your faces, if I could
I hate you, I even hate me
Teeth fucking clenched
Cause I'm filled with hate

Filled with hate
