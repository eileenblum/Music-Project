When I feel the fucking bitter and cold. Filled with more hate than anyone I've known.

When I feel the fucking empty inside.

44 years old, boy ready to die.

When I steal, just don't give a fuck. Invited no one because there's no one I trust.

When I steal, fucking leave this place. Negative as fuck and being right in your face.

I have to bend before the break. I have a nightmare that you create. Negative as fuck. I have to never, will never give a fuck.

Living life with that gun in my mouth. Pull that trigger spit that bullet back out. Fuck the world. Go ahead and try me.

Living life with that gun in my mouth. Pull that trigger spit that bullet back out. Fuck the world. You better drive by me.

Spit that bullet back out.

Gone through everything. Standing in my way

Gone through everyone and everything.
