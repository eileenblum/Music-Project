Like a pack of wolves,
Creeping amongst the sheep
No remorse, no code,
You took advantage of the weak.

One, you will reap what you sew.
Two, this will haunt you wherever you go.

I am the reaper,
The swinging hammer of revenge,
More relentless, than youâll ever know
I am the nightmare that never ends

One, you will reap what you sew.
Two, this will haunt you wherever you go.

With one in the chamber,
Now thatâs justice!!!

Pathetic, rejected,
You've been reduced to nothing!

Bow before me now,
You fucking snake
Youâre a liar, and a coward, and a fake
And I'll piss all overâ¦ your remains!
