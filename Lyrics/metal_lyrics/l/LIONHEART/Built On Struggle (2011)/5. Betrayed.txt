A lie for a lie
A heart for a heart
A life for a life
I hope that tears you apart

Forced to believe there was something wrong with me
Treated like an animal all my life
Step on every thing I love
Treated like a fucking criminal
Never again! Never again!

Remember me I bet you will
Slither like a snake you have become
Disconnected out of touch
I just don't give a fuck
Trust no one! Trust no one
Thrown out by those closest to me
Abandoned betrayed completely
Never again! Never again!
Remember me I bet you will
Slither like a snake you have become

Damn right this song is about you

You snake motherfuckers
Betrayed by my own fucking family
You watched me drown

Force feed the justice down your fucking throat
Betrayed by everyone no fucking home
Force feed the justice down your fucking throat

With just your self

Remember me who is the animal now
