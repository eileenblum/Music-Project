Yes I am!
My brother's keeper! (my brother's keeper)
I remain true to you, no matter what you do!
Looking in your eyes,
I can see the loss and
I cans see the pain,
Why don't you look back at me, we see different things,
This is your song!
These are your words!
And you can scream it with me, so scream it with me!
Yes I am!
My brother's keeper! (my brother's keeper)
Do you remember, when the world was ours, it was the world I came in!
Well what a road it's been, so this one's for you until we meet again!
Until we meet again!
Until we meet again!
Yes
I am my brother's keeper and
I don't back down!
And we won't back down!
I remain my brother's keeper, and I won't back down!
Until we meet again!
This is your song!
These are your words!
And you can scream it with me, so scream it with me!
This is your song!
These are your words!
And you can scream it with me, so scream it with me!
