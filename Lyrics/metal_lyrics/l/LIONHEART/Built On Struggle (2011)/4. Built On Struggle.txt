No more
Nights spent
Praying for better days
Although I waited
They never came

No more
Holding on
To the pain inside
Spit that dirt out of my mouth
From being buried alive

I am a pitbull
Set to attack
Dug myself out of my grave
And now I'm back

I am the animal
That you fear inside
I've been broken and beaten
But I came out alive

Through it all
Through the worst
Through the pain
And the loss
And the hurt

I never gave up
I never gave in
'cause something burns inside
And no one could ever take it

I was built
Built on struggle
I remain
That way
I was built
Built on struggle
Never forget
Where you come from

I am not my failures
I am not my fears

Looking forward
To looking back on
Those kind of days
I used to wanna forget
No more
Looking to the sky
Spit that dirt out of my mouth
From being buried alive

I am not my failures
I am not my fears
I am not my failures
I am not my fears
I am not my failures
I am not my fears
I am not my failures
I am not my fears
I am not my failures
I am not my fears
I am not my failures
I am not my fears
