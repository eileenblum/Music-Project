You're selling lies
To anyone who'll buy
A fucking wolf in a sheeps disguise
It ain't music, without a message.
It's just a fad and in time it'll die.

And you know who you are, 
So keep nodding your head cause i'm talking to you.

BURN
BURN
Choking on the hand that feeds

And now you're all fucking 
DEAD
You dug your own grave,
You only care about the money you made.
DEAD
With no more lies to sell
Take that fake ass shit and go fuck yourself.
DEAD
You're dead and gone,
Remembered by no one.
DEAD
And your dues ain't paid
On your knees like a bitch,
Face down in flames.

Burn face down in fucking flames.
Face down in flames.

Choking on the hand that feeds.
