Pure Anger
True Pain
Dead Inside
I was born that way

Fuck it all
Never look back

You weren't there
You don't know me
Walk a day in my life
Then judge me

There were choices I had to make
Time served, my dues have been paid.

Dead inside
Full of hate until I die
I've been the same way my wholelife
That's pure anger. [x2]

Still bitter, still cold
From day one, the life I know.
But that's real, that's me
Pure fucking anger I was born that way.

Pure fucking anger. [x2]

Dead inside
Full of hate until I die
I've been the same way my whole life
That's pure anger. [x2]

Stood tall while others fell
I took life, lived it for myself
Me against the world every time
The fuel that burns is the anger inside.

It's me against the world every time
The fuel that burns is the anger inside.

Pure fucking anger. [x2]

This is real hate, This is true pain.
Pure fucking anger.
This is real hate, This is true pain.
Pure fucking anger.
