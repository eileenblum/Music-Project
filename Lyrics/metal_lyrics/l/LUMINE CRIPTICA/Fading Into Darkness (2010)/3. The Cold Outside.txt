There are no ways with no faith in me
Waiting the sun to go down
No more secrets to reveal hidden inside
All the shadows faded in the dark

Now I see clear, I'm the only one near
On my side, over my pain

When my winter comes along
With the cold outside the window
I'm frozen

When my winter comes along
All the sadness that's staying in my eyes
Pulls me back

Wake me up,
I can see you falling
Come now,
You can make my blood run
What I did, I can't start
You can see me I am frozen
Now I fear time is up
You can make my blood run

Don't know where I'm going through
There are no signs to follow
I'm stacked with no soul, lack of bravery

Heal me wherever you are
Hear my weak cry
Guide me where I can do
Whatever I believe

Now it's time to believe

When my winter comes along
With the cold outside the window
I'm frozen

When my winter comes along
All he sadness that's staying in my eyes
Pulls me back

When my winter comes along
With the cold outside the window
I'm frozen

When my winter comes along
The warm places that I built to survive
Collapse down
