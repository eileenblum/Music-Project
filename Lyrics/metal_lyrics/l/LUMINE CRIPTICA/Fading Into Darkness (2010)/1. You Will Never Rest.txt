Sigh in the middle of the storm
Removal of a time that's hiding
Under the frost of this indefinite winter
Intoxicate with his own breath is waiting
The rust to corrode his misery

Condemned to a new direction
Hoping for the wind in favor
Hallucinating with returning
Don't even dream of waking up
From this nightmare that will fall apart
If you can open your eyes tonight

Where has the last wind gone?
What place has found to alight?
If it's stolen by the time
Drag me within

Breathe deeply
Eroding with your immortal flying
Like the rocks resist the strike of the salt
You will never rest

Where I can see with no light
Where you embrace me
A forgotten shadow left behind
I won't be
You'll leave
I won't leave
You'll leave your body by the grace of god
You'll never own me once again
Elaborating senseless rituals
To escape from me

Sweeping his own fantasies away
Forgetting the emptiness
Knowing nothing's gonna change
Renounce the unreality
Image the fire ruins and rises again
Using the same ashes
