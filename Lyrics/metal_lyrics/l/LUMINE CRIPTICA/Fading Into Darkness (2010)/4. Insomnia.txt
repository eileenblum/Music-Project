The end of time
Will find the sleep at night
Dreaming he's awake
Waiting to create
Disorder, insomnia,
Haunting like a raven and then
You'll lament what you had.

Would you believe in the hope of the fallen?
The whispered ones will forget once they drowned

Disorder, insomnia,
Haunting like a raven and then
You'll lament what you had.

When the blind man who guides me sees again
And the footsteps behind me fades away
The goddess of fortune will scream out my name.

Would you forgive once the sorrow
Has carved so deep in your soul
To dry out your tears?

Disorder, insomnia,
Haunting like a raven and then
You'll lament what you had.

Heal my wound,
Find me the cure,
The Time erases every thought you had.

You don't know what I've feel
Never lying down to sleep
Yearning the black abyss

My past is dying, I'm dying with him,
Sleepless I will pay my sins.

You don't know what I need
The dawn of souls, inside of me
Waiting silently

Trapped inside my scarred skin
No river will ever quench my thirst

Insomnia
Mixture of anguish, pleasure and pain
My heartbeat lose time, my blood runs back in my veins
Every second I'm closer to my final rest

Heal my wound,
Find me the cure,
The Time erases what you left behind.

You don't know what I've feel
Never dreaming when I'm asleep
Yearning the black abyss

My past is dying, I'm dying with him,
Sleepless I will pay my sins.

You don't know what I need
The grab your souls, inside of me
Waiting silently

Trapped inside my scarred skin
No river will ever quench my thirst
