Keep me waiting
As I'm sentenced
(I should have known)
Don't turn the lights off

D'you see, I break down
All expectations
That I can reach,
I can keep it all untight

This rage became my enemy
And reflects my secret,
A black crow flying ruthless
Over my self esteem

Oh leave me cry alone
Until the roar begins

Shadows are clouding inside,
The weakness of my mind
Whispering once and again
I was meant to fail.

Twisting and turning around blackest ground
Revealing no truth calm me down
Seeking, always searching
Reaching the horizons no one can deny

Through thousand paths, one threnody
Wanders to stalk my dreams
Heartless desires of purity
Leaving me unfulfilled

I don't need no hope
This guilt is everlasting

Slowly I'm choking with fire
My voice bears a disaster
Silence is now all I have
To disguise who I am

I don't remember wearing my face
This cold lake is lying again
My compass never warned me
The ghost I most fear lies behind my eyes

Silent distress
Burden of faith

No one to blame
Covering the shade inside

Am I heading to a senseless
Decay of sympathy?

Am I heading to the point where
My trust remains inside?

Lust for darkness
Decay of sympathy

Leading my will
My trust remains inside
