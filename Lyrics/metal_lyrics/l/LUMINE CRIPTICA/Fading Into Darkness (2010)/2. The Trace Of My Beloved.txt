I belong to this memory,
With your sick past laughing at me
All my hopes fade for what I've done
Leaving my old self behind

Am I hiding behind the trees?
Nothing scares me, follow me
In the silence you might hear me
Whispering the words you dream about

Not allowed to be free again
Chains of love and lust attaching my pain
Feel my wounds, feel my fantasies
Drop your water on my thirsty skin

Am I hiding behind the trees?
Nothing scares me, follow me
In the silence you might hear me
Whispering the words you dream about

Embrace the thousand tears you waste
An endless time of indifference and passion
Becomes the trace of my beloved
The answers that i can't forbid
Nor hide under my scar.

How can I resist the light?
Pain refresh my numb sense of life
Apathy dressed in smiles and distant looks of pleasure
Love stains spilled as every word tight my rope
Your frozen breath clouds the mirror of forgiveness and regret
Sparing me from mortals finding warm only in my blood
