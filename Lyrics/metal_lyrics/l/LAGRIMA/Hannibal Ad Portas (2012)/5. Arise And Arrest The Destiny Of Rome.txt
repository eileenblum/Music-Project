Falling â¦ fallingâ¦ the walls are falling
Screamingâ¦ screamingâ¦ youâll be screaming
Bleedingâ¦ bleedingâ¦ your men are bleeding
Womenâ¦ weepingâ¦ for u they will be weeping

Blood and guts grime our swords
Heads on spikes pleasure our gods

Standingâ¦ standingâ¦ tall and mighty
Reachingâ¦ touchingâ¦ the heavens above
Daringâ¦ willingâ¦ to conquer all
To ascend the albsâ¦ to touch on the skiesâ¦ triumph in our gripâ¦ till the eternity

Elephants, men and horses
As ghosts we move concealed
Through forests and rivers
Obscured from eyes we march

Through mountain rims we cross
Blizzards we all defy
All tribes we tame
To our cause they strive

Many they fall
Engulfed by snow
Weariness will never
Put us down

At last we see
The green fields ahead
The gates of Rome
Will rumble now

Battles and clashes
History will amend

Kingdom made
From soil

And to soil
It will return

Under our feet
Mere ruins

It shall
Buuuuuurn
