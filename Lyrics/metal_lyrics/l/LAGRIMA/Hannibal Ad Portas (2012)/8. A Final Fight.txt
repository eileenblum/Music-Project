A final stand, a final fight
On our land, the deceive strike
Invaders we were, Defenders weâve come

Outside the walls
We gaze at death

All our deeds, all our feats
Now nothing means in deed
Desert winds awaits to engulf the dead

Outside our walls
We embrace war

Treason swept our troops
Nomads deflected to the enemy
A colossal beast we face
But brave and proud we stand

Horns are blown
Decisive it will be
At Zama the due
An amuse for âDeathâ

Charging elephants
Scattered and alarmed
Horns of fear
Down they fall

All seems lost
Braver we fought
But battle is lost
The war is lost

A shameful peace
We desert our arms
We desert our pride

To the Roman beast
In Hesitate
We now bow

Hannibal
Reside as a threat
Will have to flee

(From court to court)
Bewail glories of the past
What doom will await

Weary
And all is lost

Captive
Will never transpire

His fate
His to claim

Poison
Will rest his soul

To be
Engulfed by the sea

In honor
All will end

The heart
Of Rome

At last
Will be at ease
