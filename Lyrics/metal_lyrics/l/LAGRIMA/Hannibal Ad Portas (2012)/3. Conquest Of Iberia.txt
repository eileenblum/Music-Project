Thundering heavens, roaring gods
Whispering to hamilkart,
(Whatâs to come: )
A concealed land beyond the sea
Awaits the beloved
(Sons of Baal)
From inside the palace chambers
Plans of conquest are in progression

Masterminds assembled in,

All to the lands of
(Silver and gold)

Blessings of the gods to be taken
And all will have to swear
The alliance to Hammilkart

And the eternal hate to Rome
A pledge that young Hannibal
Will carry all his life

By the morning light
As the incense fills the air
All will allies the general

A ceremony of revere
Where all will swear
Their alliance to the cause

âYouâre going to carry these words
All your life
A hate that should grow
More and more

And my son
These word you will pass
To the ones who
Ride for you
And in blood Rome will pay
â¦And Rome will payâ¦
Blood

I swear that as soon as age will permit
I will use fire and steel
I will use fire and steel
To arrest the destiny of Romeâ

As the new colonies
Fills the shores of Spain their power
Their aspire is to be perturbed
Dark clouds
Shrouds the destiny of hammilkart
Oblivion to
His Death, his life will confine

Riding with his sons
By the river shores
Death looms on them afast

Tribes
Seeking revenge
His life will soon arrest

Not dread of
Whatâs to come?
Elusive away they ride

Martyr
Heâll become
So his sons would live on

His bodyâs lost
But his deeds
Will ever and ever reside
