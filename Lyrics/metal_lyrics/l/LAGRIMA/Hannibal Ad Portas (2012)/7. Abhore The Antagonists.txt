Warâ¦
At the gates of Rome
Hannibalâ¦
Ante portas

Hellâ¦
Will turn loose
Killing fieldsâ¦
Legions shall fall

First clashâ¦
Shores of Ticinus
Unwary Scipioâ¦
Wounded and defeated

Backâ¦
Legions retreat
First defeat
Mightier we get
--Semproniusâ¦
Filled with rush
Dead â¦
Would become

Flaminiusâ¦
Blindly in trap will fall
Fogs of death
Will engulf his men

Aemiliusâ¦
With mightiest of legions
3 to 1
80 thousand men

Engulfed
By the concave plan
Cannaeâ¦
The mightiest of battles

16 years will pass
And no one can rise
To prevail over the genius
Except for one man

With one insight
And will be known
As Scipio Africanus
And the famous lines

âTake the war to Carthageâ
Which will save
The walls of Rome
The wrath they dread

The Carthaginian dishearten
Called back their son
To defend and defeat
The luring enemy

Behind their gates
As he returned in hurry
With missing horsemen
The wind will change

(As African allies
Will aid Rome
With decisive element
Men on horses!)
