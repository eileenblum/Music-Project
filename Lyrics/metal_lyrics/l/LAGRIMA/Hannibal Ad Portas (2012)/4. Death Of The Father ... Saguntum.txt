Mourners gather from all around
Paying their final homage
Women dressed in black
Wail in sorrow and distress

Weeping skies mourn their beloved child
The sun shades its light behind
Rain drop as tears of weeping gods

And embraces his sleeping soul
Elevating in the pale grey sky
Up to the chambers of immortals
And have its eternal rest

Hasdrubal,
A new command
In Cartagena we - will revive

New lands
Our new gains
The tribes to us shall submit

Years
Years and years
Would pass with multi gain

Until
One shameful day
Hasdrubal is assassinated

Who,
Shall be the one in command

To sway us
Through this turmoil

And revenge
The death of our king

One man
The army hailed to sway

Hannibalâ¦ Hannibalâ¦ Hannibal

The army shall say its word
A man oblivion his name they call
Stepping up in the glazing sun
With his hand up they salute

Hannibalâ¦ Hannibalâ¦ Hannibal

Olcades, Vaccaeans, Carpesians
All fell to my hands

Tersosians, Iberians, Celtics
Will join my invasions

Sera Guadrama to me
It shall bow

All of Spain from the Tagus to the Ebro
Is in my iron grip

One city remains aside
This city then made a big slip-up
Our realm is never to be assailed
Saguntum shall pay for its acts

Just one more campaign
Just one more siege to be done
Eight month in the count
And death shall engulf the assailants
