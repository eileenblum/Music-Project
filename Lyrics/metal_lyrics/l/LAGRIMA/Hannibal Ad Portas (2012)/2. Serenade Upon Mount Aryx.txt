By the shores of sicilia
On mountains under crimson skies
Blowing winds, running wild
Climbing the steeply cliffs

While an adolescent boy
Watches the vast wide shores
And the rising mighty sun
From beyond the deep

From the forest roads
To the Carthisian camp
The last stand on the Italian shores
To be delivered to the Roman troops

Oh sweet land that is stolen
Oh sweet land that is usurped

The great Hammilkart
Prepares the army to retreat
As the signing of the treaty is done
Ships from home land will come

Oh sweet land that is stolen
Oh sweet land that is usurped

And young Hannibal observes
The ships of surrender, they come
To carry whatâs left
Of mercenary army
Back home

And the soil of Carthage land
That long forgotten here they respite
And another chapter is fold
So another will begin

With civil war that will delay
The plans of hammilkart
Of a new colony
In a new land to defy the Roman power

And whatâs to come
In the distant future
And what will be known of a young boy that willâ¦

From the lands of Spain
Will raise an army
To a land far beyond
To Rome itself
