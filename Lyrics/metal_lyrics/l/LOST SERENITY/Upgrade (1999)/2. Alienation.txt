Destiny's right, I'm known to survive
We're only here for another day
Destiny's right, I'm known to survive
We've made our plans on this final day
Breaking it up
Breaking it up
Breaking it up now

Please wake me up from this nightmare
Never enough on this nightly ride
Time to move on 'cause it's almost over

Well I'll be
Leaving it all in this nightmare
Memorize thoughts in this night gone blank
Opening up 'cause I'm sick of waiting for this

There's got to be a man who dares it all
Who knows all the secrets
Who tells you why
There's got to be a reason not to know
I've got to find the strength to carry on

Destiny's right, I'm known to survive
We're only here for another day
Destiny's right, I'm known to survive
We've made our plans on this final day
Breaking it up
Breaking it up
Breaking it up now

Fearing it all in this daydream
Erasing it all in this day gone black
Pushing it all 'cause I need to know now

I would be
Trying to hide in this daydream
Taking my time in this day gone bad
Please wake me up
'Cause the world rests on my shoulders

There's got to be a man who dares it all
Who knows all the secrets
Who tells you why
There's got to be a reason not to know
I've got to find the strength to carry on

Destiny's right, I'm known to survive
We're only here for another day
Breaking it up
Breaking it up
Breaking it up now
Destiny's right, I'm known to survive
We've made our plans on this final day
Breaking it up
Breaking it up
Breaking it up now

I've taken it all 'cause it's easy
Rewinding thoughts known as memories
Taken it all 'cause the show is over
I've taken it all 'cause it's easy
Writing my lines as the riddle says
Taken it all 'cause I'm always on my way

I've taken it all
Could not belong
Never a thought without reason
With a lie
With a smile
With a reason why
I'll never be part of the season

And I ache and I cry and I feel and sigh and I hate
And I crawl and hide
And I ache and I cry and I feel and sigh and I hate
And I crawl and hide
I'll always try
But I have one question:
Why?
