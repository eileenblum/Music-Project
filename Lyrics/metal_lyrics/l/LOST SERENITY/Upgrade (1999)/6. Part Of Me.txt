Inside I hurt
Unheard
It might be just a frozen word

Outside I'm strong
Belong
It might just be a spoken word

You lost your meaning for me
Through faked integrity
Another one who stabs and tries to walk away shot free
Don't try to disagree
Don't ever stare you see
I'm here to protect number one and that's enough of me

âLadies and gentlemen,
Are you ready for this personal trial?
Please rise,
'Cause my court is in session.
I find the defendant guilty as charged.â

Leave me floating in the sea
I've let it become a part of me
And let the guilt trip win again and again
Unknown by tomorrow
You've reached a point of no return
Credibility's at stake
'Cause when a mind is lost
Finally
A part of me is not mistaken
The mind is lost
Yesterday's apology has lost its meaning

Inside I burn
Wrong turn
To find a reason to survive

Outside I'm cold
Untold
The only means to stay alive

Lights out
Arise
Take the blame and
Take the fall and
End it right

Final stroke
Lose again
You've opened thoughts
And closed our chapter
Killed by words

Leave me floating in the sea
I've let it become a part of me
And let the guilt trip win again and again
Unknown by tomorrow
You've reached a point of no return
Credibility's at stake
'Cause when a mind is lost
Finally
A part of me is not mistaken
The mind is lost
Yesterday's apology has lost its meaning

You're all alone
Nobody knows
The day will come
I will destroy

âAnd now it's time for the final verdict.
Have you got nothing to say
Before I spit out my sentence?
All comments overruled!
Will the defendant rise and fall!â

Leave me floating in the sea
I've let it become a part of me
And let the guilt trip win again and again
Unknown by tomorrow
You've reached a point of no return
Credibility's at stake
Yesterday won't be your day
