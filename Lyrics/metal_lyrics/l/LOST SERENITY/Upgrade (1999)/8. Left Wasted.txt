See me through the eyes of your enemy
Try me at the borderline
Darkness has a blinding effect on me
Waste it all, waste enough, wasting time
See me through the eyes of your enemy
Try me at the borderline
Darkness has a blinding effect on me
Waste it all, waste enough, wasting time

But then it starts
And you realize the pain
It is just another storyteller
Who wins again
My mind blew away
Another thought I created
I've found an end
So lock me up again

I will rise
'Cause it's all just a part of existence
I will rise
I don't need to pretend
I will rise
Until it's over and done
I will rise
So watch me break

Reason as become my mortality
Find me where you've lost your life
Leave me 'cause our distance was meant to be
Leave it all, leave enough
Leave this life

Reason as become my mortality
Find me where you've lost your life
Leave me 'cause our distance was meant to be
Leave it all, leave enough
Leave this life

But then it starts
And you realize the pain
It is just another storyteller
Who wins again
My mind blew away
Another thought I created
I've found an end
So lock me up again

I will rise
'Cause it's all just a part of existence
I will rise
I don't need to pretend
I will rise
Until it's over and done
I will rise
So watch me break

Don't tell me when it's time to stop
I know when to jump down
Don't tell me when it's time to stop
I know when to jump down
Don't tell me when it's time to stop
I know when to jump, jump down
Don't tell me when it's time to stop
I know when to jump, jump down
Don't tell me when it's time to stop
I know when to jump, jump down
Don't tell me when it's time to stop
I know when to jump, jump down

Now I'm back and I'm standing proud
Now I'm back in another timezone
Guess who's next, and I'm laughing loud
Guess who's next, not all memories are gone

Now I'm back and I'm standing proud
Now I'm back in another timezone
Guess who's next, and I'm laughing loud
Guess who's next, not all memories are gone

And tell me
Who to do, and tell me
Whom to beat
Tell me
Who to do, and tell me
Whom to beat

'Cause I ain't lying when I'm down
I ain't lying, wearing no crown
Tell me who is next in line until now
I've realized so many fears
So ask for time out
