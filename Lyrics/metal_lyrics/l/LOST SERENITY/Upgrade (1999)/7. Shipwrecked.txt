Heard it all so many times
I was there to comfort you and answer all your prayers
Come down from the wire
Caused all this pain in my heart

You said it all too many times
Should have known I'd analyze and compromise again
Come down from the wire
Caused all this pain in my heart

When you're tired, lonesome and there's no one left to lose
When you're running round in circles, running round in circles
Tired, lonesome and there's no one left to lose
Analyze and compromise, you'll make it all come true

When I'm home free again
Home free at last
Feeling saved when a memory past
Home free again
Home free at last
Feeling saved until I start again

Free at last
A mindless drop, erase the past
Leaving it all behind
Free at last
I'm trying to hear, I feel the lie
Leaving it all behind

When you're tired, lonesome and there's no one left to lose
When you're running round in circles, running round in circles
Tired, lonesome and there's no one left to lose
Analyze and compromise, you'll make it all come true

When I'm home free again
Home free at last
Feeling saved when a memory past
Home free again
Home free at last
Feeling saved until I start again

Free at last
A mindless drop, erase the past
Leaving it all behind
Free at last
I'm trying to hear, I feel the lie
Leaving it all behind

Free at last
A mindless drop, erase the past
Leaving it all behind
Free at last
I'm trying to hear, I feel the lie
Leaving it all behind
