Here I am
Top of the world
Top of the world
Top of my world
Damned fool
I'm ready to beat you

Did you realize you were a part of my problem
Did you realize that it's all in my head
Now I watched you with resistance, from a distance
Never a devotion, no emotion
You're looking down at me, but even down, I'm more up
I remember you much taller
I remember you, fuck

Throughout the years I've seen
So hear these cries that pound and burst within
My skin's been ripped before
We'll all fall down
All fall down 'cause it's part of my history
We all fall down a rage, insanity
Searching for sense but who are we
My stomach aches and there's no cure
I reach as day appears
We'll all fall down
All fall down 'cause it's part of my history
We all fall down and you know
That this was meant to be

Tick, tick, tick
I still am
Top of the world
Top of the world
Top of my world
Alright fool
I'm ready for round two

Have you ever tried to look inside and regret my situation
Or is all you ever think about your own fear and frustration?!
Redefine your deeds
Redefine your needs
Try to walk away
But you'll know I'll stay

Next round
Moment of testing
You know you can't win
Now I see through you
Are you ready for me?

Throughout the years I've seen
So hear these cries that pound and burst within
My skin's been ripped before
We'll all fall down
All fall down 'cause it's part of my history
We all fall down a rage, insanity
Searching for sense but who are we
My stomach aches and there's no cure
I reach as day appears
We'll all fall down
All fall down 'cause it's part of my history
We all fall down and you know
That this was meant to be
Fool!

I'm daring you
Preparing you
Another stone was crushed
That blocked my view

Hating you
Makes me feel it too
My war, a flashback
Meeting you

Feeling you
Resenting you
A day has passed
I'm still alive
No thanks to you

Meeting you
What I would do to you
My war, a flashback
Killing you

It's in my head
We'll all fall down
It's in my head

Making up a destiny
And making up time
So you've faced reality
Try and face crime

This is my reality
I've conquered the black
You've crossed the red line
Now there's no turning back

'Cause it's all in my head when I'm waking up
Find another lifeline!
Find another lifeline!

'Cause it's all in my head when I'm waking up
Find another lifeline!
Find another lifeline!
