He knows his way around
Many footsteps on his road
He knows the way it sounds
He's been fooled so many times
He only knows to sacrifice

Well welcome to my world
And welcome to my pain

These are the fears that last
These are the fears that won't go so fast
And become a memory
These are the years that last
These are the years that don't go by so fast
A lasting memory!

He finds it hard to be
He accepts and knows the rules
He finds it hard to see
He's been told so many lies
He understands the reasons why

Well welcome to my world
And welcome to my pain

These are the fears that last
These are the fears that won't go so fast
And become a memory
These are the years that last
These are the years that don't go by so fast
A lasting memory!

This is my world
So how can it be yours?
A reason to conquer
Always a thought
That's waiting to haunt you
Justice falls
And leaves you peacefully
And accept that it's eternally
I'm blind, but now I see
No remorse!
