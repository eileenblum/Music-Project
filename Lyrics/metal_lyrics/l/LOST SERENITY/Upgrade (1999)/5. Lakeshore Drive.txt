I'm just a traveler
Booked a flight
Took the bus
Drove the car
Far away

Did you see me
Pass you by
Buy a drink
Took a note
Far away

All I ever really wanted was some peace of mind
All I ever really wanted was this bench I see
All I ever really needed was the wind in my head

I'm just a traveler
Booked a flight
Took the bus
Drove the car
Far away

Did you see me
Pass you by
Buy a drink
Took a note
Far away

All I ever wanted was some peace of mind
All I really wanted was this bench I see
All I really needed was the wind in my head
All I really need is here

All alone at Lakeshore Drive
Watching the morning sun
All alone at Lakeshore Drive
Watching time pass by

Give me a reason
Give me one last sigh
Show me how to relate or say goodbye
Give me a reason
Give me one last sigh
Show me how to relate or say goodbye

All I really want is time
All I really want to find
All I really need is here
All I really want is time
All I really want to find
All I really need is here!

I'm just a traveler
Booked a flight
Took the bus
Drove the car
Far away

Did you see me
Pass you by
Buy a drink
Took a note
Far away

All I ever wanted was some peace of mind
All I really wanted was this bench I see
All I ever really needed was the wind in my head

All alone at Lakeshore Drive
Watching the morning sun
Watching time pass by...
