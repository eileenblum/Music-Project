It all started a long time ago
Another day, another life
When all images were black and fading
Some will say they didn't know and
And some can state it didn't show
Well I don't really care,
I keep it all inside - AH!

I've had to cross a million years
Beaten many on my way
And never needed healing
I've had to cross a million miles
Survived terror in disguise
And came to understand

I've had to cross a million years
Beaten many on my way
And never needed healing
I've had to cross a million miles
Survived terror in disguise
And came to understand

I saw myself running
And call out in need of misery
I'm in this war, all alone,
As long as I have to
I was trying to see things
I did not want to see
Lost beauty, lost decay
I'm in this war, all alone,
As long as I have to
And so I'll try again - Start the day with a storyline never heard
And so I'll die again - Trying to face that the story is true
The story too

I've had to live a million lives
Had to suppress it all inside
Never found a reason
I've had to win a million fights
Had to relive them every night
Now I understand

I've had to live a million lives
Had to suppress it all inside
Never found a reason
I've had to win a million fights
Had to relive them every night
Now I understand

I saw myself running
And call out in need of misery
I'm in this war, all alone,
As long as I have to
I was trying to see things
I did not want to see
Lost beauty, lost decay
I'm in this war, all alone,
As long as I have to
And so I'll try again - Start the day with a storyline never heard
And so I'll die again - Trying to face that the story is true
The story too

I find myself awake
Crying out to non-existing images
Waiting for my long-lost friend
Puzzled by my own reflection
Deprived of all innocent remarks
A journey into the final quarter
I must collect all the chosen memories
And finish the game again
Wake up my enemy, my friend
For reality fails
It keeps me from falling asleep
Never as one
As much as I wanted to
I want to

Freedom fails as long as I have to
Find another way to cross a frontier
Or run far away
I would find another way to cross a frontier
Or run far away
I should find another way today
Find another way to stay
Never will I ever be confronted
Never again, yeah, will I be confronted

It all started a long time ago
Another day, another life
When all images were black and fading
Some will say they didn't know
And some can state they didn't show
I don't really care,
I keep it all inside - side - side - side - side
