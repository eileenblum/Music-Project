A manifesto's been declared
The witches hammer to be heard
By those who practise heresy
Those who would change in secrecy

You have been warned
Time is to regret

It is the inquisitions law
To sort them out if they're not pure
It's not allowed another will
Those sorcerers who pretend to heal
You will confess to their reign of fear

[2x]
Make them believe
Convert the pagans
The devil's feast
Burn them!
Make them believe
Convert the pagans cleansed by fire

He was a righteous honoured man
The mayor of a German town
He was notorious on his own
As a hunter of the witches known

He would nor rest
'til his duty's done

[2x]
Make them believe
Convert the pagans
The devil's feast
Burn them!
Make them believe
Convert the pagans cleansed by fire

Cleansed by fire
Cleansed by fire

[2x]
Oremus, oremus
Oremus pro paganis
In mortem, in mortem,
Agnoscant veritatem

Cleansed by fire
They'll be cleansed by fire
They'll be cleansed by fire
They'll be cleansed by fire
