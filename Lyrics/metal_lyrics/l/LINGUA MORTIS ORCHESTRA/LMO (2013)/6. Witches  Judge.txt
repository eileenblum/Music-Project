"So confess that you're a sorceress!"
"I have never done these sins!"
"We will send you to the torture!"
"I have never done these sins!"

In the witches' tower we have chained her to the wall,
send her to the torture, her resistance was just small.
Pull the clamps much tighter and then put her to the rack!
Yes, my humble torturer, you are free to break her back.

Now you'll be sentenced by the witches' judge.
Expect no mercy, you'll be sentenced by the witches' judge.

In my house of justice rules the power of the law,
my court makes no difference between famous, rich or poor.
I am pleading guilty to the laws of church and god,
so your judgement will be decapitation by the sword.

Now you'll be sentenced by the witches' judge.
Expect no mercy, you'll be sentenced by the witches' judge.

You gotta die, so that your soul is cleansed right
from all your sins now, so that the lord will take
your sacrifice (your sacrifice)
I watch you die, so your soul may rise up
into heaven and all your blood will be
my sacrifice (my sacrifice)
