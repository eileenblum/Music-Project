I've seen her fly by night
the devil at her side.
They cursed and swore us hell and disaster.
Beware, my friends, they're coming out to get you.

Sorcery she denied
but then she made me blind.
She blew my eyes and made them all blurry,
then I could run, I've felt her depravity.

Magic powder stew, poison in the brew.

She'll bring us down, the river falls dry,
the kids become ill, the cattle will die.
I've seen her, I swear, she danced at his side.

Tonight she'll be the devil's bride
Tonight, tonight, the devil's bride

I've seen her fly by night
the devil at her side.
They cursed and swore us hell and disaster.
Beware, my friends, they're coming out to get you.

Her master at her side, she's the devil's bride.

She'll bring us down, the river falls dry,
the kids become ill, the cattle will die.
I've seen her, I swear, she danced at his side.

Tonight she'll be the devil's bride
Tonight, tonight, the devil's bride
