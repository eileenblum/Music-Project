I've seen her blood flow, as her head fell on the ground
and her sigh, I won't forget that sound.
The people around, they were scared and they all cried,
as they all bore witness how she died.

An eye for an eye and all the tears she'd cried.
It's an eye for any eye, she comes to me, now I must die
(tonight)

And then overnight it turned out that all was wrong,
that my sentence was a crying shame.
I realise now that all I believed was false,
all my errors, I'm the one to blame.

An eye for an eye and all the tears she'd cried.
It's an eye for any eye, she comes to me, now I must die
(tonight)

"Madness overcomes, you'll regret what you have done.
Haunted by my ghost, there's no place to hide, my dear,
your life, my dear, is mine I swear!"

She's coming back to take my life,
I'm sorry for all I have done to you, oh yeah...
She's coming, she's coming to take my life,
She's coming, she's coming, she takes my life.

He seemed far away, like he was focused on inside,
who could have ever read what's on his mind.
It seemed like he felt all the guilt he made alive,
a too heavy burden for his life.

An eye for an eye and all the tears she'd cried.
It's an eye for any eye, she comes to me, now I must die
(tonight)
