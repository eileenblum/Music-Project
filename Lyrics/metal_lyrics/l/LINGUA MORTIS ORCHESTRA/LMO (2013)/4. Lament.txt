Sitting in the dark,
in the tower's blackest hole.
In the dungeon's darkness,
wounded in the flesh and soul.

What have I done wrong
that they treat me all so bad?
All have left me now,
I had trust, now just regret.

Blowing in the wind,
my life's like dust in the wind.
Only my tears are left for my lament.

Waiting for an end,
for a terrifying end.
All the torture's pain,
all the laughter and the shame.

I thought she was my friend,
she betrayed me with her lie.
Though I brought her flowers,
now I'll always wonder why.

Lost, there is no hope left, this will be my end,
my hours, they have been counted now.
Lost, though I'm innocent, they all want me dead.
I'm target for their hate, I know.

Say, where is my saviour? No way I could be saved here.
Days are drowning in tears, so say, where is my saviour?
