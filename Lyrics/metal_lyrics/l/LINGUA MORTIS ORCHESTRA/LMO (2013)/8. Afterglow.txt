After so many centuries
it is not forgotten what has happened,
all this mass hysteria, all that phobia.
And what has changed about it,
are we now immune against this madness?
So much think the same, I would guess.

I can still recall the echoes of the cries
and the traces all around
fade in the afterglow.

Behind the fire's light
wait the shadows of the night,
fade in the afterglow.

Why is it that we always
try to make somebody pay for misfortune,
for our fears and for all our mistakes, we
always forget the victims,
all the legions we have sent to the slaughter,
as if life means nothing we still play god.

I can still recall the echoes of the cries
and the traces all around
fade in the afterglow.

Behind the fire's light
wait the shadows of the night,
fade in the afterglow.

Out of the darkness, back into the light
it seems we still feel their pain
after so many years there's still a memory,
maybe they died not in vain.

There, behind the fire's light...
