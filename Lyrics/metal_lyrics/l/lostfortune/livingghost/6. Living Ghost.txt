All of me is now in their hands (now in their hands)
I know longer have control
Demons have consumed me (consumed me)
They've stolen my soul (soul)

The longer I'm here, the harder it gets
I beg them every single day, but they won't let me quit
I swear I want to change, I swear I want to live
But these demons have a hold on me that doesn't forgive

Now I am a living ghost [3x]
