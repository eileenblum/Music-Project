No, hope
There's no, hope

There's no more room in the world
For people like me, so I live here in agony
Fuck

There's no more room in the world for people like me
So I live here in agony (agony)
I'm trapped inside a dead world ((dead world)

I've, come to terms, that I'm already dead
Those things, that I felt, we're not just in my head
Visions, always blurred, like fog in the night
No matter how hard I try, this will never feel right

I'm trapped inside a dead world of dead dreams
Once you get here you'll know what it means
The cold will rise up &amp; it cuts like a knife
Straight through your soul, taking your life
[2x]

Please take me first [2x]
I can't do this any longer
Please take me first
