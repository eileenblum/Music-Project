This is the walk of a dead man
Trying to live, doing everything I can
My last breathe, my last stand
This is the walk of a dead man
[2x]

I'm coming back to life all the pain is now gone
I can still feel but it all feels wrong
What's going on, what's happening to me?
Is this life really over, am I finally free?

Feels like
The first time opening my eyes
This is
The place you go when you die

Death stood above me
I realized my fate
Just to take my soul
&amp; tell me I'm too late
What?

This is the walk of a dead man
Trying to live, doing everything I can
My last breathe, my last stand
This is the walk of a dead man
[2x]

Death pulled me out of the ground
Sweeping dirt away without any sound
Feel his breathe, heavy, cold
Being brought back to life with no fucking soul
No fucking soul

Death pulled me out of the ground
Sweeping dirt away without any sound
Feel his breathe, heavy, cold
Being brought back to life with no soul

The tone I was carried was now at rest
Taken from the world at his request
Born into a life of lost fortune &amp; false hope
This must be the end of the rope [2x]

This is the walk of a dead man
Trying to live, doing everything I can
My last breathe, my last stand
This is the walk of a dead man
[2x]
