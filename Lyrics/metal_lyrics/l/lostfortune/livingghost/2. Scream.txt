They put me in the ground
When I was ready to rest for good
Dressed to impress, as they sealed me in wood
I could hear dirt dropping down bit by bit
As the shovels emptied out I tried to scream out to quit
But my body couldn't move or make any sound
So the soil piled in pound by pound
Am I dead [2x]
Or am I trapped inside my head?

It can't be over
This can't be it

Am I dead
Am I dead or trapped inside my head?
[2x]

I finally wake up
Everything is black, I can't move at all
I swear I'm fucking trapped
So I scream, I scream please tell me this is just a dream [2x]
My nails are breaking off as I try escape
Blood pouring from my fingers out onto my face
Kill me now [2x]
I can't live like this underground [2x]

So I scream, scream
Please tell me this is just a dream
[2x]
