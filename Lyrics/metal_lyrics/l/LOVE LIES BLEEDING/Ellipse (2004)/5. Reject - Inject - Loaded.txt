Between chaos and harmony
Between birth and genocide
Between them and me
"I" am nowhere

Please let me be somewhere
Please let me be someone

Here nothing remains
I am the nameless shadow
Searching for his soul

Bring me light
Give me your night
Lead me, it must be something
Bring me light
Give me your night
Lead me, there must be something

I want to live, I want to die
I just want to be at your side
But the symphony ends always to early
Without a single sigh...

Bring me light
Give me your night
Lead me, it must be something
Bring me light
Give me your night
Lead me, there must be a meaning

My skin is so alone
My body is useless

I am not, I no longer exist
Nothing is yours, nothing is mine,
You're the substance who create names
But will you understand that here,
You are pure weakness?

I am not, I'm no longer there
I am not, I'm no longer there
I am not, I'm no longer there
I am not, I'm no longer there

Bring me light
Give me your night
Lead me, it must be something
Bring me light
Give me your night
Lead me, there must be a meaning

I want to live, I want to die
I just want to be at your side
But the symphony ends always to early
Without a single sigh...
(Let me drift away)

Please let me be somewhere
Please let me be someone
Please let me be somewhere
Please let me be someone

I used to dream that I had a life
My blood is cold, cold as yours
My heart is a void full of winds
Suffering, senseless
My veins are empty waiting for you
Pleasure, senseless

I reject their fake paradise
Give me hell!
I belong to you
Let me see the colors of reality
Reject / inject / loaded

Between chaos and harmony
Between birth and genocide
Between them and me
"I" am nowhere

Let me be somewhere, nothing remains
I am the nameless shadow searching for his soul

I fall, I feel
Hail to you mighty goddess
Come to me, come in me
At last....

I fall, I feel
Surrounded by a deep black hole
I start to see
This hole of knowledge
Carries me away

I don't dream anymore
I fly over;
Over their life
You are true within me
Suffering as vector
I am real within you
Pleasure, as guide

Now i live, now I die
I'll be forever at your side
The symphony starts
As we drown in ecstasy
