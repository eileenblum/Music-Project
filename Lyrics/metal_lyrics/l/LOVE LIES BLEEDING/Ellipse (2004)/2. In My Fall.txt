Poor wine into my glass
wrath is rising
Ignore forgiveness, below gets
calling my name

Here - the fool fives's forum
Hear - the hallowed portals of my vice opening wide

Particles of wrong vibrations
Heineons inspiration
Muses kissing me words and worlds
Flowing my body with greed

Hurting myself to reach hallucinations
Kept to this world by tenuous strings
The monstrous idea of hope ejaculates moribund cocoons

I eat the flesh of my flesh
Transfiguration of horrors
I eat the flesh of my flesh
Absolutions of horrors...
To come

Slowly un-citing the motion profane to all
Waste my entrails and see the mistakes of time
Ghastly inertia - Primer complexio

Acts that remembered in the morning are futile
Chaos subjugates all memories (all is now)

In my fall I will drag you all

Particles of wrong vibrations
Heineons inspiration
Muses kissing me words and worlds
Flowing my body with greed

Now I vomit ideas stuck in my lungs
Words are but larves devouring my throat
Hideous vaginal repulsion of consciousness
Locking the industrial edge of principles.
