Pigs need masters and masters need pigs
To follow they believe is going forward
Hear me now as I bring you the hope
I will destroy your future
Erasing words that built up nations
And pigs still proud of the past
Build yourself with blood and dust
The hourglass is waiting and needs your time

I despair the horrors of horrors - birth
Abomination about all others - birth

The hourglass is waiting
The hourglass is waiting
The hourglass is waiting
The hourglass is waiting

Dead inside
Principles above all men divided
Dead inside
Sickness infecting the lunar frailty

And stars sink in the patterns logic
Undivine my sights
Blind my faith
Perverse angel, learn me the exclusive discipline of torments

Rest - lies in the hands of death
Hell's strange crest
Life's opulent ordeal
Reverse the silent ones

REVOCATION
REVOCATION
REVOCATION
REVOCATION

Dead inside
Views of inferior dwellings
Minds saturated with guilt
Narcotic narcissistic
Luminaries among the blind

The hourglass is waiting
The hourglass is waiting
The hourglass is waiting
The hourglass is waiting
