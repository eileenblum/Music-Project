The remote valley of my life was haunted by faceless shadows
Guilty of willing to live. I lost the remnants of my insouciance in the garden of grief
My contrite eyes have no more tears and my blood wishes it could run free
Funeral lamentations come to my ears...
My dark oratorio ends and with its dying echoes will I leave
Let me satiate the earth with my blood
Let fallen angels free my soul and end my penitence.
