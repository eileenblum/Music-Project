Standing alone in the deepest void of hell
Burning chaos as only reality
(bordel de breaks a la con)
Time is a thorn in your veins
Time is my knife in your flesh [x2]

There wouldn't be desire without me
For I am the axiome of your life
The principle of all will on Earth
The essence of your being

Of your life 
Dead inside/Fear me not/Sinfull grace/Eyeless soul
(whorship me) 
Hidden in your pitifull dreams
I know what you'll never know

Freedom as strong illusion
You'll never see what I see

Time is a thorn in your veins
Time is my knife in your flesh 

Evil is the seed of creation
The primal process of art
Run toward my heaven
From nowhere to beyond 

Dead inside/Fear me not/Sinfull grace/Eyeless soul
(whorship me)

Eternity has come to end
You don't deserve me
My quest is now over
Just fuckin' die alone

Deeper and deeper is the thorn in your veins
Deeper is my knife in your flesh
Stay in the sphere of your forsaken world
Drowning in emptiness

Drown in emptiness

Standing alone in the deepest void of hell
Burning chaos as only reality

Shed the tears of bitterness
Shed the blood on my feet

Oh, I see your eyes, your pain, your end

I remain the only God on earth
After the holocaust of thoughts
Desire invade everything
But you're not here anymore to see

Dead inside/Fear me not/Sinfull grace/Eyeless soul
(whorship me)
