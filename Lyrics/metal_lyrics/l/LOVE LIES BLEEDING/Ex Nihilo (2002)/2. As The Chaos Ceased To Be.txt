Welcome in a world of morality
Of valours, of joy, of love,
But there is no life

As chaos ceased to be, life desapeared
Waves of existence invade our tranquility
As chaos ceased to be, death becomes real
Present denied, we fall into history

There . is no life

Post-human race
Nihilism
Putrid feelings
You shall reign on earth . without me

Protect the strong
Against the weak
Your shamefull heart
Will always beat

Now it's to late you're alive
Your poisonous life enthroned our existence 

As chaos ceased to be, life desapeared
Waves of existence invade our tranquility
As chaos ceased to be, death becomes real
Present denied, we fall into history

As chaos ceased to be, life desapeared
Waves of existence invade our tranquility
As chaos ceased to be, death becomes real
Present denied, we fall into history

Welcome in a world of morality
Of valours, of joy, of love,
But there is no life

Let the gracefull andante saves us all
Let me die in harmony

Listen to the soteriological melody 
And die in harmony

Die in harmony
