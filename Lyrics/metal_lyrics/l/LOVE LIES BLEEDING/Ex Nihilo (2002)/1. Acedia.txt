In the distance I hear the laments of a soul
The chant of emptiness, the song of perdition
Waiting for a sign, waiting for a light I stand in darkness
Waiting for a sign, waiting for a light I - drown - in - me 

I fall alone in the eyes of fate, Acedia
I rip my skin, I burn my flesh, Acedia
Nothing is real, nothing is real, Acedia
Acedia

Hold the knife of lies and take my feeble hand
My heart belongs to you until eternity's end
Hold the knife of lies

Come to me, there is no hope
Why did you forsaken me? I'm cold inside
Come to me, there is no hope
Why did you forsaken me? I'm frozen

But all I can see is a pale empty shadow,
A scream from the past, without reality

Your heaven is a ghost, my flesh is real
Your angels are falling
My blood is your doom

I've seen your face despaired and crying
All alone
My blood is your doom

My nameless quest is a sin if his light is real
But there is no hope of redemption

Now your will of power has come to end
My redemption is in me (lies within myself)
