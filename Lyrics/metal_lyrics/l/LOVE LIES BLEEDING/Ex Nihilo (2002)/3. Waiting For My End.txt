I see through a veil, a mirror for the light
And my cells fail once again
Words lose their meaning
And become annoying sounds
Bells of pain, that rapture my innocence
Angels in disguise
Start to weave my skin
And smile with disgust
And wait for me to end it all

I once dreamt of god.
Almighty among us
Watching us die 
Begging for mercy 
Watching our suffering
And pleased by our pain
A grand theology bizarre
That drives me from my faith
And casts such a sweet poison divine
Worms inside my veins
Conceeding my every doubts
To a weakening and dying self 

And now that I take his throne
Crowned with thorns
Dying like the son
and eternal as I.
I order the world to consume us all 

Angels disolve in the air around
Biting and kissing the sweetest parts of me

Let the flesh be blessed by anger
Religious suicide into a world of reality
Let the flesh be blessed by anger
And winds are waiting for my end

Raising the stigmatas to the vaults
I make the blood fall into the chalice
As filthy monks around sing my name
And splendours of values unnaturals
Drink now from the potion made poison
Of the ill veins that chain my soul
And feel the absurdity of words themselves
Refusing to combine and follow my cursed will

The pulse of damnation slowly resounds
The goals of insanity reveal themselves
If I am to die, all will follow me
If I am to live, all will die for my glory
All will die! 

And the young raped virgin will crown me with despair
And set upon each of my heads the names forgotten
Whose very meanings now extrude from every letter
Sounds that break the steel and mark the flesh with all my sins
I carry universality within my destiny
For I am the snake that speaks freely to all
