Time has come, my son
To open your eyes 
To watch your last dawn 
To leave your peacefull dreams behind 

The deepest silence, as only guide
We have to walk toward the wall
Of your destiny 

The stone of your last breath
Try not to understand 
The very essence of my will 
You'll never hear the voice I hear 
You'll never feel the purity of my sphere 

Ton monde n'est plus le miens. EmpoisonnÃ© par une intempestive luciditÃ©, 
je ne ressens plus que crainte et tremblements

I only see pure innocence
I am alone, linked to the words of god 

Take my life, don't weep a tear
I am yours and my soul will remain in your heart 

The clearness of the sun is paler than the moon 
I have to shed the blood of my son 
The clearness of the sun is paler than the moon
The flame in my eyes slowly fades away 

The darkness in my heart is colder than the night 
I have to hold my knife 
The darkness in my heart is colder than the night
I have to take his life 

Lonelyness in my life is stronger than the steel
I have to obey cause
I belong to him Lonelyness in my life is stronger than the steel 
I am the only one, hearing his voice

Bend your head, don't say a word 
Forgive me son, my faith cant' be broken

I bend my head, I don't say a word
I forgive you father 
Your faith causes my end 

Fear, grief, shame 
I deny the words of god

Fear grief, death 
You won't kill me, father

Ah ! The steel in my heart 
Ã ! My blood is running 

Time has come father 
To close your eyes
To watch your last dusk
To leave your pitifull dreams behind

I am not your son 
I tasted the serpent's kiss
I laught at your corpse
I'll spit at your feet 

My eyes, wide open, 
Behold this vain sacrifice 
I reject your repugnant love 
Love perverted by Him
