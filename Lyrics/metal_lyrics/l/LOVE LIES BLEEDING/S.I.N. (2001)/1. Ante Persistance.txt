L'espace vide laisse place au nÃ©ant le plus infertile. 
Il ne reste rien de nos espoirs de salut.
Ce grondement est celui du rien:
bruit sourd d'une stÃ©rilitÃ© dÃ©finitive... 
A la limite du pire, d'un bonheur intolÃ©rable... 
Eros s'Ã©loigne et pourtant je sens encore sa prÃ©sence. 
The breath of life seems so far away no more illusion, 
I have to see the face of emptyness,
the colour of chaos Passionless visions of pure destruction 

Believe in me

This plague, loveless, complete nihilism closes the gate of time

believe in me 

End of time
End of light 
Pleasure and suffering become putrefied dreams
I feel no more the caress of life 

Le silence perdure dans son emprise Ã©goiste et pourtant je crois dicerner un faible soupir 

My eyes need a new substance 
My ears reject their lethargy 
Blood have to run again 
Blood have to run again 

I'm nothing but I feel the spirit of the being
I'm nothing but hope embraces my bones 

The caress of the light, the end of the night
I'm waiting for the dawn Believe in me 

His hands are trembling, his will is pure weakness Fire has to be set 

believe in me 

May they stay in their abyss waiting for their existence
Pathetic souls and regrets
I laught as they fall I don't believe in him And I just believe in me 
Ante persistence, something is near 
Despite its absence
It's allready there 
ante persistence, something is near
