From dawn to morn she rides
Goalless in the nightsky
Poor shadow holding a scythe
Ripping heads endlessly 
Remembering not the beginning of it 
She rides on and on..

Time itself needed to forget
The blood that was spilled 
Time itself needed to forget 
The tears that were lost 

I take the forlorn path
Death follows on my shade 
I Find the sole place
Night surrounds me now 

And I hear her coming
She follows behind
And hungers for my soul and she thirsts for my blood 

And there falling and swirling to the pulse of the night
Here in the darkest of night far from god and men's sight 
I fell to her strike to rejoin those who depart 
By their own hands 
To escape from the heavenly torpor And the reign of the slain innocents 

Keep me aware 
Keep me alive 
Burning flames
Pain reveals the flesh
Enlightens my soul 

And from now on
I roam on her trail 
As idle as ice 
As silent as the wind
Even hell is now forbiodden to me
Its gates were locked by my death

Come and ride with us in the night
She longs for you
Now you're the devil's own 
Even hell is now forbiodden to us
Its gates were locked down by our mistress
