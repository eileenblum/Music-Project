Far before time
Started to doom us all
Water could melt steel.
From a sun the darkness.

Oh... Gods of death and hate 
Oh.. Inner sight of a great evil 

I, from the breed of the Wolf, shall throne supreme

The kindred of the howling 
Demon shape of the eldest essence
Once asleep, now grasping the ground
The past is made of flesh and blood

" Far beyond the stars lays a throne
Where I know you are resting father 
A place for all the brave dead in battle
And that from there you are watching the struggle

Over and over the battles starts 
Never ending never resting 
To win one day now is an inner loss 
Allow me to die, let my flesh fall down 

Cut the strings that keep me standing 
Let my soul be freed from glory

An inner doom brings a savior to all
And the gods are laughing now. 

Why should I understand ?
Do the gods need us to play again ?
They make me pay for my doubts and strikes at them
They need us for their show " 

" From far beyond the stars I stand 
And watch upon you with pride and pain
I too can now see death, blood, and misery
The gods need you more than they understand themselves
Infinity has its own limits within it 
The gods almighty will is man's own one 
There is no truth, no salvation 
And this is why you can strike at the sun. "
