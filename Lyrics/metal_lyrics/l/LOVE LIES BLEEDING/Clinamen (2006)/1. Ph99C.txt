Spirits out of their unconsciousness
Attracted to the heavenly axis
Lunatic theogony
The gods of Atlas have abandoned

Atlas letting muons loose
Man snake lion horns
Celestial revolution
Orphic cosmogony

Born from the stars
Born from the ashes
Vertuous flight
On wings of crime

Our life is a descent from the highest stars
Orion! See without eyes!
Nothing but pure light
Orion! See without eyes!
Nothing but pure light to see there only darkness

Desillusion is what makes anegel live on
Auto Katasterismoi
In times to come
Eternity alone
That's what the philosopher saw for you

See my heliacal rising when the earth rapes the sky
Born from the piss and the pit
I walk upon water when the moon hides the sun
Born from the piss and the pit

Desillusion is what makes anegel live on
Auto Katasterismoi
In times to come
Eternity alone
That's what the philosopher saw for you

Oh Orion
Oceans of blackness
Oh Orion
Eyes that stared at vice

No fight can ever be won
Battles are always lost
Why then trying to stare at the sun?
Tell yourself only lies
You always fall lower
Ever wondered why the blind turns his eyes to mars?

I'll be the first to stare at the sun
I'll blind my eyes to see behind mars

Holy darkness, hiding the blind abyss monster
Whose skin is white and untouched by the sun
Crawling in patience and faith, waiting for the light
To burn it's eyes and devour all meaning

The while snake will rise from the dark
And hunt those without the original sense

This is the punishent we were programmed for
In faith is the struggle for sight
The holy deception, the holy retribution
In faith is the struggle for sight

Angel of light I have failed
I did open my eyes
Orion, Orion, what has been done?

The whole truck is easy, let you see in a blink
And you'll want to see it again
Illumination, disillusion
Addicted to light, the junkie fool of the gods

Our life is a descent from the highest stars
Orion! See without eyes!
Nothing but pure light to see there only darkness
