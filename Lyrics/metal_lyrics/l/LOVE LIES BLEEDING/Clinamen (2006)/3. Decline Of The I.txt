Heaven's decline
Sounds based on silence
We have been hiding forever
We were all meant to die
Inside the course of time
A grab of a few seconds for a feeling of eternity

It's all about nothingness
History is about failure
An instant, a failure, it's all we'll remember

...into the shape of memories
...the present always seems faded

Decline of the I

Kill yourself in my name
A god lives within me
He shall rise you back
From the depth of my mind

Life's a bit tricky
No one really cares you know
And when the forgotten
I /I
As shadows haunt our last years
Memento
The treasons and wastes
I did not forgor anything

Mourn not my name
For you have never known me
What lies beneath the grave
Has never walked the heavens
Lies have faded life
That sun never rises twice
A spirit that cares not flowers
And that you have never even touched

The beauty of horrors that few can hold
Might fade away but never dies
In horror of casuality
The human struggle is vain

We all drift away
We make our own regrets
Remember you killed yourself
You're the only one to blame

I was just the gun
I was just the instant
I was the answer
I was the end of all

I am the noise you'll never forget
I am the silence you'll try to forget
Come come come in my hands
I have the answers to all your questions

What makes you hesitate?
What makes you uncertain?

It's only a question of faith
A spark that makes the act eternal

The highest you dream of
The highest you fall from

In your eyes I see the lack of faith
I see you look at other eyes
Another name has been called
Another card from the hat of god

Left alone after the call of god
Twelve disciples
Two beloved of god
Now it's too late
