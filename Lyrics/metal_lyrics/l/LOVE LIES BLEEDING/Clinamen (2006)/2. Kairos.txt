Enemies of time
Keepers of pain
We're your poison
Sick sick sick

No prayer
No remedy
Will delete us
Sick sick sick

Kairos

It's too early
Or it's too late
You feel the effect
Sick sick sick

The fever starts
Your body burns
Your flesh freezes
Sick sick sick

Kairos

You... see...

You see it
Through my eyes

You see it
Through my eyes

Enemies of time
Keepers of pain
We're your poison
Sick sick sick

No prayer
No remedy
Will delete us
Sick sick sick

Desease
Desire
Fever is your only god
That leads you to us

That leads you to us

You... see...
You see it
Through my eyes

Kairos
Kairos
Now it's too late
Kairos
It's too early
Kairos
It's the moment
Kairos
Of eternity

Kairos

Enemies of time
Keepers of pain
We're your poison
Sick sick sick

No prayer
No remedy
Will delete us
Sick sick sick
