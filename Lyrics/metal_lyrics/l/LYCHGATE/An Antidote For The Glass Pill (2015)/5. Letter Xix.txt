Through the eyes of insanity, youâll see the world for what it is:
A prison! An invisible net â a wolfâs trap set long ago

Each actor alone
Each by time â the perfect operator of punishment
With only a script, a silent mouth and an imploding force

With every swing of the pendulum carries some fatal hour

Each actor alone
Each by time â the perfect operator of punishment
With only a script, a silent mouth and an imploding force

Minutes lapse within a table of hours
The powers of the insane and the wicked
Can be directed against their fellow creatures or themselves
The horror of this waiting points to the falling cityâ¦
(Walls and towers saw through the emptiness)

Cylindrical spirals of rays 
Mirror cyclic recursion
I am locked in an upward gaze
The vision rotates
Inexorable...
