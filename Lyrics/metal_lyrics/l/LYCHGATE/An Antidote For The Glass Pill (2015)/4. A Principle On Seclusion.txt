Seclusion and ignorance from the world of questions
An architectâs last fragment of hope
Through the spatial utility for constant vision
Can the primordial laws be re-written?

Mankindâs affinity with an ultimate desire
Born dead before it breathes
Without its umbilical cord
Destinyâ¦ destinyâ¦ destinyâ¦

The Panopticon could spawn a new race 
Within the confines of a new construction
With powerlessness perpetuated
Fate without accident is impossible
Destiny from knowledge is unattainable

For each desire in the name progressionâ¦
For each alterationâ¦
Yields another error for the greater equation

Through the spatial utility for constant vision
Can the primordial laws be re-written?

Mankindâs affinity with an ultimate desire
Born dead before it breathes
Without its umbilical cord
Human destinyâ¦
