A legacy is reborn
An invisible power sown
Like Genghis Khan resurrected
Thus, a great lava flow closes in
Upon an island, melting
Upon lessening lands, retreatingâ¦
A perfect time for infection: euthanasia

By their will spreads the first anomaly - now a disease
Erasmus K. â help us â can we swallow the pill named Davamesque B2?

The individual - suppressed
Future intuition - to perish
An army of automatons - to roam
A living death
= Total mechanisation

By their will spreads the first anomaly - now a disease
Erasmus K. â help us â can we swallow the pill named Davamesque B2?

The million footed Leviathan named OneState
I see armies spreading beyond vastest perception 
(A horizon outside comprehensionâ¦
I cannot analyse the pain ripping through me as I watch it)
So I bow to my own execution 
And present my neck to the blade which finishes me

The individual expires 
So slowly
So imperceptibly
That the great mass feels no pain

Listenâ¦ theyâre approachingâ¦
(Theyâre coming for me now)
Goâ¦
