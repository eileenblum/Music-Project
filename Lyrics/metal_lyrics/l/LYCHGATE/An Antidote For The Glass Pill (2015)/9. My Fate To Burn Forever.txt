The truth (the Panopticon) is a mirror of the universe
Thus, we are prisoners at every scale, like recursion

Our very own cipher
To behold and cherish
Till death do us part

The truth (the Panopticon) is a mirror of the universe
Thus, we are prisoners at every scale, like recursion

Caught in an ineffable cosmos; a circle
Where revolutions are infinite
And utopia equals delusion by all laws
I cannot explain our flaws within this geometric perfection

My fate is to the inner punitive divisionâ¦ foreverâ¦

Never again was I to blend into the precise mechanical rhythm
Never to sail on the serene, mirror-like sea
Within accelerating multiplication
Within apparent infinityâ¦
(Where the structure of reality is the square root of minus 1)
To burn!
To burn!
