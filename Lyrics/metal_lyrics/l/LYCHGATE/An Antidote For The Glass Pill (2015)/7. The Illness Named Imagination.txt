The purpose of existence 
Seems to have been reduced 
To the most distant vanishing point 
On an endless horizon

At the mercy of your closest enemy: imagination.
Question marks writhe like worms
Striking the soul deeper
Turning its edges into splinters

I am the real one - I am not him â I am not We
OneState will vanish

I am the real one - I am not him â I am not We
I think, therefore I am

(The human in the menagerie diminishes like its former animals
What then becomes of man through extraction and reduction?
Mankind, the worst beast, has no place in the PhalanstÃ¨re
Live with your century but do not be its creature)

This is the fever
In the pons Varolii
Exposed to three doses
And you are cured
