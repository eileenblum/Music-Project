(A perfect eye that nothing escapes
Towards which all gazes are turned)

Here, the eye of providence
Reigns like the holy trinity
Here, the hidden eye of God
Directs the lantern's rays
Against my cell and mind

Here, the empty triangle
Calls to the human spectacle
Here, the omnipotent gaze
Commands unceasing fear

Shaking and frail
Weightless and floating
Blood flowing inwards
Away from the outside world

My heart races faster
The key turns no longer
Voices call me away
From the outside world
