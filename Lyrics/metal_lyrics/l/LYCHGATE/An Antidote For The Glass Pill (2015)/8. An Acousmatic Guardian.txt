I cannot escape my shadow
My double speaks in whispers
(Tunnelling underneath me
Beckoning me to follow)

Behind the curtain â like the Pythagorean Order
Speaks the master â decreed from above
Cast upon sails hoisted
Cast upon soldiers raised

By the power that seizes the human
By the power that breaks the soulâ¦
Inâ¦ toâ¦ false hope

I am frozen to silence by a policy of terror
A treeâs roots bolted to concrete

The ear of Dionysiusâ¦
A principle is inverted
My every word and thought is cast upon a map
(A pliant voice is heard like a slashing whip)
Lurking but shapeless, invisible but staring

By the power that seizes the human
By the power that breaks the soulâ¦
Inâ¦ toâ¦ the broken sacrifice
