Ode to the ship of fools!
Das Narrenschiff!

This is the paradigm of our time
And how we must pity a new soul born unto this world
To join the universal guild of ultimate paradox

To be marginalised into silence
A world devoid of expression

Chained to the ship of paradox
Scraping the seabed like an anchor
Wishing staunchly to free itself
Cutting and defiling the hull with all strength

Fighting the arms of the human winch
In all incessant restlessness one cannot escape
A slave to the paradoxical guild

In an anthem to this modern world
We vomit upon the rudder of imposed destiny

A remnant of hope that our shackles will one day snap in two
Ode to the demise of the paradoxical guild!
