The fire of youth inspires boundless, profound expression.
At times this expression exceeds logical magnitude.

Hatred can be so incessant that one will not tire of it;
Like a man who makes it his lifeâs work to succeed
In creating what his vision casts in stone for years ahead

But one day this life long struggle with adversity presents
Itself to that once youthful man
Who can now only see
the ludicrous angles of it.

(Sinking into a slumber and exhausted state this manâs
Passion is now the embers, not the fire)
And the apex of blindness in absolutism
Turns into a linear hue.
As the embers fade and part of the psyche gradually
Turn to ashes, the moribund purgatory
Of anticipation presents itself.
When all the embers are grey, the candle is blown out.
A life of scorn can scourge no more.
