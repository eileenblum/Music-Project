When I was young I could not understand why the body
Of a bitter man had become withered in sourness.

But then I watched my eyes freeze over like a lake during
The culmination of reminiscence over
The entire course of
my years of knowing.

Should I therefore smile in the face of meaninglessness?
For those that are fearful of the hidden
Those blind and blessed with an absence of intuition
Who sadly cannot explain their purpose

I can then do nothing in this world
For instead I am seemingly free now within open prison bars
