The Sun completes around one more
All I do is starring at the door
Like a little child I clean to miracles
That will never come true

'Cos you've gone forever...
Another day without your smile
This empty space you left behind
I wish I could forget you
with every bit part of my life

I've never thought that left
can hurt so much
that I couldn't ... you go
But it seems I see you everywhere I go (where I go)

I've confused I'm feeling in complete now
That you take away a part of me
Oh, I've tried to fight that feelings
Oh no, no, no

Just as ever let's be
Another day without your smile
This empty space you left behind
I wish I could forget you
with every bit part of my life

Another day without your smile
This empty space you left behind
I wish I could forget you
with every bit part of my life

Why did you go? (Why did you go?)
Why did you leave me (Why did you leave me)
Oh, please, come home (Oh, please, come home)

I can't survive
I won't survive
without you
I can't survive without you
