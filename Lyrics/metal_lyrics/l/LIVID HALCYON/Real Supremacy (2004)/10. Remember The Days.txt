All the flowers lost their beauty
All the flowers lost their smell
And the sun is not so bright it was shining not long ago
And I feel the emptiness
Deep inside my heart
Oh I know that itâs over now
But Iâm not able to understand
Remember the days when we were flying
We were flying with the wind
Remember the days when you said Iâll be
Iâll be ever there for you
You were the best thing that could ever happen to me
But I never let you feel this
So strong is now the pain
Oh ny hope has gone away and I donât know how to get it back again
Yes I know that itâs over now but Iâm not able to understand
Oh I never asked what you feel
Only interested in the way I feel
Now It canât be over now there were to many lovely things
Remember the days when our love was stronger
Our love was stronger than the pain
Remember the days when our love was stronger
Than the pain
Remember the days when our love was stronger
Our love was stronger than the pain
Remember the days when our love was stronger
Than the pain
Oh I never asked what you feel
Only interested in the way I feel
Now It canât be over now there were to many lovely things
Remember the days when we were flying
We were flying with the wind
Remember the days when you said Iâll be
