Close your mind, hide inside 
X-ray skies necrotize 
Time is mine the seeing-eye 
Scans 
Scans

Break through your new path 
Constructing DNA 
Forging false future 
Your truth is a plague 
Enter outer vortex 
Fall onto bended knee 
They'll fill our minds 
With the lies that we seek 

Piss-filled cavity 
Crush the head of humanity 
Stealing the light from the sky 

Fire in the void 
No pain I miss 
No outer escape 
Stay put us pigs 
Whatever we choose 
Fallen back into wombs 
No outer escape 
Stay put us pigs 
Enslavement to those 
Who know what is best 
Close your mind, hide inside 
Seeing-eye breaks the light
