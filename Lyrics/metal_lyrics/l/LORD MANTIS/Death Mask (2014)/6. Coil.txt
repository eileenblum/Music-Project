Missing the point of my
Remaining days

What I know wonât 
Be undone

In any due time or 
In any place

Whateverâs held close
Or has all gone to a loss

A learned distraction
Became disease

An intrusion, the virus
Hold more truth 
Than any action

One intention

One intention

One intention

One intention
