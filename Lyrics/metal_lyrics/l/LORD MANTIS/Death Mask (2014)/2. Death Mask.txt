Enter the crease
Exits claim your anatomy

Seething natural scent 
To resist is to fracture
And that this is the part
Of you that this allows

To the entry point
Conjoined eternal 
The true allure
Is the pleasing noise
The last gasp

Run in reverse 
Cruel colossal works 
To the widows will
Dead hand in life
To accept
Is to tie the noose
Till the moment it leaves 
The body wrecked
Seize and Resurrect 

Never ending in my mind 
This crawls into the depths 
Pulsing in my blood
Taste is buried inside
I see all fucking life in
Flame and thatâs what 
Carries me on

The body the waste
The body is waste

Paint panting clean and raw
Eliminate function your
Reason is loss impatience
Of the wounded in a blank 
Gaze finding a final match
Fish hooked like you
Compulsions kill in time
The choice myth or a 
Death mask the choice
Myth or a death mask

Death mask
