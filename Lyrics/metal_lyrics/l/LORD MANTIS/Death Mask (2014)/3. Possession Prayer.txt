Blood rust incinerate

A common threat 
Your shit intent
A cold truth to bear
The sick will ride in
The sick will ride in
Like a hammer through my soul
Like a hammer through my soul
Itâs not in front of me 
Itâs not in front of me
But sewn into my throat

My dreams will end in rust
My life will end in blood

Blood rust incinerate

Possession prayer 
To take me
A prayer for control
A prayer to disappear
Pray to disappear
Control
Control
Thatâs not my own
