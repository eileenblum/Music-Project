Scrape beyond
Deceiving flesh 
This is my last
Death laying
On a bed white sheet
With holes in my hand

Enslave endure disrupt

Cut me into nothing
Cut me into the coil
Curse me to survival 
Curse me to this coil

My life for an escape
As human as a rat

The weight of it breaks 
And gives way to my guilt
Now youâre faced with 
Three crosses

Enslave endure
