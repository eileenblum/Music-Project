Take it apart
It takes me apart
Itâs not by flesh Iâm 
Bound to you
I can take it all in if
You can take it all in too
Itâs all in now now now

Donât act like this comes 
Involuntarily
You know what I am doing
I beg to reconsider
Promise me

Cope like a corpse

How weak of me 
To supplicate
Lost in the power
Of apologies

Now within this
Forced birth 
To relocate before now 
The moment â copes
Like a - corpse
The cursed now
Copes like a corpse

Even in hell
Even hell
Surrender to its past 

Reconsider her her her 
Fucked by the goat now
Become 

Strengthened by rejection
Survival redefining scum
Depreciate judgment
Unlike complete isolation

Even in hell
Even hell
Surrenders to its past

Even in hell
Even hell
Surrenders

Even in hell
