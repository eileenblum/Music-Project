(God) Thy kingdom is putrid in every space 
I - mouth by which you feed 
Blood fuels gnashing teeth 
Praying for death 

My monstrosity, prey 
Souls fearing to see life obliterate 
Consumed with hate 
Souls fearing to see 

I - mouth by which you feed 
Blood fuels gnashing teeth 
Fearing to see 
My monstrosity drunk 

That's born of me - bile 
Puke into being vile divinity 
From corruption force 
Maggots writhe under the weight of misery 

The only shelter for the myriads of divine offspring 
The sinister mass coagulates into a snake 
Transcendence only grants greater hate 
Monumental spiritual descension 

Drunk on the ashes of destruction 
Collapsing all dimensions into oblivion 
Divine self-dissection 
Sadistic grin 

Split open skin 
Draining filth into 
A malestrom of ever deepening anguish 
Gaping heart wound 

Emiting God I have seen your monument 
For it is all around me 
The madness and ferocity 
The exact reflection of me
