A beginning unlike unrest 
If we slave 
An even end or froth 
At the mouth 

We slave our hands 
Our brains our spines 
Spineless prayer perverse 
Force and vision 

Don't skew me I'm so prone 
In a shadow my focus 
My shadow it belongs to you 
My blood, you my beloved 

Now cursed and (un)even 
That taste seems old 
Or a triumph of infection 
I'd say I'm guilty 

Of corruption 
On this less than silly gesture 
Not a world 
Not in part 

But entirely the lust 
Thrust itself 
Our hands our brains our spines 
We this collective 

Crowning conscious endeavor achievement 
My internal strife 
Manufactured cancer 
Abuses physically 

Upon my body 
Abuses mentally 
Without any forecast 
Or result consequence 

Only impulse 
And you ask me to be a man 
Only a monkey can defend a man 
Only a monkey can defend a man
