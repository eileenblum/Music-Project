The moon steers me 
Across the sea 
Winds howl at me 
Death's mockery 

Heavens drag me 
Through winter's dream 
At night I rest 
In withered sleep 

Transverse the seas 
Over the depths of the starless abyss 
To drown under her waves 
Is to feel only emptiness 

The moon steers me 
Across the sea 
Winds howl at me 
Death's mockery 

Life sickens me 
Inflamed instinct 
Inside I bleed 
My flesh I eat 

How long have I breathed 
This air of stifling unrest?? 
Should I cease to breathe 
And fall into her stillness??
