Trapped inside the need 
Inside let's encourage this 
Not so, not to speak of 
I was born to you 

You were born to me 
I deserve my desire 
That face, the face of deception 
So unhinged like raw power 

My good girl 
My baby (swine) 
Nothing ever 
Nothing always 

Always nothing 
Forever always 
So this leak 
Is mutual - an obsession 

All terror denial 
Only this my idea 
Of transference only sucking and fucking 
Your end is the result of now
