I deny my life 
Born from shit 
A life of flies 
I decide who dies 

My existence is blood 
Hold a grudge 
Fight me, I want you 
In the dark 

I found my existence in hate 
Failure is drawn to you 
In the sediment of self decay 
Fail - I want you to 

Weakness envelopes your life 
In line with the dead you lie 
Hear your calls 
The real is unreal 

In new light I found 
New existence in death 
Frozen, possessed 
Permanent dysphoria 

They come to tear your severed head in devil's blood 
Your dreams have brought them shattering your inner self 
I smell your pussy crying, little girl 
And at your weakest I'm coming to tear you down
