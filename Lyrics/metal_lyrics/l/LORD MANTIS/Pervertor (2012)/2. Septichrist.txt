Purity is the seas 
Flooded with rotting flesh 
A million stars begin to bleed 
Terror equipped 

Flesh induced trip 
Sinister sex 
Into the sacred glands 
Believe in nothing 

Violent cumming 
Soul regurgitates 
Hollow sockets 
Remain vacant as I descend 

Circle of shit 
Fall into the unseen womb 
I am distrust 
Reborn from fate 

An ancient hell 
Chained to myself 
Lowered into 
My own hate 

Residue of abscessed fate 
Thrown upon hell's front gate 
Abandon all hope 
For life has left you 

Onwards to wastelands 
Barren of God's plans 
Afterbirth plume 
Of destroyed womb 

Rises to lead 
A suffocating fume 
Life fades swiftly 
Leaves me empty 

All aboard into nothingness 
Entombed, don't bother to exhume 
The divine presence of fallen faiths 
Aspect of an almighty you dare not face
