[SODOM cover version]

Black metal is the game I play
Cause no one shows me
The right way
I'm bloody antichrist
Only believe in bad
Spit at the church evil I get
Blasphemer!

[Refrain]
Rites of death return to hell
I'm Satan's child: attack with spell

I turn the cross upside down
And read the satanic bible
With a fuckin groan
My life begins at midnight twelve
Masturbate and kill myself
Blasphemer!

[Refrain]

I love to drink my own blood
My sin is my life
In the war agains God
I talk to demons night tonight
Make fuck and black masses
For eternal life
Blasphemer!

[Refrain]

Blasphemer!
