Satanic rites
Come with the force of evil
Sacrifice! Sacrifice! 
Your worthless soul
Master of the damned
Forever blessed in fire
Crucified bastard!
The lord of light has been suffocated

Forgotten worlds
Their power swarms around me
Lucifer! Lucifer! Lucifer!
His pride's descended from darkness
Feeling of His hands
Like Phoenix's touch of fire
Demigod! Satan!
He chose to take this life of sin

Satanic rites
Come with the force of evil
Sacrifice! Sacrifice! 
Your worthless soul
Master of the damned
Forever blessed in fire
Crucified bastard!
The lord of light has been suffocated
