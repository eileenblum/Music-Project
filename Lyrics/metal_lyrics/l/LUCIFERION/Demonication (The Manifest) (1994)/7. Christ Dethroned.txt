Fear My name
Bastard child
Step aside
My realm has come
The sea of lies
Is flooding all
And son of God
Will never rise again

Hear My words
In the dawn of doom
I'm the son of Him
The king of all
I'm the fallen one
The Christians' plague
Believe in Me
I bless your soul with sin

Suffering!
Christ suffer
Godborn in the sea of blood
Burn in Me!
I'm burning 
In flames your sins condemned
