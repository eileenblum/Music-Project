Rise from darkness
From the land of eternity
All I left behind
With tears in my eyes
Land of malevolent gods
Revelation into another time
I am the voyager
Let me make you victorious

[Refrain]
Fly away to the dark skies
With no end
To the place where the souls
Will rise again
Troops of darkness are
Coming from the seas
They will reign again
In blasphemy!!!

Ride the stormwind
Through the fields
Of an unholy war
All I see remaining
Are the spirits of the damned
Rows of crucified ones
Cover miles of this magic ground
Lakes of fire
Feel the wrath of the demigod

[Refrain]

Rise from darkness
From the land of eternity
All I left behind
With tears in my eyes
Land of malevolent gods
Revelation into another time
I am the voyager
Let me make you victorious
