Wrath of gods, it fills my mind
Like a stream of blood fills the pits of hell
The gates of sin are open wide
So feel my fist upon your soul!

[Refrain]
Here my prayer
Master!
Bless my world
Invisible!

See his eyes in the dawn of death
In the sea of fire He rises his hands
Drag my soul into the Neverland
Where the son of God will never rise

Open the gates of the invisible world
Legions of darkness are rising again
My only vision - sorrow and death
Oceans of fire flooding the earth

I'm the lord of sin
Born of wrath and grief
Primus of the gods
King of rats and flies
Curse the opposites
Destroy my enemies
Hang them upon the cross
To the end with the holy ghost
