Through the gates I cast my spell
My soul: forever lost
As I fly over those mystic lands
My grace flows over all

All the ancient gods
Will speak my name in pride
For now I have risen
Against this christian world

In the name of sin
I swear and give my word
My kingdom will come again
And the realm of God will fall

On the wind I spread my wings
My call: reaching the stars
All you ancient gods
I'm the one
King of the world
