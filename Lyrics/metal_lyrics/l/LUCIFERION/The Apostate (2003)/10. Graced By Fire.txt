Wings of fire, blinding eyes
He comes for me
Through the sky I see him falling
Surrounded by his faithful
On the bridge of endless time
He's treading on his hate
Cast away
From the realm of God
He chose to reign on earth

Damned to hell
Born through hate
Graced by fire

His face has been burned
By the rising sun
It's the wrath of God
Mystic powers calling him
His heart is full of darkness
Lake of fire in my eyes
I burn inside
See the visions of the past
Flashing in my mind

Damned to hell
Born through hate
Graced by fire

Evil never seen
Paradise never earned
Hidden for human senses
Not mine!
