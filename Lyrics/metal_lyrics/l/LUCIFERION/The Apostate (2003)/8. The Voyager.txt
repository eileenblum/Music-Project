Revenant from another world
From the land of no return
Sacrifice - supposition to live
Screams of thousand skies
Sodomic immortality
Cursed to burn in blasphemy
Sovereign of the legions of death
Evil God: You'll rise

Desecrator!, Agitator!

Twisted mind like an evil flow
Answers will we never know
Evil gods have forgotten my name
Soon it's time to rise
Necrosanct from another world
Give to me the key of pain
Let me climb the stairs of doom
Reach a thousand skies

Desecrator!, Agitator!

Through the gates like snakes they slither
Through the vaults like a wind they blow
When Son of fire is falling from the sky
My force of evil follows me
When heaven stands in flames
And a lake of fire comes into my eyes

The circle is complete
And demons bend for me
Through the power of the gods
Son of the flames arise!
