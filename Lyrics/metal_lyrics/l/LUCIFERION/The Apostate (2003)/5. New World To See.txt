Opened eyes, but still they cannot see
In their life only hunger burns free
State the prize and the morals will bend
Pull a string and the reason shall end

Wakened by the sin
Visions dawned in me
Burning in my wrath
Spit on rotten way

Stricken will of men
By the weakness blessed
Cripple-minded race
Blind and overwhelmed

Will! Will! Will! Will!
New world to see

Be aware all you purified ones
They aspire to disorder your mind
Breed a thought and the others will breed
Sling a stone and the others shall sling

Honour your pain, embrace your fantasy
Trust inner eyes, through waste they'll lead the way
Sail one the wave that bring your self towards perfection
And life'll let you see

Honour your pain, embrace your fantasy
Trust inner eyes, through waste they'll lead the way
Sail on the wave that bring your self towards perfection
And life'll bend for thee

Honour your pain, embrace your fantasy
Trust inner eyes, through waste they'll lead the way
Sail on the wave that bring your self towards perfection
And life'll serve you forever
