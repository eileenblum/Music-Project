Pray for me not you weakest of men
In the name of blindness you're blessed

Sense corriding guilt you once planted in me
To control my will, force me on  knees
Pure in my heart, strong in my mind
Forced submission failed and i'm now destroying by will
Now, destroying by will

That crawling vermin
Our primal true, old enemy
Our thoughts are burning
And hatred hides in a mortal shell
All years you abhorrent life form
Spreading your blight
Been depraving our way
But the pain has strengthened our mind
And the purified eyes
Have brought us to see

Preach for me not you cradle of pain
From the hate you rouse I burn in my veins
All you begat will be amassed
And some day your order shall be destroyed
Destroyed by the will
Gone, destroyed by the will
