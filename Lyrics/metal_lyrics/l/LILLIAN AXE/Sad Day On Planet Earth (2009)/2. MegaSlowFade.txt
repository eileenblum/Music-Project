Hailing Big snow above
White the light of day
I cash my soul for fortunes I'm told
Never seem to find the way

Slinking through the desert night
Wishing you were here
Waves in the sand never washing my hands
All my friends are here

What we don't know still is painful

Lifer of an arrogant time
My ways akin to my kind
I live here I live here
Pay your respects

Patient waiting
Velvet painting
Mental upgrade
mega slow fade eating me

Lightning big storm ahead
Clip the light of day
Watery road with the slip of my wheel
Wash our lives away

High above the mountains where the icecaps meet the sun
Why dig low when you can have it

Virus detestable kind
Eats up what's in my mind yeah
insatia- insatia- insatiable

Patient waiting
Velvet painting
Mental upgrade
mega slow fade eating me

Virus detestable kind
Eats up what's in my mind yeah

Patient waiting
