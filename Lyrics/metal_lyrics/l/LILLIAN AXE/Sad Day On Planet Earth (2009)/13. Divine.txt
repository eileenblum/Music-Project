Did you shiver as the steel went through you
All eyes focused on your ride
Their words became your cyanide

Could you ever believe in a secret
That would make you whole again
As you bathe in the fallout from on high

How does it feel
To be divine

Did you leave us so they'd start to wonder
Such a primal intensity
Disappointment for the world to see, yeah

Did you ever believe it would end here
As a ghost ripping through their fears
Did you come back to bid your last goodbye

How does it feel
To be divine
Why do you kneel
You're so divine

[Guitar solos]

Now and then we have the pain to remember
Just how ugly we've all become
Do we have to destroy just to pass the time

How does it feel
To be divine
Why do you kneel
You're so divine, yeah
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be divine
Why do you kneel
You're so divine
You're so divine
