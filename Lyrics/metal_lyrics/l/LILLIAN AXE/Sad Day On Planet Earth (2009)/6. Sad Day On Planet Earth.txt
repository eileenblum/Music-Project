Standing alone on a hill overlooking the ocean
Darkness sets in but the sun will never shine home again
What will I say to my mother who knew this would come
It's the same old song
It grows louder and louder

Feed your flesh have your say
Apathy's King today
Why such a crying shame?
It's a sad day on planet Earth
It's a sad day

I remember the day when I felt the cord being severed
we ventured too far as our purity melted into the dirt
Why can't we see that the end is the beginning
It's the same old song
It grows louder and louder

Feed your flesh have your say
Apathy's King today
Why such a lonely place?
It's a sad day on planet Earth
It's a sad sad day on planet Earth
It's a sad day

I watched the planets and heavens collide
And all I could do was bow down
Dry, no saliva, unquenchable thirst
Silence the deafening sound
Wake up and see what we've done

Close your eyes, fall asleep
Mercy please your soul to keep
Devil comes, Golden lies,
Sweet caress dead surprise

Told you once, warned you twice
Give your bleeding hand to the world
Hoping it will save you
It's a sad day on planet Earth
It's a sad sad day on planet Earth
It's a sad day on planet Earth

What you say How you feel What you do
it's time for rebirth
