Do you remember when our lives were so complete?
Long cold Decembers, so bittersweet,

[Chorus:]
But if you could set aside one day,
That I could hold forever
I would save the day that I met you.

Is it still magic although we've grown worlds apart?
It seem so tragic, so frail the heart.

[Chorus:]
But if I was blessed with just one wish
To take me through my lonely life
I'd wish to go back to the day that I met you

And when you fell you're on your own
Well just believe you're not alone
And you feel the warmth
That we shared years ago
Don't be blue

One painful morning, I stared straight into the sun,
It overwhelmed me, I came undone

[Chorus:]
So, if you can find it in your heart
To be forgiving to a broken man,
We'll go back to the day that I met you.

[Chorus]
