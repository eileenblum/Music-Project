"We're not here to hurt you," the voices told me, then they laughed away.
"Sit, relax, stay calm" Now they control me they rule my day.

[Bridge:]
Everybody needs someone to talk to
With a fire and a body that can touch you,
Even now I think I need somebody,
Don't think that I could ever have my time alone

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm a captive soul,
To the voices of my walls

Fear has settled in, my room commands me,
Keeps me warm inside,
Sleep exists no more, a living zombie
I'm mystified.

[Bridge]

'Cause I'm a captive soul,
Listen in wonder, the secret I've been told
By the voices in my walls

"Come with us give us control, and we'll possess your heart and soul,
You'll see new colors you can't describe, and feel strange things you've never tried."

Candlelight for me, a fading sunset,
Take me away

I'm a captive soul
Living in wonder the secrets I've been told
By the voices in my walls
You gotta believe me
The secrets amaze and confuse me with no self-control,
The voices are calling me now
The voices are calling me now
I'm a captive soul
