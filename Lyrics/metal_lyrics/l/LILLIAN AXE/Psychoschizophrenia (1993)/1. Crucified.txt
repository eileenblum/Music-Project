Come a little closer with your thoughts of an insurrection,
A little black mark in the book of your life could bring a change of your affection,
Got an one track mind, it's a sign of the times, find a whole new revelation,
Prime time, any time, pay the bailiff for your crime,
Don't lose your concentration,

No, No, No, I don't want to be crucified

Got a heavy cross to bear when there's salt in your lacerations
At least when I die I can look 'em in the eye, see them off to eternal damnation,
See the bloodstained curtains in the temple of love
Where the true is a state of your mind,
Kneel down, kiss the ground, better never make a sound
How can they see when they're so damn blind?

[Chorus:]
Can you believe in something
Not fit for their consumption?
Hold on strong to the end
Use the force in the back of your mind
I can't accept what they say
I choose to go my own way
I don't want to be crucified

Flying high, sanctify, living a lie by the hand of intoxication,
Under attack, see the scars on my back, think it's time for a needed vacation

No, No, No, I don't want to be crucified

[Chorus]
