I had a dream of great catastrophes,
And all the children cried a thousand seas,
While all the love we watched them lay to rest,
We stood up straight and tall and let them,
Let them put us to the test,
And we won, and love have saved the day
Then I woke, and evil got away

And on your throne you condescend so well,
If I could have my way you'd burn in hell,
While I watched you steal the bread from open arms
As you promise to protect their lives from harm

[Bridge:]
Bow down to those who prey
For they shall have their day

[Pre-Chorus:]
Hey you, whatcha gonna do to me
Down so low, can't you look around and see,
There's hope, truth is gonna set you free
You don't know, meaning of equality

[Chorus:]
Fighting to erase the dynasty,
Of those who prey on me.

And on your life you swear on lust and greed,
But the cries of hurting children makes you bleed,
Can you see your demon right before your eyes,
They're no good to you, except for cheap disguise,

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Now one day soon the righteous will unite
And upon your head, the blind will gain their sight

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Gonna put an end to the misery and those who prey will see

[Chorus]
