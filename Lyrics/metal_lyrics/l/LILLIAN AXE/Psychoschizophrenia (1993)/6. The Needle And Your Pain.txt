Feel like I'm losing again
Slipping away is the faith I used to cling to,
Life seems too strange to be real,
Watching you take it all in stride,

[Chorus:]
Just for you,
I'd take the needle and your pain,
Away from you
One for you

Time has no mind for regret
Watching you bite on the bullet you were born with
How do you sit there at ease?
While something inside you steals your peace.

[Chorus:]
Just for you,
I'd take the needle and your pain,
Away from you
I'd give you shelter from the rain
One for you

No one can convince me that there's method to this madness,
As I watch you fade,
The hours tick away,
With the courage of a lion,
And a steadfast heart of gold,
You gave me strength while the flames
Of my hope burned so cold

Feeling the heat once again,
Handed us hope as you rose up from the ashes,
Gone is the pain so be free,
Now, in your name, we can see.

[Chorus]
