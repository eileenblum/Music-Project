I've been watching from across the room
As you free your mind
They all tell me that you're far away,
I believe I'll stay awhile,
I'd like to help you find your golden mile

[Bridge:]
Dreaming, Crying, Hoping, Trying,
Praying, Dying,
Gets you through another day

Running, Flying, Escape, Denying
No one's trying to explain

[Chorus:]
What do you want?
What do you need?
Do you enjoy watching me plead?
What do you see?
What do you love?
The moonlight in your blood.
What do you feel?
Who do you love?
There's moonlight in your blood.

Spend your nights inside a silk cocoon,
Butterfly,
Your soul could never die
I see you leave us as you stare at the moon
And you'll live again,
I only wish that I could share your pain,

[Bridge]
[Chorus x2]
