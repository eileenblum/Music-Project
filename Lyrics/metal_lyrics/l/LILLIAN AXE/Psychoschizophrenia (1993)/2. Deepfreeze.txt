Time and time again
I need reminding of where I've been
Helplessly scared, left so alone,
This time I'll make a journey on my own
Don't stop me now, as this begins
I fell a brave and new awakening

Yet life goes on
But I'll be gone
A brand new life awaits me

Mind, slipping in a deepfreeze
Blind, Living with an uneased mind,

Mind, Slipping in a Deepfreeze
Blind, Living in a deepfreeze

Time to go away
Escape confusion and disarray,
I found a peace, tranquility
My newborn love, my secret mystery,
My soul lives on, beyond the skies,
My questions answered I say good-bye

[Chorus]
