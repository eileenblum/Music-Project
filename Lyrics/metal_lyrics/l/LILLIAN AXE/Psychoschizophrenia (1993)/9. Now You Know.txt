Well I felt this coming on for a long, long time
When everything turns red, it's such a bad sign
Just a little bit of light would've helped me see
That every loaded gun wasn't aimed at me
Could've set me free

You made me
Betrayed me
Too many times
A jaded Delilah
Live, learn, and die

Now you know

Been livin' with my head in the deep, blue sea
So why does every one seem so afraid of me?
Just a little bit of air would've helped me breathe
When there is no such solution take your leave
Put your mind at ease

Release me just to please me, Way too late
Your time was impatient. Seal my fate

Now you know

You think the start of this was yesterday
Been scratchin' and clawin' just to find my way out
How could you ever let me dig so deep?

Well, Now I know
Now you know
Now you know
