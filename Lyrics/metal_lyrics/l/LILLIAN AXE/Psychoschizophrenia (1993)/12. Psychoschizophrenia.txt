Hey brother, can you spare some time?
It seems I've lost my mind
I'm one strange personality
Have I gone crazy?
Yeah, please take me somewhere new.

I don't associate with people, you see
Maybe that's what's troubling me
I feel rebellion's overdue
So chain me up now,
You'll get what's coming to you

[Chorus:]
Hey, I'm Psychoschizophrenia

Thunderstorms evolving inside of me,
Straight jacket quick and swallow the key
My sanity lives on the edge
But I'm so happy
I'm going away,

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

It's all in your mind, it's all in your mind
