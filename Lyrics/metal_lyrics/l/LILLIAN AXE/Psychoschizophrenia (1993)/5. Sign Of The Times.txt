Cast your worries to the seas,
You can do just what you please,
Don't you know that happiness is free,
Disguised to hide the reasons,
We believe just what we see.

It's time to look beyond the real,
While you create the life you feel,
Everybody needs their time,
Scaling mountains they can't climb,
Falling down to their knees.

[Chorus:]
It's a sign of the times
Do you want to be
Just a sign of the times
It's the end of the line
Such a tragedy
It's a sign of the times

Shooting stars light up the sky
We march on prepared to die
I won't let them take my sense of pride, no,
Safe beneath the shelter,
But your face you cannot hide

It's time that people realize
What stares them right between their eyes
Everybody's wasting time,
Trying to make the world all rhyme,
It's so easy to see

[Chorus:]
It's a sign of the times
Do you want to be
Just a sign of the times
It's the end of the line
Your animosity
It's a sign of the times
Don't you feel it?
It's a sign of the times

[Chorus]
