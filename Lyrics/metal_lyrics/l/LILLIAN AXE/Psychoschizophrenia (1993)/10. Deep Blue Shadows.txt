I'm walking alone incognito so no one will know
But watching eyes catch a glimpse of what's hidden below
Does there always have to be this complication?
Do you have to live by selfish motivation?

[Chorus:]
Take my hand, we'll hide away,
We'll sleep beneath the open skies
What you say and what you do
They're always gonna criticize
Make your fantasies the drive
It seems that just the strong survive
So whenever you can feel it
Keep your deep blue shadows alive

I'm watching your steps.
I've got eyes in the back of my head
Don't make the wrong moves if they see you
You're better off dead, yeah
Do I always have to give some explanation?
To the critics who can't understand expression?

[Chorus:]
Take my hand, we'll hide away,
We'll sleep beneath the open skies
What you did and where you've been
They're always gonna criticize
Just because they can't relate
Don't let it stop your overdrive
Whenever you can taste it
Keep your deep blue shadows alive

[Chorus]
