Somewhere in my mind
Is the fear of growing old
Deep inside my heart
The warmth has turned to cold
My tired eyes, slipping away
Tired life

[Chorus:]
Waiting in the dark
To take his shot at me
Father time's a cruel man
Will I resurrect
Or will I even know
Sorrow is the master plan

Lie in bed at night
Will there be another day
Body aches in pain
Things they don't seem quite the same

Nobody cares, No one to share
Tired life

[Chorus:]
Waiting in the dark
To take his shot at me
Father time's a cruel man
Will I resurrect
Or will I even know
Sorrow is the master plan
