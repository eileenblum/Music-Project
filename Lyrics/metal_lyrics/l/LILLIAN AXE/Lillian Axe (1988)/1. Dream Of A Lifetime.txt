An eye for an eye, a heart for a heart
That's the way that we play
Up in the cloud, where's angels fly
You take my breath away.

[Bridge 1:]
Your love is my heaven
Now I'm going that way, hey, hey
And when I get there
You know I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

[Chorus:]
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa, yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes, you are

Caught up in the roles that we play
It's foolish game
There's nothing we can't do or be
If we want it the same

[Bridge 2:]
If I had all my chances
To look you away, hey, hey
Now when I find ya,
you know I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

[Chorus:]
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa, yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes, you are
