Too late - for crawling on your knees
Too late - too late to beg me please
Forget the things you said to me
No way - to ever change my mind
No way - no way to find the time
To change the feelings we once shared

Now I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing, I'm laughing in your face

Too bad - I found my pot of gold
Too bad - too bad you're getting much too old
To play your silly games with me
Look now - at who believes in who
See how - the tables turned on you
Let's see who's smiling now

Now I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing, I'm laughing in your face

And now I'm on the rebound
And I've found my own space
You're feeling rotten and forgotten
While I'm laughing in your face

And now I'm on the rebound
And I've found my own space
You're feeling rotten and forgotten
While I'm laughing in your face

In your face
I'm laughing, I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing, I'm laughing
I'm laughing, I'm laughing in your face
Laughing in your face
