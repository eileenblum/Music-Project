Light the fire of love tonight
You know I've always had you in my sights
But I finally have the chance to love you
So picture perfect in the light of the stars
Played so close but I want so far
Got struck by the poison of Cupid's arrow

[Chorus:]
But tomorrow comes the sorrow
Like a story book
It only took one look
'cause last night it seemed
Like things were picture perfect

Want your sudden love every night
I dreamed you'd be, got to love you right
But I find it so hard to even approach you
As the stars find your lovely smile
Your fangs like devil were sharply filed
Got to question about your reputation

[Chorus]

No longer love you like the way I did
I'll never be a fool like that again
It only took one night
To prove your precious point
Did you think that we could just be friends

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, picture perfect
Hey, hey, hey, picture perfect
Last night it seemed
Like things were picture perfect
