Down and out, like a fox on the run
My baby's gone, now I'm the lonely one
On top of that, it looks like I'm going bald

My friends are two faced, and my moneys gone
I got a ticket when my car broke down
A rainy day, now, what else could go wrong?

[Bridge 1:]
Now who's the judge?
Whats my crime?
Ain't no sentence, but I'm still doing time.

[Chorus:]

Cause Misery
Misery Loves Company
Cause Misery, Misery
Misery Loves Company

Cold and hungry like a dog in the street
I get a raw deal, everyone I meet
All I want is some loving and a little respect, thats all

The poor get nothing while the rich get fat
Start living good, the I.R.S. takes that
I kinda wonder if theres really any good at all, at all

[Bridge 2:]
So whats it like
To have a smile?
Id like to have one, but its not my style

[Chorus]
[Solo]

[Bridge 1]
[Chorus]
