The hammer falls under the neon skies
The city lights reflecting in my eyes

Roll the dice a turn of the wheel
Its my turn to call
If it weren't for hard luck
Id have no luck at all

[Chorus:]
Hard lucks got a hold on me
I bet against the odds
Hard lucks coming down on me
Its in the fall of the cards
Hard luck

The nights my savior she keeps me in the dark
A bad shot it seems Ive missed the mark

Like salt in my wounds
It burns me up inside
Nowhere to run to now
Nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
[Solo]
[Chorus]

I got some hard luck
It's comin' down to hard luck
All I got is hard luck
Yeah
