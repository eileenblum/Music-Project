You're taking our words
You turn them inside out
You're stealing our words
For something to write about

It's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts all upside down
Front page fallacy
It's time you hear from me, yeah

[Chorus:]
We're gonna turn you - inside out
You'll twist and turn - inside out
It's time you learn - inside out
Fear for your integrity

You can't hear
What we're trying to say
We're not marionettes
It's our turn to play

Sitting on your throne of greed
Trying to take our thoughts away, away
Stand up for the cause
Cause we're all here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]

Inside out, inside out
Now it's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts around, around, around
Front page fallacy
It's time you hear from me

We're gonna turn you - inside out
Turn you around - inside out
It ain't like it sounds - inside out
I'm the one who speaks for me

We're gonna turn you - inside out
You'll twist and turn - inside out
That is why I sing this song
I know I'm right and you are wrong

Inside out [Repeat]
