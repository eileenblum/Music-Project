A long time ago
Like a fool I thought I could love you
The more that I tried
The more that you lied, I believed in you

You say you can get
Any man that you want
But keeping one's a different story

[Chorus 1:]
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you want
And I'm the one to give you some

You break my heart
Just feed on the tears that I'm crying
When we make love
It's all we can do, but you're lying

Oh yeah, you say you can get
Any man that you want
But holding on's a different story

[Chorus 2:]
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you take
It's time that I steal your heart away

[Chorus 1]

The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get

The more that you get
The more that you take
The more that you want
