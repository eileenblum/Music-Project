Now when your blue skies turn to grey
And your eyes still turn away
It's the time to let it go

Out of the dark will shine a light
Everything's in black and white
'Til you let your spirit grow.

Stars would shine above you
So everybody loved you
So why'd you go and throw it all away?

The Times, they are a-changing
My life is rearranging
I'm living in the grey, yeah.

Breathing with a reason
The everlasting season
I'm living in the grey, yeah.

So many years until today
Lost, but now you've found the way
An open mind can open eyes
So now you're open to the pain
Sitting naked in the rain
Well, I will dry the tears you cry.

Angels must have sent you
Coz everybody meant to give you time
But then you slipped away.

The Times, they are a-changing
My life is rearranging
I'm living in the grey, yeah.
Breathing with a reason
The everlasting season
I'm living in the grey, yeah.

Stars would shine above you
So everybody loved you
So why'd you go and throw it all away.

The Times, they are a-changing
My life is rearranging
I'm living in the grey, yeah.
Breathing with a reason
The everlasting season
I'm living in the grey, yeah.

The Times, they are a-changing
My life is rearranging
I'm living in the grey, yeah.
Breathing with a reason
The everlasting season
I'm living in the grey, yeah, yeah, yeah.
