I never looked behind me
Never saw the shadows smile
Never watched the red light warning
All I wanted was to be in touch with you.

Took a chance on inner healing.
Said it was the way to go
Find a way to make you happy
Can't do it, never could but what a show
Oh, no.

I look to you, you look to me
It's all the same, just one big game
You say it's me, I say it's you
You touched my love, with Shades of Blue

But maybe now
When you lose control
You'll see what I could give,
Trapped inside your heart,
I'm dyin' to live.

One man without a mission
Like an eagle, flying slow
I wanted to kiss the blue sky,
But all the clouds were hanging far too low.

And then one day, I looked away,
Into the air, the Lord was there.
He broke the sky, the sun flew by,
I died for you, Shades of Blue.

But maybe now
When you lose control
You'll see what I could give,
Trapped inside your heart,
I'm dyin' to live.

And if the moon is bright
The stars would all kiss you,
The colors of my heart
Are Shades of Blue.

But maybe now
When you lose control
You'll see what I could give,
Trapped inside your heart,
I'm dyin' to live.

When you lose control
You'll see what I could give,
Trapped inside your heart,
I'm dyin' to live, dyin' to live.
Dyin' to live.
