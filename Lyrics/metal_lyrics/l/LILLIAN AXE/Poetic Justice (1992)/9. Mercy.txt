I can't seem to find the words to say the things I want to
Say to you, I must be burnin' out.
One night, a long, long time ago,
My mother told me I should go to you,
With all my thoughts and dreams.

Please, please tell me,
What you gonna do, when every princess comes to you singin'?

Lord have mercy, mercy on my soul,
Please have mercy, salvation for my soul.

It's just that I can't justify
How you can let them do the things they do.
Well, I'd let them have it good.

They laugh and totally forget,
That all creation is because of you,
How do you do such things?

Please, please tell me,
What you gonna do when all the losers cling to you, singin'?

Lord have mercy, mercy on my soul,
Please have mercy, salvation and some mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy on my soul.

Lord have mercy, mercy on my soul,
Please have mercy, salvation for my soul.
Lord have mercy, mercy on my soul,
Please have mercy, salvation and some mercy, mercy, mercy,
Mercy on my soul.
