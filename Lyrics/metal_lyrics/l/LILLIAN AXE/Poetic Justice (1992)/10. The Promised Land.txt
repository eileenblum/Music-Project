Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
And every moment I'm awake
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

Now as I walk down this winding road,
I need you to lighten the load.
Hey, now, take my hand,
I'll lead you to the Promised Land.

One cold December,
So long ago,
We watched the snow cling to the trees.

Your lips were so warm
As you kissed my hand
We would have sailed the seven seas.

But when you walked away,
Said you could not stay,
And love lay dying like a wounded dove.

But if you come back now,
I will take your hand
And lead you to the Promised Land.

Are you feeling lonely?
Do you need a friend?
Well, is the pain too much to stand?

The seeds of love
Are sown inside
And the memories of our lives will guide our hand.

So as you fly away
I will sing the day
And meet you in the Promised Land.
Take my hand to the Promised Land.

But when you walked away,
Said you could not stay,
And love lay bleeding like a wounded dove.
But if it needs to be
Then I will set you free.
And meet you in the Promised Land.
Take my hand to the Promised Land.

Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
And every moment I'm awake
I pray the Lord your soul to take
