What you see is what you get
The flavor stays the same.
Live a life of fantasy
Or lead a life of shame.
One goes here, one goes there
Illusion they create
I'll bet a million dollars you can't differentiate.

They'll lead you into the fire.  Hot, hot.
Which one's the better liar?
Body Double

Mirror, mirror on the wall don't show me any lies
They can't get it wrong, no matter just how hard they try.

Twice as fun as anyone
Their trick's a treat for me.
I can't get enough of that split personality.

Teach me how you fooled the world again
Tell me how to make this game of love begin.
Show me differences that only I can tell.

Two of a kind
Only one in my mind
Body Double, Hot, hot
Body Double, Hot, hot

Which is which and who is who
It's all the same to me
Both completely different with the same identity
Back and forth for hours,
Up and down and in between
Something I can deal with doing single-handedly

Teach me how you fooled the world again
Tell me how to make this game of love begin.
Show me differences that only I can tell.
Two of a kind,
Only one in my mind
Body Double, Hot, hot

Double all your pleasure while they double all the fun.
Bending over backwards as you kiss the other one
Who's the girl you fell in love with?
Does she feel the same?
When the party's over baby,
I'm so glad you came.

Teach me how you fooled the world again
Tell me how to make this game of love begin.
Show me differences that only I can tell.
Two of a kind,
Only one in my mind
I'm still trying to find out
Which one had been mine.
Body Double, Hot, hot
Body Double, Hot, hot
Body Double, Body Double
