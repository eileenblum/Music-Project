I can move the mountains on a clear day,
But sometimes they can crash into the sea.
Look around, choose your poison.
Otherwise, you'll have no choice in living
Your life the way it's mean to be.

But one more believer is all that we need.
The scars on our knees is the proof that we bleed.
But I know, oh, I know
Where to go

Oh, cuz she's my salvation
When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.
She's my salvation.

One lover's pain is another man's relief.
But I know, oh, I know
This feeling's got to go.

When the time is right, you'll see a new way.
The road is paved with gold and leads you home again.

Bad news most everyday,
Wonder why I run away
Got to find a sanctuary.
Find your own peace in the rules that you make.

Believin' your eyes is the first big mistake.
But I know, oh, I know
Where to go.

Oh, cuz she's my salvation
When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.
Oh, now, she's my salvation.
One lover's pain is another man's relief.
But I know, oh, I know
This feeling's got to go.

Now she's my salvation
When the world gets oh so lonely I escape.
Oh, now she's my inspiration
Unspoken lies, another fool's belief.
But I know, oh, I know
This feeling's got to go.
She's my Salvation, She's my Salvation
She's my Salvation, She's my Salvation

The first big mistake is letting
The things around you get you down.
Find salvation in something or someone
And make that your sanctuary.
Unless you do this, you're lost.
