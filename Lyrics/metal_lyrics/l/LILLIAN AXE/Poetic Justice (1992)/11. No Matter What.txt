No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do girl
Ooh girl, with you

No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you've found girl ?
Ooh girl, won't you ?

Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all.
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
I would you give it to you.
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter where you go
There will always be a place
Can't you see it in my face, girl ?
Ooh girl want you

Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all.
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
I would you give it to you.
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be

No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do girl
Ooh girl, with you

No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you've found girl ?
Ooh girl, won't you ?

Ooh girl
You girl
Want you
