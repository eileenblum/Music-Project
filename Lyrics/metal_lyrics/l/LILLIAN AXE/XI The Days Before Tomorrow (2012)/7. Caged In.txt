There's a pressure mounting in my head
There's a three headed monster hiding under bed
There's a banshee screaming in my throat
I'm a haven for aggravation

What a feeling
Raging

Catch a killer hang him by his neck
Catch a worthless killer hang him by his neck
Catch a worthless killer hang him by his neck
I'm your superhero connection

What a feeling
Raging

Draw conclusions
I don't care
I'm in your mind and I like it there
You love the same things I despise
You're not my answer, no, no, no

There's a little man living in my head
There's a little mad man living in my head
There's a little blue man living in my head
He's the product of my intentions

What a feeling
Raging

Draw conclusions
I don't care
I'm in your mind and I like it there
You love the same things I despise
You're not my answer, no, no, no

Resurrection
I can't contain the beast within
It moves right through me
This red light I see
I can't control the suffering

There's a pressure mounting in my head
There's a pressure mounting in my head
There's a volcanic pressure mounting in my head
I'm a haven for everyone's bullshit

What a feeling
Raging

Draw conclusions
I don't care
I'm in your mind and I like it there
You love the same things I despise
You're not my answer, no, no, no
