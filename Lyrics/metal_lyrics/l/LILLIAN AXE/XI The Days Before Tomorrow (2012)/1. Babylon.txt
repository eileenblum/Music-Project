My mind is ease
To fight what it sees
As ignorance flees
Knowledge is Power

On Mercury's wings
The hummingbird sings
The message that stings
The final hour now

Lead us out of temptation
Guide us into salvation
Curse my hand

When the dark hides the light its a cloak for the innocent
When the blood disappears its a phony absolution for the sheep with no sight

The time is at hand
To nurture the land
To drink from the sand
Honor the seasons

The stories I've heard
Defaming the Word
Defining absurd
I know the reasons now

Save us from medication
Fill us with new sensations
Curse the land

When the dead walk the earth it's a sign for the innocent
When the base turns to gold it's a secret that the magic's hiding place is found out

My spirit's at ease
At one with the seas
I hear the decrees
Knowledge is Power
The voices are sweet
Till one day we'll meet
The end of deceit
The sacred hour now

Lead us out of temptation
Guide us into salvation
Curse my hand

When the dark hides the light its a cloak for the innocent
When the blood disappears its a phony absolution for the sheep with no sight
When the dead walk the earth it's a sign for the innocent
When the base turns to gold it's a secret that the magic's hiding place is found out
