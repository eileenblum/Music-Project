The time to cease has come
Our day beneath the sun
Eyes glowing rays to see
Lies that desecrate me

And I fall down
on my knees that tend to break
I'm losing sleep
Wondering how our lives they infiltrate

Into your Father's eyes
You are beloved
You are the royalty
Across the Great Divide
We are relentless
To separate the treasure from the thief

And now the end is near
The way to choose is clear
Wide open skies above
Fly with wings that save me

As I look down
To the center of creation
They curse my name
With burning lips
No thirst to satiate

Into your Father's eyes
You are beloved
You are the royalty
Across the Great Divide
We are relentless
To separate the dragon from the meat

And we stand strong
Looking down at the hell we've made

Into your Father's eyes
You are beloved
You are the royalty
Across the Great Divide
We are relentless
To separate the treasure from the thief
Across the Great Divide
Across the Great Divide
Across the Great Divide
