Hey Son
Take my hand
Hear my words
Live them best as you can

As we tried to make this good
We became misunderstood
God help us
Go Son

Hey now
Swim the seas
Say your rosaries
Hey now
Give it your best
Put the broken lies to rest

Hey Son
This I swear
Deep in your heart
I will always be there

If this old world gets you down
Look for me and you'll be found
God help us
Go Son

Hey now
Love is free
Sleep so peacefully
Hey now
Look to the skies
Let the light shine in your eyes

I am the bird without a song
I am the right that cures the wrong
I am the wisdom of the trees
Please accept my apologies

Hey now
Swim the seas
Say your rosaries
Hey now
Give it your best
Put the broken lies to rest
Hey now
Love is free
Sleep so peacefully
Hey now
Look to the skies
Let the light shine in your eyes

THE IMPOSSIBLE IS BORN
