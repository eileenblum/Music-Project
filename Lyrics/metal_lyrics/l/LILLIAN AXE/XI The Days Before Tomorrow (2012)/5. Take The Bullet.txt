Coldness and wet
The ground was frozen
Our minds were dead
and disillusioned by fire
It was a dead zone
It was a war zone
It was our only home
With the pleasantries of battle
But how else could we see it
I'll take the bullet for you

Follow me
Follow me

Piercing the flesh
The world was waiting
For pictures and wounds and death
So beautifully wondrous
It was a good time
It was a landmine
A bloody fun time
With the happiness of battle
But how else could we see it
I'll take the bullet for you

Follow me
Follow me

And when the dogs of war should cease
Lay in the belly of the beast
I will then lay my hands on you
And welcome you warmly to life in the human zoo
