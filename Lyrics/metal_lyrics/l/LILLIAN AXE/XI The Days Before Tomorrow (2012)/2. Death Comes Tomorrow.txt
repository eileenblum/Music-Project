I felt the scorching of the sun
The unforgiving ground beneath me
I heard the crackling of the rain
The strikes of lightning came to set me free

I split the darkness with the light
I crumbled mountains at my sight
Slept beneath the naked sky
All to answer questions
Why I crash through waves of torment
And leave behind a trail that no man can see

Black skies illuminating
My destiny is waiting now
Death Comes Tomorrow
Let me be

I drank the blood from my own lips
The taste surprisingly deceived me
Ten thousand miles of scars I bear
Even vultures know to leave me be

I crushed the serpent with a smile
I spoke with Jesus for a while
Waved the comets from the sky
All to give me answers
Why I dream in colors that I've never seen
And wake to find that nothing seems real

Black skies illuminating
My destiny is waiting now
Death Comes Tomorrow
My jaws are salivating
The dogs of war are waiting now
Death comes tomorrow
Let me be

Come now my son
Your journey is ending
So rest in peace
Disciple ascending
Today the world will mourn your soul

Why I crash through waves of torment
And leave behind a trail that no man can see

Black skies illuminating
My destiny is waiting now
Death Comes Tomorrow
My jaws are salivating
The dogs of war are waiting now
Death comes tomorrow
Let me be

I saw the lights shine far away
The streets of gold lay down beneath me
It was the best of days to die
Now the blessed come to set me free
