Time, my public enemy, deciding what I see
A blessing and a curse for all mankind
The wasted grip of death
Is beaten by my breath
I hold on to the diamonds in my mind,
And everywhere I go,
I gather up the snow
and mix it with the rays of sunlight's fire
So now the game is waiting
The past is slowly fading
But never will I let my treasures go

Disillusion is an empty glass of broken reasons
Taste the waters of the flowing streams and know that they are wondrous
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to lose the day

Fight, obliterate the pain
Appreciate the gain
And understand that life is such a gift
And time will take its toll
While bearing down your soul
But nothing ever can steal who you are
I see it every day
I'm not afraid to say
That there is only one road paved with gold
Intentions guide your path
And deviate the wrath
So undermine the chains that bind you

Isolation is the beast that keeps you from ascending
Find the road to everlasting peace and know that it is precious
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to lose the day
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to lose the day

Someday soon the world will sing a different tune
And all God's creatures will as one eclipse the moon

I see it every day
I'm not afraid to say
That there is only one road paved with gold
Intentions guide your path
And deviate the wrath
So undermine the chains that bind you

Disillusion is an empty glass of broken reasons
Taste the waters of the flowing streams and know that they are wondrous
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to lose the day
I don't want to fade away
I don't want to lose the day
I don't want to fade away
