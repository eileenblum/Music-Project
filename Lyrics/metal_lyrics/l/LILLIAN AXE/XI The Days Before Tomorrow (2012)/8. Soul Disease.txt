Run, run from the way we are
Never look back
It's too late, we have gone too far

Now take your leave
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Chase the stars tonight

Mine, Mine is the jaded past
Fight through the fires and
fly on the wings that were made to last

Now run away
On this dark holiday
Find the stars tonight

One step closer to the end of my rope
With the weight of the world on a slippery slope
Justified for every act we do
As I watch you fly with the greatest of ease
You could level every kingdom from wherever you please
Just don't take from me
I could use some sympathy
To put my mind at ease
Cant you see
Find the cure
My soul disease

Feed off the world you scorn
Maybe one day soon
We will be reborn

One step closer to the end of my rope
With the weight of the world on a slippery slope
Justified for every act we do
As I watch you fly with the greatest of ease
You could level every kingdom from wherever you please
Just don't take from me
I could use some sympathy
To put my mind at ease
Cant you see
Find the cure
My soul disease
