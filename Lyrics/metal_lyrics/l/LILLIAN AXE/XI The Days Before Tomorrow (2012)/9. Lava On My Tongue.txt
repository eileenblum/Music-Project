Fear was kind on the day of peace
Mind was cool in this time of release
Tempt my soul with visions of times that we'll never see
Taste the blood and sweat of passion
And touch the wind and sky
It's something you need

Too much anger in my space
All a lie to me
Want to start a fire in my mind
Set my demons free
Keep a little vengeance in your eyes
It helps to find the sun
Lava on my tongue

Feeling cold
As the days disappear
Holding on
I perservere

Lift your hands and reach
Surrender the hate on which you feed
Crawling on bellies
Engorged like a tick
How I feel the love and pain
It's something I need

Too much anger in my space
All a lie to me
Want to start a fire in my mind
Set my demons free
Keep a little vengeance in your eyes
It helps to find the sun
Lava on my tongue

Lying patiently beneath his wings
He waits for me to cross the line
Tigerlike he so enjoys the game
Letter to the design
Pouncing upon what is mind

Fear was kind on the day of peace
Mind was cool in this time of release
Tempt my soul with visions of times that we'll never see
Taste the blood and sweat of passion
And touch the wind and sky
It's something you need

Too much anger in my space
All a lie to me
Want to start a fire in my mind
Set my demons free
Keep a little vengeance in your eyes
It helps to find the sun
Oh I fear what I've become
Lava on my tongue
