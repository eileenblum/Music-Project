I felt the waters rising up on me
I drowned a thousand times but washed up from the sea
Well I can take it, so I can break it
Melt it slowly
Fireflies paint the skies
Do we really need to burn?

And everything I see
Is jaded from the light that I used to follow
And everything I need
Slips right through the cracks as I watch it wash away

I drank the waters poisoned from the tree
I died a thousand times but woke up just to breathe
Well I can feel it ripping through me
Like a tiger
Well I can take you to nirvana
With a simple mind

And everything I see
Is jaded from the light that I used to follow
And everything I need
Slips right through the cracks as I watch it wash away

I can feel it
Ripping through me
I can feel it
I can take you to nirvana
Well I can take you

And everything I see
Is jaded from the light that I used to follow
And everything I need
Slips right through the cracks as I watch it wash away
