Recondition mind position
Power whatâs in store
Junk omission, mental fission
Strong forevermore
Space age, so they say
Too good to be true
Bite the hand that feeds the crap to you
Fire in your eyes, high above the rest
You are the mountain

Hide, Iâm obsolete
I donât belong here
I am complete
Become a monster, become a freak
We donât belong here with the weak

Educate, obliterate
Denounce your darkest fear
Adrenaline the drink of the win
Demand or disappear
Burning, jump your skin
Beat your body blue
Find the dog that threw the bone to you
Catch straying mice
Dip them in the sea
Baptize the liar

Hide, Iâm obsolete
I donât belong here
I am complete
Become a monster, become a freak
We donât belong here with the weak

When all the sheep went out to graze
The devilâs hounds said, âGod be praisedâ
To stand alone, to walk the coals
Bury the dead, and fill the holes
Bleeding from the stomach as your breath leaves from your heart
Feel the monster rising as it rips your soul apart
Painfully you question inner strength you try to hide
Raise your fist to heaven, feel the monster from inside

Space age, so they say
Too good to be true
Bite the hand that feeds the crap to you
Fire in your eyes high above the rest
You are the mountain

Hide, Iâm obsolete
I donât belong here
I am complete
Become a monster, become a freak
We donât belong here with the weak

Monster, become a monster
I am a monster
I am a freak
I am a mindfuck
I am a monster
I donât belong here with the weak
