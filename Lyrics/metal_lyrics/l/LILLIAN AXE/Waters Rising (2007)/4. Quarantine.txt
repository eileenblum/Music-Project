Too late to meditate to change whatâs so obscene
Hide away I choose to stay inside my quarantine
Iâll let you crawl inside where the clientele are few
Weâve come a long, long way just to have a drink with you

Iâve seen it everyday as my walls are closing in
I plan the great escape with my patience wearing thin

Out of my web, Iâm a little anxious being touched by you
Just canât seem to find a view
My religion seems to break in two
Save me

Take a trip inside my mind
Absorb all I have seen
Fight the scream and find a home inside my quarantine

I feel amazing satisfaction talking to myself
But when the clouds approach my insides donât feel too well

Out of my mind, get a little nervous when I smell your kind
Decaying mastermind
If they get you and are so inclined
Clean like me
Time to leave cause somethingâs closing in on me
The way Iâve chosen runs to the sea
Where nothingâs sacred unless you believe inside my quarantine

Iâll let you crawl inside where the clientele are few
Weâve come a long, long way just to have a drink with you

Out of my web, Iâm a little anxious being touched by you
Just canât seem to find a view
My religion seems to break in two
Let me be

Time to leave cause somethingâs closing in on me
The way Iâve chosen runs to the sea
Where nothingâs sacred unless you believe inside my quarantine
