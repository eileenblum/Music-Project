I climbed the mountains and scaled the ice
Released defiance
My blood ran white, cold and numb

I saw the shadows of demigods
Whispering answers that time forgot
Forever true

Iâm frozen blue
Thereâs not much time
I died for you

A true believer, the king of lies
We all betrayed you
Your blood ran white

Iâm frozen blue
Thereâs not much time
I died for you

Antarctica
