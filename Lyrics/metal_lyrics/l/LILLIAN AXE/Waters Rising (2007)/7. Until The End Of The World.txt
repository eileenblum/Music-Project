She came to me one summer night
The moon was red, the time was right
She whispered in my ear, âYouâve got to go.â
Fly away and make a new start
Discover what sets you apart
She kissed me on the cheek and disappeared

I realized what I had feared
So Iâm searching for my judgment day

Heartless is the cold, under the stars I pray
Lifeless is the dark, my passion lights the way

Run with me, no boundary can block my point of view
Escape with me, a fantasy come true
Endless seasons with you
Till the end Iâm with you
Until the end of the world

Find it hard to say goodbye
To understand the reasons why
Iâve got to break the chains that hold me down
Still I wish youâd show your face again
As Iâm searching, itâs just not the same

I canât recall what games children play
Faceless is the flame that lights my golden way

Run with me, no boundary can block my point of view
Escape with me, a fantasy come true
Endless seasons with you
Till the end Iâm with you
Until the end of the world

Iâm left alone while nature takes its toll
Just let me be so I can save my soul

Run with me, no boundary can block my point of view
Escape with me, a fantasy come true
Endless seasons with you
Till the end Iâm with you
Until the end of the world

She came to me one summer night
The moon was red, the time was right
She whispered in my ear, âYouâve got to go.â
And fighting back the tears
She kissed me on the cheek and let me go
