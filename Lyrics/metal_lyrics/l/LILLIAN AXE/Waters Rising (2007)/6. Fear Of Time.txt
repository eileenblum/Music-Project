I watched the moon destroy the sun while blindness tried to see
Silver rays of better days came shining down on me

Fear of time destroys your peace of mind

I felt my earth become a dream of insecurity
Close my eyes inside there lies my failing memory

Fear of time destroys your peace of mind

Free your mind in the sea of time
Free your mind from your fear of time

Dust to dust the endlessness destroys my sanity
Take me home where I can roam for all eternity

Fear of time destroys your peace of mind

Clear your mind in the sea of time
Iâm free now, so free now
To see how mindless is my fear of time
I walk alone, Iâm coming home
And all I leave you is my fear of time

Iâve got no time to live a lie or question what I see
Swallowing this evil thing thatâs feeding off of me

Fear of time destroys your peace of mind

Clear your mind in the sea of time
Iâm free now, so free now
To see how mindless is my fear of time
I walk alone, Iâm coming home
And, all I leave you is my fear of time
Iâm free now, so free now
To see how mindless is my fear of time
