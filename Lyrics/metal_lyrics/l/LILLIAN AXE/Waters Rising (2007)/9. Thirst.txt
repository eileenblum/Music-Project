Wet me, wet my lips, a slow degeneration
Find me solutions for all my aggravations
Fill me, fill my space, with anything of substance
Empty I canât survive, a hollow cave inside

Help me, fire the mindless
Reason, gonna let them free
Whatâs it gonna be?
Hire the shameless
Treason, make them follow me
So I can feed my soul

If you see me in the morning
Lay me down and gather what you need
Move so slow you hardly make a sound
Quench my thirst, and make my passion bleed

Kiss me, wet my face, release my savage lust
Drive me forever to give you sacred trust
Empty, climb inside, absorbing all I witness
So much more I need to know
Iâm feeding way too slow

Breathe slow, searching forever
Breathe deep, need to know it all
Never gonna end, infinite wisdom
Teach me, gonna melt my mind
So I can feed my soul

If you see me in the morning
Lay me down and soak up what you need
Move so slow you hardly make a sound
Quench my thirst, and make my passion bleed

Seems Iâve lost my will today
My skin is way too tight to stay
All eyes on me, just let me be
So I can feed my soul

If you see me in the morning
Lay me down and suck up what you need
Move so slow you hardly make a sound
Quench my thirst, and make my passion bleed

Fire the mindless, help me
Save us, fuck all the mindless
