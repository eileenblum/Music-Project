Angels come to earn their wings
Shield me from the pain I hold so tight
They seem so invisible
The blind canât read without their light
And then the darkness came and cluttered up my kindness game
While everyone said, âKeep a smile,
And sweep your hurt beneath the tile, and bow to meâ

Clipped of wings and forced to fly
All my trust naÃ¯ve weighs me down
And like a child deflected sight
Deaf ears canât hear the killing sounds
Robbed of all my sanity
The norm was mediocrity
And wise men fell from pedestals
The weak made goblets from their skulls
And came for me

Now, before I go
Iâll let you know a secret
Then maybe you will understand
Staring deep into your soul
I thought could make the torture go
But, it seems love never can

Free, roll out to the sea
Martyr out of me
As I sail crucified
Bleed, taking of my seed
Kiss me, turn and leave
I have to die, goodbye

Lost my faith so long ago
The worthy come, the worthy go to sleep
Resting far beyond the lies they keep
On my tongue a thousand tears
A burning hate that reappears in me
So now you turn to me, my friend
To try to make me heed my own words
It doesnât work that way
It comes my time, reach ladders I canât climb
Iâll take another way

Free, roll out to the sea
Martyr out of me
As I sail crucified
Bleed, taking of my seed
Kiss me, turn and leave
I have to die, goodbye

Angels come to earn their wings
Where were they when I thought I could fly?
But they remain invisible and
Wonder why we lose our will to fight
Still now the darkness comes
We close the shades, avoid, be numb
But, through the cracks, beneath the door
It finds a way, become its whore
So lay with me
Away with me

Free, roll out to the sea
Martyr out of me
As I sail crucified
Bleed, taking of my seed
Kiss me, turn and leave
I have to die, goodbye
