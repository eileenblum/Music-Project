(Whoa!)

It's the same old aggrevation
Undercover love is still a sin (That's right)
I just can't deal with complication
I'm givin' up I'm givin' in

You slipped right through my fingertips
You're just too hard to please

[Chorus:]
I'm rainin' down on you
Down on the pain that you put me through
Been up and down with you
Down on the love that I thought so true

Oh, it's an impossible situation
Been pushed every way but your direction (No, no)

You stuck a knife in my achin' heart
Then left me here to bleed

[Chorus]

Down, down, down on you
Down, down, down, down on you

[Solo]

(Aw, I've had enough of this)
Ow!

You slipped right through my fingertips
Was I too hard to please?

[Chorus]

Down, down, down on you
Down, down, down, down on you
Down, down, down on you
Down, down, down, down on you
