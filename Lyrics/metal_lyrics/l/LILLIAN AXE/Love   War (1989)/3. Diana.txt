Come with me my sweet Diana
I'll show you things you've never seen before
All your life you were upon a pedestal
Now it's time you get down on the floor

She's the girl I want my sweet Diana
She's got a lot of questions on her mind
She needs to know why everyday
It seems like everyone is so unkind, why, why, why

She always runs away my sweet Diana
Go into a place she knows quite well
She'll find escape in the Garden of Eden
Before too long she'll realize she's in hell

She's the girl I want my sweet Diana
She's got a lot of questions on her mind
She needs to know why everyday
It seems like everyone is so unkind, why, why, why

Come with me my sweet Diana
I'll give you love you never had before
Come with me my sweet Diana
I'll be your love forevermore

[Solo]

She needs to know why everyday
It seems like everyone is so unkind, why, why, why

Come with me my sweet Diana
I'll give you love you never had before
Come with me my sweet Diana
I'll be your love forevermore

Come with me my sweet Diana, (Come on, come on with me)
Come with me my sweet Diana (Take my hand by me, yeah)
Come with me my sweet Diana (I'll be your love)
I'll be your love forevermore

Come with me my sweet Diana
[Repeat]
