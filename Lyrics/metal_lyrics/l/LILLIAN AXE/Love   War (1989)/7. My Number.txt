What you see is what you get
The flavour stays the same.
(Hey you, over here)
(Lemme give you my number, Shh)

Ok!

You can offer assistance
You can even steal my car
Why, you can give me some distance
I bet you couldn't get far

And I could show you to my mother
You're just my mama's kind (Mama's kind)
Mama this girl's my lover
She's really one of a kind a kind (A kind)

Well, you could sit here
Make me happy never sad
I wouldn't mind if you don't mind feelin' bad
Too bad

Why, you could play my trusty organ
Or we could make it on the floor (On the floor)
Some bitches say I ignore them
That doesn't matter for sure (For sure)

And I won't write you foolish love songs
But you can bring me to your bed (To your bed)
Saw the good comes outta two wrongs
Hey girl I mean what I say I said (I said)

My eyes are tired
My back is stiff from what you done
It doesn't matter to me
I'm havin' lots of fun

[Solo]

You offered me no assistance
You couldn't even steal my car (My car)
And what about that distance
I said you wouldn't get far

Now I won't show you to my mother
You're not my mama's kind (Mama's kind)
Mama this girl's my lover
She loves to 69 all night (Whew!)

Why, you could sit here
Make me happy never sad
I wouldn't mind if you don't mind feelin' bad

Ahh
