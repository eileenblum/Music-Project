I'm not the kind of man
Who lets a woman tell me
Just what I can and cannot do.

She came prepared for battle
And all I had to say was
"I'd like to spend some time with you."

[Bridge:]
Comin' on shy but I don't know why
Sure knows what to do
Bitch gonna stab you in the back
While she makes love to you

[Chorus:]
All's Fair in Love and War
So what are we fighting for
All's Fair in Love and War

No one to blame but yourself
There's no more lies left to tell
You know I've heard that song before

Now you're too scared to face me
Afraid of what you may see
How all is fair in love and war.

[Bridge - chorus - solo]

And when the battle's over
You'll find another love
I'll be another casualty.

[Bridge - chorus]
[Repeat]
