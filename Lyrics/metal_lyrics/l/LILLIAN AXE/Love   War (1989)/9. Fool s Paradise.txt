You say your happy, with your ways
But anyone who's ever known you knows that you've seen better days
So here's a lesson, to be learned
In a mirror, disillusioned, images you cannot turn

In a Fools Paradise
Will you ever realize
In a Fools Paradise
Oh...Oh

Another step in, the wrong direction
Never to return again, misery can be your friend
In your wasted dreams, nothings what it seems
Take a look at what you've done, cowards only shoot and run

In a Fools Paradise
Will you ever realize
In a Fools Paradise
It's all gonna come to an end

You think you're happy, maybe just too high
All you love's been lost in dreams and don't you ever wonder why
Tomorrow's history, anyway do you care
You can run forever but your getting nowhere

In a Fools Paradise
Will you ever realize
In a Fools Paradise
Oh ... Oh
In a Fools Paradise
Will you ever open your eyes
In a Fools Paradise
It's all gonna come to an end
