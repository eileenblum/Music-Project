As I looked into the stormy night
The scheme of all things came to be
The fire weapon started burning
Your cheating ways I came to see

Cause when the moonlight hit the water
I've had your sweet lips on my brain
Then I found the truth in writing
I read your Letters In The Rain
In the rain

Now I spend my nights in firelight
I look into the flames for hope
The rain it brings back all the memories
Then in the winter turns to snow

Cause when the moonlight hit the water
I've had your sweet lips on my brain
Then I found the truth in writing
I read your Letters In The Rain
In the rain

[solo]

Now you come back with this story
Of how you made a big mistake
Do you expect me to believe you
Too bad I won't give you a break
Not this time

Cause when the moonlight hit the water
I've had your sweet lips on my brain
Then I found the truth in writing
I read your Letters In The Rain
In the rain In the rain In the rain
