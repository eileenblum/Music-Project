So you feel a little lonely girl
Well you know you're used to that one
Now the taste of sweet success
Is on your lips, you always want some

Picture perfect innocence
Behind a guard that she can't drop
She's been around the world
Now she's back on the top

[Chorus:]
She wants everything put in her lap
Yeah she likes it on top
She's in the right place

Though all along you knew it was wrong
The taste of blood got to ya

Now everyone who's on your list
You know they gotta do something for ya

Not a care at her expense
She'll pay the piper when he stops
She's been around the world
Now she's back on the top

[Chorus]

She cries herself to sleep at night
It's not all it's cracked up to be
She Can't See, Yeah

She's a little lonely
Gets her kicks on top of the world

[Solo]

Picture Perfect Innocence
She'll pay the piper when he stops
She's been around the world
Now she's back on the top

[Chorus]
