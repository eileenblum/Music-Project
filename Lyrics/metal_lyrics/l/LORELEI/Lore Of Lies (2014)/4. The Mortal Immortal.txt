In this tale of a lost soul 
A tale of the tired and insane 
In this world of nothing 
Science has forgotten him and the world is moving on 
Cursed to love no one 
He can never die in vain 
He amounts to nothing 
As he stands alone because the world is fucking gone 

Is this how it ends? 
As he stands to fight a battle he can never win 
Is this how it ends? 
As he stands to fight a battle he can never win 
Tell me how it ends! 
Now he can reach the stars, for he is one of them 
A severed story of a false constellation 
Would turn back time with no hesitation 

What does this mean to me? 
A mindless tragedy. 
What will it take to free - 
My mind from insanity? 

Frozen in time 
Melting inside 
Too old to live 
Too young to die 
Do I pray to a god - 
Or just pray to me? 

From the brink my mind is severed 
For no one can truly live forever 
Forever... 

This is the story of the lost in a time where time is lost. 
The mortal immortal... 
Is he blessed, or is he cursed? 
To live for death is his only thirst! 
Doomed to wait, the end is near 
Left with nothing but his thoughts is the only thing he fears 

I stand along with my past looking back at me 
My future's dim and I've seen all there is to see 
I'd take it back just to rewrite history 
But now it's gone and I'm stuck with my misery 

Commoners in the life we waste away 
The world crumbles, you stay the same 
To live forever is a hard thing to bear 
Mortal immortal, your end is near
