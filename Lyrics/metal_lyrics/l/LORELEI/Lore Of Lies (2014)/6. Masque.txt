Welcome to the masquerade! 

This isn't the end 
A dance we begin 
I am sent from the night 
You can't hide from the blight 
I will follow you now 
Your refuge has failed 
And darkness prevailed 

O, Prospero! 
Where will I lead thee now? 

Red wind flows swiftly through the vine 
What is a curse holds true to what's divine 
I am the walking plague sent in disguise 
And in the seventh room, all will be mine 

I see the hearse in the twisted eyes 
Of the man who led me here 

I hold the curse to the fall of man 
I speak of myself 
To speak of me 
Will bring terror 
I hold the fate of every man 
I speak of the plague 
To speak of it 
Will surely bring terror 

Silence! 
Run to the hills 
Tonight 
Blood will spill 

"And darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all.."
