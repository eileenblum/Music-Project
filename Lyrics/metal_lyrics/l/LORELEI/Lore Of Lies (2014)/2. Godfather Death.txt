In this land of dissolving fiends 
I am Godfather Death 
By prostration 

And in this land of callous deeds, 
Here I reign 
Here I reign... 

Conquered by venom, you're the evil that's within him 
And my bidding is the truth, you are the lie 
Sent by the father to demand the mother's daughter 
Bring her to me, for she is mine! 

Enter 
The very darkness that made you blind 
I am your mentor 
But you've betrayed me for the last time 
Decide 
Your fate is nothing predetermined 
I am beside 
Every bed lit by the devil's flame 

I am 
Watching your every move 
You can't hide from death 
Look in the mirror 
Do you see yourself or me? 

And when your candles burn to none 
Just know your journey's just begun 
And then you'll see what you have done 
Fuck with death and you are gone 

Death, no longer 
Gods, I'm stronger
