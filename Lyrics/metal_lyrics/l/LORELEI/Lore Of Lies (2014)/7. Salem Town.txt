Take me 
To the darkest place on earth 
Drag me 
Through the stench that I am worth 
Save me 
Form the evil that I create 
Kill me 
Before everything goes to waste 

Streaming feverous creation 
Through limitless veins of black 
A failed creation 
A new legend beneath the cracks 

Corpses line the walls in the village 
And they watch them all as we sleep 
We dine on excrement in the buildings 
While the rats chew away at our feet 

Raise from the dead 
Hell's got a price on our head 
The devil's pact lasts forever 
We can't go unfed 

In Salem Town, we're sick and we're rotten 
And we're hungry for fear 
We will not be forgotten 

Enter the dreams that feed my sanity 
Enter my mind and all its vanity 

Follow the visions 
Of a madman who can't be stopped 
Now will you listen? 
This madness cannot be stopped! 

Construct their minds 
They will be mine 
Send them to him 
All will be mine 

Set fire to the village 
And in the night death will be witnessed 
Set fire to the village 
This is the night that we will end this 

I am the sick 
I am the rotten 
I am hungry for fear 
I will not be forgotten 

Sent to our realm... 
Sent from the underworld...
