A beast so vile, you can feel him breathing on you 
Staring at you, his eyes are eclipsed 

An abomination 
Was he left here, or just made here? 
I can feel him at my doorstep 

Killing gently 
Oh so swiftly 
Abruptly ending journal entries 
Hints at death 

An abomination 
Was he left here, or just made here? 
I can smell his rotting flesh 

Seeking vengeance for the curse he was fed 
Not of this world, but one of the dead 
Pray to your deity that tonight he's not feeding 
And that your children don't have the same fate 

Condemned to a life of misery 
From a time with no history 
Not bound to where he sleeps 
Yet he always returns to me 
Sent here from the very depths of hell 
Return to where you rest tonight 
And bid farewell... 

The taker of armies won't rest 'til the morning 
Rise up to your calling, be one with the fallen 
The horror is coming, so pack your belongings 
And go to hell! 

Under this city lies a hidden horror 
What do you want from me? 
Human torture 

As if the pain wasn't enough 
God damn 
I'm a mess 
When will this stop? 
I can't take it 
I'm near the edge 
Just dig a ditch 
And throw me in 
Fuck your gods, 
Who needs them anyway? 
Limbs sewn from the beast of another 
What is real and what is undiscovered 
Limbs sewn from the beast of another 
You'll be the last to witness the Dunwich Horror
