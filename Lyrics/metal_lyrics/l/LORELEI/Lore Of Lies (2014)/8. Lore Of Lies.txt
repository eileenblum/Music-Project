Sent down into a world of terror
You have been chosen
Agony is seeping into your soul
Murderers and villains
Terrorize your every thought
This is the last story you'll ever tell

The pen
The illustrations foretold
The words
The fear of being alone
The book
There's no hope of escaping
The end is awaiting

And as he wrote the fallacy
On pages ripped from his normality
And left him with a tragedy
Alone he'll whisper silently
And haunt what used to be his sanity
The lore is who I'll always be
So take my hand, come away with me

SAVE ME
Oh the horrors you will see
SAVE ME
Falling deeper into this world
SAVE ME
The forest thickens, the shadows grow
SAVE ME
Now there's nowhere else to go...

SAVE ME
Oh the horrors you will see
SAVE ME
Falling deeper into this world
SAVE ME
The forest thickens, the shadows grow
Don't judge a book by its cover
Stories last forever and now you know...

After all is said, you will know the reaping
You can't run or hide, constantly proceeding
After your demise, they will find you bleeding
Begging for your life, conquered by your feelings

[Ollie/Dave - Foreboding Ether]
Lately I've been by myself
Suffering with all of this agony
These words burnt in my mind
Begging for mercy
Falling in a helpless world of terror
I'd kill for some rest in my life
Take my hand, forget this place and let go
Cure my curse of horror
The mistake of reading intake
Has led me to spiral down this hole

LOST!
Please, someone trade with me
Or end this life of misery
It's my soul that you should see
The blackened...
The rotten...
The disgusting...
Reality.

[Adrian Perez - Warforged]
Feel insanity
This mind is of fire
Boiling blood from finger tips
Form sigils on the canvas

The chronicle of human emptiness
Scribe of a doomed tome

Spirits engulfing
Strewn of the pages
Fluttering wildly
My seared appendages
Draining the marrow
Of fantasy untold

The chronicle of human emptiness
Scribe of a doomed tome
SAVE ME
