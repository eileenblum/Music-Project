Again he'll find himself in silence and solitude, 
again he'll rise from land of sadness, 
again he'll begin to shine for your eyes.
Tears shall bear his inner beauty and noble soul 
and his body will come into flower by gorgeous aura.

His eyes shall fill you by energy,
his eyes shall permeate behind your walls
and your strongholds shall crash.
You will stand before him in your nakedness and
maybe then for the first time you will see it yourself.

But do not be afraid,
his eyes shall purify you
and the iced hearts of yours shall suck the rays of his Sun.

...and you'll hear the beautiful voice
and the purest words - the unspoken ones, 
you will comprehend real love
and awakened you'll weep....
