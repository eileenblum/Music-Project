Jealousy is degrading us from divine freedom to futile slavery.

Be free and let 'em be free.
Spiritual teachers we become when giving freedom
and possibility of choice.
Show 'em freedom and you'll be followed,
it's the only way leading from the painsphere.

[Chorus:] Then we will be a step closer to home

Improvement of ourselves is an escape from inner impurity and its torments.
So because we judge others according to ourselves
when there is no impurity within us
we won't be afraid of the impurity of others...

...and fear is gone, 
only beautiful harmony remains...

[Chorus:] Then we will be a step closer to home
