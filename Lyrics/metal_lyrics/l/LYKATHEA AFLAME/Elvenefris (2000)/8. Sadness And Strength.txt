You have pierced me, human being,
it wasn't for the first time and I believe it wasn't for the last time.
You even don't know it
but so often you are shedding my blood,
frequently I do not have the strength for you.
Then I retire into my palace veiled 
in the morning vesture of apathy.

Still I haven't found inside of you
what I am looking for a long time.
Silently I just beg this wasn't phantasm...

How much more shedded blood and tears is
awaiting before my soul comes home?
The eyes of mine sow the wistful
longing on the firmament.

I will give you mercy... even I am bleeding
Mercy and sympathy... the arms of the strong and longing ones.
When I advance on my way... I'll begin to pray for you.
