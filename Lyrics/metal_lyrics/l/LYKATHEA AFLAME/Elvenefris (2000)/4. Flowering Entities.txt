Any negative emotion as a response
for stimulus from envirous arisen in us
show us that we are still within power
of superficial dimension and teach us

Let's learn

As the Sun for the Earth let's become salavation
let creatures flower
and shine under the touches of beautiful energy
Perhaps it can't be seen
but they are starving and thirsty; they're eager

As a mirror light let's reflect negativity 
and show pure reality
let's become the islands of peace and harmony
in that vast ocean of discomposure and disharmony

and let the tired ones rest
