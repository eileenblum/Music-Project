Revived in Lykathea, in that exhausting and
dazing embrace, discomposure entered me.
And I opened my heart and beared the yearning
and the wish buried from the light for aeons.

I felt connection and allurement that I will not withstand.
I awakened to Elvenefris and heard the calling.

The gate will be found, 
the key will be forged.

My heart I will present to you being cleared 
of a poisons of Lykathea that exorcise us to idleness
and condemn us to pain.

I am searching for the land where I will fall on my knees
and will be weeping for a long time.
Where my mind shall extend on the sky
and my heart shall speak the language of the trees
and open like a water-lily
by touches of morning sun...
