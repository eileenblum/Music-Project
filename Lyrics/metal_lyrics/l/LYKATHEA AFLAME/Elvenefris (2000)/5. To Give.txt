Gifts you give others - surely the same ones return to you, 
therefore think how oyu present others,
since the good when you give - by that time you are presented
and if the evil being your gift - by that time you are punished.

Since the eyes watching over the life are never closing.

How much pain do you need yet?
Since the way is being shown to you 
and indeed only the closed eyes do not see it.
