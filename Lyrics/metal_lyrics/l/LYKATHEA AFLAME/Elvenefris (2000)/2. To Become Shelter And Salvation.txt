I am not able to tell you by words what I feel.... anymore.
To become shelter and salvation
To become shelter and salvation
Those so magnificent loveful waves reach far beyond the shore of my body.

I weep for the pain I have ever caused you even I know
it is the teacher leading us towards the light.
Learn to read from the eyes - they are the open gates to heart.

The waves of so magnificent loveful energy are flowing through and among
my fingers and my body is bathing in that purifying bath.

I wish to become shelter and salvation...
