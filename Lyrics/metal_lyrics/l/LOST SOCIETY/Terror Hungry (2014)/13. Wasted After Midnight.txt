Let's go, UH!

WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT

Crawling into another bed
At night
Oh once again I'm wasted
Out of my fucking mind

WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT

Once again I took this one
Inch too far
Cocked and loaded in the
Wrong way my only
Memory is a scar
But I'm fine as long I got
Myself intact
But you know when you're
Really shit outta luck
When all you can scream is
JESUS FUCK!
WAAASTEEEEED!

SHOT! SHOT!
This monster is taking over me
SHOT! SHOT!
Making me show my own brutality
SHOT! SHOT!
The big F is looking kinda small
SHOT! SHOT!
Why do you do this to me alcohol?!

Is it worth is after all, YES
What's the point of it all
This is my habit, can't stop just gotta have it

Blackout, pass out
I don't care what you do, just keep 'em coming or
I'll come after you!

I'm coming there, destination I don't care
I've lost the last of my luck and I've lost my will
To give a fuuuuuck

WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT
WASTED AFTER MIDNIGHT

Oh no I guess it's time to say my last goodbyes
Open my eyes and see what I woke up next to
This time
Now I know I really can't get any lower
Until the next time I say, HEY GUYS! LET'S TAKE THIS OVER!
