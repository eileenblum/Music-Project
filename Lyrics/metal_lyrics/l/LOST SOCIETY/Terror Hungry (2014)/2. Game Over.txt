Look me in the eyes and tell me
Tell me everything that you know
I will be the last thing you'll ever see
So remember to say bye bye
Fear is the key, throughout eternity
Life has fucked you well
You had a good run, I think you can tell
Now let me introduce you the burning pit of hell

Face it, mean it, tonight I will come after you
I get what I want and tonight, I ain't gonna lose
GAME OVER
GAME OVER
GAME OVER
GAME OVER

Consider me your black hooded savior
Down with me is where you belong
Your story will end, time to go to bed
To the never ending journey from the living to the dead

Face it, mean it, tonight I will come after you
I get what I want and tonight, I ain't gonna lose
This time it ain't easy, but some things I just got to do
Just close your eyes, soon you'll be through

[Chorus]

[Solos]

[Chorus]
