OH!

Driving like a maniac
Prepare for the attack
I scream, you scream
All for death

There's no way out
This car is taking me alive
Everyone's screaming high
We're all gonna die

SNOWROAD
BLOWOUT
WATCH OUT
The end is near
SNOWROAD
BLOWOUT
CRASH AND BURN

OH!
OH!

Speed bumps on the way
Looks like I'm gonna die today
Put your fatal smile on
For a nasty hit

[Chorus]

[Solos]

LET IT GO!
