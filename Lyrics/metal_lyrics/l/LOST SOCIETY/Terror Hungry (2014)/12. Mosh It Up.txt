Morning 'til the evening, louder than death
We're doing it, faster than anyone else
Blazing through the notes like through an open road
Heads are gonna bang and heads are gonna roll LIKE FUCK
Ripping it bad time, we're crazy as fuck
Tell us to go home, you're shit outta luck
The storm's coming near as we're getting near
We make the underground tremble in fear
And we're ready to EXPLODE!

THRASH!

Put your fists up in the air, IN THE AIR!
You're with us now, and we don't care
This is our style, this is our way oh
A fistful of energy, coming at your way UH

MOSH IT UP!
MOSH IT UP!
MOSH IT UP!
MOSH IT UP! MOSH IT UP!

[Solo]

Speeding with a 100 miles on the clock
Aiming so high with no chance for a stop
Outta my way, gonna go 'til I die
Tongue in cheek all the way 'til I fry
Booze, bitches, thrash, oh where do I start?
Terror hungry maniacs is what we are
Drink up or lie down, you got no chance
If you don't agree you can kiss my ass

Put your fists up in the air, in the air
You're with us now, and we don't care
This is our life, that is our way oh
A fistful of energy coming at your way, OOH FUCK!

[Chorus]

[Solos]

[Chorus]
