UUH FUCK!

Until you rest in peace my rage comes with a fist

You wake me from the grave, now I will strike again
The curse you put on me will show
Anger and hatred you know nothing about
Now watch this motherfucker blow, Fuck!
UNDERGROUND, I'll drag you down
Your last rights in my hand
Just try and run and hide, I'll find you

My brain grew ravenous
I feed on guts and flesh
This time it is my turn
This time I'll make you burn
UH
REST IN PISS!

You're always only thinking about retribution
You're always only thinking about retribution
How 'bout you pull your head out of your ass
And think of a solution
It's just whine, with you, no answer
I tried to die but still couldn't get rid of you
You thought I'd take it and run, no point at all
Get back in line bitch 'cause I am

ATTAXIC, space rage you can't hold back
ATTAXIC, this day I will strike back
ATTAXIC, space rage you can't hold back
ATTAXIC, this day I will attack

BURN!

[Solos]

Napalm breathing fatal coming
Napalm breathing fatal coming
Retribution coming at you
I'm attaxic, WHAT THE FUCK DUDE, I'm attaxic OOOH
