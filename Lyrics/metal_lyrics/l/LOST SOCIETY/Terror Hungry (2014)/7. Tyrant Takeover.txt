Think of all the people you've been putting down
Broken, scarred, victims of the world
Chained to the scars inflicted on your soul
Building peace, not hell, for us all

Kneel down, and praise me for the choices I have done for you
Fear me, for I'll make myself a god
Burn my money, burn my face, go ahead and burn the entire race
Tyrant's coming tonight with the power
Kiss my ass

Things could be better, could be worse, suck it up 'til you're in the hearse
Stomp on me, punch my face, soon I'll count your fucking days
Hypocrisy, fortune and fame, for you I know it's just a game
I fought for you, it's just that, someday you'll meet my final attack

[Solo]

The tyrant takeover is coming
Showing us what you are
Rip me off and stab my back
You'll take us down with you

[Solo]

OH, my rights are lost, you are mine
TYRANT TAKEOVER
TYRANT TAKEOVER

[Solo]

The tyrant takeover is coming
Showing us what you are
Rip me off and stab my back
You'll take us down with you

[Solo]

You might as well just laugh back
TYRANT TAKEOVER
TYRANT TAKEOVER

BURN BITCH!

I warned you once, flipped you twice
Now you'll give me back all my rights
It's my turn now to be your god
Push your face down on the mud
My fury goes just on and on
Soon we'll make you gone
You chained me in to be your slave
Now I'll laugh all the way from your fucking grave!
