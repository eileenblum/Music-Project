GO!
UUUH FUCK!
GO!

Lost my job to a scholar, bought a beer with my last dollar
I think it's safe to say I might as well just go
Some things just don't change, no, oh throw me a fucking bone
It's 10 a.m., far too early to get stoned?!

I'm breaking out, LOUD AND CLEAR
You'll hear me fuckin' scream
Slave grinding TO THE LIMIT
My fate is clear

You know I've been, and I'll be
Fucked for, eternity, eternity, eternity
Fucked for eternity, eternity, eternity
Fuck you!
