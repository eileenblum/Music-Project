ONE, TWO, ONE TWO THREE FOUR
I'm a modern day asshole I got no job
Lost my car and my home to the mob
People feel sorry well fuck them all
You can push me down but I ain't gonna fall
All I got is left is this broken head
But fuck, it's not gonna keep me fed
This ain't rock bottom, hell, that'd be sweet
I'm a dog let loose in the big city
Oh

You know I'm hellhound
Well you can push me to the ground
You know I'm having a bad day
Sometimes I just wanna say

PISS OUT MY ASS
PISS OUT MY ASS
PISS OUT MY ASS
PISS OUT MY PISS OUT MY ASS
FUCK
MOTHERFUCKERS!
PISS OUT MY PISS OUT MY ASS
