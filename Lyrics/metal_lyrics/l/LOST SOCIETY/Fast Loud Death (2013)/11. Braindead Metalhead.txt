I wake up and put my stake knife on the table
Gotta find my way out of this hell
I gotta get my groove on and figure out how
To make myself clear
I gotta make myself, I gotta make myself, I gotta make myself clear
Alright, OH

I put my guitar on my back
And get my axe from my sack
I gotta get my groove on and figure out how
To make myself clear
I gotta make myself, I gotta make myself, I gotta make myself clear
