GO!
DIE!

After years of this pain I can finally say that I'm done playing your fucking games
You have put me through more than I can ever imagine, now it's got to end
You tell me when to laugh but you won't tell me why, do you get all your kicks off of me
But either laughing or crying or even my dying, it's life after all, isn't it

Fighting, dying, you've got to choose, LIVE OR DIE
Fighting, dying, the choice is yours, FAST LOUD DEATH

Fighting, dying, you've got to choose, LIVE OR DIE
Fighting, dying, the choice is yours, FAST LOUD DEATH
OH!
