Skin the welfare to the bone
Look around you, you will know
Sleep with a gun in your hand
Or get buried in the sand
Fell me fucking up your mind
Everyday and all the time
You're really shit outta luck, now burn in hell
You ugly fuck
It's a filthy rotten life
Kill the children, beat the wife
Put a bullet to their head, 'til they're nice and dead
Fear the violence, love the gun
Pull the trigger then you'll run
Cowards leave all as one leaving their job undone

I got one thing to say, motherfuckers
KILL, those who oppose me
KILL, those who deny me
KILL, those out to get me
KILL, those who oppose me

You think you're better than me
I respect your honesty
Now listen, go home and cry
How 'bout you fucking die

My pleasure is your pain
How long 'til you go insane
I'll stab you in the back
Don't you know I'm a maniac
Doublecross me, that's okay
Just say it to my face
Well bitch this is your fate
I'll see you in the grave

I got one thing to say, motherfuckers
KILL, those who oppose me
KILL, those who deny me
KILL, those out to get me
KILL, those who oppose me

You think you are my boss
Well that's your fucking loss
You think you are my friend
Well think again

I got one thing to say, motherfuckers
KILL, those who oppose me
KILL, those who deny me
KILL, those out to get me
KILL, those who oppose me

DIE
