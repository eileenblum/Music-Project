I lie awake here at 3 a.m.
I'm just wondering where the fuck I am
Out of this all, oh what's the cost
A deadbeat me, but at least I'm lost
OH!
GO!
I'm coming at you with a bottle full of power
It's enough to make you mine forever
Oh you get higher once I control your mind
Say bye bye to the world as you
get yourself lost
Wasted
Naked
Wasted
OH!
NAKED WASTED LOST!
