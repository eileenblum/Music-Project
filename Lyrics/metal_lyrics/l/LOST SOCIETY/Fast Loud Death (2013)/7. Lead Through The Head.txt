OH!
Oh welcome to the world where freedom gets you nowhere
Try to find a way out now
Oh speak your mind if it is what I want to hear
We've been pushed down to only fear
Oh that's the way it goes
You got nothing anymore
No gain, pain is pain

Give me lead through my head
Give me lead through my head
Free me or put me to rest
Give me lead through my head

You haven't even thought, what's happening in your mind
You've created a fucking hell on earth
Oh fuck you all, that's what you think 'ay
I'd blow your brains out anyway
Oh that's the way it goes
You got nothing anymore
No gain,  just pain
OH!

Give me lead through my head
Give me lead through my head
Free me or put me to rest
Give me lead through my head

Give me lead through the head
Give me lead through the head
Give me lead through the head
TO THE HEAD
