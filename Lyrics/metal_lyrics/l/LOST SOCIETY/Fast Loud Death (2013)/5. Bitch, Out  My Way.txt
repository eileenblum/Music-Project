I'm sick of all your shit and I'm leaving this house
Forever you know
16 years of bullshit and a lot more to come
My foot will be printed up your ass

This is forever so you know, GO

I'm speeding down, bitch out' my way
I'm flying high, bitch out' my way

I'm grabbing my board and I'm leaving this town
Doing thousand miles an hour
Bitch you've been cranking my style for too long
This is the day and this is the outcome

I told you once and I'll tell you once again
This is the day, and this is what I say, alright

I'm speeding down, bitch out' my way
I'm flying high, bitch out' my way

You know, you know I've had enough, cause I got one thing to say to you, FUCK YOU

I'm speeding down, bitch out' my way
I'm flying high, bitch out' my way
I'm letting loose, bitch out' my way
I'm leaving you, bitch out' my way, bitch out' my way, bitch out' my way
