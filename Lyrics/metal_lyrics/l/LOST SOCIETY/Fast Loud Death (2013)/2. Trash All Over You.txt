You ready to hear the truth about all your lies
Let's play a little game, where the price is to be free
Where the world's up for grabs and you're my enemy
THIS IS WAR

TRASH ALL OVER YOU
TRASH ALL OVER YOU

I'm gonna say all the things I've always wanted to say
fuck the leaders, the haters, fuck all those who can't be true
You thought you knew me, these are my true colours
The colours of the flag I fight for me and you
GO

Look me in the eye and tell me this ain't a waste of time
Now it's just you and me, guilty as can be

TRASH ALL OVER YOU
TRASH ALL OVER YOU
TRASH ALL OVER YOU
TRASH ALL OVER YOU
