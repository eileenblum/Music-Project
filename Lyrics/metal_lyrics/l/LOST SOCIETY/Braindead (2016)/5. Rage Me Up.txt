Rage me up !

Gather up and stand your ground to the voice of our humanity
Give a shout to the man who's pulling you down and a finger to your policies
We are here to beer you up, send a message to the authorities
Stay away for today if you don't wanna play
Get your drink on bitch and scream with me

It's a cut throat world slittin' us apart
Tear, tear, tear it up
Continuous ending from the start
Rip, rip, rip it up
Fuck your terms, raise hell with me
Blaze, blaze, blaze it up
All we need is anarchy!

Pound your drinks and scream with me
This is the new society
Down with power, up with me
It's time for a catastrophe
Now listen

Rage me up, rage me up
Rebel against the world
Rage me up, rage me up, rage me up

It's a cut throat world slittin' us apart
Tear, tear, tear it up
Continuous ending from the start
Rip, rip, rip it up
Fuck your terms, raise hell with me
Blaze, blaze, blaze it up
All we need is anarchy!

Fuel my fire up
Take cover and get ready
We're thrashing over you going city to city
A mental hit and run
Celebrating freedom
We'll put you in your face
It will be the fucking bomb

Tears this place up
It's time to riot
Forget your distress
It's thrashing madness
