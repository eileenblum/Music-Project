Enough's enough we're living in an illusion
It's time it's time for a revolution
We're broken down don't even try to hide it
Raise your fists up high and start a fuckin' riot!
Enough's enough we're living in an illusion
It's time it's time for a revolution
We're broken down don't even try to hide it
Raise your fists up high and start a fuckin' riot!
You'll never silence me
You and your heresy
Sound the sirens, now it's on
We're here and we belong
If you wanna scream, well, I'll scream
If you wanna fight, well, I'll fight
We are the ones who'll rise back on top
We are the ones who don't give a fuck
Tune in to the sound of the future
We're moving and we won't go back
We're living proof of a world that has left us dead
This isn't the sound of us giving up
This is the power of a new start
What's right don't mean shit to me
We got nothing to lose but everything to gain
Point your fingers elsewhere if you want the truth
It could be me but I'm sure it's you
Say goodbye to what was safe today
We're gonna break the fuck away
Break away!
Be a part of us or against us all
Together we rise, together we fall
If you wanna justify yourself
I won't give up my rights
Now!
It's time to disobey
abolish tyranny
Time to
Time to
Time to riot!
Time to riot!
Get the fuck up and riot!
Time to riot!
You wanna question me? How 'bout I question you?
Who the fuck needs me?
Who the hell needs you?
It's time to rise
We're coming after you!
Who the fuck needs me?
Who the hell needs you?
It's time to rise
We're coming after you!
RIOT! Who the fuck needs me?
RIOT! Who the hell needs you?
RIOT! It's time to rise
RIOT! We're coming after you!
RIOT! Who the fuck needs me?
RIOT! Who the hell needs you?
RIOT! It's time to rise
RIOT! We're coming after you!

[Guitar solo]

You'll never silence me
you and your heresy
Sound the sirens, now it's on
Riot!
