Carve my eyes out and clean me of my sins
This is the place where evil dies and torture begins
I've seen it all and I don't mess with my fate
I've lost everything but I still got my hate

Behind my hollow eyes
I'm just a creature trying to survive
My blood that runs inside
Getting colder 'til the day I die

We live just to die and we try to justify
The bottomless pit of our soulless lies
Pull my eyes and feed them to the weakest of the weak
I've seen the past, the future, but what the fuck does it mean to me 

Behind my hollow eyes
I'm just a creature trying to survive
My blood that runs inside
Getting colder 'til the day I die

Burn!

The tears that we all cry
Are as dark as the lies we deny
I hope the things that you would die for
Are worth it in the end

Behind my hollow eyes!

I'm lost without a place to call my own
I'm lost without a place to call my home
Look behind my eyes and tell me what you see
A soul without a reason to be

What if this is what you call hell
And what if I'm doomed to live forever
Nothing can save me
Nobody can break me
I've already perished
Behind my hollow eyes
Behind my hollow eyes
Behind my hollow eyes
