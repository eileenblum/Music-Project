You denied your own ignorance
You are victim of your arrogance
You believed your own lies
You promised that you would arise
A false prophet, a fraud
A self-proclaimed god
Now you left us to decide
Between you or suicide

One single thing that I failed to see
Is that you would surely be the death on me
A greed infested, unholy creation
With a filthy need for domination
Go!

Now do you see where we all stand
Say your prayers and repent
The lakes of blood you left behind
Are as red as the tears we cry
I'm who you dream of every night
I'm the one you can't deny
Our innocence is lost
After we're born to die

I could leave you all well and not destroyed
But I think I'm just a little bit too paranoid
A greed infested , unholy creation
With a filthy need for domination

You've burned yourselves
Down to the ground
With all your bridges burnt down
You've burned yourselves
Down to the ground
Just know that I am the antidote

I'm here to put you on your knees
A needless act of tyranny
Before you come to hell with me

You've burned yourselves
Down to the ground
With all your bridges burnt down
You've burned yourselves
Down to the ground
Just know that I am the antidote
