I'm here again and the night goes by so very slow
I know that I'm trapped but I'm not here alone
Shaking in fear, what is happening to me?
I've been here before

Lost in a mind, out of time
Trying to survive
Out of the black, out of the dark
Just before I fall
Help me wake up, I am out of time
Or else I'll lose my mind

I am torn within
My fears are breaking me down
My sins are tearing me
Further apart each night
Where will I end up this time
Or is this it for me
I'm taking my last breathes, my last breathes

I've been
Fading away creating my own disaster
Drowning in sleep and my dreams are my grave
Trapped in the black I won't last much longer
I wonder if this really is the end of me
I've been waiting for the day when it all goes away
My fears are catching up to me and I'm getting nearer
I can't close my eyes, cause only then I'll realize
All I know is that only my death is certain

Die!

I was and I will be
Forgotten for eternity
Shadows faded away
Reflections gone

Was I alive at all
Or was I just invisible
It's getting clear to me
What I will be

I've been
Fading away creating my own disaster
Drowning in sleep and my dreams are my grave
Trapped in the black I won't last much longer
I wonder if this really is the end of me
I've been waiting for the day when it all goes away
My fears are catching up to me and I'm getting nearer
I can't close my eyes, cause only then I'll realize
All I know is that only my death is certain
