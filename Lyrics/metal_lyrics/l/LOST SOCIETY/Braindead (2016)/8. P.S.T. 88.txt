[originally by Pantera]Pussy tight
Tonight
Pussy tight

Just keep it coming
Just keep me pleased
If you know whats good for you
You'll be looking for me, I know you know I can please
Oh yes last night was crazy
Got in a fight
Saturday night
But tonight
Daddy's gonna make it right, slip and dance with me all night

Pussy Tight
Tonight
Pussy tight
All night!

Coors light on ice
She's getting right
She's feeling my rise
Don't stop roll the dice
She's got my rod in her thighs
Oh yes tonight feels crazy
Open the tight you know I might
Call me at day I can't fuckin' wait!
That's suppose to feels like I can handle all right?

Pussy tight
Tonight
Pussy tight
