Go!
Welcome to the place where you don't exist
All you get, you'll be tortured to bits
Screaming won't help, it'll only make it worse
He's painfully rusty, you're going first
You ain't getting out
I'll be getting in
A blade inside you
It'll wash your sins away
You ain't getting out
I'll be cutting in
A blade inside you
You will die in style
He's out for a minute, you think you're safe
Soon he comes back with a bigger fucking blade
Blinding pain just time and time again
Crying for mercy you're going insane
Gore after gore it's such a bloody scene
Nothing could be worse than what you're in
Fear and horror is never a solution
This is purely retribution
Mad torture! A fatal icontusion
Mad torture! Lethal brain intrusion
Mad torture! Carved to perfection
Mad torture! Before your lethal injection
Mad torture! A fatal icontusion
Mad torture! Lethal brain intrusion
Mad torture! Carved to perfection
Mad torture! Before your lethal injection
Tear 'em up deep, give them what they deserve
Make them beg to return
Your rights have been read
You will end up dead
Tear 'em up deep, give them what they deserve
Make them beg to return
Your rights have been read
Burn!
Go!
Mad torture! A fatal icontusion
Mad torture! Lethal brain intrusion
Mad torture! Carved to perfection
Mad torture! Before your lethal injection
Mad torture! Mad torture
Burn in hell motherfucker!
Mad torture!
