Rundown and feeling like I'm buried alive
My face tells a story of a man dead inside
The showdown of yesterday I'm blown out again
The truth: I don't feel like a perfect ten

Drinking and gambling
Fighting and babbling
The lesson I've learned but do not accept

It's the hangover activator
Activator
It's the hungover activator!

I lost it, it costs but I've been here before
Voices are telling me I need some more
Dealing with it, I'm trying to survive
If it doesn't work out I can always die

Eins, zwei, drei, vier!

Activator
