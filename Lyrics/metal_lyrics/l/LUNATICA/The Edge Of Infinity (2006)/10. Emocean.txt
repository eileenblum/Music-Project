The deep blue sea attracts my senses
The tide is like the heartbeat of eternity
I feel warm and safe as I'm diving deeper
Into the heart of the ocean, I have no fear

Beauty and wisdom are surrounding me here
Aren't we the ones who try to ignore?

[Chorus:]
Why I've never felt like this before? Oh, I cannot say!
It's pulling me deeper
It feels like going home to my fathers
I feel like a child in this deep blue wilderness

What I used to be is not important
I feel that something has changed inside myself
I breathe easily inside this liquid life
A total synthesis, immortality

Beauty and wisdom are surrounding me here
Aren't we the ones who try to ignore?

[Chorus]

Forever free is what I could be if I stayed here
With no idea of human greed I would play my part

I escape from everything that I know as I'm drifting within this flow
Let me go to where I belong! Listen to the waves, they're singing our song
