Control the power, leave the ground
As fast as an arrow up to the clouds, into the sky
Man and machine are becoming one
A perfect day for changing the face of the world

[Chorus:]
Go for glory, for hope and for God
They break the clouds, reach for the sky
Like hunters in an ancient story
They are the brave sons of the wind

Become a hero, pay the price
The need for speed is overwhelming your heart
The harvest of honour has begun
Live for the moment, leave all your worries behind

[Chorus]
