Once in a lifetime you'll reach a point
Where being a slave is no longer enough
Now the time has come to break your chains
Speak your mind, go straight ahead

[Chorus:]
Feel free to speak, don't deny yourself
The rights you have got
See that the life you've been leading is wrong
Unleash these words

Career and politeness are like a cage
For a long time you've thrown away your life
Take whatever you need, don't lose your faith
Terminate the times of diplomacy

[Chorus]

Unleash these words and live
