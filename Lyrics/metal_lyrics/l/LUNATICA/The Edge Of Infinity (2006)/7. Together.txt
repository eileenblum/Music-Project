We stand invincible
Real heroes
We're indestructible
Raise your swords

We are the last real knights
Full armour
We raise our banner high
Fast riders

[Chorus:]
Side by side we'll face the threat
In this hostile foreign land
It's the calm before the storm
The dawn before the battle's won
It's the mind that cannot sleep
It's the wish that goes so deep
Never weary, never quiet
It's the last night before we fight

We'll face the enemy
Together
The horns are calling out to the
Strong fighters

[Chorus]

Side by side, together, real heroes
