Infinity

What does it mean to you?

It can signify the point at which you leave reality behind.

Or it may just be a mathematical expression to describe the size of our universe.

It can symbolize that true love never dies (is immortal).

In other words, infinity offers you the chance that you'll find at last what you've always been dreaming of.

Hasn't it always been the endeavour of mankind to create a better world than the one we are living in?

Music gives you the chance to broaden your mind.

It's time to forget about the artificial frontiers that our intellect is inflicting on us.

Prepare yourself for the greatest journey you've ever made.

Dream on until you've reached the edge of infinity.
