When the first light of morning is touching the leaves
and the dewdrops are sparkling like stars
I feel the touch of a mild breeze caressing my skin
as I'm running to reach your strong arms

[Chorus:]
What greater gift could I get to feel alive
than the power of love in your eyes
Like a blooming rose in a barren place
that must absorb the falling rain
I am longing for your warm embrace

On my way through the forest I can hear a soft voice
But inside my heart it feels strong
It tells me to follow so I don't hesitate
It will lead me to where I belong

[Chorus]
