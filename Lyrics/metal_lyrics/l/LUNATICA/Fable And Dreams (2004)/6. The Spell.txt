Listen to me and you'll meet your fate
My voice is so sweet, it won't let you escape

Can't stop now, it's kicking my brain
Can't stop now, I'm loosing my brain

Open your mind, let me guide you, my dear
Once in these arms, you'll be free from your fears

Can't stop now, it's kicking my brain
Can't stop now, I'm loosing my brain

In every dream, I will appear
I sow the seed in your heart
So here I am, naked and free
A sirens fate is to be falling from grace

I'm all alone, I need you by my side
Since my eyes have caught you it's too late to hide

Can't stop now, it's kicking my brain
Can't stop now, I'm loosing my brain

In every dream, I will appear
I sow the seed in your heart
So here I am, naked and free
A sirens fate is to be falling from grace

Thousands I saw pass, not able to resist my call, desire hurts
Will and lust combined to poetry, one day a story will tell the truth

In every dream, I will appear
I sow the seed in your heart
So here I am, naked and free
A sirens fate is to be falling from grace
