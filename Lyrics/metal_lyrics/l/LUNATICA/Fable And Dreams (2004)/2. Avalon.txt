Avalon - mystified island, heart of Britannia
Place of my childhood, core of my memory
Avalon - beloved sisters, waiting for me
Forget all my sins, renew virginity

Awaiting the sunset on this lonely shore
Home, a strange word in my mouth
I call on the winds to lead me through the veiling mists
To reach my motherland in the dawn
Avalon

Avalon - faith of a kingdom, changed by my hand
A traitor's love I was, unleashing the storm
Avalon - welcome your daughter, swallow my guilt
I'll find absolution and fight back my tears

Awaiting the sunset on this lonely shore
Home, a strange word in my mouth
I call on the winds to lead me through the veiling mists
To reach my motherland in the dawn
Avalon

Avalon
