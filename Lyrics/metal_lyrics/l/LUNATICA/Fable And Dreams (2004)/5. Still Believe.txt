Look into my eyes, you will find
And ocean of love and of light
Deep inside, inside my eyes

Because one heart can never beat alone
And at the end you will share a dream
And it will be mine too

Still believe, ever believe
You are strong enough within yourself
Because life is an endless dream
And at the end we will be heroes

Once in history you will find
A soul equal to yours, to share a lifetime with
To count the stars

Fortune is a rare thing, grab it
And make your day
Because you'll never get a second chance

Still believe, ever believe
You are strong enough within yourself
Because life is an endless dream
And at the end we will be heroes
