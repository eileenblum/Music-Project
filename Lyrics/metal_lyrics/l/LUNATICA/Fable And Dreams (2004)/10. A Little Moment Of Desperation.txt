Hoping and praying I pass through these days
And I am trying not to lose myself
Is this the end or will I finally get
The answer from you that could hurt or heal?

Longing for the sun I try to remember
The days when everything began
How can the world just go ahead and turn
Around the sun, as if my worries didn't exist

Light in my life, I want to keep this moment
While the night keeps us alive
Desolation lies beneath euphoria
It's a constant living on the edge

Fearless I was once, my strength has turned
Into the weakness that the heartless own
And every fallen word seems to hurt me
And you don't even seem to notice

Light in my life, I want to keep this moment
While the night keeps us alive
Desolation lies beneath euphoria
It's a constant living on the edge
