I can't define no more what time is
An endless journey through the years
Even my tears are frozen

While I am sleeping I reach lands
And worlds of fantasy
I belong to the heart of the universe

A conqueror of unknown lands
And my heart is full of pride
Treasures and gold even a million miles away
And sun moon and stars without name

Here on the path of dreams alone but free
A burning flame inside my heart
I'm a wanderer in search for glory

The challenge I'm facing now will probably be my last
My will is carrying me on
I belong to the heart of the universe

A conqueror of unknown lands
And my heart is full of pride
Treasures and gold even a million miles away
And sun moon and stars without name

Dreaming, believing, travelling
Pride, tears, stars
