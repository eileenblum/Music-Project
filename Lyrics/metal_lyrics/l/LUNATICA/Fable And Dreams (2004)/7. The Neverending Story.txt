Wandering around here, I wish to be near you
Heaven help me, I'm on my own
I feel you, in my heart, you've never left me
Where can I find you, keeper of love

It felt like heaven, what tore us apart?
A perfect harmony, just like a dream
Come back my heart! I feel so cold in this darkness
Now I know that you were heaven-sent

I was your queen, you carried me
Through deepest desperation, you saved me
Come back to me and you will see
The grey will turn to daylight
You can set us free

You cast that spell over my senses
And I wonder how it could come so fast
Without you I'm no one, oh could you hold me
Once again, the flame would be renewed

I was your queen, you carried me
Through deepest desperation, you saved me
Come back to me and you will see
The grey will turn to daylight
You can set us free
