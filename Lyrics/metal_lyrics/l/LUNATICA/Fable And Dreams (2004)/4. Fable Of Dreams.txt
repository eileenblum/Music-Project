Sometimes in heaven a fable is born
Nobody knows where it comes from
It gives us strength and it tells us of love
And everyone of us is touched in their hearts
It may enrich us or pull us down so far
But life is not always black and white

Let me believe it, let my eyes see
Each day a new page is written, I know
Therefore this fable, it will never end
Because it's the fable of dreams

Hope for the hopeless and light for the blind
If we let this message reach our minds
It may enrich us or pull us down so far
And live can be more than black and white

Let me believe it, let my eyes see
Each day a new page is written, I know
Therefore this fable, it will never end
Because it's the fable of dreams

Hold on to belief, hear the call of the fable
The fable of dreams

Let me believe it, let my eyes see
Each day a new page is written, I know
Therefore this fable, it will never end
Because it's the fable of dreams
