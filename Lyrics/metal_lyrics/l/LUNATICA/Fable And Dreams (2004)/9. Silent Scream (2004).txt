Insomnia, I welcome thee

In the nights I see the world bleed
In my dreams I have to hide
I cannot close the door to this mystique place

My eyes blinded by the misery
Never I felt so much fear
It seems that I'm already in hell

Oh help me, my silent screams remain unheard

Insomnia is the key to my life
I don't want to see the world behind this thin curtain
Which separates conscience from sleep

In my back the knife is getting near
This could be my last breath
But somewhere I must find the door to morning

This time, if my senses are awake
I may pass the tin line into safety
But tomorrow it starts again

Oh help me, my silent screams remain unheard

Insomnia is the key to my life
I don't want to see the world behind this thin curtain
Which separates conscience from sleep
