A brand new thought is born in our minds,
Growing and taking clear shape
Will you reach for our hands and believe
That we are leading you up to new shores?

So come with us on a journey to irrationality,
Dreams and history, the adventure of your life!
Let yourself go, take a step into our world of melodies!
That's where hope means everything

Everyone can live their own dreams
It's just a matter of will
Take a step ahead, don't look back
May the wind be our eternal guide

So come with us on a journey to irrationality,
Dreams and history, the adventure of your life!
Let yourself go, take a step into our world of melodies!
That's where hope means everything

Follow your heart, lift your voice!
Music can open a door
It's the oldest way of expressing our feelings

Up to new shores!
We'll go ahead

So come with us on a journey to irrationality,
Dreams and history, the adventure of your life!
Let yourself go, take a step into our world of melodies!
That's where hope means everything
