In times of fear and loss, of staving and of pain,
Struggling to escape from here, but trying in vain
A group of the bravest men, born to change this plight
Awaited but not expected, they came to turn things right

They are the chosen ones, oh can't you see
Born to bring the light and end the misery

The seed of hope is sown, it's time for bravery
Freedom to the land shall come, and no more slavery

They are the chosen ones, oh can't you see
Born to bring the light and end the misery

Seasons are changing, so is mankind
Feelings unbound, setting free our minds

What does mankind want? What do they need?
We all want somebody to trust in.
Someone to follow who lead us in hard times,
who makes us believe in our strength, in ourselves.

They are the chosen ones, oh can't you see
Born to bring the light and end the misery
