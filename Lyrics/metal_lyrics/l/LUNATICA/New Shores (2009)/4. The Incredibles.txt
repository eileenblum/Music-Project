Once upon a time there was
A planet so tiny and blue
It was the perfect place to be
But one life form on it wanted more

But they don't see that it's half past twelve
To turn a blind eye is the easier way
As long as they feel safe in their beds
There's no need to wake up from their dream
But the truth no longer hides
They must see what they'll leave behind

Wake up, mankind, your time is running out
Give your children the chance to make things right

Now the planet is striking back
And, of course, the lamenting is big
Global warming, pollution as well
Is not enough to make them understand
That now is the time to change
Their behaviour and world's fate

Wake up, mankind, your time is running out
Give your children the chance to make things right
