My thoughts are bothering me
There's no sleep this night
Will be strong enough to rule the land?
After this I'll never be the same again
My whole life I was prepared for this one day
I was born with this dignity
I will lead them to victory
In my heart and my soul I know we have to win this fight
Face the day with serenity
It's a matter of destiny
Come what may I will do my best
To banish the eternal night
When the morning come I'll be the next queen
I must lead thousands to an unknown fate
I know they'll follow me wherever I may go
And it's pressing heavily upon my heart
I was born with this dignity
I will lead them to victory
In my heart and my soul I know we have to win this fight
Face the day with serenity
It's a matter of destiny
Come what may I will do my best
To banish the eternal night
Now the moment is here
I'm on the crucial walk
A thousand eyes are following
My steps towards the sword
Forged by the Gods
I was born with this dignity
I will lead them to victory
In my heart and my soul I know
That's the way that I have to go
Face the day with serenity
It's a matter of destiny
Come what may I will do my best
Because I know there's no time to take a rest
