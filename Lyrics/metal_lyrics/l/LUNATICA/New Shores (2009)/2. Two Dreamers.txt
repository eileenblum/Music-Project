You've always had the gift to make people smile
You rest inside yourself so naturally
Maybe sometimes you are far too sensitive, you know?
But that's why you mean so much to me

You helped me to believe that there's nothing that's impossible
You always knew that dreams are made for living them each day
You get what you deserve, that's an old law and the simple truth
If someone knows your deepest thoughts there's nothing more to say

Your eyes are curious and so is your mind
You want to understand the nature of all things
You're such an artist in everything you do
It is a blessing to be loved by you

You helped me to believe that there's nothing that's impossible
You always knew that dreams are made fir living them each day
You get what you deserve, that's an old law and the simple truth
If someone knows your deepest thoughts there's nothing more to say
