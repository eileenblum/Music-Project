Into the dissonance, I fall
Carried by an instant force
Craving for our harmony
But playing the odds

I see a light in the tunnel
But I step to the left
Put my hands to my hips
And do the dance

I cannot hear you, Ground Control
And it seems, they cut the rope
Weightless, I seem to fall
And it feels so good

[Chorus I:]
Into the dissonance, I fall
And I don't wanna lose control
But every moment I enjoy
Will keep the dissonance

Yes, life was good to me, I know
And I don't wanna let it go
I will come back soon
And try again

I'd be a raving fool to say
But I wish it all away
Yes, I knew the consequences
Like I knew the gains

So, do you think I'm out of tune?
All these tones don't fit the song
Just a little melody
In a much bigger symphony

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]
Into the dissonance, I fall
And I don't wanna let it go
But every moment I enjoy
Will keep it dissonant

Set me free
Please, could you exorcise me
And I start again, please
Help me [x3]

[Chorus I &amp; II]
