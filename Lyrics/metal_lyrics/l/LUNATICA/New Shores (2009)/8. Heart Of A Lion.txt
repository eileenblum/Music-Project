Broken heart broken dreams
No idea of what love means
A girl on the run with much hope left inside
Shes alone that night but the starlight guides
Her small steps on this road leading back to you

Shes a fighter burns brighter
The heart of a lion
And shes trying to get over you, my friend
Shes a dreamer, believer
Her faith doesn't leave her
You're no longer part of her life, oh no

No more fear no more lies
No more tears in her eyes
A new day has come with new chances in sight
Back on her feet again she's made a brand new start
To explore the whole world and the secrets within

She's a fighter burns brighter
The heart of a lion
And shes trying to get over you, my friend
She's a dreamer, believer
Her faith doesn't leave her
You're no longer part of her life, oh no

Don't you keep waiting!
You can't hold her tight
She's a leaf in the wind, she's broken her chains

Shes a fighter burns brighter
The heart of a lion
And shes trying to get over you, my friend
She's a dreamer, believer
Her faith doesn't leave her
You're no longer part of her life, oh no
