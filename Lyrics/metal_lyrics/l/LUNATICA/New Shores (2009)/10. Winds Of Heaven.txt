There is no place for me
Here in this lunacy
Its getting harder to breathe
And hold my screams

I might've made it through
If I'd just talked with you

Now it's too late to pursue
Or hold this dream

Oh, but I'd love to fly
Up to the starry sky
Step through the open door
Let the winds of heaven roar

I might've been someone
But I was on the run
Now that it's said and done
I'm free to stop

Oh, but I'd love to fly
To to the starry sky
Step through the open door
Let the winds of heaven roar
