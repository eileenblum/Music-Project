I've been feeling so uncertain
Since the day you left my life
Now I'm standing at the crossroads
No direction left to go

I've been thinking 'bout the good times
And I've cried a lake of tears
If losing you is just a nightmare
I hope I wake up by your side

Farewell my love
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light

So many words been left unspoken
And some words were far too much
Maybe sometimes love is hurting
But it's the sweetest pain I know

Farewell my love
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light

Farewell my love
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light

Ooh, farewell my love (my love/goodbye)
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light (to the light)
