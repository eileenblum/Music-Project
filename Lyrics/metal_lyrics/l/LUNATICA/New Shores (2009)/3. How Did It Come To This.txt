You left me broken
Torn up inside
And the sky has darkened
Like I'm buried alive

This scar won't stop to bleed
But I can't make a sound
Try to say what I feel
But nothing comes out

How did it come to this?
I'm trapped behind these walls
I got no air to breathe
It's like I'm under water
Can you hear me?
My silent scream
Can you hear me?
My silent scream

Try to reach the surface
But something pulls me down

And there's a voice within
Dying to come out
In the corners of my head
The silence is so loud

How did it come to this?
I'm trapped behind these walls
I got no air to breathe
It's like I'm under water
Can you hear me?
My silent scream
Can you hear me?
My silent scream

Calling for you
But I can't break through
Will I be rescued
Before it's too late?

How did it come to this?
I'm trapped behind these walls
I got no air to breathe
It's like I'm under water
Can you hear me?
My silent scream
Can you hear me?
My silent scream
