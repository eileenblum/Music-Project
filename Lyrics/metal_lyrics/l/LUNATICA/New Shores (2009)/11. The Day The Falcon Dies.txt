100 years we are bound on this spell
Lovers separated in a cruel way
What did we do to deserve such a fate?
Somebody free us before it's too late

I'm the falcon and you are the wolf
Never human shape at the same time
Each dawn some minutes is all that remains
I fear the daylight

With the first sunshine I spend my wings
Watching over you and every step you take
At night I can't sleep, know you are near
I listen to your howling, my eyes filled with tears

I'm the falcon and you are the wolf
Never human shape at the same time
Each dawn some minutes is all that remains
I fear the daylight

The days the falcon dies I will be free
