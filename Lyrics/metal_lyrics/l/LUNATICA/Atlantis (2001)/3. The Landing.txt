Donât turn away from her, liar, you promised to beware her from argue
Itâs the only way to save your mortal soul
Her vivid expressions, the detailed report of things that will be
Are throwing a spell over you

[Refr:]
Hear her prophecies
Open your heart and mind to her hypnotic voice
Believe and youâll see the truth
But donât let hatred reign your life

Sheâs gifted with the eye and dreams of genocide
Once you cried with her, after sleeping in her bed
Now you're blinded by the fire of ignorance
That people lit in your miserable heart
