Insomnia I welcome thee
In the nights I see the world bleed, in my dreams I have to hide
I cannot close the door to this mystique place
My eyes blinded by the misery, never I felt so much fear
It seems Iâm already in hell
Oh help me, my silent screams remain unheard

[Refr:]
Insomnia is the key to my life
I donât want to see the world behind
This thin curtain which separates
Conscience from sleep

In my back the knife is getting near, this could be my last breath
But somewhere I must find the door to morning
This time, if my senses are awake, I may pass the thin line into safety
But tomorrow it starts again
Insomnia I welcome thee
