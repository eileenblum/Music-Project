Autumn has come, Iâm loosing my leaves
The sand has almost ran through
Run, run, run for eternal youth
I must escape from my faith
There is no bribery to make the mirror lie

Run, run, run, run
The air is getting thin

In my lifeâs opera, they play the final notes
The happy tunes turned to minor
Time is hunting me, there is no way out
My winter will come
A long time ago the orchard in me has whithered
Time to go
