In the shades he finds protection, heâs a fallen angel on the run
The night welcomes him like a lost son
As heâs walking under his brother moonlight
Nobody knows where heâs coming from
His breath is freezing the branches of the trees
And his eyes are almost perforating the environment around him

[Refr:]
He sets the world under ice
His aura is white gleaming
Around him eternal coldness

But inside he hides a warm shine as heâs waiting to change into spring
Sorrow and grief are his two companions, heâs older than mankind
They fear him and the gifts he brings them
But they know they need him to reanimate creation
In the circle of nature he was always the most displeasing one

A scapegoat for the tragedies of life
And this is the way it will always be
