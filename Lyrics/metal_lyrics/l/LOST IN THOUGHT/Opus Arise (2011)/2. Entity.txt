(Who's there?)

I lie awake at night,
I feel its touch come over me.
(The clock strikes my calling hour,
I choose your soul to devour!)
Why can't you find no peace?
My soul is mine which you cannot keep.
(I must consume life to remain,
I'll cut like a knife to enter your domain!)

Possessed by an immortal entity,
There's no peace for me!

An unknown being
Wants to reside within my soul.
(To take hold of your sanctuary,
To distance you from reality!)
Banish this vile creature
To a realm where it must stay!
(You can't defy my presence,
My withered touch is your life's essence!)

Possessed by an immortal entity,
There's no peace for me!

"Dear Lord, I pray to you
In this time of need.
A creature is conspiring its demonic opus,
Wanting to claim my soul,
Wanting to arise..."

Why must it be this way?
Why isn't there an answer
To my prayers today?
This entity overwhelms my being,
It seeks to consume me,
To make our auras trapped as one
For all eternity!
