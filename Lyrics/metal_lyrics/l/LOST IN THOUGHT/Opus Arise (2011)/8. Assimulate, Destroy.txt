He heard the voices calling, his brothers lay around.
Reaching for the skies, wanting to be free.
That was the time the righteous made their stand.
The whole world was shaking, judgement was at hand.

Awaken, crusaders!
(Crusaders!)
Ensnare the flames within your eyes!
(Eyes!)
Assimulate, destroy!
(To destroy!)
Behold the fury, we will rise!
(We will rise!)

Crusaders fought for justice in the Father's name,
With his eternal glory the tyrant's sins were cleansed.
They held their spirits high,
By his command they did surely die!

Awaken, crusaders!
(Crusaders!)
Ensnare the flames within your eyes!
(Your eyes!)
Assimulate, destroy!
(To destroy!)
Behold the fury, we will rise!
(We will rise!)

"This day determines our fate.
If need be, we'll give the ultimate sacrifice,
For under God's watch we shall be protected
And nothing can harm us.
If this is our God's kingdom,
Then let the Gods decide who wins here this day,
Though our kingdom shall be for all eternity!
Crusaders! What do I see before me?
I see an army ready to make a stand for what we believe!
Our banners shall own the sky.
Brothers, we stand here today under God's eyes,
For in the first place they are here
Just like us: to achieve their salvation!"

(Assimulate...)
(Assimulate...)
Assimulate! Destroy!
