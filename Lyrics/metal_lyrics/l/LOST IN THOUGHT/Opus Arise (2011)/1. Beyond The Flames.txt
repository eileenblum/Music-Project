Dreaming, or so it seems,
Where unwelcome visions
Won't cease to be.
When all is lost and nothing's free,
We dance through the flames for eternity.

In the mist it burns my eyes,
Demons hide behind a disguise.
I must break free,
Beyond the flames!

I'm drifting, I'm slipping
Through the world that has no end.
I'm learning about the journey set before me.

Obscuring shadows in the night
Teach me of my destiny.
Help me to save my soul,
See what the future holds.

No seasons change in this forgotten place,
My mind is so overthrown.
There must be hope and some peace for me,
Oh God, can't you hear me?!

In this realm where demons roam,
Lost souls, they call this home.
I must break free,
Beyond the flames!

Obscuring shadows in the night
Teach me of my destiny.
Help me to save my soul,
See what the future holds.
Obscuring shadows in the night
Teach me of my destiny.
Help me to save my soul,
See what the future holds.

I'm all alone, I've walked the same road.
I tried to make sense
Of all these thoughts!
Endless pain! It tears me up inside.
It makes me feel there's nowhere,
Nowhere left to hide!

Obscuring shadows in the night
Teach me of my destiny.
Help me to save my soul,
See what the future holds.
Obscuring shadows in the night
Teach me of my destiny.
Help me to save my soul,
See what the future holds.

Figures appear in the night,
They've taught me of my destiny
And helped me to save my soul
Beyond the flames and misery!
