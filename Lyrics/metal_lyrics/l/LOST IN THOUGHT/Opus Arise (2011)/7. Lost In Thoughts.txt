Reflecting on my darkest times,
My greatest test of all.
My friend and I were following
A stranger new to town.
So eager to unveil his truths,
We set upon his home.
As the cloak of night began to fall,
We started to hear...

Blood-curdling screams
Echoed through the night,
Compelled to investigate.
As we drew near, stopped in our paths
By noises within stones' throw.

All that we saw were lucid shadows.
From here my ordeal begins
As darkness began to manifest.
Ivory skin, living undead,
Skin so bitter it bears the coldest touch.
At the blink of an eye,
We were surrounded by
Beasts of the night,
An evil horde that came to abolish.
Next thing that I knew,
My friend was taken down.
He laid there pale and still,
Pierced by a scathing kiss.

Searching through the night to find the sun.
I'm forever lost in thoughts,
My state of mind, it haunts me.
Trapped in darkness
Where these beasts all gather,
I must resume my ways
And avoid the cursed shadows.

Searching through the night to find the sun.
I'm forever lost in thoughts,
My state of mind, it haunts me.
Trapped in darkness
Where these beasts all gather,
I must resume my ways
And avoid the cursed shadows.

I'm standing here all on my own,
My fears have all come to me.
From a friend, now to foe,
I must stand and fight
To rid us all of this evil.
None must survive
In the kingdom of the night!

Behold tainted nights, so dark and bitter.
I try to escape my thoughts,
I'm lost in eternal shadows!
Yet my time may come to walk beside them,
To exist forever until the light consumes me...
