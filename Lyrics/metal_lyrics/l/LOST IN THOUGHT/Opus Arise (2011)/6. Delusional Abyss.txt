In my dreams these words unfold,
An endless journey to behold.
I'll learn what life I'll lead
Through mystery.
Now I see past destiny,
My life's set out before me.
It's calling me!

All thoughts suppressing,
Awake me from this dream.
Set me free, take me far away.
Take my hand! I'm so afraid!

My journey through the empty space.
I find myself alone!
I wake to find no peace of mind.
It's in my head, it seeks my soul.

Contained in this place, a lonely soul,
My only hope is to get home.
Stranded in this plain divides us two,
I'll get back to you.

I need you here beside me
To change my destiny.
I must be free, take me far away.
Take my hand! I'm so afraid!

My journey through the empty space.
I find myself alone!
I wake to find no peace of mind.
It's in my head, it seeks my soul.

My journey past the empty space.
You take me by the hand.
I wake to find you next to me,
You're in my head to guide me home.

My journey from the empty space.
Now I'm not alone!
I wake to find you next to me
(You next to me...)
You saved my soul and brought me home!
