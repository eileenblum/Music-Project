She told herself she would prevail,
Across the sands, beyond the seas.
She was looking for the answers
To make herself complete.
She's searching for the stone,
A jewel lost in time.

With an angel beside her
To help her through the void,
She sees it waiting there
As the legend's told.
By her side, she'd give her life
For the blood red diamond.

The ancients cast the sands of time,
Her pain was lost in an endless shine.
She lays herself to rest,
In an enchanting glow she'll remain obsessed.
She was longing for the stone,
A jewel lost in time!

With an angel beside her
To help her through the void,
She sees it waiting there
As the legend's told.
By her side, she'd give her life
For the blood red diamond.

There are no exceptions,
They all wither, those who lust
For the blood red diamond!

With an angel beside her
To help her through the void,
She sees it waiting there
As the legend's told.
By her side, she'd give her life
For the blood red diamond.

Blood red diamond, she'd give her life!
Blood red diamond, she'd give her life!
