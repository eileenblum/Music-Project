Without you here,
Loneliness is now my friend.
My memories pacing,
I'm scared that this may be the end.
The truth I'm facing, I close my eyes
And try to pretend...

I chase the moment
Around a maze that never seems to end,
Taking steps to walk along
The empty path of descent.
I'm slowly fading,
Will this feeling cease to be?
I need to change right here, right now.
I won't look back,
I must move on without you!

New times awaken, I won't be broken.
New times awaken, I won't be broken.
