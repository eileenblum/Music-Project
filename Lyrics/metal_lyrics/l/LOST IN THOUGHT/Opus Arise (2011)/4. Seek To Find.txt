All alone I had a dream,
There's questions inside.
In my vision it was you
Standing by my side.
For I have been forsaken
By decision in my past.
I must relinquish my choices
To be with you at last.

I'm searching for you,
I seek to find your heart.
To see you right beside me,
I'd play my part.
I'm standing waiting,
I seek to find our destinies
To make our futures set in stone,
To soar and be free.

I seek to find our destinies,
I seek to find a place called home.
I seek to find you next to me,
United hearts forever more!

I just need to see your face,
Call out to me now.
I know we would find a way somehow...
Take me to the place
Where we'd be eternal!

I'm searching for you,
I seek to find your heart.
To see you right beside me,
I'd play my part.
I'm standing waiting,
I seek to find our destinies
To make our futures set in stone,
To soar and be free.

I seek to find our destinies,
I seek to find a place called home.
I seek to find you next to me,
United hearts forever more!

I wish I could see you
And hold the world in my hands.
I'm left out in the cold!

I seek to find our destinies,
I seek to find a place called home.
I seek to find you next to me,
United hearts forever more!
