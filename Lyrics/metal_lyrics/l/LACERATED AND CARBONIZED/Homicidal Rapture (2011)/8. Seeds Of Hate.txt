A storm unfolds
The end is near
Veil of lies
Mourn in fear

Jesus Christ
Under the cross
Burn in flames
Buried God

Rumours of a dethroned savior
Seeds of hate sown forever
Dominance - hatred
Death and pain shall be entwined
Seeds of hate forever

Swarm of worms
Impiety
Almighty One
That ceases to be

His blood is shed
Torment unleashed
Void of damnation
Pure blasphemy
