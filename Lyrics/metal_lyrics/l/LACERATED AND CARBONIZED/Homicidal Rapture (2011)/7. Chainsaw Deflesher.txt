Draining your blood, object of disgust
I foresee your demise in my eyes
No one for life, undying hate
Annihilation, the only way

Decomposing
Strangulated
Mutilation and desperation

Chainsaw

Piercing your brain in rapture
I can feel the shivers in your arms
Perpetuation, atrocious fate
Assassination, vulgar decay

Disfiguration
Decapitated
Retaliation and separation

Chainsaw
