The weak shall lean towards the raging wrath
Devoid of mercy in my trail of bloodlust
Kill through sodomic waves, I bring rebellion
Despised is your empty god, succumb to my hunger

Awake our darkest selves from dormancy
Subconscious sickness, encaptured into mindlessness
Kill, forge the spawn of death, specters of vehemence
On course of devastation, I worship destruction

Defiled supremacy
The coldest thrill of death

Mayhem descendant
Baptized in hate
Elucidating infection in a world of lies
Ireful manifesto in vile words

Taste the ecstasy
Of massacre
Decrepit creed

Obliteration
Of mass deceit
Lay waste to effete vultures, slay all myths and entities
My sovereign contention, drowned in binding vengeance

When domination lies between the lines
Inciting new science, nefarious rhetoric
A reign of stigmatic imposture, scavengers of alienation
I spread the strain of hatred, my sectarian covenant

Dethroned supremacy
The coldest thrill of death

Mayhem descendant
Baptized in hate
Elucidating infection in a world of lies
Ireful manifesto in vile words

Taste the ecstasy
Of massacre
Decrepit creed

Embrace the agony
Behold the rise
Iniquity

Despised plague
Regnant crusade
Beyond the legends
Shall stand the flesh

Despised God
Abandoned Lord
Beyond the legends
Shall stand the flesh
