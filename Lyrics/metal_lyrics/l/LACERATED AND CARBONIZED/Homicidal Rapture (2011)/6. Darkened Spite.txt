Chaos flood
Thoughts in disarray
Striped of all my senses
Violence reinstate

Spectral infestion
Stride the broken line
Seeking destruction
Solace cast aside

Seared emotions
Madness in hindsight

Innermost subversion
Mounting to the core
Shrouded in revulsion
No one shall ignore

No pain abates this heinous pride
The aftermath of unhealing wounds
A dreadful strain of conscious rage
Forged in a starved desire

Glare the opaque and lifeless eyes
A late nt spell of the inner ruin
Where blended tides of woe and wrath
Ascend and burn with an unnatural strife

Darkened spite
Inflicting death and misery
A bitter taste of insanity
Consumed by damnation

Chaos force
Thoughts in disarray
Striped of all my senses
Violence reinstate

Spectral infection
Stride the broken line
Breathing morbid horror
Solace cast aside

Terror reigns
Concealed in me
