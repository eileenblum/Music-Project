Seize this lifeless matter
Slave of decadence
Ominous disciple
Of unhallowed arts

Perfect replication
Of the human frame
The principle of life
In every minute part

We lay the foundation
We are annihilation

Hominal endeavour
To mock the engines of the scorn
Profane, disclaiming injunctions
Blessed as the creator and source

Abiogenesis
Disclaim the birth of humanity
Divine aversion, victory of men
Bear the stain to which I give vent

Abiogenesis
Deny the order of God
Abiogenesis
No longer defer to his grace

Seize this lifeless matter
Unconcealed decay
Dissident conception
Of your hallowed light

Hideous creation
Of the human frame
Claim the spark of life
Dominance at hand

We lay the foundation
We are annihilation

No more indulgence
Shattered is your foundry of illusions

Abiogenesis
Deny the order of God
Abiogenesis
No longer defer to his grace
