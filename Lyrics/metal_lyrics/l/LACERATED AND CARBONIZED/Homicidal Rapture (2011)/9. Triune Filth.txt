Fractal God disintegration
Heading towards detachment
The euphony of canons
Nurtures the blackest breed

The mark has been made
Astound devotion halt
The womb spits contradiction
To faithless eyes

Watching as the quandary withers
Mute their pitiful chants of praise

Eternal, perpetual
A stare into the abyss
Perennial, immortal
The grandeur erodes

Ascension, atonement
Expose the greatest weakness
Insidious distortion
Incorporeal waste

Through poisoned words
The stillborn speaks
Harvest of blood
Triune filth

Synthesized vindication
Apostasy in motion
Fed on the fractured order
Strings of the absolute

Illusion set to perish
Blight of the hallowed sight
My ways will not be merited
To appeal nor stain

Watching as the quandary withers
Echoing through vaults of pain

Eternal, perpetual
A stare into the abyss
Perennial, immortal
The grandeur erodes

Ascension, atonement
Expose the greatest weakness
Insidious distortion
Incorporeal waste

Through poisoned words
The stillborn speaks
Harvest of blood
Triune filth

Eternal, perpetual
Expose the greatest sickness
Perennial, immortal
The abyss staring back
