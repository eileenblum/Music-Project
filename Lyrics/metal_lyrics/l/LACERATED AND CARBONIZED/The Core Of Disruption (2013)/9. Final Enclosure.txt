Bring'em
Bring'em
Bring'em to their knees
Brutal reprisal
New authority

Grudge fills the carcass of what once was a man
Self-made fortress, my compassion has been slain

I walk on broken glass
Fear along my path
Now that you are stranded
There's no stepping back

The final enclosure
Burns from inside
Boundaries of madness
Left far behind

Put your reason down to savor all this misery
Sanity defiled, over this pain I reign supreme

World of disillusion
Comes crumbling down
Retribution
Eye for an eye

I rave when you cry my name
Rupture I will regain
Infusion
Conclusion
My resentful offerings

I rave when you cry my name - When you cry it
Rupture I seek to regain - Never cry it
Infusion
Conclusion
My resentful Offerings

Put your reason down to savor all this misery
Sanity defiled, over this pain I reign supreme

World of disillusion
Comes crumbling down
Retribution
Eye for an eye

I rave when you cry my name - When you cry it
Rupture I seek to regain - Never cry it
Infusion
Conclusion
My resentful Offerings
