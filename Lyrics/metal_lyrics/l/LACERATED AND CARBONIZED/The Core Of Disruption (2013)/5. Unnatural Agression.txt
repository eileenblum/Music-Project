Twisting, denying
Apology is policy
The domains of truth
Unbeknownst to me

The halls of power
Will keep denying knowledgment
Clouded in secrecy
Don't recall my name

Engaged in regression
A crippling control

A torpid nation
Where freedom is commodified
A blind dictation
Erase the traces left behind

Your state of terror
Is carrying out a foul indoctrination
Opposition
Against the order of the leech

Drowned in blame
A world insane

Domination
Tragedy is innate
Corrosion
Morals ripped and torn

The law of the end

For the sake of truth
I forfeit my life
Unnatural agression

They cut out my eyes
But I will always see
Unnatural agression

The strings of power will draw me a thousand faces
In isolation I fight against the undertow

Deceiver
Through the hollowed ways
Discretion
Rests insane

Poisonous trait

Impeding death
Still they choke on lies
Unnatural agression

Salvation in silence
I will deny forever

They cut out my eyes
But I will always see
Unnatural agression

When they cut out my eyes
I will still see the end of times
Unnatural agression
