On cracked soil he walks
To vengeance he is drawn
A product of disdain
Defiance will remain

A labour of despise
Before the public eye
Gearing up for
His crude reckoning

Human rights
Swept away
Realize
Execution awaits

Destruction, the unknown,
Revenge will run its course
A maxim that holds true
The nemesis untamed

Abiding stigma
His massive wounds will never heal
Embodiment of failure
The foulest enemy

Death, rise
The final warning is now
Death, rise
The call for blood resounds

A consummated threat
Psychosis growing
In sickness intertwined
The scorn never dies

Human rights
Swept away
Realize
Execution awaits

Destruction, the unknown,
Revenge will run its course
A maxim that holds true
The nemesis untamed

Death
The call for blood resounds

A consummated threat
Psychosis growing
In sickness intertwined
The scorn never dies

The call for blood resounds
The call for blood resounds
