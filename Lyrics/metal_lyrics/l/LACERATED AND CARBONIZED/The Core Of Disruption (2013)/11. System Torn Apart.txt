Heed your way, oh burning fire
Time has come to invoke dissent
Ages soaked in lies
Order drenched in pain
When the flames rise higher
Clench your fists

A system torn apart
As intolerance spreads
Treasonous infestation
Unleashed the hate refrained
A chasm that breeds corruption
Disappears as we rise

Traverse this framework of two thousand years
Tear down the walls and underscore this fervid rage

Burning flesh
Boils in me
Turmoil is my name

And I witness the desert clouds fading
No common ground, the execution now is set
Ressurection

The decoys will fall
For their reign is dead
A call for revolution
Tread on deceitful wyles

Overturn this shapeless severance
Wake from this slumberous sway and hold the domination

Time is now to invoke dissent

Corrupt foundations of autocracy
Smash them all, our paragon unfolding still

Retribution built on blood

Cowards smothered
Trenches decimated
Our rebellious instinct will prevail

The river runs red
Ride the tides of fate
When violence is bliss
Let the purge begin

The trail of deconstruction carries on

The creations from the dead
Will surrender to this grace

Burn and slay
A vile intervention
Raze and destroy
Shades of despair

Heed your way, a burning fire
Time has come to invoke dissent
Ages soaked in lies
Order drenched in pain
When the flames rise higher
Clench your fists

Ages soaked in lies
Clench your fists
