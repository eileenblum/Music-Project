Loitering in the shadows
Drowned into a sea of filth
Waging an endless war
Reveal its twisted face

Burning with the fire
Justice bend its knees
The law of suffering
Pandemic domination

A web of vice and greed, the perfect the host for parasites
Feeds from the force of every word spat by deceiving snakes
We were born to die, we are nothing but the spawn of hate
From dust to ashes, to pieces of a human waste

Underworld of power
Parallel regime
Collapsed institutions
The inner-sanctum of lieS

No fight, no glory
Militia attack

CorrupÃ§Ã£o, corporaÃ§Ã£o
O Ã³dio e o caos vindos da favela
Sell their souls, lords of the plagues
The root of all tribulation

Honor cast aside
Reflections that bleed
An effigy stripped of pride

Truce, illusion out of sight
Lost in the depths of an endless strife
Pain, struggle, I count the days
Lost in the depths of an endless strife

No fight, no glory
Militia attack

Honor cast aside

Truce, illusion out of sight
Lost in the depths of an endless strife
Pain, struggle, I count the days
Lost in the depths of an endless strife

CorrupÃ§Ã£o, insurreiÃ§Ã£o
O Ã³dio e o caos vindos da favela
CorrupÃ§Ã£o, corporaÃ§Ã£o
O Ã³dio e o caos vindos da favela
