Brutal Red Command
Druglords arm their fiefdoms
Beyond a wall of fear
A state on the brink of collapse

Self determination fed by hatred
Segregation
Hopeless nation
Broken promisses
Architecture of disease

Welcome to where corruption overrules
Welcome to where depravity is unbound

We crawl amidst the wreckage
We breathe brutality
Revulsion sets the message

Separation led to hatred
Segregation
Hopeless nation
Broken promisses
Set the core of disruption

Welcome to where corruption is the rule
Welcome to where distress is sovereign

Blood drenched power

Taste the anger in the streets
Feel the sorrow in the eyes
Third world slavery

Emptiness that sells disgrace
Deceive, erase
Emptiness that sells disgrace
Deceive and betray

Delusion leads the speech
Our people cry
All trace of hope is dead and gone
Welcome to Rio
Third world slavery

Blood
Pain
Death
Third world slavery
