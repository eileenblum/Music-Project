When no shepherd
Yearns to guard the herd
And the cold night falls

Broken boundaries of shame
Never-ending pain
Let the blood come down

I will burn all your tears
And grant you the end
To recall the scenes in every sore

Compassion I berate
I repudiate
In you I see no humanity

Bodies sprawled on the stairs
Does their god care?
I write on crooked lines
And cast the last stone

When we think of the lies
Spin the wheel of chance
Carnage with no regrets
Laid to waste

Remove the dust to justify
Your heinous ways

My shattered dreams raise memories all gone astray
Recoiled in fear my fate is sealed
Brutal annihilation

No longer blind
Uncovering the spite
The stigma they bear
Is right in the eye

When we think of the lies
Spin the wheel of chance
Carnage with no regrets
Laid to waste

CandelÃ¡ria, the streets are on fire
CandelÃ¡ria, a ruthless empire
The last degree
CandelÃ¡ria
