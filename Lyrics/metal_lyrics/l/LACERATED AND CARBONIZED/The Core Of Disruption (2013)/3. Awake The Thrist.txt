Torn in rage
Dismal eyes of the insane
Shattering embrace
I crack under the strain

Paralyzed as hatred soars
Ripping my desperate breath
Immersed in dismay and destroyed
I swallow my fury and bleed

Reprobate

He came to spread distress
Disprove the past to regain the rest
Reckless cruelty
The blackest of the rules

Delusion, suffering
Tainted subjugation
Viciousness awakes the thirst

Torn in rage
Purity is disparaged
A lesson in vindication
Rejoice in my decay

For the harm my actions brought
My life will be drawn to a close
Descended into grief and distraught
Aprehension constricts the throat

No repentance

Delusion, suffering
Tainted subjugation
Viciousness awakes the thirst

Execution is there for all to see

Conditional death row
Before you lose control

It's time to kill again
It's time to kill and maim
It's time, out of control

It's time
