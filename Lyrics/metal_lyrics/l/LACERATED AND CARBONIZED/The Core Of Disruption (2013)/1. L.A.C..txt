Overwhelming terror
Trapped and hopeless to survive
Deranged violation
Anguish fills your fearful eyes

On this depraved ground
Treachery has sealed your fate
Despotic prosecution
Cruelty is unrestrained

Martyr of a lost cause
Torture drawing near
The bitter price you have to pay
Is coming at once

You're lacerated and carbonized

No escape
From agony
Relentless surge
There is no relief

Dawn of false illusions
Pleasure in gore, it never ends
The laws of death and life
Injected by hate and chaos
Into a rotten ditch
Fragments of your charred remains

Martyr of a lost cause
Torture drawning near
The bitter price you have to pay
Is coming at once

You are bound to rot
X-9 in fire
