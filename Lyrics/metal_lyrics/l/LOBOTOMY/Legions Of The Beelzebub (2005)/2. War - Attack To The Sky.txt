My name it is Satan
My enemy is Ialdabaoth
We will confront our selves
We will dispute the throne

I will direct
An attack
To the sky
And I will conquer

I will hurtle to the abyss to Ialdabaoth

And I will
Make grow
Mi I number
Of you kill

The flavor of the blood will ascend toward mi

There am here,
That I will look
The earth
To collapse

To collapse in their own suffering

I will condemn
To Ialdabaoth
To live
In the darkness

And truth my hate from the humanity's hate

Attack to the sky
Armies of the hate
Attack to the sky
All!!

My name it is vengeance
My enemy is Ialdabaoth
We will confront our selves
And I will take the throne

But conquered god would become Satan

Attack to the sky
Armies of the hate
Attack to the sky
All!!

And I when conquering would become god

Attack to the sky
Armies of the hate
Attack to the sky
All!!

That the fates liberate me of future fellow man!!
