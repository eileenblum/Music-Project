I don't care a shit I only want to be dead
I don't care that makes neither as makes it
neither like will finish only to enjoy your death
For that the law indicate eye for eye

Dies
Gay

In the past you made me much bad
You abused of my and of my people
I gave you every thing and all my heart
And I was rewarded with the betrayal

But the show it should begin
Because the snake speaks for my hearing
And tells me
Kill them, kill them, kill them!!!

Dies
Gay

A dark night me truth to appear
And under the shine of my weapon kneeling you begged pity
Then I will kill to all your family
But to the boy I will leave I live

Culebra
Work malicious.
