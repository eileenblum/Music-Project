I am one it schemes of killing
The roared of my vengeance
They destroy the still of the air

I will give sign of warning
To those that don't fear me

I will call to my legions
So that they tear with great delight
To this it kills that I have chosen

Enormous black and slippery forms
They rose of the thorny wells
Ans they vomited their pestilence
Toward their mean brain

Moves and appear
Present you before the one

Oh, they come in name of Abbadon
And it destroys to that whose sign will give you

I am not sorry to invoke
Because I will leave dangerous snakes

Oh, big siblings of the night
You that comfort my home
That you ride on the winds of the hell,

Oh, Abbadon! lacerate their lungs
With stings of the scorpions
Lacerate that language
And cut him the throat

Oh, they come in name of Abbadon
And it destroys to that whose sign will give you

The invocation..
