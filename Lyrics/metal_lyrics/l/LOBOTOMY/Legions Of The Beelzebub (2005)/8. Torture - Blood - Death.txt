In the name
Sathanas

I don't believe in the hypocrisy
Neither in the moral dogmas
Of the call civilized society
I have enough with looking
Inside of this room
To know you like they are
Liars, cowards,
Murderers and thieves

We are the races of the night
We are the legions of the darkness

All with their legal profession
They are some hypocritical worms
They put me sick
Don't need to hear their shit
I cannot understand
The reasons of their fucking society
I have already heard them
The arguments always the same ones

We are the races of the night
We are the legions of the darkness

Torture - blood - death - destruction

They don't understand me
Such and as it supposed it
They are not able to make it
I am beyond their experience
Beyond the right and the wrong
But I will never lose the faith
I will be avenged
because Lucifer this with us

We are the races of the night
We are the legions of the darkness

Torture - blood - death - destruction

Kill them!!!.
