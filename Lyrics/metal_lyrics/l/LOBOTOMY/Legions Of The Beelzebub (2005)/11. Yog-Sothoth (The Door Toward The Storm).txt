Open up
The door
Toward
The storm

I am Yog-Sothoth and I will call to the old ones
When the stars mark the time of their coming
Because I am through the door of the one which
Those of the hole enter again

Entities
Wicked
Darkness
And disorder

Six, six, six

Entities
Wicked
Blasphemies
And chaos

Six, six, six

I know the labyrinths of the time
Because the time is one for mi
I know for where the old ones appeared
From the very remote times

Six, six, six

Entities
Wicked
Darkness
And Disorder

Six, six, six

You for where they appear again
When the cycle begins again
Then of the day comes the night
The man's days passed
And them reign where they reigned once
For their you will now baseness them
And their it will curse stain the earth
Entities, wicked, darkness and disorder

Open up
The door
Toward
The storm.
