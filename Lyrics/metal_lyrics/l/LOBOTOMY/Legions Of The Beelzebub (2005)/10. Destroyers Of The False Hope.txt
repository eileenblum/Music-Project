Worshipers
Damned
Fanatic

Blessed the strong ones
They will possess the earth
Damned the weak ones
Of them it will be the yoke
The powerful ones
They will be worshipped among the men
damned the idiots
Die all!!!

Worshipers
Damned
Fanatic

Let us destroy the false hope

Blessed the intrepid ones
They will be masters of the world,
damned the humble ones,
Perish squashed by the infernal hoof
Blessed the man of iron
Because the inapt ones escape in their presence
Damned the poor of spirit
Toward them one will spit.

Worshipers
Damned
Fanatic

Always blessed
The destroyers of the false hope
because them
Will be the true messiah.
damned,
The worshipers of god
because them
Will be rejected sheep

Damned worshipers!!!.
