Mi demoniac side will destroy everything to its step

The scent to hate
The love for the vengeance
They filter for the pores
Of the human meat

Murderous side
Demoniac side

The feeling of anger
And revenge are even
More stronger than the peace
In the whole universe

Murderous side
Demoniac side

Believe it

There is not chance

This converts the beings
In big unhinged beasts
Vile beings, infamous beings
And without power of reasoning

Murderous side
Demoniac side

The plague of the misery counter attacks
From the very small towns
Until the very giant empires
Until the abysmal universes

Murderous side
Demoniac side

Believe it

There is not chance

We all are shit.
