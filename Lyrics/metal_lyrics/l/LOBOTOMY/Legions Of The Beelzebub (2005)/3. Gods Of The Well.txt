In our king's
Satan name
The giant among
The lucifuegos
In the name
Of Satanas
The one that
Governs in the earth

Gods of the well
Take me to their home
Gods of the well
Make me it leaves of their life

I send to the forces
Of the darkness
That grant me
The infernal forces
That the doors of the hell
Will be had
And that the snakes
Of their abyss emerge

To all the kings
Of all the kings
Accept I eat up
To their brother and friend
I swear that I will defend
With soul and spirit
The great reign
Of our damned culture

Gods of the well
Take me to their home
gods of the well
Make me it leaves of their life

Emerge
Emerge of their abyss
Emerge of their hell.
