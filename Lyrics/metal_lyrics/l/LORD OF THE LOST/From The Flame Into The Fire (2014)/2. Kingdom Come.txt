We cannot wait till kingdom come!
We cannot wait till kingdom come!

Naked I came from motherâs womb
And dressed to kill I will depart
I will not give but I will take
And may my peopleâs names be praised!

We cannot wait till kingdom come!

Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?
Where the disputer of this world?
Who finds delight in killing scum?
We cannot wait till kingdom come!

Below me a kiss before I leave
Before were running out of time
Give me a reason to believe
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
We cannot wait till kingdom come!
Until were running out of time
Give me a reason to be strong
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!

We cannot wait till kingdom come!

You say the foolishness of god
Is so much wiser than all men
So may my gods will always be punned
And fucking swallowed be thy name

Below me a kiss before i leave
Before were running out of time
Give me a reason to believe
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
We cannot wait till kingdom come!
Until were running out of time
Give me a reason to be strong
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
BEFORE I DIE!
BEFORE I...

Let loose and jump the gun
Until our worlds collide
Letâs fuck the priests and nuns
And nail them to the cross of light

Below me a kiss before i leave
Before were running out of time
Give me a reason to believe
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
We cannot wait till kingdom come!
Until were running out of time
Give me a reason to be strong
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
BEFORE I DIE!
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
Below me a kiss before I leave
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!
Give me a reason to believe
BEFORE, BEFORE I DIE!

We cannot wait till kingdom come!
