I love your plastic smile
And the pillows in your tits
Come on let's save up for a while
It's so easy to be twice that hip
The spokesman for the dumb
He used to be everybody's fool
As honest as a gun
Fraudulent but looks so cool

Fuck me in the face
Fuck my ears, motherfucker
Don't let go, teach me how to know better
Now fuck me in the face and don't forget my brain
Yeah fuck me in the face
And don't let go
Don't let me get away
And don't let go
Now fuck me in the face

Fuck me in the face

Plese, mommy, let me run
I wanna play the game the big boys play
Just pass me my toy gun
And drink yourself the pain away
Before we die and fall full of agony and hate
There's something to recall
Beyond this make up masquerede

Fuck me in the face
Fuck my ears, motherfucker
Don't let go, teach me how to know better
Now fuck me in the face and don't forget my brain
Yeah fuck me in the face
And don't let go
Don't let me get away
And don't let go
Now fuck me in the face

Fuck me in the face
And don't let go
Don't let me get away
And don't let go
Now fuck me in the face
And don't let go
And don't let go
Now fuck me in the face

Now fuck me in the face
