Come with me I come with you, La Bomba!
Come for me I come for you, La Bomba!
Come on me I come on you, La Bomba!
La Bomba! Explosion! Kaboom!

(You...)
I've been told that you are the best
In the things you do
Take control
(Hey you...)
Love the best, fuck the rest

Danger! Danger! Flames are blazin'
Let the fire roll and the sparks spring
Now back up, back up against the fire
Licking slowly

Danger, danger, detonation, bitch
Backstage fall in fulmination
Back off, back off, dynamite
It all sound tight

Run, babe, run!
We are dancing in the sun
And we make love like loaded guns
It's fulmicent
Rock, babe, rock!

Come with me I come with you, La Bomba!
Come for me I come for you, La Bomba!
Come on me I come on you, La Bomba!
La Bomba! Explosion! Kaboom!

(Youâ¦)
I've been told that you are the best
In the things you do
Take control
You are the best, fuck the rest

Danger! Danger! Kamikaze!
Let's fuck in the flashes of th paparazzi
Don't back off, show your back to me
Lay down and smell it

Come with me I come with you, La Bomba!
Come for me I come for you, La Bomba!
Come on me I come on you, La Bomba!
La Bomba! Explosion! Kaboom!

Run, babe, run!
We are dancing in the sun
And we make love like loaded guns
It's fulmicent
Rock, babe, rock!

Come with me I come with you, La Bomba!
Come for me I come for you, La Bomba!
Come on me I come on you, La Bomba!
La Bomba! Explosion! Kaboom!

Run, babe, run!
We are dancing in the sun
And we make love like loaded guns
It's fulmicent
Rock, babe, rock!

Run, babe, run!
Untill we're howling at the moon
After all is said and done
After all we have been through...

Come with me I come with you, La Bomba!
