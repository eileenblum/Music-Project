Raise your voice if you think you hate me
Raise your hands if you want to take me
Out of my misery
Wanna do good to me

Turned his head and I've got to turn mine
Wasted his and I'm wasting my time
I've had enough of wasting mine

I'm my my my my
my own shadow
And I hate the one I follow
The one I follow
And my my my my
my own shadow
Needs another one to follow
I'm not that hollow

Raise your finger if you're a hater
Raise your fist against your dictator
Come show me yours I'll show you mine

I'm my my my my
my own shadow
And I hate the one I follow
The one I follow
And my my my my
my own shadow
Needs another one to follow
I'm not that hollow

From the flame into the fire
I am paralyzed in my my my own shadow
From the rain into the flood
You'll find me paralyzed in my my my...
Can't break the shell
Of my own hell
I'm paralyzed in my own shadow
Raise your voice if you think you hate me
Raise your hands if you want to take me

I'm my my my my
my own shadow
And I hate the one I follow
The one I follow
And my my my my
my own shadow
Needs another one to follow
I'm not that hollow

I'm my my my my
my own shadow (my own shadow)
And I hate the one I follow (follow)
The one I follow (follow)
And my my my my
my own shadow (my own shadow)
Needs another one to follow (follow)
I'm not that hollow (hollow)
