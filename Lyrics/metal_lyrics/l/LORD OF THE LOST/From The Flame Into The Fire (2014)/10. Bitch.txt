Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
You'll learn to lose me
Bitch!
And you'll love me when it's over
Bitch!

I know that Lennon died and Morrisson is dead
I saw cobain losing his head
Life's a bitch
Where is the Nihilism?
Where does Nietzsche sway?
The devil moved out for Lavey
Life's a bicth
To be Bi, do you are or not to be
Time is winning anyway
In 2000 years of this cabaret
We'll need a Gaga-cross to pray

Life's a bitch
She's not a lover and not your friend (Recall)
Life's a bitch
Nothing more than a one-life-stand
Now you know better don't let her come too close
Just fuck her from behind and let her go (Recall)

Life's a bitch
She'll make you fall in love with her again
Life's a bitch

I still hear Jimi Shred
I Still see Janis dance
Buried alive in the blues
Life's a bitch
I'll never save the world
I'll ever be a salve
For a Mayfly Day
Life's a bitch
To be a lie, or not to be
Time is winning anyway
In 2000 years of this cabaret
We make the world a better place

One, Two
One, Two, fuck you!

Life's a bitch
She's not a lover and not your friend (Recall)
Life's a bitch
Nothing more than a one-life-stand
Now you know better don't let her come too close
Just fuck her from behind and let her go (Recall)

Life's a bitch
She'll make you fall in love with her again
Life's a bitch

Bitch!
Bitch!
Oh, Oh, Bitch!
I know that you don't love me
Oh, Oh, Bitch!
But you won't let me go

You'll learn to lose me and you'll love me when it's over

Life's a bitch
She's not a lover and not your friend (Recall)
Life's a bitch
Nothing more than a one-life-stand
Now you know better don't let her come too close
Just fuck her from behind and let her go (Recall)

Life's a bitch
She'll make you fall in love with her again
Life's a bitch

Bitch!
Bitch!
Oh, Oh, Bitch!
I know that you don't love me
Oh, Oh, Bitch!
But you won't let me go

Bitch!
