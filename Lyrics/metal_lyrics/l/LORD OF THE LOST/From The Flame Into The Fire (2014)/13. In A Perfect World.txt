Calling out, awoken people
Separating good from evil
Gather round, we the sheeple
You and I are one and equal
Wake up, It's all an illusion
Panic leads to mass confusion
Rise up, go against the grain
No more chemicals poisoning our brain

Stormy weather
You're never gonna learn
Lost forever
And you'll never know

In a perfect world hate would be cured
In a perfect world we'd suffer war, no more
In a perfect world, a world in which we're truly free
In a perfetc world so please release me

Dumbed down by your officials
Everything is artificial
Dumbfound by your dismissal
Too distracted by daily ritual

If the earth died would you even know?

In a perfect world, what's mine is yours
In a perfect world there'd be locked doors, no more
In a perfect world, a world in which we're truly free
In a perfetc world so please release me

Release me

In a perfect world all would be fair
In a perfect world strangers would share, they'd care
In a perfect world, a world in which we're truly free
In a perfetc world so please release me

If the world ends would you even know?
If the world dies them where will you go?
