[feat. Nina Jiers]When no one loves you and the world seems cold
Remember
No one but god will love you more
The say "All for one" but they mean "You for all"
Remember
No one but god will love you more
When you scream in your pillow with folded hands
Remember
No one but god will love you more
In the name of the father and his lustful friends
Remember
No one but them will love you harder
"Day and night
Destruction in delight
Let's party hard tonight"

Holy fuck, I'ts huge!

Hallelujah

One day we'll be enough to repulse
We come from hell and go to war

They say "What happens in V. Stays in V."
Remember
No one but god will love you more
They took your childhood away and gave you wisdom instead
Remember
No one but them will love you harder
"Gloom and doom
In the basement party room
Confession redeems us soon"

Holy fuck, I'ts huge!

Hallelujah

One day we'll be enough to repulse
We come from hell and go to war

Fuck you and your decalogue
Fallacious rules and "Bless the Lord"
In act of nature beyond control
Don't underrate the power of a broken soul

Hallelujah

One day we'll be enough to repulse
We come from hell and go to war

No one but god will love you more
No one but god will love you more
No one but god will love you more
No one but them will love you harder
