Deep in the night he appeared in my dreams
Promised me shelter and rise from debris

What do you want in return?

I'm the only one you love
I'm the only one you give
I'm the only one you trust till the last day you live
I'm your final chance before you're swept away by the floor
Don't be a fool and sign here with your blood

Go to hell and bring me back my soul
Once I sold it for fame and for gold
Go to hell bring the flame to Rome
Tell the devil I'm not coming home

When I woke up it was born in one me
I can't love anymore I'll never be free

And nothing left in return?

I'm your final destination
I'm your saviour from the dark
Don't be a fool and sign here with your blood

Go to hell and bring me back my soul
Once I sold it for fame and for gold
Go to hell bring the flame to Rome
Tell the devil I'm not coming home

Save my soul from the dark
Save my soul from the dark

Go to hell and bring me back my soul
Once I sold it for fame and for gold
Go to hell bring the flame to Rome
Tell the devil I'm not coming home

Go to hell and bring me back my soul
Once I sold it for fame and for gold
Go to hell bring the flame to Rome
Tell the devil I'm not coming home
