No one tells what we have to do
We say that no one tells
What is fake or true
We're singing "NO!"
We're singing "NO!"
Raise your Fists up in the Air!

We walk by ... - FIST UP!
And not by side - FIST UP!
Till the time is right
Ohhh!

We will not surrender - FIST UP!
We will stand as one - FIST UP!
We wonât break under torture - FIST UP!
We avow for what weâve become!
Ohh!

We are proud!
We are Strong!
Shout it out loud:
"WE ARE ONE!"

No one tells what we have to do
We say that no one tells
What is fake or true
We're singing "NO!"
We're singing "NO!"
Raise your Fists up in the Air!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fists up in the air!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fists up in the air!

We donât pray for forgiveness - FIST UP!
We wonât kneel down an lose - FIST UP!
We stand up for awareness - FIST UP!
Your stupidest is no excuse!

We are proud!
We are Strong!
Shout it out loud:
"WE ARE ONE!"

No one tells what we have to do
We say that no one tells
What is fake or true
We're singing "NO!"
We're singing "NO!"
Raise your Fists up in the Air!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fists up in the air!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
