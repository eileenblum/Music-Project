Kill, kill, kill
I need my fill. fill, fill!
Another we, Phil, not to go insane
I tried everything
And everything was trying me
but nothing set me free

You need me more than I am needing you
You love me more than I'm in love with you
So I am gonna do what I will have to do
To you

Kill it with fire
The monster waiting down under your bed
Kill it with fire
The monster, The Monster

Kill it with fire
The demon raging right inside your head
Kill it with fire
The monster
Kill, Kill, Kill it with fire
Kill it with fire

I fucked everyone and
Everyone was loving me
But no one set me free

You need me more than I am needing you
You love me more than I'm in love with you
So I am gonna do what I will have to do

Kill it with fire
The monster waiting down under your bed
Kill it with fire
The monster, The Monster (Kill)

Kill it with fire
The demon raging right inside your head
Kill it with fire
The monster
Kill, Kill, Kill it with fire

The monster, The monster
The monster
The monster, The monster
The monster

Kill it with fire
The monster waiting down under your bed
Kill it with fire
The monster, The Monster (Kill)

Kill it with fire
The demon raging right inside your head
Kill it with fire
The monster
Kill, Kill, Kill it with fire

Kill it with fire
The Monster (Kill)
Kill it with fire
