I said in good times as in bad
In light as in darkness
From the first kiss to your last breath
In light as in darkness

But too much is never enough
I'm digging my way to my work of art

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
So cold from your frozen heart

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
I'm loving you six feet underground

I kiss you bleak lips part by part
In light as in darkness
My favorite pieces Ã La Carte
In light as in darkness
My love will last longer than death
and night by night you'll be my skin and flesh

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
So cold from your frozen heart

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
I'm loving you six feet underground

But too much is never enough
I'm digging my way to my work of art

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
So cold from your frozen heart

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
I'm loving you

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
So cold from your frozen heart

Deep down in the dark
Loving you six feet underground
Enternal love
I'm loving six feet underground

Deep down in the dark
I'm loving six feet underground
