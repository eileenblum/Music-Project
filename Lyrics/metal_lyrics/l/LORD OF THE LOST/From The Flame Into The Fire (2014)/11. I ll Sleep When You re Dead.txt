[feat. Douglas Blair]You left me all alone
Broken, cold and bare
Open to the bone
Stuck in my despair
But one day I will rise
And I will hunt you
I will hunt you down

This is not the end

This is not the end
I'm finding you
This is not the end (Oh no!)
I'll sleep when you're dead
I will not give
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I'm only here to take
I'll sleep when you're dead

I won't find no sleep
Until you're passing on
Whatever makes you weak
Makes me feel so strong
And I will rise again
And I will hunt you
I will hunt you down

This is not the end

This is not the end
I'm finding you
This is not the end (Oh no!)
I'll sleep when you're dead
I will not give
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I'm only here to take
I'll sleep when you're dead

This is not the end
I'm finding you
This is not the end (Oh no!)
I'll sleep when you're dead
I will not give
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I'm only here to take
I'll sleep when you're dead

I'll sleep when you're dead
I'll sleep when you're dead
