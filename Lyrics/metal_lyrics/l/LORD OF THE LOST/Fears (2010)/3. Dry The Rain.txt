It's getting colder
And darker every day
And all the bloodred flowers
Slowly turn to grey

We need some wind
To blow the clouds away
we need a sun to dry the rain
We need to break the chain of yesterday
We need a storm to kill the pain

I don't remember
Nothing but a minor chord
There's still some ember
Of the fire you adored

We need some wind
To blow the clouds away
We need it today
We need it today
We need a sun
To dry the rain
To kill the pain
To kill the pain

And when the thunder opens hell
Walking down the border of farewell
I'd cut your hand off so I'd never let it go
Is this the final
The climax of the show
