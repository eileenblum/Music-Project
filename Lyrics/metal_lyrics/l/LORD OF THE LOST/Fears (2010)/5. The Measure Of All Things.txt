The one way out is through
The measure of all things
Is a love I seemed to lose
Seemed to abuse
But everything is clear somehow

The measure of all things
Is you
I want to believe
The only thing that's true
After all the measure will be you

You have set my place
Nothing I can't fight
In a world that I forsake
It's too late
But I don't fear it when I know

The only thing that's true

Many waters can't
Quench the love I feel
Neither floods can drown its scent
It never ends
And everything is even now

The measure will be you
