The night was black as coal, helpless like a child
With hands enchained and cold I was looking upï»¿ in fright
You are not from this world, you are born in the flames
And you're not from this world, oh please tell me your name
In a blaze ofï»¿ blinding white but I still saw as I closed my eyes
Time stand still
