You must break your heart

Don't you think I'm sorry, I'm scheming and so cold
I have lost my conscience but I never lose control
If you fall in love, don't give me your heart, but if you do so still

You must break your heart, don't lay it in my hands
Cause I will break your heart, don't you understand,
I will be your end

I can deal with pieces, I can deal with parts
But don't you give me everything, don't you go so far
If I touch you fondly, don't give in to me, but if you do so still

You must break your heart, don't lay it in my hands
Cause I will break your heart, don't you understand,

You must break your heart, don't lay it in my hands
Cause I will break your heart, don't you understand,
I will be your end

You must break your heart, don't lay it in my hands
Cause I will break your heart, don't you understand,

You must break your heart, don't lay it in my hands
Cause I will break your heart, don't you understand,

You must break your heart, don't lay it in my hands
Cause I will break your heart, don't you understand,
I will be your end

I will be your end
I will be your end
Don't you understand,
I will be your end
