Time is invincible
Fate is a story
But rain comes after the sun
We cannot avoid it
But I am not sure
If I am the bullet
The heart or the gun

Oh, my deepest fear
Is getting close
And I will lose myself in you
My deepest fear
And I do know
That I will lose you one day

The end unavoidable
My love unbreakable
But we are still on the run
Time is invincible
Fate is a story
But even sometimes
After rain comes the sun

Always be aware
So you can feel it
Always be scared
But never fear it
