You stand with grace and when you fall I'll follow
To be there in case, you're crying tears of sorrow
I will carry all that I can take, everything you might forsake
Up to the point of your escape and when you fall I'll follow you

Until my final breath I'll follow you in death
I'll follow you, cause you're to die for

You turned me around
At the point of no return
You gave me ground
And when you fall
I'll follow you
