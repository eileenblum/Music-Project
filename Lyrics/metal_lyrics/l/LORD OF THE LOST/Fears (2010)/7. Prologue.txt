Before my eyes I see you, I feel you, but still I can not have you
I want you to want me to want you, betray me, save me
Lying face down, below ground, my breakdown
No I don't, don't want you to tell me the hard truth
I beg you belie me, I suffer, just try me, betray me, save me
Lie to me, set me free
Lie to me, say that you're falling in love, save me from falling and falling apart
