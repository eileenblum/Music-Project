When every dream is lived
And every mask is worn
When every kiss is kissed
And every swear is sworn
I'll maybe find a reason
I'll maybe find a way
But it's nothing
Nothing words can say

At the end of the world
And it's cold outside
At the end of all times
In the desert of life
The end of the world
And the night of the day
But there's nothing to harm you
It's nothing words can say

When all the grace is falling
And when I feel so small
I might archive the wisdom
To know about it all
I'll maybe find the right words
I'll might know what to say
Oh, I will find
I will find a way

At the end of the world
And it's cold outside
At the end of all times
In the desert of life
The end of the world
And the night of the day
But there's nothing to harm you
It's nothing words can say
When it's cold outside
At the end of all times
In the desert of life
The end of the world
And the night of the day
But there's nothing to harm you
It's nothing words can say
