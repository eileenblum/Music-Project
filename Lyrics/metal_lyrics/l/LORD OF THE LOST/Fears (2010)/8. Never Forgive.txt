More than I can take, much more than I could ever swallow
Bigger than myself, too much, too deep, too far to follow
No, I give up
When I give up I know that you won't forgive me
Now I give up, and no, I will never forgive
The end of every night I wake up and die
Drowned in endless green, embraced by your eyes
