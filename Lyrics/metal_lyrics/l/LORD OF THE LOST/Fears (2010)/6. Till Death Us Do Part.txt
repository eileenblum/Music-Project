I walk this empty road
I'm leaving tomorrow and live for today
I am about to implode
When the void will take me away

Till death us do part
I wanna keep the pain alive
Till death us do part
When I'm dying in you're arms, in you're arms

When I don't feel your hand
There's still two pairs of footprints in the sand

I never know, no I never know,
What you ever know, what you never say
No I never know what you never say
It will take me away

Till death us do part
I wanna keep the pain alive
Till death us do part
When I'm dying in you're arms
Till death us do part
I wanna keep the pain alive
Till death us do part
When youÂ´re dying in my arms, in my arms

I never know, no I never know,
What you ever know, what you never say
No I never know what you never say
It will take me away

Till death us do part
I wanna keep the pain alive
Till death us do part
When I'm dying in you're arms
Till death us do part
When youÂ´re dying in my arms,
Till death us do part
I wanna keep the pain alive
Till death us do part

When we're dying in our arms, in our arms
