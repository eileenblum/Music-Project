When I leave and if you don't follow
I will learn to last and to swallow
All my fears and all of my sorrows
Better today instead of tomorrow

What if I weep and if I cry, if I beg and if I try
I stay in purgatory's pain, I'm beyond, I stay away

I'm not alive but I'm not in heaven, all of my sins won't be forgiven
I'm not in love cause I am the devil, I won't save instead I hate

When I fall and feeling so hollow, in the deep still being so shallow
When I leave and if you don't follow I will learn to last and to swallow
All my fears and all of my sorrows

I don't care instead I hate
