It could have made me believe
In everything I've lost
And all the things that I hate
It would have made me deceive
The only ones I trust
And glue the hearts that I break
My greatness
Is going to fall
My vagueness
Is killing them all
My sickness
Is coming from hell
I'm faceless
And silently saying farewell

These are my last words
Before I burn
No return

These are my last words
Before I die
No good bye

And all the walls will burn
And all the ravens will leave
The last chance to learn
To lose my lost belief
The last chance to see
The last chance to feel
The last chance
The last chance to be

Before I burn
