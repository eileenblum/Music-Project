Black Lolita â You're not a creature of god
Black Lolita â You have been sent from the dark
Black Lolita â Came to seduce and to trap
Black Lolita â Apples of eden in straps

I wanna penetrate your lips your hips your heart
I wanna do you in the backyard skid row
I wanna love you in your parents bedroom
You look so innocent but you're the devil

Black Lolita â I am a slave to your love
Lolita â I am a slave
A slave to your love

I wanna beat inside your chest your breasts your heart
I wanna crawl under skin and explode
I wanna pick you up when school is over
You give a helping hand but you're so evil

Black Lolita â I am a slave to your love
Lolita â I am a slave

And she tells me
I don't care I don't care how old you are
You are a slave to my love
I don't care I don't care how old you are
You will obey when I beg you to
Fuck me hard

I am a slave to your love
Lolita â I am a slave
A slave to your love
