I fucked your girlfriend in the washroom
I am her lover, her sinner, her killer and her priest
She even masturbates to this tune
But isn't, but isn't that the way you wanna be pleased

Do you love me do you love me do you do do do
If I don't give and never gave a fuck about the scene
Do you love me do you love me do you do do do
Shut up when you're talking to me

You only love me when I'm bad and mean
But will you love me when I'm sane and clean
I'll be everything you'll never be
But if you dare to judge me
Shut up when you're talking to me

I did your boyfriend just to unload
He is a lover, a sinner, an angel on his knees
The Lord is on his lips, in his throat
But isn't that the way you wanna see me?

Do you love me do you love me do you do do do
If I don't give a fuck if I'm the king if I'm the queen
Do you love me do you love me do you do do do
Shut up when you're talking to me

You only love me when I'm bad and mean
But will you love me when I'm sane and clean
I'll be everything you'll never be
But if you dare to judge me
Shut up when you're talking to me

Where do these scars come from â Did I hurt someone, oh no
Where do these scars come from â Do you know?
Where do these scars come from â Did I hurt someone, oh no
Where do these scars come from â I don't know

You only love me when I'm bad and mean
But will you love me when I'm sane and clean
I'll be your fetish and your life extreme
I'll be your memories, I'll live your dream
I'll be everything you'll never be
But if you dare to judge me
Shut up when you're...
