1 2 3 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
But you want more
1 2 3 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
Not more

Forever yours
From head to feet
Till the breaking down
In the lustful heat
Tonight I'll love you forever
When I go down and eat
Hot sweat in black leather
We're moving to the beat

1 2 3 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
But you want more
1 2 3 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
Not more
Until the end of night
I will always be your whore
Until the sun will shine
I give blood for blood
Not more

It's not a game
This love is true

When you scream my name
Both of you
You are going commando
Let us trick and treat
It takes two to tango
We're moving to the beat

1 2 3 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
But you want more
1 2 3 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
Not more
Until the end of night
I will always be your whore
Until the sun will shine
I give blood for blood
Not more
