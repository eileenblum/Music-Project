We wanna see your hands,
We wanna see you dance,
Like there is no tomorrow.

We wanna hear a yeah,
Don't wanna hear a no,
Now raise your hands.

Now let's go!

As soon as the night comes out,
You're getting dressed and leave the house,
You call your friends and getting cute,
In the crowd.

And as the haze will rise,
You lose your seatbelts for the flight,
We bop along and speed into,
The night.

We wanna see your hands,
We wanna see you dance,
Like there is no tomorrow.

We wanna hear a yeah,
Don't wanna hear a no,
Now raise your hands.

Now let's go!

Like there is no tomorrow.

Until the break of dawn,
When we will wake up with a yawn,
We hit the road to see you soon,
Ride on.

Just as the sun will fall,
We hear you entering the hall,
Cause friends to follow,
When friends do call.

We wanna see your hands,
We wanna see you dance,
Like there is no tomorrow.

We wanna hear a yeah,
Don't wanna hear a no,
Now raise your hands.

And let's go!

We feel your love,
We even love you more,
We feel your love,
We even love you more.

We wanna see your hands,
We wanna see you dance,
Like there is no tomorrow.

We wanna hear a yeah,
Don't wanna hear a no,
Now raise your hands.

You still can die tomorrow.
