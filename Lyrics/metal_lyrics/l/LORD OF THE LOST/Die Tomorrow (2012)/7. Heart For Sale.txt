And if you don't need my love
I'll give it all away

No one ever saw me
Nobody ever cared
No one ever stole my heart
And left the half unpaired

Spring went by
Summer lead to fall
In winter's night
A devil in the sky
And after all
The agonies and fears
Did someone hear my call
And came to dry my tears
Or let me fall?

And if you don't need my love
I'll give it all away
And if you refuse I prostitute
My heart for sale
I prostitute my heart for sale

No one ever listened
Or spoke once in a while
No one ever touched my heart
But left me undefiled

Spring went by
Summer lead to fall
In winter's night
A devil in the sky

And if you don't need my love
I'll give it all away
And if you refuse I prostitute
My heart for sale
And if you don't need my love
I'll give it all away
And if you refuse I prostitute
My heart for sale

In agonies and fears
Will someone hear my call
And come to dry my tears
Or let me fall?

(My love...)
I prostitute my heart for sale
(And if you don't need my love)
I give it all, I give it all away
