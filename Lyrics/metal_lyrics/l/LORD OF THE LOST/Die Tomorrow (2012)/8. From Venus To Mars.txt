In this world â I'm a stranger
I am lost in memories â All around me
I see danger â And too much reality

But time will tell
And we will cross the bridge
When we find it and step on it
You take my fate in your hands
You say that we have to be strong or we will die

I want to fly from venus to mars
I want to slide across the stars
I want to fly forever so far
Until the day I die in your arms
In your arms

I'm afraid â Sad and angry
I have nothing in my hands
I've been pure â Like a newborn
Now the devil invites to dance

But time will heal
And we will cross the bridge
Set it on fire and bury it
We run and leave this land
You say that we have to be strong or we will die

I want to fly from venus to mars
I want to slide across the stars
I want to fly forever so far

Until the day I die in your arms
I want to fly from venus to mars
I want to slide across the stars
I want to fly forever so far
Until the day I die in your arms

We never get our feet back on the ground
Never settle down
We never walk again if we can run
Into the sun

I want to fly from venus to mars
I want to slide across the stars
I want to fly forever so far
Until the day I die in your arms
