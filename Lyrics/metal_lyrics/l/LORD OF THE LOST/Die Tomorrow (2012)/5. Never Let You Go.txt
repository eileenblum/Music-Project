[feat. Ulrike Goldmann Of Blutengel]I will never let you go

Love hurt me â For better or worse I'll be here
(Cause you're the beauty, a beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me â My heart will engulf yours my dear
(Cause you're the beauty, a beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me â The walls of temptation grow higher
(Cause you're the beauty, a beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me â We're risking it all for destruction and desire

No way out and no way back
A bride in white a dress so red
No I will never let you go
Oh I will never let you
I will never let you go

Love hurt me â A gloss on your lips as you leave
(Cause you're the beauty, a beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me â I'm saving the rest of your blood red sweat for me

No way out and no way back
A bride in white a dress so red
No I will never let you go
Oh I will never let you
I will never let you go

Don't leave your vow unspoken
Now that I step into the light
I will never let you go
Just take my true love token
Hold me and kiss me goodbye

No way out and no way back
A bride in white a man in black
No I just couldn't let you go
Oh I will never let you
I will never let you go
