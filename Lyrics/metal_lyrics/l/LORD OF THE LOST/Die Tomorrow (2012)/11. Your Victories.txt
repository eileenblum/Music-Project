We do not play the title role
We are no longer in control
We came from eden, eden
Since the fall of man
We're bleeding, bleeding
We were believing,
Leaving all our moves to god
Now the shit will hit the fan

We do not want your victories
We don't need your surrender
We did not choose your victories
We pick return to sender

The fire creeps from pole to pole
Evoke the dark deep pitch black hole
You set the needle, needle
To crusade against all evil, evil
But we're all equal, equal
In atomic sun
The second fall of man

We do not want your victories
We don't need your surrender
We did not choose your victories
We pick return to sender

The whole world is in flames
It never can be tamed again
Is this the price you have to pay
You're just one victory away

We do not want your victories
We don't need your surrender
We did not choose your victories
We do not want your victories

We don't need your surrender
We did not choose your victories
We pick return to sender

We do not we do not...
