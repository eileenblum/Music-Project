Thrown in icy waters
Underneath the waves
Sinking mesmerized...

I'm your heavy anchor
Where the light can't conquer
Oh, we were meant to drown...

I am...I'm your enemy
When you're powerless
I'm your enemy

In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light

I hold all your secrets
Underneath my skin
Faith is hope in bleakness

I am...I'm your enemy
When you're powerless
I'm your enemy

In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
In darkness, in light
