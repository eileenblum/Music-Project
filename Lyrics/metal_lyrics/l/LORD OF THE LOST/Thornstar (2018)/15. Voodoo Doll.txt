The pearl for the heart
And buttons for the eyes
Stuffed inside with cloves and spices
Chant your words in the night
With needle and thread
Sown together your strange devices

But I don't feel these pins and needles
These pins and needles
You have no power here
No I don't feel you anymore

The black magic can't control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway
So go ahead, carve your candle
With love I will burn the white handle
This is my life after all
I'm not your voodoo doll

With your old book of spells
And strands of my hair
You whisper the incantation
It's your remote control
Over my heart and soul
My behavior is your creation

But I don't feel these pins and needles
These pins and needles
You have no power here
No I don't feel you anymore

The black magic can't control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway
So go ahead, carve your candle
With love I will burn the white handle
This is my life after all
I'm not your voodoo doll
I'm not your voodoo doll
I'm not your voodoo doll
Voodoo doll

I don't belong to anyone
I'm not a puppet with my strings in your hand
I don't belong to anyone
I won't obey your commands

The black magic can't control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway

The black magic can't control me
And no curse can let you own me
There's nothing you can do or say
I'm just gonna do it anyway
So go ahead, carve your candle
With love I will burn the white handle
This is my life after all
I'm not your voodoo doll
Voodoo doll
I'm not your voodoo doll
Voodoo doll
Voodoo doll
