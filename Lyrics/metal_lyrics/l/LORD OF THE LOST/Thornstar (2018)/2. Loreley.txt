She knows her grief is a beast
That kills from inside
She lifts the souls from their home
At aerial high tide

No moments alone, no sorrow to share
In search of a key you know is not there
Oh no, Lorelei

With arms to the sky
And dreams in the dirt
Being stronger than death
Does not heal the hurt

Oh no, Lorelei Lorelei

Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei
Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei

She's starved of light no respite
Each breath's a burden
Time can't reverse her grim curse
Of life eternal

No moments alone, no sorrow to share
In search of a key you know is not there
Oh no, Lorelei, oh no, Lorelei

Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei
Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei

Scream for me
Scream for me
Scream for me
Scream for me

Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei
Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei
Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei
Cry Lorelei, cry for Eden Lorelei
Cry for Eden, Lorelei, Lorelei, Lorelei
