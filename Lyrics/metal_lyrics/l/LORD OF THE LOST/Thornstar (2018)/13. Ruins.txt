They walked this withered wasteland
The taste of ash in every breath
A violent past forsaken
The creeds did breed contempt

Seeking grace and beauty in the wreckage
Pure wisdom hides away in the decay
The shadowed truth foretold the message
The darkest heart can lead the right way

Here in ruins life still grows
Here in ruins, a blooming rose
Here in ruins love remains
We will rise again

So don't let your downfall be destiny
Don't blame the stars
So don't let your downfall be destiny
The moment is ours

All monuments now remnants
The grandiose reduced to dust
Those sacred names abolished
This future we must trust

It is our duty to replenish
Envisage life eclipsing death and fate
From sallow youth to the decrepit
The tarnished start to reason faith

So don't let your downfall be destiny
Don't blame the stars
So don't let your downfall be destiny
The moment is ours

Here in ruins life still grows
Here in ruins, a blooming rose
Here in ruins love remains
We will rise again

Hope is here, so near
Hope is here, a new life
Hope is here, so near
Hope is here, a new life

So don't let your downfall be destiny
Don't blame the stars
So don't let your downfall be destiny
The moment is ours

I walk this withered wasteland
A sense of purpose in each step
Wherever this path takes us
We'll tread with pure intent
