I sold my soul to the lowest bidder
I know my worth and which pain pacifies
We sealed the deal and then they halved the figure
There's hope when visions are destroyed

Indebted to this stark depraved opponent
And I will not forget
In every one of these sadistic moments
Their stench of wine and toxic sweat

I found my foe
An external evil
Bloodstreams will flow
Love's hateful glow

I see control in the malicious mirror
Not since my birth I have felt this alive
A shield I wield against a world embittered
By how the weird find their ways to thrive

I found my foe
An external evil
Bloodstreams will flow
Love's hateful glow

A place to go
No infernal needle
To force below
The fateful show

Those hallowed words
They hold no mystique here
My madness works
Trust my methods

I found my foe
An external evil
Bloodstreams will flow
Love's hateful glow

A place to go
No infernal needle
To force below
The fateful show
