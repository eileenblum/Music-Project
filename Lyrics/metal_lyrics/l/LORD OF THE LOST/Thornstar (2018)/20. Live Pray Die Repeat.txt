I am caught in a vile dilemma condemned to death every fucking day
Then I wake up and I'm back to the morning
The same old same
Live, pray, die, repeat

Stupid quirks and irksome faces, all that I now know
My endless life is like a sentence spent on death row

The worst kind of immortal, alone and praying for a change
And you know no-one will hear you in a million years
Live, pray, die, repeat
The first time was torture, so kill me now

I've had it all, I've self combusted
Shot by a nun and choked on red wine
Tripped on a kerb, drowned in a duck pond
To my despair
Life goes on, life goes on

So I turned to bloody murder of those I despise
Come the morbid sunlit dawn and there still alive

The worst kind of immortal, alone and praying for a change
And you know no-one will hear you in a million years
Live, pray, die, repeat
The first time was torture, so kill me now

I've had it all, stabbed in a library
Plain as a grave the reaper drops by
Crushed by a hearse, mauled by mad swan
To my despair
Life goes on, life goes on

People think they are living
Lost to life, hunched over screens
The beauty that they're missing
I swear it's truly obscene

I was so bored, tried suicide but
Only to learn that I was denied
There's no escape, routine has become beyond repair
Life goes on, life goes on
