Fate will echo between the worlds
Through the shores of the fallen souls
To this land that I served with pride
Visions clear in the fading light.

And we walk through the shadows of pain
Come and walk with me...to the end!

All is condemned!
So...walk to the end!
Free from regret!
Yet...will I ascend to her?

Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?

Bodies wilt but the mind's serene...
For a life worthy of her grace...
My desire as I depart
Give my piece back to her
Lone heart...to the end!

All is condemned!
So...walk to the end!
Free from regret!
Yet...will I ascend to her?

Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?

I have to run through
The shadows of hate
To be hers again...to the end!

All is condemned!
So...walk to the end!
Free from regret!
Yet...will I ascend to her?

Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
