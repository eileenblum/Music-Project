Pointing downwards towards the stars
With a rhythm unnatural
A union lost to the gun
The three in me, the two in you

To the slaughterhouse give peace and harmony
Just look but do not touch, come taste the mercury
I'm sleeping in my care, a liquid prisoner
Four limbs, one single head, thus we are circular, so...

Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain

Vulnerable when in reverse
The leather apron ripped to shreds

Nothing's beautiful and everything is hurt
Undo the wounds add up in hideous winter lair
May the gentle work to the second rule
On a perfect scale change is radical, so...

Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain

To the slaughterhouse give peace and harmony
Just look but do not touch, come taste the mercury
I'm sleeping in my care, a liquid prisoner
Four limbs, one single head, thus we are circular

Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted
Pain should not, should not be wasted

Nothing's beautiful and everything is hurt
Undo the wounds add up in hideous winter lair
May the gentle work to the second rule
On a perfect scale change is radical
