Sentenced to death every day
My blood in leaks has dried
Sentenced to death, no hope in sight
Too weak to even try

Blending ways, fusing hearts
Memories, never ending scars

Eyes to see and hands to touch
A past to leave behind
Destroy the need to rule and judge
A future undefined
The art of love

Sentenced to death a thousand years
A billion times I've prayed
Sentenced to death, blind, deaf and numb
A shadow of myself

Don't believe, don't go astray
Don't give in, don't lead me away

Eyes to see and hands to touch
A past to leave behind
Destroy the need to rule and judge
A future undefined
The art of love

Eyes to see and hands to touch
A past to leave behind
Destroy the need to rule and judge
A future undefined
The art of love
