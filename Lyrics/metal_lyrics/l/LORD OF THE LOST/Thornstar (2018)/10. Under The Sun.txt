We long for redemption
A natural discipline
Her prestige â our purpose
But passions do lurk within

Am I weak and given to lust?
Am I strong to do what I must?

Morgana, forgive!
Oh, Morgana, forgive!

Under the sun we all share the glow
But some of us feel the black heat of true low

Falling free from the orbit of lies
Loveless dreams when I close my eyes
Under the sun

Under the sun
Under the sun

There's a point before the deed to which you can't return
When thoughts bleed into action
Guilt finds a heart to burn

Am I weak and given to lust?
Am I strong to do what I must?

Under the sun we all share the glow
But some of us feel the black heat of true low

Falling free from the orbit of lies
Loveless dreams when I close my eyes
Under the sun

Morgana, forgive!
Oh, Morgana, forgive!

Under the sun we all share the glow
But some of us feel the black heat of true low

Falling free from the orbit of lies
Loveless dreams when I close my eyes
Under the sun

Under the sun
Under the sun
Under the sun
Under the sun
