How can I retake you when you turn your back on me
You left me alone in the darkest hour (the darkest hour)
Is there a place where we could find, find our love again
It's beaten and bruised, but the only thing given to us

Powerless, naked, on my knees
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

Too much, too soon, too high on fire
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

Forgive me, forgive me
Let the tears fall down like rain
Forgive me, forgive me
And I love you till the end

Fear casts the longest shadow
Turning your heart into glass
No, don't you move or we both will break

We can't go on in this thunderstorm
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

No chance for us we're too high on fire
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out (on fire)

Forgive me, forgive me
Let the tears fall down like rain
Forgive me, forgive me
And I love you till the end

We can't go on, a last kiss in the storm
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

One day reborn, one star and one thorn
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out
Don't cut me, cut me, cut me out

Let the tears down like rain

Forgive me, forgive me
Let the tears fall down like rain
Forgive me, forgive me
And I love you till the end
