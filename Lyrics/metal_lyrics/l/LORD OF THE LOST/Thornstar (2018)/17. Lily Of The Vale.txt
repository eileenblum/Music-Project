DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISPLEASURE, DESOLATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, FOREVER

This is your nightmare, this is the prize
We set a fire inside the core of the bee hive
All that glitters has been oversold
We pull the plug out of the pontifical old

Where do you come from?
Where do we go?
Don't blindly believe
What you've been told

DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISPLEASURE, DESOLATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, FOREVER

Be keen and hungry, be proud and brave
We break the prison bars and bust the pious cage
We are the animal, we are with young
We are the ones who were, who are and are to come

DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISPLEASURE, DESOLATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, FOREVER

Where do you come from?
Where do we go?
Don't blindly believe
What you've been told

DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISPLEASURE, DESOLATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, DISMEMBER, DEVASTATE
DESTROY, DESTRUCT, FOREVER
