Born a child of the night and that stain taints forever
Black of heart and the dark is the one place you treasure
There is not one legend who has wasted life
Wishing worth beyond earth is absurd in the never, death won't die

So close to heaven and so damn far from God
Lost to the shadows, just ashes in the dust

He will creep as you sleep, take your dreams and debase them
Traumatized, your demise is his prize when awakened
There is not one legend who'd not realized
The deceased find no peace in the place where he takes them

So close to heaven and so damn far from God
Lost to the shadows, just ashes in the dust

The wind's an omen, one soul is stolen
The wind's an omen, one soul is gone

So close to heaven and so damn far from God
Lost to the shadows, just ashes in the dust
So close to heaven and so damn far from God
Lost to the shadows, just ashes in the dust

Dragging down is effortless, lifting up takes love
Dragging down is effortless. welcome to the dust
