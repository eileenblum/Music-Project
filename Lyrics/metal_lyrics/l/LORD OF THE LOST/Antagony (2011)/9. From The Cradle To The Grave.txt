I will do what you say, Give order, I will obey

We're not allowed to sin we must not kill
No one gets what one deserdes
We are confessing and we break our will
We will submit , We're born to serve
The 'lie' in belief is just a word
the truth is written between the lines
But words should purify us from the dirt
In this we trust cause we're afraid to die

You are the leader and I'll always by a slave
I'm gonna live it from the Cradle to the Grave

In the Face of death we wont complain
But if we suffer we might break the spell
Even dying won't release us from this shame
And in devotion we go the hell

I won't question what you say, Give order, I will obey

I'll do what you say and I will obey
I'll follow from the Cradle to the Grave
