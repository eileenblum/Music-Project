Walk on Baby
Let me see you heat
Come on spread the fire
Force me down on my knees
Walk on Baby
Let me see your heat
Come on spread the fire

Entrap the devil into the fire
I wanna see flow out in flames
It's going down to wire
I'm trapped
I'm in the game

Walk on
Don't keep the flesh together
Oh I would kill for what I want
Between your legs forever
Don't say that I'm the only one
Scream that you come
And then I leave to walking on
You're sex on legs

Walk on Baby
Let me see you heat
Come on spread the fire
Force me down on my knees
Each ware will find an eager buyer
Seductive angel in the eyes of god
Your things are even there for hire
I'm going avantgarde

I am gagged between your heat
You know I'm not here to talk
After I licked dry your leak
I just want to see you walk

You're not the only one

I'm not the only one
