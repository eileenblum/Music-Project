I have walked in line, I have made my confession to erase my guilt
I have been aligned, but nowâs the time

I want to know whatâs behind the end, will I rise or will I descend
Is there a savior to take me away to a better place

No, no one is coming to save you and allay you, and no one is safe
I know itâs too late, oh no, they only come to enslave you and to slay you
Donât try to escape, be sure itâs too late for you

I want to know whatâs between the lines
Iâve been infernal, Iâve been divine
But all the prideful go down to hell
Am I safe down there when I cross the line
