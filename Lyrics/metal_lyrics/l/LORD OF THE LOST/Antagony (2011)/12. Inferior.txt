I see the years passing by
We're trapped in the tunnel of time
I remember us living in fire
You devoured me ate me alive
The day turns to night and love dies

Someone taught me how to pray
I can not remember that day
Someone told me not to cry
I stopped counting hours and nights
When I learned to recover and fight

I wanna fight for the one I love
I wanna fight for the one I love
Always for you

I'm a glutton for hard punishment
I need to feel the wrenching end
I never do want it all
But still I do fight for some more
I feel how I rise when you fall

I wanna fight for the one I love
I wanna fight for the one I love
I wanna fight for the one I love
I wanna fight for the one I love
Always for you

Malice is keeping me low
My conscience is black as a crow
The devil inside me will grow
If you won't survive I don't know
I was yours now you're mine
Quid pro quo

I wanna fight for the one I love
I wanna fight for the one I love
Always for you
