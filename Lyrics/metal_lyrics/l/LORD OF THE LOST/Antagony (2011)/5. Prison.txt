Fragile hands laying in mine
hollow eyes too weak to shine
the color of love is red
what if you are colorblind?

[Chorus:]
What is heaven for?
What is life meant to be?
What is heaven for?
Is it a prison where you canÂ´t break free?

Dawn is opening my eyes
IÂ´m still dreaming in disguise
All the stories have been told
ThereÂ´s nothing left to touch a heart
that is so cold

[Chorus]

What is heaven for? [4x]
Set it on fire and watch it burn [3x]
set it on fire
DonÂ´t let it freeze with no return
Set it on fire and watch it burn
from the ashes, from the dust
I save your heart
It never can be hurt again

[Chorus]

What is heaven for? [4x]

[Chorus]
