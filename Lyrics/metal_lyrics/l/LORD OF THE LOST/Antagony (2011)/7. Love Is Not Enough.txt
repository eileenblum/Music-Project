Your love is not enough
I need to murder you to feel secure
The Surface of Love is rough
The State of Death is honest and pure
When I kiss you I feel that youÂ´re lying
You will be the death of me

Your love is not enough
I need to murder you to feel secure
Your love is not enough
I kill you first because I donÂ´t trust you

Your death is not enough
I need to follow you to feel secure
When you kiss me I feel that IÂ´m dying
You will be the death of me

Dying together is tough
I kill you first Â´cause I need to be sure
The Surface of Love is rough
The State of Death is honest and pure
