I have reached the bottom
I can't see the sky
I am down so low
Wanna be so high

I am running down
On a dead end road
In my search for love
Iâve reached the overload

I'm not strong enough for love
Iâm not brave enough to die
I donât dare to cut my wrist
I turn away and clench my fist
And sign the contract with the Lord of Lies

When the rain has dried
In this tragedy
I live the faustian lie
To pretend Iâm free
