It was one of these days, the right and the left grew apart
It was fear in my face, I felt a hole where I had a heart
I saw all of it fading away
Breeding flowers inside pitch black caves
I knew heaven and hell has been lies
I surrendered and turned out the lights

Itâs the seven days of Anavrin for you to leave the world behind us
Seven days of Anavrin, the treasure of you and me will find us

The right hand tries to control but the left hand bears the strength
Let it go, nothingâs gonna change
Now revive the Abel in Caine

Days of Anavrin
Iâm falling here into you
The first day of Anavrin
Is the last one I see you
