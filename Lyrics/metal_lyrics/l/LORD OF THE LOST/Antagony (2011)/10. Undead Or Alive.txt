Tell me about your dreams, we can make them memories
Tell me about your lies, I will believe them bona fide

I want, I want, I want you to beg me, I want, I want your devil inside

Tell me about your dreams, we can make them memories
Iâm showing you how sweet and satiating life can be
If youâre undead or alive, Iâm fucking you to death

Tell me about addictions, tell me about obsessions, I realize your fictions, I satisfy suppression

Sex, death &amp; rockânâroll
