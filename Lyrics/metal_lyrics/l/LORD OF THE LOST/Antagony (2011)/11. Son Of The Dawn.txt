When the full moonâs rising and I hear him call
Iâm gonna cut my wings and fall

How did you fall from heaven,
O morning star, son of the dawn
Cast down to the ground
And you said in your heart
You will ascend and raise your throne on tears of stone
I harbour iron will under my skin
And I gave birth to you out of the sin

When the full moonâs rising and I hear him call
Iâm gonna cut my wings and fall and fall and fall
When my bones are tumbling from the sky so high
Iâm gonna break the chain and fly

You were brought down to the grave
A perfect place right in the sun
Forever lasting doom
And when the sun is low one can see a falling star
Beside the moon
