I make you undone, I am the reaper
Donât try to run, youâre just a creeper when I come

My heart bleeds for you, but Iâm not gracious
I envy you, I want to be mortal just like you

And donât be afraid, itâs over by now
Youâre starting to fade, beginning to drown
And life is too short, youâre praying for grace
Youâre begging for love, for mildness

The day you die, I will kiss you
I hear you sigh, the curse of me will be the curse of you

I erase you

Pain â afraid, lifelong, decay, when I come
