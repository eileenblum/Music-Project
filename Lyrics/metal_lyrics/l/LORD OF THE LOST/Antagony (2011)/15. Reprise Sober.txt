I have reached the bottom
I can't see the sky
I am down so low
Wanna be so high

I'm not strong enough for love
I am trying to get sober
I can never get enough
I am trying to get in touch
Not just waiting till it's over

I have reached the bottom
I have touched the ground
All my plans forgotten
All my courage down

All these empty faces
They're just walking by
I don't even care
I can't even cry
