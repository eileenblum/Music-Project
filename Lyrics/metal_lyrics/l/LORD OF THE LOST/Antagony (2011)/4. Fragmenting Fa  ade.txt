Every day I ask you what is it for
Though you have everything.
You are crying for more
Your whole attitude is mindless and vague
You're too afraid to escape
From this life masquerade.
Where do I belong? I don't know
In what do I believe? If nothing is true
Where do I come from? Where should I go?
What should I do?

I'm not a part of you.
Your cruel facade isn't true.
I'm not a part of you.
I want to see something new.

I woke up and stopped believing your lies.
My defined admiration turned into despise.
If I'm not like you it cannot be right
But when it's your own fault
You just close your eyes
Tell me is it right oder is it wrong?
When I feel weak should I be strong?
What should I do? Who should I be?
Where do I belong?

I'm not a part of you.
Your lies tell you what to do.
I'm not a part of you.
I want to see something new

Lies and hate
Masquerade them with lies and hate
I will break it down, break it all down
Lies and hate
Masquerade them with lies and lies
