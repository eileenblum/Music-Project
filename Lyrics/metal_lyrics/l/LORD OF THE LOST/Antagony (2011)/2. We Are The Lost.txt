I wanna crawl inside
And make you feel
I wanna kiss the scars
That never heal
I close the door
And lock it from inside
I break the key
I'm blacking out the light

We are the lost
We are the crack
Inside your heart.

In the unstoppable end
I will love you
Or at least I pretend
I strip you off to the bones
I clothe your heart in my skin
You will never be alone

When you can't stand it anymore
I open hell when heaven calls
