Experimental malediction.
Destructive minds.
Seeking places no living can find.
Awaiting darkness, transcending, venture into the night.

I hide within places unknown,
There was nothing else to do.
With sorrow and hatred burning inside.
The suffering was endless.
Mementos undivine.
The bleeding scenarios,
The reservoirs of shame.
Damned in misanthropic fires,
The soul dwelled.

The feelings for mankind was gone.
And so was the values of life.
There was only a final wish,
Death before a living hell.
