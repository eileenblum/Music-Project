A thousand years time dimension
In subconscious incarceration.
My hatred to man, has transformed me.
Into a habitation, for demons.
A devil incarnation.

In the forgotten past, ages ago, beast became
My alter ego.

The god in me, infernal black divinity.
After years of agony and pain.
Hatred is all that remain

Into the dazzling light of the world, I proceed
As stagnant shadows comes alive
In stench of stone cold death I arrive

From the shades of hatred
