Dominus Spiritus Sathanas, Dominus Virtus
Dominus Spiritus Virtus Sathanas

Cruel are the eyes of the tyrant
And his heart is abounded to pain
In pleasures of agony and torture
As he begs to bleed in vain

I perish in my own desire
I burn within lusting hate
Destructively the minds inspire
The soul to terminate

I ride the ancient overture
As life is torn astray
I glance the illusive spectrum
And all high that fades away

Black energies in the twilight space
Comes shieving through the shallow haze
Into darkness so impure divine
A bloodshed emotion to evil wine

Darkzone martyrium, endless vast mystrium
Give to me the blessing, when I meet my destiny

Ruin is all there is to feel, and thecold reality of steel

Life slips through your fingers
