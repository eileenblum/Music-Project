The sky is darkening soon the night befall
Righteously angels are weeping for my soul
All childhood dreams are soon to be lost
All innocence to be shattered

I am the fallen, from grace

Water from a thousand tears floats in streams
The feeling from a thousand years flow over me
As I once again return to the cemetery gale
I hear the dismal call from the hollow grave

My face is a river
See my eyes as they drown in black
My sacred doom and nemesis
Beneath the burial surface
To the final act of the immortal sin
I am lead by burial winds

The life I leave to exchange with death
As the charlatan breeds with a dragons breath
Crossing the path to the world below
In a deathlike silence I chamber my soul

Ancient black, silent gloom
Cathedral bells are calling doom
In velvet dreams I am touched by sin

As night arrives in its purple shades
I drift across the shallow graves
The soul is streaming in the wind
Dark is the blessing that I am in

As darkness falls and the cold silence reigns
The nocturnal void shall become my faith
Till transcend unto where shadows dance

A gentle kiss and like a bird
Till fly
Into the spheres of demise
Desirously in dark romance
