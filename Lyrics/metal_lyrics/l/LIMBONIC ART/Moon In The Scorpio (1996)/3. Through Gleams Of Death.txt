The truth is hidden
In the cold dark water
In the drowning of procedure
The flesh gets slaughtered

Stripped from mortality
Into gleams of death
Torn from reality
Into terminal death

Death is eternal art
From whom that coldness reigns in heart

Stars of damnation
Blaze in my sight
I view the constellation
Beyond the dazzling light

From the dark aspects of life
And through gleams of death
Till rise drift in departure
Into a new dimension

The black voyage
Into mega therion
The unseen passage
Into oblivion

Unconscious secrets
Concealed by time and space
No return of regrets
Descent through shallow haze
[Repeat chorus]
