[2001 Remaster Bonus Track]the death of memories
is burning in the past
"in abruptum trahi"
the blasphemous holocaust

I am born into the darkness and misanthropy
under triumphs of death and agony

the deep churnal seas
a dark cold astral void
within the blackness of sorrow
where happiness once was destroyed

I am the tempting evil in forces and streams
returned to surrender in a vast disharmony
the great captured spirit recalls
as the darkened shadow unfolds

where its necromancy lives forever
I wonder in twilight shimmering
by the lake of bleeding art
the sore energy is shivering

in the zone where shadows meet
I gather sources to complete
by the dark rivers of the heart
in the present of defeat

I am watching dreams fall apart
until death do us apart...
