In sarcophagus sleep embraced by night so mystic deep
Through my minds I see from the grace of clairvoyancy
Into the secret garden of disharmonia
Black antique chambers of morbid euphoria

As a precursor of death my ghoul proceed
In black cosmic material and sepulchral symphonies
I cross dimensions unseen to ride on the axis of dreams
