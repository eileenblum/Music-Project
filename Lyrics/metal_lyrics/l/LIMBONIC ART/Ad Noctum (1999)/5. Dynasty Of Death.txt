I'm launching into
The abysmaluniverse
Disembodied I enter
The cosmic cataclysm

I discover stairways
To celestial dreamscapes
A dark unknown conjunction within in immoral dimension

Locus reconditus occulta tenebrarum

As all the worlds collide
And the heavenly sky divide
I live only to see the
Last star descend
From above as the
Mortal  journey end
The genesis of the
Dynasty of death

Through dark tunnels
In levitation
Black cosmic space
In manifestation
I escape the earthly pandemonium
Into a vast nocturnal sanctum
A nemesis for all evil I confess
My soul bleeds by all the forces I possess
A benediction of unholy
Wrath and sorrow
My heart is buried in dark
Catacombs of horror

Sucked into that hole
That deep black hole
Not for a thousand years
Will I manage to crawl
Out of this darkness
All the vibes are insane
In the wilderness of pain

Dungeon darkness
In violent fire
Transfix the soul
With hell's desire
Where myriad's of lives
Are laid in ruins
Dormant in the ashes of
All terrestrial dreams

The dynasty of death

In the dark caves of oblivion
Bad blood rises from
The Mega Therion
From vast stalactite halls
So undivine
Through the misty
Corridors of time
As one live one shall die

Ad noctum
