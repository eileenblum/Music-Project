Thought are tyrants
That always return
To rape and torment the heart
As darkness sweeps
The face of Earth
I enter the chambers
Of bleeding art

I receive a black picture
Of the future
Shockwaves attack from
A nihilistic universe
Another icon shattered,
Drown in gory failure
The supreme sacrifice
Done in hatred's curse

The will to power
Fades slowly out

It was so my fate
To crawl among reptiles
Epitaphs was carved
Deep into the core
Of the living memories
My spirit was awaiting
The incinerator
No anxiety, no pain
Just everlasting sleep

When you seek the dawn of light
From the cold dungeons of night
The world is caught in a spell
Where dreams have become hell

Psycological autopsy,
Spirally depression
Darkness takes its prey
Psycological autopsy,
Spirally depression
End the life and earthly mission

As I found peace in
Death's challenge
The world remained
In a rotten stench

Psycological autopsy,
Spirally depression
Darkness takes its prey
Psycological autopsy,
Spirally depression
End the life and earthly mission

I stand within the flame
Watch the wisdom be discovered
When life and death is the same
I am devoured

So many nights I have spent
In thoughts not heaven sent
Blood of hatred
Poured down like rain
For evil secrets insane
In silent gloom
I kneeled obsessed
Channeling  the
Enigmatic darkness
My soul, the servant
Under the illusive wings of death

When I receive a black
Picture of the future
And schockwaves attack from a nihilistic universe
My body, the temple,
A mausoleum in flesh
Under the illusive wings of death
