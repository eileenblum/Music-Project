By dawn's early light
I see no end to the
Dark obsession
I am swallowed by night's
Infernal dream profession
O' sea of fire, all hatred's desire
Thy abhorrent cremation
Sparks in my eyes
Forces generates from
The bottomless pits
Of detestation

Under the delusion of hatred
The becoming of a
Malignant tormentor
In a spell of
Symptomatic madness
I identify with aggressor
This world will become
Infernal land
A violation of harmony
As I kill with a psychic command
Destruction let all pain fly free

The metamorphosis
From man to beast

In the darkened
Network of the mastermind
Evil is blooming in the shades of divine
For within every seed
There is a promise
Of abomination
In my heart's enigma,
Man is an anathema

I am a resistance fighter
Not by choice but by destiny
Evil is a pure exciter
When I dwell in embers
Of infernal greed

Fire of blasphemy,
Evil against all energy

I rise from the darkened soil
With a craving to ingest
Where moonlight ever
Shall infest

In my heart's enigma
Man is an anathema
In embers of infernal greed
