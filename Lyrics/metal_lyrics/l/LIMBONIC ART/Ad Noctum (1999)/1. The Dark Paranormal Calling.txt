I cross dimensions unseen to ride on the axis of dreams
As I drift on through the dark corridors of post mortem
The only light in the darkness
Is the flame that burns
In my soul

I intend to follow the eternal flame of my secrecy
Emancipate the mortal world as minds redeem from the mortuary
The only life in the darkness
Is the force that yearns
In my soul

The black funeral uniform
Gives me powers
I'm catching without warning
The dark paranormal calling
A putrefied shadow that
In purgatory dwell
Imprisoned by the cold anxious pits of hell

A serpent in my soul

In midnight's aura as
A ghostly fire
The child prodigy
Of abysmal desire
As the deathlike silence pervades
The incubus now invades
Show yourself unclean spirit
Tonight I give thy shadow life
Rise with me in darkest blessing
Thine demon force
I feel possessing
A holotropic mind and spectral eyes divine
Through the  shallow haze
As sky turns red
