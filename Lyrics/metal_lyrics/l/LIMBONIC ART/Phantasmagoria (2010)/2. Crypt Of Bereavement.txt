Moonlight shadows drifting across the menacing sky
Plague-ridden with dark secrets of the night
An awakening of ill-omened life
A shudder of horrified fear will haunt your dreams
The witching hour draws near, dismalsomber screams
A kiss of death in the full moon light, phantom souls will walk the land
Ghouls of rotten misanthropic flesh, as the ominous darkness descend
This is where the damned corpses rest, trapped in aghast-purgatory
An incubation place for evil
Buried and forgotten on unholy ground
Their sins of evil are still roaming around
Sepulchral screams from the stony chambers, undead creatures of doom
Spirits that never really left the mortal soil, because they died too soon
They are still returning, they will never find peace
In search for the life they lost so tragically
Full of anger, driven by hate
The pain that they suffer has turned into rage
