From birth to death, we travel between eternities
Misplaced in a world, on the verge of adversity
Into a sequence of violence and madness
An encounter with our destiny
The end of time is here
Only the dead have seen the end of war
On a virtual highway of death
We are reborn, to the path of thorns
Everyday is a step closer
To the eternal darkened adventure
Let the eagle soar and the thunders roar
Scenery in turmoil, wastelands of war
Everyday is a step closer
To the eternal darkened adventure
Monuments of lies, blinding faithful eyes
A world in pandemonium
Contaminated streams of evil poison
Vaporizes from the sour ground
Sulfuric acid gasses fill the atmosphere
A world in pandemonium, the end of time is here
