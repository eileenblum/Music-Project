As we expire from the face of earth and leave the flesh behind to decay
Will there be a delight rebirth or will darkness lead the soul astray
In the moment that you die, your whole life is passing by
Only then you will see how your afterlife will be
Catch a glimpse of the death light, on the journey towards the other side
As you drift through eternal haze, dismal domain of the space
An arrival into a void so dark and so cold, a realm of nothingness
In utter darkness you are damned, seduced by a kiss of death
Incarcerated in a deep consciousness where time has ceased
Lifeless dreaming in an infinite gloomy display, a black sphere of serenity
Entering the darkest lair, an empty frozen atmosphere of demise
Isolation in desolation, obscure spectral dimension beyond the mind's eye
Journey into death's euphoria
Beyond the great dark adventure
A world unseed so mysterious supreme
Timeless and ageless, no end no beginning
Soundless utter emptiness, dormant suffering
Death's icy grip holds all life in its grasp
There is nothing there except your fear
