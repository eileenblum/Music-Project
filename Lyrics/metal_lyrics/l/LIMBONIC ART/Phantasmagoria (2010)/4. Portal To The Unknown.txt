As the shadows fall, a paranormal call
Ambiance of the enchanted night
Embracing with thrilling delight
Winds of darkness is stealing my soul
I am facing forward into the abyss
Descending into a deep black hole
Exhuming the darkness below and above
My soul drifts with the undead spirits
Into the most extreme region of the human mind
There is a dark cold place where men meet them self
Death is my sanctuary, a violent flow of energy
I hear the mysterious echoes of the past
Cascading forces, figments of imagination
Sculptures carved in stone, the portal to the unknown
