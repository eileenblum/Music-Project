A star gate to illusions and dreams, ascend the eye of infinity
Parallel dimensions unseen, a spiral galaxy
Seeing through the eyes of the dead, explore the sacred codex
Hypnotized by the circling sky, the burning vortex
Entranced the soul goes beyond, to a world without end
Labyrinth of the mind, astral projection
At the edge of eternity, spiritual evolution
A transcendental journey is about to begin
Crossing boundaries of dazzling light
I levitate through a tempest of demise
In the dark enigma of esoteric dreams, bonding mortal flesh in divine ecstasy
I am captured by a revolving blaze, devoured deep into the cosmic haze
On the threshold to abstract bliss
I leap from my inner sanctum, to interstellar abyss
Seeing through the eyes of the dead, explore the sacred codex
Hypnotized by the circling sky, the burning vortex
Beyond the shadows I fall into a loop of flashing lights
Alignment of stars illuminates the blackened sky
Unveiling the passage to arcane creation and sights
