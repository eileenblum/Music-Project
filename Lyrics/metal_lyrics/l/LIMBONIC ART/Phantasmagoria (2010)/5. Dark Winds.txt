In the grip of winter cold, as nature freezes my soul
The abyss consume my mind, only darkness I can find
A ghastly whisper in the night, lead me astray from the light
As waves rises from the stormy sea, I feel an ancient force possesses me
A ghastly whisper in the night, lead me astray from the light
Trapped in a phantasmal dream, where faces of dead is haunting
Visions that tortures my mind, as dark winds embracing
Dark winds embrace me
