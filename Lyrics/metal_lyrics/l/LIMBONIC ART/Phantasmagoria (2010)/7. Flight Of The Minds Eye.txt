I gaze at the stars in the deep cosmic sea
Excursion beyond vast unknown mysteries
Across the millennial ocean in unearthly streams
Enthralled by the bliss of astral energies
In a magic trance I dwell
My eyes are ablaze with the fires of hell
I transcend to another certainty
A remote realm of mythology
In a sequence of epic dreaming, I find myself in a celestial dome
Psychic forces surrounding as the spirit penetrate the nebulous zone
I gaze at the stars in the deep cosmic sea
Excursion beyond vast unknown mysteries
Across the millennial ocean in unearthly streams
Enthralled by the bliss of astral energies
In a magic trance I dwell
My eyes are ablaze with the fires of hell
I transcend to another certainty
A remote realm of mythology
In an aura of mysticism, dreamscapes will unfold
Cloaked in a web of secrecy, a universe ageless and cold
