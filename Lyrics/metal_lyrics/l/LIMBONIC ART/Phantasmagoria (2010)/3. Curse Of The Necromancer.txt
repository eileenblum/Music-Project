Blessed underneath the blood red moon
Calling forth the dormant souls of doom
Mysterious rite of the underworld, codex of hell, energies swirl
Black magic has spawned tonight, commanding the dead to rise
Mysterious rite of the underworld, codex of hell, energies swirl
As the sky fades to black, unholy demons will attack
Awakened from the cryptic dark side
Invocation underneath the blood red moon
Arising from the shallow tomb
Mysterious rite of the underworld, codex of hell, energies swirl
Resurrect the evil spirits of the undead tormentors
Mysterious rite of the underworld, codex of hell, energies swirl
As the sky fades to black, unholy demons will attack
Awakened from the cryptic dark side, curse of the necromancer
Sacrificial ceremony, enter now the mortal world
Unclean spirit, thy dark energies swirl
Another return to the grave land, inside stony walls
Of the mausoleum, a temple of decay
Sepulchral echoes chasing through the enchanted night
