Join in for a dance with the dead
A ceremonial requiem for the gods
When the moon is drained by all its light
On burial ground we gather in the night

Burning candles, incantations
Witches sabbath with unholy craft
Screams and laughter pierce the art
Like a haunting chant through the atmosphere

The dance is held to the end
When the shades of darkness transcend
Beside the ancient lake beneath the spelling moon
Across the fields of hallowed tombs

Join us, walk among us
Mysticus Magus Manifesto Spectaculum Mortuus Exercilor

We are they who adore the vast midnight skies
Where stars they shines like serpent eyes
We'll free thy soul from its chain
Arrive with thunderstorms and rain
From the darkest abyss graveland unfolds
Oh hear the distant echoes call
The eve of midnight a host supreme
Open thy world unseen

Eve of midnight

He who holds the book of sights
Shall be the ruler of the night
