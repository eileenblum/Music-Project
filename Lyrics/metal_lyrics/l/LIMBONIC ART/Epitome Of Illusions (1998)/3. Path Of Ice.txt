Journey into your darkened secrets
Feel the burning flame inside
Admit the ecstacy of the extreme
Just close the eyes and enjoy the override
When we adrift through the sensual streams
The enchanted pains are so divine

There are thorns everywhere
But along the path of ice rose blooms above
Blood is the rose of mysterious unions
The symbol of potency
A taste of erotic sins of lust
The entrance of immortality

There are such sights to see
Adventures and pleasures to feel
The dormant seeds of suffering
The art of mortal flesh that bleed
Indulged in desire, the forbidden soul empire

Path of ice
The entrance to immortality

Cold winds pierce through me
As my darkstar unfolds
I ascend the throne of fantasies
Where the beautiful abyss recalls
