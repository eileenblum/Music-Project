I require the solace of the shadows
So the night can be redeemed
As the winds of darkness whispers my name
A kiss of death I receive
Nocturnal enchanter to thy art I yield
Within the candlelight a rapture is sealed

I set the stones for invoking ceremonies
In the twilight zones arise abstract galaxies
The magic eye unveils the blackened skies
A new horizon begins to each one that dies

The desolation makes me feel
So dark, so cold, the silence
So dark, so cold, the emptiness
Solace of the shadows

Night surrounds and embraces me
Darkness holds the secrets of man's fears
It captures my heart as the purgatory sears
I cast now the spell as I cross through raging flames
Into darkness cursing names

I require the solace of the shadows
So the night can be redeemed

Nocturnal enchanter to thy art I yield
Within the candlelight a rapture is now revealed
