This is the genesis of a traumatic voyage
As you fall into a deep sleep
Beyond the point of no return

Once you have looked into the abysmal darkness
You carry it with you as a legacy for the rest of your life
The sky is a lonely place, an endless consuming space
Embrace the silent waves of cosmos
As the astral ocean rise in high tide

A magic flame inside of me
Burns with lust and desire
I watch the dying sun
As it fades into the horizon of crimson fire
The paranormal darkness is now descending
Invasion of my mind, heart and soul
As reality shatters around me
I feel the changing the metamorphosis

The night belongs to the predator
To the one who dares crossing the threshold
The axis of dreams and wonders and black miracles
I see my self in the mirror of your eyes
A dark star on the celestial beautiful midnight sky
Release the inner radiance of what you have become
Brighten the night with your sacrifice

I have returned to life to speak of clairvoyance
I am the voice from the grave land of memories
Life can be only an illusion and death a temptation
A final destiny

A cosmic funeral of memories
