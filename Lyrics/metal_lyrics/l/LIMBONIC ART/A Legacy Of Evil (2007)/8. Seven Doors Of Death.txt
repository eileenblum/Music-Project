Woe be unto him who ventures near
Without knowledge
Ultra violent scenarios
Anguish crying
Images from the beyond
Nightmares never dying

Within the realm of desperation
Seeking lexis of illumination
Psychological terror, permanent psychosis
A sculpture in the land of decay
Woe be unto him who opens
The seven dreaded gateways

Asylum of neurotic minds
Devour all consciousness
Insanity is there to find
Dominion of darkness

Restless days and sleepless nights
Drawn in the direction of the moon
Infernal magnet to mysterious destiny
Beyond the grave of doom

Walk and dream amongst the dead
Anger and pain resurrected
Necropolis manifestation
Supernatural obsession
Phantasmagorical state of mind
Trapped in another dimension of time
In a paradise lost
Endless horizon of wilderness and holocaust
