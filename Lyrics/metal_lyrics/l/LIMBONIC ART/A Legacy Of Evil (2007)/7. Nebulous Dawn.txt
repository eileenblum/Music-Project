Dark atmospheric winds
Are striking towards earth
Nihilistic cosmic force
Asteroid curse

A blazing phenomenon
Launching through the skies
A deadly impact, tempest chaos
Utterly devoid of life
Fountains of fire rise from the lava chambers
Columns of smoke darken the sky
And covers the landscape in ashes
Storms with the anatomy of disaster
Immense swirling winds

A titanic explosion
Echoes over the earth
Apocalyptic spawn
Nebulous dawn
Fountains of fire rise from the lava chambers
Columns of smoke darken the sky
And covers the landscape in ashes
Storms with the anatomy of disaster
Immense swirling winds

An epic eclipse of the sun
A rebirth of desolation
When the cold silence reigns
Darkness sweeps the face of earth
With infesting freezing torments
Across the desert wastelands
Cataclysmic events
