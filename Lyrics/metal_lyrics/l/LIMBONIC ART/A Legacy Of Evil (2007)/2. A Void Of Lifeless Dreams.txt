I close my eyes and transcend
Beyond the light to a dark world without end
The spirit escapes the temple of flesh
As seductive winds of madness
Absorbing me in to the cryogenic system

A void of lifeless dreams

Enter a galactic domain
Frozen in time and space
A new infinity of serenity
Interstellar voyage
The spirit escapes the temple of flesh
Into the sphere of mystified gloom
A cosmic funeral of memories

A void of lifeless dreams

Sarcophagus panorama

A mania to explore the enigma
Isolated celestial corpse
Astral embryonic life form
Invocation of the dormant realms

A void of lifeless dreams
