A grim darkened spirit
In a world of woe
Imprisoned evil beauty
From the cold depths below
Linger in perpetual dream state
In the grip of a powerful rage

Summon the oblivion
Hear demons call from the dungeon
Light has forever abandoned this land
Life has forsaken this souls
Reaching out from the cold
A dark and hellish void
Beyond the entrance of imagination

Infernal phantom kingdom

After years of dormancy
In a cosmic mausoleum
Arcane cemetery
The soil is cursed and sour
A rotten landscape draped in horror
Evil has a way of returning
You can not hide from hell's eye
It is always burning
A way of returning
