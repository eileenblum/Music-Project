The night has a legacy of evil
Nocturnal dream scapes
Wilderness of infinite disharmony
In an isolated aspect eternally
A maze inside your brain
That leads into the insane
Abyss of fear, illusions and despair

Something ghastly is passing by
The full moon in the sky
See the coming hurricane of terror
Ancient sadness and horror
A virulent syndrome of misanthropy
Captured by the obscure mystery

Is it really freedom?
Outside these black walls of hatred
