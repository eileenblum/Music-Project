Underneath the ice of winter
There is a stream so powerful
A dark river that will swallow your soul

As it twist into form
You dwell in a cold dark void
Frozen and lifeless dreaming
Deep down in the darkness screaming

When pain comes to power
All the sorrows of the heart
Leading your soul astray
To a realm of agony

As it twist into form
You dwell in a cold dark void
Frozen and lifeless dreaming
Deep down in the darkness screaming
All you have left is death's desire for you

A black hole
Well of souls
Icy breath
Stone cold death
Darkness calls
As heaven falls to earth
