Gloria Sathanas

The undivinew deceptor
Enemy of all holiness
The eminent destructor
Brings life into misery and death

The magic sights of thy third eye
Triumphant wargod rising tall
Sparkling rain falls from the sky
When thunder`s blasying heavens wall

Gloria Sathanas

From four pains in the horizon
A circle`s drawn in fire
By sword I kneel in union
Within my burning empire

A mind sincerity
And obedience to the sources of its nature
A heart in crulety
Reaches out for evil in the obscure

To be crowned as a legion of darkness
I`m weaving a spell of black energy
In aspects of might to obliterate
Breeding the wrath into plain hate

In apocalyptic rage
I curse time and age
Humans bleed for me
Coronation of dark victory

Gloria Sathanas
