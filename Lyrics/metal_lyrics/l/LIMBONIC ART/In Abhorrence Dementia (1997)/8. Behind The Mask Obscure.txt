[Overture]

In distance from the light I redeem my gloria
In darkness I have sights a high esteemed fantasia

In hellfire and damnation my undead soul walk the land
Throught the endless mist of time
I`m born ro darkened adventures retlaiated in lifes obscure

To seek vengance for my pains
To serve the hatred in my veins
In centuries I have wandered
With deaths shadows drifting faithfully
In the darkest forests in mans domain
I rceived my strenght and sorcery
My demon search for a doorway to be free
For once again to desecrate the hearts serenity
Transcend mortality live throught eternally
And feast upon all misery
that is gathered here in life

In hellfire and damnation
my undead soul walk the land
Throught the endless mist of time
i`m born to darkened adventures
retailed in life obscure

Seasons they rise and fall
I have seen throught them all
With harsh evil prophecies
I gave birth to inhumanity
