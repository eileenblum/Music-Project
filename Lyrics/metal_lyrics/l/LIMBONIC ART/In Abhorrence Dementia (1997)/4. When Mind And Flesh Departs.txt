I`m captured by the sound of the tempest
winds And my demonvoice that dwells within
The ground I walk is sour
A spectrum shines so genuine
While the earthquake starts to devour
I behold the shrine in the ruin

I pledge allegiance
To the night with all its mysteries
Reign I forever in darkness
The events of light is killing me only

On sad wings of destiny
A fallen angels sanctuary
Love is here like disease
Draped in vain the heart yearns to cease

The human way of life, an inferior state of
mind
The third stone from the sun
Had become a stillborn illusion

I`m under siege of anger and fury
There is no values no faith or glory
Antagonising mortal flesh
Life on Earth I do oppress
With infernal bleedings of bitterness

I have seen in my darkest dream
Throught the astral gate in a vortex fate
Death coldening the warrior`s fire

Floating energy of passion
Captures life-force comprehension
On third burial ground of mankind

I have seen in my darkest dream
Throught the astral gate in a vortex fate
Death coldening the warrior`s fire

When mind and flesh depart

A cryptic message comes from the heart
As I see and experience the bleeding art
The pain is only to avoid
Cause the spirit enters a greater void

I have seen in my darkest dream
Throught the astral gate in a vortex fate
Death coldening the warrior`s fire

I cleanse within ascending steams
Arising shadow, the dark soul relase
All it`s power
When mind and flesh depart
