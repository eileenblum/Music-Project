I admire the spiritual force of evil
A pure supreme instinction in survival
Never underestimate the powers of hatred
When the blackness overwhelming

With a hostile image against all living
The splendid visions of malignant breeding

The dominions on Earth shall return to the beast
As the darkside awaits the capture and feast
With dark surrounding illusions

Possesion in passion, simplicity is intuitive
Native forces of violent misery

The soil in a man`s heart is stonier
In stench of rot and sour ground
The obedient fall into cruelty
Where all arts of life shall be undone

A madness wells up in me
As I swallow the pain
Where unbounded evil reign
In Abhorrence Dementia
