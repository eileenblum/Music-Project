[Overture]

A veil of darkness rest upon my shoulder
I reign and serve and obedient beholder
Cause the shadows are my hearts domain
and where I wander

I have returned to the land of decase
To walk the stony trial across the spectral fields
And in wildrness of haunting pains
Is where I slumber

From the highest mountaim winds uplift me high
Into the magic fountain the force within the light
I covet every vision when I`m allowed to die
Leave this earthly mission
and enter fullmoon eye
A true believer that death deliver
A life deceiver in misanthrophy
When life is the cross I have to bear
A phantom soul is calling
Enclosed within stone prison walls

Deep in the heart of despair
Sentenced to walk among the living
In the face of the enemy
As I drown in tormenting oppression

Like a lonely candle burning
I blaze as the darkness emerging
And I yield for the art to bleed

When the moon is drained by all its light
And the stars they shine like serpent eyes
I`m feeling deaths desire for me

Baptised in esteem or arrogance
Raping all virtue and sweet romance
Bewitched by sins and lust

Emancipate the deceiving earth
Praise the sign in the sky for no new rebirth
Under burdens of life`s holocaust
