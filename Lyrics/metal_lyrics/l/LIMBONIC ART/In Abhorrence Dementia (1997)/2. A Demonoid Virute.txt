Higher, higher burning fire
Unite with me in dark desire
Inflaming greed awakens to breed in me

The night has predatoral eyes
Drifting in a plae of disguise
Beneath the spelling moon
The spirit rises out of darkness
The spirit rises...

Voices call for my soul

The cunning serpents kiss I taste
Baptised beside the ancient takes of

FIRE, FIRE burning higher
Unite with me in dark desires
I perish in bliss of cruelty
Tormented souls will never...rest in peace

In the flames an omen blaze
Enforcing throught the cosmic haze
To cross the line and dare to glance
And enter cold void where death romances
In mysteries

In the flames an omen blaze
Enforcing throught the cosmic haze
To cross the line and dare to glance
And enter the cold void where death romances
In mysteries

O` raging fire enlighten me with sin
