Six months isn't very long to find yourself in this scene
We are blinded by uncertainty
Image means everything, not what you hold true
The distance between us is miles You don't know what this means
You don't know what is real
You don't know what I think
You don't know what I feel
Because we are not the same
Don't stand in front of me with your arms raised high
I've seen the flags you once waved
The ones you'll soon deny
I've watched you come, and I'll watch you pass
We're the first ones in this fight and we will be the last
You seem to go in whatever direction the wind will take you
But I will remain steadfast throughout the storm
Although we each face separate trials
No matter how close we are
The distance between us is miles.
