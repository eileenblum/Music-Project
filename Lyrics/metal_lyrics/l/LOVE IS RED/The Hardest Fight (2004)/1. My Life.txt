I'm plagued by what I'm supposed to be
Your life, your goals
That's not what's best for me
You've shown me your dreams of who I am
Well this is my life
In the palm of my hand
I'll take advantadge
Day by day
Embrace tomorrow
Forget yesterday
These second chances make things right
I've been knocked down but I won't die without a fight.
