Everytime I fall away, part of you pulls me back in 
I try to run, but your love embraces my pain
I'm never willing to give enough
I'm never willing to cherish the things I have
I always make selfish mistakes, and fall flat on my back
Say Goodbye to the life that you once led
Say Goodbye to the memories in your head
From this day on, life will never be the same
I start today to change my fate
I can feel you, all around me, pulling me closer to you
these last few months, have been so hard, but my faith has struggled through
I want you to die, your words have ruined so much of my faith
every empty promise you have ever made has come back to kill another life inside of me
please just die so I can be set free
I never wanted any of this
Say Goodbye.
