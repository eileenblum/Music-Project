Where are you now?
The choices that you made
The prices that you've paid
Was it all worth it in the end?
When all is said and all is done
Where will you run to now?
The glory days are over
Your words are hollow
The vision you once had disappeared
So follow along to the path you have chosen for yourself
No one will listen to you now
Your time has run out
Everything I ever wanted you to know
I can just sit back and tell you now
Over the years we were so close, but you are dead to me now
You are dead to me
Over the years your time has run out
Over the years you've become dead to me
Everything I ever wanted you to know
I can just sit back and tell you now
The words sat at the tip of my tongue for all this time
I've never had the strength to push them out
Now the day has come where I won't be afraid
Because I've been that way for far too long.
