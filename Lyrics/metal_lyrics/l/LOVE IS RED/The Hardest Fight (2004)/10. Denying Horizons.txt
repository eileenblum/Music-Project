Searching for a better way as we move on
The enduring pain of yesterday
The cold fear in your eyes
What will become of me as time goes by?
The harm and the hurt I've felt, I cannot deny
But a flame still remains
And it burns in my heart
I will not sit back and watch as time tears me apart
Take back today
Fight for tomorrow
