Knowing what you once were
And seeing what you've become
As far as I'm concerned, your days are done
Stop making excuses to justify your actions
Accept your mistakes
Rather than hiding from it all
I hate the fact you've changed
I hate you gave it up
I hate the fact that you've turned to everyting you're not
Searching for acceptance
Whatever it takes
Selling everyone out
Your life's a fake
I hate everything you love.
