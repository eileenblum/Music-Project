I still feel the same and that's okay
I am not ashamed of loving you
If you don't love me anymore, I can move on
But I'll hold a place for you in my heart
I'll hold a place for you in my heart

Because I'm so happy to be alive
But I know sunsets will never look the same
And moonlight reflecting the oceans waves 
Won't affect me the same way
Now that you're gone
But I'll have a fresh view without you
I'm just grateful to have had the chance to be with you
I'm just grateful to have had the chance to be with you

I feel my life is too short to waste on self-pity
I tried my best with you and I'm sorry it wasn't enough
But I tried and I know that's a step for me

I have so much growing to do and the future scares me too

I have so much growing to do and the future scares me too
But I have faith and trust to remain optimistic
So take my hand and let's run into this beautiful unknown
