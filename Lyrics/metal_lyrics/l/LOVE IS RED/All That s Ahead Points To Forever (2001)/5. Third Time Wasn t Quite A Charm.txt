This time I'll pick myself up
I'll smile and dust myself off
You've always been so important to me
But I've been knocked down too many times

It's time to move on and start my own
But I don't want to be with anyone else
If you don't want me, I'll be on my own
It will be hard, but I know I can make it

It's so hard to see you out there
When I can't be the one to hold your hand
But it brings a smile to my face
When I think of the times we had together
I love you, I miss you, I wish you all the best
I love you, I miss you, I wish you all the best

Please don't forget my face
I will never forget you
