When I think of you, I think of things
We did together (together)
We used to hold each other's hand (together)
Running through cold clouds (together)
Feeling the sun on our faces (together)
Now you're gone...

You painted your picture on my heart
And all I need is to hold your hand again
But until you come back I'll smile and keep my faith
I can see this time

These golden clouds rush in
And I feel I can rest in the peace
I found here without you
My mind is at ease when we are close
But I know it's not time
I'm reaching for you my dear
I'm waiting with open arms
