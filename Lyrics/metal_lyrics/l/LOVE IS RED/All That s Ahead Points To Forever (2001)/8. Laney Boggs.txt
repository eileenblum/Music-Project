My eyes can't connect with your's
Your eyes and smile paralyze me
My hands can't touch your face
Every expression on your face melts my heart
I'd do anything to kiss your lips
And wrap my arms around you
I'd do anything to kiss your lips
And wrap my arms around you

Everything about you makes my heart stop
The way your hair falls; the way your lips move

No one else would see everything that's happened
It keeps us running backwards
But I'd love to hold your hand every time you hurt
And we could move ahead

Everything about you makes my heart stop
The way your eyes gleam; the way your cheeks move

I know I'll never hold your hand
Or trace my fingers across your cheeks
But I know I could live from here on
In the hope your eyes give to me
