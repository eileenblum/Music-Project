I felt your cheek under my fingertips
Those tears mean nothing anymore
For all the pain I've been handed
And all the tears I have wasted
I fell in love with you
You wouldn't stop to see
I fell in love with you
You wouldn't stop to see
I wish I never felt you next to me
Then I wouldn't feel so alone

I walk through every day of my life scared to see you
I never know what to say
Why am I in love with you

You'd never appreciate
I gave you all of my heart
When we were together
You wouldn't stop to see
Your plans would never include me
So why did I sacrifice myself
For you
