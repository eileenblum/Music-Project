You might think that I don't listen
But I promise I've heard every word
Why do you leave me so confused
I feel so up and down with you
With you

I don't understand what's so wrong
I'm trying so hard to make things better
It would be so much easier to hold you close to me
And feel you breathing
Feel you breathe next to me

I know these times are strange
And I know you don't feel the same
But I know that I have changed
Now I know that I have the strength
To treat you better
Now there's no turning back
And all that's ahead points to forever
