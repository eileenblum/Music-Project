Can I hold this moment
Because I'm so scared of what the future holds
Trusting seems to be the hardest thing to do
I pray my feelings won't run away with this 
When we see each other again
Will you trust it this time
Will you trust me this time

So I wait for this to complete
And I'll try to have faith that you are coming back to me

Hold my hand; we don't have to talk
If you want to leave, please just kiss my cheek
Because the air tonight is lovely 
And I won't forget your face in the moonlight

Will you think of me or am I burden in your life
Can you look into these eyes and see the pain I feel inside
I am so weak in this state
Nothing I do gives me the strength
My hands are reaching for the sky; the beauty that comes from above
Will blanket and comfort me
