So will this be the last time
Or will you come and break my heart again
Every time you feel the need I'm always there for you
And when you've had enough, you go you're own way
Have you ever stopped to think about the way I feel
Why won't you open your eyes
Look what's happened to us
I'm never right, you're never wrong
All I am is a burden to you

I've written so many different words to you
But they all say the same thing
I want to let go of your memory
But I remember every time you (hurt me)

I tried to blow off every hurtful word
I wonder if you even have a heart
And I gave you the best of me
But you wouldn't let me near your heart

I gave you the best of me

I've written so many different words to you
But they all say the same thing
I want to let go of your memory
But I remember every time you hurt me
