The steam shall give birth to a glacier
The heath shall give way to sand
Bone shall become tusk
Hair shall become nail
Tooth shall cling to skull

Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire

Asphault shall flow like water
Forest shall crowd out the worms

Nothing ever began
There was no dawn
The heat chars
The cold stabs

The wheat shall give way to chaff
Bone shall crack against bone

Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire
