O sail of skin tumbling in the air
Blowing anywhere

O absent law
Chattering useless teeth
Secreting quiet sweat

Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium

O mirror that does not reflect

O fire that illuminates nothing
But itself

O shadow of what never was
But seems to have been
And to have been lost

Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium
