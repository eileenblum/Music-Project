A cascade of lightning startles the firmament
A thousand black hooves clatter
Upon the mountain

Grey plume of dust
Red flag of blood
Blue shining blade of sky

Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword

Fresh skulls and supple bones
Golden helm of radiance

The incantation uttered by no one
The call to arms from nowhere

The message from the clarion
Resounded across deaf hills
Men awoke
And sprayed their blood upon the earth

Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword
Unseeing eye
Blood mixed with blood
