In vain the iron-wrought tower
Pierces heaven's dome
In vain the muscle tears it's fiber
Ten more fibers blossom in its place

They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void

In vain the moat surrounds the castle
Mud skulks across its bed
In vain contraction
In vain expansion

In vain our kinds seeks total order
There is a fissure at the heart of being

They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void
