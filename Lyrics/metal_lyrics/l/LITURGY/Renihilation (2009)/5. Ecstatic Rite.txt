And the yoke weighed heavily
Upon the neck
And the tractors placed their tracks
Upon the cowering soil

The arrow cast
The bow pulled back
The arrow cast

And the chains were linked to other chains
Forged obliquely, freeing no one and everyone

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

From river to sea
The waves sing and shine
Untrained, unrestrained
Desiring nothing
From hill to vale
Form gives way to form
