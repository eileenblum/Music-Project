I force through the opening
I claw through veil after veil

Absent purity
Painted dawn

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation

I choke the apocalyptic trumpet
With my power
Resounding though the arcangel
Like marrow

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation

Absent purity
Painted dawn
The future is nowhere
The past is gone

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
