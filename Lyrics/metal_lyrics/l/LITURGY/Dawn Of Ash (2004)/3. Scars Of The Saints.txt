The gnostic texts, ancient, depending on
canonical gospels. Questionable are these
works for they too were written by man from
the alternative voice of Christ. Orthodox
and heresy depict a world of mysteries soon
to be destroyed by the hierarchical church.

Preceding the heretics, a revelation! A history
has been written. Documents of Christian
antiquity. A revelation! Scars of the saints.

The scholars flounder in ignorant darkness
and bygone are the decades of truth relying
on a vision of control that will flourish
through a world of the misleading. Look
into the eyes of the saints and see their
scars for those who have witnessed. A
miracle dawn is coming, the cynics say.
Come forward now. If I hadn't believed it
I wouldn't have seen it.

Preceding the heretics, a revelation! A history
has been written. Documents of Christian
antiquity. A revelation! Scars of the saints.
