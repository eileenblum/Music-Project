Exact bleeding lacerations mirroring the sacred wounds of christ. 
A blessing of the devout 
penetrating through the wrists and feet
Back lashings bleed as the blood odor reeks of flowers 
A crown of thorns and a spear in the side
A rapture of roman torture
Wounds of christ carried by the saints
Wounds of christ 
Twelve divine apostles
Only the most noble followers are blessed with this pain
A gift from god posses those and fill them with rage
Exact bleeding lacerations mirroring the sacred wounds of christ. 
A blessing of the devout 
penetrating through the wrists and feet
Back lashings bleed as the blood odor reeks of flowers 
A crown of thorns and a spear in the side
A rapture of roman torture
The exstacy of the limbs covered wounds
Remedies will not cure 
Power of alleged miracles the profound want and confound the doubters
Repeat verse one and three
Repeat chorus
