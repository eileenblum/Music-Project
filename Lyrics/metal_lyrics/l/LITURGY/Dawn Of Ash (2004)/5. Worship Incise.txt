Fingers cross one another. Kneeling and
speaking words of belief. The dawn has come
and gone. Do not misunderstand the word. This
kingdom is built on faith; seeing, not believing.

Therefore I will shake the heavens and the
earth shall remove out of her place, in the
wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of
his fierce anger.

A false gospel, a false salvation will rise. Forgive
or be stoned to death. Do not speak of this
kingdom, as the dragon will arise from the sea
seeking only revenge.
