[Brodequin Cover]

Hidden within pulsating under the skin shift and turn rotten body infested with worms. 

Victims of a roadside murder buried where they fell no one near to hear the screams no one left to tell, a shallow grave marks the spot where parts of the dead find rest stabbed in the throat tongue cut out slowly bled to death, 

Quietly tucked deep inside devouring bodies any size.
