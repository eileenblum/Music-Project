By divine order: rejection! This first coming
of the gospel. Ascending the mountain once
more. Forty days with no food or water. The
commandments are born.

As the bishops gather, the children of of
Belial are gone out from among you to
serve other gods which we have not known.

The divine have come here to make order
our of chaos and chaos out of control.
Fear not these men who have chosen a
false doctinre spoken by many tongues.
