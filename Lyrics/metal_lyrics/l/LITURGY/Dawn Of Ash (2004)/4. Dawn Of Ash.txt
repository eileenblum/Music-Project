Dreams' reflections are interpretations of
this world. "Split a piece of wood and I am there.
Life a stone and you will find me." I will never
rest until I am found. 

The closer you come, tempation grows stronger.
You must find atonement for the demons. They 
will come and feed on the weak. I am all around 
you. I live inside you.

We are the enemy. Excommuned messengers
will come. The spirit alive as people put to death
in the name of god. 

I confess. The guilt overwhelms.
Show me his wounds. I must see them to believe, 
for hope has finally died.
