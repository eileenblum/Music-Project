The hero's statue drips with stones
Parched dried up like his bones

The tragic laurel goes
To the temples
As their doors come to a close

The lava blows
Vesuvius Blushes
Underneath his clothes

The tragic laurel goes
With the torso
Locked in contrappasto pose

The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes
