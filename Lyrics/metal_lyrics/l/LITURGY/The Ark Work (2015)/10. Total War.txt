severed ties
whitened eyes
cradled head

skeletons intertwined
soldered wives
source of life
golden thread

droning crowd
furrowed brow
wage a total war
pull your purple heart

amulet
fragile stem
from a girl

madrigal
of the sun
parted lips
foreign tongue
GPS

severed ties
whitened eyes
wage a total war
pull your purple heart

queue of clueless cries
dumb relentless drive

queue of clueless cries
dumb relentless drive
