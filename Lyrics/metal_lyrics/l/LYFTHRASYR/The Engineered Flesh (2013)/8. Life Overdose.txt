Years flashed by
I was distraught
But now as they are endless
Lethargic my award

Enhanced for life
not as a whole
My lack of acceptation
is now advanced debility

To be immortal beyond the price
of precious motivity
Adverse reaction undesigned
This is my fate eternally

But I will not accept this fate
I will not accept it
I will live
I will move

Years flashed by
I am forlorn
The water still is running
Whence-ever it may come

My mind is clear
The flesh dateless
But something has gone wrong
Now I have to find a way to

Get a life - I can't
Get a life - I want
Get a life - I try
Get a life - I will

I was immortalized
Despite of risk denaturalized
By an injection made to ban
All god like forces harming man
But not all cell types did respond
My mind is working body not
Infested with vigil coma
With gout-like torpor evermore

But I'm sure that mind can control
The matter itself to make me arise
I can move
I will move
I will live

Years flashed by
I was distraught
But now as they are endless
Lethargic my reward

Impaired for life
Not as a whole
Clear mind but gone motivity
My price for immortality
