Knowledge is flowing with the connection to the embedding machine
And wisdom is growing through cables ensuring the information stream
No study is needed to make the step to highly updated esteem
Just money is needed to justify what one might call the human dream

Knowledge is chosen from drop-down menues offering infinite content
And wisdom is frozen to user's mind providing limitless extent
No effort is needed to upgrade eighty percent of brain capacity
Just money and insight are useful to finally reach veracity

The human brain capacity is limited no more
By credit card or debit barred to them who can afford
Embedded knowledge outperforms the regular effort
So wisdom lost its luster to the knowledge update in the store

Knowledge is flowing with the connection to the embedding machine
And wisdom is growing through cables ensuring the information stream
No interest is needed to study and working hard is no necessity
Just money and foresight are useful to finally reach voracity
