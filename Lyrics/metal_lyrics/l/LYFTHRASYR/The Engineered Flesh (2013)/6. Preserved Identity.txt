The memory encoding brain structures will persist
Some period of time after clinical death comes
This is my way to gather endless life!
The memory encoding brain structures will survive
The process conducting cryopreservation
And future science will trace my aim to bring back my mind!

Long time cryopreservation can be achieved by cooling
to 77.15 kelvin, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.
It is a common mistaken belief that cells will lyse
due to the formation of ice crystals within the cell,
but this only occurs if the freezing rate exceeds
the osmotic loss of water to the extracellular space.

Revival is reached by reversing the causes
of death and the adverse effects of your freezing
but what if this will be impossible?
Mind transfer could be an alternative way scanning
memory contents of your preserved brain cells
but memory might not contain my identity!

I'm afraid of what will be...
Death, freezing, revival...
And what about my identity...
No evidence at all...
Will I still be myself?
Or just a piece of mind?
But in whom should I trust?
The opium or the cognitive god?

The memory encoding brain structures will persist
Some period of time after clinical death comes
Is this my way to gather endless life?
The memory encoding brain structures will survive
The process conducting cryopreservation
But memory may not preserve my ID | entity!
