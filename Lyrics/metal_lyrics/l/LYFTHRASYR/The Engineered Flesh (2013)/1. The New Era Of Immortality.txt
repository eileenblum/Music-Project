We must confess to reach eternal presence
In afterlife by caprice of a higher nature
No way to know about succeeding promise
Only blind trust and desperate diurnal piety

Destroy the god machine's futility
The new era of immortality

The lack of life to face acceleration
Will now be void achieved divinely stimulated
Time is the Key in arbitrary size canned
No foolish fate and no temporal morass anymore

We must confess - No!
We must repress - No!
We must regress - No!
We have to - we are god!

Obtain the god machine's ability
The new era of immortality

We will progress to give eternal presence
In current life by increase of human transnature
Now we know about succeeding promise
Just trust ourselves to gain engineered immortality

Exploit the god machine's debility
Destroy the god machine's futility
Obtain the god machine's ability
The new era of immortality
