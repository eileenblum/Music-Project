Technology is rising up
exponentially against all our assumptions
Accelerate the science-based
progress of machine intelligence instantly

But once we reach the practical
usability of GNR* deployment
We modify genetical
structure of ourselves improving autonomously

Intelligence - the only edge of mankind
We learned to fly and how to transmute elements
But finitude reveals our limitations
until the singularity
The human age now reached its final chapter
and strong AI runs throughout our veins eternally
Digital youth beyond all limitations
straight towards immortality

Tearing apart from old complaints
Nanobots will support our immune system
heightening our intelligence
Strong AI will rise installing post-humanity
