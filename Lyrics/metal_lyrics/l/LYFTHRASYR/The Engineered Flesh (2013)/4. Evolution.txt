Evolute, evolute, evolute, evolute

From man to machine
Desegregate between
With progress unfolding
Acceptancy within

For a better nation
In anticipation
Of sophistication
And eternal sanity

Evolute, evolute, evolute, evolute
Evolute, evolute, evolute, evolute

Humans are afraid
Of progress' upper grade
Surveillance is the fiend
And foolish people teamed

Genetic algorithms
Stand-alone decisions
Rising populations
Evoluting randomly

Evolute, evolute, evolute, evolute

[Spoken:]
Why should we rebel against the system
Where evil is extinguished successfully by high-performance
Surveillance technologies
All problems are solved evolutionary
Hence, there will always be an evolutionary way
To prevent misusage of such techniques
Progress should never be impeded
As its benefits will help the people by far more than it makes them suffer
We should be proud of being part of it

From machine to man
By one personal scan
The integrated plan
Forevermore we can

For a better nation
In anticipation
Of sophistication
And eternal sanity

Evolute, evolute, evolute, evolute
