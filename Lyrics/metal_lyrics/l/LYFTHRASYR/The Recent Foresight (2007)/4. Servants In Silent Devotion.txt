Sighing on behalf of those who cherish duress
To keep addiction and conviction to the raptures of my mind
Hybrid illusions carve desires to obsess

Am I destined for a bereavement left to share me astound
Like vivid dreams of distressed insanity's embrace
The taste of guiltless deep temptation spreads around

Servants of profanity to court
In passion shattered order the fortune to destine
Silent abolition to despair
Devotion for endeavor presumed to live in vanity

Mysteries revealed for total dedication
Unties volition to ignition in a carnage of disgrace
Regress exceeds all expectations in motion

In vicious rumors dies attendance on a tying decay
The flesh is willing and the salacious spirit weak
A brave decision for a vying disarray

Wealth required by nature is limited and easy to procure
But wealth required by vain ideals extends to infinity
Devote yourself to veins preserved in suspicion to obscure

Silent abolition to despair my living sin
In passion shattered order the fortune to destine
Servants of profanity to court my vanity
Devotion for endeavor presumed to live in sanity
