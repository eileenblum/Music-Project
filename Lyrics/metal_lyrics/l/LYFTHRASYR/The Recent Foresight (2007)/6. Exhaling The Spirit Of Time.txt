Fighting for cognition in a mutual disease...

Illusions find their way to hide in current relief
To keep conspiracies from baring our uncommon belief
An inspiration for the ones who strive a recreant leave
A glimpse of despair

Disturbances raise on against the splendous decay
Encourage teachings of a world that yearns for stoical preys
The evolution once took place but now inverted its rays
Attaining the end

Dying recognition in a time of immorality...

When faith was renewed in a forlorn betray
Realizing its attitude's way
An extravagated appearance breaks free
Forces the spirit of time to agree
But reign will end swiftly amidst agony
Demand staining conviction in black apathy

Injustice is the key unlocking live to confer
Forbidden measures carry on but force ourselves to refer
Communication tempts to split what the submissed would prefer
An endless desire

To reason by analogy and under duress
That outer troubles can be solved by quarreling onto noblesse
Instead of concentrate on flags of hope and act with distress
A desperate sin

Fighting for cognition in a mutual disease
Relinquished values got unleashed in aeons to appease
Protection led astray and finally found its great unease
So ends this condemnation in an ardor of morality

As darkness descends on this reaming extremes
Forces the spirit of time to agree
But reign will end swiftly amidst apathy
Demand staining conviction in black agony
