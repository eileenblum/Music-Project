Darkness surrounds my suffering soul
On my way through eternity
My death has yet not been the end
But immortality is no reward

It seems that there's no end for me
Seeing just this timeless space
Like in my life, I can't find the sense
That keeps me living on

The blood of a thousand perished men
Paves my path of gloom and tears
The haunted souls cry out in pain
As they're destined to die

My fate is left to someone else
Though I never believed in it
The last glimmer of hope decays
As there won't be an end
