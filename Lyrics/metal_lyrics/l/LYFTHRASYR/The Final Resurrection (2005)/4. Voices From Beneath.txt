My sins will be gone, nefariously in dawn
Suffering matyrdom as my own reward
Prospects forever beeing tongue-tied
The last wishes won't be denied
My legend breathes through sweet death that gratifies myself

Now paling grey skies, my revenge upon life
And knowing the raptures, that my soul discaptured
Possessed by fragments of decay
But fighting against me to delay
My legend breathes through sweet death that gratifies myself

Crawling in awful stealth to me
To ransack my poisoned soul for the key
Prospects forever beeing tongue-tied
The last wishes won't be denied
My legend breathes through sweet death that gratifies myself

Where I have to bleed upon my knees
Rear the eternal tragedies
Possessed by fragments of decay
But fighting against me to delay
My legend breathes through sweet death that gratifies myself

Salvation in mine of being maligned
Sick constellations that have been declined
On this world along my paradise's gone
The edge in my hand shows me I am the one
Temptations expired the body retires
Led to the end by my darkest desires
Serrations grow on and finally the dawn
Discovered me here in the throne of my mesmerized dreams...
