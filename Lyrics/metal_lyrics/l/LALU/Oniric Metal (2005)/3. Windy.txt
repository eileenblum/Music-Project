[Music: Vivien Lalu, Lyrics: Martin LeMar]

Hello, are you there?
Just pick-up, let us talk
It's okay, if you don't
I understand if you don't want to talk to me

Let me know that you're okay and you are fine
I am here and I'll wait if I have to - 'til the end of time
For you

Hello...
Can you hear me on the phone?
Here I am, and I regret
You can hear everything, I bet

TELL ME WHY DO WE WASTE OUR TIME WITH THINGS LIKE BEING SAD?
YOU WERE MY PRIVATE HEAVEN AND AT THE END YOU DRIVE ME MAD!
JUST PICK-UP THE PHONE!!

Hello!
Can you hear me on the phone?

Hello...
Hello...
Hello...
Are you there?

Just pick-up!
