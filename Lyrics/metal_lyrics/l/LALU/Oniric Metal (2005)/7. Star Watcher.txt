[Music: Vivien Lalu, Lyrics: Martin LeMar]

One thousand billion suns
Shining Bright
Shining Light
Shine one me
Like uncounted - unnumbered eyes
They're staring back at me

"Watch the stars"

I hover between these stars
Wandering, wondering
And a comet's streaking my fingertips in its tail:
Eternity

"Our life seems to be an eye shut of Eternity,
Interest seems to be illusion of conformity"

I am wandering through the stars
Ocean of a billion eyes
Watching every step I made under their lights
I'm reaching for the center
Reaching for answers
But there's just silence in the songs of space

I'm just dancing through their lights
And I can't stop dreaming now
So I am still watching the stars from above

I take, but can't believe-
I take, but can't believe what I saw

I take
I reach for the center
Reaching for answers
But there's just silence in the songs of space

Walk with me
Come with me
Watch the stars
