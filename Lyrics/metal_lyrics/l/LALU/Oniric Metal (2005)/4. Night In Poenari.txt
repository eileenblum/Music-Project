[Music: Vivien Lalu, Lyrics: Martin LeMar, Vivien Lalu]

[Count Dracula:]
"I am here, In the dark, waiting for you
Welcome to Poenari - In the scar of the night"

[Markus Belmont:]
"I clasp my stake tight
I move on, walking through the night of this world
Oh filth, I know what to do with the stake!
I will move on and bring it to you...

...into your vault
Into the dark
Into your soul
Into your heart

I swear that I saw a shadow behind me
ThereÂ´s a creature - It hunts for my flesh
I hunt the Vampyre, it is now my prey
ThereÂ´s no escape, I will find it before sunrise"
