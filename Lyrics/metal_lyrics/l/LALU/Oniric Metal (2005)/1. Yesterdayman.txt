[Music: Vivien Lalu, Lyrics: Martin LeMar]

I loved to live here, and that's why I sold my dreams
Now that I am downed again, I think it's time to leave

Yesterday's gone and the world has changed already
And even this place will never be the same
If you wanna reach me, all you have to do is to write me a letter
Addressed to the "Yesterdayman"

I thought things would change
But I hoped "in better"

The only thing that never changes
Is mankind in its "art of hate"
Is this the education of our generation?
What is life?

So I'll leave this place
Search for me under palms
I need an out time for a while
I'll send you postcards from my isle
Why can't we live together - does it really matter?
What's our faith??

Yesterday's gone and the world has changed already
And even this place will never be the same
If you wanna reach me, all you have to do is to write me a letter
Addressed to the "Yesterdayman"
