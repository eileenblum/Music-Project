[Music: Vivien Lalu, Lyrics: Martin LeMar]

Restless days lead astray
Life seems to be a weary journey
I kept my dreams and made my way regardless of losses
But once in a month I've the blues

And this emotion's still alive
As long as the moonlight

Uneasy, Obsessed...
Am I cursed?
Am I blessed?

And this emotion still survives
As long as the moon shines on me

My sweet melancholy
Is our search for blessedness aimless aspiration?

I won't believe
I don't want to grieve
I can't accept to be twisted
Depending on moonlight that victimizes me

Satellite! Bane of my life!
Don't shine on me this demanding!

Oh, this emotion's still alive
As long as the moonlight
And this emotion still survives
As long as the moon shines on me
In melancholy

There's no regret for being sad sometimes
It's the "Soulish" aspect of our mind
That it matters sometimes that we care

This lost emotion's still alive
As long as the moonlight
