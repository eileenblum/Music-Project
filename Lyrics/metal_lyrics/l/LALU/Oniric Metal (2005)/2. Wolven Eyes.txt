[Music: Vivien Lalu, Lyrics: Martin LeMar]

I am under your skin
I'm right here
I'm the animal within
You can see me
When you look in the mirror
Take a look at me
Take a look behind these eyes
Behind the shelter of immodest pride
You will find
Just a matter of time

Clear your mind and don't be afraid
Afraid to loose control
Don't you fear me, it's okay
At the end you will see
As long as you aren't dead it's not too late to feel
Behind these eyes
Behind the shelter of immodest pride
You will find what's the call of the wild
Behind wolven eyes

Wolven eyes
Wolven eyes
Wolven eyes

Don't be afraid because you're not alone
There are so many kinfolks wherever you may roam
And at the end you'll see Darwin was right
We've got more of an animal than wolven eyes

Can you hear our children singing?
Can you hear them howling in the night?
I can hear my kinfolks singing
I can hear them howling in the night

Now peel down your skin, don't you know:
There's an animal within you!
I can see you, I can smell - I know better:
I can see through these eyes!
I CAN SEE THROUGH THESE EYES!

And at the end you'll see Darwin was right
We've got more of an animal than wolven eyes
Wolven eyes
They can see through your immodest pride
They will find what they hunt for tonight
Wolven Eyes
