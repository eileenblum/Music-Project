Forced to move
To be a part of the line
Naked and your eyes full of fear
I see you â I hit you â make you move how I want
Don't you dare to try and fight back
You had been drugged but you are very aware
Of the meat hooks I force through your skin
The pain makes you faint but I will keep you awake
We are far from over my friend

It's like a not ending gruesome nightmare
But all this is real and true
Bathed in blood and gore you try to scream as
Consciousness is leaving you

Head over heels
I'll cut your throat with a knife
Your life is streaming down to the ground
While you're still breathing I'm removing your skin
Slicing â cutting â tear you apart

It's like a not ending gruesome nightmare
But all this is real and true
Bathed in blood and gore you try to scream as
Consciousness is leaving you

Cut â packed and shipped
You go to different places of the world
They gonna love you medium rare!
