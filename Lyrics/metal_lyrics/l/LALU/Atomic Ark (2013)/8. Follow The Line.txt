Running in circles
The trail is broken
No pheromone
Where should we go
What should we do
Moving forward
Looking for signs
Marking the path
Exploring new ways
To overcome this obstacle

For million years
We have ruled this world
Even time can't stop us
Together we'll survive

Oh â we follow the line
Oh â we must follow the line

[Keyboard solo: Jens Johansson]

Collective brain
Eyes in an eye
Warrior or slave
We are equal
We are one
Defend the nest
Protect the young
Breed with the queen
And make another thousand sons

We colonized every landmass of Earth
We're here to stay
We will last for evermore

Follow the line...

[Nylon guitar: Joop Wolters]
