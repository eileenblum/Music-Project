A last song to the moon
Honoring my ancestors
I am the last one of my tribe
See what they have done to us

You turned aside the veil of anger
Let me remain in self control
Not to give back as we were given
And you've let me stand tall

I  respected life
Without ignorance in my own heart
Spoken only truth
And never killed another man

Now help me face the fear I feel
Let me keep up self control
Because I am your last warrior
But now my time has come
Lead me home tonight

Unequa
Great spirit
Guide me home tonight
Unequa
Great spirit
It's a good night to die

I see the horses ride beneath
The bird above - they're greeting me
I hear my brothers howl my name

Farewell to the moon and sun
The Earth - the wind - the stars
And all the sacred things I have to leave behind

When I'm gone you'll hear me sing
My song's still carried by the wind
Remember me when you hear its melody

That's how I survive...
