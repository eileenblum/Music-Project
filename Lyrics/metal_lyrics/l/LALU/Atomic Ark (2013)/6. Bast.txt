She spoke to me
With a youthful frisky fire in her eyes
If I'd despair
With pleasure she would be my guide
I long for her hand
And wish she would lead me into further spheres

Like a king
She shall protect me till the day I die
And all too willingly
To her I abandon myself

See her eyes
Reflect the sun even in the darkest night
Sending a shiver down my spine
See her grace
When â swaying â she is coming next to me
I want to drink wisdom from her lips

And soil her grace
With lust
Bast
I belong you

See her skin
Silken perfection from head to toe
And her body is screaming for sin
I take her hand
And let her lead me to further spheres

And soil her grace
With lust
Bast
I love you so

Divine feline
The magic only worked by womankind
And all too willingly
To them we abandon ourselves

[Guitar solo: Simone Mularoni]

And soil her grace
With lust
Bast!
