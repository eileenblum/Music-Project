Day by day I see you with that sad look on your face
It is almost unbearable 'cause with your smile you also lost your grace

Your mirror â soiled
The water â calm
A heart beats in the void
And with every day that's passing by
Another dream will die

Embrace every moment you got
Love every breath that you take
With all your heart
With all your mind

[Keyboard solo: Jens Johansson]

I can't help you anymore 'cause we go on separate ways
You don't have to love me but you ought to love yourself
I can still remember your beauty in those days
Your heart was light â please don't imprison your mind
Everything is alright

Embrace every moment you got
Love every breath that you take
With all your heart
With all your mind.

[Drum solo: Virgil Donati]
