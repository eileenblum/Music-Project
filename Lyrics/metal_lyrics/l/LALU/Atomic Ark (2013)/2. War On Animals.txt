[Mike Andersson:]
Isolated into a lab
Electrodes sticking to my brain
I am analyzed

[Martin LeMar:]
They insert poison in my skin
Is this for real
They trigger cancer in my cells
Will I survive

[Martin &amp; Mike:]
No more killing - no more testing - no more pain
Let's end this war on animals
No more suffering - no more dying - no more chains
Let's end this war on life
Let's end this war on animals

[Mike Andersson:]
Mutilated into a cage
So many tumors in my brain
I am paralyzed

[Martin LeMar:]
They force viruses in my veins
What have I done
They say they must find a cure
For human race

[Martin &amp; Mike:]
No more killing - no more testing - no more pain
Let's end this war on animals
No more suffering - no more dying - no more chains
Let's end this war on life
Let's end this war on animals

[Mike:]
No more killing - no more pain

[Martin:]
Will they pay for their deeds
After this war they lead?
