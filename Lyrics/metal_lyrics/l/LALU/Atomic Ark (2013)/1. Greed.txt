Here we are
The summit of creation
We are here to stay
While other kind must fade

Don't blame us now
It's natural selection
We hold the crown
The fittest will outlast

[Guitar solo: Marco Sfogli]

Economy
Is blooming like a bad weed
We are so well
You ought to love our grace

Industry
Our new and proven idol
Epiphany
We are here to rule the world

Kingdom of lies bound to expire
The die is not yet cast but you wear blinders
Open your eyes and break the cycle
Malicious greed has led us to nothing at all

[Guitar solo: Marco Sfogli]

Don't blame us now
It's natural selection
We hold the crown
The fittest will outlast

Epiphany
We are here to rule and we are here to stay
We are so well
You ought to love our race

Kingdom of lies bound to expire
The die is not yet cast but you wear blinders
Open your eyes and break the cycle
Malicious greed has led us to nothing at all
