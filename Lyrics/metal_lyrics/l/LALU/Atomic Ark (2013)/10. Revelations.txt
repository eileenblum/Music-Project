[Part I â Storm]

[Part II â Haunted Memories]

The summer's breeze is stroking me
While I'm on my outpost
Without a sound or slightest move
In camouflage among the bushes

I'm waiting for the night to fall
Until then I behold and watch you through my scope
Holding back the urge to pull the trigger now
That would be over much too fast
Way too easy

I know you were a part of me
On the path of my past
You gave me home
You were father to me
I still know
I remember
I know I lost a part of me
On the path of my past
By the things that I've done
And the things I have seen
What I saw
And still remember

You gave me hope but in the end you let me fall
There's no other reason but of money after all
Have you ever felt what I felt â was everything a lie
Thus far we came â now look at us
Tooth for tooth
Eye for an eye

I am waiting for the night to fall
Until then I behold and watch you through my scope
Holding back the urge to pull the trigger now
That would be over much too fast
Way too easy

I know I lost a part of me
On the path of my past
By the things that I've done
And the things I have seen
What I saw and still remember

You gave me hope but in the end you let me fall
There's no other reason but of money after all
Have you ever felt what I felt â was everything a lie
Thus far we came â now look at us
Tooth for tooth
Eye for an eye

You sacrificed my life for greed
On the path in the dark
I am risk for your fame
With the things I have seen
What I saw and still remember

It's been a while since you left me back for dead
But here I am â I'm still alive and I will not forget
I made a vow to myself
What to do if I survive
There's no other option anymore
Than fulfillment

[Part III â The Big Hunt]

The outer wall was unsecured
And too easy to overcome
I cut lose all the trip-wire
Without the slightest sound
First the outer cameras
Then the whole system is shutting down
And when the light goes out completely
You are sure that I'm around

Step by step
I came closer now
And there is nothing you can do
Unnecessary to convince you
Of the things I'm able to
I was a loaded gun in your locker
The assassin you have groomed
This is what you trained me for
Now I'm here to hunt for you

Oh â where are you now
Oh â you're trying to hide

Before the rays of the morning sun
I'm gonna end your trial of pain
And neither money or your promises
Will finally save you from my wrath
I'm the product of your efforts
The nemesis you made yourself
My eyes been shut for much too long
Now I am awake

Where are you now
Are you afraid
Face your fate
Where are you now
Are you afraid
Just be a man
Face your fate

You know it's true
I gonna get you
I'm here â I gonna get you

[Guitar solo: Joop Wolters]

I am not like you
I won't give in to the anger I felt
You'll survive to dismantle all your lies

[Part IV â Sick of Your Lies]

We are on air now â make an effort
Give the camera a smile
Don't fuss my friend
You are alive
You will survive to dismantle your lies

Talk â talk â keep talking for your life
And don't be scared to tell the truth
We want to hear about the cruelties
You did in search for wealth
[Repeat]

Mission completed
You are alone â no one left to beguile
The message is seeded
The world now will know
We are sick of your lies

Talk â talk â keep talking for your life
And don't be scared to tell the truth
We want to hear about the cruelties
You did in search for wealth
[Repeat]

Mission completed
You are alone â no one left to beguile
The message is seeded
The world now will know
We are sick of your lies

We are on air now â make an effort â give the camera a smile
Don't fuss my friend
You are alive
We are sick of your lies

Talk â talk â keep talking for your life
And don't be scared to tell the truth
We want to hear about the cruelties
You did in search for wealth
[Repeat]

[Part V â Call to Arms]

So â what now
The first one is gone
He got his ticket to jail
But there are others around
There is so much to do
In this snake pit of lies
And now I feel that the seed
Is growing fast in my mind

I know that you're out there
You are knowing â and see
Feel like looking in the mirror
When you hear about me
A cry
A vow
An offer of indulgence
Just take the matters in your hands
And stand up now to follow me

Oh â can you hear my call to arms
We will pay them back what they began

I know that you're out there
You are knowing â and see
Feel like looking in the mirror
When you hear about me
A cry
A vow
An offer of indulgence
Just take the matters in your hands
And stand up now to follow me

I know you are many
We are anon and free
No need for violence
We are better than them
We shall rise
We shall stand
Against the empire of lies
Your eyes been shut for much too long
Now you shall awake

Oh â can you hear my call to arms
We will pay them back what they began

[Guitar solo: Joop Wolters]

Kingdom of lies bound to expire
The die is not yet cast
Open your eyes
And break the cycle.
