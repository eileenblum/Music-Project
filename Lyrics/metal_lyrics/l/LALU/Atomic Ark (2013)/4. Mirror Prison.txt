The water is calm
Her mirror is soiled
The beat of her heavy heart
Echoes in the void
Almost unheard

She's not alone
But love slowly fades
A perfect surrounding
She got all that she needs
So why should it change
Why take a risk for the unknown
That lies far in the world behind the mirrors

With every day that's passing by
She sacrifices her dreams of the world
Behind the glass.
