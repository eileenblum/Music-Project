Drowning in the deep that surrounds me
While I slowly go down - alight
On the ground of the sea

I lie awake
Down in my haven
From a coral reef
Gently entwined

Silver light
Is breaking through the surface
Enchants the world
And makes me smile

I swim with the whales
To the shores of your world
I listen to your songs
And behold you from a distance
At night I'll lay a starfish
Down at your feet
To bear remembrance that I am
Down in the deep blue sea

I am the salmons in the bay
The darkness in the Mariana Trench
I am the Kraken in the deep
The beginning of the tides
The source of life

I swim with the whales
To the shores of your world
I listen to your songs
And behold you from a distance
At night I'll lay a starfish
Down at your feet
To bear remembrance that I am
I am the sea

[Guitar solo: Simone Mularoni]

Drowning in the deep that surrounds me
While I slowly go down - alight
On the ground of the sea.
