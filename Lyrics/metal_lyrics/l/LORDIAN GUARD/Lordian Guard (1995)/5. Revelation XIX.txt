They march across the foreign fields of battle.
The kingdoms of the earth have come to war.
Like the Tower of Babel, the nations reach their destiny.
Against the Lord, they raise their flaming swords.

But the heavens will roar, and the thunders will cry.
Who can deny, that the Day of the Lord is drawing nigh . . .

The mighty men of war besiege Jerusalem.
The city of our God is left alone.
But the nation of Israel will cry out for Messiah.
And Christ the King will raise His holy sword.

And the heavens will roar, the thunders will cry.
Who can survive, when the sword of the Lord
breaks through the sky . . .
