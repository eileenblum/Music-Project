It was a darkened day December,
I heard the hammer in the wind.
It was a day we will remember
for the Winds of Thor their story would begin.

For you are the rich man, and we are the poor.
You have the power, but the force we have will blow forever more.
Winds of Thor, Winds of Thor . . .

Now you've come to our kingdom,
And you've taken all that we have.
And your king sends his brigades,
To take our lives and lead us to our death.

For you are the mighty, and we are the low.
You have the power, but the force we have will roar forever more.
Winds of Thor, Winds of Thor . . .

The warships of Odin have landed.
The thunders of Thor have sounded.
And now you will fall in the valley of tears . . .

We will invoke the mighty Winds of Thor.
We will invoke the mighty Winds of Thor.
