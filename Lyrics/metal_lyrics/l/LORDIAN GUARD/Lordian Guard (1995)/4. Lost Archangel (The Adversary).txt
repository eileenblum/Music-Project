"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him
Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! For the
Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he
knoweth that he hath but a short time (Revelation 12:9, 12).

The fallen one has come to rule,
From the holy skies.
Spreading wrath and razing ruin,
'Til the Second Coming of Christ.

The kings they kneel before his throne,
Veiled in scarlet robes.
And in his name their story's born,
And in his name they carve their stones.

The Adversary of the Lord,
He wields his famines and his wars.
The Adversary will be slain,
Christ the King will ever reign!

The Adversary of the Lord,
he seeks to devour, and he means to destroy your soul.
The Adversary, he will fall,
By the wrath of the everlasting God.

Billions of souls will perish in his fires,
In the endless day of the damned,
On the judgment day of man.
Woe to this worldand the evils we have chosen,
By the pride and the will of man,
A kingdom built on sand . . .

The Adversary of the Lord,
He wields his famines and his wars.
The Adversary will be slain,
Christ the King will ever reign.
The Adversary of the Lord,
He seeks to devour, and he means to destroy your soul.
The Adversary, he will fall,
By the wrath of the everlasting God . . .
