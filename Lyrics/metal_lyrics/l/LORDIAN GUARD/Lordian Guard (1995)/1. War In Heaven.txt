They rise from their fiery region,
On dragon like wings, by thousands they've come to war.
And dark are the Seraphic Legions,
With armor and shield, they raise their flaming swords.

In the name of the Archangel Lucifer,
The Legions hath come, to divide and to conquer
Thy kingdom, Thy power, Thy throne,
The Seraphic Legions they goe . . .

The celestial armies of heaven,
Descend from the Sovereign sky forth God's command.
And lo, Michael with sword in hand,
He leads the Lordian Guard to slay, to damn.

In the name of the Almighty Father,
The angels hath come to cast out the Legions
Forever, to the infernal realm,
From heaven to hell . . .

On chariots of thunder and lightning,
On Lordian Steeds, the angels smite their foe.
And the Seraph they fall to destruction,
As the hounds and the carrion of hell feast on their corpse.

Now lost is the Archangel Lucifer,
Who thought in his mind, he could rise to empyrean dominion,
'Til fate was his foe,
The will of God his woe . . .
