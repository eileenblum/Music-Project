Do you hear that special feeling in the air,
A time of peace on earth, a chance to share.
And the year has walked into our thoughts of yesterday,
We find a way of giving, we find the path of care.

It's Christmas time again,
Our Christ is born again.

When we clear away the sadness of reality,
We find that Christmas time is near.
When we hark to children's carols in the winter breeze.
The candle in our hearts, it burns with love, it glows with cheer.

It's Christmas time again,
Our Christ is born again.
Joy to all the earth and good will towards men,
Christ the Lord . . . In Peace He Comes Again.

When the season passes by will we remember Him,
Or wait until December comes again.
When we tear away the gift of curiosity,
Forever may we seal inside our hearts the noble tree.

It's Christmas time again,
Our Christ is born again.
Joy to all the eath and good will towards men,
Christ the Lord . . . In Peace He Comes Again.

It's Christmas time again,
To give to share with friends.
