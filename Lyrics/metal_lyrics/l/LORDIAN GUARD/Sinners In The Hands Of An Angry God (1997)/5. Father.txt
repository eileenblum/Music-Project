[dedicated to Nicholas Tsamis, 1925-1985]

Father, if all I can be is a man
And all I can ask of you Father, my Father
How can I be in your plan?

Send me a sign from the heavens, in riddle or rhyme
Descend from the skies of forever, pray give me a time
For I have reached the end of the line . . .

Defender of truth and of freedom, am I living a lie?
I render my fruits to thy kingdom, pray give me a sign
For I am weak, how long can I fight?

Father, when can I see you again?
And when can I be with you Father,
You gave up your life for me then,
And when, I needed you Father . . .
When can I see you again?
And when can I be with you Father,
You gave up your life for me then,
And when, I needed a friend . . .

Father, your spirit I'm longing to bring
Through tears can I ask of you Father, my Father
To play your song through my strings . . .

Father, when can I see you again?
And when can I be with you Father,
You gave up your life for me then,
And when, I needed you Father . . .
When can I see you again?
And when can I be with you Father,
You gave up your life for me then,
And when, I needed a friend . . .
