They placed a crown of thorns on His head
A scepter in His hand
"Hail, to the King of the Jews," they said
They did not understand.

Like a lamb to the slaughter
they led Him away as the prophets foretold.
He carried our sins and our sorrows,
to Golgotha, to the place they call the Skull.

Now Satan came to Jerusalem
"The death of God," his command
"Give us Barabbas," the people said
They did not understand.

Like a lamb to the slaughter
they led Him away as the prophets foretold.
He carried our sins and our sorrows,
to Golgotha, to the place they call the Skull.

"For dogs have compassed me
The assembly of the wicked have inclosed me
The pierced my hands and my feet
I may tell all my bones
They look and stare upon me
They part my garments among them
and cast lots upon my vesture" (Psalm 22:16-18).

Worthy is He who was slain on the cross
The Messiah, the King of the universe!
Honor and pow'r, glory and might
To the God of the skies, to the Lord of earth!
Every knee shall bow, and every tongue
shall confess the Lord . . .

"He is despised and rejected of men
A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief,
and we hid as it were our faces from him
He was despised, and we esteemed Him not (Isaiah 53:3).
