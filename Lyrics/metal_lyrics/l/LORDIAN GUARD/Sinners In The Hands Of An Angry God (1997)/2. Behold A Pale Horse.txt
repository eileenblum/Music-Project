Come and see, the end of time
The ancient seals are broken
And the mouth of Hell is opened wide.

The kingdoms rage, the nations fall
Their blasphemies were spoken
Now the God of gods has come to conquer all!

Come and see, the end of man
The prophets they have spoken
Now the Judgment Day is now at hand.

The kings will hide in the caves of the earth.
As the people lament the day of their birth.
Behold the Pale Horse rides . . .
Behold the Pale Horse rides . . .
In the blood of the night
His spectre rides the moon
His holy sword in hand
The fear of God unleashed in the land . . .

Come and see, the wrath of God
The famines , wars, diseases
The sword of Damocles has fallen.

The earth in ruins, engulfed in fire
The nightmare of the ages
Prepare O man to meet thy God!

The kings will hide in the caves of the earth.
As the people lament the day of their birth.
Behold the Pale Horse rides . . .
Behold the Pale Horse rides . . .
Behold the Pale Horse rides . . .
The Pale Horse rides . . .
