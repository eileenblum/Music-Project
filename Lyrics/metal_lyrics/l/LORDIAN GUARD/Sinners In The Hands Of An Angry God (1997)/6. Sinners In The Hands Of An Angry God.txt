O my friends, my soul cries out to you from the infernal fire
How dreadful it is to suffer the fierceness and wrath of God
for one moment . . . but I must suffer it for all eternity.

There will be no end to this exquisite horrible misery
When I look forward I see a long forever,
a boundless duration before me which devours
my thoughts and terrifies my soul .
For I know certainly that I must wear out long ages,
millions and millions of ages, in wrestling and
conflicting with this divine merciless vengeance.
And when I am so done, when so many ages have
actually been spent in this manner.
In know, that this is all but a point to what remains.
[Based on Jonathan Edwards' classic homily, 1741]

It came upon me unexpected
Like a thief, Death outwitted me
O my foolishness
I was arrogant towards God and man,
pursuing my own vanities
And when I said, "All is well,"
Then, sudden destruction came upon me.

Day of the damned at the throne they stand
Sinners in the hands of the God of man.
Who is the One enthroned in the sky?
Behold it is Christ, in glory and might
Yes He, the One they crucified.

Who can withstand the weight of divine vengeance?
There is no fortress or power that can defend
us from the power of God . . .
For as wax melteth before the fire, so shall the
wicked, at the presence of the Lord.

Vengeance is mine, a thunderous rhyme
A frightening voice to the blasphemous mind
Who is He who roars from the sky?
Behold it is Him, the Conqueror of sin
Yes He, the One they crucified.

Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God
The fire awaits my soul
To the chasm of Hell I will go . . .

Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God
The fire awaits my soul
For the Devil and demons I know . . .

And who can save me now . . . I don't know.
Or who can wake me from this terror I behold.
