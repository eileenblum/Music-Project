By lightning by thunder, by gathering of winds
A chariot of silver and gold descendeth and taketh me in.
My eyes behold wonder, as I gaze on this land
To terra I bow down my head, to heaven I raise up my hands!

Thy power, Thy glory
I tow'r o'er the skies
I sail to a story
To a tale of darkness and light . . .

Through Virgo through Leo, I follow the signs
My guide to millennial past, empyrean divine
Through great constellations, Piscean domain
I race through sidereal skies, across the Stygian wave!

Thy power, Thy glory
I tow'r o'er the skies
I sail to a story
To a tale of darkness and light . . .

On Lordian winds I soar across the Stygian Passage
I see immortality cease in my course . . .
