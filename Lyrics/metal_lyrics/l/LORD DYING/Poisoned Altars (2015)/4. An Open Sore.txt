Wasted life form 
Twisted master 
Appropriately 
Over under 

Shining brightly 
Inside open 
A finding so sweet 
A journey under 

As we wake up 
Darkness waning 
This understanding 
Undertaking 

Nothing left now 
But an open sore 
Show us the future 
Show us the score 

I won't rest until you're gone 
Understanding that you've won 
Another time for anyone 
One last sigh 

Wasted life form 
Twisted Master 
A finding so sweet 
A journey under 

Nothing left now 
But an open sore 
Show us the future 
Show us the score 

I wont rest until you're gone 
Understanding that you've won 
Another time for anyone 
One last sigh 

Feels like we fanned this flame forever 
And damned these rains since they begun 
But now the waterâs taking over 
Dousing the fire that never burns 

And now the sky itself is falling 
It can no longer hold the sun 
Without the light we were creating 
Our future life may never come 

I wont rest until you're gone 
Understanding that you've won 
Another time for anyone 
One last sigh 

One last push into the sun 
Shining bright for everyone 
Another night another dawn 
One last high
