Disease to cause unease
Is what we follow blindly
Obscure spells and cures
For all and everybody

The damned are conjuring
You shape, forever wanting
Perfect and oh so sane
So vain, and never taunting

Worship an unseen force
No hope for understanding
Your faith is always worthless
Always too demanding
