Inside this lair built of hate
The sickness overtakes
Another step ahead
And one behind

Past scars open up
As blood begins to flow
The sores infected
And will never heal

Forever sores and sun
We gather to become
Another burn so near
Nothing changes over here

Blood trickles under
The softest embrace

We hope for rendezvous
One last destructive move
The blood will subside soon
Lust found and love subdued

Blood trickles under
The softest embrace

You understand me like no one I know
Please be behind me, Iâll let no one know

Light dims in overview
Torment was all I knew
Extinguish all I feel
Until I cannot heal

Blood trickles under
The softest embrace

You understand me like no one I know
Please be behind me, Iâll let no one know
Iâm your forever, behind you Iâll prove
Once and forever the world will undo

Another answered call
A wound befit for all
An anger runs so deep
For all that you shall reap

Blood trickles under
The softest embrace

You understand me like no one I know
Please be behind me, Iâll let no one know
Iâm your forever, behind you Iâll prove
Once and forever the world will undo
