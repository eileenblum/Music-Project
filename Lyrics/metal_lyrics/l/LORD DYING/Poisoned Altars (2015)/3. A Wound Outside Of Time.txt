I'll see that you complete 
Your suffering 
Walk alone into night 
Truth you'll find 
Secrets lie in this hell 
Stories they tell 
Answers lie on the other side 
Tonight we ride 

Our Path is set, our fires burn bright 
As we head into the night 
You feel the power raging through your veins 
Follow us into the flames 

Weâre reborn unto night 
Outside of time 
Nothing left only death 
WE NEVER REST 
As we watch the blood flow free 
We satisfy our needs 
Answers lie on the other side 
Tonight we ride
