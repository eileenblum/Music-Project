Fire like stars
Illuminate
Wisdom leads, shadows escape
The clearing at the endâ¦

Ferocious me
Consuming Everything

Understand days
To medicate
A time to live, a time to hate
Assuming everythingâ¦

We will survive the night and
Weâll never admit defeat
Transgress and leave behind all
Forgotten enemies

Iâll feel the cold
Burning as of late
We transform, we subdue
Contemplate escape
