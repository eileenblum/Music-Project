Priests and their clergy 
Royalty unbound 
Pastors and prophets 
Religion unfound 

False implications 
Of terror on the rise 
Fleeting beliefs and 
Impossible highs 

Reason holding holes 
Endless punching deep 
Rotting out our bones 
Killing all that need 

Endless attachment 
Understanding Scars 
Losing your faith and 
Poisoning Altars 

All this religion 
Promises in place 
None understanding 
Disgrace with grace 

Reason holding holes 
Endless punching deep 
Rotting out our bones 
Killing all that need
