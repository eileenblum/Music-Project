Darkness Remains Complete
In sight of day sinking
A willing hand pushing
Darkness obtains, fucking
We will keep this right here
One more time out for fear
Iâll watch and youâll forget
Once more and thatâs this shit

We age
We subside
We rage
We canât hide

Darkness contains your luck
Forever under struck
A shock, an outside wish
An under over stitch
You grasp for precious air
All wounds become so clear
You scream and fall apart
And lose all your support

We Live
We release
We learn
To never see
