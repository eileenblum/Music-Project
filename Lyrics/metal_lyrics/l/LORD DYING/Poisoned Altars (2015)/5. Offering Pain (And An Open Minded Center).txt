We're faced with graves and names
Those we've loved and those we've shamed
We'll live, and so we'll die
A place to be so

Brave

I'll see light follow
Alone and low down
Every night

Martyrs burn with their red eyes
Our Lives have been so blind
We love and so we hate
Our lies will be so

Brave

I'll see light follow
Alone and low down
Every night

We'll live in another place
And in another time
A place without regret
We can be so

I'll calm down
As we lie
And I'll lie
as we lie

And I'll take
My last breath
And I'll stop
When I'm dead
