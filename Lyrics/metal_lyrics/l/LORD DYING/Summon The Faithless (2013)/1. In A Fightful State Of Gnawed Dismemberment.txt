I saw the heart of the asphalt going over me
That's when I said goodbye to the Earth
They tore apart her insides, raised hell from the sky
That's when I lost the love of my life

You'll find no peace to salvage
Only a peaceless savage

I saw the heart of the asphalt going over me
That's when I saw the ground looking down
They tore apart her insides, raised hell from the sky
That's when I lost the love of my life

You'll find no peace to salvage
Only a peaceless savage

I saw the heart of the asphalt going over me
That's when I said goodbye to the Earth
They tore apart her insides, raised hell from the sky
That's when I lost the love of my life

You'll find no peace to salvage
Only a peaceless savage
