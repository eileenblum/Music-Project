We saw life undermined
Hell hath all eyes denied
Scorn seer still living life
Wither enforce delight

We saw life undermined
Hell brings down fire tonight

He waits till there's nothing for our eyes
And they would say wait
Hate

We'll watch till there's nothing for our eyes
He waits till there's nothing for our eyes
And they would say wait
Hate

We'll watch till there's nothing for our eyes

All life is undermined
He smiles on this throne most high
Demon-form unto nigh
Adorned all life denied

He waits till there's nothing for our eyes
And they would say wait
Hate

We'll watch till there's nothing for our eyes
He waits till there's nothing for our eyes
And they would say wait
Hate

We'll watch till there's nothing for our eyes

All life is undermined
He smiles on this throne most high
Demon-form unto nigh
Adorned all life denied
