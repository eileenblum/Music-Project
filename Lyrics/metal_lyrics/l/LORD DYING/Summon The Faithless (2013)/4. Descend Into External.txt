We watch the extinction of man
As we gaze towards the future
We see unlight drawn in
As we glimpse total horror

Rise
Rise to the future
Rise
Rise to the horror

We see light blistering
As it deadens our eyes
We wake towards total shame
We fall before our rise

Rise
Rise to the future
Rise
Rise to the horror

And we rise
Towards our demise
As it's done
End we'll see
Our destiny
As it's begun

We saw the destruction of man
As we gaze towards the future
We see the unlight drawn in
As we glimpse total horror

Rise
Rise to the future
Rise
Rise, total horror

And we rise
Towards our demise
As it's done
End we'll see
Our destiny
As it's begun

We see the extinction of man
As we glimpse towards the horror
We see unlight drawn in
As we gaze the future

And we rise
Towards our demise
As it's done
End we see
Our destiny
As it's begun
