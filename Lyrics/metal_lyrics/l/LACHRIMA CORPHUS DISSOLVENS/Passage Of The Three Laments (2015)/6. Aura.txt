[Lyrics: Antonio Ortiz, Music: LCD]

It was difficult to see the aura
For the window
New hours for your life, new time.

You wear the dawn,
You forget your past.

You left behind many things.
Now you find yourself
In a very dwelling
New hours for your life, new day

The time passes,
Is time to start a new road
The time becomes shorter for you,
But you left behind memories
That in the course of time they forget
The people dialogue among themselves,
They ask your destiny,
Very they know it within them
Very you deny it within you,
But you prefer to keep
On at your road and to survive

The ready nightfall will fall
The ready nightfall will fall and
You go after some refuge,
The stars guide you some place
That you refuse and morning
If it is feasible
You will have a new aura for you
