[Lyrics: Antonio Ortiz, Music: LCD]

My desire is to find you
My desire is to see
The light of your inside
Seeing what you conceal
Seeing what you conceal
Behind that glance
What reflect the great
What reflect the great
Beyond of the infinities
My desire is to roam
Your seeing behind your eyes
What many achieved and
Many did not know
How to understand

Seeing what you conceal
Behind that glance
What reflect the great
Beyond of the infinities

Many blinded by false
Promises and salvation
The truth this in your hands
Search in your inside
Listen the silence
This behind the shades
They observe you
You see towards the universe
The beginning
Of your start this there
The truth is out there
