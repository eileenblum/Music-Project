[Lyrics: Antonio Ortiz, music: LCD]

When being born of the dark light,
Reflect smiles of unknown,
Cries and cradle songs....
Blinded me and they calmed my lament,

I didn't understand the future for instants
The twelve infinite tortures and the pleasure
They showed me the real and the unreal....

Arrive to the stage of suffering,
And cause the pain and suffering.
I guided myself for sages,
And I destroyed false prophets

Try! That they enter to my mind,
Try! Of entering to their minds,
Try! Of understanding my origin and the death

Look for reasons
In the future and my past
Look for your consolation
And your comprehension
We met each other for instants and you
Taught me differences
We could not create another light,
Because we go for different directions
I remember your verses...
I remember my feeling toward you....
But I cannot forget of me.

The elixir and the smoke
They were so intense
As a torrential rain
And a thick fog.
The nature welcomed me in its arms
And it drove me to
My dreams and imaginations,

When concluding, in my solitude,
I travel with the light
To the divinity
Of the fourth dimension,
They showed me and
I understood many things,
As well as the pain
That we cause you.

When returning I wanted to amend
My sins and I got lost in the solitude,
And I gave myself account than,
The sun and the earth
They got away from me.....
