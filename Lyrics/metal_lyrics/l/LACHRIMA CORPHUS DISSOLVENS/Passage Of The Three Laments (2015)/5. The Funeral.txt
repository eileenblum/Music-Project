[Lyrics: Antonio Ortiz, Music: LCD]

I felt energy to slip for my side,
More and more strong it was feeling,
Every time I was approaching more
And the pain was stronger.

The truth soon would be revealed,
That what there is further on;
Roads of thorns adorned
The road soon to the arrival.

To me contour
Thousands of souls punish
Waiting is
The revelation.

Roads of thorns adorned
The road soon to the arrival.
Soon my truth arrived.
