[Lyrics: Antonio Ortiz, Music: LCD]

You received us
In your arms
You gave to us
Everything what
A being wanted
Unforgettable ways,
Fence where we were
Feeling your peace,
Rivers lakes and
Seas to purify
And to wash our entity,

You gave to us a darkness
To be able to hide our weeping,
To rest our body, our souls shelter
And you gave to us the light
To be able to see
The wonderful of your creation,

With your voice
You were giving us music,
Wind and cold when we had heat
With your tears you acted to your land
And this way she gave us
Of your fruit to continue in foot
With a landscape
Of clouds you were making
Happy the sky that gave us
You gave to us company with other
Beings to make our routine happy

You gave us wisdom,
You gave us everything
That wanted a being
But for our ambition,
We are destroying each other
We are destroying
The cover that gave us
And now we will have
To suffer your ire
