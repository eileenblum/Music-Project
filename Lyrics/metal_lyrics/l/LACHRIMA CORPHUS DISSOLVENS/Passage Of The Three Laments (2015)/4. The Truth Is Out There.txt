[Lyrics: Antonio Ortiz, Music: LCD]

I felt you again with this pain
Again in the crossroad that you are
You ask and questions
Looking for answers
Looking for exits
To a place that I ignore
Looking for a rest
Or something to experience

You look at me an and another time
Second after second
Planning to finish or to begin
They accompany you far to those
Cries and prayers
Beings accompany you
In this labyrinth that you are

The load that you take
Doesn't understand it
The tears prevent you to see
The pain wraps up
You don't understand the blame
You look for reasons in your dark past
Answers in your dreams
More questions?
Or riddles?

Slowly you move away from me
For then begin again
Or to finish
Slowly you move away your voice
Single whispers are listened
In this room dark!

Soon we will
Be again in this I dialogue
To begin or to finish
To go to a place that we ignore...
