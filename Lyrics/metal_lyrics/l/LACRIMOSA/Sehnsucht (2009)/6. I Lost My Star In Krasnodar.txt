Something else was in this place
Something I will never meet again
Something we will always think of
I saw the glance in your eyes
Before it disappeared
And I saw the disillusion in your eyes
Your terrible confusion
I killed a star in Krasnodar
I didn't see the death between my lips
I'm sorry for the things I said - and did not say

I am - I'm not afraid
I am - I'm not afraid of you

So I was blind for what I saw
So I was deaf for what I heard
I lost my star in Krasnodar
So I am cold for what I felt
So I am dead for I'm alive
I lost a star in Krasnodar
In Krasnodar

Shine - shine - shine - my star
Shine - shine - wherever you are

You are not here in this place
For I know we will not meet again
Therefore I will always think of you
Why can't you just see:
I am no alien - don't you know?
I am as black as white
Always the one who's fighting for
Someone to hold
I killed your smile
I killed your belief
I killed the star of Krasnodar
I didn't see the death between my lips
So sorry for the things I did -
And did not do

So I was blind for what I saw
So I was deaf for what I heard
I lost my star in Krasnodar
So I am cold to what I felt
So I am dead for I'm alive
I lost my star in Krasnodar
In Krasnodar

Shine - shine - shine - my star
Shine - shine - wherever you are
