I saw you with the flowers
They weren't ment for me - no
I saw you at the corner
You did not turn to me
For my heart is begging:

Call me - call me with the voice of love
Hold me - hold me in the arms of faith

You were the first - you were the last
I ever opened my heart to
Now you seam so far away
Come back and stay
For I say:

Call me - call me with the voice of love
Hold me - hold me in the arms of faith
Lead me - lead me to the gates of tenderness
Feel me - feel me as I feel for you
