Come a little bit closer
and hear what I've got to say
burning words of anger
of hate and desperation
What if I break the silence?
What if I do forgive the past?
I know, it might sound funny
to tell you what I felt
I mean, I really loved you
it's a shame - my fault - I know
but why - but why
why are you so stupid?
Fuck you and your killing lies
I hate your pissing attitude
why did you have to go so low
truler - Copycat
What if I break the silence?
What if I do forgive the past?
Sucking like a vampire
the blood of all your friends
but sorry, my blood was poisoned
now burn in Hell
You killed the love
You killed the trust...
What if I break the silence?
What if I do forgive the past?
