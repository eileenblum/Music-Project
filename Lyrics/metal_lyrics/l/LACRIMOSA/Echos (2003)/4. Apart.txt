So - you - said - that
I - shall - try - to go on

I've seen your eyes
They shined like stars to me
And then I saw your soul
An empty hall

Kissing you was like
Kissing the past
I felt like giving in

I felt like
Being a part of something
Something I was always
trying to achieve
I felt like
Being a part of something
Something that lasts

I've seen your ways
They sometimes took me
By surprise
And then I saw your aim
A ... lunatic

Touching you was like
Touching a flame
I felt like giving in

I felt like ...

And I need love
Like I never needed love before ...
