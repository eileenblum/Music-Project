If I knew how to fall asleep
When my heart is full
If I knew how to talk to keep your interest
If I knew how to walk that you turn to watch behind
If I knew â if I knew that...

I love shadows and pain â keep in touch
Take my precious advice â don't tease me â no
I will take your mind â come into my arms
Don't you dare to run and
Fear and hide

Feel the thunder of my heart
See the lightning of my soul
You make me burn
Don't fear the woman I am.

I hear lightning and thunder â but who cares
I feel safe in me â so get me flashed
I can't wait tonight â let us share our worlds
For the times to come â so let us play

Feel the thunder of my heart
See the lightning of my soul
You make me burn
Don't fear the woman I am.
