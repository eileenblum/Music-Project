Your eyes don't want to see
The beauty right in front of you,
'Cause your mind can't stand
The beauty right in front of you,
And your veins explode for
The beauty right in front of you,
When your body screams
For the softness of her milk-white skin.

And then you drop
Down to your knees
When she enters your world,
As she opens her lips

Skintight -- This is as close as you can get

And all it took was just one word
Skintight in all of my grace
From her to conquer you
In all of my grace
And all it took was just one look at her
I am the world
And you would follow her
I am success
And yet you know she did not speak to you
Money -- beauty -- that's me
She didn't see you though
Fever -- lust -- watch me
And when she leaves the room
You will feel alone and you will feel ashamed.

And then you drop
I'm -- all that you wish
Down to your knees
I am -- all that you need
When she enters your world
Watch -- but don't touch
As she opens her lips!
Skintight -- This is as close as you can get
