Now this is the mighty day
The one the time, the place
And you are â you are the one
The only one I love.
So, my love, my flesh and bone
Is this what you really want?

Take my hand and take my life
Now take my soul and be my wife.

I give my all to you. Will you do that too?
And if you do so too this means: it's me and you
And then you take my hand
And we walk down the aisle
Because this is our black, black wedding day...

You and me are one
'Cause we've exchanged our hearts.
This, my love, I promise you
I keep my faith, my loyalty
No force in this cold dark world
Can part us in eternity.

I give my all to you. Will you do that too?
And if you do so too this means: it's me and you
And then you take my hand
And we walk down the aisle
Because this is our black, black wedding day...

This is the day
You're on my way
This is real
This is now
This is our time
Black, black wedding day...
Black, black wedding day...
