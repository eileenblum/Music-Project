If The World Stood Still A Day
Would You Look At Me Quite Same?
The Winds Would Find Their Ways
But Not The Same Like Today
Falling Still Would Hurt
But Is The Pain Still The Same
If The World Stood Still A Day?

Would Youâve Forgiven
Iâd Stopped Caring
If The World Stood Still A Day?
Shall I Start Singing â Or Dancing
If The World Stood Still A Day?

Could We Know Itâs Just A Day
Would I Pray For A Change
Now Beign On My Way
Should I Stop Reaching My Aim
Have Trust In Love
And Faith For The Next Day
If The World Stood Still A Day?

Would Youâve Forgiven
Iâd Stopped Caring
If The World Stood Still A Day?
Shall I Start Singing â Or Dancing
If The World Stood Still A Day?

Could I Be â Should I Be Still Dancing
Laughing Full Of Tears?

Would Youâve Forgiven
Iâd Stopped Caring
If The World Stood Still A Day?
Shall I Start Singing â Or Dancing
If The World Stood Still A Day?

Oh â How Could We Know?
