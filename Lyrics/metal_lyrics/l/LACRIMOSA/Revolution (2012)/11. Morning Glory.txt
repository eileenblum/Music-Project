[Bonus Track]Â 
Those fucking birds are singing again
It's early morning, much too late and I'm wasted again
A Single Malt, a last cigarette...
And then I rather should be going to bed.
One last tango on the dancefloor of my mind
A little orphan that's crying deep inside
The morning takes this night that was so long
While Leonard's singing in the Tower of Song.
Â 
Morning Glory
For those who do not need to weep
But not for me; I'm into - I'm into me...
I was closing her eyes on me -
The loneliness won't leave me alone!
My heart - my heart falls like a stone...
Â 
By this time they might be naked in their showers
By this time they wash them clean from my insult
By this time I'm just the yesterday's man
Still impressing, just like I would be the fan
Can someone out there shoot those birds for me?
Can someone tell me what do you feel?
All you people without needs and desire -
Please come in and kill my always burning fire!
Â 
Morning glory
For those who do not need to weep
But not for me; I'm into...
I was closing her eyes on me!
The loneliness won't leave alone,
My heart, my heart falls like a stone
Â 
I can't bring the ghosts that holds me tight to seeing how...
...how, how, how could love be nightmare ?
Close her eyes on me...
Â 
Those fucking birds are singing again
It's early morning, much too late and I'm wasted again
A Single Malt, a cigarette.
And then I rather should be going to bed...
