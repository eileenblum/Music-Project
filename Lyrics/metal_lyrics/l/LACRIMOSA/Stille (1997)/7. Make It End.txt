Listen to the silence
Hear your blood running
Search for the truth
Hear the silence
Memories that made you mad
Hear, oh hear inside the fear
How different
Is this burning
Giving everything
And not finding back

Make it end
Don't force to suffer any more
No more empty promises
You go to find the truth for yourself
And accept it!
Make it end
No more degrading excuses
You go to -
Rise your weak wings
If only for a day

I've watched your purple blood running
Tasted the bitter taste of dying ambitions
Then the shadows in your eyes
How could you - loose the emotion
Of beeing alive?
Without hesitation
You stopped existing
Against your own will

Exit and escape
Gather the separated parts
Solve the puzzle and survive
Trust in yourself
You may also be weak -
Shattered emotions
When you watch behind the masks
No wasted words for the trusted ones
When they'd all let you down
