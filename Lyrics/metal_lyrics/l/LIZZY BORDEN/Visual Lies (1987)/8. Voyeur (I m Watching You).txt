I watch you only, I wish you only knew,
I am yours solely, I'm deep in lust with you.
You show me playthings I thought I'd never see,
But now I want to, to touch the real thing.

I'm ready for action, I'm ready for you,
I just can't hold it back, I'm exploding, I can't last,

Voyeur,
I'm chasing shadows in the night,
Voyeur,
I'm watching you, you're in my sights,

I know you so well, I know your every move,
I can't stop watching, I see what no-one could,
You move your body, untouchable display,
You make me crazy, because you don't know me.

I'm ready for action, I'm ready for you,
I just can't hold it back, I'm exploding, I can't last,

Voyeur,
I'm chasing shadows in the night,
Voyeur,
I'm watching you, you're in my sights,
Voyeur,
I'm holding on, obsessed inside,
Voyeur,
I'm watching, undercover spy.

I want you so bad, you don't know I'm alive,
You never notice me watching all the time,
Uncensored sightings undress you with my eyes,
I'm fantasizing you in suspended thighs.

I just can't hold it back, I'm exploding, I can't last,
I just can't turn away, I'm right behind you.
A glance away

[Repeat chorus x2]

I'm chasing shadows in the night,
I'm watching you, you're in my sights.
