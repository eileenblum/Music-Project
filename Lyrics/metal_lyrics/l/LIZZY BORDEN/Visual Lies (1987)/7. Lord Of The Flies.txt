I see a ship of fools, don't obey your rules,
Always fades away, never wanna play.
Carries loaded dice, sell your soul half price,
Nothing matters here, growing insincere.

And when the dream stands up and slips away,
And when the screams start to fly into the sky,
The dream dies.

Lord of the flies,
King of the killing sky,
Lord of the flies,
Dares you to cross the line,

Stripping all the gears, holding back the tears,
Got the goat all along, something don't belong
Instigating fear, paralyzing sneer,
Bark and then the bite, steal your heart just for spite.

And when the night burns brightly into day,
And when the light shines on without decay,
It's all lies.

Lord of the flies,
King of the killing sky,
Lord of the flies,
Dares you to cross the line,
Lord of the flies,
Never see eye to eye,
Lord of the flies,
Cutting you down to size.

And when the dream stands up and slips away,
And when the screams start to fly into the sky,
The dream dies.

Lord of the flies,
King of the killing sky,
Lord of the flies,
Dares you to cross the line,
Lord of the flies,
Never see eye to eye,
Lord of the flies,
Cutting you down to size.

Lord of the flies
Lord of the flies,
Lord of the flies.
