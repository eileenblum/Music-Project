I can't believe that I believed in you,
You know just what to say, though none of it is true.
You saw right through me, Oh was I easy prey,
Enticed my senses with lust I must obey.

I can hear the call, I can see it all,
I know you are my truth inside.

Visual lies
Visual lies

How could you betray me like a thief in the night,
You stole my eyes and showed me black when there was white.
I read between the lines, but still I don't see,
I've got no guarantees.

I can hear the call, I can see it all,
I know you are my truth inside.

Visual lies
Visual lies

I know you are my truth inside.

Visual lies
Visual lies
Visual lies
Visual lies.

Visual lies
Visual lies
Visual lies
Visual lies.

Visual lies
Visual lies
Visual lies
Visual lies.
