I see familiar strangers, from a sightless pair,
I came without warning, I don't play fair.
Shotgun - you're on the run, can't you feel me getting closer
Stand back, surprise attack, ultrasonic spectacle.

Plunging into the fire never losing sight
Blinded by your desire electrified, in the night, in the night.

Shock treatment
I'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment

Convulsive heart-throb flash in the air,
A bolt from the blue laser-beam stare
Blackout - I hear you shout phantom schemes (that) drain more power
Flashback we made a pact, now we want the pay-off

Plunging into the fire never losing sight
Blinded by your desire electrified in the night, in the night

Shock treatment
I'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
Shock treatment
I'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment

I'm coming out in sight alive and shocking
I'll materialize I'm turning it on for you

[x3]
Shock treatment
I'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
Shock treatment
I'm turning it on for you
Shock treatment
