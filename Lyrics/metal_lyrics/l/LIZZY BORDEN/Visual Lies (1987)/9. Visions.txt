Innocent eyes, open them wide for me,
I'm coming inside, to find what I know you can see.
The whole world is blind, except in your mind,
Lying there face down, reluctantly.
The fallen shall bow, the hope is here now,
I'm fading in timeless intensity.

Hear what I say tonight, for the time is right,
You are my light.
You must obey tonight, the seeds are right,
For the second sight

Turn on the vision.

Turn on what only you can see, it's in your mind.
Turn on the curse and watch closely, I'm on your line.
Turn on the vision.

No static is clear,
My actions speak louder than words,
But you mustn't fear,
Through my eyes you watch and you learn,
The night is so black, I wait to attack,
The silence is deafening, not a word.
You witness the fear you've seen through your mirror,
You psychic, you now wait your turn.

Hear what I say tonight, for the time is right,
You are my light.
You must obey tonight, the seeds are right,
For the second sight.

Turn on the vision.

Turn on what only you can see, it's in your mind.
Turn on the curse and watch closely, I'm on your line.
Turn on the vision.

Turn on what only you can see, it's in your mind.
Turn on the curse and watch closely, I'm on your line.
Turn on the vision.

Turn on what only you can see, it's in your mind.
Turn on your clairvoyant dreams, I'm on your line.
