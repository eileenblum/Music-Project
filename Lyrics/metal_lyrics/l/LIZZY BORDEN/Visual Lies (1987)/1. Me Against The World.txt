Leave me alone, I'm on the defense,
I'm not made of stone, why doesn't it ever make sense.
I'm sick of all this indecision, you're messing with my mind,
This ain't no false facade and this ain't no freak disguise.

'Cause I am for real, you don't know what I feel,
My strength is in my will,
I cannot wait, I won't be second rate,
In for the kill,

It's me against the world,
Me against the world.
It's me against the world,
Me against the world.

Inside, looking outside through a goldfish bowl
It's handover mouth stares that make me lose control
If I'm an outcast - I'm not the last, I'm gonna have my say,
They'll never take me alive, I'm gonna make them all pay.

'Cause I am for real, you don't know what I feel,
My strength is in my will,
I cannot wait, I won't be second rate,
In for the kill,

It's me against the world,
Me against the world,
It's me against the world,
Me against the world,

Me against the world,
It's me against the world.
Me against the world,
It's me against the world.

You can't face my life, you just won't think twice,
I see it my way but I won't be the martyr
I know you see it wrong, the cover don't belong,
I'm holding tight, don't you push me too far.

It's me against the world
It's me against the world

Me against the world,
It's me against the world,
Me against the world,
It's me against the world,

It's me against the world,
Me against the world.
It's me against the world,
Me against the world.

Don't push me too far.
