Icy stares from upper echelon,
So confused, I just don't belong,
Out of place, the spotlights glare on me,
When you don't fit in, nothing comes naturally.

Ah, they're watching as I fall.
Ah, I'm not invisible - not like the rest.

I am an outcast, free at last,
So long, don't need you anyway.
Outcast, I am who I am, here to stay.

Solitaire, alone I stand,
It's all so clear, impressions falsely take command,
Distorted views, you see what you wanna see,
I'm not like you, there's more than meets the eyes in me.

Ah, they're watching as I fall.
Ah, I'm not invisible - not like the rest.

I am an outcast, free at last,
So long, don't need you anyway.
Changes, I am who I am, here to stay.

I'm an outcast, I can see at last,
Goodbye, won't be caught in your trap,
So long, I'm never coming back.

I'm an outcast, under siege attack,
Stand out, you didn't bargain for me,
Wasted, I'm not what you want me to be.

I am an outcast, free at last,
So long, don't need you anyway.
Changes, I am who I am, here to stay.
