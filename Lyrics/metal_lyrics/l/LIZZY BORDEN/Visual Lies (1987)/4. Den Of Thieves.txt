We're the dealers, we'll steal your soul,
Don't get too close, on with the show.
I'm your host here Oblivion, I'm full of sin at your service.

Welcome inside to sights unseen
Visual lies portrayed obscene

In the den of thieves
Watch your eyes, we'll steal your dreams
In the den of thieves
I'll show you things that you won't believe.

She's a harlot, she holds the keys,
She's never free, she's a good time.
What you see is a slice of the knife,
A piece of life in a heartbeat.

Always alive she likes to ride,
Nothing to hide, she's out of sight.

In the den of thieves
Watch your eyes, we'll steal your dreams
In the den of thieves
I'll show you things that you won't believe.

He's an animal carnivorous,
Don't second guess, spreading fear.
In this temple this human zoo
Dreams come true in your worst nightmare

Welcome inside to sights unseen
Visual lies portrayed obscene

In the den of thieves
Watch your eyes, we'll steal your dreams
In the den of thieves
I'll show you things that you won't believe.

In the den of thieves
Watch your eyes, we'll steal your dreams
In the den of thieves
I'll show you things that you won't believe.

You won't believe, you won't believe, in the den of thieves.
