Here comes a candle to light you to bed
Here comes a chopper to chop off your head
No strings attached no lies are told
No bones are broke and no dreams are sold

So blind we can't see
Got no power of will
(yeah love kills)

Love kills all that it touches
Love kills us all
Love kills the life that it clutches
Love takes the fall

Penetrating like cancer it feeds
Parasite sucking like for its needs
Seeping through you with venomous bliss
Until all lie defenseless, a kiss

So numb we can't feel
Malignant never will you heal
(yeah love kills)

Love kills all that it touches
Love kills us all
Love kills the life that it clutches
Love takes the fall

Just when you least expect love
Strikes from behind
Creeping up on you no warning no sign
No turning back when you follow the danger
Never trust a stranger

Love kills all that it touches
Love kills us all
Love kills the life that it clutches
Love takes the fall

Love kills all that it touches
Love kills
Love kills

Here comes a candle to light you to bed
Here comes a chopper to chop off your head
No strings attached no lies are told
No bones are broke and no dreams are sold
