This mission should you decide to accept
Should be met with your full iron force
This tape in five seconds will self destruct
Good luck to you, you're on your own
The powers above and the powers below
Are united complete overthrow
Hear how they lie, accusations fly
The time is now it is at hand

Can you hear
Can you hear the voice of command
Can you hear
Can you hear the voice of command

Soldier the streets there can be no defeat
Don't let nothing stand in our way
They're searching for things that are non-existent
They see what they want
They hear nothing
They are the old we are the new
We can't be bought or sold
We are the chosen we are the few

All see, all hear, none speak, all fear

Operation, detonation, parasites unclean
Fry the tumor that exists unseen
Rise up to power
Released are the damned
No one can refuse our demands

Can you hear
Can you hear the voice of command
Can you hear
Can you hear the voice of command
Can you hear it, can you hear it
The voice of command
I am the voice of command
