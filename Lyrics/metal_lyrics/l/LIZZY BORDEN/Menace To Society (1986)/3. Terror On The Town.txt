Creating havoc on the town
Me and the boys we get around
I pity the city in our way

We love to flirt with death
Race it hard there's no second best
Wild dogs in the street
We run astray

We are terror on the town
Get in the way we'll run you down
We are terror on the town

You look at me you got trouble
I got no cause I'm a frightened rebel
I am the future from the past

We don't care about tomorrow
At dark we romp so reckless ah
No one could ever understand

We are terror on the town
Get in the way we'll run you down
We are terror on the town
We all get around
We are terror on the town
Tonight it's going down
We are terror on the town

We are terror
We are terror
We are terror
We are terror

We are terror on the town
Get in the way we'll run you down
We are terror on the town

We're wrecking havoc in this town
We are the lost that no one found
Here we come round to your about

The taking is all there
Men on the move we love a dare
We are the dead, why should we care

We are terror on the town
Get in the way we'll run you down
We are terror on the town
We all get around
We are terror on the town
Tonight it's going down
We are terror on the town
