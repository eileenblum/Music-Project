Walk through the shadows in the darkness
In search of alien infiltration
Storm through the city swarm like locust
Feed their flesh to the fouls of the air

Parish your thoughts, think what is not
Inflict no sympathy

Brass tactics â get in line
We will march on these themes
Brass tactics â get in line
We will march until we're free

Exterminate the heathen vultures
Before they feed upon our little children
Eyes of fire evil burns
Destroy the threat before it's too late

Parish your thoughts, think what is not
Inflict no sympathy

Brass tactics â get in line
We will march on these themes
Brass tactics â get in line
We will march until we're free

Hear the thunder smash through weakness
Seeking out the youth to force addiction
Only we can make incisions
Right from the start slice out their heart

Brass tactics â get in line
We will march on these themes
Brass tactics â get in line
We will march until we're free
Brass tactics â get in line
We will march on these themes
Brass tactics â get in line
We will march until we're free

Now we're getting down to brass tactics
