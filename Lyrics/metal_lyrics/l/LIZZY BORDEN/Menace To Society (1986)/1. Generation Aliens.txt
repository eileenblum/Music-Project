The naked truth is a blaspheme
Shut your eyes and you won't see
Save us all from  the fate of a harsh reality
The power of seduction
Only leads to more corruption
Decadence induced in youth
From the devil's anarchy

Save us all â From what our eyes behold
Spare us all â From what our ears are told

Show us all, you know the way
Regulate our minds each day
Tell us what we need to know
Lobotomy slow
Give us all you got big brother
We look to you, there is no other
Spell it out â shout it out
We are what you say

Mute us all â from what our lips explode
Brake us all â from what our hands corrode

Generation aliens â we are the Legion of youth
Generation aliens â we are the last fighting few

We are the last â the last fighting few

Generation aliens â we are the Legion of youth
Generation aliens â we are the last fighting few

Society is a mockery
Designed to model majesty
The milasents are in control
And the dissident aren't free
The federation suction
It resulting in mind abduction
Parazootox on the rocks
Confess your treachery

Starve us all â from what we swallow whole
Wash us all â from what our brains unfold

Generation aliens â we are the Legion of youth
Generation aliens â we are the last fighting few
Generation aliens â we are upholding the truth
Generation aliens â we are the exception to rule
Generation
Generation
Generation aliens
