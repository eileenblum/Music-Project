The walls are thin
The voices echo through her silent room
A door slams shut, the shouting follows soon
Those deafening familiar screams

Alcoholic haze
Lipstick trace a place where lights are low
While mother can't pretend she doesn't know
Hearing all the retread lies
Banning all the reasons why

Bloody Mary â can't find her way home
Bloody Mary â can't do what she's told
Bloody Mary â always on hold

Something's going on around here
It's just not clear

Run away
No one cares if you live or why
Lie on your back and watch the virgin die
Daddy's girl is gone forever more
Banging on a stone cold door

Bloody Mary â can't find her way home
Bloody Mary â can't do what she's told
Bloody Mary â always on hold

Something's going on around here
It's just not clear

Razor blades
Cut deep into the wrist of emptiness
In a suicidal rage of attentions missed
No one knew you didn't know yourself
Still no one heard your cry for help

Bloody Mary â can't find her way home
Bloody Mary â can't do what she's told
Bloody Mary â always on hold

Something's going on around here

Bloody Mary â we didn't want you anyway
Bloody Mary â we never know what to say
Bloody Mary â won't you please go away

Something's going on around here
Something's going on around here
Something's going on around here
