I see right through you
As your eyes of stare
Gaze upon me in disgust
Your point of view I'm well aware

Dignified just like the masses
Inside your clone attire
Should we be just like you?
A wild beast they broke and stole your fire

You say that I'm corrupt
I'm infliction pain
But your routine sacrifices
Weigh too heavy on my brain

Outside the breakdown
Is driving home
But with my rebellious nature
I shall not fall

Ah-oh-I'm the menace
Ah-oh-I'm the menace
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-da
To society â to society

You can't make me play your game
I guess we're just not the same
I refuse to pay your debt
No returns and no regrets

Ah-oh-I'm the menace
Ah-oh-I'm the menace
Ah-oh-I'm the menace
Ah-oh-I'm the menace
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-da
To society â to society

You can't make me play your game
I guess we're just not the same
I refuse to pay your debt
No returns and no regrets
