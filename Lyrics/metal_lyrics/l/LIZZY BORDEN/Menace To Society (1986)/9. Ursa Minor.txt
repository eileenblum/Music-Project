Out from the night I hear her
Cry in the dark
Reminding me in trance of who you are
Distorted pictures racing through my head
I look away you vanish into thin air
So far away â so little time the light is on the way
So far away â and still no trace of you
The night will soon be day

Something wicked passing this way comes
I can feel her laughter chill through my bones
How can I wait much longer I feel you here
Revenge is sweetly bitter cold with fear

You disappeared just when I knew you will
And all that's left is I've obsessed this hell

Ursa Minor I just have to find ya
I've been searching all night long
Ursa Minor won't you look behind you
I can't wait too long

Ursa Minor I just have to find ya
I've been searching all night long
Ursa Minor won't you look behind you
I can't wait too long
