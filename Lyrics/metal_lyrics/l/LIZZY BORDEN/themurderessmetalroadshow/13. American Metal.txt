Hearts of stone, skull and crossbones
We band together
The sound of steel, noise you can feel
The smell of leather.

Suspended thighs, blackened cat eyes
We love to shout
The powers in the crowd
Cause we all, we all,  love it loud
We love it loud.

We all need â American Metal
Through in through â American Metal
You've got to bleed â American Metal
Red, White and Blue â American Metal

Hear the thunder, rumble under
It cracks the sky
May the dust never settle
Heavy Metal, will never die

Salute the flag raise up your fist
And scream it out
The powers in the crowd
Cause we all â we all
Love it loud â we love it loud

We all need â American Metal
Through in through â American Metal
You've got to bleed â American Metal
Red, White and Blue â American Metal

We all need â American Metal
Through in through â American Metal
You've got to bleed â American Metal
Red, White and Blue â American Metal
