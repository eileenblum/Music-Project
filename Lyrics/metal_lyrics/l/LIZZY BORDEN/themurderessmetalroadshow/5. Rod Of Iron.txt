Time is not yours
Soon you will find
Back from beyond
He's close behind your every move

I'm not afraid
Following the blind
Leading us to hell
Staying for all time
It's on my head

Savior
Your's is dead
Your's is dead
Your's is dead

The beginning of the end
The destruction of the sin
The darkness shades to light

Screaming out the cries
Of the fire burning inside
The king of kings
Shall rule, with the rod of iron
With the rod of iron

Forever he will burn
Into the lake of fire
Taking him with sorcerers
And liars

False profit
And the beast will die
Together forever, and ever, and ever

The king of kings shall rule
With the rod of iron
With the rod of iron

Never have the power to be free
Never show your mark for us to see
Never again be fooled by your disguise

Screaming out the cries
Of the fire burning inside
The king of kings shall rule with the
With the rod of iron

Never have the power to be free
Never hear your hypnotizing lies

Oh
