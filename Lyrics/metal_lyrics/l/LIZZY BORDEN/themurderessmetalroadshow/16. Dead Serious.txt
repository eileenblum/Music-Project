I know what's going through your mind
You think we'll be together for all time
I'm not just playing with your head
Cause I'm not for sale, but I'm yours to rent

You're over your head
I won't play hide and go seek under the bed

Cause you're dead serious
You're dead serious

Watching me hawk eyes I've been patrolled
Release claws dug so deep let me go
You'd rather see me dead than set me free
You'd lock me up and throw away the key

Green eyes on fire
I won't play misty for your jealous desires

Under the sheets, down below your means
Is where I love to be your only.
Tear down the satins, unveil the lace
But you say-
I couldn't bear another someone's trace

I'd scratch her eyes out of her head
And you would wish that you were dead

You're over your head
I won't play hide and go seek under the bed

Cause you're dead serious
You're dead serious
