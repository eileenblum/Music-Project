I couldn't stop them, they came from afar
They're out to get me,
I knew who they were.
Machine gun blasts send
Shivers up my spine
The kiss of death has marked me for all time

I tried to get away
With no chance for escape
A gang of seven eyes filled with hate

[Chorus:]
They said
No more tomorrows
You're marked with the kiss of death
Ripped out forever
You wear the kiss of death.

I'd never cross you I'd never sell you out
Find the singer who's lies it is
You shout
I am shattered and I'll scream
My last good-bye
Their trigger finger pulls
And the bullets start to fly.

[Chorus]
