Wake up â it's time to die
Wake up â it's time to die

Time is running out on me like tears in the rain
Too painful to live in fear when there's no one left to blame
We're nexus six replicates, superior to man
I think therefore I am, but there's one thing I don't
understand

Alive â why can't I be â if you could see what I've seen
I can't tell if I've been, alive, man or machine

The light that burns twice as bright, burns half half as long
The past is all we have now, we have nothing at all
The present is just a memory, that happened long ago
Like robot machines of the future
Like man old age plagues on

Alive, why can't I be, if you could see what I've seen
I can't tell if I've been, alive, man or machine

Four, five â how to stay alive
Six, seven â go to hell or go to heaven
We need more time, we need more time
Eight, nine â to the devil or divine
Ten, eleven â flesh and blood or steel and oil
We need more time, we need more time

Fiery the angels fell deep thunder
Rode around our shores
Burning with fires of all good
Forever lost in time â enhance

That's the spirit take your aim unless you're alive
You can't play the game and if you don't play
It's not the same, take it from me I'll know
We're nexus six replicates, superior to man
I think therefore I am,
Why only a four year span

Made not to last [x4]

Defection!
