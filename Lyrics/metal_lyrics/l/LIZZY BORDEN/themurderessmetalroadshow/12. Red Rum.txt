All work and no play
Makes Jack a dull boy
I'm driving insane
Cause I need a brand new toy

Killer stalks in search of prey
Sometimes my mind goes astray
The blood flows as my curtain calls
I'm bustin through your walls

All's fair in love and war
Repeated nightmares have begun
Old wounds that never heal
I'll cut them down one by one

Lusting them imaginary
Horrifying coronary
Tormented fools are on the run
Echo there screams Red Rum

Red Rum â in two thirty seven
Red Rum â a drink for your soul

When all the lights go down
And all the lost have been found
Round your neck your turns bound

Red Rum â in two thirty seven
Red Rum â a drink for your soul

Spirits ripping out my mind
Invade my brain with lies they shine
Deja-vu invites intrusion
Murder is the dead conclusion

Red Rum â in two thirty seven
Red Rum â a drink for your soul
Red Rum â come out come out where ever
Red Rum â Hello Daddy's home
