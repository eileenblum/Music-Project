When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did, you know you did, you know you did
And with this ever changing world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

Say, live and let die

What does it matter to you
When you got a job to do
You better do it well
You gotta give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
And with this ever changing world
In which we live in makes you
Give in and cry

Say, live and let die
