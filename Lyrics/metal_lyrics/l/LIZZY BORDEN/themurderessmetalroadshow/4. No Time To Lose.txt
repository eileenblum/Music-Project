Burning red thunder, the spell that you're under
Is a curse of the times
A lover, a leaver, unfaithful deceiver
Your heartache is just in your mind.

Give it up for tonight
Don't even care if it's wrong or right
Lust is too strong to fight
Look to see your blinded sights

I feel your frustrations
I know your relations, you're trapped in a dream
A glass cage around you, but now
That I've found you
I'll shatter it and set you free.

[Chorus:]
We're on the loose â we can't stop time
No time to lose â I'm yours tonight
And you're mine.

Give it up for tonight
Don't even care if its wrong or right
Lust is too strong to fight
Look to see your blinded sights

[Chorus x2]
