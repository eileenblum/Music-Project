Innocence and all you play the role
Pretending you don't want it, well I know
Plead me to stop, I hear your screams
Adrenalin is pumping, you're under attack

[Chorus:]
Give 'em the axe â A demolition blow
Give 'em the axe â You never, never know

I chase you up and down, you like my style
My palms are sweating ah
My body's on fire
I give it to you all down deep inside
I watch you feeding back
You're under attack

You are everything I am
Can't you see it's all the same
It's just a game

Give 'em the axe â A demolition blow
Give 'em the axe â Put 'em up or go

Give 'em the axe â A demolition blow
Give 'em the axe â Tonight will steal the show.
