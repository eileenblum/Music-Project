I growl for my meat
While you bark for the bone
I plunge in so deep
You swallow me whole

You lust for my tongue
I t makes me feel mean
I bound your arms
And lick you clean

Scream at the moon
Crazy as a loon
I feel your heartbeat - you're breathless

You squirm with delight
As you frantically fight
Conceive paradise
Inside the dark

Inside the dark

Flesh eater - she wants it deep, deep, deeper
Flesh eater - I love to eat, eat, eat, eat her

Climbin' the walls
Claws on my back
My cannibal cry
Shrieks out my attack

Your temperature's rising
You're reaching the turn
Convulsions commencing
You'll now start to burn

Flesh eater - she wants it deep, deep, deeper
Flesh eater - I love to eat, eat, eat, eat her
