Right between the eyes
We'll blow 'em all away
Never knowing why, not today

Take 'em by surprise
It's just a game for some
We'll deliver them all to kingdom come

Warfare is all around you
Warfare has tied and bound you
Warfare lay always in your mind

Shoot to kill, ready at will
The plan of attack is survive
No hero's here, just pain and fear
On the battlefield watch 'em die

Warfare is all around you
Warfare has tied and bound you
Warfare lay always in your mind
Warfare will crucify you
Warfare the truth will blind you
Warfare you lose even if you've won

Infiltration, propaganda
Political extravaganza
The laws of war
They're all too clear
Mushroom clouds
The end is near

Warfare is all around you
Warfare has tied and bound you
Warfare lay always in your mind
Warfare will crucify you
Warfare the truth will blind you
Warfare you lose even if you've won
