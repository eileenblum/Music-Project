Through my eyes I watch
As you tried to run
Over you I stand, with my smokin' gun

You can't walk out on me now
I couldn't let you go
If I can't have you
No one will
I see them all through

The eyes
Through the eyes
Of a man

Forever you'll stay safe and sound
Buried deep into the ground
In the back yard sealed real tight
I know you'll never leave me now

Cause I know what's best for you
And now there's nothing you can do
So I think you understand
What I see, I see through the eyes

The eyes
Through the eyes
Of a man

Home sweet home, true colors now are shown
Kicked in the face alone
Through my eyes I watch
As you plead to me
On your knees you cry oh so helplessly
It's all over but the shouting
And all along you knew the reasons
Why I love you to pieces
I see it in your eyes

In your eyes - in your eyes - in your eyes

Home sweet home, true colors now are shown
Kicked in the face alone
