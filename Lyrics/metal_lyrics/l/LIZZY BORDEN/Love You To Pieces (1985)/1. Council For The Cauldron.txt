Spread your wings and fly away with me out for awhile
Light the torch eternal flame will set them all on fire
Come with me now, the blast is for the children
Only their eyes listen, they're the council for the caldron
They're the caldron yeah, they're the chosen
The council for the cauldron

Gathering together on a misty blackened night
Congregation of illusion fill the halls with light
Disciples of disorder, can you hear my call
Cryin' out the passion that will rise and never fall

And never fall

You're the caldron - you're the chosen yeah
You're the caldron yeah

Stirin' up, burnin' up, the heat begins to rise
Now the joiners are uplifting
Growing twice its size
Disciples of disorder, can you hear my call
Cryin' out the passion that will rise and never fall

And never fall

You're the caldron, the council for the caldron yeah
