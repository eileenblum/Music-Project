The strands of hair that
Lay gold beware
The owner's eyes are cruel
Keep your distance fight resistance
Don't you be a fool

Godiva - fear her gold

A strange affair drives
Magnetic stare
A crazy bombshell brain
Can't help myself
Under her spell
Blinded yellow flames

Godiva - fear her gold

Just an illusion inside of my mind
The vision so clear
It's drawing me near
Sucking me, sucking me dry

Release me, you goddess of fire
Unleash me, you temp with desire
The power your hair mystifies
Captures the creatures of light

Godiva - fear her gold
