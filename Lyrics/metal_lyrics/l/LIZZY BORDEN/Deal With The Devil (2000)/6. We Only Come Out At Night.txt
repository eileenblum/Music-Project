We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We're only hiding from tomorrow
We're all of nothing veiled in white
We only steal the blood of sorrow
Living on the shady side of life
Feel the dark the night's begun
The shadows dance with lonely ones
Come my love can you feel the bite
Cause we only come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We are the whispered breath of angels
We are the torture in your dreams
We are the dammed immortal strangers
Out from the shadows hear the screams
You hear the word but you don't know why
We're the ones with the soulless eyes
Come you creatures from the light
Cause we only come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
Feel the dark the night's begun
The shadows dance with lonely ones
Come my love can you feel the bite
Cause we only come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
We only... come out at night
