Flesh of my flesh, desire, scandalous
You're all these things my love
And still I can possess
You crush my heart with eyes that cry a tear
You cast your spell on me
By dark I want you near
Lovin' you is murder
I'm hot and you're cold I don't want you no more
Lovin' you is murder
My love's in your hands in your world
I bring you black roses you never ever call
Cause without love there can be nothing after all
The rest is silence when I hear you speak my name
Wheels and wheels they turn
And you never stay the same
Lovin' you is murder
You drive me insane, I don't want you no more
Lovin' you is murder
You turn me away when I crawl through your door
Lovin' you is murder
You kick me around and I come back for more
Lovin' you is murder
My love's in your hands in your world
Lovin' you is murder
I'm hot and you're cold I don't want you no more
Lovin' you is murder
I'm young and I'm old I can't take anymore
Lovin' you is murder
My love's in my hands in my world
