The streets are paved with savage dust
They torture love come cum they must
Feel the night with the smell of lust
Intoxicates the air
Feel your flesh it makes me whole
It makes me cold your love I stole
The one you hold you'll never know
She sold her soul beware
There all out there now, I'll take you there
There out on the move, ga, ga, god knows where
The dirty girls all bent on pleasure
Extort the greedy sex offenders
Creature comforts never end her
Lust for life for love
The sinful ways of wickedness
Alluring power of decadence
Never lonely loneliness
The affair is never fair
The lights glow far from star to star in Zanzibar
The calling card, your love is hard in Zanzibar
One look one touch, a touch too much in Zanzibar
The fantasy seems real to me in Zanzibar
