[Japanese Bonus Track]
[Scorpions cover]

I'm in love with the sunshine
I'm in love with the falling rain
Everything seems to call your name
Yesterday you were leaving
Leaving life and all the pain
Everything wants you back again.

I've found myself through you
And there was love in my life
I felt always naturally high and my love had a home
But now my mind has started to roam
You're my life giving fire and you carried all my love
Through you I was so inspired
You're engraved deep in my heart

My dreams recall us being one
I've searched for you to be free
My force of life you have always been
I Feel blue since you've gone
Your breath of love surrounded me
When can I rejoin you to be free

Wait, can this be a dream
There is a voice in my head
It belongs to you, it says
Don't cry, no need to be sad
There's a way to stay with you again
It's more than you ever had
And no death brings us apart
Our timeless love always grows
Because you are in my other heart

I know we've never been apart
your love sets fire to my heart
We'll burn the sky
When it's time for me to die
We'll burn the sky...
