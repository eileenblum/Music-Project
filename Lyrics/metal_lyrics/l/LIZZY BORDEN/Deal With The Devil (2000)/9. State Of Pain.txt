You see the good in me, I like the bad in you
You see it's so easy to be believed
I need you won't you come, I'm never gonna go
You see it's so easy to be deceived
So here we are, we've come so far
Got lost along the way
Don't you know we're living in a state of pain
You like my wicked ways, forbidden kiss of pain
It's dark and strange, tied up all night
We're on the beaten path, tangled up in life
Love hates the game no rules apply
So here we are, we've gone too far
We've passed the place to stay
Don't you know we've living in a state of pain
Can't hear the whispering to clear
Can't stop screaming in my ear
Bit by bit you we're turning the screws
You never knew me, I never knew you
Inch by inch we unraveled the clues
We gotta lose, you know we're livin' in a state of pain
So here we are, stoned and starved
We just wanted to play
So here we are so desperately
So here we are, we've gone this far
The dog will his day
Don't you know we're livin' in a state of pain
