In you I trust this moment of truth is lost in us
I know about you, do you know about me
The guilty never sleeps, the power of love is jealousy
I'm black and blue you fed me to the lies
I'm praying but nothing seems to change
I'm praying and I know who's the same
I'm studying to become somebody else
When I look at you I see myself
I'm so mixed up, I'm out of luck, my god
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in you
I can't fight my moment of doubt
I wanna believe in you, I can't see deceit in you
I can't see the truth through the lies
Confession, I told you all my secret obsessions
Now I need you even more
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in you
I know you won't let me down
I wanna believe in you, I get confused am I through
Trusting you to be around
And even after midnight I can feel you fade away
Oh my love is strong, my faith has gone astray
And even when you're not here, I fall down and I pray
And even after midnight I can feel you slip away
All your love is gone, my soul has lost the way
And even when you're not here, I still want you anyway
I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe in you
I know you won't let me down
I wanna believe in you, I get confused am I through
Trusting you to be around
