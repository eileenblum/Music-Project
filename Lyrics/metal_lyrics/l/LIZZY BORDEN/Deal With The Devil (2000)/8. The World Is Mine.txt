I think I'm radioactive, gentlemen prefer bombs
Holy smoker in the black chair
Setting of the smoke alarm
There's a killer down in Detroit
He had no face but left a name
Call me god just like you mean it
Cause now the world is mine to blame

[Chorus:]
The world is mine, the world is mine
The world is my world, the world is my world
The world is mine, this is my world

Dark places in a dark heart
And now it's pouring acid rain
I'll take a sentimental journey across my wrist to leaky veins
Well I can take you I can make you
You know it's down to us or them
Call me god this time you mean it
Cause I'm rising up again
Sex for sacrilegious priests, hypocritical Jesus freaks
I'm an angel's son with a loaded gun
I'm on a mission of mercy
I'm a killer, I'm a gun for hire
You're a sinner
And I'm the god of hell fire

[Chorus]

Call me god, I'm the lord
You call me god, cause it's my world
