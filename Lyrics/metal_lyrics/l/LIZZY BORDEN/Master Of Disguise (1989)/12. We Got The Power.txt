Well the villain is the hero, and I'm torn, dirty and mod
I've gone from scorn to sensation, cause I'm great at being bad
I got the world in the palm of my hand

I break out the beast and make 'em understand
Never turn it down, shout it out loud

And I'm feeling strong, I can take it
Yeah I'm feeling strong, we can make it through

So turn it on, we got the power
Turn it up, we got the power

We own the night, if you follow my lead
Hide in plain sight, we'll make the suckers bleed
Never turn it down, shout it out loud

And I'm feeling strong, I can take it
Yeah I'm feeling strong, we can make it through

So turn it on,
We got the power
Turn it up, we got the power
