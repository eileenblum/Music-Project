In this theatre of cruelty
I'm the living page of mystery
No turning back I'm inside your head
Time to roll over and play dead

Cut to the chase scene the hero's amazing
Degenerate millionare filthy rich crazy

Sinners and cowards and hypocrites creedless
Powerless lost, double crossed
Here to eat us alive

We can survive, they can't make us they won't break our stride
We can survive never lay down and die

Roll over, roll over
Roll over and play dead (I said)
Roll over, roll over
Roll over and play dead

Sluts are your lovers, the streets are their haven
Their dreams all died hard when their pumps hit the pavement

Comas and golddust and promises, promises
Whitecoats and cutthroats they lied
No place to hide

We can survive, we can fake it they can't take our pride
we can survive, never lay down and die

Roll over, roll over
Roll over and play dead
Roll over, roll over
Roll over and play dead
