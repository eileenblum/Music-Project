Lies in the pouring rain
I taste who you are
A stranger with life to bleed
I'm bleeding you dry

Cry out the unspoken
The devil's in disguise
Life flows into my veins
From angels in your eyes

Sins of the flesh
Lust in my breath
No one must ever know
I own your soul

Tears in the sunlit sky
I know what you dream
There's one hope for you and I
I am what I seem

Cry out the unspoken
The devil's in disguise
Life flows into my veins
From angels in your eyes

Sins of the flesh
Lust in my breath
No one must ever know
I own your soul
Sins of the flesh
Innocence blessed
Trust me you're not alone
Anymore

Cry out the unspoken
The devil's in your eyes
Life flows into my veins
From angels in disguise

Sins of the flesh
Lust in my breath
No one must ever know
I own your soul
Sins of the flesh
Innocence blessed
Trust me you're not alone
Anymore

Sins of the flesh (Sins of the flesh)
Lust in my breath (Lust in my breath)
No one must ever know (No one must ever know)
I own your soul
Sins of the flesh (Sins of the flesh)
Innocence blessed (Innocence blessed)
Trust me you're not alone (Trust me you're not alone)
Anymore
