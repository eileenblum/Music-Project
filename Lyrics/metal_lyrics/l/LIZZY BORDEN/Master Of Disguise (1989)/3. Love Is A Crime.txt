I call she says
I know you're there
I can hear you breathing
It's you again
I know it's wrong
My time is gone
I can feel your touch
Right through the phone

I got your number from the TV screen
Said if you're lonely just give me a call
Cause I'm only a hotline away
We got the girls so hot and sweet
The cherry filled here your talk is cheap
We'll bring your lonely nights to life

I feel your fingers touching me
Through my line
You seem to say all the right things
In time

Love is a crime
It's stealing my soul and my mind
Love is a crime
You get what you get love is blind

Love is a crime
It's stealing my soul and my mind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
You get what you get love is blind

They say I can't love girls like you
But what do they know
Leave that trash alone
I know you're more than just a voice on the phone

Your words they leave nothing to hide
On my line
I need to hear your voice inside
My line

Love is a crime
It's stealing control of my mind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
You want and you watch you can't find
Love is a crime
Love gives on the take from behind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
Behind the line she's all mine

Love is a love is a love is a love is a crime
Love is a crime
Love is a crime
Love is a crime
