My eyes see inside myself
Look away look away look away
The sky is black and so is my heart
I'm afraid I am pain I am death

I'll be your fool
I am your slave
But one false move and you're blown away

Action speaks I will die for you
In the end I pretend I was cruel
You're all inside me don't try and hide me
Cause I am you and you are begging me to stay

I'll be your bad guy
I will portray
But one false move and you're blown away
