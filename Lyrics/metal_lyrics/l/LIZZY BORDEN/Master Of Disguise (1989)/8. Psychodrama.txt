I could make you believe, I could make you feel
I could be any one I want to be, it seems so real

What do you want to see, the villain is black
What do you want from me, to deceive
I'll fill your eyes with broken dreams

It's a psychodrama, caught in a web of mystery
Psychodrama, this is the place where my eyes can

Feel the pain they inflict on me
I'm a killer at large, on your movie screen

What do you want to be, the hero in white
What do you want from me, to believe
I'll fill your eyes with shattered schemes

It's a psychodrama, caught in a web of mystery
Psychodrama, there's no escape from what you see
Psychodrama, trapped in my world deceptively
Psychodrama, come inside with me, come inside and see my world

It's a psychodrama, caught in a web of mystery
Psychodrama, there's no escape from what you see
Psychodrama, no matter what you pretend to be
Psychodrama, in the theatre of cruelty
Psychodrama, you'll lose your mind, insanity
Psychodrama, in this land of obscurity
