Please don't stand in my way
I can't play this game no more
I don't see things your way
And I know one thing for sure

I won't give up a little sadness
I need to fill my life with madness

Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye

Please don't stand in my light
I've got time to pay tonight
You know I've stayed too long
I must seize the day before the day's long gone

I won't give up a little sadness
I need to fill my life with madness

Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Say goodbye

So here I am
Don't misunderstand
So here I am
I've got no plans
But I'm alive

Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Never too young to die (To die)
Never too young to say goodbye (To say goodbye)

Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye (To say goodbye)
Never too young to die (To die)
Never too young to say goodbye (To say goodbye)
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
