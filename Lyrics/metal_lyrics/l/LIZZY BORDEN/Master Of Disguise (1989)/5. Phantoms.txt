When the moon is full
And the hounds of hell
Are howling in the night
And the church bell gives an angry yell
There's a screech of pain
Under a broken back street light
I feel her sweet pain
When there's phantoms in the night

Strangers in the night
In the darkness there
Hiding in the unlit
I know she's here I know she's here
Lovers at first sight
But I've never seen her face
She comes the stroke of midnight
To pray lay my soul to waste

She keeps calling my name
I can feel her near
She keeps calling my name
I can feel her stare

Strangers in the night
A softly whisper stare
The smell of sweet perfume
Scent in the air with lust and care
She comes for what she needs
She is my wildest dream
Sad wings against my body brush
I am her human touch

She keeps calling my name
I can feel her near
I keep hearing my name
Whispered breathless

Phantoms
Come save me a dream
Phantoms of the night
Phantoms
Come stay with me (Stay with me)
Phantoms of the night

She keeps calling my name
I can feel her near
I keep hearing my name
Whispered breathless

Phantoms
Come save me a dream
Phantoms of the night
Phantoms
Come stay with me (Stay with me)
Phantoms of the night

Phantoms
Come save me a dream (Come on and save me a dream)
Phantoms of the night (Of the night of the night)
Phantoms
Come stay with me (Stay with me)(Come on and stay with me)
Phantoms of the night
