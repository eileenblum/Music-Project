Trick of the light
All your life
FLash before your eyes
Can you run away?
Sleeping with the Devil
You had the choice to choose
The godness and the badness
And the dying subterfuge
Sucking off the sinner
Swallow what you will
Spitting out the demon seed
Open your gates of hell

Come into the light
Step into the light
Welcome to the kingdom of the dead
Come into the light
Walk into the dark light
Welcome to the kingdom of dead

Angel of Death
Darker side
The touch of your flesh
Eat you alive
Time to meet your maker
It's your life to lose
I'm your soul collector
And we have a rendezvous
I'll guide your  through  the heaven
Escort you through the hell
Cause I'm the reaper man
And man you'll never live to hell

Come into the light
Step into the light
Welcome to the kingdom of the dead
Come into the light
Walk into the dark light
Welcome to the kingdom of dead
