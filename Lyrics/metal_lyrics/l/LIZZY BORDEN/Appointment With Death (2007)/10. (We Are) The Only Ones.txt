Rise Look around you
Children of the night you are home
Stand and be counted
One for all and we are one
We are the only ones
Scream Swear on your soul
Dying to be reborn again
Fight Revolution
Live forever us vs them
We are the only ones
Ride Now I told you
Children of the night you are home
Stand and be counted
One for all and all we are one
We are the only ones who know
