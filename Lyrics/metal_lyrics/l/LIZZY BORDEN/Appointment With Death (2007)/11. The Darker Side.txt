Why do you love me?
You're a victim and I just want your heart
Why do you hate me?
As far as I can see we're lost in the dark
You keep your distance
A collision course will devour our lives
Vicious circle, poisonous whishes
Love's hate in disguise
Paint my white horse black
Cause I'm going back
We're on the darker side of love
Why do I want you?
You're all I ever needed
It's never enough
Why do you need me?
All you ever want is
What I haven't got
Would you die for me?
If I was you
We're on the darker side of love
I can't find a way out
And I don't know
It's beyond my control
We're on the darker side of love
