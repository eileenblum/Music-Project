In the dark where you feel connected....
Hide away from they you were rejected....
Crumbling walls in there you wonât survive....
When I touch you where you hurt....
While I skin you alive....

I wanna crawl down under your skin....
I wanna go where no oneâs ever been....
I wanna crawl down under your skin....
I wanna Strip away the pain....

Look at you, youâre sick and self infected....
Ainât got a clue of who you see reflected....
Empty eyes of vacant suffocating....
Drowning in your vanity youâre disintegrating....

Who you are is what I wanna be....
So bizarre so insane....
Where you are is where I wanna be....
How we are is all in vain....

I wanna crawl down under your skin....
I wanna get to where Iâve never been....
I wanna crawl down under your skin....
I wanna lick away the pain....
Now we are all the same....

Now we are all the pain....
