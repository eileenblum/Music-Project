Live forever the end of never
Everywhere and no where
Come tomorrow
Your greedy sorrows disappears
Too much of nothinâ
Not enough of somethinâ
Dying for something more
Too much to dream for
Just wanna scream
Goodbye before
Tomorrow never comes
Weâre living for tonight
Tomorrow never comes
We only have tonight
Tomorrow never comes, it never comes
Do you know me?
Iâm what you donât see
Unwanted, unwelcome
The dark forbidden
Is where Iâm hidden
Your own phantom
Love to Love you
Been thinkinâ of you
Nothings is what nothing was
The death of love brings
Your new beginnings
Your own anthem
Tomorrow never comes
Weâre living for tonight
Tomorrow never comes
Tonight we rule the night
Tomorrow never comes
The kiss of death for life
Tomorrow never comes
Our Love a last goodbye
Tomorrow never comes, it never comes
