Love is only  eternal haunting
Eat the hurt the ache the numb
The loveless owner is perversely welcome

If this my only sacrifice
Too much to lose, too high the price
You and I never say goodbye
I will remember you, it's alright
You and I are never gonna die
I will wherever with you, it's alright
The death of love

Love is only screaming backwards
A broken dreamer falling forward
Forgive means nothing, forgetting never
Love has a cold death grip on forever

If this my only sacrifice
Too much to lose, too high the price
You and I are never say goodbye
I will remember you, it's alright
You and I are never gonna die
I will wherever with you
It's alright, We're alright
The death of love

If this my only sacrifice
Too much to lose, too high the price
You and I are never say goodbye
I will remember you
It's alright
You don't cry we're never gonna die
I am forever with you
We're alright
The death of love
