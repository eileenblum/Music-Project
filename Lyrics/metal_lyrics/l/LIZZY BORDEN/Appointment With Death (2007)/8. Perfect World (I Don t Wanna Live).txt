A view from the roof
Childproof
Pearls of slumber
Diamonds glitter
My death waits
Anticipates
One last breath before I go order
The drink is slow, in my car
Idol death, a suicide star
Now give me speed so I can leave
Down the path of no tomorrows

I don't wanna live in a perfect world
I can never live in a perfect world

Name your poison
Overdose
Deadly venom
Injected within
Stop this train
Too much the same
One last look before I jump over
The world is dark, in my scream
Wide awake in my dreams
The last embrace
No longer chased
One last whisper goodbye

I don't wanna live in a perfect world
I can never live in a perfect world

I don't wanna live, don't wanna live, don't wanna live
In a perfect world
I can never live, can never live, can never live
In a perfect world
