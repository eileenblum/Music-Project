Rotting bones rise Dead man thrones
With only stones to say Exhume the corpse lie
Sacred ground Believe
I've found the way
Cry to the true lunatic
Who reign on your parade
Ride your stolen crucifix
Bow down and pray for plague
Can you feel the rage bleed from my eyes?
Flooding all of your pain hurt you when i cry
When you see the rain falling from the sky
Then you'll know the rage bleeding from my eyes
Bloody tears Secret death spies
Sold for the soulless
Shrapnel from the paid
Scorched by God and made with love
For you a live grenade
Cry of the true heretic
Who take your breath away
Death will live in infamy
Unholy rollers pray
Can you feel the rage bleeding from my eyes?
Drowning all of your pain hurt you when I cry
When you see the rain falling from the sky
Then you'll know the rage bleeding from my eyes
Rotting bones rise
Secret death spies
On the dark side
Now we all die
Bloody tears
