I'm on the inside looking through
The Mask of Death we both knew
The time would come for us to choose
To run away from it all
I wanna fall asleep tonight
Beware away into the night
I won't look away
I can't watch go out the light
I will be forever
Meet you on the other side
We're in this thing together
I'm on the outside break 'n' free
Now I have immortality
This is the end of destiny
Come run away from it all
You're gonna fall asleep tonight
All Alone and dressed in white
And for the dead the candle light
Burns the night away
Wicked schemes come out at night
Blinding  us together
Meet you on the other side
Kiss to kill surrender
Can you feel the darkness grow?
The rush the black the never
Only those who o one knows
Are lost and gone forever
Forever, forever
We're gonna fall asleep tonight
Time has come for us to run
We will die alone tonight
By poison and by dagger
It is  the death of love that remember this
Forget me not, no never
This will be love tragedy
The two of us whoever
Meet you on the other side
Where we will live forever
Forever, forever
