When I had to kill
For the first time
And most of them just went away
I fell into your arms
My sweet-lipped goddess of indifference

Memories were leaving me
One by one
Slowly dying out
A few of them
Like the stones
Stuck on a battlefield in silent cry

The wind was blowing
And the song that he sang to me
Was so beautiful and so fragile
All I have left alive
Was crying out my name
Wanting me to come back

When I had to kill
For the second time
And all of them just went away
I got up from my knees
And became a man
Standing over the boy's grave

Shadows were trying to get inside
While the vultures were circling in the air
The dust has settled
And the field
Uncovered part of me
I couldn't recognize

I'm learning to live
With phantom pain
Trying to get used to the brighter light
I'm taming the ache
New scars on my face
The days when everything inside of me collapsed

Dreams that have gone
And my weaknesses
Hounded and scared
Rebuilt their barricades
On my battlefield
They got a second chance
Feeding on my remorse
Dwelling on the past

The fiery red cracks in the sky
What has gone to pieces will not take hold of me
Standing upright
With open eyes
When tears have turned to fists
Feel my time has come

And the broken hearts will not break through my mind
And the broken hearts will not break through my mind
And the broken hearts will not break through my mind
And the broken hearts will not break through my mind
