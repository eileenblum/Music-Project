I want to tell you about something
You don't talk to me anymore
Want to share my innermost desires
You don't talk to me anymore

I need to show you what I'm like
What I've achieved
What I have understood
Then you might tell me you are proud of me

But you don't talk to me anymore
I want to show you my words on paper
But you don't talk to me anymore
Just want to say that I am sorry
But you don't talk to me anymore

I need to show you what I'm like
What I've achieved
What I have understood
Then you might tell me you're proud of me

But you don't talk to me anymore
