Sleep on tight
My little girl
Please do not wake up
I am selfish
For I need
Something from your dream
A little patch
That will cool me down

There's no land of unicorns
And no rainbow stars
You are growing up so fast
But you still believe and fly so high
Without falling down

Stay with me now
All my dormant fears are coming
Back to my mind
It seems that you're the only one who can
Help my heart get through the pain

And the sound
Like far-off drums
Hammers in my head
I can hear them getting ready
I know they're coming for
What's left of my soul

Let me steal a part of your
Childish innocence
Let me sit down by your side
Pull myself together
And deny
That I'm falling apart

Stay with me now
All my dormant fears are coming
Back to my mind
It seems that you're the only one who can
Help my heart get through the pain

Sleep on tight
My little girl
Please do not wake up
I am selfish
For I need
Something from your dream
A little patch
That will cool me down

You came to my gloomy world
Lightened up my sky
Thanks to you I've realized
What I am still afraid of
I'm afraid for you

Stay with me now
All my dormant fears are coming
Back to my mind
It seems that you're the only one who can
Help my heart get through the pain
