Don't look down
Don't hesitate now
Just so you now
There's no return

Halfway across
High above the fractured city and life
Soon it will all be over
But you have to move forward

Don't look up
Don't daydream too much
Just so you know
There will be blood
Even if you stay neutral

No matter how hard you try
To shut down you your feverish thoughts
They hunt you down with no regret
Cause you have to fix it all

So you did fairly well with the goals you set for your pride
And even though you're like a tightrope walker with a fear of heights
And your legs wobble and your arms helplessly flail around
You strive to maintain the highest level of not giving up

But no matter how hard you try
To shout down your feverish thoughts
They hunt you down with no regret
Cause you have to fix it
You have to fix it all

Every day
Every night
We walk the line
Trying not to fall

Every day
Every night
We're getting close
Then we lose control

We rise
We shine
Then we fall down
In love with the moon
Waiting for the sun

Every day
Every night
We walk the line
Trying not to fall

Every day
Every night
We're getting close
Then we lose control

With shattered minds
With broken hearts
In love with the moon
Waiting for the sun

For the sun we are waiting for the sun we are waiting
For the sun we are waiting for
