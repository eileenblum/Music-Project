We
Have
Taken our world apart

Lost our faith
Sealed inside the plastic life

Intimidated and resigned
We wait

Turned away from each other

We failed
For we did nothing about us

Promises
Empty
And full of lies

I have a chance to save my last
Shreds of time

Follow my instinct
I'm not afraid to try

Done with your failures
You blame me for

I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
