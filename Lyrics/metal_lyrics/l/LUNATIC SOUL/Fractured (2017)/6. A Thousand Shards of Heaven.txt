You can say that I belong to
All the moments
That I couldn't let
Sink into my oblivion
You can say that I'm yearning
For something that's already gone
But I'm not a prisoner

I want to feel what it's like
When sorrow turns into strength
I want to feel what it's like
When there's no screeches in my head

You can say that I'm chasing
Something that is unattainable
So you know my way to survive
You can say that I'm surrounded
By the ruins of my previous life
But I am not a prisoner

I want to feel what it's like
When sorrow turns into strength
I want to feel what it's like
When there's no screeches in my head
I want to feel what it's like
When dreams of mine don't leave a mark
On my battered heart

You can say that I belong to
All the moments
That I couldn't let
Sink into my oblivion
You can say that I am yearning
For something that's already gone
But I am not a prisoner

I want to feel what it's like
When sorrow turns into strength
I want to feel what it's like
When there's no screeches in my head
I want to feel what it's like
When dreams of mine don't leave a mark
I want to feel what it's like
When what I lost comes back to life
To heal my battered heart

A thousand shards of heaven
Staring at the stars

A thousand shards of heaven
Drinking coldness from the night

I collect my story
Under the fragmented sky
Traveling through my wasteland
Praying for the rain to come

I need your every tear to save my life
I need your every tear to save my life
