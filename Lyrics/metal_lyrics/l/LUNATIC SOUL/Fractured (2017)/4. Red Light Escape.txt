I'm locked in a room with no escape
No description key
No clue how to begin
The countdown clock is on the wall
4 red digits have invaded my soul

Soothe the pain
My body hurts
Just take away
What lies within
Help to forget
Unlock my true addiction
Set me free

Borderline is crossed again
I can get beyond myself
Two years of sobriety
I know I gave up
But I have to feel

Just put me to the test
It's time to play our game

Soothe the pain
My body hurts
Just take away
What lies within
Help to forget
Unlock my true addiction
Set me free
Borderline is crossed again
I go beyond myself

Just put me to the test
It's time to play our game
