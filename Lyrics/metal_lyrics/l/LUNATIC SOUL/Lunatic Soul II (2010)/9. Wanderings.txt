I am walking
Through the valley of the shadow of your name
It's been another after-life-time
Since you left me here this way
How about a little game of chess
How about we roll the dice
What can I do
Where should I go now
I want to look into your eyes

Drifting in the state of limbo
Condemned to idleness
Listen to the sound of distant memories
Passing through the white hourglass

Just wandering around

Looking for the way to my home
I've lived someone else's life
Waiting for the perfect moment
I've lost all track of time

What can I do
Where should I go now
I want to look into your eyes
Listen to the sound of distant memories
Passing through the white hourglass

In the middle of light and darkness, in the middle of light and shade

I was trying to avoid your kiss, I was trying to escape

Now I'm the soul
Banished to everlasting wanderings

Thanks to edgecrush3r for correcting track #9 lyrics.
