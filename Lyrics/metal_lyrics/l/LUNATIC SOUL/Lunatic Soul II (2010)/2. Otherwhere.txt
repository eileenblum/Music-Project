I am becoming
In the realm of unknown
Beyond unending
Time
Space
And form

I was buried for rebirth
Casting off the old
Born into the spirit
From within I come

Escape from sorrow
No beginning
No end
Return to whiteness
The new loneliness

I was buried for rebirth
Casting off the old
Born into the spirit
From within I come
