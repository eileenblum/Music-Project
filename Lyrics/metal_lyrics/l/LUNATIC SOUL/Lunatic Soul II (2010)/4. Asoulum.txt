I can't move
Belts are too tight
Four bare white walls
Garish light
Awake!

Welcome to my travel berth
It's about time
To cleanse all those hurts
And return

I won't go
Cause I'm in the soul asylum
I can't go
Cause I'm in the soul asylum
I can't move on
Cause I'm stuck in the soul asylum

Please don't erase my name again

Something appears next to me
I follow it
I am led to the edge of bright

I watch as this place starts to change
It takes on all kinds of different shapes
Twisted screaming faces lash out from the walls
Fear permeates through my soul
I hear the moaning
Voices from my past
I'm sinking in the sea of returning cries
For good

I won't go
Cause I'm in the soul asylum
I can't go
Cause I'm in the soul asylum
I can't move on
Cause I'm stuck in the soul asylum

Please don't erase my name again
Not again
