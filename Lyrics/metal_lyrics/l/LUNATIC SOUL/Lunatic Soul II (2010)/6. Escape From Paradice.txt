Thought I was healed
Cause I felt something different
When you took me above
To this place
Your pride
The Ice Palace stood
On the top of the mountain
You said
There are bars in the windows
But a great view outside

Help me
Help me end my lie
Cause I know I will not take it anymore
Help me
Help me end my lie
I've got a fear of heights
In this perfect world

It's time to fall
