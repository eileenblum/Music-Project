[a) This Heaven]

Soon after the awakening
I flew up in the air
I was a snowflake floating
Through my heavenland
As light as a feather
An ash
Like a grain of sand
From the white desert
And the misplaced time
I really need to find

I was a drop of water
From the pool of life
Since my burden's gone
I am the calm inside
This heaven makes me light

[b) Don't Feel Alive]

The sudden flashback stirs in my head
I see the boat
I see the ferryman
Recall my choice
Recall the words he said
So where the heaven am I now?
Where the heaven am I?

I don't feel alive
I don't feel alive
I feel nothing

My lips are tightly sealed
My mind is blank
And every part of me is paralyzed
The scattered bits of my consciousness
Are suspended in the whiteness
Another stage of my path

I don't feel alive
I don't feel alive
I feel nothing
