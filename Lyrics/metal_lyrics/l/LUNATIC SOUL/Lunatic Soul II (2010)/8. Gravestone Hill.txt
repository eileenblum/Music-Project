When they met after years
One day
They went to the hill
Where the old gravestone stood in the shade
Lonely
Admiring the city lights
They started a new life
Their love was reborn

The old gravestone
Forgotten by time
Remained in the shade

Winter came earlier
Than last year when they moved on
They returned
The whole family
Happy with memories and snow
Children were sledding
So joyful
They looked at them
Smiling
Embraced with love

The old gravestone
Forgotten by time
Remained in the shade
Alone
