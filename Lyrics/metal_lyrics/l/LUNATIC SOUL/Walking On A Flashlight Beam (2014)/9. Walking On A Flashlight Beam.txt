Silence
How long am I here?
No sorrow
Maybe just one tear
Frozen
Somewhere in my heart
I close my eyes
Please don't wake me up

All my nights
I lived behind the pane of glass
With my stars sellotaped
Above inside
In the midst of that
I've been searching for you
Walking on a light
On a man-made moon

I now float into
The darkest realm within
Where time never ends
It sleeps in the field of the evermore
Between different spaces
I dream where I belong
The time will never end
And I will not fear the falling anymore

All my nights
I lived behind the pane of glass
With my stars sellotaped
Above inside
In the midst of that
I've been searching for you
Walking on a light
On a man-made moon

I now float into
The darkest realm within
Where time never ends
It sleeps in the field of the evermore
Between different spaces
I dream where I belong
The time will never end
And I will not fear the falling anymore

Walking on a flashlight beam.
Walking on a flashlight beam.
