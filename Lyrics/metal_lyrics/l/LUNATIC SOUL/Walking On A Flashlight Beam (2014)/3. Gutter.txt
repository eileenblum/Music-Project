They crawl out from the dark
Permeate through my door
Float in the hallway
Slowly blend into the walls

In the shadow of my grief
I can hear whispered sounds
Feel a cold breath on my skin
Here they come
To assert their rights

The fear is what I need, what I need to believe
The fear is what I need, what I need to feel

And so I dragged myself
Into this gutter of mine
Where shades of prey
Feed on my soul

I crave to commit my words
To the book of stifled cries
I fell down so long ago
I don't remember now

The fear is what I need, what I need to believe
The fear is what I need, what I need to feel

And so I dragged myself
Into this gutter of mine
Where shades of prey
Feed on my soul
