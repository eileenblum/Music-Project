So maybe I shine by reflecting light
And in the world of fiction I've settled in
Condemned myself to solitude

Light and dark
My home
Despair
Laughter and tears
My voice and your touch

So maybe I'm damaged beyond repair
Asleep in my ivory-cage with shutters down
But I retrieved my dreams of us

Light and dark
My home
Despair
Laughter and tears
My voice and your touch

***

Embraced by distorted clouds
My lucid nightmare is back again
First waves of the rising tide
I run away from the flood of bile and filth
I reach out my hands to you
But I drown in the murk with my silent scream
Suddenly!
Suddenly!
