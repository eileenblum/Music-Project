I deface
All the dreams that followed
And deformed my mind
When I fell into your heaven

Now I bend the spoons
As I bend the reality
I warp the truth
As I warp the time inside my head

I deface
All the dreams that followed
And deformed my mind
When I fell into your heaven

Now I bend the spoons
As I bend the reality
I warp the truth
As I warp the time inside my head

Can you hear
All is quiet
It feels all right
I guess I fell into your heaven
