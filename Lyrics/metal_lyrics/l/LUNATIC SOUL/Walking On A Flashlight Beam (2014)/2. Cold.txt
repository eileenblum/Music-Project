Cold illucid world outside
Dim, amorphous silhouettes of hope
Trying to retain their shades
By praying to the sun

I press my face against the pane
Stuck inside a container called myself
Watching all these blurry faces yearning to be sharp
Hiding from the sobbing noise
And resounding laughs

But there's something beyond that draws me in
I abandon my shelter when the crowd thins out
I go there when the warm night falls
Stay behind the yellow line
Insecure

Maybe one night
I dare to forget
I dare to try
I know you are waiting
Somewhere at the edge of us

There's something beyond that draws me in
There's something beyond that draws me in
