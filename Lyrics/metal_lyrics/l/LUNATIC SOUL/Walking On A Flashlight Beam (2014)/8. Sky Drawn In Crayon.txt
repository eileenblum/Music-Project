Finally
I feel calm
Anxiety disappeared
There's no pain at all

Finally
It went away
There is no regret
I know
I understand

I can breathe
A sigh of relief
I accept the end of my
Closed reality

I need a sky
Innocent sky
I feel like I left
My shell behind

The room full of light
Is tidied up
I drew back the curtains
And removed all my doubts

I need a sky
My moonlight and my sunset
Drawn with a trusting childlike smile
