He sets off on this journey
Filled with hope and love

Unaware of what lies ahead
He marches with integrity
Towards the orbis alia
Smells of rotten corpses
And decayed membrane on the blooded field

He spots a trail of splattered blood
So he follows it leads him
To the cyclops destroying them legions

One by one this leviathan hammers
Decapitates consumes the bodies of
These wretched creatures
And uses the bodies to skiver the bodies

This devastation stands
Between him and his goal he must come up
With a scheme to pass by disregarded

Random thoughts here and there
He convinces himself that the
Only way to accomplish this is
Is to skin the dead
And sew himself a bodysuit

I shall create the most grotesque looking livery

None should recognize the mistresses slave

Sneaking around he goes picking
Up different pieces of skin
Sewing himself the perfect bodysuit
To trick and mislead his foes

He is pleased with his suit he puts it on
Blood flowing down his face
He grins and proceeds
