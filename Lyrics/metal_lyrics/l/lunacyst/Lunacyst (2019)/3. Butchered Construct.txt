Disturbed agonized heavyhearted and depressed soul

He glares at the dusk and wishes he was a fucking decayed cadaver

He hearkens a hushed tone
They plant thoughts in his fucking head
Telling him to shape the most god like carcass

Working like a crazed butcher
He hacks, grinds, plasma and bones
Working in his own solitary
Confinement with bodies and blood

Die

Acts of insanity are being emerged
He rips the flesh and decapitates the body parts

Not knowing he's being deceived

By this rotten incorporeal being
He composes this abomination
