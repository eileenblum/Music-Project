Strutting across this other world
Raped I am not but minions defiling each other

Strange this place is
I hear voices
They call my name
I sense it's aura
I fellow these hellish cries
Slowly and slowly they pierce my brain

Out of breath I am
My body dehydrated

My bladder infected with bacteria
My urine filled with dried cum and blood

The sewed skin smells like decaying vaginal yeast
Overall I am a fucking grotesque legion

Closer and closer I get to the book I feel it

It calls to me
I pass the river

Find a heretic who guides
Me where the book be settles

Further and further down I go into this dark unhallowed
The smell of dead cadavers surrounds me

I confront this demonic soul guardian
I slaughter the foul beast and snatch the divine book

I feel linked to the book
It tells me that I am
The one to rule this blasphemic planet

No longer will I
Trust such claims
Cadavered sorceress

Rushing back to my mistress
And out of this corrupt place
I feel something terribly wrong but at the same time
Hurry back, save my love before she perishes
Into the underworld and out of our beloved land
Strutting across this other world
Raped I am not but minions defiling each other

Strange this place is
I hear voices
They call my name
I sense it's aura
I fellow these hellish cries
Slowly and slowly they pierce my brain

I open the door to her dwelling place only to
Find her already dead

I fall to my knees
My heart beating like
A woman when orgasmed

The journey I have just
Accomplished was all a waste.

I remove all the skin and armour
Remain in the nude

Cadavered sorceress
