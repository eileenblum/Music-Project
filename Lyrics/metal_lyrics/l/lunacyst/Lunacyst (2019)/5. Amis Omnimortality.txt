Amis omnimortality

Pain and suffering I endure
Her battered carcass in my arms
Tears of sorrow run down
My face, I scream in agony
Nothing I can do
But hold my sensual love

While this glorious beauty yet
Perishing soul
Lays in my arms

She whispers slowly
Saying; you've been mislead
My trusted servant
By this abhorrent life force

I ignore
I desire only
In saving her.
She tells me about the book

It has the power to eternal life

I feel comforted by these talks

I decide to steal this mystic book

For myself so that I may
Save my mistress

I must reach there before my foes do
Never will I leave her alone

This time will be
My first time
I must save her
I love her to death.

As I'm holding her body
Stench starts to leave
Abnormal fluid substance everywhere
And orgasmic thoughts

Amis omnimortality
As she grasps for breathe
I finally tell her everything.

She mumbles in the most erotic voice
I've always known
