I remain unseen behind piles of morts
These grotesque troopers slaying and butchering
The stench of rotten bodies lingers
Blood splattered everywhere, the foul beasts fornicating

Dismembering souls
Mutilating the helpless souls of this morbid realm
Carnage turns into lust
I wait, and I gaze in despair my heart longing to save them
I can't do anything!

Smiling
Them legions
Abusing these carcasses
Ripping
Their flesh
And consuming their insides

This sight angers me, exasperate
Blood boiling within me, annihilate
Crackling cartilage, deteriorate
Gorging on viscera, inebriate.

After this horrid massacre has ended
Annihilators will leave the grounds

Children, women and the men lay decomposed
Torn into pieces

I decide to take body parts back with me
My mistress is pleased

With what! I have got!

I will! Forge a titan!

Plague of Genocide!
Plague of Genocide!
Plague of mass extermination!
Plague of mass extermination!
