I must gather body parts for my love
She desires the most wretched lover
So on I go stacking up remains left by
The creatures, destroyed by the grotesque legions

One by one I pick up organs and other pulverized body parts

Carting them back to my dearests place
So that I may
Sew the most orgasmic
Fuck
She's ever had in a thousand years

I start this unpleasant creation for the divine one

This is madness I need to finish
My body reeks of disintegrated bodies
And the blood dripping

I complete this organic yet vile creature
Back to my mistress
She revives
Starts her fondling

While she's pleasing herself I gets aroused
And get an erection

Pull out my hardened penis
Start beating of to this
Magnificent view
A view I can only dream of, the blood
Dripping from her lacerated vagina excites me even more

Fuck

I wank my dick so hard I start to bleed and ejaculate
The feeling is divine
But the sight is gruesome
