Imperforate I have achieved
This colossal creation pure perfection
Thrusting this massive stretcher to my mistress
I must bring her this flawless

Monstrosity

I confront the sorceress with this opus creation

She admires my handiwork
Satisfaction
She rewards me with gold and women
I can care less
All I want is her unconditional love

Chants of sorcery surrounds this room of darkness
She brings this unholy
Creature to life.

The wicked soul whispers unhallowed chants
Possesses the colossus
Giving it orders of chaos and destruction

Gnarls of animosity
The beast has awakened

His heart in pieces
Anger rages within him

It grabs the enchantress and hammers her down
Bashing her body

Ripping her flesh and disfiguring her angelic body
Feeding on her remains

Blasphemous Deception
