I stand here, my body mutating
Into this vile beast
Blasphemous quadruped

Memories slowly vanishing
Assimilating everything now

I the Cerberus of the divine book
Tyrant of planet lunacyst
I shall be obeyed

Walking around my new claimed land
I yell with wrath and dynamism
Come before your master
Worship and praise him
For he is a generous leviathan

None came forward
They fear of their life's
This act of incivility
Beacon your own demise

He combusts
Huts and farms forcing retreat
He than rapes
Women and men impales children

Ejaculate into women fornicates
Erection hard urge for lust gone insane
Fuck all the children
Put them all to shame
Orphanize your siblings
Consume your perished race

After this massive devastation ends

He stands covered in blood
His dick filled with lacerations

Facing the carnage that lies to waste

He shouts
You will fear me

I am the tyrant
