The book of life and eternal potentiality
Speaks to this dismal mortal about revenge and supremacy

Bierthoogs blood pumping organ
Can't bear the sight of his perished mistress

He tries to free himself from this sate of being

He ignores the books talks and decides to fornicate
With her dead remains and consumes a part of her

His mind is filled with filth and intimacy

He sticks his dick
Inside her decayed cunt
He rips her flesh and screws her intestine
He feels all raw
Blare's of blissfulness

He proceeds with this crudeness

After this vile sexual activity has ended
Still desires more
Injects his blooded dick into her gallbladder

Ejaculates

Fulfills his foul fantasy
The book convinces of it's secrets
To make him understand

The power that dwells within

His body transforms into this mutant disfigured

Behemoth, it strolls on it's journey of chaos and destruction
