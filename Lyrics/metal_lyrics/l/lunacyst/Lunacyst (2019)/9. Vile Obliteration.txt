Vile obliteration
Vile obliteration
Vile obliteration
Vile obliteration

Enters this place of annihilation
To find these outlander's who permeate

Lumbering beside dead remains
He vexations the beast

I feel nothing towards those beings, only
Anger and repulsion
One deceived and the other
Exterminated my people

I must impale them
I must deface them

Lacerate the hearts
Slash the faces off
Burn those wretched peasants burn

I reach my destination
To find these deific exchanging blows

I will massacre annihilate for honor

Pummeling them to the ground
Dismembering their limbs
Devouring their insides
Making an antic out of them

Nothing left but ripped flesh and
Gore everywhere

Success I have achieved

Vile obliteration
Vile obliteration
Vile obliteration
