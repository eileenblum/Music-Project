She will be waking
Waiting to raise from the mud
In her own brightness
She's solitarily proud

My lotus will rise
Show through the dark
Sealed to the ground
My hands not gentle enough to hold her soul
Shimmering lonely star

Quietly thinking
Why hurry this life away
Open-minded intentions
Peaceful with all that surrounds

My lotus will rise
Show through the dark
Sealed to the ground
My hands not gentle enough to hold her soul
Shimmering lonely star

Some day she'll wither
Like the first love in young arms
Calmed by the winter
Frozen inanimate life

My lotus will shine
Glow through the dark
Sealed to the ground
Your blooms tender but strong to hold my soul
Shimmering lonely star

Your lotus will shine
Grow through the dark
Sealed to the ground
Your blooms tender but strong
Enlighten my soul
Shimmering lonely star

Lotus don't linger
Open the cage of my heart
