I have loved for centuries
But I am still yearning
Die or survive your enemies
We are here still craving

I have loved in silent ecstasy
I feel the pulse and the heat
Every move is a hunting breed
It's a creeping desire
You're my purple fire

I could write a century
But my poet lingers
Lie or deny your enemies
We are here still pining

I have loved in silent ecstasy
I feel the pulse and the heat
Every move is a hunting breed
It's a creeping desire
You're my purple fire

We will love for centuries
And we are still pining

I have sinned in silent ecstasy
I feel the pulse and the heat
Every move is a hurting breed
It's a creeping desire
You're my purple fire

I am pining for you
Vervain

I have sinned in silent ecstasy
I feel the pulse and the heat
Every move is a hurting breed
It's a creeping desire
You're my purple fire

Fire burning vervain
