Creeping
I crawled ten miles
Drenched in mud
Scorching sand
I want to lay down
It won't release me
This vacuum sound

Creeper
I am breaking into pieces
I am sinking from reverie
To still life

Creeper
I'm a creeper

Creeper
I creep for life
I am breaking into pieces
I am sinking from reverie
To still life

A drop of love
A second of your keen sight
You make me want to surrender
See me shattered
See me on my hands and knees
But I know there is water underneath us
underneath the desert sand

I'm a creeper
Creeper
I creep for life

A drop of love
A second of your keen sight
You make me want to surrender
See me shattered
See me on my hands and knees
But I know there is water underneath us
Underneath the desert sand

Creeper
I'm a creeper
I creep for life
