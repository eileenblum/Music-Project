Where did all the ravens fly
Earth dry, all starving
Seasons are passing by
Nothing left but a burning sun

Running sweat down my neck
I feel faint, I feel dizzy
No breeze to chill me
Standstill of everything

I can't breathe
Where do we go now
Where do we feed
We used to be hunters, hunters [2x]

Feathers are broken
Worn out and dust-like
Dead weeds and rivers dry
Desolation complete
Fire winds are passing by
Nothing left but a burning sun

Running sweat down my neck
I feel faint, I feel dizzy
No breeze to chill me
Standstill of everything

I can't breathe
Where do we go now
Where do we feed
We used to be hunters, hunters [3x]

I can't breathe
Where do we feed
We used to be hunters
