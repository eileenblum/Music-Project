When the rain's dripping from the ceiling
Mingling with the dark
I feel the fire
Thirsting, longing eyes of those of us
Not yet asleep
The eyes of a beast

come out, come out
I sense no inward struggle not to go
I am detained
Two and a heart
We seize the night and fall with day
You and I
Two and a heart

When the wind's whipping my white skin
I breathe the cold in
I feel desire
Bursting with the need to celebrate
I'm not at all asleep
The mind of a beast

come out, come out
I sense no inward struggle not to go
I am detained
Two and a heart
We seize the night and fall with day
You and I
Two and a heart

One by one we melt with death
Our souls never rest
One by one
No one of us will ever come to rest
We will never come to rest

Come out
We seize the night and fall with day
You and I we're two
Two and one heart
