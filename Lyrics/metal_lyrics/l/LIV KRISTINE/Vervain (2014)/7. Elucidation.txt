I don't mind if you don't care
'Cause we don't have much love to share

Why do we hold on
Why do we hang on to relations
Elucidation, elucidation oh
This feels so wrong
My bright side, your revelation
Elucidation, elucidation
You could feel so loved

I will get over you, I will, you too
Let's build a barricade in the blue
It works in my imagination
So far this always gets us through

Why do we hold on
Why do we hang on to relations
Elucidation, elucidation oh
This feels so wrong
My bright side, your revelation
Elucidation, elucidation
You could feel so loved

I'm drowning in your tide of darkness
Of your damnation

This open space inside is like an open grave of your damnation
I'm drowning in your tide of darkness
Elucidation

Why do we hold on
Why do we hang on to relations
Elucidation, elucidation oh
This feels so wrong
Why do we hold on
Why do we hang on to relations
Elucidation, elucidation oh
This feels so good
