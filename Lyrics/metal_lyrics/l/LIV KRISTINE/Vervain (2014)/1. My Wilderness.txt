We were taught to fight
A wild river pulses in my blood
And the air is soft against my skin
I'm alone at night
And I feel the earth flow
Like a tide inside me
There's a river in my body

I see the circle of all my deeds
I feel the fire in my intentions
I hear my voice
It's finding me
From earth to body
My wilderness

Wash away all trace
The clear water purifies my soul
And the air is soft against my skin
Standing face to face
With the fearsome earth rising
Like a wave inside me
There's a tempest in my body

I see the circle of all my deeds
I feel the fire in my intentions
I hear my voice
It's finding me
From earth to body
My wilderness

My wilderness
My wilderness

My wilderness
My wilderness

I heed my powers
I heed my enemies

I see the circle of you and me
I feel the fire in my intentions
I hear my voice
It's finding me
From earth to body
My wilderness

A sea of silence
It's closing in
On me on fire
On my intentions
I hear my voice
It's taking me
From earth to heaven
My wilderness
