[feat. Doro Pesch]Stronghold uphold my faith in thunder
Black crows, dead leaves, my storm, my fortress
How I remember I kept running from the ruins of you
From the scars you left on my mind
I keep stumbling and falling still you remain

Stronghold of angels light up my night
Let the stars be your eyes
Anchor my promise to stay by your side
When day turns to night

The feel of your hands like the moon pulls the tides
A million waves
One immortal moment
Light up my night, my life

One place in my heart
You left scars, my weakness
White skin, blue eyes
My love, my fortress

Stronghold of angels light up my night
Let the stars be your eyes
Anchor my promise to stay by your side
When day turns to night

The feel of your hands like the moon pulls the tides
A million waves
One immortal moment
Light up my night, my life

The feel of your hands
The blue in your sigh leaves me with anger
The cold in your voice
The love you denied left me no answer

Stronghold of angels light up my night
Let the stars be your eyes
Anchor my promise to stay by your side
When day turns to night

Stronghold of angels, Voices device
When I fall to the ground

Stronghold of angels light up my night
Let the stars be your eyes
Let the stars by your eyes
Let the stars be my eyes

My faith in thunder
