I saw their silhouettes passing
Along the sleepy walls
I heard their voices interrupting
Cold falling raindrops

I'm oblivious and I can't forget
You were all I had
And you burned my earth
I'm holding on to ashes
Oblivious
I just can't let go
I'm oblivious and I can't stop the black
From blinding me with hatred

You saw the woman in me passing
Deluded into gaze
Hearing you whisper sweet nothings
You left a silent rage

I'm oblivious and I can't forget
You were all I had
And you burned my earth
I'm holding on to ashes
Oblivious
I just can't let go
I'm oblivious and I can't stop the black
From blinding me with hatred

What if I burn my own bridges
What if I cease to feel
This gaping wound of jealousy
Is the demon standing before me

I'm holding on to ashes
And I just can't let go
I'm blinded by hatred
I'm sickened with love

I'm turning oblivious
I'm drowning in jealousy
I'm blinded by hatred
I'm sickened with love
