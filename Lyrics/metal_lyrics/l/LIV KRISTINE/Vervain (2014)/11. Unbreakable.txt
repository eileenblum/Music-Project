[Bonus Track]Breaking forth
You tempt the deepest flood
You break forth where no man has set his feet
Savage blood plays in your veins
Whisper to me in your native voices

I thought my eyes were dead to light
My heart too still to love
My skin too white to be touched
I dwell in fear
A shadow too vast to cast a shade in your room

When you stay near I'm unbreakable
My mind is slipping away
My visions turning grey
Yet I am healing

You break through every wall
You will always find me
If I could get a little braver
A little more courageous
Then you will make me heal

Breaking forth
You dive the deepest oceans
Force forth where no one has left a mark
Savage blood runs through your veins
Sing to me in your native music

I thought my eyes were blind to light
My heart too kind to love
My skin too white to be touched
I dwell in fear when you are here
I'm unbreakable
We're unbreakable
