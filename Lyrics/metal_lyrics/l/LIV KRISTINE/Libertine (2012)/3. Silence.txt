I need to lay down in the water
Close my eyes to hear my heart beat
I need to get a little closer
To myself to know why Iâm breathing

I am near now
I am here
I feel it gather rainbows in the deep
Silence in the deep
You may hear, but you canât see
My visions of eternity
Silence in the deep

I dream of crystalline water
Because I think, but I canât speak
My prayers are hidden in the water
If I could I would make you believe

This is what weâve got
Heaven, wash me free
All that weâve ignored
Is here inside me

I am near now
I am here
I feel it gather rainbows in the deep
Silence in the deep
You may hear me, but you cannot see
My visions of eternity
Silence in the deep

I want to be silent
I need silence
Can you hear me?
I want to be silent
I need silence
Silence in the deep

You turned a stone into a flower
Behind the wall there was me
I learned to weep on your shoulder
How could silence be so sweet
