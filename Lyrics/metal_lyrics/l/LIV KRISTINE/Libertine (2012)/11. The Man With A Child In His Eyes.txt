[originally by Kate Bush]I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there
When I turn the light off and turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon

But suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love 'til eternity

Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes

He's so very understanding
And he's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late
He's always waiting but I feel him hesitate

Oh, I'm so worried about my man
They say, no, no, no, no, no, it won't last forever
But here I am again, my girl
Wondering what I'm doing here
Maybe he doesn't really love me
I just took a trip

Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes

I can hear him knocking
(Ooh, he's here again)
I can hear him knocking
(Man with a child in his eyes)
Oh, he's knocking at my front door

And he's breaking my heart
(Ooh, he's here again)
(Man with a child in his eyes)
But I love him, yes, I do

(Ooh, he's here again)
Just a man, just a man
(Man with a child in his eyes)
He's trying to do the best he can

(Ooh, he's here again)
I can hear him knocking
(Man with a child in his eyes)
And he's trying, trying to be a man, y'all

(Ooh, he's here again)
He's a child, child, child, child
(Man with a child in his eyes)
