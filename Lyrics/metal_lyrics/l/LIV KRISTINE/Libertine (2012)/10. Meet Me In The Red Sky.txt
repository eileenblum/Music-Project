I promised with every breath
With every word I say
Solace and sympathy
You give me all the blame I can take

All you are
All you can take for yourself
All you can give
All I can forgive

Meet me in the red sky
See me cross the water
Iâll find you when youâre under
Hold you when youâre feeling down
Hold you when youâre under before you fall asunder 
Meet me in the great red sky

I get closer with every step
With every prayer I say
Curse my identity
Then paint me all in white, Iâm to blame
