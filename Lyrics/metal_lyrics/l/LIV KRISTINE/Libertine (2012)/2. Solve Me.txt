Iâve got my arms open
I left you a heart wide open
It has passed form man to man
But I love you in the way only I can

If you can solve me
Mend me whole
Cry with me
I know you can solve me

Baby youâve got your eyes open
When youâre asleep theyâre open
You skim from land to land
But Iâll find you on the edge of a dead end

If you can solve me
Mend me whole
Breathe with me
Sigh with me
Cry with me
I know you can solve me

You can stay alive with me
You can solve me
Play alive with me
Come on solve me
I know you can solve me
