Creeping upon me at night
Like a numb shadow
Calling my echoing mind
Armor forced aside

Why am I here within sight
Of your crime?
Oh, this is my fate
Loveâs going to die

Copious tears that fall
Leaving winding scars
Innocent painful grief
Shining in your eyes

Why am I here within sight
Of your crime?
Oh, this is my fate
Loveâs going to die

Why are we here 
Between love and hate?
Oh, is it too late?
Loveâs going to die

This is our fate
Our love is a crime
This is our fate
Love is a crime
