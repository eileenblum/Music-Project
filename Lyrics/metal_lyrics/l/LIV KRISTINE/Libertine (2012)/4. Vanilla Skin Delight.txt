[duet with Tobias Regner]Glitter shoes on dirty pavement
Trip up on a Thursday girls night out

I can see the light shine through
And the floor is drowned in red white blue
(Neon lights)
Moving lips in ecstasy
I can feel your heart beat chasing me
(Dior scent)
For a moment of delight
For a moment of your sweet mean bite
(Chase the guys)
Cause I need, yes I need and I canât deny

Vanilla skin delight
Vanilla skin
Delight tonight
Vanilla skin
I canât deny

Growing love around the corner
Hot sweet sticky naked shoulder, Iâm yours

I can sense the need in you
To become the star in all eyesâ view
(Neon lights)
Move your hips in ecstasy
I can hear your heart beat wanting me
(Dior scent)
For a moment of delight
I will curse you for your sweet mean lies
(Chase the guys)
Cause I need, yes I need and I canât deny
