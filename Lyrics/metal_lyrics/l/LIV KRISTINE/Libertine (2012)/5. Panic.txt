Will I calm down now?
Feel the warm ground now?
But what if there is poison in my tea cup,
A hole in the bath tub sucking me down?
What if a man is knocking on my blue door
And I shouldnât have trusted him,
Heâs got an evil core?

Oh, you cause me panic
Iâm drowned in pale white
Cause I donât wanna be here, but I canât get out
Because you make me panic and I canâtâ¦

What if youâre a hunter youâd want my blood 
And I just didnât see it cause I fell in love?
Iâm gonna build good fences to keep them out
What if I see your faces sticking
On the pane at night?

What of youâre the hunter youâd want my blood?
Do you want my blood?
Bloodâ¦ panicâ¦ bloodâ¦ panicâ¦
You make me panic
