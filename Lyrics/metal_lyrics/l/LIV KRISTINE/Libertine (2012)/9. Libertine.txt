I donât need your lies 
Cause you donât impress me, you see
The ice is getting thin
Time to turn around and go home

I wonât fight this war for you
All I do is passing through in your life
I tell you itâs over tonight

Libertine, you are like stardust in the rain
Illusion fades
Youâre just one shadow in this game
Libertine, you think youâre free
But your heart is chained
Itâs just an illusion
A pale illusion of what life really is

I donât need your bliss
Cause itâs not shiny
The nights are getting colder
When youâre alone
When youâre older
