After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left
But a bare and sore ground,
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin.

And the cold wind blew the hazel trees.
And the cold wind blew,
Reminding them of how old they are.

Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy:
It was at the end of the day,
It was at the end of the day.

And the cold wind blew the hazel trees.
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees.

It was at the end of the day,
Although the beginning of a
New and bright tomorrow.

Deus ex machina...
Deus ex machina...

After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters -

There was a last sudden gust of wind
Before the life and freshness again
Touched every heart, mind and soul
And the comfortable summer breeze
Played with the green leaves of,
Of the hazel trees
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are.
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are.

Echoing a sorrowless
Future to come,
They thought about their lives
How satisfying they were
(How satisfying they were),
And they spoke with happy
Childlike voices.
And they spoke with happy
Childlike voices.

After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters.
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters.
