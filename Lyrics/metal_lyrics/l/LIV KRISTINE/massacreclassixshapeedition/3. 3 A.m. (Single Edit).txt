I can find no sleep, I never sleep at night.
I stop counting sheep: I can see their eyes
And the lights will shine tonight.

A fly's been watching me, a million dogs arrive:
Some will cover me, some choose to bite.
And the lights will shine tonight,
And the lights will shine tonight.

Then I will come to life,
Then I will come to life.

Won't you come with me? I can ease your mind.
Dreams, thoughts, fantasies keep rushing by,
And the lights will shine tonight.

I can find no sleep, I never sleep at night.
All those pretty sheep sit mesmerized,
And the lights will shine tonight,
And the lights will shine tonight.

Then I will come to life,
I can guarantee that
I will come to life.
Then I will come to life.
I can guarantee that
I will come to life.
