Living souls around me
They don't see
Just staring, closed faces
Fake a smile

Shaking hands, shake their heads
But they don't speak
Only demanding the right numbers
Of me, breaking into pieces
I'm breaking into pieces

My world is turning too fast
I can't get off this spin
I'm moving somewhere I don't want
But all I do is fake a smile

It's so cold around me
I hurry to the next stop
I'm waiting, for something
For someone, to steer me back to my life
Steer me back to my life

My world is turning too fast
I can't get off this spin
I'm moving somewhere I don't want
But all I do is fake a smile

When will I break
When does the ice break
When will I dare to press rewind and start all over
