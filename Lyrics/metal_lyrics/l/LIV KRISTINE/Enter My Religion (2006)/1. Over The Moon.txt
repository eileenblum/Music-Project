I was on my knees
Crawling through the dry Sahara
I was breaking down
Every wall standing in my way
And look what I found; the road to heaven

I'm over the moon
Thought featherly-light sky I fly
I'm over the moon
Since I found you

Crossing boundaries
Between my old and new life
Search the open field
For a flower of my taste

And look what I found; the road to heaven

I'm over the moon
Thought featherly-light sky I fly
I'm over the moon
Since I found you
But I know
What can't tear me down
Makes me much stronger
So it's good for something
