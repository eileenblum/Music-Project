Life is a wonder, I've entered the gate
Time can be healing if you just learn to wait
Pain makes tears flow but it tells you to pray
And the night is our fortress when we're tired of the day

Opposite thoughts make me wonder sometimes
Is there something out there I don't know

But your smile makes me wonder, did you mean what you said
And a million thoughts went through my head
Your words make me cry and laugh I guess
I am caught in an ocean of blue emptiness

Faith is stronger where weakness rules
Changes will open your eyes when it hurts
A coin has another side staring at you
And love causes freedom and prison in you

Opposite thoughts make me wonder sometimes
Is there something out there I don't know

But your smile makes me wonder, did you mean what you said
And a million thoughts went through my head
Your words make me cry and laugh I guess
I am caught in an ocean of blue emptiness

But the faith and the trust and your strength is my harbour
Faith, trust and love, I carry within me

But your smile makes me wonder, did you mean what you said
And a million thoughts went through my head
Your words make me cry and laugh I guess
I am caught in an ocean of blue emptiness
