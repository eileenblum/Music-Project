I met you in a hidden yard
I held your hand for a second time
You kissed my lips and what I felt
Was the blossom of a rose

I didn't rain the times you cried
You left a sea of a million tears
And I took a deep breath and all I won
Was a second and one tear

Enter my religion
I have found our path
There's a handful of surprises
Cause I discovered a heaven for us

I told you I'm so glad you came
I held your fate in my palms
You turned around and what I saw
Was the prophecy of my life
