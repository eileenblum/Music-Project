You're the line I follow in my life
Two separate minds but one lousy excuse
Wasting time, I'm slipping through life
I'm in a bad movie with a predictable end

My revelation is waiting for you
You keep on denying, denying the truth
My revelation's waiting for you, waiting for you

My revelation is waiting for you
You keep on denying, denying the truth
My revelation's waiting for you....

You're the contrast in my own self
Two different bodies but one reason to make love
Silly games in a book of pleasure
We're a bad clichÃ© in a cheap short story
