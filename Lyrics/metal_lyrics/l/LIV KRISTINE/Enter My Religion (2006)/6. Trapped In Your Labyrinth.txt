You always thought I'd be someone
Someone to comfort you at times
When you seem to give it up
I carry, carry you away

I always have the strength to fight
To be so strong when you are weak
But no one asks me what I feel
And no one ask me what I need

Do you feel what I need?
Realise I am here
I am trapped in your labyrinth
I wish I could find my way out

I tried to unveil the truth
But you don't seem to understand
I'm showing you the best in me
And never, ever asked for more
