I didn't know where to seek life
Spirit growing from clear conscience
Breathing within me
My life has just begun
Since you bumped into my world

I feel like I'm coming home to you
Imagine all the things we can do
I feel like I'm coming home to you
Being close to you again

I didn't know where to search for the answers
This burden of question's to heavy to carry
I climbed the mountain of freedom
And I've picked a flower of truth

I feel like I'm coming home to you
Imagine all the things we can do
I feel like I'm coming home to you
Being close to you again

You keep me down on earth when I feel I've lost my ground
You're the ground of my life when I feel like I've lost my faith
