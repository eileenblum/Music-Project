You take my higher
Higher than I have ever been
You take me higher
I'm loaded with your energy

You take me higher
Higher than I have ever been
It's like the sunshine
I'm loaded with your energy

Everybody wants the sun to come out and everybody wears the sun in their faces
I love to be amazingly free
Everybody wants to swim in the sea and everybody loves the breeze in their faces
Flirt with me, it sets you free
