Sometimes I feel so small
When truth is told
But I can't grasp the meaning of it
And I am wrong
And nothing seems to get along
All is just too distant to understand

Then how can I resist
The thought of walking through the warm rain on a summer's day
Your hand in mine
Being in the middle of it
Just feel and don't think
For a moment

Perhaps I'm just to close
To find the entrance
To your hidden dreams and thoughts
But I am lost
And no way seems to be the way in
You are just to complex to understand

Then how can I resist
The thought of walking through the warm rain on a summer's day
Your hand in mine
Being in the middle of it
Just feel and don't think
For a moment

Soothe my mind when it hurts
Stop saying all these words
Even one moment of silence will do
