You're the night that gives me all these fears
It's your light that gives me harmony
You're the night that gives me loneliness
It's your light that gives me all I need

I stop acting like a fool, let me go
Did you think you could get just everything
I don't believe in love anymore
Cause you got away and broke my heart again

Ah ah ah you are the night, the night

Stop playing the same drum all the time
Don't you pretend you have blindfolded me
I don't believe in words anymore
The made me cry so very hard my friend

You're the night that gives me all these fears
It's your light that gives me harmony
You're the night that gives me loneliness
It's your light that gives me all I need

Look at yourself and you will see
The eyes of a man you wouldn't dare to trust
Take all your lies with you and go
Cause you broke my heart and left me cold again

You're the night that gives me all these fears
It's your light that gives me harmony
You're the night that gives me loneliness
It's your light that gives me all I need

I could have loved you so much more
But you shut your mouth every time I mention us
You never believed me anyway
Cause you knew that would be an end to it
