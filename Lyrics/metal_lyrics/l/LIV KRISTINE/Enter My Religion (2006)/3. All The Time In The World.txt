My dreams shimmer in my sleep
Slow-burning ever-lasting fantasies

Even if you haven't found me yet I will find you
If you wonder who's knocking on your door; it's me and there's no need to worry
I shiver at your door but surely you don't have to hurry
You've got all the time in the world
All the time in the world

On the pavement of your favourite street
Dressed in white hoping you will see... me

Even if you haven't found me yet I will find you
If you wonder who's knocking on your door; it's me and there's no need to worry
I shiver at your door but surely you don't have to hurry
You've got all the time in the world
All the time in the world

If you wonder who's there
I'm not an alien girl just walking by
Just crossed your street
