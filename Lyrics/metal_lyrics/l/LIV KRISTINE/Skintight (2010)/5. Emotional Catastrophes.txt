I like the way you're holding me
You like the way I swear to you
We're stumbling through this tragedy
But I've switched the lines now
(Yes I did)

You now I smile of you being a fool
But I get so tired of watching you
Oh bitter curiosity
Tell me what this really means
(Is it real?)

Emotional catastrophes
Another unhappy end facing me
You play the joker
In this foolish tragedy aha

Because you caused in me a tragedy
Another unintentional I'm-sorry deed
You think you played the ace
But then you lost the game
Losing me aha

Is it me, is it you, is it real?
