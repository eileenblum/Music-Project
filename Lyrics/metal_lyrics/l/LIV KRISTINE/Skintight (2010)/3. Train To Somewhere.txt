I want to lay here
My head's going 'round
Stay right here between there and anywhere

I want to live now and get away with it
I need to feel the steam and let temptation win

I want to sin right now and leave no fingerprints
Put the safety chain on
Don't forget your tiepin baby

Catch the train to somewhere
All aboard at six to noon
I want to curl up at the sunset
Count the stars in Hollywood
Make your life a little brighter now
Have a slice of freedom baby
Catch the train to somewhere

Don't want to sacrifice another day's wait
Hesitation overruled
I'm ready for my bite
Ready for my bide
Ready for my ride

Let's catch the train to somewhere
All aboard it's six to noon
I want to cruise along the
Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood
Catch the train to somewhere

That's my ride to somewhere
