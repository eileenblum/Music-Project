Passing houses
Passing walls
Concrete swallows all my thoughts

Rushing to win time
Rushing for more
These flattering figures
Admired by the masses

A tree at the crossing
A tree in a park
A beaming green spot
Enlightens my mind

Tempting nightlife
Tea-room talks
Never touch the core

Boy at the window
Boy always running into loneliness
The boy at the window
His mind is blue
Divided by love and hate
For the life he never knew

Blessed by the city
Absent gods
They don't hide in the concrete
Or in bewildered dogs

Blinded by grey
Blinded by one smile
I should have waved at him
I should have

Boy at the window
Boy always running into loneliness
Boy at the window
Boy wants to tear down loneliness
I saw the boy at the window
Boy wants to tear down loneliness
I know the child at the window
Would break the pane to get through
And reach out for the love inside you
The love he never knew
The life he never knew
