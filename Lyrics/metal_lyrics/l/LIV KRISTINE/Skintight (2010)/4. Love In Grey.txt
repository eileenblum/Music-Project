You walked away with truth
Hid it in a thought so there's no proof
Visible, audible
Now thrust is in a thimble
Needles sticking through

What is love in grey
Memories are fading away
I left passion on a nail
You never ever whisper my name
I am a shade
Love is turning grey
What is love in grey

The gravity of our promises
Gradually abused
You turned me down
Consequences got confused
Lust locked in a drawer
Key thrown away for good

Oh my love is turning to grey
