I learned to love
I learned to give
When I was little and all around me seemed to live

I learned to swim in the sea
To run across endless fields
Time and space was so unreal

You showed me a wonder in everything
You were the calming voice that spoke the truth
And I knew the day would turn to night
Everytime you dimmed the light
And the moon dimmed my mind

Oh I was so proud of my new red-velvet gown

I learned to sing, then I talked
I sang all day all those songs
I loved to fly on Sunday's clouds

You picked me up after school
Because the boys were so rude
Until the day I hit back too

Oh how I cried that day
A pearl was hiding in my ear
Remember I was scared
Black panthers underneath my bed

You showed me the wonders of every spring
You were the calming voice that talked so wise
And I knew the day was close at hand
Everytime you dimmed the light
And the moon dimmed my mind
Oh then the day would turn to night
