Where am I floating to?
Where am I going?
Touch the surface
Of a lonely wave

Forget that I'm afraid
My heart-beat takes me
One second further
One thought forward

I claim to be myself
The race of a warrior
I might crash against these rocks
But I will hold on to my life line

Where am I floating to?
Where am I going?
My strength on trial
Breathe in salty sea

Too far for me to see
The land of ever-green
And island landscapes
Fairer than the sun

Rain on me
Cover me with gold
Gods let me through
The gates of the sun

Deep in my own self
The race of a warrior
I might crash against these rocks

But I will hold on to my life line
To my life line
