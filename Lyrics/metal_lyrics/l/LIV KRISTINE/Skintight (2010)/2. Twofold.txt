My question was honest
I'd made up my mind
Then why do I shiver
Talking to him

There's something about him
Something I fear
His eyes hide a hardness
I cannot bear

Don't leave me alone
You can' just deceive me and go
Twofold
His love turning cold
Oh no

His answer was twofold
I ran into doubt
Then why does he tyrannize
My good-natured soul

His mind's all twisted
Twisted and different
He'll walk all over me
If I let him

Don't leave me alone
I can't just leave him and go
Twofold
His feelings are cold
Mmm

Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
You can't just leave me
Can't just leave me
