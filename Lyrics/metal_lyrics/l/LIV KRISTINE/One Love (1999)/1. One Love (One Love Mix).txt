Out of the corner of my eye
The hand full of life,
Abandon what you lie,
But never live to die.
One love, one life.
You better look to find
One love, one life.

I call on you, I'm gonna travel
To the end of the night.
One love, one life.
I'll start anew, I'm gonna travel
To the end of the light.
One love, one life.
I call it one love, one life,
Call it one love, one life.

You're low and down with life
I long to see you shine.
I'll wave to you my life,
A sense of time and pride.
One love, one life.
You better look to find
One love, one life.

I call on you, I'm gonna travel
To the end of the night.
One love, one life.
I'll start anew, I'm gonna travel
To the end of the light.
One love, one life.
I call it one love, one life,
I call it one love, one life,
Call it one love, one life.

One love, one life,
One love, one life.

I call on you, I'm gonna travel
To the end of the night.
One love, one life.
I'll start anew, I'm gonna travel
To the end of the light.
One love, one life.
I call it one love, one life,
I call it one love, one life,
Call it one love, one life.
