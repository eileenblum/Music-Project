The woman in me went over the top,
Forget and forgive, she's made up with you.
That stranger in me, where was I before?
I think I was scared of letting you in.

Don't let it swallow you from inside
And take away the best things in you.
I hold on to the woman in me,
The woman in me.

The person in me, she wanted to be
The woman you love, the woman you need.
And what have I found? The partner I missed.
The person in you loves the woman in me.

Don't let it swallow you from inside
And take away the best things in you.
I hold on to the woman in me,
The woman in me.

The woman in me, the woman in me
The woman in me.

Don't let it swallow you from inside
And take away the best things in you.

The woman, the woman in me,
The woman in me.

Don't let it swallow you from inside
And take away the best things in you.
Don't let it swallow you from inside
And take away the best things in you.

The woman in me, the woman in me
The woman in me.
