This china heart breaks easily
Love under glass, like Snow-white's lips.

Will you enter my kingdom
And will you come with me?

So close my china heart
When you walk into my dreams.
I hide behind a dragon's face,
But my heart is yours, yeah, my heart is yours.

These humid eyes cannot foresee
What will come next, if scars will heal.

Will you enter my kingdom
And will you come with me?

So close my china heart
When you walk into my dreams.
I hide behind a dragon's face,
But my heart is yours, yeah, my heart is yours.

So close is it to me
When you walk into my thoughts.
I hide behind a dragon's face,
But my heart is yours, yeah, my heart is yours.

Will you enter my kingdom
And will you come with me?
I will allow you companion
Of someone breaking china hearts.

These scarlet lips
Want to be kissed,
But what a shame
Without a prince!

Will you enter my kingdom
And will you come with me?

So close my china heart
When you walk into my dreams.
I hide behind a dragon's face,
But my heart is yours, yeah, my heart is yours.

So close is it to me
When you walk into my thoughts.
I hide behind a dragon's face,
But my heart is yours, yeah, my heart is yours.
