Living souls around me,
They don't see.
Just staring, closed faces
Fake a smile.

Shaking hands, shake their heads,
But they don't speak,
Only demanding the right numbers
Of me, breaking into pieces;
I'm breaking into pieces.

My world is turning too fast
And I can't get off this spin.
I'm moving somewhere I don't want,
But all I do is fake a smile.

It's so cold around me.
I hurry to the next stop.
I'm waiting for something,
For someone to steer me back to my life,
Steer me back to my life.

My world is turning too fast
And I can't get off this spin.
I'm moving somewhere I don't want,
But all I do is fake a smile.

When will I break?
When does the ice break?
When will I dare
To press rewind and start all over?

This world is turning too fast
And I can't get off this spin.
I'm moving somewhere I don't want,
But all I do is fake a smile.

This world is turning too fast.
I'm moving somewhere,
I fake a smile.
