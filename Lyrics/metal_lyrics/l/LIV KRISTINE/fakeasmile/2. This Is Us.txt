Living under daylight
Is loving you in my eyes.
If you wonder why the sun shines
It's for you and me and eternity.

Living under daylight,
Is loving you in my eyes.
Dreaming in the moonlight,
Of you and me: this is us.

I can't resist you in the rain,
It makes me free, still it's this pain,
And lets me know that I exist,
'Cause I exist only for you.

I'm restless when you are away,
It makes me cry, this is sweet pain.
Do you know, do you know?

You shock me, yeah,
When you kiss me.
You don't have to fear,
'Cause I always feel this beating heart.

Living under daylight
Is loving you in my eyes.

I can't defend myself tonight
Is in a fire makes me fly,
So I'll just let myself become
Of both, of you, only of you.

It's indescribable caress,
It makes me burn and melt away.
Do you know, do you know?

You shock me, yeah,
When you kiss me.
You don't have to fear,
'Cause I always feel this beating heart.

This is us, this is us,
Ooh, yeah, yeah, this is us, this is us.

Ooh, yeah, yeah, this is us, this is us.
