He drains all of my lifeforce
A body like a unicorn
Its a phobia
In this crowded room
The people just stare

Silver sun entering space,
I want to just pass around
It's now in my face
All my days am I human or worse
All my days, I'm turning over

All my days, I'm turning over
There's a land
The dead has captured
It's no less beautiful
It's a phobia
In this crowded room
The people just stare

Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground

Ah...
All my days, I'm turning over
The last time around, Here we go
I should be in Heaven, But I don't go

All my days am I human or worse
All my days, I'm turning over

Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
