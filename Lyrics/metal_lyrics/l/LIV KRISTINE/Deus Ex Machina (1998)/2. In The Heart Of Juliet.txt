She's the month of June
A summer's tune
The wind that blows
The flower that grows

She'll forever be
So proud and free
A firefly
The sun in the sky

And forever she'll dance
It's the summer
Of her days and forever
Her heart is yours

In the heart of Juliet
One love she won't forget
She longs to give
Forever live
Her soul has such desire
She needs to love, admire
A tide to the shore
Searching for more

No vale of tears
No hauting fears
Another birth
She's joy on earth

Dancing like a child
So pure and wild
A virgin rose
She longs to be close
