I can find no sleep - I never sleep at night
I stop counting sheep - I can see their eyes

And the lights will shine (all night) tonight
And the lights will shine tonight

A fly's been watching me - some (a million) dogs arrive
Some will cover me - some choose to bite

Then I will come to life - I can guarantee that
I will come to life

Won't you come with me - I can ease your mind
Dreams, thoughts, fantasies keep rushing by

I can find no sleep - I never sleep at night
All those pretty sheep sit mesmerized

Then I will come to life - I can guarantee that
I will come to life
