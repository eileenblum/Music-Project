Creep into thy narrow bed
Creep, and let no more be said
Vain thy onset! All stands fast
Thou thyself must break at last
Let the long contention cease
Geese are swans and swans are geese
Let them have it how they will
Thou art tired; best be still
They out-talked thee, hissed thee, tore thee
Better men fared thus before thee
Fired their ringing shot and passed
Hotly charged and sank at last
Charge once more, then, and be dumb
Let the victors, when they come
When the forts of folly fall
Find thy body by the wall!
