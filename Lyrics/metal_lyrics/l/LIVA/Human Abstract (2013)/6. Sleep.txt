Sleep brings no joy to me
Remembrance never dies
My soul is given to misery
And lives in sighs
Sleep brings no rest to me
The shadows of the dead
My waking eyes may never see
Surround my bed
Sleep brings no hope to me
In soundest sleep they come
And with their doleful imagery
Deepen the gloom
Sleep brings no strength to me
No power renewed to brave
I only sail a wilder sea
A darker wave
Sleep brings no friend to me
To soothe and aid to bear
They all gaze, oh, how scornfully
And I despair
Sleep brings no wish to knit
My harassed heart beneath
My only wish is to forget
In the sleep of death.
