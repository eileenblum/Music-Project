Daughter of God and mother of all,
Link of the world and its firm tie,
Beauty of the earth, mirror of what runs past,
Torch of the globe;

Peace, love, virtue, government, power,
Order, law, term, road, guide, origins,
Life, light, brightness, shape, face,
Rule of the world;

You, who submit your reins to the pace of the world,
Tie in a harmonious bind all that you consolidate
Into being,
And, through the concrete peace unite
Sky and earth;

You, who apply the pure ideas of the Word
To the touch of every sort of being,
Adorn matter into form, and shape with
