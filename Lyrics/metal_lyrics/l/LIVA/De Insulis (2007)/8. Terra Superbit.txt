You, who modify the face of the heavens into Proteus
Where you create new arrangements,
Populating our air with birds and
Gripping everything under your rule;

Under whose sign the world rejuvenates,
And the forestâs hair curls with leaves
And, the earth boasts,
Wrapped in our cloak of flowers;

You, who appease and enhance the threats of the waves,
Cutting the marine fury short,
Fearing that the anger of the waves
Might bury the surface of the continents;
