By ending its beauty,
Age or the course of time sweep it away,
Soon deflowers its splendour.
Flower turns into fruit, gem into mud,
Man turns to dust, and to death
Paying his tribute here below.

For his life, for his being are
Sorrow, pain, necessity
To end in death.
So death shuts life, mourning shuts laughter,
Shadow shuts daylight, the tide shuts the sea
And night shuts morning.
