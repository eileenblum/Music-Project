You, who are favoured by the heavens of which air is the servant,
Who are honoured by the earth and revered by the waters;
To you, as to the ruler of the world,
Every element is paying tribute;

You, who chain up days and nights in their alternation,
Dispense the day from the candle of the sun,
And bring to sleep the clouds of the night
Under the clear mirror of the moon;

You, who gild the pole with various stars,
Make serene again the sphere of our ether;
Fill up the heavens with the starsâ gems
And a colourful army;
