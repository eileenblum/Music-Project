The flower expires by breathing,
It raves by fading,
Starts to die at birth.
Both ancient and new,
Both elderly and damsel,
The rose fades at birth.

So the spring of our age,
In the very morning of youth,
Flourishes for a brief moment,
But this morning is soon excluded
By nightfall while the twilight years
Conclude.
