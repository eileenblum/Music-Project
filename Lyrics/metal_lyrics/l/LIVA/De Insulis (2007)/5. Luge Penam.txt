Thus enclosed under this law,
Man, decipher your condition,
Look closely at who you are,
What you were before your birth,
What you are, what you will be,
Deepen this vision.

Weep in sorrow, lament your offence,
Suppress your impulses, break your pomp,
Cast off your pride;
Leader and coach driver of your soul,
Lead it and direct its course
Not to veer to evil.
