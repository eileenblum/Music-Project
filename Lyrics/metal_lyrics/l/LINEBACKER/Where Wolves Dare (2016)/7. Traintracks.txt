Is it just me
or the sun just got smaller
the clouds are now taller
the fog made it harder to see

is it just me
and the lungs of my brothers
now sing and sing louder
make demons go farther from me

building these walls I go all alone
building these walls I remain alone

as the train tracks twist and turn
I roam this path on my own
wondering
will I ever find home

as the train tracks twist and turn
I'll find my way back home
just to make sure that they'll meet in the end

I feel nothing tell me why
my heavy eyes won't let me lie
this block of ice won't break
man I'll remain the same

the devil sees my fists of righteousness but he keep punishing me
I can feel his pitchfork, but it's a pain that I'm used to
all my life I've built these walls so that no one could touch me
at the end of the day hell is the best place to stay
