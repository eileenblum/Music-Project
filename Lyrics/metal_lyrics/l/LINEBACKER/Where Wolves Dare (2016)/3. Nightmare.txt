Been running away from this nightmare my whole life
too scared to face it so I hide it all behind a smile

sleepwalking my life away

sinking to the bottom, letting it all consume me
I can't recognize myself, I'm a pale reflection of what I used to be

the lights go out but the shadows remain
it feeds and it grows inside like a parasite
will this ever go away, I've turned my back but still it haunts me

Let me go
