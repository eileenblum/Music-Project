Living and learning I roam these streets
know every corner like the palm of my hand
pay no mind to your social illusions
because I got everything, everything right here

Streets of rage
while you call it a danger zone
I'm proud to call it home

don't tremble when you hear the name
I walk these streets day and night
here I feel just fine
I dare you to cross the line

you call it danger zone
I'm proud to call it home
