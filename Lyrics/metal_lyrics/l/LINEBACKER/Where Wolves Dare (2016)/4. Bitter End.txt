Life on the fast lane, nothing to lose
hopes are high for the great unknown
without a care, path to destruction
pressure is rising, no time left.

digging deeper and deeper, no turning back
"this is my life, can't bring me down"

another day rises, the knot seems tighter
weakness and blindness take over your life
without options you still wear your pride
lost becomes real, reality unfolds

digging deeper and deeper, no turning back
look at your life, what have you done?

you left us here
to bear all the reasons
when you hung up your life
and forgot what it meant

look at your life!
what have you done?
look at your life!
what the fuck have you done?
