An almost undone kingdom
the outgrowth of human intelligence
tearing apart, down to the core
destroying life's essence

reasonless animals
gods of our own mistakes
we change and destroy our own existence
on a march towards extinction

the clock is ticking, there's no two minute warning

wrapped seas in grief
scared off by our fearsome presence
knocking down the walls
that were once built

starvation and drought
are leaning over us
we realize that the air we breathe
is nothing but our own poison

we are nothing, we are nothing but a plague on this earth.
