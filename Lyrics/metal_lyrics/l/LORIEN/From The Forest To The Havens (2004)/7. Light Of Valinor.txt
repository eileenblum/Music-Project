Beyond what I dared to hope
There's for me a new reality
Made of precious dreams
I will be no more alone
Shivering in the long cold winter nights
Waiting for the dawn

You give me the warmth I always wished
The one who'll always be with me
You know where to look to find the truth
There's bliss and there is:

Light of Valinor in my eyes
Since I found it in you
Our soul's one for two
We are meant to share this life

Through your eyes I can see
All the beauty and majesty
Of that Realm where the gods
Dwell for all eternity
