Can I stop the wheel?
Of my crazy time
Living on a dream
That makes me down

Losing all the hope
Walking the tide line
Searching for some words
In my silence

You came as uninvited nightmare
You killed beatifull scenes of my dream
Stealing all what was mine
While the mankind plays lying games
All the innocence is leaving
And my hope dies with you

My time is at the end
I wait for the perfect soul
I dropped many tears for it
Being the slave of my dreams

One more night bearing the intruder
Lost in my thought reading my mind
Playing with me as a fool

I'm bored of the meetings with
The monster of my madness
Too much time becames real

I want to sing no more
In this world so cold and blind
Where the Wrong used to face the Right
All this lets me down

Only there is one way to save
What we need to live
Sitting next to the Truth and
Wandering what we must do to change
Our attitude
Sitting by the side of life
