There's something new for me awaiting
Now I am back alive from the Netherworld
Darkness is greater than ever before
But I must win

Huge are the armies or my cruel enemies
They are arising swiftly here and there
I am so tired but I will not rest
War is about to begin

I am back from hell
From the belly of the earth
Where the demons dwell
And the air is filled with wrath

Much help is needed so I search for my friends
Maybe allied we shall be strong and prepared
Elves, dwarves and men marching out through the fields
Will do their best to be free
