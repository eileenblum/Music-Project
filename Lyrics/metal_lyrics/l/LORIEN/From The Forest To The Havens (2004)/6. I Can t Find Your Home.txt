Scared to talk
Scared of your smile
I want to say I love you

I can feel
My heart beating for you
You robbed half of my soul

I believe
That angels are like you
I often look at the sky
And I ask God
Which could be your cloud up there
I can't find your home
Give me a sign, and I'll come to you

It's my shame
My gratest enemy
I cannot freely use my words

Just a Chance
I need to talk to you
About my love in poetry

Show me
How to reach the place
Where you keep half of my soul walking alone

Without you
Without guide
Without light
And hurt because of love

So just tell me
If you feel the same
Do you know that I love you?
