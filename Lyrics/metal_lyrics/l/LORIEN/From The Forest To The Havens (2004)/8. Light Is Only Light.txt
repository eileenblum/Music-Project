A ray comes in
Through the window pane
The sun makes your mind clear
A calm, a peace
Flows from your chest
Time stops for a while, round me

But when the darkness makes you blind
You can't find the way
The same things, the same place has been changed

The truth, a lie
Same thing, different sides
What do you really want?
If you don't know
What you are looking for
Just go...go...go on

Don't be deaf don't be blind
When the light fades away
Light is only light just feel it?

Don't be afraid, don't be scared
Only one thing has changed
Your eyes are not your guide
Feel your heart
You still have the power
You still have the staff
Remember everything
Is the same
