Who is it? Who's calling me?
I can hear you from afar
I am coming hastily
Along a path beneath a million stars

As I child I saw your smile
It was cunning, it was charming
And your face was so divine!
You bewitched me deeper than you think

So full of joy
I am following the sound
Of a weird voice
I am hearing all around

Though you live beyond this world
You can't find forever more
In the shadow of oblivion
I can feel your soft caress

Little pixies you must be
Dear fellows you are for me
Magics's drifting in the forest
I can feel its soft caress
