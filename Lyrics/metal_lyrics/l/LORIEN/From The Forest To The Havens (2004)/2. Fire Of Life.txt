Seeds of evil were sown in places unknown
Under the dark sky
They grew up without light in the endless night
Of the most ancient times

Beasts with a dreadful strength created to end
All what is noble
They are raising up fists and chanting their hymns
They are ready to strike

All what's fair and lovely and good
In the land that lived in a bliss
They are now the bringers of doom
They have spread disease

But they'll never reach the heart
Of this realm where heroes know
The real power
For their strength cannot be fought
There's fire in their souls
Fire of life!
