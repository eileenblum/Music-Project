From the cradle of temptation
Crawling souls lost their paradise
They were living with their sadness
Hiding their bodies from the Sun

Blinded by a phantom menace
That was called Original Sin
Human walked with fear inclined
Oh, searching for the mercy of God

Do you see the shadow
Of the Angel shown on the wall?
He has come to give us a new chance

Take the Breath Of Salvation
And ride this wind
Fly to new horizons
Then wait for me

Close your eyes in the darkness
And hear the voice
Whispering the divine words
To forgive the Sin

Be aware of the snake ambush
It is just awaiting your fall
There's a way into my quest that
We follow but we never know

Touch the flame of the Angel
Feed from his cup
That's the blood of his body
The Angel is me
