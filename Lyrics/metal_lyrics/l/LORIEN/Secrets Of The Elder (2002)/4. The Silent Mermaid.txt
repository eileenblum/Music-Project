I am a mermaid in love with a man
So I was punished, my tongue was cut off
I can sing no more but I talk with tears
Pain fills my heart drown in fear.

I spend my time gazing at ships passing by
Looking for my beloved among the crew
I swim towards him 'till he looks at me
Hoping he will guess my desire.

[Chorus]
If I only could sing
I would have his heart
In my hand.

He would be caught
In the spell
Cast by my melody.

[Bridge]
(but) I'm a silent Mermaid
I'm mute forevermore
Even if I weep
I wont be heard.

I am eager to save from a wreck
My dear sailor to be close to him
In a tight embrace we will reach the shore
I will not let him leave me alone.

It's hard to remember how long I have been
Waiting for my lucky day to come
Though I have no voice
My lips hope to kiss
And my heart is filled
