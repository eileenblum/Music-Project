I feel cold when I'm next to you
I can't hear the Freedom Call
My spirit is living far from here
You are tying me to this life.

I don't know,
What Is freezing now my heart
Far away,
From the crowd I can survive!

I believe is all those things
That makes me dream
I am steering my own course
I'm at the wheel.

Next to the fire
I like thinking on my deeds
Overcoming fear to
Carry out my destiny.

[Chorus]
I sing this ballad
Because I'm one of the Knights
Who has escaped
From the chains of this dark world!

It's a misty day today
Your eyes can't see
You are falling into a trap
From which I've escaped.

I'm getting stronger
When the wind blows through my hair
Whispering the right way to
Keep on my own path.
