Like the steel cuts the cold
When I am far away
More and more I'm nearer
My own destiny.

This is the place where the light
Fills the sky with magic
And the sight of the night
Is the most sublime.

The fantastic purple flames
Live in the vast Northern lands
Burning our hearts with fire
Making our eyes shine.

Mystery makes me feel
More real than ever
When I am finally going
To my palace.

Made of ice, colossal,
Among the mountains
Everything is only mine
When I feel the power.

I have walked a long way
'cause I made a promise
And I know that the wind
Caught my desperate words.

Under the fire, on the ice,
Or in my last breath
I will pray for my soul
And for eternity.
