Once I looked deep inside
Your pretty shinning eyes
Once I heard your sweet voice
And the words you told me.

A fire started to burn
In my spirit in my heart
In my eyes shone a light
'cause since then I smile again.

You caught me in your web
But I am not scared at all
I just want to be yours
Let me be your daily meal.

How I wish that our souls
Could be the same forever

How I wish that our hearts
Could bury the fears of the past.

Don't be afraid
All I want is giving you my love
Close your eyes
Sing with me this lovely song of Love.

Let's fly away up high
From here to paradise
The sky is glad to see
Both of us together.

Let's feel the magic wind
That will blow through our hair
Let's listen to its whisperings.
