Once again I find
Myself wondering
Why are we here
What's the meaning of life?

Someone people say
This life is just a way
To a better one
In communion with God.

I'm prepared for what
I have to do
To live - To last.
Forever and ever
Like the
Whole creation - Infinite universe.

For mankind
Live in fear thinking that
We all shall die It's
Time to reach Neverland.

So I think that
I can be, if I want,
An eleven prince
In a forest of dryads.

I can go with
My own thoughts to the land
Of Avalon
Through the mist of the swamp.

I do not need
To be rich in this world
For I prefer
To keep my spirit free.
