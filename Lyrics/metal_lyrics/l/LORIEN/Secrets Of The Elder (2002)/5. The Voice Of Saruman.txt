Saruman, the betrayer
Will miss all the magic and the might
He's gone astray, he's in the sight
Of the dark lord.
He forgot the right way
'cause he yearned to be like a god
But now he cries.
But he will never lose
The gift he has in his voice
Which is something he will always use.

The words he will pronounce
Will seem full of wisdom
Who will resist their magic sound?
The voice of Saruman
Will bewitch those who hear
It sounds like the wind blowing the Sand.

There's a man with a staff
Walking a short way towards his end

Towards the realm
Under the blast
Of dragon fire.

That's the game of deceit
That the wizard's playing with no Trace
Of that old flame
That always burned
Inside of him.

The words... The voice...

There are no Gods around
Ready to appear when he is praying
They don't believe
In what he's doing
They won't be there.
Banished from everywhere
Up and down the Middle Earth he'll Roam
His glory end...
