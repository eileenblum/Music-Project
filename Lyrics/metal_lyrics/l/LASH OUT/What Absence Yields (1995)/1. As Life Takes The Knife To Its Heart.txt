Blew out the candlelight
Brought the night to my house
I invited it inside
Let it conquer my mirror
Read my books and laughed
In a locked room I kept my child
Took it out to be shot in daylight
It had my dreams on its chest
When it was burried

Nameless
Faceless
Cornered
Son of mine

Felth the warmth of cold steel
And the loneliness of the silence
And the emptiness of my power
The strength of a sodacan

Homeless
Breathless
Broken
Son of mine

Planting seeds to stomp the flower down
Send it off shore to let it drown
Adrift at the sea of nothing
Peel of the wound to stop it bleeding

Meet the circle
The center of your history
The wheel of life
It controls your blasphemy
You go into struggle
To take your own flag
And to protect the worn path
Sing deaths silence
Silence...

Air fills the holes
The shadow takes my place
Water fills the veins
The lies occupt my tongue

Breathe
Bleed
Breed...
The dark seed

The pieces play the game
I inhale the true day
The past oozes from my cracks
History turns its yellow page...

Nameless
Faceless
Cornered
Son of mine

Planting the seed to stomp the flower down
Send it off to let it down
To let it drown
Trapped by the mask
Chained to man

Homeless
Breathless
Broken
Son of mine

Adrift at the sea of nothing
Peel off the wounds to stop the bleeding
Let it bleed

Torn bitter bruised
Life manifests...
Itself
