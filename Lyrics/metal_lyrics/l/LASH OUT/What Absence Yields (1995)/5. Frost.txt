Center my powers to release
All the days gone wrong
Rip them out from my memory
Like pictures from a book

I picked flowers between the rails
Didn't hear the train coming
Before it was one yard away
I can not walk alone

Guide me, hold my hand
Protect me from the frost
Different rivers formed by our tears
Different rivers from the same sea

Words from sentences all wrong
My quotes come undone
Reanimate my creation
And close the door behind

Pride comes before fall
Ejects from the fog
Break the bowel of broken dreams
And memories

Remember the memories that were made
Forever will I fill your sails
Blank the pages of yesterday
Tomorrow breeds another day...

I can not walk alone...
