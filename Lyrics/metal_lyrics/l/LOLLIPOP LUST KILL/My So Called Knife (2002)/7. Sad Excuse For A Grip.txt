Its hard to say if I am alive

Disorder runs rampant in my mind
Loose thoughts slipping through my sad excuse for a grip
Random ideas bouncing around like a rubber ball in a rubber room
Uncatchable

my mind is going numb
my mind is going numb

I find myself tripping in your eyes

Delusions creeping up from behind
Sticking, probing, trying everything to falter me
These floating thoughts will trip me up; make you knowing me
psychopathically
Impossible

i have become
so mentally undone
i have become
my mind is going numb

You have tempted me forever

suddenly my thoughts come into mind
It seems Ive found the problem that has been plaguing me
i think of pain i think of death
and then i find my mind specificly incredible

i have become, i have become, i have become
so mentally undone
i have become, i have become, i have become
my mind is going numb

Dead girls bloom
In my garden of thought
Spreading and decaying
To become one with the silt of my mind

i have become
so mentally undone
i have become
my mind is going numb

i have become
so mentally undone
i have become
my mind is going numb
