It seems I like it when you cry
My codependant lullaby
Ill only play when I make the rules
Your mental weakness is my obvious tool
It seems I like it when you cry
So let me inside

[Chorus]
Im alone with you and you're afraid of me
Tightly close your eyes and pray you just can't see
Everything, I; everything, I
Everything, I; everything, I

Blow out the candle, save the light
One last dead breath it ends your night
Hold out your hands and pray not to die
Grow your little white wings and let your angel fly
Blow out the candle save the light
And let me inside

[chorus]

Everything I want from you
All the lies that you beleived
Everything I misconstrue
Is everything you cant conceive, yeah

Can you see me here alive with your own two eyes
Can you see me here alive?

Please wont you tell me why you died
And within the deadness was their light
Where are you now and how does it feel
Is there a soul or is our mind the real
Please wont you tell me why you died
And let me inside

[Chorus]

want
need

Everything I want you to see
Everything I want you to be
