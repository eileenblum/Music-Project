I've got this evil feeling
It's overwhelming me
To build these devices
That cause your agony
I know your body needs me
And I will be your king
I'll give you pain and I'll do it again, again, again

I want you to die
Dr Killgreedy
You will soon receive
Pain you can't believe
Die I want you to die
Dr. Killgreedy
Pain so sweet to me
Got to make you bleed
Die I want you to die
Dr. Killgreedy
Take you sentencing
Bloom inside of me
Die I want you to die
Dr Killgreedy
Pain so sweet to me
Got to make you bleed
Die I want you to die

I've this dirty needle
To pierce your skin so deep
I've got this rusty scalpel
To feel it just say please

I know your body needs me
And I will be your king
I'll give you pain and I'll do it again, again, again
I want you to die

Dr Killgreedy
You will soon receive
Pain you can't believe,
Die I want you to die
Dr. Killgreedy
Pain so sweet to me
Got to make you bleed
Die I want you to die
Dr. Killgreedy
Take you sentencing

Bloom inside of me
Die I want you to die
Dr Killgreedy
Pain so sweet to me
Got to make you bleed
Die I want you to die
YEAH Die mother fucker Die
YEAH Die mother fucker Die

We've got molten metal dripping into forced open eyes
Taking out your teeth with a rusty wood file
Cutting off your skin as your tied down to the bed
Listen to you scream as I drill into your head
It's music to my ears when I hear you scream in pain
I will torture you till I've driven you insane
I am Killgreedy baby bleed, baby bleed
I am Killgreedy baby bleed, baby bleed, yeah
Die
Die
Die
Die
