Dominating forces catipult my thoughts
I want and need to control every aspect of you
I must control everything, keep you under my thumb
I will mentally @#%$ till you break or I leave
Berate and humiliate as my father did to me

The abused will abuse

[Chorus]
I want to be the one for you
Want you to be the one for me
I need to see inside your mind
Want you to see inside of me

I am a mental predator
Feeding on your childhod traumas and mental monsters
I will use my insecurities against you
And Ill live to make them yours
Long string of failed relationships

My father lives inside of me

[chorus]

Why? [repeated]

[Chorus]

Kill my father, heal my father
