"What's going on here?"
"Murder, you want some?" [Sample]

Come on everybody let's go to the show
Murder is fun because my daddy told me so
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
Punch em like a mother fucker even rape a few

Fuck the righteous wave and ride the evil undertow
If blood is what you want embrace the demon glow
Grab a gun, grab a knife, even hands will do
You punch em like a mother fucker even rape a few

We are the villains
Sucker fish fuckers down in the sink
We are the aliens
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We are the losers
Flushing our faces into the world

This is a sin fix
This is a sin fix

Now that we have seized you and pleased you
Come alive and murder your senses
Find yourself knee deep in the dead
Come alive and murder your senses
This is a sin fix
This is a sin fix
