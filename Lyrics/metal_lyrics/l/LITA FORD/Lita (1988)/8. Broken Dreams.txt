I see the picture
You're so broken hearted
But can I steal a little love from you tonight
I'd tell you whispers, a little story
That there's a place in my heart for you tonight
But why must we be lonely?
On this night full of rain
Hold me in your dreams
And leave me breathless once again
But I will never understand
Why must the rain fall down?
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Must the tears fall, misty sky
It's a boulevard of broken dreams
Yeah
I close my eyes, and it feels like yesterday
When we fought for tomorrow
And lived for the day
So sweet and innocent
Like a child with his toy
Who wishes for nothing
Left alone with his dreams
But why must we be sad?
On this night full of rain
Take me back to the king
And leave me breathless once again
But I will never understand
Why must the rain fall down?
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Must the tears fall, misty sky
It's a boulevard of broken dreams
Oh, yeah
Why must the rain fall down?
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Must the tears fall, misty sky
It's a boulevard of broken dreams
Why must the rain fall down?
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Another lonely face lost in the crowd
It's a boulevard of broken dreams...
