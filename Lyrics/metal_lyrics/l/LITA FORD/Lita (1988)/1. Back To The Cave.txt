Oh, let's get back to the cave
No one ever told us we had time to waste
Oh, let's get back to the cave
For a little while, for a little while
Life on the outside, life on the edge
Pushin' all the buttons of love
Drivin' in the wedge
Somebody's takin' from you time and time and time again
Can't believe it's not the way you want it to be
Oh, let's get back to the cave
No one ever told us we had time to waste
Oh, let's get back to the cave
For a little while, for a little while
Somebody lookin' for you
Somewhere you've seen a face
Somehow it leaves you feelin' lost and out of place
Too many wasted nights
And way too many darker days
There's nothin' left to make you burn
And nothin' left to make you wanna stay
I'm lookin' deep inside you, down where you were before
And when I find you, I'll be wild and knockin' down your door
I'll drag you screamin' from this endless and angry scene
You can believe it's just the way you want it to be
Oh, let's get back to the cave
No one ever told us we had time to waste
Oh, let's get back to the cave
For a little while, oh, yeah, for a little while
Oh, let's get back to the cave
For a little while, oh, yeah
Oh, let's get back to the cave
For a little while
