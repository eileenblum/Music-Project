Are you a hero, or are you the lonely one?
Do you ever get scared, don't you ever feel pain?
Under the loaded gun
You are a Romeo, with nowhere to run
You are the winner that loses in the end
Under the gun
So you stand up and fight
For what you believe
There is no wrong or right
There is no black or white
Now the time has come
It's your turn to die,
Under the gun
Under the gun
How many heartaches can man one take?
How many lonely dreams are shattered,
By one man's mistake?
So shed a tear for the tough guy
Now the damage is done
No one to justify the truth, my friend, hey!
When you're under the gun
So you stand up and fight
For what you believe
There is no wrong or right
There is no black or white
Now the time has come
It's your turn to die,
Under the gun
Under the gun
Yeah!
