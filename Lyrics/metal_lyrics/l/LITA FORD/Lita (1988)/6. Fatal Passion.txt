When I was 18, you know I fell in love with you
But you were the bitch babe
I guess you'd call it a fatal passion
You try to pull my trigger, always leading my on
Makin' up your own rules, I was always the clown
Times must change now, you'll see it my way
I just can't take it
What you don't know, I must say
I guess we both had a lot to learn,
Uh, huh
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned
Don't call me insane, 'cause that's not my game
Turn your head, you're dead
From a fatal passion
Cross your heart and hope you survive
Fatal passion
You're like a broken picture
A mirrored image I can't see
You tried to lock me up
And you swallowed the key
My mind's been twisted
Time my wounds must heal
Lookin' back in anger
Now you know just how I feel
But tell me where do you draw the line,
Uh, huh
It's time that you realize
Don't call me insane,
'Cause that's not my game
Turn your head, you're dead
You try to pull my trigger, always leading my on
Makin' up your own rules, I was always the clown
I guess we both had a lot to learn,
Uh, huh
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned
Don't call me insane, 'cause that's not my game
Turn your head, you're dead
From a fatal passion
Cross your heart and hope you survive
Fatal passion
Fatal passion
Fatal passion
Fatal passion...
