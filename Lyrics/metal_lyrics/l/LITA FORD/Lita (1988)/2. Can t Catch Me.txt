Don't try to push the strong arm on me
You'd better think twice, I ain't no Sandra Dee
Don't think I'm easy, I wasn't born blonde
I've been around, 'n' I'll be here 'n' gone
And I've seen things that you'll never believe
Fast mover, 'n' you can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Catch me if you can
I been up, 'n' I been down
I been messed up 'n' turned around
I been a fool, 'n' I been wise
I've seen shit 'n' paradise
And I still got the aces up my sleeve
Fast mover, 'n' ya can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
So catch me if you can
Oh! What a pity, such a pretty boy
California's little pride 'n' joy
But that ain't all it takes
I need more than just a pretty face
I deserve an ace with a little taste
Don't come sniffin' 'round my tree
I'm off 'n' runnin', you can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Ah! No, you can't catch me
No, you can't catch me
No, you can't catch me
Can't catch me Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Ah! Catch me if ya can...
