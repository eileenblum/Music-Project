I call him heaven, I call him earth
I call him lover, stick my fingers in the dirt
I call him dangerous, Dangerous Dan
I call him over, take him anyway I can
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
I call him lover, I call him strange
I call him over, I concede the ball and chain
I take him hard, make it hard against the wall
I call him over, any time he needs control
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
I'll be blue for you
I call him lover, I call him strange
I call him over, I concede the ball and chain
I call him dangerous, Dangerous Dan
Dangerous Dan, I'll take you anyway I can
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
I'll be blue for you
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
I'll be blue for you
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
He call me Blueberry, Blueberry,
Blueberry, very blue
I'll be blue for you...
