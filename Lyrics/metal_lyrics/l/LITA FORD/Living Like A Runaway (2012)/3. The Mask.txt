I don't have a death wish, you have to remorse
You have no reflection
Dragging me off course.
You've drained me of my life
Drinkin' all my blood
Who are you, what do you want.
Am I your desire? Higher.
Take off your mask, and let me see what's underneath
Something from the past, it's been ... waiting me
I got to see what's really inside
I will never know (never know)
His one big surprise you shackled and hide.
Under your mask
You think you got everyone fooled
They think you got class, all you do is
Ridicule
I will never know what's buried inside
You wont let it show
It's one big disguise you shackled and hide

Shackled and hide.
I wont the silver crown
It burns a whole right through my heart
His words nothing worth
Hey, til death do us apart.
Ye-yeah!

I don't have a death wish, you have to remorse
You have no reflection
Dragging me off course.
You've drained me of my life
Drinkin' all my blood
Who are you, what do you want.
Am I your desire?

I will never know what's buried inside
You wont let it show
It's one big surprise, you shackled and hide
Shackled and hide.
I gotta see under the mask.
Yeah, you schackled and hide.
