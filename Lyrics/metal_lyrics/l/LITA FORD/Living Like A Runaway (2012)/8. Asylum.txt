Walking through these halls
Filled with anger
Screaming for my life
But no one answers
And in my head the voice are doomed
The walls are cold and I sit true
I'm forever lost, in the asylum

The scars of your love on my wrist
The scars of madness on your fist
I tried to save the ones I love
I prayed for love of god above
I'm forever lost, in the asylum

No one will believe, the story I tell
No one could imagine such a lonely hell

No one seems to help me now
As though my words were all blacked down
And reaching on the walls, of the asylum, yeah

Instead I turn those tables round
You knock me down on hallow ground
Our wedding vows we pronounce, into the asylum

The whispers of the ghosts of dreams
The way I hoped my life would be
One day I know you'll realize
Our love was meant to die
I don't wanna die, in the asylum
The writing on the wall, in the asylum.
