[written By Nikki Sixx]Distorsion out of face
Washes over my sour face
My life is thru, I guess I owe it all to you
Check me out.
You left me wondering what I'm about
You sucked dry and you spit me out,
There still one thing I can do
So I wrote this tune just for you!
A Song To Slit Your Wrists By,
A song my health, a twist
A Song To Slit Your Wrists By
A song my goodbye kiss!
Yeah!

Black tears, white towel
My face check out the cloud
The dark faith I'm thru

I just keep writing this tune for you.
A Song To Slit Your Wrists By,
A song my health, a twist
A Song To Slit Your Wrists By
A song my goodbye kiss!
Yeah!

Distorsion out of face
Washes over my sour face
My life is thru, I guess I owe it all to you
A Song To Slit Your Wrists By,
A song my health, a twist
A Song To Slit Your Wrists By
A song my goodbye kiss!
Yeah! It's so good!

A song my goodbye kiss!
Oh, kiss this!
