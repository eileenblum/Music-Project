[iTunes Bonus Track]Caught in the sights of a killing fire
On streets filled with ashes and smoke
Flames reaching up to a dirty sky
Like some kind of sick deadly joke

[Chorus:]
Can't stop what hate started
There's no cooling down
I'm past the boiling point now

Every day my TV screen
Is pushing me to make somebody bleed
The chains 'round your neck got me wondering
How you'll ever get the freedom that you need
Can't turn this world into heaven
By burning it down to the ground

I'm on fire
I'm burning up
My temperature's rising, point of no return
Watch out or you just might burn

[Chorus]

The walls fall down like dominoes
Nobody's left to pay what's due
Too many crazy people running round
Starting wars between me and you

[Chorus]

I'm on fire
I'm burning up
My temperature's rising, point of no return
Watch out or you just might burn
