There's lighting in the distance
The wind begins to howl
There's thunder at my window
I'm going out for a prowl
It seems to me when lightning strikes
Knocks me off my feet
The trouble I'm in is black as sin
But your touch feels so sweet

Love don't come easy for a lonely soul like me
I find myself in trouble on the road to misery
I try to do the right thin but I'm easily misled
I'm drawn to the dark side, and the devil in my head

Ain't an alibi left in town
House of cards comes tumbling down
9 lives and counting as the reaper makes its choice
It seems to me when lightning strikes
Knocks me off my feet
The trouble I'm in is black as sin
But your touch feels so sweet

Love don't come easy for a lonely soul like me

I find myself in trouble on the road to misery
I try to do the right thin but I'm easily misled
I'm drawn to the dark side, and the devil in my head

Sometimes the angels are watching over me
To rescue me,
And sometimes I feel lucky to be alive
I don't know why I keep coming home
To the devil in my head
Yeah, I keep coming home
To the devil in my head, alright

[Guitar solo]

In the ghost of a blind man, see in the mirror of time
Does the soul of a thief steal mercy from the scene of the crime

Love don't come easy for a lonely soul like me
I find myself in trouble on the road to misery
I try to do the right thin but I'm easily misled
I'm drawn to the dark side, and the devil in my head.
