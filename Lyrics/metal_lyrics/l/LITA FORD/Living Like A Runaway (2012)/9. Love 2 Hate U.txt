You gave me diamonds,
You built me mansions
You gave me everything a girl could want
You bought my first tattoo

I've sent you flowers, oh and flowers
I gave you everything your heart desired
And your little too

[Chorus]
I know love's a sacrifice no doubt
Something we can't live without
Yeah, I think I've worked it out
Why I love 2 hate u,
Why I love 2 hate u

I've bought you leather, black leather
I've bought you everything a girl could want
I bought you the first guitar

I gave you loving, your first real loving
In the back seat, on the night
I bought your first real car

[Chorus]
I know love's a sacrifice no doubt
Something we can't live without
Yeah, I think I've worked it out
Why I love 2 hate u,
Why I love 2 hate u

But there's just something that's missing
Must be your heart and soul
There's an emptiness inside you
No matter what I say, no matter what I do
I just love 2 hate u

[Chorus]
