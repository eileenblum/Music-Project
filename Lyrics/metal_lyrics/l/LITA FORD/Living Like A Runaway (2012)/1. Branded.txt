I donât wanna fight with you no more
Unless you put your fist through the wall
I donât wanna hear you screaming my name
Iâm so tired of playing the same old game

I donât wanna fight with you no more
Unless you put your fist through the wall
I donât wanna hear you screaming my name
Iâm so tired of playing the same old game

Yeah you left your mark on me
That you know is branded
It was an insecurity
So you had me grounded
You really got your hooks in deep
Now didnât you?

I took a little ride
On your hell-bound train
It was a really bad trip
It nearly drove me to my grave
And too much time was going by
And youâre still here
Itâs time for me to fly

You never wanted me to leave
So you had me branded
Your love was just skin deep
So you had me branded
Tought Iâd be yours for eternity
So you had me branded
You really got your hooks in deep
Now didnât you?

When we first met
You said let down your wall
Let me into your heart
We can have it all
You were a real smooth talker
I opened up my heart
So you can rip it apart
Oh-oh
Just like Satan
Obsession, possesion forever

You never wanted me to leave
So you had me branded
Your love was just skin deep
So you had me branded
Tought Iâd be yours for eternity
So you had me branded
You really got your hooks in deep
Now didnât you?
Yeah
Branded!
