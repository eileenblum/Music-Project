I am your mother,
Your flesh and blood, your family, yeah
And like no other
Until they bury me 6 foot deep
No matter what the future holds
And even know you just began to grow
Just know you'll always have your mother

The damage is done,
I never wanted things to work out this way
My little ones, how do I say how sorry I am
Some day you'll see the truth
And you'll come running back to me
Just know you'll always have your mother
You'll always have your mother

He lies to you, and blames it on me
He tries to find comfort in insanity
Should be crucified, oh, left to die
He paints an ugly picture of you and I
It's so far from truth - it's hard to see
The only way to hurt me
Was through my love for you
I am your mother
Please understand why I had to leave
Pain was deep,
He was hurting me,
When you look in the sky at a shinning star
Listen to your heart and know who you are
And I'll always be your mother
I'll always be your mother
I'll always be a part of you.
