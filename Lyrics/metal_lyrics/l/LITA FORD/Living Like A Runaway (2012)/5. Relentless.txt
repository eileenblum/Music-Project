Every door slamed in my face,
Told me a girl needs to know her place,
I never listen, proved them all wrong
Hard rocked their asses from here to Hong Kong.
I'm not invited, but I'm coming anyway.

I am relentless like a freight train coming to the driving rail
Relentless like a fighter in arena I don't feel pain,
I am relentless, all you try to do is drive me insane
And you're never gonna keep me down,
I am relentless.

You try to brake me and take my crown
Run my name into the crowd
Life's what you make it, no one's to blame
And all that matters in the price of faith.
You try to spot me but I'm coming anyway.

I am relentless like a freight train coming to the driving rail
Relentless like a fighter in arena I don't feel pain,
I am relentless, all you try to do is drive me insane
And you're never gonna keep me down,
I am relentless.

[Solo]

Never got the cover of the Time magazines
And I play guitar like a ... ever seen
Can play the records hanging on my wall
The bigger they are you know the harder they fall.
I'm not invited, but I'm coming anyway.

I am relentless like a freight train coming to the driving rail
Relentless like a fighter in arena I don't feel pain,
I am relentless, all you try to do is drive me insane
Oh yeah, (relentless) yeah yeah, hey

I am relentless like a freight train coming to the driving rail
Relentless like a fighter in arena I don't feel pain,
I am relentless, all you try to do is drive me insane
And you're never gonna keep me down, yeah!
I am relentless!
