I'm no angel
I'm far from it
Yeah, when push comes to shove
I can rise above it
I get down
But I ain't easy
I spoil myself
So it's so hard to please me
Baby, I'm ready, willing and able
And if you feel like a man, lay your cards on the table
I don't gamble
But I take chances
And if love is a game
That a fool romances
Then I'm a fool
One more time
So start makin' your move
Before I change my mind
Baby, I'm ready, willing and able
And if you feel like a man, lay your cards on the table
So get your ass in gear and do it for me babe
Uh, get down
Well, you're different
To say the least
Yeah, you've got the power
To change the nature of the beast
Well, only time
Will really tell
But, on down the line
I know I'm still alive and well
Baby, I'm ready, willing and able
So get your ass in gear and do it for me babe
Get down
