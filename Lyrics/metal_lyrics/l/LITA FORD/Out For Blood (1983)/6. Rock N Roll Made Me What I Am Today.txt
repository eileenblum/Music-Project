I used to listen to the radio
Playin' songs I wanted to hear
Up in my room and played it loud
'Til the music hurt my ear
My parents said to turn it down
But this is what I'd say
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
I had a dream that I was sweet 16
And could play in a rock &amp; roll band
I saw some guys that played guitar
They said, "Come on if you think you can."
And the next thing that I know
I find myself right here on the stage
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am...
You know people are always tellin' me
To get out before its too late
Say, "It's a passing fad."
And that the money's bad
I'm gonna wind up in a grave
But if I could do it all again, you know I would not change a thing
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
Rock &amp; Roll made me what I am today
