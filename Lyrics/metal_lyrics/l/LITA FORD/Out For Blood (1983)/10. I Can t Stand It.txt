I still remember everything you said
I'll love ya tonight but don't get uptight, no
Then I knew I'd never see you again
I want to make up with you but what can I do?
I can't stand it
Tonight you're here but tomorrow you're gone, oh, no
I can't stand it
The love that was real, got wasted away, oh, it's gone
I still remember the look in your eyes
Well, I wish I could fly, you make me cry
'Cause you were somethin' that I never had
And I never will but still I keep dreamin' of...
I can't stand it
Tonight you're here but tomorrow you're gone, oh, no
I can't stand it
The love that was real, got wasted away, oh, it's gone
I will wait forever, just to have you one more time
'Cause it's the only way, I can't ever keep you out of my mind
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
You know there's no other way
I can't stand it
You know I can't take it no more...
