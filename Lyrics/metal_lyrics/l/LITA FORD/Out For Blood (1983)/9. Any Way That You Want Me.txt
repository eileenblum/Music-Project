If it's love that you want, then, baby, you've got it
From the depths of my soul, yeah, uw baby, you've got it
'Cause I've been watching you, and I don't think that you'll gain
And there's no need to explain
Any way that you want me, any way that you'll take me
Any way that you'll make me be a part of you, any way at all
If there's dreams in your heart, the love lasts forever
From the depths of my soul, I'm making love control, for me and you
'Cause I've been watching you, and I don't think that you'll gain
And there's no need to explain
Any way that you want me, any way that you'll take me
Any way that you'll make me be a part of you, any way at all
Nothing you can say or do
Can turn my heart away
But my love for you keeps growing stronger
Each and every day
You know you can have it any way you want it
I'll give you all I've got to give
You can take it, any way
Any way, any way
Any way, any way
Any way, any way
Any way
Any way that you want me, any way that you'll take me
Any way that you'll make me be a part of you
Any way that you want me
Any way that you want me
Any way that you'll take me
