It's been five days, my mind's in a haze
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin'
I'm so confused, that you're the one I choose
So rock with me, babe, let's get it rollin'
It's just a feeling that I get
From the first time I ever met you, babe
It's just a feeling I can't forget
So don't kiss me goodbye, just give one more try at your love
The days go fast, you're stuck in my head
I'm so alone, I wish you'd tuck me in bed
Oh, baby, baby, baby, well I knew it from the start
Yeah, right from the start
'Cause it's just a feeling
Feeling
That I get
From the first time I ever met you, babe
It's just a feeling
Feeling
It makes me wet
So don't kiss me goodbye, just give one more try
At your love
Yeah
Oh, when you told me that you don't want me no more
I said, "I love you," ah, but you wanted more
Oh, baby, baby, baby, well I knew it from the start
Yeah, right from the start
'Cause it's just a feeling
Feeling
That I get
From the first time I ever met you, babe
It's just a feeling
Feeling
I can't forget
So don't kiss me goodbye, just give one more try at your love
Won't you give me one more try?
