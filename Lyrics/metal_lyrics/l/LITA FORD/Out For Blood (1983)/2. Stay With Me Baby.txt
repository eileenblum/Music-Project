I find you alone at night
I don't know what you're thinking
Don't know what you're dreaming of
But it ain't me, now is it?
But I gotta know
I can't let my feelings show
'Cause I've always wanted you to give me a chance
Now that I've got you here
You know what you gotta do
Stay with me, baby
I don't wanna make love to nobody else
Stay with me, baby
I'm so tired of waiting, come down off yourself
Stay, baby
To feel you alone like this
I would throw all my kisses
And throw all my love away
But that ain't right, now, is it?
Well someday you'll realize
I was not blind
If I could come along with someone like you?
To save my broken heart
Here's what you gotta do
Stay with me, baby
I don't wanna make love to nobody else
Stay with me, baby
I'm so tired of waiting, come down off yourself
Stay, baby
Oh, yeah
I want you to stay
I find you alone at night
I don't know what you're thinking
Don't know what you're dreaming of
But that ain't right, now is it?
Someday you'll realize
I was not blind
If I could come along with someone like you?
To save my broken heart
You know what you gotta do
Stay with me, baby
I don't wanna make love to nobody else
Stay with me, baby
I'm so tired of waiting, come down off yourself
And stay, baby
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
Stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
With me, with me, with me
Won't you stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Won't you stay with me?
