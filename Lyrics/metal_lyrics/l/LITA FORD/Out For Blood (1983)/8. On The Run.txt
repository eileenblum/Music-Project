Going to town, I'm gonna tear it down
I'm looking for some action
To get a piece of your heart
I lose a piece of my head
It's like a chain reaction
Your love has got me hypnotized
You don't wanna see
My love for you, it's over now
It's time for me to leave
I'm on the run, yeah
On the run, yeah
Oh, let me outta here, I don't wanna hear
Your bullshit confession
Just a smack in the head
You moan in pain in your bed
Staring at no reflection
My mind is racing with the flood
The time is moving fast
My love for you is over now
This love could never last
I'm on the run, yeah
On the run, yeah
What we used to call love, is now one step above
Mental masturbation
Now, I'm bustin' out of this livin' hell
Like a bullet from a shotgun
The road has got me hypnotized
And you don't want to see
That my love for you is dead, is torn
Now I'm on the run
