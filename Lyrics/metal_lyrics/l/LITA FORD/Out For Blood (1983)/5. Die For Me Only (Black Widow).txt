Plays with a vengeance
Controls our very soul
To weave you in my web of love
And never let you go
Time to face your destiny
You've lived come and go
To die for me only
I live just for you
Die for me only
I live only for you
Passion fed by fire, it's far beyond control
Holds us in a sacred flame
And never lets us go
It's meant to be
It's your destiny
To die for me only
I live just for you
Die for me only
I live only for you
Black Widow
Black Widow
Your loving is a death wish
It makes it all come true
I'll love you to death, babe
And suck your life from you
It's meant to be
It's your destiny
Die for me only
I live just for you
Die for me only
I live only for you
Black Widow
