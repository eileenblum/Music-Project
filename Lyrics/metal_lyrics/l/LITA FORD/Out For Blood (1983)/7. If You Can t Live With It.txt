I know life gets rough
Oh, sometimes I cry
But you gotta try a little harder
When you're wrong!
Sometimes I got no friends
Well, that just kinda makes my heart a mess
So I just slap myself in the face and say
It's alright, I still got my guitar
Everyone knows love's a game
Playin' to win but it won't turn out that way
So I just stay at home and have another beer
But shit, you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
Don't you think people are strange?
They never do what they say, no
Hanging you up and making life tough
Don't need to be that way
Don't give me your sympathy
It's for the devil, baby, not me
And don't tell me that I'm wrong
See everyone knows love's a game
Playin' to win but it don't turn out that way
So I just stay at home and have another beer
'Cause if you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
Yeah
See everyone knows love's a game
Playin' to win but it don't turn out that way
So I just stay at home and have another beer
'Cause if you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it
If you can't live with it
Then try and live without it... yeah
