7 o'clock and I'm hangin' here
Thinking where I'd rather be
The same ol' dive and the same ol' jerks
Are tryin' to take a piece of me
I think I need a hit, 'cause I'm sick of this shit
I guess there's only one thing I need
Hey there, sugar baby
Won't you come and rescue me
Be my bad boy
Be my love thing
Be my holy roller
When I can't get enough
I need my bad boy to shake me up
Gotta get out, I gotta get out
I get a little tired of the same ol' jive
I need a real hellcat to show me where it's at
And push me into overdrive
I gotta knack for destruction
With you it's all or nothin'
I guess there's only one thing I need
Hey there, sugar baby
Won't you come and rescue me
Be my bad boy
Be my love thing
Be my holy roller
When I can't get enough
I need my bad boy to shake me up
One kiss, one night
One touch, one bite
It's never too much
It's never too tight
No one else come close
To your perfection
No one else but me
Could be your resurrection
Hey there, sugar baby
Won't you come and rescue me
Be my bad boy
Be my bad boy
Be my love thing
Be my holy roller
When I can't get enough
Be my bad boy
Be my love thing
Be my holy roller
When I can't get enough
Be my bad boy
Be my bad boy
When I can't get enough
Be my bad boy...
