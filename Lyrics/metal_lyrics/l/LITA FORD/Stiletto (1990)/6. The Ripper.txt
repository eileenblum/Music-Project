Hey!
Like a shadow in the night
Molested by his sight
He's come to get you
Sharper than cold steel
He's gonna show you how it feels
Ain't that a sight
Nothin' you can do
You were so special that he drug you straight to hell
Like all the other bad girls
He'll rip your heart, he won't let go
He wants your soul to keep,
Spreading his disease
He'll bring you to your knees
Destroys all he sees,
He's the Ripper
Terror in the streets
Enough to make you scream
He's all you'll ever need,
He's the Ripper
Standing face to face
I get a little taste of his venom
I feel it in my veins
I cannot break the chains
I'm in heaven
I was so special that he drug me straight to hell
Like all the other bad girls
He'll rip my heart, he won't let go
He wants my soul to keep,
Spreading his disease
He'll bring you to your knees
Destroys all he sees,
He's the Ripper
Terror in the streets
Enough to make you scream
He's all you'll ever need,
The Ripper
Now he's taken me
He wants me for his queen
For all eternity,
He's the Ripper
