She don't want no toy boy, joy boy
Licking all around her candy shop
No fast gun, hit and run
Shoot 'em up the middle and watch 'em drop
Bang, bang, get it up rock and roll
Are you up for the hunt, now ready to go
Mouth to mouth, cheek to cheek
She's burning up, she's cherry sweet
All right
All night
If you think you can make it
Think you can take it
Gotta get naked
Well, paint it
Cherry red
Oh, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry Red
Oh, won't you paint it cherry red
Now juicy Lucy
Cream of the crop, she's in love with a chump
She caught him, she's on it
She put him in a hot seat, cooked him up
Big shock light 'em up, watch 'em glow
Pretty little wild thing don't say no
Lips to lips, skin on skin
Pull the switch and let the fun begin
All right
All night
Do you wanna get lucky
Wanna color the monkey
Then paint it
Cherry red
Oh, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Oh, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Oh, won't you paint it cherry red
Paint it
Cherry red
Ah, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Ah, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Ah, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Ah, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Ah, won't you paint it cherry red
Cherry red
Ah, won't you paint it, paint it
Cherry red
Cherry red
