Lisa, you are the shelter for my soul
Lisa, you heal my heart when I lose control
As I let my fingers trace
Each time worn line on your face
I know only love creates a masterpiece like you
I know it's true
Lisa, Lisa, say you're going to live forever
Lisa, Lisa, we're never gonna say goodbye
Only you know who I am
Only you really understand
Nothing's going to take you away
Lisa, I know we live in different worlds
Lisa, I will always be your little girl
And on a stormy night
You built a rainbow to my door
I'll always remember you
Lisa, Lisa, say you're going to live forever
Lisa, Lisa, we're never gonna say goodbye
Only you know who I am
Only you really understand
Nothing's going to take you away
