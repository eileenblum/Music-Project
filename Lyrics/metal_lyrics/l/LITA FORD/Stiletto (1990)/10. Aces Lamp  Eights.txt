We only take what we need
In black and white
The city bleeds
Love cuts you down to the bone
And walks these streets
With the eyes of a hunter
Bad blood flows from
The father to the son
How red the river runs, yeah
Love was the law
For sinners and saints
Dead man's hand holds
Aces &amp; Eights
We're bound by wire, blood and fate
Hanging on to nothing
Aces &amp; Eights
We let each other bleed
And watch our bones
Fall in the dust
You can hear the children howl
It's all they see
In the hour of the wolf
Bad blood flows from
The father to the son
How red the river runs, yeah
Love was the law
For sinners and saints
The dead man's hand holds
Aces &amp; Eights
We're bound by wire, blood and fate
Hanging on to nothing
Love was the law
Sinners and saints
Dead man's hand holds
Aces &amp; Eights
We're bound by wire, blood and fate
Hanging on to nothing
Hey, Aces &amp; Eights
Daytime
Nighttime
Standing in line
At the border
I wanna lay down the law
I wanna tell 'em how it should be
Bad blood flows from
The father to the son
How red the river runs, yeah
Love was the law
Love was the law
For sinners and saints
The dead man's hand holds
Aces &amp; Eights
We're bound by wire, blood and fate
Hanging on to nothing
Love was the law
For sinners and saints
The dead man's hand holds
Aces &amp; Eights
We're bound by wire, blood and fate
Hanging on to nothing
Aces &amp; Eights
Hey, Aces &amp; Eights
Hey, Aces &amp; Eights
Uw, yeah, Aces &amp; Eights
Aces &amp; Eights
