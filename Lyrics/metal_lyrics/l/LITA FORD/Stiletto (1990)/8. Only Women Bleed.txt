Man's got his woman
To take his seed
He got the power
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasin' up a man
She feeds his dinner on
Anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Man makes your hair grey
He's your life's mistake
All you're really looking for
Is an even break
He lies right at you
Ya know ya hate this game
Slaps you once in a while
And you live and love in pain
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Man's got his woman
To take his seed
He got the power
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasin' up a man
She feeds his dinner on
Anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Black eyes all of the time
Don't spend a dime, clean up this grime
And you there, down on your knees
Beggin' me please, come watch me bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
