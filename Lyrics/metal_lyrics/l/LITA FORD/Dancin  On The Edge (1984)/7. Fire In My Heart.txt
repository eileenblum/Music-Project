It's just another night
I stare at a star
I think about, I wonder how you are
I cannot escape you
No, I can't put out the fire in my heart
I don't feel shy, I'm not alone
But you're caught in my dreams, that's the way it seems
No matter how I try, I just can't put out the fire in my heart
Fire in my heart
One look in my eyes
And you'll realize
The fire in my heart
Is burnin' for you
Fire in my heart
The fire in my heart
Our hearts beat
Like thunder sings
You feel right
You know you're everything
No matter if we cry
We gotta turn around and walk our separate ways
The fire in my heart
One look in my eyes
And you'll realize
The fire in my heart
Is burnin' for you
The fire in my heart
The fire in my heart
It's just another night
I stare at a star
I think about, I wonder how you are
I cannot escape you
No, I can't put out the fire in my heart
The fire in my heart
One look in my eyes
And you'll realize
Fire in my heart
Is burnin' for you
The fire in my heart
The fire in my heart
The fire in my heart
