You're dressed to kill
Come a little closer, so I can look you in your eyes
So I can see what I been missing, so I can see through the disguise
You're dressed to kill
You got me in the sight of your gun, you're dressed to kill
Sell your soul to rock and roll
The only thing that thrills you
Evil grins as night begins
Gonna rock until it kills you
Learn to live fast
Learn to die young
Life's one big chase
You're caught in the race
You're never gonna slow down
You're dressed to kill
Kill me baby
You're never gonna let go
You're dressed to kill
You kill me baby
You're dressed to kill
Wake the dead with loud guitars
Screamin' in your head
An angel sings, fulfills the dreams
That are dancin' in your bed
Live for the danger
Die for the fun
Life's one big chase
You're caught in the race
You're never gonna slow down
You're dressed to kill
Kill me baby
You're never gonna let go
You're dressed to kill
You kill me baby
You're dressed to kill
You're dressed to kill
You're dressed to kill
Ahhhh, yeah
Kill me baby
You're dressed to kill
You kill me baby
You're dressed to kill
You're dressed to kill...
