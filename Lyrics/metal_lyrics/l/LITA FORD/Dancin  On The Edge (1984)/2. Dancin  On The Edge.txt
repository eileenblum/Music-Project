You're always runnin' for your life
But you can't escape, you fall deeper in hell
The devil's laughing at you
Your soul to take, and never tell

Wish you could see my love
Why don't you open your mind
But, I know it's hard for you
You're always dancin' on the edge
Dancin' on the edge
I see you standin' in the shadows
You smell of sex
Do you want more?
Cold and lonely in the dark
Lost on the avenue, what's it all for?
Can't you see I'm true
Why don't you open your mind
But I know it's hard for you
You're always dancin' on the edge
Dancin' on the edge
Hangin' on by death
Run for your life
You're dancin', dancin' on the edge
Dancin' on the edge
Dancin' on the edge
You're always runnin' for your life
But you can't escape, you fall deeper in Hell
The Devil's laughing at you
Your soul to take, and never tell
Wish you could see my love
Why don't you open your mind
But, I know it's hard for you
You're always dancin' on the edge
Dancin' on the edge
Hangin' on by death
Run for your life
You're dancin', dancin' on the edge
Dancin' on the edge
