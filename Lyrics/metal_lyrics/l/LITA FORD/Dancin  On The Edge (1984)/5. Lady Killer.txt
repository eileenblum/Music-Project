Crank It
He's got a heart of stone
Don't look him in the eye
He'll tuck you in
And then he'll whisper goodbye
He knows you'll come back beggin' for more
A ball of fire, a thunderbolt
Across the town, well, he could love 'em all
He's just a lady killer
I've been trying for so long to stay with you
If all hell breaks loose
I could never forget all the memories
I can't run away from you
Lady killer
Lady killer
He'll break your heart
And he'll break your dreams
A man o' war, he'll bring you to your knees
He knows you'll come back beggin' for more
He wants it all and he wants it now
He stands in my way, he says, "Lay down"
He's just a lady killer
I've been trying for so long to stay with you
If all hell breaks loose
I could never forget all the memories
I can't run away from you
Lady killer
Lady killer
Oh, put it in baby
Lady killer
Lady killer
Lady killer
Lady killer
Lady killer
Lady killer
