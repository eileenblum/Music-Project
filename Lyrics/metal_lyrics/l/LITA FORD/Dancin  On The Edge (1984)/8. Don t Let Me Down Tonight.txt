I'm so sad without you
I can't wait to see you again
I feel bad without you
I can't get you out of my head
So won't you come on home tonight
I'm gonna wait 'til the sun comes up
You're the only one in my life
So don't let me down...
Don't let me down tonight
Walk with me in the twilight
Don't let down tonight
Cause there's no one like you
So don't let me down tonight
You know I miss your face
I keep your photograph right by my bedside
You know I miss the way you that taste
I need you here with me at night
I'm gonna look you in the eyes
I want to hold you in my arms
I want to be with you tonight
So don't let me down...
Don't let me down tonight
Walk with me in the twilight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Cause there's no one like you
So don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Walk with me in the twilight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Cause there's no one like you
So don't let me down tonight
Standing down under a burning sky
Flames shines bright in my eyes
It only shines when I look at you
It leaves me with just a smile
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me down tonight
Don't let me
