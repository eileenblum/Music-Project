You're like a runaway train
As you go speeding down lovers lane
You're heart's so blind when you get behind the wheel
That you can't see the love I feel
You say you're such a sensitive guy
Well, you're the one who's gonna cry
Hit 'n' run
On your love
Everyone knows it's true
Hit 'n' run
On your love
That's all I want to do
Hit your love
And runaway
Yeah, ah, runaway
You've been out on the street
You're making promises that you don't keep
Well, it don't matter if you make me cry
You're just a casualty of love gone by
I don't care if the street light is red
I'll just drive on straight ahead
Hit 'n' run
On your love
Everyone knows it's true
Hit 'n' run
On your love
That's all I want to do
Hit 'n' run
On your love
Everyone knows it's true
Hit your love
And runaway
Yeah, ah, runaway
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
Hit 'n' run
