You walk tall, you act proud
Leave the little girls cryin' out loud
You got it all, it's not enough
When it comes to love, babe you're outta luck
Yeah, I know I'm a fool
Tryin' to find a way to get next to you
I wanna tie myself to your bed of fire
But you'll only cut me loose once you had enough
Tell me, what do you know about love?
Spreadin' yourself all over town
What do you know about love?
There's a lot more to it than lyin' down
Your mind's tickin', your heart stop
Your eyes are ice cold, your lips are red hot
Little lies that you do
Whispered like an Angel straight from Hell
Live wire, short fuse
Walkin' detonator in snakeskin boots
You're a bad mistake but I can't wait to make you
I'm gonna shake you from your sleepwalk in the dark
Hey, what do you know about love?
With your dirty mind and your heart of stone
What do you know about love?
You got a lot of friends but you're all alone
How can you run from the truth?
Spreadin' yourself all over town
What do you know about love?
There's a lot more to it than lyin' down
The day will come, you take a long hard look in the mirror
And your pretty face starts to look a little rough
What do you know about love?
What do you know about love?
How can you run from the truth?
Baby, baby, run away, yeah
What do you know about love?
With your dirty mind and your heart of stone
What do you know about love?
You got a lot of friends but you're all alone
How can you run from the truth?
Spreadin' yourself all over town
What do you know about love?
There's a lot more to it than lyin' down
What do you know about love?
What do you know about love?
What do you know about love?
