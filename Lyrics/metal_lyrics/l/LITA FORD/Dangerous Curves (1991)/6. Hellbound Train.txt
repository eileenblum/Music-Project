Bad luck and trouble
Crashin' through my veins
And I ain't bound for glory
There's a devil in my brain
Got a fistful of whiskey, a suitcase full of sin
An' there's a thousand nasty habits
Underneath my skin
We can fly on wings of the flames
Comin' down hard, only yourself to blame
Playin' so tough in a deadly game
Ain't that a shame
Goin' down tonight on a Hellbound train
Goin' down tonight on a Hellbound train
I'm a speed demon baby, movin' way too fast
You put a dagger through my soul
But you'll never kick my ass, oh, no
We can fly on the wings of the flames
Comin' down hard, only yourself to blame
Playin' so tough in a deadly game
Ain't that a shame
Goin' down tonight on a Hellbound train
Goin' down tonight on a Hellbound train
Goin' down tonight, I'm Hellbound
Ain't good for nothin', nothing's what I crave
I'm your Angel of Darkness
And I'll see you in Hell one day
We can fly on the wings of the flames
Comin' down hard, only yourself to blame
Playin' so tough in a deadly game
Ain't that a shame
Goin' down tonight on a Hellbound train
Goin' down tonight on a Hellbound train
Goin' down tonight, I'm Hellbound
On a Hellbound train
