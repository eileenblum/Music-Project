Sail away, my crystal ship
'Cross the diamond sea
Hear the sweet song of a morning star
On a distant tambourine
I could hear a heart of thunder
Callin' me from across the lonely sea tonight
The spell that I'm under
Has brought you to my door, the love I hunger for
Won't you be my tambourine dream
We can last forever in a lover's fantasy
I want you to be my tambourine dream
Wrap your arms around me, baby, come along with me
I'll sing you a sweet melody, yeah
Stranger come, one sleepless night
Built a castle 'round my heart
Music man from another land, far beyond the stars
When the morning came a knockin'
Kissed my lips and slipped away into the mist
Heard a gypsy song callin'
Just close your eyes tonight
I'll be there by your side
Won't you be my tambourine dream
We can last forever in a lover's fantasy
I want you to be my tambourine dream
Wrap your arms around me, baby, come along with me
I'll sing you a sweet melody, yeah
Won't you be my tambourine dream
We can last forever in a lover's fantasy
I want you to be my tambourine dream
Wrap your arms around me, baby, come along with me
Tamborine dream
I want you to be my tambourine dream
We can last forever in a lover's fantasy
I want you to be my tambourine dream
Wrap your arms around me, baby, come along, come along with me
Tamborine dream
Tamborine dream
Tamborine dream
Tamborine dream
Tamborine dream, yeah
And I'm dreamin' tonight
Tamborine dream
Dream tonight, yeah
Tamborine dream
