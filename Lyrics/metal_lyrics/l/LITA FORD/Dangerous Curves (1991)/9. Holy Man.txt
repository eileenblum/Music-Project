Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
Flames in the Garden of Eden
Heaven in pieces at my feet
I faced the raging ruin
Of a million sleepless nights
I need to rest my weary head
On your resurrection bed
Storms across the horizon
Whirlwind tuggin' at my sleeve
Just when my heart was turning
To an icy shade of blue
You came into the night
Held me so close
How the hell ya found me
God only knows
Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
Lies in the Valley of Evil
Like shadows fallin' 'cross my eyes
When there's no sanctuary
You came and turned the storms away
You made the darkest night in my life
Into Judgement Day
Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
I see forever in your eyes
For your love
I would make any sacrifice, yeah
Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
Lead me into temptation
Save me with your healing hands
Show me the fires of creation
Baby be my holy man
