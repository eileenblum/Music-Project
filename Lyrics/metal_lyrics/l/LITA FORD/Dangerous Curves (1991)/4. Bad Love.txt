Wake up now darlin'
I got a reason to believe
This love ain't gonna last the night
You've opened my eyes, now I'm a little bit wiser
A little bite colder
There's no easy way
To let you down and tell you
I don't love you anymore
Have a little respect, don't beg
I don't need it, I never wanted it anyway
So stop what you're saying
It's more than I can take
We've reached the end, there's no defense
I had enough of this bad, bad, love
Yeah
Don't fool yourself
I could never forgive you
And I damn sure won't forget ya
In Heaven or Hell every tear that I've cried
Will come back to haunt you yet
Don't be surprised if one of these mornings
Bad luck comes knockin' at your door
Oh, no, you'll find out
Hell hath no fury like this woman that you've scorned
Stop, don't say it
It's more than I can take
We've reached the end, there's no defense
I've had enough of this bad love
Don't be surprised
If one of these mornings
Bad luck comes knockin' at your door
Have a little respect, don't beg
I don't need it, it doesn't matter anymore
Stop, don't say it
Don't try to make me see
We've reached the end, there's no defense
I had enough of this bad, bad, love
