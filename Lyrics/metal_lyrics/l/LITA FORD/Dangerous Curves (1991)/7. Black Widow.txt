Spider web stockings
At the pearly gates
Ruby lips, Revlon kiss
Born to seal your fate
Beautiful and deadly
Making love in a suicide bed
Once you taste that poison, darling, you're dead
Catch you in those dark eyes
Steal your breath away
Black Widow
The curse on her calls your name
To this wicked game called love
Black Widow
Though you know her kisses kill
You can't resist that deadly thrill
Black Widow
Long legs squeeze you tight
Hold you for one endless night
Her touch is cold, her bite is deep
She's everything you'll ever need
Catch you in those dark eyes
Steal your life away
Black Widow
The curse on her calls your name
To this wicked game called love
Black Widow
Though you know her kisses kill
You can't resist that deadly thrill
Black Widow
Comin' outta the dark, hey
Black Widow
Goin' straight for your heart, hey, Black Widow
Widow
Ha, yeah
The curse on her calls your name
To this wicked game called love
Black Widow
Though you know her kisses kill
You can't resist that deadly thrill
Black Widow
Comin' outta the dark, hey
Black Widow
Goin' straight for your heart, hey, Black Widow
Widow
