Look into my eyes and tease me
What am I supposed to do
I should try and run just as far as I can get from you
Your love feels so very easy
Nothin' I can say to you
I better turn away before you melt me right through
'Cause I was born just a little too early
You came along just a little too late
We hang around just a little bit longer
Somebody's heart is gonna break
It's gonna break
Standing on the edge of willing
All you gotta do is touch me right
Every time you do what you do, it gets so hard to fight
The magic in your eyes is true
If I could only look away
I'm beggin' you to leave so I won't have to beg you to stay
'Cause I was born just a little too early
You came along just a little too late
We hang around just a little bit longer
Somebody's heart is gonna break
It's gonna break
The magic in your eyes is true
If I could only look away
I'm beggin' you to leave so I won't have to beg you to stay
I won't have to beg you to stay
'Cause I was born just a little too early
You came along just a little too late
If we hang around just a little bit longer
Somebody's heart is gonna break
I was born just a little too early
You came along just a little too late
We hang around just a little bit longer
Somebody's heart is gonna break
I was born just a little too early
You came along just a little too late
We hang around just a little bit longer
Somebody's heart is gonna break
