I hate you and you hate me,
What's your darkest fantasy?

Maybe you don't want the truth (truth)?
I tried, I tried, I tried,
But I can't live without you!
It's making me blue!
I tried, I tried, I tried,
I tried, I tried, tried!
I give my love to you!
Everything I have to give
I give it to you!
You! And ONLY YOU!
Take it, don't you fake it
'cause I'll break you (break you, break you...)!

Garden of Eden, take a bite.
Do me evil all damn night.
Sinful thoughts run trough your brain.
And I'll ask, you'll decide, drives you insane.

Maybe you don't want the truth (truth)?
I tried, I tried, I tried,
But I can't live without you!
It's making me blue!
I tried, I tried, I tried,
I tried, I tried, tried!
I give my love to you!
Everything I have to give
I give it to you!
You! And ONLY YOU!
Take it, don't you fake it
'cause I'll break you (break you, break you...)!

I hate you (I hate you)
And you hate me...(you hate me)
What's your darkest... fantasy?

Maybe you don't want the truth (truth)?
I tried, I tried, I tried,
But I can't live without you!
It's making me blue!
I tried, I tried, I tried,
I tried, I tried, tried!
I give my love to you!
Everything I have to give
I give it to you!
You! And ONLY YOU!
Take it, don't you fake it
'cause I'll break you (break you, break you...)!

Just tell me the truth.
Just tell me the truth.
Just tell me the truth. (the truth, the truth)

Just tell me the truth.
Just tell me the truth. (the truth, the truth)

Just tell me the truth.
Just tell me the truth. (the truth, the truth)
