Sweat drips off your bodies
Breathing hard insanity
Tie you to the crucifix
Perverted blasphemy
Whips 'n' chains will please you
I will have my way
I feel the need, I need the feel
You're my slave today, hey!

Welcome to my Wicked Wonderland
Use you in my Wicked Wonderland
On your knees, submit to me mmmmmmm, do it

I feel the need to conquer you
Body, soul and brain
No limits, nothing's sacred
You'll find pleasure in your pain
Sac religious give you more
Razor, blade, delight
Your screams will go unanswered
Your ass is mine tonight, hey!

Welcome to my Wicked Wonderland
Use you in my Wicked Wonderland
Come inside my Wicked Wonderland
Screamin' in my Wicked Wonderland

Taboo? Fetish? It's so sweet....

Welcome to my Wicked Wonderland
Use you in my Wicked Wonderland
Come inside my Wicked Wonderland
Screamin' in my Wicked Wonderland
