Spread 'em baby
I'm a devil woman burnin' hot you wanna lick my fire
Lay you on my bed of nails
I feel your desire

I've got a heaven in my hell prisoner of pain
Gimme your soul do it now sweet suffering
I'll show you how
Tie me to the bed
Tie me to the bed
Tie me to the bed

Spank me cause I like it
Bed bed bed

My soul is haunted dancin' with the devil
(Dancing with the devil)
Trust my discipline
(I've been such a bad boy)
Hate is love - love is hate
Open your mind, I penetrate

Tie me to the bed
(Tie me to the bed)
Make my eyes roll up in my head
(Tie me to the bed)

The break of dawn is what I always dread
Bed

Tie me to the bed
(Tie me to the bed)
Bow your head when you approach your queen
Tie me to the bed
You give me pleasure with pain and always make me scream
Bed
Tie me to the bed
(Tie me to the bed)
Triple X terror and that ain't go threat (Tie me to the bed)
I've been under you spell since the day that we met
Bed
