You and me, that's how it supposed to be
I know I know it's your destiny
I want to give you everything
You do you do - you leave me wanting nothing
Nothing at all is off limits between us
Your wish is my command
Yeah you're the best
My body is yours
Your body's a temple
Worship me
I always do
Yes you do
Do you want some more
You know it
Open another door
Or bust through it
Whatever it takes
Yeah baby do it
Gimme your sugar
Do me Big Daddy!

Indulge in me
Indulge in you
Indulge in you
Indulge in me
Indulge in you
Indulge in me

Together forever
Forever together
Indulge

Take your clothes off naked bare your soul
Naked naked I want to feel you
I want to taste your goddess flesh
My love my love dripping off your face
I penetrate you
Slide it in
Your wish is my command
Sweet evil
My body is yours
Go Big Daddy

Indulge in me
Indulge in you
Indulge in you
Indulge in me
Indulge in you
Indulge in me
Together forever
Forever together
Indulge
Indulge in you forever
