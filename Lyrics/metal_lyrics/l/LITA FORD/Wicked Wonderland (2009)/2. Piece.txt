36' 24' 36' that's right
Long blonde hair and a body that's tight
Got my guitar play it loud as hell
When the boys watch me play their privates start to swell
Everybody wants it yes they do
Everybody wants it and so do you

Everybody wants a piece of me
Baby I can read your mind
Woo woo woo - woo woo woo
If you want it say hell yeah (HELL YEAH)
Everybody wants a piece of me baby
Make you lose your mind
Woo woo woo - woo woo woo
If you want is say hell yeah (HELL YEAH)

I'm the real deal with sex appeal
I rock this guitar - I play with feel
Dangerous curves with a deadly kiss
With looks like this how could I miss
Poppin' like a Cherry Bomb almost obscene
Rock-n-Roll royalty bow to your Queen
Every body wants it mmm you damn right
Cause the bitch is back - gonna rock you tonight

Everybody wants a piece of me
Baby I can read your mind
Woo woo woo - woo woo woo
If you want it say hell yeah (HELL YEAH)
Everybody wants a piece of me baby
Make you lose your mind
Woo woo woo - woo woo woo
If you want is say hell yeah (HELL YEAH)

Lookin' at you lookin' at me this ass in my mans
And so is my pu... (meaw)
6 foot 2 - 275 if you try to couch this he'll skin you alive
Full of tattoos and trained to kill he don't wanna hurt you
But trust me he will
Bow down in a trance - hypnotized you sucker
I'm a freak a fiend a nasty bitch yeah I'm a Mother Trucker

Everybody wants a piece of me
Baby I can read your mind
Woo woo woo - woo woo woo
If you want it say hell yeah (HELL YEAH)
Everybody wants a piece of me baby
Make you lose your mind
Woo woo woo - woo woo woo
If you want is say hell yeah (HELL YEAH)
