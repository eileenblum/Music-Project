I love the way you look when I'm down on my knees
You call me sugar mama and you always say please
Whatever you want the kinkier the better
But it's only kinky once baby go get the leather
The handcuffs, blindfold, spank me I'm a bad girl
Good boy just like that gonna use the enjoy
(gotta use the enjoy, gotta use the enjoy)

I love to love you (I love to love you)
You love me so good
In burns burns me deep inside
I love to hate you (I love to hate you)
You hate me so hood
It burns burns me deep inside

1 soul for 2 bodies lover we'll never die
Infatuation sweet temptation makes us so hugh
My soulmate tantra king sticky sweet
Love every inch of your body gonna start with your feet
You're my god, I worship you every night
Gimme your nectar big daddy just right
Erotic fetish deep desire gotta let go
I'm your prisoner of love and baby you're in control

I love to love you (I love to love you)
You love me so good
In burns burns me deep inside
I love to hate you (I love to hate you)
You hate me so hood
It burns burns me deep inside

Love turns to hate turns to love turns to hate
One in the same one in the same
Hate turns to love turns to hate turns to love
One in the same, one in the same
Big Daddy burn me deep inside
