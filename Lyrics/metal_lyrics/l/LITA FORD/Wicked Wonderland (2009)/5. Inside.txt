Looking in the mirror
Don't necessarily
Like what I see
When you are staring at me
Do you think you know who
This person is are you right
Where you want to be
Believe in yourself
In yourself

Feel you from the inside
My souls is burning for you
Feel me from the inside
Inside you's where I wanna be
Feel me from the inside
My soul's on fire for you
Feel you from inside
The inside the inside

On a dream to nowhere
A wicked fantasy
Just you and me, just you and me
That's how I want it to be
Close your eyes forever
I'll always be by your side
Right where you want me
And I want you

Feel you from the inside
My soul is burning for you
Feel me from the inside
Inside you's where I wanna be
Feel me from the inside
My soul's on fire for you
Feel you from inside
The inside the inside

Feel me, feel me inside
Feel me, feel me inside

Feel you from the inside
My soul is burning for you
Feel me from the inside
Inside you's where I wanna be
Feel me from the inside
My soul's on fire for you
Feel you from inside
The inside the inside

I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna feel you baby
I wanna feel you baby
I wanna feel you from the inside
Inside, inside, inside
