With my voice I hypnotize
I'm so erotic
Aching like psychopath
You are so neurotic

You're pretty oh so pretty
But you're a train wreck oh it's such a pity
Sinful thoughts inside my head
You scream for me and I'll scream for you

You're crazy oh so crazy
And you're insane a brain drain a freight train
You're oh so dangerous
You scream for me and I'll scream for you

I am a freak, a freak like you
Tell me just 1 little thing
What's a freak supposed to do
If you want it I got it
I got it you want it

Stand up sweet misery
You crave it I got it
I got what you crave
Stand up and scream for me

You're pretty oh so pretty
But you're a train wreck oh it's such a pity
Sinful thoughts inside my head
You scream for me and I'll scream for you

You're crazy oh so crazy
And you're insane a brain drain a freight train
You're oh so dangerous
You scream for me and I'll scream for you

I'll scream for you you you
Scream for me, scream for me
I'll scream for you you you
