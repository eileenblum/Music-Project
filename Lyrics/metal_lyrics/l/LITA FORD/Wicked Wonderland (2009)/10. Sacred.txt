Till death do us part ain't long enough
But the hallmark cards say all that stuff
I just wanted to say you're so special
So sacred to me
Loves not a big enough word
To tell you how I feel
I'll spend eternity
Showing you what you mean to me
You so sacred you're so sacred to me
When I look in your eyes I see so much
I feel your heart beat when we touch
You are my best friend my angel
So sacred to me
Loves not a big enough word
So I wrote this song for you
I'll spend eternity
Loving you faithfully
You're so sacred you're so sacred to me
Sacred Sacred
You're so sacred to me
Sacred Sacred
You're so sacred to me
The answer to my prayers
My every fantasy
My soul is yours eternity
My love matched only by my loyalty
My Love I live for you
God knows I'd die for you
Loves not a big enough word
So I wrote this song for you
I'll spend eternity
Loving you faithfully
Sacred Sacred
You're so sacred to me
Sacred Sacred
You're so sacred to me
Sacred Sacred
You're so sacred to me
