The red white n blue for you and me
The greatest nation that will ever be
We got everything that you can desire
We got the fire
Freedom

I'm a sinner a sinner (oh I'm a sinner)
You're a knock down drag it out patriotic Son of a Bitch
(1 patriotic S.O.B.)
Sick like you sick like me mentally deranged and totally free
I'm a sinner a sinner
Sin for me

We're all freaks in our own way
Playboy was born in the USA
United we're strong divided they fall
The best lookin' women boy we got 'em all
If sin's so bad why's it so much fun
Sweet porno superstar the right to own a gun
Freedom of speech and all of that sh... (BEEP)
Spank you cause you like it baby tight it barely fit

I'm a sinner a sinner (oh I'm a sinner)
You're a knock down drag it out patriotic Son of a Bitch
(1 patriotic S.O.B.)
Sick like you sick like me mentally deranged and totally free
I'm a sinner a sinner
Sin for me

Sin for me
Shake it darlin'
Sin for me
Shake it darlin'

Firecracker poppin' on the 4th of July
Wet T-shirt Beauty Queen
Sweet as apple pie
I'm surfin' the net baby
lookin' for some porn
We can do that here - the best place to be born
I'm a revolution maker punk talkin' my smack
I got millions of Americans and they got my back
Yeah I'm a sinner and so are you
Stars and stripes baby and the red white and blue!

I'm a sinner a sinner (oh I'm a sinner)
You're a knock down drag it out patriotic Son of a Bitch
(1 patriotic S.O.B.)
Sick like you sick like me mentally deranged and totally free
I'm a sinner a sinner
Sin for me

Sin sin I'm full of sin
Bang bang shoot 'em up

Win win gonna win today
Winnin' we're the best we're the US of A
Sin sin red white and blue

And so are you
Sin sin gonna sin today
Sinning' cause we like it in the US of A
