Caught up in the circle
Crazy in my heat
You know I'll love you
'Till the end - the end

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is great

Love hate desired fate

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is great

My love won't make you wait

Never but always
Inside out and upside down
Nowhere but everywhere
Makes me high even when I feel down

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is great

Every little thing you love
Love to hate desired fate

Every little thought inside your brain is about me
Twisted turning most concerning you love to hate me
I'm everything that's good and everything that's bad
But baby you know I'm the best you ever had

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is great

Love hate desired fate
Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is great

My love won't make you wait

Everything you love
Everything
Everything you hate
Everything you love
Everything
Don't you hesitate - oh yeah
