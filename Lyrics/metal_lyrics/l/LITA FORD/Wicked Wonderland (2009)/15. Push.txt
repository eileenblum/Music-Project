Don't need time,
Don't need your money
All I need is your sweet, sweet honey.

You're so hot
And you go so slow
The way you do it
I loose control.

Push, Push, feels so tight
You're in my mind
And you move just right.
Push, Push, take your time
You'll get yours after I get mine

I've got the need,
Give me your pleasure.
I've got the hot spot,
Come bury your treasure.
You do it best,
You do it right.
Take me around the world
Every night.

Push, Push, feels so tight
You're in my mind
And you move just right.
Push, Push, take your time
You'll get yours after I get mine.
Push, Push, don't be shy
Give me what I need
Or I think I'll die.
Push, Push, yeah just like that
You know how to please my pussy,
My pussycat.

Push, Push (Push, Push)
Push, Push (Push, Push)

Push it baby, drive it on home.
Lick it like you lick an ice cream cone.
From the front to the back to the left to the right.
Please that pussycat, stroke it all night.

Push, Push, feels so tight

And you move just right.
Push, Push, take your time

Push, Push, don't be shy

Or I think I'll die.
Push, Push, yeah just like that
You know how to please my pussy,
My pussycat.

Push it baby, drive it on home.
Lick it like you lick an ice cream cone.
From the front, to the back, to the left to the right
Please that pussycat, stroke it all night.
