Crawling by the sea of black tears give your soul to me
My man is gone betrayed I don't want your sympathy,
She is the ruler of this world your know.
You're so predictable now give her your soul
1, 2, 3, 4
Betrayal running through my veins.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
I am in the underworld, underworld, underworld.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
The fear in your eye I'm the lump in your throat.
The shiver down your spine you're so devoted.
Come join the army of undead and obscene.
She'll give you nothing because that's all you need.
Betrayal running through my veins.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
I am in the underworld, underworld, underworld.
The BRUTAL LEGEND brutal pain.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
Betrayal running through my veins.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
I am in the underworld, underworld, underworld.
The BRUTAL LEGEND brutal pain.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
Wicked Wonderland, Wicked Wonderland
