When the river don't run
And the night won't fall
When I fear the touch
Of the highway's call
When I close my eyes
And the dreams won't come
When the world has set me free
Will you still be with me?
My Loverman
When the moon turns red
And the sun burns black
When the reaper's whip
Falls across my back
Will you lay me down
On a bed of stone
In that long and silent sleep
Will you be with me?
What if I just go flying away?
What would you say?
Would you wait a million years?
Would you cry a million tears for me?
Or would you take my hand?
Would you fly away with me?
Would you be with me?
Loverman
When the hour glass is broken
And the final word is spoken
When fate has lost it's power
This word will still be ours
Loverman
Oh, my Loverman
Yeah
What if I just go flying away?
What would you say?
Would you steal me from the cold?
Would you lead me to my soul again?
And when we reach the end, when we face eternity
Would you be with me, my Loverman?
Oh, Loverman
Yeah
When the river don't run
And the night won't fall
When I fear the touch
Of the highway's call
When I close my eyes
And the dreams won't come
And the world has set me free, yeah
When the moon turns red
And the sun burns black
When the reaper's whip
Across my back
Will you lay me down
Will you lay me down
On a bed of stone
In that long and silent sleep
Loverman
Loverman
Oh, Loverman.
