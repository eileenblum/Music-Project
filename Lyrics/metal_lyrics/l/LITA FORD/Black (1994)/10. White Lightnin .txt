I was born to a gypsy woman
With lightnin' crashing all around my crib
Doctor took one look, he started runnin'
He got two steps an' lightnin' struck him dead
The wind was howlin' like the devil come knockin'
The house came down, the cradle was rockin'
He called out for a hoodoo man
With a rock 'n' roll attitude
He made a sign with his mo-jo hand
And the lightnin' done struck him blue
I jumped out of that cradle
Grabbed a black cat bone and said
"Mama, don't you worry, I was born to storm."
When lightnin' strikes and the walls fall down
I'm a wild cat, baby, when the thunder sounds
When lightnin' strikes, white lightnin'
And double or nothin'
Baby, pull my switch
I got a six string hammer
Gonna scratch this itch
I'm a white witch, honey
With long blonde hair
Won't you step into my 'lectric chair
When lightnin' strikes and the walls fall down
I'm a wild cat, baby, when the thunder sounds
When lightnin' strikes, white lightnin'
White, White Lightnin'
White, White Lightnin'
White, White Lightnin'
Comin' at you tonight, comin' at you tonight, comin' at you
When lightnin' strikes and the walls fall down
I'm a white witch, honey, when the thunder sounds
When lightnin' strikes and the walls fall down
I'm a wild cat, baby, when the thunder sounds
When lightnin' strikes, white lightnin'
Lightnin' strikes, white lightnin'
Yeah, rock me right outta my crib
Put on the floor, hah, I almost cracked open my head
Whoa, baby
