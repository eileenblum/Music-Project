I found hunger in the fields of plenty
I found freedom in a ball and chain
I found madness in the voice of reason
I found mercy at the hangman's gate
I've held the world in the palm of my hand
And watched as it slipped through my fingers like sand
Here I am alone again
Where do I turn
When all I see around me is a lie?
If I close my eyes
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I know all my dreams have fallen on hard times
And I'm so cold inside
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I found peace in the heat of the battle
I found treason in the eyes of a friend
I found hate in the words of a preacher
I found fortune in a beggar's hands
I close my eyes and pray for the light
To guide my way
Into the night, I fall
And the world is crashin' down around my soul
Why do I turn
When all I see around me is a lie?
If I close my eyes
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I know all my dreams have fallen on hard times
And I'm so cold inside
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I have searched a thousand years
Through the darkness and the tears
And I don't think I can take another night
Without you here
Where do I turn
When all I see around me is a lie?
If I close my eyes
Where will I find my heart tonight?
I know all my dreams have fallen on hard times
And I'm so cold inside
Where will I find my heart tonight?
Where will I find my heart tonight?
