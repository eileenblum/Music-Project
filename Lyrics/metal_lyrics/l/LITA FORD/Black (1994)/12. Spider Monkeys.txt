I'm a Spider Monkey, baby
Gonna crawl all over you
I'm a Spider Monkey, baby
Gonna crawl all over you
And I'm gonna love you, baby
This spider monkey do, oh, yeah
I've been swingin' in this jungle
Ever since I was a child
I've been swingin' in this jungle
Ever since I was a baby child
And I'm gonna wait for you darlin'
Come and join me in the wild
I'm a Spider Monkey, baby
Just can't keep me down
I'm a Spider Monkey, baby
Never touch the ground
Won't you swing with me, honey
Down in Spider Monkey town
I'm a Spider Monkey, baby
Gonna get you in my tree
I'm a Spider Monkey, sugar
I'm gonna get you in my tree
Come on, sweet baby
Do that monkey thing with me
Spider Monkey, baby
Oh, yeah
Spider Monkey
I'm a Spider Monkey, baby
I'll get you in my tree.
