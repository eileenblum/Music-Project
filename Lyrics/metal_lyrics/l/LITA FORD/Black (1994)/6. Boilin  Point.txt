Caught in the sights of a killin' fire
On streets filled with ashes and smoke
Flames reaching up to a dirty sky
Like some kind of sick deadly joke
Can't stop what hate started
There's no coolin' down
I'm past the Boilin' Point now
Every day my TV screen
Is pushin' me to make somebody bleed
The chains 'round your neck got me wonderin'
How you'll ever get the freedom that you need
Can't turn this world into heaven
By burning it down to the ground
I'm on fire
I'm burnin' up
My temperature's risin', point of no return
Watch out or you just might burn
Can't stop what hate started
There's no coolin' down
I'm past the Boilin' Point now
The walls fall down like dominoes
Nobody's left to pay what's due
Too many crazy people runnin' 'round
Starting wars between me and you
Can't stop what love started
Can't bring us down
We're past the Boilin' Point now
I'm on fire
I'm burnin' up
My temperature's risin', point of no return
Watch out or you just might burn
