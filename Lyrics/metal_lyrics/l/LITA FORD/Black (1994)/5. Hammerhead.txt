He sees himself as a warrior
In a world that doesn't understand
A demon light fills the eyes
Of this mechanical man
He's a living, breathing nightmare
He's twisted and he's mean
In his head, the walking dead
Are his war secret machine
Oh, Hammerhead
He was just a lonely boy
Before the demons took control
His sanity, humanity
Lost somewhere long ago
Now the poisons in his memory
Are clogging up his veins
And the loneliness like a devil's kiss
Has gone straight to his brain
Oh, Hammerhead
Oh, Hammerhead
Now he's lost within his madness
And more and more each day
The metal man turns his hand
To the price the world must pay
Hammerhead
Oh, Hammerhead
Oh, Hammerhead
