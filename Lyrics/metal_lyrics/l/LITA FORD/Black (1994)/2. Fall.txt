Words are spoken
Swallowed in vain
Slowly, I'm chokin'
I cough it up, cough it up, cough it up again
Familiar, familiar
Laughin', laughin' at the man who
Never had a chance to dream your dreams
Find it funny here today, you know
But, if by tomorrow
You might wonder then
Why your seeds are weeds
Familiar, familiar
Familiar, is it familiar?
Open up
There's a river in us all
Open up
From the cradle where we crawl
Open up
It's so unusual
Open up
'Cause sittin' on the wall
Everybody's got to
Fall
Oh, show me
Show me a reason
A reason for, anything I see
Round and round and round and round, we go
What happened to my brother?
Will his flowers wither?
Just like me, yeah
Familiar, familiar
Familiar, is it familiar?
Open up
There's a river in us all
Open up
From the cradle where we crawl
Open up
It's so unusual
Open up
While you're sittin' on the wall
Everybody's got to
Fall, yeah
I am no preacher
I know no teachings
Sway my mind, dear
With your primal screechings
Buried under
Your plastic cover
You are me
And I am you
Open up There's a river in us all
Open up
From the cradle where we crawl
Open up
It's so unusual
Open up
Yeah, yeah
Open up
There's a river in us all
Open up
From the cradle where we crawl
Open up
It's so unusual
Open up
'Cause while you're sittin' on the wall
Everybody's got to
Fall
Everybody's got to
Fall
Everybody's got to
Fall
