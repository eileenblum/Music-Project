She runs through the streets
So desperately young
Her eyes aflame
And her mind undone
She aches for the songs
That will never be sung
And the heroes so quickly forgotten
She sees a friend
In the church yard light
Laughin' and jokin'
And talkin' to the sky
Shots ring out
And he hits the ground
He never opens his eyes
And she cries
Heaven is closed to the angels below
Streets of gold are now paved with sorrow
God only knows what happens to love
When the innocence is gone
And the war of the angels has begun
The ghosts in her head
Have faces and names
They're soldiers and children
All one in the same
In the streets and the alleys
Hear the battle cries sound
And the angels run for cover
As the world comes tumbling down
All through the night the battle is fought
They can never win back the lives they've lost
Down on her knees, in the tear stained dawn
She just closes her eyes and whispers goodbye
Heaven is closed to the angels below
Streets of gold are now paved with sorrow
God only knows what happens to love
When the innocence is gone
And the war of the angels is never won
Another day in the neighborhood
Better dry your eyes and be off to school
She packs her lunch and her daddy's gun
Seems much too old to be so young
The battle begins the day that you're born
Into this world, so heartsick and war torn
Somebody better come and carry her away
Maybe this angel will live...
To fly again someday
Heaven is closed to the angels below
Streets of gold are now paved with sorrow
God only knows what happens to love
When the innocence is gone
And the war of the angels rages on
Rages on
Oh, yeah, yeah
