She was born on a dead end street
Half a mile from the freeway sign
Growing up in a house that was never a home, all alone
She never had too much to say, it didn't matter anyway
Ain't no one to hear you when your on your own, oh no
And the road gets longer, as the night goes on
Now your running yet your crying
Falling faster then you fly
And the demons just beside you
Come swift and wild when your nobody's child
There's a heartache like the devil at your side
And the danger is the dark and lonely night
When your nobody's child
He was raised as an army brat
He never stayed in one place too long
Moving town to town he never knew a soul
Had nothing to show but Mama left when he was a boy
His Dad said better act your age
One night he just walked away alone
Now he's long gone
And the road gets longer, as life goes on
Now your running yet your crying
Falling faster then you fly
And the demons just beside you
Come swift and wild when your nobody's child
There's a heartache like the devil at your side
And the danger is the dark and lonely night
When your nobody's child
Some people get lucky
And thats the way it goes
And some people never find their way back home
Now your running yet your crying
Falling faster then you fly
And the demons just beside you
Come swift and wild when your nobody's child
There's a heartache like the devil at your side
And the danger is the dark and lonely night
When your nobody's child
