Hey, can you turn it up a little louder, please
Marlon Brando on a motorbike
In the black leather heat of a Saturday night
He said, "Whaddaya got?"
Ya got nothin'
Dollar in my pocket burnin' like Rome
There ain't no place that I call home
All alone in the big bad city
Hang around this town, man you're better off dead
I'm flyin' like a rebel flag, goin' outta my head
Yeah, we're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna tear it up twice
Shake it up, break it up, tear it down, larger than life
I love the city when the sun goes down
It's a madhouse, baby, a real 'toon town
Whaddaya want
Ya wanna rocket
I take a picture, paint it black and white
And the neon burnin' like a new tattoo
Ready or not, here we come, uh, huh
Hang around this town, man you're better off dead
Flyin' like a rebel flag, goin' outta my head
Yeah, we're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna tear it up twice
Shake it up, break it up, tear it down, larger than life
Yeah, we're gonna rock it tonight
We're gonna jam it uptight
Jack it up, rip it off, tear it down, larger than life
We're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna tear it up twice
Shake it up, break it up, tear it down, larger than life
Yeah, we're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna tear it up twice
Jack it up, rip it off, tear it down, larger than life
We're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna rocket tonight, night, night, night
Tear it down
Larger than life
Larger
Than life
