Gotta love for destruction
Gotta feel for danger tonight
Hey, Mr. Moonlight won't you follow me down
I need the company
Everybody tells me you're no good
That's all right with me
Gimme one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
Come on baby, poison me
Gotta hunger for fatal attraction
I'm savin' all my passion for you
I gotta heartbreak habit that I can't kick
Only you can ease the pain
I'm a midnight animal tryin' to score
Before I go insane
Gimme me one shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
One shot of poison
A little taste of paradise
One drop of your sweet poison
Satisfies
Give me one last kiss before I die
I'm flyin' high
On your love, tonight, baby
One shot of poison
A little twist is all I need
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
One shot of poison
A little taste of paradise
One drop of your sweet poison
Satisfies
One shot of poison
Come on, baby, poison me
One drop of your sweet poison
Sets me free
One shot
