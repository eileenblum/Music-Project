The Almighty one came and ruled the land.
Settled his kingdom behind a lustful aerie
And he became one with the land.
The years strengthen his domain but slowly stole his life
Until that day she appeared to him
The lady who will be the bride of his brother
That shouldn't be
She is the one who must belong to him
There must be a way to cover her.
The darkness told me the only way to obtain my one and only.
It's offering a damnation for my soul
I signed...
Blood, A whole fountain of it
Life, If I dared to take it
As my own life ebbed I didn't dare not take it.
I drink deeply, And lived... again.
Now Obviously I am the one who will rule the night
And the wolves are my regency.
Vespers has lost their meanings
The mists covered my cursed land.
A single tear fell to the ethereal dirt for my victim
And I lost my love.
Grievous blood of the bride painted rivers to red
The sky came down falling apart
Bloodshed took hold of the fortress
Massacred life itself
Leaving his domain all alone in the gloom
Memory of that night will never forsake him
And now everyone will obey his justice
I can hear the pulse of the night so violent
I shrieked my loathe to the empyrean...
