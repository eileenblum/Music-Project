When I was reborn to an eternal life
I opened my eyes to a night
Where the sun never turned to me again
They gave me a kingdom of darkness
But I never wanted a life which took on other lives
How come my eternal life fed on blood?
All the beauties in my life get pale.
Darkness and thirst is slowly conquering me
Although I still miss the sunlight.
The great dilemma in my life drives me insane
Poems of angels repeat your name
Hear the calls of the night
It smells like blood
Nosferatu
Whispers are everywhere
I can't bare it no longer
I can't resist to my desires anymore
There is something inside that I need so much
Insanity...
Nocturnal Desire
Has astrayed me, Desires ensued
My thirst was overcame and I had profaned
Thus I turned into a Nosferatu
You know you need the crimson treasure, to discover the taste
Grant me thy life and I'll have a taste of you
I prowled in the night thus my pallor skin met the noble red
You know you need the crimson treasure, to discover the taste
The demiurge lord bequeathed this life to me!!
But he stole mine
These lands belong to him
Punish me if you will, for my hands are not clean
But deny me not my revenge
Then his mists swelled and he gabbled his spell
Thus I fell
I choose this death with my own free will
I was gasping towards the sun on my last solstice
My amorphous dreams lightened by azure
My eternal life met with the omega
Then my grief abandoned me
Nocturnal Desire!!!
