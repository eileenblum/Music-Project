The land beneath my feet
Which I merited with my own blood
That I can't dare to lose at all.
I always opposed to my destiny and made my own
No one can stand in my way
Claiming what is already mine
Don't show me any pity cause I will not.
This war maybe the last...
The arrogance in my soul
Shall be the cause of my end...
Maybe...
Or maybe not...
I will make you experience anguish
My spite is rising with the bleeding moon
Portentous cacophony will sign the time
When it comes...
I closed my eyes in my vault
Lonely as a winter breeze
And I shrieked in my dream
A stitch covered my whole body
The vision of my end shown by him.
I will make you experience anguish
My spite is rising with the bleeding moon
Portentous cacophony will sign the time
When it comes...
I adrift myself to my scent
And I prepared my scheme
Thus I can grace to his life
The lurking shades whispers thy name
Lunar albedo lures thee
