Eleanor my love the ruler of my agonies,
I raised her from the grave of my heart.
Candles burned and killed the shadows.
And the day which I desired has arrived.
I slowly placed myself upon her frozen body
Which was covered by the smell of dust.
I kissed her bloody lips
As she slowly opened her luminous eyes.
Wine of ecstasy entered into our veins
So we could dance with the hymens of the night
Her amorous words charmed me
Prurient bodies embraced
I was seduced like a sin.
Thus my dark romance started
Ambitions are too high now
My temper in eerie
Obtaining her, it's like a dream
But ouija showed me the future
She, Eleanor
The Forbidden Angel
For she is my love
She is my obsession, She is my destiny
The unique largess of my poor life
Her groan killed my heart
And then grievous perdition has conquered my life again.
She doused like a candle, and I demitted her
The violent memory of her face took over my dreams
She has fallen to the unknown.
Her blood washed away my sins.
She is gone
The curse has taken ill-omened bride again,
The memories of that night that will never be forgotten
As I will feel it's omnipresence.
Eleanor, my love, the ruler of my agonies,
I buried her into the grave of my heart
Candles snuffed and shadows covered my soul
She, Eleanor...
Thus my dark romance ended.
