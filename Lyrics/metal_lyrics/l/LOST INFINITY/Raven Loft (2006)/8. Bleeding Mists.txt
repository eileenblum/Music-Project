Here my lands
From which you can never pass
Surrounded by the mists
I, the supreme being,
The lord of these majestic lands, far beyond another world
Thus you who was dragged to my stronghold
with my tempest
When darkness conquered the day
Howlings ascends amid the aerie's towers
Rivers bleed by the ceremonies of the dead bride
The dismay face of the stone castle changes the aspect of night
Cerberus of Hades growls to arouse the Lord
Then the Lord wakes like an acronycal of the darkest night
To sip vital liquid
His necromantic words brought algophobia to the habitants
Bleeding Mists, Bleeding Mists
Covered these lands
Bleeding Mists, Bleeding Mists
Serves for the devil lord
He slowly sank inside her through the flowing blood
Then her hollers benighted.
Another wilted life he left behind him
Before he retreats to his lair
Bleeding Mists, Bleeding Mists
Covered these lands
Bleeding Mists, Bleeding Mists
Serves for the devil lord
Vampiric mantras rises on the scarlet moon
The symbol of the darkest spell shines on the beclouded skies
Wolves howl and the others cry
A princes in a white bridal who could never hear the epithalamium
Her tears filled the fountain of sorrow
This kingdom is a ruin of a romance
The old leader of the land is now their immortal lord
As long as the blood is red, his kingdom will survive
Cause he is the chosen one
And they know about him who has always scorned from his lair
But no one knows about the winter in his heart
A deep blade wound from his darkest past
That will never recover.
The symbol of the darkest spell shines on the beclouded skies...
I, the supreme being,
Lord of these majestic lands, far beyond another world
I am the ancient, I am the land
There is no one so cursed as I.
