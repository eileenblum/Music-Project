A wind is loitering in it's own solitude
To retrieve her soul where the darkest shadows dance .
She is all alone among the abandoned dreams
As she hopes to find her lost romance
By following magical murmurs of the angels
The lonely wind is wandering towards the horizon,
Towards an unknown end
Hoping for the rain to come and hide her tears,
As she hides beneath the dismal clouds
Waiting to encounter her fate
She is all alone among the abandoned dreams
As she hopes to find her lost romance
By following magical murmurs of the Angels
Maybe one day her never ending sorrow will abandon
Her desperate soul
When the sun doesn't shine, she cries out to the Almighty
To meet her eyes with it's pure beam.
She gives in to the unknown justice of the night
Wondering about the fading stars
A wind is loitering in it's own solitude
To retrieve her soul where the darkest shadows dance .
She is all alone among the abandoned dreams
As she hopes to find her lost romance
By following the magical murmurs of the angels
She gives in to the unknown justice of the night
Wondering about the fading stars
Only death can calm her tormented soul
If ever the wind and her soul can become one again...
Then she surrenders to her rage, trying to get her revenge
From the leaves that have now turned brown at every fall
And revives to pay her ill-omened fate
Maybe one day her never ending sorrow will abandon
Her desperate soul
When the sun doesn't shine, she cries out to the Almighty
To meet her eyes with it's pure beam.
She waits to be purified by the curse that rules her body
As the despair wind blows over the oceans to which she is oblivious.
