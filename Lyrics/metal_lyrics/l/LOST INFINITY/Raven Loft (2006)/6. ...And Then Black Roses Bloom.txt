Walking on the lost paths of enchanted forests
Under the spells of full moon
Dancing with the songs of the raging wolves.
Passing through the dark castle
Everywhere, secret eyes are gazing over my body
I can feel the horror around me
Ultimate and exalted Stronghold
Rests behind the shadows and the mists
Where the angels were imprisoned in the gargoyles
Enigmatic raucous of the torturing souls
Are revealing with the memories of the black rose.
Ruins of the broken honour preserves its rage in his cold body
A following sorrow from his buried past will never leave him alone
Walking on the lost paths of enchanted forests
Under the spells of full moon
Dancing with the songs of the raging wolves.
Passing through the dark castle
Everywhere, secret eyes are gazing over my body
I can feel the horror around me
Pride of the knight and grief of ruin hides behind his helmet
Coldness of death he carries with himself
You Knight of the Black Rose
You can not deny your dismal past
You can not hide behind your mask
Feel your pain again and remember your fatal mistakes
Massacre of the betrayed prepared his own catastrophe
Cursed for his revenge again and again
...And then Black Roses Bloom
