I've knelt at your alter
I've cut out my heart
I've lived in your Ruins
my pain is your art

my wrists are bound tight so as not to bleed
my eyes were so dark so as not to see
the memories of the past
are fading like a bad dream

I've never been so alone than with you,
I've never been scared to dream until now,
I can't close my eyes,
I'll carry on, screaming

your words are like ice,
they melt in the heat
the cold and the pain
which you seem to breed
have become what you are
and left your ruins empty...
