Step into this picture
release all your light
I think God has gone mad... here tonight

You can't believe your eyes,
control is so hard to keep
obsession can be hell
from which you'll never be free
It's all for the taking, here tonight

Where good girls go to die
that's where I'll be
Waiting for my love with my heart on my sleeve

Forget about the future
forget about the past.
My heart beats so,
my hands are cold
please God make this moment last

You seek to fill me
with virtues I lack
I'll turn your pure white wings to pure black.

You've pushed too far and now
you've lost control can't you see?
You thought you were the master
but you're down on your knees.
It's all for the taking, here tonight

Where good girls go to die
that's where I'll be,
remembering our love as if it were a disease.

Forget about the future
it wasn't meant to last
My heart beats slow my hands are cold
Oh God it's the end at last.
