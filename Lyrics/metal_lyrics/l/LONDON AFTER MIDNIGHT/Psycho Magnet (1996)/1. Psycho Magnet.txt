Such a wretched waste of time
such a fool to be so blind
serpents hide behind your eyes
and I'm their prey tonight

Can we end this mind fuck please, your treachery's beyond belief
must you bring us to our knees with your psychopathic tendencies?
Please be gone and rest assured I see you as you are, perverse
with all your lies and empty words- I fear for you there is no cure.

Here we go another game
designed to butcher someone's brain
is that emotion I see feigned?
all reason's lost on the insane

Can we end this mind fuck please, your treachery's beyond belief
must you bring us to our knees with your psychopathic tendencies?
Please be gone and rest assured I see you as you are, perverse
with all your lies and empty words- I fear for you there is no cure.

Sincerity has not been found
beneath your self appointed crown
these bitter tears in which I drown
will soon be yours to drag you down

Can we end this mind fuck please, your treachery's beyond belief
must you bring us to our knees with your psychopathic tendencies?
Please be gone and rest assured I see you as you are, perverse
with all your lies and empty words- I fear for you there is no cure.
