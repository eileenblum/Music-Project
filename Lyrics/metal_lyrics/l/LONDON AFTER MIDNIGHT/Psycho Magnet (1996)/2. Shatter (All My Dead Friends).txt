You're telling me
that I'm the most important thing to you,
but can't you see?
you're killing me with all the things you do,
and I really want to believe it's impossible
I really want to believe it's all a dream,
but I just can't seem to wake up,
I just can't seem to turn on the light,
one step off the edge
and the world will seem all right

You did it again,
yes you in the mirror,
you put your faith in a cruel world,
All my dead friends come to haunt, harm and hinder, never letting go,
here to drag me down to Hell,
just say goodbye...

Just answer me,
what was the point of all that treachery,
and soon we'll see
the truth behind all of your blasphemy,

No never again
I'll never trust no one again,
I'd sooner slit my wrists and risk discovery of Hell,
than stay another moment here where certain Devils dwell...
