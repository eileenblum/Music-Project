I sense there's something in the wind
that feels like tragedy's at hand,
and though I'd like to stand by you,
can't shake this feeling that I know
the worst is just around the bend.

And does she notice
my feeling for her?
And can she see
how much she means to me?
I think it's not to be.

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
in their enthusiastic cloud,
try as I may it doesn't last.

And will we ever
end up together?
No, I think not.
It's never to become
for I am not the one...
