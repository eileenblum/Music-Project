What on earth went wrong
just tell me what went wrong
can't understand just how you feel

I know the end is near
but I no longer fear
that what we had was so unreal

why can't you feel it?
you had to know
how could you steal it?
let me break you

you made it all so mad
love or control gone bad
it seems to me you don't play fair
I've come to know your kind
through innocence then blind
believed in something that was never there...
