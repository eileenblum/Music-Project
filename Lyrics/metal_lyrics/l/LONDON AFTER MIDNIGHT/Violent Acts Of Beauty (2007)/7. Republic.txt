You're being used.
You're being lied,
to in a desert without water.
You are desperate to believe,
you're like a lamb led to the slaughter.
Self deceive you won't believe,
you're like a child seeking mother.
You need guidance,
you see violence as a way to control others.

Do you think that ignorance sets you free?
Has salavery made you all you can be?
Is cruelty your new authority?
Do you think the lies are convincing me?

I don't care if you hurt.
I don't care if you're blind.
If its too late to convince you,
then I don't care if you die.

You're in the dark,
you're in the depths,
you're in an ocean of disease.
You've lost control to those who know,
life as pain and lust and greed.
And in the end,
can you defend the things,
you say that you despise?
Can you see the cold and naked,
truth that's there before your eyes?

Do you think that ignorance sets you free?
Has salavery made you all you can be?
Is cruelty your new authority?
Do you think the lies are convincing me?

I don't care if you hurt.
I don't care if you're blind.
If its too late to convince you,
then I don't care if you die.

can you see?
You'll never be free.
can you see?
You'll never be free.

I don't care if you hurt.
I don't care if you're blind.
If its too late to convince you,
then I don't care if you die.

So die.
So die.
So die.
So die.
