Your color's fading,
your halo's looking dim.
Hide behind hate.
My patience has worn thin.
How can we proceed?
Just acknowledge,
what is true.
The clutton and the guilty,
the demon that is you.

You have let me down,
you have left me cold.
You don't understand,
you haven't won
you've begun, it's begun
The beginning of the end

I will not forget,
I cannot forgive.
You don't understand,
you haven't won,
you've begun, it's begun
the beginning of the end.

You're now addicted,
your future's looking dim.
So hide behind fear,
and watch the end begin.
It's complicated,
at least that's what you claim.
Who forgives the unrepetant?
And the crimes done in your name?

What have we become?
If we could start over again,
where would it lead us then?
But you can't escape the truth,
no matter what you want to believe,
it always come back to you.

You have let me down,
you have left me cold.
You don't understand,
you haven't won.
You've begun, it's begun,
the beginning of the end.

I will not forget,
I cannot forgive.
You don't understand,
you haven't won,
you've begun, it's begun
the beginning of the end.
