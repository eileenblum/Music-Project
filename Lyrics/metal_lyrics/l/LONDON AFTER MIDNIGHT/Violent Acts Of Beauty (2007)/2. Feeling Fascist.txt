Are you feeling Fascist?
Are you feeling mean?
We don't need a reason.
We don't need a thing.
We destroy just who we want to,
brutally is "in".
Oppression is our weapon,
chaos is our king.

If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy,
you should be happy.
If you amount to only this,
I'm really sorry,
I'm really sorry.
If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy,
you should be happy.
If you amount to only this,
I'm really sorry.

We never heard of free will,
independence is a sin.
If you think your superior,
then you're as good as in.
Its psychosis and delusion,
arrogance, denial.
And so much more awaits you, yeah,
we sell it by the mile.

If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy,
you should be happy.
If you amount to only this,
I'm really sorry,
I'm really sorry.
If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy,
you should be happy.
If you amount to only this,
I'm really sorry.

And are we justified?
I don't think so.
But we never let the truth get in the way.
And when you're crucified,
who will you turn to?
You can sell your soul to cover up the pain.

So if you're felling fascist,
and if your conscience is clean.
we're holier than everyone,
and immorally supreme.
Don't question what we tell you,
just devour what we sell.
Why should we serve in heaven,
when we could rule all in hell?

If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy,
you should be happy.
If you amount to only this,
I'm really sorry,
I'm really sorry.
If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy,
you should be happy.
If you amount to only this,
I'm really sorry,
I'm really sorry.

If ignorance is really bliss?
If ignorance is really bliss?
You should be happy.
