Come take a piece of me.
Come cripple what you see.
Come be a part of what's inside.
You wanted something more,
that what was really yours,
come on and use what you despise.

You're all ever need.
I'll never make you bleed,
until I use you up,
and still that's not enough.

And all that I can't see,
is insincerity.
And all that I can see,
is void of personality.

Don't go near,
the man you fear.

Just take away my name,
and bury all the fame.
And let the fear make them blind.
And that is all you need,
To satisfy your greed.
And sell yourself as the divine.

You're all ever need.
I'll never make you bleed,
until I use you up,
and still that's not enough.

And all that I can't see,
is insincerity.
And all that I can see,
is void of personality.

Don't go near,
the man you fear.
He's truth lies there,
the man you fear.

Don't go near,
the man you fear.
He's truth lies there,
the man you fear.

I am the man you fear.
I am the man you fear.
I am the man you fear.
I am the man you fear.
I am the man you fear.
I am the man you fear.
I am the man you fear.
