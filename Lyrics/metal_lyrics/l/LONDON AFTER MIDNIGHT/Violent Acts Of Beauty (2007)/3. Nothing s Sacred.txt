Nothing's sacred.
Nothing's pure.
Nothing's sacred, anymore.
Forget salvation.
Forget the cure
'cause nothing's sacred anymore.

I've seen it all.
I've seen it all before.
It's such a bore.
You sell your souls like a whores.

You've killed, free will.
Free Me, of responsibility.
You hope, you pray,
you'll be the one who's saved.

But nothing's sacred.
Nothing's pure.
Nothing's sacred, anymore.
Forget salvation.
Forget the cure
'cause nothing's sacred anymore.

I've asked you all.
I've begged you all before.
Give in to evolution,
but you'd rather buy absolution.

You've killed, free will.
Free Me, of responsibility.
You hope, you pray,
you'll be the one who's saved.

But nothing's sacred.
Nothing's pure.
Nothing's sacred, anymore.
Forget salvation.
Forget the cure
'cause nothing's sacred, anymore.

There's no salvation.
there's no truth.
We are your retribution.
We are the brutal youth.
We are the future.
We are the past.
We are your guilt trip.
And we are you class.

But nothing's sacred.
Nothing's pure.
Nothing's sacred, anymore.
Forget salvation.
Forget the cure
'cause nothing's sacred, anymore.
