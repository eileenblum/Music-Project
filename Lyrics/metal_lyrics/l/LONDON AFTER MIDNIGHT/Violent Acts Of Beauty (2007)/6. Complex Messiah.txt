You drew a line at being honest.
You drew a line at being sincere.
You drew a line at being there for me.
You drew a line that much is clear.
I don't believe that it was hopeless.
I don't believe you can get something for free.
And now I can honestly tell you,
you mean absolutely nothing to me.

I am the last man standing here.
I am the last one who'll tell you all the truth.
I am your last chance and you fear it,
so take your last breath brutal youth.
You can't see that you're killing yourselves.
you can't see that you've thrown it all away.
You've turned Heaven into Hell.
You're only happy when you inflict pain.

I don't want to think.
I don't want to feel.
I don't want to know.
I don't want to heal.
I don't want to love.
I don't want to help.
I don't want to trust.
I just want myself.
I don't want to give.
I don't want to grow.
There is nothing real,
I don't care who knows.
The last bridge is burned.
I just want to be,
the one in control,
With no empathy.

You can't see that you're killing yourselves.
you can't see that you've thrown it all away.
You've turned Heaven, into Hell.
You're only happy, when you inflict pain.
I am the last man standing here.
I am the last one who'll tell you all the truth.
I am your last chance and you fear it,
so take your last breath brutal youth.
