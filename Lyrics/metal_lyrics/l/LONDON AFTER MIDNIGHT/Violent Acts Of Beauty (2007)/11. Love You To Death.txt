I die when I hear your voice,
to touch you Divine.
Be my possession, my sweet obsession wine.

I'm dealing in demons love,
is just a matter of time.
I'll wear you down,
one day you will be mine.

Only I can make your life complete,
just give yourself to me.
Only I can make your destiny.

So give me your heart my love,
and give me your soul.
I'd give you mine but I
sold it long ago.

Only I can see inside of you
just give yourself to me.
And I won't stop until you see the truth.

I love you to death.
I love you completely,
a love that is purely vain.
I never meant to hurt you so badly,
I thought you'd enjoy the pain.

I know what you feel it love,
I can tell from your tears.
So don't deny me,
give into your fears.

I love you to death.
I love you completely,
a love that is purely vain.
I never meant to hurt you so badly,
I thought you'd enjoy the pain.
I love you to death.
I love you completely,
a love that is purely vain.
I never meant to hurt you so badly,
I thought you'd enjoy the pain.
