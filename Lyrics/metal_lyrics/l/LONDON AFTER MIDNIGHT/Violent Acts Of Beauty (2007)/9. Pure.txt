I, I used to be so sure.
I, I used to be so pure.
I cannot explain,
I get lost in the pain.
In the meaning there's a mystery,
that's hidden and locked,
that's the paradox,
You never know until it's too late.

I, I've seen it all before.
I, I wanted so much more.
The things I was sure,
were perfect and pure,
where nothing more than fantasies,
all hidden inside, something so unkind,
and you never know until it's too late.

I'm going to the open sea,
and I'm going to say goodbye to me.
I'm going to the open sea,
and I'm going to say goodbye to me.
I'm going to the open sea,
and I'm going to say goodbye to me.
I'm going to the open sea,
and I'm going to say goodbye to me.
