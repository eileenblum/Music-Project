Long after midnight, on a night like this
I'd sit by my blacklight and dream of your kiss
pulsating music filled my room and my head
and I dreamed what it'd be like to have you in my bed

I'm your best nightmare

And then it happened, you were in my arms
your lips on my throat- your hands on my, on my...
two bodies together the intimate sin
the pain and the pleasure could do mortals in
how could you know what I'm thinking of
to me lust can be as beautiful as love
here tonight, your pure heart and soul
untainted passion should have no control

She asked me if I...
I told her the truth
I said "I'm sorry it takes me longer than you"
she smiled and blushed and continued to grind
and promised to make me go out of my mind

returning her promise she came to a halt
licking my lips I tasted her salt
then she sat up and gasped and clutched at her breast
I thought she was coming- I'd never have guessed that
as she grew pale, as white as a flower
she collapsed to the floor and was dead in an hour.

I'm your best nightmare
