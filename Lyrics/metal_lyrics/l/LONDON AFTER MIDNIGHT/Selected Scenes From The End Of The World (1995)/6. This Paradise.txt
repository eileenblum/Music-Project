I could take your breath away,
I could make this feel so right
out of the blackest shadows
into your burning light

your touch would enthrall my heart,
my touch could release your soul
lying warm and dark in your arms,
come close to me now and take control
riding through endless nights,
bury the nameless dead
the stars will rain down in the night
cast out of Heaven by jealous angels of death

together we'll rule our world
together we'll rule theirs too
lightning and thunder collide
at the edge of the world for me and you

In this Paradise you'll find just what your looking for,
beauty right before you eyes,
how could you ask for more?
Here behind these eyes,
here inside my soul
hear the screams of a crucifixion ring through the dark,
ring through the cold
reach up and pull me down
into your hallowed ground
I'll lead you into temptation,
buried in passion I'll lead you down...
