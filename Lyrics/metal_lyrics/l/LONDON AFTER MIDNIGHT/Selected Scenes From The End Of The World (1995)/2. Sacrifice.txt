...and here we go again
we've taken it to the end
with every waking moment
we face this silent torment

I'd sacrifice,
sacrifice myself to you-
right here tonight
because you know that I love you-

Darkness is all I want to see
I could never put in to words
what it is you mean to me
The candle is burning low
at the window to my soul
the reaper is at my door now
he's come to take me home...

I'd sacrifice,
sacrifice myself to you-
right here tonight
because you know that I love you
