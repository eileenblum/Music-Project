Spirits seem to drift up through a darkened sky
drifting through dead branches in the night
while in the moonlight we
go down upon our knees
entwined together only we can see their beauty

Beneath the stars a bell begins to toll
for reasons which we really shouldn't know
so take a walk with me down to the cemetery
wrap me in darkness, Claire make love to me

I am thunder
I am rain
I am pleasure
I am pain

Only in darkness can there be light
tell me angel have you prayed tonight?

In the dark I know you all so well
beauty from Heaven wrapped 'round souls from Hell
so take a drink from me
my sacrifice to thee
damned fallen angels,
always blessed with me.
