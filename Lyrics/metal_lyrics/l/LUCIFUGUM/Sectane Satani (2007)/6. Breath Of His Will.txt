Apage a me, christi! 
Let speak the One who have taken away the right to keep silence 
The One who didn't see His cradle and who didn't have a mother 
Refracting the rays of the false enlightener and dispersing the invisible 
The One who have grabbed the lighting from the sky and who have knocked out the crown of the false lord 
In carne! 
You'll not take their sight away, they're already blind 
Justitia Summa! 
You'll become a thorn when they press on you 
You'll tell all answers in the beginning and deprive them of sense of life. Because questions don't exist 
You'll become a heresy if they need truth 

Omne Una Manet Nox! 
They'll not grow in their wisdom to realize Your Majesty 
You don't need the glory of this world while they stink here 
Abyssos Abyssum Invocat! 
Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.
