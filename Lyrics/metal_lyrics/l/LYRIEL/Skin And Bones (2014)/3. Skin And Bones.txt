Here I am, where are you?
Are you scared of yourself or of me?
I am here, I can wait
I can see through your half-hearted hate

You can torture me and tear my life apart
I will be your worst fear

Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will never find me
Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will not find me

Love and hate, we share both
I find comfort in all of their schemes
Trust my words, I can see
Your affliction within your means

You can torture me and tear my life apart
I will be your worst fear

Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will never find me
Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will not find me

In a distant memory you will forget my name
You forget my face and hand
And time will do the same
But then again a fading scent 
Will make you turn your head
And in a memory I stand
What you mostly regret

You can torture me and tear my life apart
I will be your worst fear

Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will never find me
Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will not find me

Into your skin and bones
I will never leave your mind
I will be there in every moment, every thought, every breath you take

You can torture me and tear my life apart
I will be your worst fear

Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will never find me
Into your skin and bones
You will never find me
Into your thoughts and breath
You will not find me
