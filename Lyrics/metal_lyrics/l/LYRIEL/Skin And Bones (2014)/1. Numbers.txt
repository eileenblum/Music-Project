1, 2, 3, 4
I'm falling to my knees
I'm crying out and begging to you
Please, please don't deny
I need to know if I was right or wrong

3, 4, 5, 6
You promised not to lie to me
To tell the truth
Though I may not like what I hear
Or what I see in you

Every second holds a lovely memory of you
Every second breeds a new one that I have to cling to

Time after time all the hours I've counted
1, 2, 3, 4
Numbers all in vain, all in vain
Time after time I am longing for a release
Let the time stand still

5, 6, 7, 8
You say I am too late
You need to do just what you think is true
And I shall not hold on to things
I can't define as right or wrong

7, 8, 9, 10
And then again
You stand in front of me
With eyes of gold and grey
And let me pray to every word you say

Every second holds a lovely memory of you
Every second breeds a new one that I have to cling to

Time after time all the hours I've counted
1, 2, 3, 4
Numbers all in vain, all in vain
Time after time I am longing for a release
Let the time stand still
