Have you ever been told what to do?
Have you ever been pushed around?
Have you ever been asked to lie?
Just a little lie, just a little little lie

Have you ever been truthful with me
I have never been asking anything
That you canât give 
That you canât give

Give me a sign
Give me the confidence
Give me a chance to evolve
Tell me a lie
Tell me I'm blind
Tell me that I'm not worth the fight
I'm worth the fight

Have you ever been all by yourself?
Have you ever been lonely to the core?
Maybe you would understand
Maybe you would understand

Give me a sign
Give me the confidence 
Give me a chance to evolve
Tell me a lie
Tell me I'm blind
Tell me that I'm not worth
Give me a sign
Give me the confidence 
Give me a chance to evolve
Tell me a lie
Tell me I'm blind
Tell me that I'm not worth the fight

I am gone with the wind never to be seen
I am gone with a kiss on your lips 
I am gone with the wind never to be seen
I am gone with a kiss on your lips
