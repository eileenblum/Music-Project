Never trust what is said
Never think just what they tell you to
Never try to be like them

Stones turn to dust
Beauty will turn to age
We are born to fade

You've always been a part of me
For ever and ever I will think of you
It's always hard to see you go
You are all I know
You are all I know

Always reach for the sky
Always look out for the one behind
Always be ahead of all

Stones turn to dust
Beauty will turn to age
We are born to fade

You've always been a part of me
For ever and ever I will think of you
It's always hard to see you go
You are all I know
You are all I know

Every time I stop, every time I go on
I think of you
Every time I turn
Every time I reach out for you
I'm alone

You've always been a part of me
For ever and ever I will think of you
It's always hard to see you go
You are all I know
