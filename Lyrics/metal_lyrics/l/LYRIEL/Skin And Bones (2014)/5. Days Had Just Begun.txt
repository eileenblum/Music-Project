They listened at the porch that day 
A story on and on
I told them of a life before
When days had just begun

All my hopes I told to the sun
To the stars and the moon 
But we just live once

I met him in a crowded time
When no one dared to breathe
And just with a glimpse of an eye
We lay in cross-leaved heath

All my hopes I told to the sun
To the stars and the moon 
But we just live once

I left when autumn came to stay
For time was flying by
And the trees where growing old
Life is too short
I was too young
You know the days had just begun

All my hopes I told to the sun
To the stars and the moon 
But we just live once
