We celebrate the wars we win
We fuck the guys we hate
We drown our sorrows in a pool of gin
And wonder why we're always late

We dress ourselves in skinny jeans
We choose our mental leaders
And wonder what the hell it means
When they refuse to heal us

We are better when we drink
We're much better when we don't think
That is everything we've got
Running in our blood
[2x]

We pack a pair of shoes to walk
And one that just looks nice
How come you cannot stop to talk
When I try to apologize?

What we did were our choices
We thought that we should have known
We're losing our pretty voices
By yelling at walls of stone

We are better when we drink
We're much better when we don't think
That is everything we've got
Running in our blood
[2x]

We leave when we're supposed to stay
We pray when there's no other way
The room is full of pretty liars
And we want more and we want higher

We are better when we drink
We're much better when we don't think
That is everything we've got
Running in our blood
