Take this kiss upon the lip
And let me see a smile
Your image is the golden drip
That guides me for a while
My days are a dream 
My nights are a lie 
You are what I seek to hold 
In the cold of the times

All that we see or seem to be 
Is but a dream within a dream within a dream 
All that we see or seem to be 
Is but a dream within a dream

I wait up on a golden shore 
With sunshine in my hands 
While listening to the endless roar 
I hope for farthest lands 
My days are a dream 
My nights are a lie 
You are what I seek to hold 
In the cold of the times

All that we see or seem to be 
Is but a dream within a dream within a dream 
All that we see or seem to be 
Is but a dream within a dream

Can I not hold you in my arms so tight? 
Can I not save you from the cold of bitter times? 
In a smile or in a pitiless embrace
We are not supposed to be

All that we see or seem to be 
Is but a dream within a dream
