Wind upon my shattered skin
Words predict a new begin
I recall your eyes reflect the skies

Dirt under my tired feet
In my hand an empty sheet
Words will never save me from your eyes

Speak to me now, tell me a tale
Tell me a secret no one knows
If I awake, lifting the veil
Show me the path that no one dares to go

As if I could see through your disguise
I stare into your eyes

I would stand a thousand fights
But we're not meant to be
I would compose a thousand rhymes
To heal the misery
When everything turns dark tonight
Weâre still not meant to be
The day in all itâs warming light
Canât heal the misery

Water flows in broken times
Covers up our silent crimes
Still they are reflected in your eyes

Warm and soft a tender stroke
Like a leaf of poison oak
Do you know we have to pay the price?

Speak to me now, tell me a tale
Tell me a secret no one knows
If I awake, lifting the veil
Show me the path that no one dares to go

As if I could see through your disguise
I stare into your eyes

I would stand a thousand fights
But we're not meant to be
I would compose a thousand rhymes
To heal the misery
When everything turns dark tonight
Weâre still not meant to be
The day in all itâs warming light
Canât heal the misery
