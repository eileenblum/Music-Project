I scatter words and papers, useless facts and scenes
Consider what you said and live within my means

That's what I am, what I become
That's what I choose when I choose you

Clouds and thunderstorm and dusty shadows
Dark and endlessly
I'm prepared to see the mountains crumble
Come on, let the skies fall on me
[2x]

I'm not afraid of losing hope or liberty
I know I'm always getting out of misery

That's what I am, what I become
That's what I choose when I choose you

Clouds and thunderstorm and dusty shadows
Dark and endlessly
I'm prepared to see the mountains crumble
Come on, let the skies fall on me
[2x]

Let them fall
Let them fall on me

Clouds and thunderstorm and dusty shadows
Dark and endlessly
I'm prepared to see the mountains crumble
Come on, let the skies fall on me
[2x]

Let them fall on me
Come on let them fall
