Pass me by like snow vanishes on frozen hands 
Down the spine like days without a compliment 
It's been years since we have truly been one 

Things I store within the deepest core 
Not revealed to whom they're really meant for 
Everything is already said and done 

Blood on my hands dripping on the floor, to my feet 
Blood in my chest racing with my heartbeat 
I was condemned when I first saw you 
There is no coming back from you 

Stay! For day is turning into night 
Stay! My eyes no longer see the light 
Stay! The color's fading into black and white 
Stay! For day is turning into night 
Stay! My eyes no longer see the light 
Stay! The colors once have been so bright 
Stay black and white 

Look at me as you once did with kinder eyes 
I am still the one who has to pay the price 
Anything you asked I did it for you 

When you leave think of, think of the times we had 
Think of me with love instead of pale regret 
Bear in mind that I was never untrue 

Blood on my hands dripping on the floor, to my feet 
Blood in my chest racing with my heartbeat 
You were condemned when I first saw you 
There is no coming back from me 

Stay! For day is turning into night 
Stay! My eyes no longer see the light 
Stay! The color's fading into black and white 
Stay! For day is turning into night 
Stay! My eyes no longer see the light 
Stay! The colors once have been so bright 
Stay black and white 

Stay with me
See the light

Turn black and white
