The light of the secrets in the forest
The glory light lives behind my closed eyes
Someone fight by my side
While I cry and prefer to hide
Remit my curse remit my fate
With the crown of the twilight

The touch of plains, the touch inside
And the breeze of the sunlight
Where the darkness lives I have to hide
Then I will escape through the stars
Into the light
Without glory is the crown
of the twilight

Reality is a world of illusions
The candlelight flares at the
edge of the wind
What is true what is not
Is there someone worthy of trust
What I am, I am not
But the crown of the twilight

The touch of plains, the touch inside
And the breeze of the sunlight
Where the darkness lives I have to hide
Then I will escape through the stars
Into the light
Without glory is the crown of the twilight

The brightness of the sword never tells the truth
The blood on it has never washed away
So you can't tell, so you can't hide
Your own opinion is so questionable like me
We are slaves for the crown of the twilight

and never fear [x4]
