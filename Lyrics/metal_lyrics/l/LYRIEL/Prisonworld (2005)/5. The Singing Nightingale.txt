The crying owl, the crying owl
Cries a prophecy of storm for all of us
The nightingale, the nightingale
Is going on to sing her song her evening star

Nightingale, don't you know, taciturn
You must learn to be and to...

...Show in the eyes of the dangerous night
It brings storm, it brings death
Believe my words and despair
Learn to fear, learn to shake
When the dangerous me awakes
The black clouds are soon near

So you should fear, so you should fear
Says the anxious owl which seems so sorrowed
My lovely owl, my lovely owl
Says the nightingale so modestly she is

I am known, for the storm, it has time,
time to care
Nightingale...

...Show in the eyes of the dangerous night
It brings storm, it brings death
Believe my words and despair
Learn to fear, learn to shake
When the dangerous me awakes
The black clouds are soon near

So let me sing, my lovely owl
When the danger is here I'm taciturn
And I will hide between a bough,
till the heaven will alight I'm taciturn
