Unknown lands, don't exist
Cause the unknown will never exist
Look behind the ocean
It ends at the end of the disk

Only a few, suppose more
There exists more than our eyes can see
But be careful with your words
Or faster than the wind
You're banned for every time

Fear and doubt of society
Builds the prisonworld
A little world where you can't get free
We sleep every night next to the key

Prisonworld fall
I am the wall
I am alone
But I sit on the throne
This is my world
Brighter than yours
The Prisonworld lives in pain
You are your pain
You have no brave
Irresolute, blind if you're not insane
Unlimited, is the real world of possibilities

It exists more than one
Unexplored wonderoceans of life
Living in farsightedness in the
ocean of light
The wish is our force

From aside, world of light
I suspended through the silvery night
And I discover that my wish
is ever command
On the other side

Fear and doubt of society
Builds the prisonworld
A little world where you can't get free
We sleep every night next to the key

Prisonworld fall
I am the wall
I am alone
But I sit on the throne
This is my world
Brighter than yours
The Prisonworld lives in pain
You are your pain
You have no brave
Irresolute, blind if you're not insane
Unlimited, is the real world

I discover myself
I live my own world
I don't accept the words the very first time
Adventures call you
You can have share
Listen to inner words
They show you the way

Are you eyes even dimmed
You can't wonder, can't amaze
And your knowledge is not your own
You're a part of system life
And your inner world dies
For freedom calls your soul
But you ignorant cannot see
Cause you don't look next to the way

Adventures, seduce to be brave
Don't be your slave
Your travel is long
And think you haven't begun
Far to the end
The treasure reward
You will find whatever you searched:
Freedom
