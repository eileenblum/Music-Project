The world is cold, the heaven grey, the dark clouds travel faster
The frozen wind cut in my face my nose is red
With every step I go I hear the snow grates under my shoes
Hypnotic is the moving of the little flakes

With every step I feel the knife of the cold winter
I cannot move my hands, I have lost the feeling
I catch the snowflakes with my nose while I'm waiting for
The man who said me that I'll meet him there this day

And as he left a year ago
It breaks my heart it passed so slow
I smell the cent of you
But around me no sign of you
You're my only thought
The judgement of my harvest heart

I was not prepared for finiteness
But my fate has taken my soul
Step by step, I have fear of my realization
I can feel - there is sunlight - it gives me consolation
I confess that my love will never come back

My soul is rent, my heart is lost, give in my dispensation
My time is out; I feel the sun under the snow
It's my deliverance I think like bright the fresh rivers stream
Take off my body like an old attrition coat

Heartily glad gets through my mind as I fly over me
Is now the time to ripe into another world
The omniscience comes over me I feel free, I see
A movie of my life takes place and I remember

And as he left a year ago
It breaks my heart it passed so slow
I smell the cent of you
But around me no sign of you
You're my only thought
The judgement of my harvest heart

So I survey my life, I lived all the years since now
Like a movie across the time, my own life
I feel all the feelings of the other
And I see how they saw me
The movie ends in this winter without love, without friends

Come to my side into the light
Give me your hand and follow me
The promise I gave, I called at my grave
And I am back for keeping my words

We go the way into the light
And leave behind the dark cold night
We go the way into the light
To reach the omniscience of bright
