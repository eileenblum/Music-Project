When spring begins again to light
And so nice is the world,
with colors bright
In the fields and hills with leaves of green
When leaves burst forth for spring to be seen

I'm the dew on the rose in the sun
I'm a cloud in the sky and I run
Into my dreams, into the sun

I'm a maid, what's my fate
I know there is anywhere the one
I have wings, I will fly
Through the clouds, like a bird,
Spread the wings and I fly into the sky

Welcoming spring, like flowers I'm alive
But I fear the cold night,
with my live I have to fight
But now I feel the sun
Don't think on the coming night

I'm the dew on the rose in the sun
I'm a cloud in the sky and I run
Into my dreams, into the sun

The sunset is soon near
I don't know if I'll stay alive

I'm the dew on the rose in the sun
I'm a cloud in the sky and I run
Into my dreams, into the sun
