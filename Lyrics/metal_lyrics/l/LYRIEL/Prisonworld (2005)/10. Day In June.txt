Alone in the night, I sit in the moonlight
I drift to my fairylands
The wind feels cold in my hands
And I dream of you
I know the pictures aren't true
I guess I can feel your soul

You visit me too
Daily I have to remember
The day in June, I couldn't help you
Traitor screams my folk, your enemies
Please request mercy
Cause then you will find a quick end
I can't see how they torment you

(Na na na na ...)

You keep your pride
That's the last battle you fight
Now your rebellion ends
I know you fight for your right
And for your love
Stony is the way of love
Some days it's covered in blood
and revenge

Daily I have to remember
The day in June, I couldn't help you
Traitor screams my folk, your enemies
Please request mercy
Cause then you will find a quick end
I can't see how they torment you

(Na na na na ...)
