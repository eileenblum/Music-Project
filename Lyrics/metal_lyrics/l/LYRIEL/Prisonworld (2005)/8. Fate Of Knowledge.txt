I want to live my life on my own
With my folk of the sun
I wanna live and have fun
I know two elves are looking for me
Can't you understand
I don't need your love
cause I love to be free
But they are fighting for me

Now it's time to decide for one
Says the mother from the folk of the sun
The hearts are bound when the love has found
Now it's time to decide for one

In my heart I hear the answer
It tells the name that I don't like
I ignore the fate of knowledge
As I look, in his eyes
I don't like him, yes I hate him
But my heart calls his name
