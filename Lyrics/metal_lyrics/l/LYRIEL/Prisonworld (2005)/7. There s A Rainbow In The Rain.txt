Behind the window falls rain
Some questions I ask me again
Which demon torments my soul
Near nothing what glitter is gold
I fear the time
The hungry beast is never satisfied
I get loosing my fade to delight
While I stand here and fight

There's a rainbow in the rain
...Schalalalala...

Whatever I do I get lost
The loss of every fight
And often I fell I get tired
So I lose the fade to the light
I'm the victim of the challenge
And of my own fate
My way ends at the blind alley
Or is it only a hill

There's a rainbow in the rain
...Schalalalala...

So I'm alone and faithful on my way
Soap bubbles burst and
have nothing to say
Heal my deep wounds

Rainbow in the rain
