Wild dreams, wild lust,
Seduced, and passionately touched
You're back, in hope for one kiss
In love, cold breath, we're one,
In our perspiration

You rule my soul, you thaw my skin
Console my tears, and be my sin!
Where ways begin to separate, that's our fate
There's only you, there's only me
I feel your lips, in ecstasy

Touch on my skin, I love your way
The candle lights, it's time to pray
In the middle of the moonlight,
First time to pray

And I close my eyes
For to lose yourself in me,
It's a new yearning you awake in me

Do with me what you want
And what you did in your dreams
Let us forget, that we are not yet married

Feel the snake of sin,
It might bring us to ruin
What we do is against the will of god
They could hang you high and let me burn
If you can't give away from me

Wild dreams, wild lust,
Seduced, and passionately touched
The moonlight enchants me
In love, cold breath,
My tears are only for your love
And for the perfect night

Moonlight enchants me, my heart's your slave
My curious, win now
The fight against the reason
God forgive my sin

Finish with me, what we begun
And in the moonlight, I feel the sun
The only way, you find in me
No other way, and we feel free
The only witness is the starry sky
I say some lovely whispers, and could die
I am fathomed, the innocence
Forever lost, forever past
In the middle of the moonlight, forever past

More intensified,
From one moment to the next
And your breath goes faster ever more

And we melt to one
And get one with the universe
We are one step behind the door of heaven
Now relax, darling, on my perspirated skin
With my hand I swim through your hair
And I know you cannot keep away from me
'Cause the moonlight is enchanted

Wild dreams, wild lust,
Seduced, and passionately touched
The moonlight enchants me
In love, cold breath,
My tears are only for your love
And for the perfect night

Moonlight enchant me, my heart's your slave
My curious, win now
The fight against reason
God forgive my sin
