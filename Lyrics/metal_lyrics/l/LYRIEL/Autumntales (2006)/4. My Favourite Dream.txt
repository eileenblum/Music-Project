He is nice, he is young
He is graceful, the son of the king,
A part of my favourite dreams
In the night, his eyes always light, only for me
And one day it will be.

What ever you'll see in me
One night long I am your favourite dream
Never forget me
Cause you won't ever know who I am

Stupid sisters of mine,
Your dreams will forever be dreams,
Not more
He'll have the chance to call me his wife soon
And no way to resist
His kismet he'll find, he'll find only in me

Heaven, oh heaven, please send me a sign
Cause the bad sisters are sisters of mine
Heaven, oh heaven, please give me a chance
Let me be delighted and free
Only this night

I'll leave no stone unturned
In my beautiful endless frock
I'm soft and tender like a rose in red,
Enchanted and glad
I'll enter the room gracile and in bloom

What ever you'll see in me
One night long I am your favourite dream
Never forget me
Cause you won't ever know who I am

Heaven, oh heaven, please send me a sign
Cause the bad sisters are sisters of mine
Heaven, oh heaven please give me a chance
Let me be delighted and free
Only this night

I close my eyes
And start my favourite dream
