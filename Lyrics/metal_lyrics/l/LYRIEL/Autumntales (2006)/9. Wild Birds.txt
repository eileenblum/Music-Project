Lovely how we met each other,
Once in a clear summer night,
Our hearts sang merry songs.

As our souls come dancing by,
There stood in golden cages locked,
The tame birds by the riverside.

They'll never know the lovely dance,
Can never feel the touch of night,
For tame birds sing a song
Of freedom while the wild birds fly.

For tame birds sing a song
Of freedom while the wild birds fly.

Though their song was beautiful,
Full of dreams about a flight,
They'd never dare to join our dancing
looked at us not understanding,
Why our sun could shine more bright.

And our wildness makes them
Full of bright,
For tame birds sing a song
Of freedom while the wild birds fly.

No limits for our love were set,
We danced and sang to mornings light.
They looked at us not understanding,
Why our sun could shine more bright.

For tame birds sing a song
Of freedom while the wild birds fly.

Happily they bear their fate,
Can't miss what they never had.
They don't know about the other world.

Where we dwell,
Sing and dance together.
But we remain wild birds forever,
Until we fail, until we're dead!
