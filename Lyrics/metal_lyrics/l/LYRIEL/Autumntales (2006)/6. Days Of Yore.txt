Day by Day we can't help growing older
Year by year spring did not help to feel young
Even the sun is getting cold and colder
I've failed you in more ways than one

Tonight the evening mists,
Find no place to gather
Twilight falls, light drops of silent rain
Saddened by the dying spring
Song and dance have come to an end

I think back of all my days of yore
Laugh and talk vanished to ash and smoke
I do nothing to remember
But I'm not able to forget

Tonight the evening mists,
Find no place to gather
Twilight falls, light drops of silent rain
Saddened by the dying spring
Song and dance have come to an end

Your lonely grave a thousand miles away
My face full of dust my hair like snow
There's a loveliness we share
Even though we're a thousand miles apart

Tonight the evening mists,
Find no place to gather
Twilight falls, light drops of silent rain
Saddened by the dying spring
Song and dance have come to an end

When shall we lie again
With no more tears
Hardly able to bear the sorrows
And regrets of my dreams
I have come a thousand miles
Sad now with autumn
And with my hundred years of woe
I climb this height alone

My road has wound
Through many years
Yellow leaves are shaken with a gale
Why should you linger
At the fork of the road
Too late to learn what sorrow means

Since yesterday betrayed and bolt me
Today has hurt my heart even more
I bless you for your true advice
But if we met I would not mind

Dance with me we're leaving all to soon
(Dance with me we're leaving all to soon)

Spring flowers, autumn moon,
When will they end?
