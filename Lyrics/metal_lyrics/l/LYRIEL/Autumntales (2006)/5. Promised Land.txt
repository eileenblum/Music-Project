Ahead I see the shoes
Well-worn from all the land
Gentle ones and kind
As well as bleak and baleful ones
We've seen
Our journey through decades

The auras of the world
Are always suffusing our heads
Faces passing by
Some to notice and some to forget

Our shadows stay behind
Where once we were condemned
To be slaves
Today nothing is left
But our bleached and battered
Skin and bones

Now our hearts arrived
Where our souls are still longing to be
Step by step we go
The road is long, the fate in our hands

Our way to the promised land
We seek to reach it soon
The land where we can linger after all
A place to just call home

Ahead I see a boy
His young hands outworn from hard work
Who defines his life
He is not the one who pulls the strings
But see
Our journey far away

We beg for freedom
But sorrow is all we receive
Too weak to fight against
But too strong to just accept without hate

These days are long ago
I turn my eyes to better dreams
We don't fear the dark
Cause we want to achieve an aim

From now on there's no mourn
Only laughter will be our guide
Now our hearts arrived
And our souls don't need to long anymore

Our way to the promised land
We seek to reach it soon
The land where we can linger after all
A place to just call home
