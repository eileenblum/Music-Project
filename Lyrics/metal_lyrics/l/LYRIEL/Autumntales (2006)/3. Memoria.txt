False world goodbye,
The enemy to rest
Now do the worst,
I do not weigh the spite
Free from the cares,
I live forever blessed
Enjoying peace and heavenly true delight

Round the world and back again
Is very far to roam
The footloose life of now and then
A wind-bound exile far from home
The leaves that just are open now
They'll have to fade and fall
Their faithful ever blooming now
Is merely in pain at all

Time's endlessly weighing
If you're prepared for the great trial
You know that you're just waiting
For the old man's smile

I remember all words spoken
All the songs that had been sung
How gracious were our hearts unbroken
When you and me were, oh, so young

Can't you see the coming dawn
Of summer day
Can't you smell the fear
For this endless way

False world goodbye,
The enemy to rest
Now do the worst,
I do not weigh the spite
Free from the cares,
I live for ever blessed
Enjoying peace and heavenly true delight

All the words remain unstated
All the songs I do not know
All too late my mind's elated
Take over now regretful woe

The summer's turning into pale
Finally I close my eyes
There is no use to desperate wail
Although it calls my soul to die at last
