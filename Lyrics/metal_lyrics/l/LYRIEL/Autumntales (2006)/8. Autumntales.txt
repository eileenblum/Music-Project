Farewell, oh farewell
Sweet dancers in the wind
I see you are prepared to come with me
The long way home again

Farewell, my beloved
(Farewell to you)
I whisper to a fading flower
(I greet your embrace)
There's so much life in dying
After all this time you can go to sleep
(After all this time that passed
I can go to sleep)

This well-known melody
Rises up above the orphaned trees
Rejoining the restless wind
Bequeath scarlet rain to hunted leaves

Through this decay, you can see her
How she wanders
How she cries silent tears
Midnight's coming all too soon
And she has to end what she's begun

Come near come near to me
I know you are frightened
And I can't keep you safe
But see there's nothing holding you anymore
So please, don't insist on the waste

And now I see your eyes
(I'm waiting for you)
Your broken beauty is my guide
(I welcome your kiss)
There's so much life in dying
Take my hand,
Rest your head and seek relief
(I've saved my life for you,
Oh come near, let me seek relief)

Hope in her hair
And her fingers borrow pity out of your heart
Her eyes are staring right through you
And you can see yourself in them

Sweet dancers
There is nothing holding you anymore
Please come with me, my dear

Now autumn's tears begin to freeze
And I'm willing to leave again
