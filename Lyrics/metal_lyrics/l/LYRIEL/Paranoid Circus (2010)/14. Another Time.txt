[Poem "Do Not Stand By My Grave and Weep" by: Mary Frye in 1932]

He came along
He passed your way
Did not empathize
Time is not over
life's just begun
But he won't care

I had a feeling deep inside
But my mentation thrust aside
Don't disavow this
Why does it happen all to me
Who is the bewildered designee
From now on nothings more the same

Behind the light and far beyond our mind
There we will meet in nowhere
Another time and in another place
When I'll leave
You will invite me with your embrace

Can't let you go
Retire from the world I undergo
Have only the memories - they make me cry
And smile although

It makes no sense to forsake
Live will go on without a break
Words cannot salve it
So many questions in my head
So many things I never said
From now on this will remain unchanged

Death is nothing at all, it is our fate

Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there, I do not sleep
Do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there, I did not die!

Behind the light and far beyond our mind
There we will meet in nowhere
Another time and in another place
When I'll leave
You will invite me with your embrace
