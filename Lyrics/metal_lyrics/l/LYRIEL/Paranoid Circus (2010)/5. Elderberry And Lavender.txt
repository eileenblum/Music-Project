[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]
[Poem "You Left Me" by: Emily Dickinson]

Elderberry and lavender
yet in full bloom when we first met
In your eyes such a blossom
oh this beauty I'll never forget

Sepia-coloured memories nailed
like butterflies in a neatly row
And yet preserved for the sweet day
When I hear the m crying
Help me! Free me!

You left me, sweet, two legacies
A legacy of love
A heavenly father would content
Had he the offer off
You left me boundaries of pain
Capacious as the sea
Between eternity and time
Your consciousness and me

On and on, love and sorrow
like a laurel crown on your head
Have you seen that little photograph
on the wall that detains the sunset.

Sepia-coloured memories nailed
like butterflies in a neatly row
And yet preserved for the sweet day
When I hear the m crying
Help me! Free me!

You left me two legacies
A heavenly father would content, had he the offer of
(A legacy)
You left me- boundaries of pain
(A legacy of love, he would content, had he the offer of)
Capacious as the sea
(Between eternity, eternity and time, your consciousness and me)
Your consciousness and me, and me

Sepia-coloured memories nailed
like butterflies in a neatly row
And yet preserved for the sweet day
When I hear the m crying
Help me! Free me!
