[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

Welcome my friends
Welcome to laugh and tragic
To innocence and sin
It's calling and curse
We're here to play the game again
The show must go on

Moving home where silence's waiting in each shaded corner
Laughing at my face when I need shelter from the world but
That is life, from time to time it's falling to pieces
So I open up my heart and let the music grow cause

It is the old soul inside the melody and
We are all addicted to
It's a mirror-writing-world
It's melting mind and deed in harmony
Healing just as ruin
But it's worth the fall, it is our last escape

Welcome my friends
Welcome to laugh and tragic
To innocence and sin
It's calling and curse
We're here to play the game again
The show must go on

Hopelessness on thousand walls
Singing songs of freedom so
Hate the flying bird as you love his song

From the most distance time
I see my dignity fail
All the wasted tears about a barren land
Don't sow the tree of life
From the most distance time
I see my dignity fail
All the wasted tears about a barren land
Don't sow the tree of life
Don't sow the tree of life

Waking up in ease and comfort, greet the lovely morning
Each and every day beside your calm, familiar presence
It's like a symphony, an everlasting mercy
So I open up my heart and let the music grow cause

It is the old sole inside the melody and
We are all addicted to
It's a mirror-writing-world
It's melting mind and deed in harmony
Healing just as ruin
But it's worth the fall, it is our last escape

Welcome my friends
Welcome to laugh and tragic
To innocence and sin
It's calling and curse
We're here to play the game again
The show must go on

In elation and delight
Lies no eternity so
Love the bounteousness as you fear the end

From the most distance time
I see my dignity arise
Into the sky, into my heart
Sowing the tree of life
From the most distance time
I see my dignity arise
Into the sky, into my heart
Sowing the tree of life
Cherish the bloom of life
Gather the fruits of life
