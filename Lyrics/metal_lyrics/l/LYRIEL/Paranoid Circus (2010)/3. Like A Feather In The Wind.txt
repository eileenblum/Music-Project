[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

Look at me I guess I am
Like a feather in the wind
Signs and wonders all out there
I will seek; I will never come to rest

I am leaving now, and this time it is for good
Don't waste your time to talk me out of it
For I won't cry a tear for you
This is not the end it's the beginning of my life
As it's meant to be, fabulous and colourful
And you can never see

This world isn't what it seems
It's cruel and cold and bitter
Where I go there's a beautiful sky
There is hope in the dark of the night
I get lost in a dream of a hummingbird
How it's eager to fly
On it's way to paradise it
Puts a feather in my hand

Look at me I guess I am
Like this feather in the wind
Signs and wonders all out there
I will seek; I will never come to rest

I will turn around and I will see a foreign street
Leading me away from your deceitful ignorance
That's chasing me this way
This is no equality; it's nothing but a lie
I forgot to see the fascination of a dream
That you can never be

Please don't come near, your eyes are
Asking me to stay here
Can't you understand, I am meant to fly away, away

This world isn't what it seems
It's cruel and cold and bitter
Where I go there's an ever-blue sky
There is hope in the dark of the night
I get lost in a dream of a hummingbird
How it's eager to fly
On it's way to paradise it
Puts a feather in my hand

Look at me I guess I am
Like this feather in the wind
Signs and wonders all out there
I will seek; I will never come to rest

Look at me I guess I am
Like this feather in the wind

Signs and wonders all out there
I will seek; I will never come to rest
I'll never come to rest
(Come with me, I have waited for you, in your dream,
All this time I've saved my gift for you)
