[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

Whatever I've searched
I was sure it won't take a lifetime to find
So I left with words of confidence
The angel of revenge was the fellow by my side

I held your love right in my hands
Along with your vow
Turning away for glory and fame
Now left me a dying fool

Angel of death, cold hands on my shoulder
But I'm just having thought of you
Beautiful queen of my broken heart

I held your love right in my hands
Along with your vow
Turning away for glory and fame
Now left me a dying fool

Take me to the flames
Burn the shroud into ashes
Step by step the flames
Take me close to you
And back to times when

I held your love right in my hands
Along with your vow
What I may have searched I couldn't reach
I've had it all in you

I held your love right in my hands
Along with your vow
Turning away for glory and fame
Now left me a dying fool
