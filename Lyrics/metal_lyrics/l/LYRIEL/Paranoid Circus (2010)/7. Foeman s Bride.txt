[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

Black like the rose
That fell on the floor
Near to your toes
In days before

Black like the night
In her ivory tower
In her darkest hour
All words are so trite

Kindred in mind
Connate to the core
Granded and blessed by his light
So he must be the one to show me
How to live and never die

Oh my dear, it's time to step aside
Be aware! You've become your foeman's bride
The higher you will go, the deeper you can fall
So close your eyes and let the darkness call

Black like wet stones
After a sudden rain
Your tears bemoan
The despair in vain

Black is the colour
Of my lover's eyes
Black that ain't cover
My time still runs dry

Captured in mind
Deprived of the marrow
Enslaved and constrained by his light
So now he is the one to show that
Lover's eyes are black and they can lie!

Oh my dear, it's time to step aside
Be aware! You've become your foeman's bride
The higher you will go, the deeper you can fall
So close your eyes and let the darkness call

Oh my dear, it's time to step aside
Be aware! You've become your foeman's bride
You've gone the highest way, you'll fall into disease
So close your eyes and let the darkness seize
