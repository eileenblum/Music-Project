[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

Finally he planned the step, leaving all behind
Leaving home and well-known ground
For a new world to be found
Cause it has been his dearest wish
Since he was young
To travel around the world, to be fancy-free
But every time he set a date there was a little something to care about
So he never left

Don't look at me that way
I cannot tell why you're still messing up
It is a miracle that you will fail
When a dream comes true
And every time you fall
In the first moment you think you can fly
But you are not a bird and life is catching up as you know

Not too young and so in love and perfectly close
But yet no answer in her heart
When he came to propose
So she said she needed time
But as she hesitated, he knew so well
Time was not his friend
Time went by without a word
And he was not the man to ask again
Eventually he left

Don't look at me that way
I cannot tell why you're still messing up
It is a miracle that you will fail
When a dream comes true
And every time you fall
In the first moment you think you can fly
But you are not a bird and life is catching up as you know

You're Mr Significant, always on the run
Busy as a man can be
Never time for your son
Your absence was a heavy weight
No one can bear a lifetime of ignorance
So he turned away
And one day you came to see
That he grew up
And you missed the biggest part
A stranger to his world

So my friend you're fallible
Sometimes up and sometimes down
The spiteful wheel of Fortuna

Don't give up it's not your fault
Sometimes up and sometimes down
The spiteful wheel of Fortuna

Don't look at me that way
I cannot tell why you're still messing up
It is a miracle that you will fail
When a dream comes true
And every time you fall
In the first moment you think you can fly
But you are not a bird and life is catching up as you know!

Don't look at me that way
I cannot tell why you're still messing up
It is a miracle that you will fail
When a dream comes true
And every time you fall
In the first moment you think you can fly
But you are not a bird and life is catching up
