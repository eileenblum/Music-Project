[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

Sleep well sweet child
I am here to watch your dreams
Don't be afraid
The moon above just gleams for you
Don't mind the wolf, he is not near
He's a friend of the night, my dear
Hush don't you cry, he is not near
We are friends of the night, my dear

And I run and I hide in the dark
Threatened by each distant bark
Sleep little love, for heaven's sake
It's not your fault; it's your cruel, ruthless fate
It's not your fault; it's your cruel, ruthless fate

Prophecy of the old age
Still sounding out my son's decline
He is the one to free us from the tyrant
So I flee from bloodhounds eager to kill

(And I sing) / (Sleep well sweet child)
I am here to watch your dreams
Don't be afraid,
The moon above just gleams for you
Don't mind the wolf, he is not near
He's a friend of the night, my dear
Hush don't you cry, he is not near
We are friends of the night, my dear

They shall not get my loving child
As long as I am by his side
I am the shadow runner in time
Here and there, never to find
Here and there, never to find

And I run and I hide in the dark
Threatened by each distant bark
Sleep little love, for heaven's sake
Sleep for I'm here to fulfil your fate
Sleep for I'm here to fulfil your fate
