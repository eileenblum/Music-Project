[Lyrics by: Jessica Thierjung]

Frontier runner between worlds
That's my talent and my bane
Every one's demonize me
Fear for live every day
Catch the torchlight no one takes care of my unawakened soul

They stand side by side
Well prepared for the monster that's me, I'm disgraced
This is the clannish pride
Their flambeaus light the way to the stake
I will burn

Burn heathen burn
