[Lyrics by: Linda Laukamp]

And the night that you left me
Was the dawn of a warm, wonderful summer day
Promised roses and sunshine
Washing anger and heartaches away
So I opened the door, let the sun â in his grace -
Clear the dust all around
And in shimmery light I could see
All the trash and the waste on the ground

The picture of us
Fell off the wall when you bashed the door
I changed the glass
Hung it up once more
I remember a time
When a kiss could heal the world's disdain
I'll miss the bliss we had, I'll miss the pain
So long, my love
So long, my love

The porcelain vase you broke in a fight
I found every shard and I fixed it quite right

Then I saw the windows
Misty with spite that I threw
All the years, now and then
Over things I don't even know
And I see I was wrong
And I'm willing to gather those tears
That I cried and I wash the dead panes
Till again they are bright
So you see I am sorry and it wasn't all right

A last twist with the broom, crossways the room
Then I looked at my work and here's what I saw

It's the room that we shared
For so long; all the good, all the bad time's in here
Though you left with half of it
There is still enough memory to bear
But I burnished and furnished
Mend what was broken, repaired furniture
I arranged everything perfectly
My last gift to the treasure we are

It's the key with your name
I wear on a string by my heart
When I know it is there
We're not so far apart
I remember a time
When a kiss could heal the world's disdain
I'll miss the bliss we had, I'll miss the pain
So long, my love

It's the key with your name
I wear on a string by my heart
When I know it is there
We're not so far apart.
I have to leave, lock the room for it was not meant to be
But I hope one day you'll visit it with me
So long, my love
