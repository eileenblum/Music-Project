Sleep now in the fire
it's burning high, it's stoking hopes and fears
Sleep now in the fire
you lit for yourself
Call on me, little darling
and I will wake you up from this dream

So, at last, we will cross
our souls will meet
When the seas will run dry
and the lands will die
We are children in time
we grow old each day
Repentance is a path
That we can not walk for long, my dear

For seven days and nights
I have watched you sleeping tight
Come with me and I will show you how to choose a side

So, at last, we will cross
our souls will meet
When the seas will run dry
and the lands will die
We are children in time
we grow old each day
Repentance is a path
That we can not walk, my dear

Ease your mind in the wind
It's on your side, it's like the truest friend
It is telling you a tale
Of a place so beautiful
Let it be your guidance
And it will wake you up from this dream

So, at last, we will cross
our souls will meet
When the seas will run dry
and the lands will die
We are children in time
we grow old each day
Repentance is a path
That we can not walk for long

And at last we will meet in your dreams
