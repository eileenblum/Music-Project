As we walked side by side
I saw the wind in your hair
As it stroked your skin
I knew of your despair

Darling, why are you sad?
When I am near
Is it my fault that you shed those tears?

As we walked side by side
You took my hand
But your touch,
I couldn't feel,

So I turned my head around
To see your eyes,
They were grey, they looked through me
In a world so fey, (my dear)

Near and far, colorful but pale,
beautiful with sin, never to be seen
We're divided, we are standing on opponent sides
You complete me, you delete me
And in you I hide

As I lay by your side,
I felt your heart
Beating in line with mine
As I lay by your side â by your side, dear

I said I needed you
You just looked into my eyes,
Your voice was in disguise:

âLet us walk side by side,
I'll hold your hand,
I am here with you, (my dear)

Near and far, colorful but pale,
beautiful with sin, never to be seen
We're divided, we are standing on opponent sides
You complete me, you delete me
And in you I hide
