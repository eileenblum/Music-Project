You left in the fall when all the leaves decay 
And I didn't know...

The night, the dark, the moonlight in your burning eyes
And now you're back to haunt my soul, to take my will
You are the one who never fears a broken mind
Your hands can touch the innocence in me, 
and tear it all apart so I am free.

There was a time and you were near to me 
Your hand, my face in perfect enmity
And I grow a precious white lily 
for every moment I treasured so dearly 

We play a game that I am not allowed to win
You role the dice and game away my pride

There was a time and you were near to me
Your hand, my face in perfect enmity
And I grow a precious white lily 
for every moment I treasured so dearly on your grave.

Lowland, black trees no chance to hide my tortured soul. 
I placed my lips like roses on your snow-white skin
My strength in vain for you'll be all I ever aim:
Your hands can touch the innocence in me.

There was a time and you were near to me
Your hand, my face in perfect enmity
And I grow a precious white lily 
for every moment I treasured so dearly

[Bridge:]
There're shadows on the wall. How dare you to come back.
When you left you went so far, so far... How can I follow?
