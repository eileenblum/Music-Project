[Digipack Bonus Track]Near Banbridge town, in the County Down
One morning last July
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by.

She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
oh, for see I was really there

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
And from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair colleen
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped sure I scratched my head
And I looked with a feeling rare
And I says, says I, to a passerby
"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"

He smiled at me, and he says, says he,
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the star of the County Down."

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
And from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair Colleen
That I met in the County Down.

At the Harvest fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
Forn a smile from my nut-brown rose.

No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust-colored brown
Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
And from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the fair colleen
That I met in the County Down.
