All the different, noisy, loud and harsh
Voices in my head, they follow me, to break me down
Oh I can't resist a single one, tempting me to stay, to see,
To give and I obey

When I change my mind
They are holding on to me and
Pushing me into water,
Cold and dark and beautiful
I am not alone,
They are with me in my time of need,
In me

Quiet is the tempting sea and beautiful
Her dark and cold embrace
Peacefully I breathe the need to be with her
And taste her grace
Quiet is the tempting sea and beautiful
Her dark and cold embrace
Peacefully I breathe the need to be with her
And taste her grace

First I thought that I might waste my life
Listening to the voices in my head I don't resist.
But with every day I know there is
Something more behind each wasted life
So I obey.

When I change my mind
They are holding on to me and
Pushing me into water,
Cold and dark and beautiful
I am not alone,
They are with me in my time of need,
In me

Quiet is the tempting sea and beautiful
Her dark and cold embrace
Peacefully I breathe the need to be with her
And taste her grace
Quiet is the tempting sea and beautiful
Her dark and cold embrace
Peacefully I breathe the need to be with her
And taste her grace
