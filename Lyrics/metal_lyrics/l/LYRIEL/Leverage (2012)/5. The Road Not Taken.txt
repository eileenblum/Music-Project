Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made, has made all the difference.

Oh, I, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
Shall I come back?

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made, has made all the difference.
