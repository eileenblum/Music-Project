Invading our ancient Lands
Revealing no Respect
Rape, plunder and pillage
No choice but to fight back
Until The end
Defend our Land
Burning our ancient Countries
Politicians selling out
So whereâs your World Peace?
Canât you hear the displeased Crowd?
Until The end
Defend our Land
Oi! Oi! Oi! Fighting Breed
Oi! Oi! Oi! You and me
Oi! Oi! Oi! War in the Street
Media choke our cry
Tomorrow could be too late
The Masses watch and stand by
From within they (Fundamentalists) spread their Hate
Until The end
Defend our Land
Oi! Oi! Oi! Fighting Breed
Oi! Oi! Oi! You and me
Oi! Oi! Oi! War in the Street
Until the End, Defend Our Land!!
Protect and Survive!
