Being Patriot considered a crime, that much we all know
Ruled by the Politically Correct, masses go with that flow
Smash them up! Smash them up!
But if tomorrow this countryâs under attack, who do you think will show?
Not this P.C. brigade, huh! This I do Avow!
Smash them up! Smash them up!
It takes people like you and me, to take a stand
A minority not afraid, of being condemned!
Smash them up! Smash them up!
The Chosen few offering the Nation, a helping hand
If not for us our civilization, would be truly damned!
Smash them up! Smash them up!

[Chorus:]
P.C. Brigade! So tired of You!
P.C. Brigade! Screw You!
P.C. Brigade! So tired of You!
P.C. Brigade! Iâm not a Part of you!
P.C. Brigade! So tired of You!
P.C. Brigade! Screw You!
P.C. Brigade! So tired of You!
P.C. Brigade! Iâm not a Part of you!
No more safety on the streets, (P.C.) lobby fights lobby fight patriots instead patriots instead
Politicians who dare to speak, get bullets in the head
Smash them up! Smash them up!
Crime ruling the European streets, dealers pushing death!
Those, they should try to beat! Huh! But they hunt US down instead!
Smash them up! Smash them up!
P.C. Brigade!!! P.C. Brigade!!!
