And here I stand with my back against the Wall
One against many, Alone facing All
Strong in Numbers, harassing their favourite Game
But if police turns up, Skinheads take the Blame
Skinhead! Skinhead!
Street Fight! Street Fight!
Skinhead! Skinhead!
We are no Angels, A Factâs a Fact
But codes of Honour we do respect
True, under Attack we stand tall, we fight Back
But Rape and Crime not our way and thatâs a Fact
Skinhead! Skinhead!
Street Fight! Street Fight!
Skinhead! Skinhead!
Dealing with Prejudice, shot from all sides
Therefore stand together, we must unite
Tired of wasting my time on senseless fights
Firm but fair, reveal Skinhead Pride
Skinhead! Skinhead!
Street Fight! Street Fight!
Skinhead! Skinhead!
Honour!
The scene divided, sad but true
Fighting amongst each other, I wonder whatâs the point?
When unity is the approach of a clever crew
(Internal) conflict not the path of the Chosen Few
