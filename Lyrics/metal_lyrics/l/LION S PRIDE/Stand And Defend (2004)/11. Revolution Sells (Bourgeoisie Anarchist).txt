Hammers and Sickles, Che Guevara shirts
Red Star flags, Capitalism the hated word
Red Khmer symbols, so proud in your Stalin shirt
While accepting the money of the system you wish to hurt

[Pre Chorus:]
Revolution Sells!
Revolution Sells!

[Chorus:]
A Working Class Hero, You claim to be
An Upper Class Brat is what You really are
Posing like a Rebel, You canât Fool Me!
Take Away your Cash, You wonât go far!
Preaching Revolution, Anarchy and Change
While you never lived the System you always praise
Your own Land and Folk you love to Betray
Your own history denied, always chose the opposite way

[Pre Chorus:]
Revolution Sells!
Revolution Sells!

[Chorus:]
A Working Class Hero, You claim to be
An Upper Class Brat is what You really are
Posing like a Rebel, You canât Fool Me!
Take Away your Cash, You wonât go far!
Oh indeed, you have seen the Light
Patronise everyone, only your view is right
Born from rich Parents, University type
Your doctrine killed millions despite your hype

[Pre Chorus:]
Revolution Sells!
Revolution Sells!

[2nd Chorus:]
A cry for freedom you call your strife
But another opinion cannot be right
Cashing in from the system you claim to fight
Living like millionaires, now does that feel alright?
