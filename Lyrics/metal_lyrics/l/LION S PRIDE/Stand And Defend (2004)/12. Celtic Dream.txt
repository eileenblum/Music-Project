I dream of a Better World
Where Tradition and Codes Prevail
Where our History is being told
And Where Crime and Cruelty Fail

[Chorus:]
Dream, One needs to hold on to A Dream
Hope, For a better place for You and Me
Remembering, the Ancient Druidsâ Path, A Celtic Dream
Splendour, Nature in Full Glory like it used to be
I hope for a Healthy Youth
A Place where Families do Connect
Where Folk are loyal to their Roots
And the Elder receive Respect

[Chorus:]
Dream, One needs to hold on to A Dream
Hope, For a better place for You and Me
Remembering, the Ancient Druidsâ Path, A Celtic Dream
Splendour, Nature in Full Glory like it used to be
Celtic!
Celtic Dream!
Celtic!
Celtic!
Celtic Dream!
Celtic!
Where Nature is being preserved
And our children are being taught
Respect for Life in a world less perverse
Where true Values cannot be bought

[Chorus:]
Dream, One needs to hold on to A Dream
Hope, For a better place for You and Me
Remembering, the Ancient Druidsâ Path, A Celtic Dream
Splendour, Nature in Full Glory like it used to be
Wishing for A Land of the Free
Safe to Walk the Streets without A Gun
Where our tribes live in Harmony
And all this injustice is undone

[Chorus:]
Dream, One needs to hold on to A Dream
Hope, For a better place for You and Me
Remembering, the Ancient Druidsâ Path, A Celtic Dream
Splendour, Nature in Full Glory like it used to be
Dream!
