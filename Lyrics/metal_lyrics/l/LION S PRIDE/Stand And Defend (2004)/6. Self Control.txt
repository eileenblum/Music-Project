Self Control!
People have a choice in life
Free from any addiction truly is a noble strive
This is a free world, I know and I do accept
But committing crimes in order to score, now what do you expect?
This is a free world, I know and I do accept
But committing crimes in order to score, now what do you expect?
Pity? Pity?

[Chorus:]
Clear head, Clear Mind!
In order to be Free
Clear Head, Clear Mind
I take that liberty!!!
Self Control!
High on Crack, joining gangs seems cool
Seems to be standard, even at school
But a dirty needle in my veins surely not my way
As I hope to live yet, yet another day
But a dirty needle in my veins surely not my way
As I hope to live yet, yet Another Day!
Yet Another Day! Yet Another Day!
I take that liberty!
Sniff your coke, swallow your pills
On your constant search for cheap thrills
But bear in mind not, not to bother me
As I do not relate and feel No sympathy
But bear in mind not, not to bother me
As I do not relate and feel No sympathy
No Sympathy! No Sympathy!

[Chorus:]
Clear head, Clear Mind!
In order to be Free
Clear Head, Clear Mind
I take that liberty!
