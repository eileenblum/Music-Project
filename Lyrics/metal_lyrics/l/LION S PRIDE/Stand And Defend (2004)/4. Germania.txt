Oh my Beloved Land
Upon Thee No Woe
Awaiting like A Gentle Friend
Wherever I may Go
Green Vast Forests
Fill my Lungs with Life
North, South, East or West
Winter Cold (cuts) like a Knife

[Chorus:]
Germania, Germania!
Where my Forefathers dwelt
Germania, Germania!
Of Thy Blood I descend
Our North Sea Gives,
Our North Sea Takes,
Oh Ancient Germania,
My Land of A Thousand Lakes
Behold our Grey Skies
Where Odin Reigns
They match the Colour of our Eyes
Winter, Frost, Eternal Rain!

[Chorus:]
Germania, Germania!
Where my Forefathers dwelt
Germania, Germania!
Of Thy Blood I descend
Life often very hard
In this World of Snow
Forever Engraved in my Heart
Where Northern Winds Blow
Oh my Beloved Land
Upon Thee No Woe
Awaiting like A Gentle Friend
Wherever I may Go

[Chorus:]
Germania, Germania!
Where my Forefathers dwelt
Germania, Germania!
Of Thy Blood I descend
Where my Forefathers dwelt
Of Thy Blood I descend
Where my Forefathers dwelt
Of Thy Blood I descend
Of Thy Blood I descend!
