Could you offer me a few minutes of your time
It wonât take long, I am not the type to whine
Let me tell you about this late friend of mine
Imagine a brother you never had, a comrade very fine

[Chorus:]
Friendship, Loyalty, Brotherhood
Few words needed, we understood
Sincerity, Honesty, One of a kind
Offering Qualities which are too hard to find
Despite his age this lad was mature and fair
Life is hard, everyone has his own cross to bear
But when he died the bloke was only eighteen
Quite unfair huh? Too much still to be seen!

[Chorus:]
Friendship, Loyalty, Brotherhood
Few words needed, we understood
Sincerity, Honesty, One of a kind
Offering Qualities which are too hard to find
Many years have passed and heâs still in my mind
You see, true friendship after all is very hard to find
If I have bothered you, I do apologise
blame it on the hour, blame it on the beer or the wine

[Chorus:]
Friendship, Loyalty, Brotherhood
Few words needed, we understood
Sincerity, Honesty, One of a kind
Offering Qualities which are too hard to find
