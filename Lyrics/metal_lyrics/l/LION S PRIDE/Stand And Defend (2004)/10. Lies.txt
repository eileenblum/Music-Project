Press telling lies, Always twisting Facts
A way I despise, ruled by the politically correct
Portraying us like Scum, Their idea of fun?
People believing Lies, How can they be so dumb?

[Chorus:]
Press telling lies, Always twisting Facts
A way I despiseâ¦
TV News to brainwash the masses, Propaganda never fails
Even complex clashes presented like Fairytales
Good versus bad, as if Life was Black or White
In fact all very sad, Hearing only One Side

[Chorus:]
Press telling lies, Always twisting Facts
A way I despise, Lies! Lies! Lies! Lies!
Insulting our intelligence, offering twisted truth
This all makes no Sense, But Lies do go down smooth,
Justifying bombings, civilians under attack
World Leaders as Big Brother, victims canât fight back
Press telling lies, Always twisting Facts
A way I despiseâ¦
All in the name of democracy, small countries without a choice
Prefer to call it lunacy, they can always send down âthe boysâ
Who are you to judge? If Independence is our strife
Is freedom asked too much? When we fight for our Rights?

Press telling lies, Always twisting Facts
A way I despise, LIES! LIES! LIES! LIES!
