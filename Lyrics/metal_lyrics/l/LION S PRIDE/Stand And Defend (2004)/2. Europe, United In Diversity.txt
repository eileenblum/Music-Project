Forever engraved in our Hearts
Our Ancestors Noble and Pure
Building our Europe, under conditions hard
Body and Soul conditioned to endure

[Pre Chorus:]
Europe, United United!
Ancient Lands United in Diversity!!!
Earned Through Blood, Sweat and Tears
For our Freedom and our Wealth
Their Ancient War cry I still can hear
Germanic, Hellenic or Celt

[Pre Chorus:]
Europe, United United!
Ancient Lands United in Diversity!!!
Unite! Unite! Unite!
Unite! Unite! Unite!

[Chorus:]
Hated and refused, mostly by the own kind
History re-written, ancient rights denied
Politicians twisting facts, turning the masses blind
So one often wonders, for whom our forefathers died
Slavonian, Roman, Iberian or Gaul
Empires and tribes did bravely defend
Civilisation and Europe the Highest Goal
Never deny your roots, Flag in the hand!

[Pre Chorus:]
Europe, United United!
Ancient Lands United in Diversity!!!

[Chorus:]
Hated and refused, mostly by the own kind
History re-written, ancient rights denied
Politicians twisting facts, turning the masses blind
So one often wonders for whom our forefathers died
