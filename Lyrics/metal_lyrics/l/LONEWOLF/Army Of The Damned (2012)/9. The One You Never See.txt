I am eternal victory
I cannot be defeated
I rule your death your glory
Immortal and unexpected
Shadows and light
I rule you must obey
Master of all fate and time
Your destiny is in my hands
For I am the one who decides when you must die
I am the one you never see
The ruler of eternity
I am the ice cold bony hand
Of the one with hood and scythe
I decide the miracle
Of birth and death and your whole life
