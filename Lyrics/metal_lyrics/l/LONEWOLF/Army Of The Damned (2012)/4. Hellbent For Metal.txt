Give me the power and might
Give me the darkness and the light
Iâm a soldier a renegade
Give the strength to stand and fight
I rule the prayers of iron
I trust in steel the oath Iâve sworn
Iâm a born metalian
Iâd rather die than to be a slave
I am what I am and I am metal
We are what we are and we are metal
I am what I am and I am metal
We are what we are hellbent for metal
The metalianâs prayer
To the glory of iron and steel
The slaveâs avenger
The taste of freedom is revealed
The lords of hell obey
Our rules and our fate
The children of the night
Are one legion ready to rise
