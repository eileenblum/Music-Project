Stone after stone defeat after defeat
He was caught in the dark
He hoped to find a secure shelter
They looked so harmless and took his hand
They chewed him up and then spit him out
They raped his soul
He became a lamb a faceless robot
Trapped in the watchtowerâs claws
Donât be a fool, deny their rules
The snakeâs behind open your eyes
And be aware they want the control
Of your mind and of your soul
Soulereapers
