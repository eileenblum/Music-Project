The coffins are open
Bony hands curse the fog
They rise above their graves â bloodthirsty souls
Their skin so pale and white
Their eyes of blackest black
Vampires of society are hunting through the land
Out of the night
Out of the dark
Sly from behind
They seek your fall
They enter your mind
They blind your eyes
They want you faceless
In their rows
They wanna feast upon your soul
You shall become one of their spawns
Soul cannibals on the prowl
Beware of their evil claws
Tally ho! Heads are gonna roll
They rule with a stonecold heart
Warlocks of the plot
Weak minds are their prey to gain power
Stand for what you are
And not what they want you to be
Stand strong and youâll escape
Your brainâs lobotomy
