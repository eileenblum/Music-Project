We are the last defenders
Last ones to stand in line
When all hope seems lost
Our allegiance our reason to fight
Itâs good day to die
With honor and pride
Through the debris and the ruins
Our faith burns so bright
The devil can take us down
Down to the world below
The whole world can condemn us
We donât care after all
The devil can take us down
Down to the world below
The whole world can condemn us
We still smile when we fall
Our allies have surrendered
Now we stand alone
The enemy will not hail
Victory now â weâre not gone
Still we sing and hail
Tunes of war and glory
Thereâs no master thereâs no God
Above an order to follow
