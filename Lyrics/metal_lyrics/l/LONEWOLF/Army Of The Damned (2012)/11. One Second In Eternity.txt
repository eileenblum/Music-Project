When I look into the mirror
There is someone that I see
A man who has got true friends
As well as enemies
And I know darkness so well
But also the light
And believe me when I say
I know whatâs worth the fight
The warriorâs rest
When he won in the end
How great can be
One second in eternity
I am always fighting for
For what I believe is right
And of course some bad mistakes
I have already made
But at least Iâm not faceless
I got my own pride
And I am the only one
To master my own fate
