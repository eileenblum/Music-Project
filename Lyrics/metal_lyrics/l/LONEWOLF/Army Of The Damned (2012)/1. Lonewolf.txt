This fuckinâ band was born
As a tribute to metal
Without pretending
We live our pssion
Some will always say
âLeave the 80s ehre they areâ
I tell you we donât care
Cause thatâs what we stand for
Weâre not as proud of lonewolf
As we are proud of you
Cause if weâre still around
We owe it only to you
Youâre the wolfâs metal soul
Through raging waters and through storms
Still we are going on
Preaching the iron religion
And we will defend true metal âtil the end
Lonewolf
