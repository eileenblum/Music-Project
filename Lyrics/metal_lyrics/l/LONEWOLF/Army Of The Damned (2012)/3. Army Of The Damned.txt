Conquerors of the eastern world
An army all thought invincible
We run straight into a frozen hell
Defeated by snow blizzard and ice
Forgotten are the dreams of glory
Thinking of home is the warmest memory
Trapped in this white and cold cemetery
I still can walk God seems to like me
I feel so cold
Maybe Iâm already dead
I still march on
Long is the way home
Frozen dreams in a frozen land
Hell awaits the army of the damned
Lifeless ice cold I must carry on
A desperate energy the will to survive
What will I find if I manage to come home?
Will I be strong enough to face death?
What I saw what I went through
Made me choke forevermore
My soul died here in the endless steppes
With all these men devoured
By the Russian land
