One voice is calling
The beast begins to breathe
Seductive and sly
And no one will ask why
They follow one by one
Earning power getting strong
In those darkest days
No return itâs too late
Crawling to hell
Where the evil dwells
Crawling to hell
In to the demonâs lair
German hell patrol
Bringer of war
German hell patrol
In to war!
The horizon is red
Hope is lost and dead
Hell might be sweet
Compared to human deeds
The spiral of horror
Takes everyone away
They opened hellâs door
Sealed a generationâs fate
German hell patrol
Bringer of war
German hell patrol
In to war!
The throne of evil has taken the crown
Whirlwind of hell will take millions of souls
A march through the darkness lies ahead
Crawling to hell
The throne of evil has taken the crown
Whirlwind of hell will take millions of souls
A march through the darkness lies ahead
The whole world is crawling to hell
