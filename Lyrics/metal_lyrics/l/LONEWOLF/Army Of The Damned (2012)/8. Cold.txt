They are lurking somewhere in the dark
Eden isnât safe from their attack
Evil has got the upper hand

Light and peace are forever damned
Demons rise to take you below
Hellfire burns your soul
Thereâs no escape from those evil claws
My heart is black my soul so cold
I feel so faceless heartless soul
Dreams and values seem to be gone
When you donât expect it comes the fall
Left alone you ask for the point of it all
And when you think you made it
There is always a price to pay
In the end the demon wins
There is no use to hope and pray
Demons rise to take you below
Hellfire burns your soul
Thereâs no escape from those evil claws
My heart is black my soul so cold
I feel so faceless heartless soul
Dreams and values seem to be gone
When you expect it least there comes the fall
Left alone you ask for the point of it all
In the end the evil takes it all
No escape from the final fall
All is written â written in black
Whatever the joy â youâll pay it back
Cold
I feel so cold
