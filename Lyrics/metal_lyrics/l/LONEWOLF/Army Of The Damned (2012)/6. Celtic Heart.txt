Now that my life is fading away
Let me take you into my arms
Listen my son the tale of my life
How I became the man I was
Hear the call of destiny
Deep inside your soul
A raging stream of liberty
Rising from above
To live or to die life has no meaning
If you live in slavery
Follow your heart make your own path
We are free men my son
Now time has come to say farewell
And to live my human cell
Donât cry no tears my spirit lives on
And youâll never be alone
Hear the call of destiny
Deep inside your soul
A raging stream of liberty
Rising from above
To live or to die life has no meaning
If you live in slavery
Follow your heart make your own path
We are free men my son
A warrior is gone
We lost one of our sons
A new one is born
Celtic spirit lives on
