Reading in their crystal ball, their holy icon of lies.And they see what youwanna see, and they hear what you wanna hear.Still they are making theirprofit of weakness and the sadnessOf poor men who have lost all hope, allfaith and will to live. Sneaking in-deep in mind and soul,Deceitfully-sohigh's the fall Sly-Divine art of liesLie-Divine art of lies Vicious,sly, they're addicted to the desperation of men,They're making amounts ofmoney from cruel desolation.Those bastards are becoming rich with modernslavery,It's a shame to see those thieves in the 21th century.
