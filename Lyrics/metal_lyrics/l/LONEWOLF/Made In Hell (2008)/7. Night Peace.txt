Now the last rays of daylight died
And thedark brought it's mysteries
The curtain felt on the other side
Now another life is to begin

In the peace of night
They rise from the other side
Those strange feelings
Of their ancestral might

In the peace of night
Echoes of ancient times
As all stands still they come back to life

Remember all those ferrytales
Are so close they're near to come true
Glorius warriors magic princesses
Bards and wizards
They're near to touch you
