Like thousand little fausts
Who sold their souls to hell
Utopic promises
In a web of lies they dwell
In our society each day
More men get lost
That's when the evil
Strikes to grow it's rows

He says that he has seen them
That he's the chosen one
To show all ânon-hereticsâ the way
Propaganda shameless
Lies about human clonage
Can't his fellows see that he's insane?

Wipe him out â the devil's tongue
No â still he says:

âForget thy god 'cause I, I am he
I am the one who will save your souls
They'll be drowned in flames
We will rise on judgement dayâ
Oh can't thay see: Black heaven calls

We are nothing more
Than shit for those fools
Until we oren our wallet
An join their crowd
Becoming reacher everyday
From constant robbery
His fellows still only
Have dreams to hold on
