Dressed in leather spikes and chains
He appears in the dark
Mighty and proud
Rebel at heart
They call him an animal
Who's going stray
He doesn't give a damn
'Cause his heart leads his way

If there's a last man to stand
He'll be the one holding the flag
He's a metal warrior
Streams of passion rule his heart

Made in hell

He's a wolf not a lamb
Screaming âI'm aliveâ
Can they just tell the same
Of their own life?
All their boring standards
Always blinded their eyes
And they will never know
What freedom's like

More than a fuckin' religion
Heavy metal's a way of life
He's a metal warrior
Made of steel made of pride

Made in hell
