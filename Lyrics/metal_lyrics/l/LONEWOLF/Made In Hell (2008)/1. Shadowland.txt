Dealing with evil, shaking the reaper's hand,You sold him your soul, now heseals your fate.The poison in your blood soon took all control,In the realmof shadows, on the razor's edge you crawl. The phantom's reflect in yourmirror;The phantom of whom you were before.It's not too late, turn back thewheel,And avoid this awfull fall.The phantom's reflect in your mirror;Thephantom of whom you were before.It's not too late, time's getting short,Andhard will be the road. Black trip in hell through shadowlandRoamingwithout aim through shadowland Now, what's the use in your "search forfreedom",You'll never be free addicted to the needle.You enter this world,the realm of the slaves,The eternal fall, you dig your own grave.
