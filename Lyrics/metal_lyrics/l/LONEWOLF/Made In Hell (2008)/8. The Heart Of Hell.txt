They are marching on
They are bound all three as one
Like eternal lovers
One couldn't live without the others
Religion gave birth to madness
Policy power's greed
The army massive killings
Unholy trinity

And they lead us straight into war

In the heart of hell
Corruption hate and treason follow their way
In the heart of hell
The demon made it's lair right down on earth

The roots of evil
Have increased since far too long
The voice of the devil
Is seductive to many ones
They control their minds
Frightening secrets twist the truth
Blinding their eyes
To put the lambs into rows

Evil's not below
Awating to get your soul
Evil lives right here
Breeding into the heart of men
Men's cupidity
Is honey to the lord of flies
The unholy trinity
Is strong like never in those times
