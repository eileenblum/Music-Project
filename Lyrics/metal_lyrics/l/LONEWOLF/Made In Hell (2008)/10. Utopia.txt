Close your eyes and fly away with me
I'll show you something you never saw
Leaving the darkness behind
Enter a peaceful world of light

Into a world without pain and sorrow
Where no darkness kills the light
Where there's no fear of tomorrow
Utopia â Welcome life

A world where our children's
Future looks bright
Where the horizon is not on fire
This world will
Never be reality
But in current days
Sometimes it's good to dream
