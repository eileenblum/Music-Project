A new kind of venom
Infiltrades our society
Lost prophets Of another age
Preaching evil in their community

Afganistan and Irak
Is some fuel to feed their fire
Malicious cruel and dark
Building up their pyre

Creeping around
Something heavy's in the air
Unleased hellbound
Evil crawls out of it's lair

Rise of the dark â The New Inquisition
Leaving wounds that will never heal
Rise of the dark â The New Inquisition
Religion poisoners history

A minority of cold bastards
Declared war to the âheretic oneâ
Searching for lambs among weak minds
Fed by evil scorn

Remember the Christian strike
Phantazies of an utopic urge
They're pleading a sacred book
But perverting holy words
