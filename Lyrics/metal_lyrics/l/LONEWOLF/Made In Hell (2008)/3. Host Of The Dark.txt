Most politicians sell their ass 
Like dirty and ill whores
When money brings the power
Their own pride counts no more
If it gains some voices
They are ready to loose their face
And they would sell their own mother
To win the final race

Hidden demons face
Behind a smilling mask
Troughout the world
They spread their mark

Rulers kiss their dirty millions
While children die of starvation
They condemn it on TV
But all they want is to be seen
Caviar meal with worst dictators
Secret trades for awful wars
To sell a missile is more important
Than to help the homeless one

Poisoned soul â stonecold heart
Sly and mean -  the host of the dark
The host of the dark
