Now the time has come
For us to leave the shores
We'll sail onwards
Our faith pushes us on
Heeding the great call of the wild
Nothing feels like this
We hail the wind and liberty
Bound to freedom we are eternally

And we're laughing into death's face
On the wings of freedom we ride
Forever â mighty urge
We'll never change our course

There's nothing what could
Hold us back down on land
Unbound unchained
Our destiny's on high seas
And no god and no master
No evil entity
Will ever force, force us down
Bound to glory we are eternally
