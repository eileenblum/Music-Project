In the distance roars the thunder
Black horizon is born
Flashes of lightning devour the sky
Who knows what will come?

Free from the start, we know who we are
We will follow the sacred path
Passion leads our hearts
We know what we want 
Heavy metal is our promised land

We were born to ride with the winds
Like an eagle proud and wild
Into the storm, we strike and we fight
The hordes of the night

Show me the horns, our allegience
You proud metalhead
Spikes and leather shine like an armor
Ready for bloodshed
