Ten thousand holy crusaders
Are marching off to the south
They conquer new lands
They all spill blood in the name of their lord

Burning, hanging, killing, mutilate
All these sins are allowed by the church
Abjure your faith, die by the sword
Eradicate the heretic, absolution is granted

We pray to the same god
As our enemies
Mysterium fidei
A bloodlusty army
By the will of the pope
We march on
Killing and burning
In the name of the same cross

Kill 'em all, let god sort 'em out
He'll recognize his own
Murders in the name of the one and only god
Aberration is history's lot
