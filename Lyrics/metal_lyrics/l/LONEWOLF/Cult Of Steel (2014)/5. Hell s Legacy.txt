We are losing all of our dreams
And everything we hold on to
We don't fight for tomorrow
And we are dying today

Selfish loss of humanity
Heavy crosses to carry
A tornado of lost souls
Evil harvests its seed

Hell's legacy

Governments of corrupted whores
Their fellow's media twist the truth
They divert your attention
For you to know and see nothing

The lambs just focus of futility
While the whole world is drowned into hell
Open your eyes before it's too late
Wake up and fight this dreadful end
