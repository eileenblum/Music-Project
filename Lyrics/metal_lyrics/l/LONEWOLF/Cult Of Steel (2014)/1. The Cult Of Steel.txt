Their mortal shell may be dead
But their souls still live on
Through our minds and through our hearts
They're the army of immortals

Now Quorthon has entered the hall up high
And Chris leads the power of the night
Lee forever trusts in the fire
And Ronnie found the sacred heart

I hail - the cult of steel
You hail - the cult of steel
We hail - the cult of steel
The cult of steel

They branded pieces of eternity
Well known or underground
Each one has built the altar
Of the religion we're bound to

Now Jon is storming the light's bane
And Ingo is riding the sky
Clive is forever running free
And J.D. sounds the battle cry
