Crawling through hell, we'l crawl back
And we'll return with the demon's head
Those who won't die will be stronger
We raise our banners with pride and honor

We hail the gods, almighty lords

Open fire - we will burn 'em down
Fire - to the ground
Fire - we will burn 'em down
Fire - to the ground
Many will die, cause evil is strong
We won't return until the mission is done

Faith in believes, force of our will
We've got faith in justice and freedom
