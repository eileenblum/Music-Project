Higher
The flames are licking the sky
The fires of evil
Are burning bright
Evil
That holy men do
In the name of god
A maiden is doomed

Holy war's terror, it's the same old song again
The root of evil's raging pain
The reaper laughs, a skinless smile
His claws control man's mind

Blood of the heretic
Bloodstained altar of freedom
Blood of the heretic
Spilled by the evil

Fires
The smoke is coming down
Madness of evil
Bomb terror
Evil
That religion breeds
In the prophet's name
Fanatic hate
