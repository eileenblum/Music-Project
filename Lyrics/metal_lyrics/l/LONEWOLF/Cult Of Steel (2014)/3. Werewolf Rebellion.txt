In the darkness of the night
Some will live and some will die
Be the prey or be the hunter

When the evil leads the world
Some will rule and some will crawl
Be king or nothing at all

Welcome the eternal night
As a gift of second sight
Turn the darkness into light

Feel the power of the night
Feed the beast you have inside
Raise the fire in your heart

Wake up the wolf
Wake up the beast within you
Wake up the werewolf in your heart
Werewolf rebellion

Try to read between the lies
What they teach you, what they hide
Truth is right before your eyes
