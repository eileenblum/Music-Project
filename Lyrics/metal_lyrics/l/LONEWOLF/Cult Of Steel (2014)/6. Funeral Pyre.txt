Beware of the masses
And what they think is right
When their eyes are blind by the light
Safer in the darkness than in your world of lies
The wise man trusts the fool to survive

Far away from the sun
Finally I see
Master of my destiny

Far away from your chains
Finally I am free
Take your chance and follow me

A light in the darkness
A pyre in the night
The flames will burn the chains of mankind

A cure for the madness
A true guiding light
The funeral pyre of mankind

Free from your brightness, my eyes are open wide
Two realities collide
Let the flames of wisdom purify the shame
Of a world that's gone insane
