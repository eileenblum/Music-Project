Shall I sail forever on
And never look back
How can I face those regrets
Aching in my heart

Some wounds will never heal
And time cannot help
Passing hours, days and years
Some pain will last

Warrior - forging an armor
Warrior - emotions to hide
Scars hurt the soul
But feed the force to fight

You'd better be strong
'Cause destiny calls
Rise above the ashes
And learn from the past

You build your own temple
The power of a god
No use crying all alone
It's up to you to carry on
