Forty thousand men
Sent aboard U-Boats
To challenge the Royal Navy

Less than ten thousand
Will return back home
From the Atlantic's claws of death

The grey wolves - tragic memory
The grey wolves - hunt through the sea
The grey wolves - iron coffins
The grey wolves - monsters of steel

Desperate struggles
Claustrophobia
Living in a grave under the sea

Boredom and illness
Bravery, brothers
In a disaster to foresee
