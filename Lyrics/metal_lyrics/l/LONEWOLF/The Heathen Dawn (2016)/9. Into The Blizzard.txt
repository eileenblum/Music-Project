I walk alone to this place I called home
My body's dead, but I still carry on
I don't know why
I came back from the dead
Is my soul damned?
If god is a joker I'm his fool 'tit the end

On the way hack home

Ghost with frozen bones

I am colder than the frost
I am lost in this blizzard of ice
I don't feel the wind that howls
But it cuts my flesh like a knife

My friends are dead and finally rest
Nightmare goes on, hell awaits in my head
What can you eat in a desert of snow?
Hungry for flesh, if god is a joker
I'm his fool 'til the end

On the way back home

Ghost with frozen bones

I am colder than the frost
I am lost in this blizzard of ice
I don't feel the wind that howls
But it cuts my flesh like a knife

On the way back home

Ghost with frozen bone

I am colder than the frost
I am lost in this blizzard of ice
I don't feel the wind that howls
But it cuts my flesh like a knife
