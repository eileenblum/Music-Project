Inner demons never die
They sneak around 'til they rise
Hidden somewhere in a veil of souls
'til one spark lights the fire
A poison in your soul
Be on the look out
When you think you've won
They hunt you down

Demon's the
Never really dies
Demon's fire
Gives you an everlasting fight
Demon's fire...

Your own box of Pandora
Never let them break the seal
Never forget demons you fought
'cause they just want to break free
A poison in your soul
Be on the look out
When you think you've won
They hunt you down
