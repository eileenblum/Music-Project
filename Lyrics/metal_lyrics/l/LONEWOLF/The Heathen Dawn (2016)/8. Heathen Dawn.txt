The world is on fire, men have gone insane
The soil of mother earth turns to red
Nameless massacres, deeds without a name
It's time for the dragon to lose its tongue and its head

Heathen dawn, get rid of your fears
Heathen dawn, for our liberty
A new age to come, the dawn of victory
Heathen dawn, fighting to be free

Evil the darkest kind, as innocence is slain
We don't want a world of slaves and pain
It's time to fight the fire with fire and no remorse
It's time to hunt arid kill the demon forevermore

Heathen dawn, get rid of your fears
Heathen dawn, for our liberty
A new age to come, the dawn of victory
Heathen dawn, fighting to be free
