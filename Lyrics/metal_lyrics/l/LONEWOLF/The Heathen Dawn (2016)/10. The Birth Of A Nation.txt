In the year 9 before Christ was born
Took place a battle that changed Europe
Greatest defeat ever seen of the mighty roman legions
Often seen as the birth of the German nation
Germania Magna's clans gathered and fought the invader as one

As the Roman Empire ruled on the entire world
The will to expand their might to a realm far, far beyond

Teutonic slaves became great warriors
Heads of the brave died for freedom
Out of the pain born a rebellion
To face Rome and unite a nation

Fight fight, fight the legions, rise rise Germania
Fight fight, fight the legions, rise rise Germania

Varus led his great legions
Into the enslaved clans
But Arminius was the one
Who turned his quest into darkest hell

Teutonic slaves became great warriors
Heads of the brave died for freedom
Out of the pain born a rebellion
To face Rome and unite a nation

Fight fight, fight the legions, rise rise Germania
Fight fight, fight the legions, rise rise Germania
