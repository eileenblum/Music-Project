Out of hell, diabolic breed
No human feeling left
Surrounded by death and sulphur
You are the scum of mankind

Evil sets its course
When the angels fall
Hope and faith, they are lost
When the angels fall

Like an animal you should be butchered
This is what I wish for you
No mercy if you ask me
Executed at the gallows

Evil sets its course
When the angels fall
Hope and faith, they are lost
When the angels fall

Not an ounce of pity
'til the curtain falls
Not worthy of living
You'd be better off dead
Not an ounce of pity
You bastard should be slain
You awake in me
The will to kill with hate

Evil sets its course
When the angels fall
Hope and faith, they are lost
When the angels fall

When the angels fall...
