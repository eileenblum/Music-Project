The call of the wild
Call of freedom and of pride
Raw energy to go on
Against the evil, against the storm
The beast takes control
Of your heart and soul

Spitting into the eyes of death
Each day's like if it was the last
Wolfsblut
Stormrider your last breath
Spitting into the eyes of death
Each day's like if it was the last
Stormrider 'til your last breath
Wolfsblut

Your heart is your guide
To find your way through the lies
You're not faceless, you are the one
To rule your fate and take your crown
The beast takes control
Of your heart and soul
