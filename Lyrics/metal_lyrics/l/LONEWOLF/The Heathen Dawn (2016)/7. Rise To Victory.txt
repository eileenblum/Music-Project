Facing all dreads, the struggles of life
His fellow army standing as one
He is the one to teach you the light
Say "no" when they draw the line

You can fight sanctified dogmas
You've got power and are no fool
You're not blind, open your eyes
There is far more to see when you open your mind

He's a rebel, the chosen one
The fight for freedom is his glory
He was banished 'cause he thinks for himself
Rise to victory

Once a lamb, a holy servant
One day he dared to say no
Why should there be only one way?
And everyone put in the same form?

You can fight sanctified dogmas
You've got power and are no fool
You're not blind, open your eyes
There is far more to see when you open your mind

He's a rebel, the chosen one
The fight for freedom is his glory
He was banished 'cause he thinks for himself
Rise to victory
