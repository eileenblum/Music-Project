We march through the darkness, again and again
Facing the evil, no fight is in vain
No rest for the warrior, but anger and pain
Life is a struggle, from birth 'til the end
We all have to pay the price of war
With blood and tears in our hearts
We all have to pay the price of war
With blood and tears in our hearts

This is a song for the fallen ones
Give us the courage to stand and to fight
This is a song for the fallen ones
This is a song for the fallen ones
Give us the courage to stand and to fight
This is a song for the fallen ones

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth you will die

Proudly we march to the battle again
We honor the heroes who died for this land
Our hearts are not sad, we will meet again
Sooner or later, a sword in our hands
We all have to pay the price of war
With blood and tears our hearts
We all have to pay the price of war
With blood and tears in our hearts
