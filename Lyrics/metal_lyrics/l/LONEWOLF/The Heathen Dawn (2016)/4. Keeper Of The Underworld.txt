He's the keeper of the underworld
A dark place without an age
Where we're keeping all our hopes
And where we dream of better days...

And we are bound to its soul
Legions far beyond our control
A secret place where we are free
Where hope reigns instead of fear
He's a keeper, he's a king
A soul healer, land of the free

He's the keeper of the underworld
A dark place without an age
Where we're keeping all our hopes
And where we dream of better days

Time has come to enter the gates
We're fed up by the whole world's lies
A sanctuary to get some rest
To gain new forces and stand to fight
He's a keeper, he's a king
A soul healer, land of the free

He's the keeper of the underworld
A dark place without an age
Where we're keeping all our hopes
And where we dream of better days...

The keeper of the underworld...
