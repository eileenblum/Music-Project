Life's a journey through the dark, a journey without end
Where nothing's fair and nothing's clean, no rules to understand
The strong survives and the weak dies, fools rule on the wise
A spiderweb so dark and cold, you're trapped, eternal fight
Nothing's new under the sun
Unicorns die, empires burn

Bury me, I'll rise again
Kill me, I'll haunt you then
Enslave me, I'll break my chains
I'll be your worst nightmare
Bury me, I'll rise again
Kill me, I'll haunt you then
In a fight he cannot win
A wolf fights until the end

Fire burns, hysteria's on, bloodhounds on the loose
The demon's lies and evil's might it's up to you to choose
If you follow darkened dogmas fascinating men
Or if you stay true to yourself and fight despite all dread
Nothing's new under the sun
Unicorns die, empires burn

Bury me, I'll rise again
Kill me, I'll haunt you then
Enslave me, I'll break my chains
I'll be your worst nightmare
Bury me, I'll rise again
Kill me, I'll haunt you then
In a fight he cannot win
A wolf fights until the end

Until the end...
