The serpent kisses our darkened souls
Licks our wounds and tries to take control
In a soulless world where evil grows so strong
And unicorns lie bleeding on the ground

Out of the dark, into the light
Curse of evil broken by the hands of fate

We fly

Healing my wounds and pain
Leaving the darkness side by side

We fly

My guardian angel
Together we ride the burning skies
I tried to fight and to hold on
But became weaker every day
Today I see the world through new eyes
Together we dream and walk our way
