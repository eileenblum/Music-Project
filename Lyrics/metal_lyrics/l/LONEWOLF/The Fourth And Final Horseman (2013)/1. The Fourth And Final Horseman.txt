When the Jews return to Zion
And a comet rips the sky
And the Roman empire rises
Then you and I must die

The fourth seal is opened
Visions so dark
A pale horse appears
Death on its back

The fourth and final horseman
From the eternal sea he rises
Creating armies on either shores
Turning man against his brother
'til man exists no more

He is the last rider,
The circle is closed
The horsemen are gathered
The end is near
