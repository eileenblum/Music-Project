Lights are out, candles burn
Phantoms dance around us
The trails into fire we follow
Angel in laces, beauty of the dark
Her eyes begging to be fed
The she-wolf's unleashed, now she's gonna eat me alive

Take me for a hellride
Let's go to hell and never come back
Take me for a hellride
Cause I love when the fires burn

Pleasures of sin and the flesh
Valkyrie to damn every saint
She's turning me on, I loose control
Night is ours, beyond the stars
Leaving time far behind
Until it stands still, until we return from the flames
