It's a good day to die, the gods call for me
I'm in peace with myself to end my journey

As I lay on my deathbed sweet voices come to me
Full of pain and sorrow, it's so cold around me
But my heart it feels so warm because you are here
The ones I love say farewell until we meet again

As I lay on my deathbed the reaper comes for me
As I lay on my deathbed I meet my destiny
The reaper comes for me
I meet my destiny

Viktoria I never hold your hand so strong
And you my wife, it's the same, I gave you my last force
Don't cry it's a happy man who leaves far away
Leave without any regrets and this was my final aim

As I lay on my deathbed the reaper comes for me
As I lay on my deathbed I meet my destiny
The reaper comes for me
I meet my destiny

I never cared 'bout fame or gold
I was free as the wind
You gave me your love, you made me stronger
I got all a man can wish for
