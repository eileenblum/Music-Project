Turn off the lights, bury me in the black
Let this day be darkness, with no coming back
Alone in this world, alone with my pain
Searching through the darkness your presence again
Your face hunts my dreams when I close my eyes
The more that I sleep the more my heart dies
The world is so empty, so pale and so cold
I'm left all alone with no one to hold

Another star means another death
Forevermore light up my darkness
Another star means another death
We'll meet again with my last breath

Into obscurity, breathing the night
Searching for an answer, a reason to fight
Too many questions torture my mind
I feel you so near, close by my side
Your face hunts my dreams when I close my eyes
The more that I sleep the more my heart dies
The world is so empty, so pale and so cold
I'm left all alone with no one to hold
