I am the king, the king without a crown
For I am the ruler of every human born
Of all that was, and all that will be
For I am the king of everything to come
Eternally I'll rule the game

Hell is your home and hell's my throne
Where hate and war breed and were born
And I'll slay you one by one
Raising a mighty throne of skulls

And I will rule, rule your little life
You'll never know, this is my might
Hate in men's heart is breeding my force
I'll grind you puppets with no remorse
