I am down on my knees
Red ice as far as I can see
I just want one last victory
To make my ancestors proud of me

One last fight, one last moment of glory

Time for war - and time for glory
The brave lives on eternally
Time for war - and time for victory
Valhalla open your gates for me

I try to stand on my horse again
My axe and sword seem so heavy
I hear the call of the valkyries
The end of the road is close for me

Time for war - and time for glory
The brave lives on eternally
Time for war - and time for victory
Valhalla open your gates for me

This was the tale of an old warrior
Brave on the battlefields, loyal to the gods
True son of Odin, I welcome the death
Hall of the fallen opens for me
