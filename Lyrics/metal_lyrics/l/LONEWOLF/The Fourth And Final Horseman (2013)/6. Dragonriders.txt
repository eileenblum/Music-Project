Winter comes from the sea
Cold winds bring pain and fury
Frost will bite all of you
Like a wolf, without mercy

We arrive, we arrive
We see your shores
We arrive, we arrive
The wolf is at your door

We have followed the northwind
And we're so far from home
Give a name to your wildest fears
Our time has come

We are the dragonriders
The hordes of Thor, the demons of the sea
We are the dragonriders
We hail, we kill, we fight for victory

Say you prayers, we are near
Taste the smell of your fear
We'll nail your god to his cross
With the hammer - the hammer of Thor
