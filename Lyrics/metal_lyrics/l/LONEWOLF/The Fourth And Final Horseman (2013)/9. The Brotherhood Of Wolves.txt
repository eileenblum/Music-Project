A long time ago in the darkness of the woods
Two human brothers were raised by the wolves
One became a wizard, the other a warrior
They were the keepers of the iron words

All across the kingdom their names were known
As the new preachers of the iron religion
They knew how to reach the heart of men
Conquering their souls with the words they said

In your veins runs the blood of a wolf
In your heart lives a warrior's soul
If your spirit is free and brave
Join the pack - the brotherhood of wolves

The dawn of a new age is yet to come
The brothers have awoken the ancient gods
The warrior and the wizard turned the brotherhood
Into a great army, wild and free
