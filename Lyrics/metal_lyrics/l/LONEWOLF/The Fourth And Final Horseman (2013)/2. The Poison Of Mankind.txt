Like a expanding spider web raising a black shadow onto our world
Injecting poison into man's heart
Growing its fears and tearing its soul apart
Born in darkness and evil, hellfire's feast awaits the fallen ones
Fight the demon back to its lair
To get rid of the poison and welcome freedom

Religion means war and pain
Our world goes insane
They want to see their flag up high
They want freedom to die

Back into darkest days, where evil prevails
They're in for the kill

The poison eating the heart of men
The virus that kills their souls
The decease inside the brain of men
The tool making them go insane

The poison - the plague that blackens mankind
The poison - the poison of mankind

And if the day should come
To heed the call to arms
I will defend my country
My freedom and family
