Hunted through the ages
Through the swamp storm and now
We bent but never felt
Today we're stronger than before
Many of us have died
But their spirit our force
You may take our lives
You'll never take our heart and soul

Masquerade of horror
You respect nothing and no one
Misanthropic evil power
Will never slay heathen down
Look in the mirror
And face the murderer's eyes
Now look down your hands
They are soiled with innocent blood

Hail victory hail to freedom
Pagan glory lives on
Hail victory hail to freedom
We are stronger than evil
