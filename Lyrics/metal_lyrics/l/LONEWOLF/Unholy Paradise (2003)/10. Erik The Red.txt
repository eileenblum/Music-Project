Being banished from Iceland
Erick headed far away
Towards west we followed him
And we took this unknown way

On our ships we sailed on
Fighting the storms and the ice
Six months of night northern law
Taming the seas under a darkred sky

Erik the red king of the hills
Erik the red never left his way
Erik the red king of Greenland
Viking heart Erik the red

Hundred Vikings hand in hand
May we lost to aim our quest
One hallowed day we reached land
Greenland was Greenland was ours

On this ground we made our stand
A new mark in history
Viking spirit still lives on
Our tales carried by the wind
