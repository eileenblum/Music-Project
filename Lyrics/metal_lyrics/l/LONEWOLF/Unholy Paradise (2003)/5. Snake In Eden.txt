I am the snake in every Eden
I am the hate that's cast in your heart
I am the lie twisting the truth
I am the light fading to black

Snake in Eden
When the borders become too small
Snake in Eden
I am breaking through the wall

I am the hand which kills thy brother
I am the killer of all innocence
I am evil taming the good
I am in you in him and in her

Snake in Eden
When the borders become too small
Snake in Eden
I am breaking through the wall

Immortal I'll never die
Forever you'll breed my might

Immortal I'll never die
Forever you'll get my might
