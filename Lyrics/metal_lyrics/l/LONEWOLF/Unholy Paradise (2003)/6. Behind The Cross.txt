There are hundred of pyres
Burning through the night
Wizards and witches are hunted
The inquisition strikes

They're taken by storm on the earth
They're put to the wrack they are buried alive

Tears for all the tortured
The slaughtered and the pain
The church left away in her shadow
Tears for all the tortured
The slaughtered and the pain
The church left away in her shadow
Behind the Cross

Surely Jesus was a wise but the church
Perverted his writes
Raping stealing massive killing
The devil in disguise

They're taken by storm on the earth
They're put to the wrack they are buried alive
