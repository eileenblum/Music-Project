Your reign of terror
Shall come to an end
Tonight the oppressed
Are making a stand

Out on the streets
To take your might
Revolution calls now

July; 1789
Not a revolt but a revolution
July; 1789
A call spread through the lad
The people takes command

Bastille's taken by storm
Marquis overuled
Losing all and more
Kings are on the lose

Out on the streets
To take your might
Revolution calls now
Paris is on fire
