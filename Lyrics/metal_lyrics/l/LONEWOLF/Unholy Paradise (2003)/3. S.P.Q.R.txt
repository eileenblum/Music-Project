Eternal fight against the sky
Mighty and proud
Dumb witness of battle cries
A standard always higher
Never will kneel down
We're the one and only law
The mighty ones

One day will defy the gods
The hieracrhy supreme
A realm without boundaries
A standard always higher
Never will kneel down
We're the one and only law
The mighty gods

Empire grows on and on
Empire grows on

Strong and proud we're marching on
Victory is ours
We'll defy the gods
S.P.Q.R
Strong and proud we're marching on
Victory is ours
S.P.Q.R
