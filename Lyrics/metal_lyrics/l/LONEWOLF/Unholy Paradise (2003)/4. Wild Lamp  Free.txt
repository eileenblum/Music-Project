There is a flame and it's burning bright
Deep in our hearts and it can't be tamed
We know well what we want from life
We'll stand the fight together we are strong

Stand tight now

See the fire burns in our eyes
We don't give a damn of what you say
'Cause our heart leads our way
Wild &amp; free

Freedom &amp; love not izorace &amp; hate
The way you guide your moralistic size
It leads to nothing but a golden cell
You burn your wings before you learn to fly

Stand tight now

Lust for life heats in our hearts
Not trendy assholes our rights we claim
We'll never go astray
Wild &amp; free

The lust and flame are forced in iron
We don't give a fuck of the way you see
Metalheads Proud we stand
