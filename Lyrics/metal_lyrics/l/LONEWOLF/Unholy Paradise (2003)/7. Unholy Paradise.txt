Grey cold and dark the sun turns black
On the paradise man once had
The serpents kiss open wounds
Weak blood feeds the evil force

They wait in the dark
To steal your soul and heart
They wait in the dark
To eat your soul and heart

Unholy Paradise
Where the angels came to die

Blood is poisoned fratricide
Religius wars innocence dies
Gaids heart bleed her trial's dar
Greatest beast is born through her sons
