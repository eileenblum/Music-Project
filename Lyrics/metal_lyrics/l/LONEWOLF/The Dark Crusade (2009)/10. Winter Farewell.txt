The snow covers Bavaria
Giving a mystic aura
To the cemetery I enter
Headstones rise through the snow
Like soulkeepers in the fog
Seem to prevail your rest below

Farewell, farewell dear old man
I cannot believe this was the end
I like to believe you're roaming around
Close to her first steps, watching her proud

I don't know if there's god above
But I know you entered the great hall
Having an eye on all our beloved ones
I'm sad she'll never meet you
In her blood is a part of you
The scythe of time felt much too soon
