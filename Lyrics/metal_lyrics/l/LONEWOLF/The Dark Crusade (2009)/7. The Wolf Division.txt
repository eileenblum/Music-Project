We are rooted in the underground - to metal we're bound
We've sworn the oath and honour it's way, the cult of steel we hail
Gift from the gods, precious and pure, a force to guide our rules
We are the masters, we are the slaves following our aim

Slaves of steel
Slaves to metal
Slaves of steel
The wolf division

No mainstream crap but true and raw - the way how should sound metal
The underground breed of legions preaching the iron
We are together, all as one, to defend our gold
No one will ever make us change - fight for the metal reign
