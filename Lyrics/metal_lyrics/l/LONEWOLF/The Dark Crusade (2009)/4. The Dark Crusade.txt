Blackest heart, diabolic souls
Their tongues spit venom and evil
Insane fools spread the blood
of innocence - flowing gore

They want women to be their slaves
And religion to rule the law
A return to middle ages
Where democracy is unknown

The dark crusade - servants of hell
The dark crusade - heirs to the damned

The jihad - we'll fight it back
We're no slaves to religion
Worst liars - manipulation
In fact they spit on the Koran

They want a world where freedom dies
Where religion is policy
A return to darkest days
We left since centuries
