Facing defeat after defeat
Sacred hopes vanished in haze
But with your mother we stood as one
It didn't kill us it made us strong
We walked through hell, but we came back
An iron faith leading our heart
Nothing could destroy this will
And we fought 'til victory

Welcome Vikroria, you are my flesh, you are my blood
Welcome Viktoria, angel of light, you are my pride
Welcome Viktoria, you are my flesh, you are my blood
Welcome Viktoria, angel of light, you changed my life

The hallowed day of your birth
The fight seemed lightyears away
In the moment you saw the light
the darkened spell was slain
Now I feel like a wolf
I'm the guardian of the pack
No one shall do you harm
I'd kill the one who'd mistreat you
