Listen brothers, the war is won
The oppression has been slayed down
We took the sword for a noble cause
Hail and glory to our fallen ones

We've seen their empire fall, we've seen the tyrants crawl
Our freedom was born through our blood, our faith was our force

Hold your banners high
Proud, towards the sky
We hail pagan glory
We hail victory
Hail

Greet the sunrise for it reveals
A new age where man is free
To trust and pray whom he wants
No iron fist to rule the law

There's no god below a cross sealed above wood and stone
He's everywhere and in each believer's heart, no murder tears faith apart
