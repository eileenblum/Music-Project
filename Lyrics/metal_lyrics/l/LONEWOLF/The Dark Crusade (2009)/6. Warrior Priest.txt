Out of the dark, origins not well known
Sacred heart, for the cross we honour
Mighty and great warriors, ready to spill the blood
For the heretic ones have to die, a new age is now to rise

Through the holy fire
By the holy steel
Through the holy trial
The age of the warrior priest

Then we returned into myths of time
Thousand secrets - forever left behind
Our legend still lives on, mixing true and false
About our lives, our gold, our realm and how we died
