The coastal raid on holy island
A new age baptized in blood
The monastery of lindisfarne is in flames
Death came from far, far north
Heathen hearts, viking hordes
Bloodbath in the temple of god, they crushed the cross

Heathen horde
Pagan fire on holy ground

The slaughter of Northumbria
Foretold the viking age
Conquerors with heathen beliefs and faith
Pagan hearts praise values and honour
Spit on the cross and holy evil
The legacy in the hearts of the free today
