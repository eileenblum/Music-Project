Black crows picking up the flesh
From dead bodies lying all around
No descent burial place here
Their mortuary drape is the fog

Flesh is sacred, cannibals roam
The instinct to survive
Caves are the new homes
Technology's far behind

Choirs of the damned echo in the dark
Like Armageddon's lullaby
Souls of black sent a mark
And doomed the world to die
The red button's down,
Now it happened finally
This insane world is laid waste
Destruction is complete
Survivors creep through ruins
Gazing at chaos, complaints and death
Rulers achieved the prophecy
Foretold since thousand of years
No more colors darkness reigns in the sky
The judgement day of a race doomed to die
First came a fireflash
Then ashes obscured the sky
Fires burned the whole cities down
And the ground reveals a no man's land
The hour zero
First came a fireflash
Then ashes obscured the sky
Fires burned the whole cities down
And the ground reveals a no man's land
The hour zero
United clans organize
The post holocaust
To come through the fight
The dawn of mankind

No more colors...

First came a fireflash...

Thousands of years
Now have passed
Unbelievable technology,
Power and glory
Rule the game
Driving some bastard rulers insane

Man will never
Escape his fate
Nuclear war begins again

The order
Screamed with hate:
"Push the red button down - now"

The red button's down
Now it happened again
Another world laid waste
Destruction is complete

The greed for glory
Deep in the heart of men
It was forever and evil will be
Damned is the legacy
