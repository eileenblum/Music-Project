Across the seas a legend is spread
Old seawolves tell
Around empty rum jars
Of an island where the
Dead still walk
One gate to hell
Cursed forevermore
Where all the sinners
Of the seven seas
Live out their curse of blasphemy
Through burning hot haze
Piercing stone cold eyes
Witnessing the curse
Breeding its might
Sent by the church
Brave men sailed on
To face an evil they didnât know
None turned to tell what he saw
They souls may be
Cursed forevermore
Where all the sinnersâ¦.
