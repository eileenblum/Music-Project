Hearing the preacher
Reciting his holy prayer
Hearing my family as they cry in pain
Realizing all too scared to believe
All tough I know Iâm not gone insane
Wide open eyes slowly beating heart
Lethargic state they thought I was dead
Laid me down in a grave nailed up the cover
Put me down in a hole six feet underground
I hear the bell Iâm down in hell
As there a worse fate than to be buried alive
Earth to earth ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Where the last words the preacher said for me
How the grave diggers shovel soil upon my grave
Silence creeps up around me
All seems to fade so far away
Distanced from life living yet dead
Tears pouring down my cheeks
So afraid of my death
Iâm losing my mind
My lungs gasp for air
I hear the bellâ¦
