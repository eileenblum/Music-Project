Lost in a dungeon
Only the dark surrounds
An old mystic cave where sunlight
Never bathed the grounds
Candles are shimmering
Phantoms dance on the walls
Moving slowly over
Instruments of torture
They made you confess
Undone sins under torture
Reign of the wicked
Corruption and terror
How many innocents
Died in this place?
Death the only savior
To escape all pain
What happened between these walls
For the church itâs a shame
This chamber was the gathering
Of raw evil and pure hate
They made you confessâ¦
Holy evil power built by lies
A plague throughout our centuries
Too many people lost their lives
Eaten raw by the priest
