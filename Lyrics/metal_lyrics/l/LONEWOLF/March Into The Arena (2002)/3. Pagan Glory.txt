Centuries ago before Christianity
Raped and stole our legacy
Forgotten mystic ages of mystery
As nature animal and men
Lived in harmony
Through the darkest forest we travel on
Where the snow it never stops to fall
Where the wolves they howl eternally
We keep on singing pagan glory
An alone women
Had knowledge in astrology
Or a wizard knowed of medicine
Christianity soon condemned
As heretics such men
And they destroyed pagan glory
Through the darkest forest we travel on
Where the snow it never stops to fall
Where the wolves they howl eternally
We keep on singing pagan glory
