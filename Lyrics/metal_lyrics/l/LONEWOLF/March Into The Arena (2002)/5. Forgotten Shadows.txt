My dear hear the wolves as
Theyâre howling at the moon
Children of the night sing their mystic songs
Time is right in this desecrated crypt
To explore the keys to immortality
Spiderwebs only embrace
The grey tombstones
As grave covers open every night
Through hot haze and sulphur rising above
Our forsaken mortal life
A sweet and loyal devotion to the night
Itâs lords and powerful ancestral might
Oldest ritualâs since the dawn of time
Weâre all mighty weâll never die
When torches flicker weâre on the hunt
Stalking the blood we hail
My dear dies her mortal life candleâs burnt
Together weâll rise
Welcome princess of hell sleep well
Where the all mighty dwell my love
Tomorrow when youâll be awake
Iâll be at your side
Holding your hand in mine
Forget all mortal cruelty and lies
Freedom is on our side
