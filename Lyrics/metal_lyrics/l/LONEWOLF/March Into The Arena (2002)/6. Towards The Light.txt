Standing here alone in the rain
Time passes and my shadow grows
Iâm left alone all this pain
Forgive me father tomorrow Iâll be gone
To the world where I belong
A world somewhere far beyond
Leaving the darkness for the light
Leaving the ever lost fight
That was my life
The call of freedom
Whispers my name
As I fly towards the shining fight
Shiny razor blade in my hand
The cold steel cuts my veins
Lifeblood flows
I sleep in peaceful sleep
Opening the doors to eternity
To the worldâ¦
