Two centuries ago
In a Hungarian castle
Lived the countess Bathory
Beauty of blackest soul
Ceremonialâs ancient rites
Ritualâs of blood
The search of immortality
To be forever young
Sacrifice blood is life
A young girl is enchained
Lost in the dungeonâs night
Naked the beauty appears
In her fist a dagger shines
Excitement gleaming eyes as the steel
Cuts the young flesh
Bathed in still warm spilling blood
A rebirth through death
Sacrifice blood is life
Screams of pain echo in the halls
Screams of blood down the walls
Bath in warm blood to be immortal
The countess was the queen of evil
