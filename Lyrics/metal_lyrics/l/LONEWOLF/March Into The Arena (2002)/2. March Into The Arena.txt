Now the dawn is to fall on the scenery
Hunted unbelievers are praying in fear
Given to the animals
Cause theyâre going astray
Freedomâs price minority pays
Mothers hold their children
Praying the curtain to fall
March into the arena
Into worldâs circus itâs bloody law
They want to tame the
Flame of freedom
March into the arena
Into worldâs circus itâs bloody law
Hypnotized lambs want to see your fall
Is there really so much that
Has changed our days?
The ruler is stalking those in his way
The public opinion has
The thumbs turned down
Grand together fight for your own
Boiling the arena explodes
Men turn into animals
March into the arenaâ¦
They want to tame our flame
But we are strong together
