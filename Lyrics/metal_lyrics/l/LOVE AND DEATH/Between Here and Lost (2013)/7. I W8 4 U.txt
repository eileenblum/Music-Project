[feat. Mattie Montgomery of For Today]Make you real and honest
Make it worth it all
Make the pain melt away

WAIT
Donât throw away another day
WAIT
Take a new avenue
WAIT
Look inside you will find
WAIT
The way you lie

Tell me you lost it
Tell me you lost it
Whatever it takes you know I wonât let it break you
Tell me you lost it
Tell me you lost it
Donât carry the weight
I wait

I wait for you
Always will, always do
I wait for you
Hurting, bleeding, dying, but
I wait for you
Always will, always do
I wait for you
Hurting, bleeding, dying, but
I wait

Make you feel so vibrant
Make you fall in love
Make you feel like brand new

WAIT
Donât throw away another day
WAIT
Take a new avenue
WAIT
Look inside you will find
WAIT
The way you lie

Tell me you lost it
Tell me you lost it
Whatever it takes you know I wonât let it break you
Tell me you lost it
Tell me you lost it
Donât carry the weight
I wait

I wait for you
Always will, always do
I wait for you
Hurting, bleeding, dying, but
I wait for you
Always will, always do
I wait for you
Hurting, bleeding, dying, but
I wait

Iâm fed up of missing you
Iâm fed up of all your lies
Iâm fed up of chasing you
Iâm fed up of your disguise
Iâm fed up of missing you
I
