My life
Your death
Iâve been contemplating
And I let you go
As you disappeared
I didnât see it standing there
I didnât see it fall apart
And everything was so unfair
I had to walk away
To get it right

And by the way
Iâm doing alright and you donât know
What I had to give to walk away and live again
Iâll always miss you and
And by the way
I think about you and the memories
Are never gonna leave
I know Iâll see you there with me
Where we will always be alive

Youâre gone
Iâm here
Itâs completely unfair
And my gifts
Your scars
I will carry now

Did you see me standing strong
Dying with a broken heart
From you fatality
So whyâd you have to go
Why did you go

And by the way
Iâm doing alright and you donât know
What I had to give to walk away and live again
Iâll always miss you and
And by the way
I think about you and the memories
Are never gonna leave
I know Iâll see you there with me
Where we will always be alive

I donât know how to go on
I hate you didnât make it
Iâm so devastated
I donât know how to go on
Iâm holding onto memories
Dying in my misery
I donât know how to go on
Iâve never felt pain like this
I donât know how to go on
Tell me how to go on

And by the way
Iâm doing alright and you donât know
What I had to give to walk away and live again
Iâll always miss you and
And by the way
I think about you and the memories
Are never gonna leave
I know Iâll see you there with me
Where we will always be alive
