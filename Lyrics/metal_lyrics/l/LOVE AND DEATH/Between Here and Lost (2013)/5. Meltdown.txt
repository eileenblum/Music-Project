I think Iâm having a meltdown

I feel the tension
(I feel the tension)
Confessions told
(Tell me, tell me everything)
Insanity is taking over
The fantasies are driving me mad

Before
Never let go
Before I fold
Before
Never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
Iâm suffocating, donât leave me here waiting

The cry within
(Cry within)
The flesh is bold
(Tell me, tell me everything)
Calamity is waiting silent
The razor is cutting the pain and letting it out

Before
Never let go
Before I fold
Before
Never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
Iâm suffocating, donât leave me here waiting

Over and over in my head
I see your scars
Remember the day when we first met
Take me back

Before
Never let go
Before I fold
Before
Never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
Iâm suffocating, donât leave me here waiting

Meltdown
For a meltdown
Meltdown
