Hearing voices in your head
Hurting bruises spoken through their mouths again
Every letter breaks the skin
One by one the bruises find their way back in
They bleed you dry
They bleed you dry

Show us how to live
How do we forgive
Through the bitterness
How do we get there
Show us how to die
How to give our lives
Living sacrifice
How do we get there

Many scars we try to hide
How much longer will we keep the pain alive
They bleed you dry
They bleed you dry

Show us how to live
How do we forgive
Through the bitterness
How do we get there
Show us how to die
How to give our lives
Living sacrifice
How do we get there

Now that I gave you all of my heart
Why do they rip it apart
Shattered and broken down again
Fix the pieces
The pieces

Show us how to live
How do we forgive
Through the bitterness
How do we get there
Show us how to die
How to give our lives
Living sacrifice
How do we get there

Show us how to live
Show us how to die
How do we get there
Show us how to give
How to give our lives
How do we get there
