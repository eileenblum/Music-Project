Wake up sleepy Wide AWAKE!

I... Am... The walking dead.
I am death's best friend.
I create disaster.
I'm the master killing me.
There's no Innocence,
There's only pain
Iâm empty!

Master, Master save me.
Master, Master kill me.
Don't give up on me now.
Cause that's what I've already done.
My body's breaking down.
I feel my mind getting numb.

Why... Do... I hurt myself?
Why can't I escape this hell?
I am always blaming,
Always chasing broken dreams.
I keep screaming out,
But no one ever Hears Me!

Master, Master save me.
Master, Master kill me.
Don't give up on me now.
Cause that's what I've already done.
My body's breaking down.
I feel my mind getting numb.

Bleeding from my disconnection.
Lost inside myself.
Forsaken by my own reflection.
Abandoning myself.

I'M WIDE AWAKE!
On myself...
I'M WIDE AWAKE!
Give up, give up...
On myself...
Give up, give up
I'M WIDE AWAKE!
SAVE ME!

Master, Master save me.
Master, Master kill me.
Don't give up on me now.
Cause that's what I've already done.
My body's breaking down.
I feel my mind getting numb.

Bleeding from my disconnection.
Lost inside myself.
Forsaken by my own reflection.
Abandoning myself.

NO!

I'M WIDE AWAKE!
