[Expanded Edition Bonus Track]I hear the words you say
With your twisted tongue
Careless venom

I live caught in your web
Thereâs a tug on the line
And you eat me alive

Tell me how youâre better than I
Why are you so empty inside?
Youâll never ruin me!!

Use me as your own deviceâ¦
You beat me downâ¦
With your judgmentsâ¦

And I bought what you soldâ¦
It cost everythingâ¦
And itâs left meâ¦ aloneâ¦

Tell me how youâre better than Iâ¦
Not better! Not better!, NO!
Why are you so empty inside?

You havenât got a clue!
Iâve wiped my hands of you!
Tell me how youâre better than Iâ¦
Youâll never ruin me!!

You look so innocent
Youâre screaming, Iâm not listening
YOUâLL NEVER RUIN!
Youâll never ruin me!!

I FEEL!
SO MUCH!
TORTURE!
FROM YOUR WORDS!

I FEEL!
SO MUCH!
TORTURE!
FROM YOUR WORDS!

Remove the stain of your curse
The trace of your smell is decaying
Discard the weight of the guilt
Youâll find no remorse
Youâll be left hollow

Tell me how youâre better than I
NOT BETTER! NOT BETTER!, NO!
Why are you so empty inside?

You havenât got a clue!
Iâve wiped my hands of you!
Tell me how youâre better than I
Youâll never ruin me!!

I FEEL!
SO MUCH!
TORTURE!
FROM YOUR WORDS!
