You say itâs criminal
(Itâs not criminal)
I say itâs logical
(Itâs logical)
I said my last no thank you
Where do we go from here
We trust the same lies
Trust the same things
Justify the crime
Whatâs it for
What is it for

Watching the bottom fall
(The bottom fall)
Watching you burn it all
On and on, on and on
Will we learn again
And will it hurt forever
Watching the bottom fall
Fall!

You say Iâm cynical
(You say, I say)
Youâre hypocritical
(I say)
I said my last no thank  you
I thought I made it clear
We trust the same lies
Trust the same things
Justify the crime
Whatâs it for
What is it for

Watching the bottom fall
(The bottom fall)
Watching you burn it all
On and on, on and on
Will we learn again
And will it hurt forever
Watching the bottom fall

I donât have energy for you
I donât have energy to see this through
I donât have energy for you
I donât have energy can we be through

Iâm through â with you

Iâm through â with you
Iâm through â with you
Iâm through â with you
With you
Through, with you

Watching the bottom fall
(The bottom fall)
Watching you burn it all
On and on, on and on
Will we learn again
And will it hurt forever
Watching the bottom fall

Fall!
