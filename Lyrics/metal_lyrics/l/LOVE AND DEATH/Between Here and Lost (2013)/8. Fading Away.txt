Contamination feeding the masses
Procrastination killing us all

We can see it decay and we play with it
Will we ever know
That weâre livinâ a lie
We can say itâs ok and keep fakinâ it
Will we ever know

Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
Time, time is so cold
We all die one day
Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
We wonât be around

This masquerade is falling to pieces
This escapade is coming apart

We can see it decay and we play with it
Will we ever know
That weâre livinâ a lie
We can say itâs ok and keep fakinâ it
Will we ever know

Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
Time, time is so cold
We all die one day
Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
We wonât be around

Lie down and let GO!
Lie down! Let go!
Lie down! Let go!

Our pictures are so clear
Weâre fading away

Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
Time, time is so cold
We all die one day
Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
We wonât be around

Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
Time, time is so cold
We all die one day
Lie down and let go
Weâre fading away
We wonât be around
