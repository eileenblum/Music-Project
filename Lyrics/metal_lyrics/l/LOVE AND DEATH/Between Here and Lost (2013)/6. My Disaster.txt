How can you watch me suffer
How does it feel
Why do you stay so silent
Will the time reveal

Youâre the leader I follow
Am I a victim of circumstance

Feeling everything
Crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid
Itâs my Disaster
Losing everything
Giving all of me
I feel so betrayed
In my Disaster

How can you say you love me?
Itâs so unclear
I hope the pain will leave one day
With all the fear

Youâre the leader I follow
Am I a victim of circumstance

Feeling everything
Crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid
Itâs my Disaster
Losing everything
Giving all of me
I feel so betrayed
In my Disaster

But Iâll make it through
But Iâll make it through

Iâve got to dominate
I will not tolerate it
Will I appreciate
The pain that leads me to you

Feeling everything
Crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid
Itâs my Disaster
Losing everything
Giving all of me
I feel so betrayed
In my Disaster

But Iâll make it through
My Disaster
But Iâll make it through
My Disaster
