Promises that I made you should ignore
The future that I painted I can't afford
I know that it seems that I left you no choice
I fell down on my knees and I begged your forgiveness

[Pre-chorus:]
Consequences of a lie
Failed redemption though I tried
Maybe someday I'll get it right

[Chorus:]
So I'm sorry to say (I didn't want it all)
Sorry to wake you (I didn't need it all)
I never wanted it to hurt

This animal instinct rots me to the core
These impulses raging I can't stop no more
I worry that you just don't love me the same
I fell down on my knees and I begged your forgiveness

[Pre-chorus:]
Consequences of a lie
Failed redemption though I tried
Maybe someday I'll get it right

[Chorus:]
So I'm sorry to say (I didn't want it all)
Sorry to wake you (I didn't need it all)
I never wanted it to hurt
I never wanted it

I'mâ¦ lost
I'mâ¦ lost

Sorry to say, sorry to say
Sorry to falsify myself every way
Sorry to say, sorry to say
Sorry to falsify myself everyday

Falsify
Falsify
Falsify

[Chorus:]
So I'm sorry to say (I didn't want it all)
Sorry to wake you (I didn't need it all)
I never wanted it to hurt
I never wanted it

Falsify
Falsify
