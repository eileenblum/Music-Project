[HestnÃ¦s / Knutsen / Moe / SjursÃ¸]

Found no peace in all their lies
So I began my journey
Since Iâve wandered far and wide
Oh the heart in me is yearning
If you are darkness, I am your shadow
All the fates that Iâve beheld
Marked by sceneries of treason
May it all one day be mine
Through all mortalsâ pain Iâm feeding
If you are darkness, I am your shadow
Show me the rivers of sadness
And Iâll go down to the valley below
Show me the visions of sorrow
And Iâll know where to seek my goal
Let your pain flow through me
Stir up the demons that tore me
Through the fields of burning flesh
I met my destiny in glory
