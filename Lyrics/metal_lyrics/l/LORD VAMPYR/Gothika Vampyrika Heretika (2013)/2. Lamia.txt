The desolate and cold air around me
I walk through the fog in this cemetery
I feel eyes watching me
I feel presences that touch me

Slow vague among the graves
In search her face in the pictures
She is always in my thoughts
Sweet and sad

Lamia
dark desire
Lamia
ice and fire

Dried flowers on your grave
And 'as long as no one comes to see you
I look at your sweet eyes in the picture
I wish you were here with me

I kneel down and cry
I would like you come back to me
I caress the stone
I hear noises in the coffin

Lamia
dark desire
Lamia
ice and fire

I move the tombstone
I feel her nails scratching
Open your coffin
Her eyes look at me

Her mouth is open
A bite on my neck
And now... the oblivion
