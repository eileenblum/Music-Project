I sleep... I don't wake
In this old house
Too many sinister noise
I turn around in bed
I feel a strange cold

A sad chant away
A stone carillon
I hear her voice
She calls me

I was a night of fifteen years ago
The girl was playing in her room and calm
Suddenly she heard noises
She came down the stairs

He saw his mother on the ground
The face full of blood
Cuts on her chest and legs

The little dead girl
The little dead girl
Is waiting for me!
She calls me

Close by his father without heads
Sitting on the chair
A man stared at her with eyes of evil

He climbed the stairs with knife in his hand
They run up inside his room
She was locked in desperate

He broke down the door
Did not help her tears
He took her by the hair
And slashed the throat

You want to be free
She shows me where lives her murderess
I know that's a madness
But I'll kill for her

Now she is free, her soul is free
