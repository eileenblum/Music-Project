Every night I think it's the last
Hear those whispers that does not leave you alone
Feel their hands caress in bed
It's time to open your eyes

You don't want to see what's around you
Do you want to fall asleep and wake up with the sun
Or it's already day
But your must resist

In the Kingdom of Fear
Don't believe it... but all is real
In the Kingdom of Fear

Hold strong your cross
but you will not need
Pray your god that will not help you
You can't do anything against the darkness

Cry if you want, get on your knees
Hear them whisper your name
and that will be the time
to embrace the dark

In the Kingdom of Fear
Don't believe it... but all is real
In the Kingdom of Fear

The black thing is now in and out of you
In your brain like a plant that makes the roots
Now you are evil... now you have no fear!
