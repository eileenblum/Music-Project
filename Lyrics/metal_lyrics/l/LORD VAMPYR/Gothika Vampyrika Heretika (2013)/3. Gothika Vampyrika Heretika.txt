All souls damned here
Burning in lust
Burning in the burning flames of desire
Damned forever and ever

Here everything begins and ends
The blood you shed
The blood you've tasted
Now with you and within you

Gothika Vampyrika Heretika

You have denied your god
You have renounced your family
You've chosen darkness
And now the darkness is within you

Here everything begins and ends
The blood you shed
The blood of innocent children
Now with you and within

Seven deadly sins
They are inside of you
Deny all your gods
This is the end
