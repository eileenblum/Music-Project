I feel a presence behind me
But it's just imagination
I turn and I see no one
Then suddenly I hear a noise

I see a beautiful woman coming down the stairs in front of me
She wears a red dress and wearing a black cloak on his shoulders

Coming at me
I look with deep eyes and ice
Her lips are red like wine
She comes over and hands me a hand

I feel kidnapped
I have a strange feeling
Something cold and malignant
She leads me upstairs
In her room

Drops the black cloak
Then she takes off her clothes
I'm staying with sin
The perfect body, white as snow

She invites me to approach
I'm excited and scared but I go to her
She kisses me, hugs me as if
I can not resist

I am sitting on her bed
She bites me, I feel my warm blood flowing
I feel her teeth sinking ever more voracious

Maybe I'm the last moments of my life
But that's all I want
