Wolves are my guide
On this night of full moon and storm
I walk the dark paths of this sinister place
I hear voices around me
I see the castle in the distance
Great medieval towers rise
Some dim light inside
The wind through my face

A few more steps and I'll know what to expect
What is hidden in this ancient castle?
The old lady of the inn warned me
She told me to be careful,
said that there is evil in there

I hurt my face and arms through this dark forest
They seem to want me to hold
They seem to say "Don't go!"
But curiosity is stronger than fear

Now I see before me the great gate
Heads of demons embedded in the wood
I don't have time to knock the door open

Inside is a strange glow almost red...
Candles lit everywhere
But I feel cold
I can't tell if the cold is inside or outside of me
