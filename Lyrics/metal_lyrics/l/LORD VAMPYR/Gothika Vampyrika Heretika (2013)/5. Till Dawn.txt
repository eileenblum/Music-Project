I want to taste your blood slowly
Let it flow into me
In my veins
Capture your thoughts and make them mine

A feeling of pleasure and lust
Invade my senses... invade my senses
Lick the drops of blood... from your neck
You'll be mine tonight, forever and ever

We will stay together until dawn... until dawn
We will be a single thing until dawn... until dawn
I'll hold you in my arms
You will fall before my eyes
Impure and evil
Sweet and bitter as death

Now... you're mine, you are mine
Every night you'll be mine
Any thoughts will be mine!

You are my source of blood
Every time I drink from your white neck
Every drop of your blood is mine... only mine

You are mine
Every night
You are mine
