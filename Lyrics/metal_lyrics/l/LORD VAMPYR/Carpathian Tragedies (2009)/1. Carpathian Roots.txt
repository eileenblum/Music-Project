It pulses, it breaths, it moves...
It watches at you and searches for you...
It whispers at your ears... And makes you dream...
And you can hear itâs heart-beat...
Itâs alive!

Iâm the root... The root of Carpathia
Iâm the root... The root of Madness
Iâm the ink to write your Necronomicon
I'm the prayer... to enslave your demons
Iâm the blood that makes you free
Iâm the root... the root... the root...

It tells, it speaks, it rises the damnation
Listen to itâs stories:
They can be short of neverending,
Always new and always old,
Always the same and always different
Close your eyes, close your mouth...
Also in silence and in blindness you will find it in you
Itâs in you...itâs in you... itâs in you...

And so, in itâs many forms and groups such as prose and poetry
Story or comments,
We are devoted to it...
To the pleasure of the sound it produces
To itâs existance that describes a moment
What beats, breathes, moves, we watch...

Iâm the root... The root of Carpathia
Iâm the root... The root of Madness
Iâm the ink to write your Necronomicon
I'm the prayer... to enslave your demons
Iâm the blood that makes you free
Iâm the root... the root... the root...
