The sun subsides, burning before my eyes
They're bleeding
Give way for night undying
The flames of hope expire
No vision can replace what I feel
This weight of darkness under which you must kneel
So lost!
The night, mother of mercy,
Protect us all from luminosity
The light in which we all burn!
It shines too bright,
The blinding searing lies!
The black one, shield us from this torture
Black one, protect us from these liars
shade us from luminous pretense
Their white facade on innocence
No image will restore who I was
No locked in sickness in everlasting shock
So lost!
