It's the dark construction of the heart
To seek the things which can be given
To want to un-acquired, the unachievable
It's our need, our ravenous hunger
The deadly wait inside, what makes us covet
To want the un-acquired, the unachievable, 
our desire for destruction
And how we love it 
And how we covet
This endless low desire
And how we covet
We know it's nature yet don't repress it
We feel the hatred but cant detest it
How slim the chance to conquer and control
Yet we still seek to dominate some destiny 
a violent dance of death with narcissus
Our destroyer, the downfall of man
And how we love it 
And how we covet
This endless low desire
And how we covet!
Let me
Let me have it all!
Let me have my downfall!
