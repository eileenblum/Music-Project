No intent to stop listening
But the screams were too deafening
My flame of faith abates flickering
A dead mass of doom inside
They keep marching with thundering steps
Triumphant postures
Blank faces of death
Without hope to keep them occupied
Diversion fails me every time
I'm in a hopeless place right now
My efforts doomed to failure
They're still marching
Keep thundering ahead
Victorious attitudes
Blank faces of death
I as infernal
Unholy internal!
I as infernal!
Forever doomed
Exhale - It's like they stand in wait
Inhale - another step of faith
No doubt they would all bleed in unison to keep it red
They keep marching with thundering steps
Triumphant postures
Blank faces of death
