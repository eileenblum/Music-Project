Say goodbye to all your treasured things
Prepare to greet the suffering
To the fore a clash between divergent
And so the battle begins
Crush them down, erase their creed
World of pain, let them bleed
All of them fail to see,
eyes gone blind in deceit
Shallow are the values of a defect class
Senseless
Fighting for a heartless and degraded cause
Demons of the world gather up their arms
Hallowed be the morals of the perfect class
Splendid!
Fighting for compassion and a virtuous cause,
How perfectly to ravage the earth
Eyes gone blind
Dankness calls
Unending night!
