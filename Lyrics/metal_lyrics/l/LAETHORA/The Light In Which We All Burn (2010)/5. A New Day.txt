When you prepare and plan for so much worse
When you anticipate nothing but another curse
It's just a new day, just a new day 
just a fucking new day!
Our curse and damnation
Our curse and desperation, a new awakening!
When words and phrases hold no meaning
And the deaf and dumb arouse no feelings
It's just a new day, just a new day 
just a fucking new day!
When the screaming bombs keep falling
And you couldn't if you tried to care less
It's just a new day, just a new day 
When nothingness outshines the darkness
And emptiness outweighs your energy
It's just a new day, just a new day 
When you prepare and plan for so much worse
When you anticipate nothing but another curse
It's just a new day, just a new day 
just a fucking new day!
