All hail the latest new world order!
Monetary distribution, spot on disorder
A desolate view of outright disaster
The slaughter of man will now go faster
Cast to ruin, 
reduce to trash whatever prospects we once had
Religious swine
You spread the word of faith divine onto the world
And strait upright without a doubt, in lack of gen
Never short of ruin
The sweetest taste of death on tongue,
Persistent hate to fill your lungs
Exploitative reign of power,
A poisonous mass of influence
Cursed be you all!
All hail the new world order!
All hail the new disorder!
Where everything is cast to ruin, 
reduce to trash whatever prospects we once had
Ideals are buried on plain demand
The central creed, to take what's at hand
