From the deepest core of self
From my internal slumber
From the place where all seems futile
And defiance no longer screams
I have awoken
It calls me
My uproar!
It fills me 
To rid all
My uproar!
My uproar!
In me new found strength
Born from hate and corruption
My uproar!
No second guessing
No contemplating right or wrong
It's just a fact, this rage is pure!
The suffering, the misery
The sickening dishonesty
The conjuring, the agony
Blessed by my war
