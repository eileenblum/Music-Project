We walk this earth and how we preach
Still we have nothing sane to teach
Man is only sick as his lies
And we are in deed an incurable disease
I cast your damnable doctrine out
For faith will never bring proof
It will never carry the weight of truth
Or make sense of our existence
What we know as the human pest
Will never cease to accept as true
The very fallacies on which we build our deceitful creations
