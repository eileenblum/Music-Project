So hear the lies, in consensus, It's our final sacrifice
Come drown us one by one, I'm willing to let go
Undertow from below, sucking harder the deeper we go
The lies repeated in a vortex of demise
Take us down, deep to drown
Bathing in our sins, our final baptism
Come cleanse this world from filth,
I'm willing to let go
In too deep, cannot breathe,
Pulling harder from beneath
It'll soon be over now, come rid this world disease
World deluge
Flood the earth, raise the waters high
Rid the filth, cleanse us out!
Flood the world! Suffocating lies
Washed away by the oceans now
Take us down deep to drown!
Rid the filth, cleanse us out!
