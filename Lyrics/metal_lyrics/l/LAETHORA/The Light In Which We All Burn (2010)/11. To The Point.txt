Lost for words but never action
No point in anything you represent
No point in anything you signify
So what's the point of striving to defy?
Lost for words but never battle
Sick to death of all your problems
Sick to death of your mistakes
A damn distaste for all your flaws
So, there is it!
Confess or meet demise
Fight for every wretched thing you hold dear
Now, fight for your lies
Just fight
'Cause I'm in for the kill
To the point!
You worthless shit!
To the point!
To the point!
