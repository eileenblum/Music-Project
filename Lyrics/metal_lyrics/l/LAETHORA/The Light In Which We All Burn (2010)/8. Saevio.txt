Violence breeds violence
Give me the benefit and I'll prove it to you
For every lie you've ever told
For every follower gone cold
I'll make you suffer a thousand fold
It is the stench of what you do
and how you cover up the truth
Behind your fallacies of confidence,
those smirks betraying you
Violence breeds violence
Let us direct you to the bastards who bought it
Violence breeds violence
Let us direct you to the bastards who bought it
For every lie you've ever told
I'll make you suffer a thousand fold
I wish that all your fucking evil in this vile and rotting world
Slowly backfires and never stops haunting you
