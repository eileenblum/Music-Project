[performed by Lyrinx]Where is our control of the universe?
Not understanding our role in the universal equilibrium.
Ignorance is excuse.
No future.
Only nature's selection.
How can a future be expected?
Years of limiting work crushes the will to understand.
Slowly limiting our possibilities.
