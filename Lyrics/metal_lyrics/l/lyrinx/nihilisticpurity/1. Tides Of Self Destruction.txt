Standing on the edge
I have come far
Cold and warn down
I must turn back (and follow another path)
Before it is too late
Against my own will I am forced to go back
It's colder, in fear
Hypothermia, is this the end?
My arms are dead weights
My thoughts jaded
Did I plan for this?
As the tide of self destruction sets in
The cycle is complete
