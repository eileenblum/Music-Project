Without choice, we are
Ripped into a world of boundaries
Form, love, death shape us
Instead of realising our potential

This is the only way
Can you feel the burden?
There is no other way
Can you sense the ending now?

This is the only way
Can you feel the burden?
There is no other way

Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
