Anti existence, anti consciousness
Where black meets white and yet is not visible
Anti culture
Anti equilibrium

Choking without oxygen, life has always been so fragile
These wasted moments building faceless structures
Empires fall, memories fade

Are you living?
Are you free?

You never had control, you never will
You are weak in every imaginable way

I was never asked if this was for me
I reject unwritten philosophy
Words are bondage, a slave to thought
With words come control, a slave to the end

Am I isolated?
Am I mad?
Do I even care?
