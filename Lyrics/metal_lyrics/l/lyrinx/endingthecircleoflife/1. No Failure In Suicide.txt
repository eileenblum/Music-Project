The final conclusion
Today's tomorrow and will never change
I should be sorry for today's loss
But I care not
Physical surroundings an illusion
I am bored of this existence
There is nothing left to achieve
Deconstructing this life has given me a purpose
To end the circle of life
Do not confuse this for weakness
My choice is to contribute nothing to society
I will be lost to ever changing history

I do however wish I knew the answer to one question
Why is humanity so content with monotony?
So this is goodbye
The end of an era
I never really existed anyway
There is no failure in suicide
