Anguish inside is rising
feel the presence of the other sid
I'm your incarnated confusion
the mind that don't need any solution

So I look into the deepest of me
can you see what I once was?
this is what I have become
An insanity to your mind's fear

Dark is the path there I'll be by your side
don't try to run, you cannot hide
You screamed and cried as I revealed you my way
the way that's gonna repay you my pain
