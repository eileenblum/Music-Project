I walk lightly over the earth I see
I still keep trying to feel
nothing is left, time to die out again
once you were here but now your gone my friend
nothing is like I once saw the horizon
so lonely and so cold
so lonely and so alone

I absorb what I'll no longer know
this is not what I expected to feel
the time has taken my life away
what I love has been ripped away from me

Ages have past since you coloured my light
I'll never again see shining eyes so bright
forever and ever I'll be a forgotten name in your mind
without you my dear is my existence not worth calling life

Nothing can be as it was my friend
everything withers and grows up again
forever you're gone my friend

here all alone to the unknown send
