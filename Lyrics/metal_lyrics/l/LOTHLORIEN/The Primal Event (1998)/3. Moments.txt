Come down to me
I'll give you all you need to live
I'll let go, give in, feel free
I don't need to live

Come down to me
stand for the things you belive in
my heart is burning
all doors wide open
I'll let go, give in, feel free
I don't need to live

I just want to leave it all behind
pay attention
emotions no longer bear mankind

Misfortune grows by every moments fall
the irony of my yearning passion
emotions swirl round my coming event

that stops the heartpounding rhythm
