Take a look at the confrontation
view of the final destination
take my life to the bottom line
set my heart for detonation
find the way to imagination
travel through the soulway station
karma the meditation

Take me down to the peaceful ground
that peaceful ground I never found
look at th etime that spins by me now
the ticking, taking time with a closer sound

Put out my life
step out of my eyes, step out of my sight
all splendid lies
takes larger size by brand new disguise
put out my life
step out of my eyes, step out of my sight
no rest is mine, no peace in mind
cause I wear mankind
