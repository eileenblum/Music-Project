Foolish eyes watch me now
the steel comes in like thunder
with deep wounds I down bow
time to go without questions, without wonder
my trembling body turns silent, turns cold
time to join the land down under

when drizzle turns to rain
when tears from a crying eye slowly turn to oceans
when living is in vain
when bleeding hears comes out in words and emotions

Utopian feelings for a stronger imagination

Supernatural mind and soul
the deal gives me anger
the silent wheel starts to roll
human race another failure
watch out for the misfit factors wherever you go
protect your mind, body and soul

Sleepers used for the higher powers
failing against supernatural man
lurking slowly, heavens towers
life runs out in the sand
