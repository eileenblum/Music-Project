I feel the call, the eternity I can't prevail
by ages of distress and a life so enslaved
memories from my past crawling closer
can this lonely night come forth again?

I hide myself surrounded by shadows
I'm alone within darkness with deep tearful eyes
I feel so afraid, cold and alone
but she's within my heart, mind and soul

Nothing seems to be worth living for
my end so near and so real
my nocturnal desire must final stand
I can't live through them once again

With no strength left I force myself through the rain
I can't feel my future, only my mind's pain
towards my end I'm crawling
just thinking of her with deep mourning eyes
please forgive my beloved
I must end my life and leave you crying behind
