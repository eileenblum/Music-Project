They promise freedom but they themselves
Are slaves of corruption
With their mouths they praise God
They preach the name of Jesus and his love
Some want to pervert the gospel of Christ
Changing the word of God for their convenience

They are wells without water
Lies and blasphemies

These sects are born in such a manner
That they draw man away from the truth

They ask money for healing, prosperity
Prostitution of the gospel
They listen to seducting spirits
And doctrines of demons
They preach false doctrines

Disguising themselves as Christians but they are
False prophets that introduce destructive heresy

Talking like brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed
And shall utterly perish in their own corruption
For it would have been better for them not to have known Jesus

They are like a dog returning to his own vomit again

Now the time has come to discern the schemes
Of the devil because Jesus is the only way
And salvation is free
