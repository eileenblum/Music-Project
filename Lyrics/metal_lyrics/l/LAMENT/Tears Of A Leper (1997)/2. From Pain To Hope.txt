Sadness and pain cover the people
They cry out for freedom
Escaping from death
Looking for answers
Broken dreams, wounded hearts

They walk in agony
They are hated
For the color of their skin
Fear in their minds

Death will come soon
And sickness in their bodies
They live in our world
And want an answer
A hope to be free

They are poor and no one
Will help, from pain to hope
Jesus Christ is the way
He died for everyone
Your race doesn't matter

The people don't care
If they die or cease to exist
The future is the same without hope
Or love
