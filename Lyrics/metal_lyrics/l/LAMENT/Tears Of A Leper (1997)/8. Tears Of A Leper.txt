He was lost in the wilderness
Finding no way to a place he could stay
He was hungry and thirsty
And his soul failed him, he sat in darkness
And in the deepest gloom

Living in agony and depression
Through his tears he cried out
I prefer strangling and death
Rather than this body of mine, it's not enough to be just
I deserve to die for the sin in my life

Porque no hay lugar donde se escondan
Los que hacen maldad

Por haberte desobedecido, mi Dios
Estoy perdido en Ã©ste mundo de pecado
He caÃ­do y me estoy muriendo
PerdÃ³name, SeÃ±or
AyÃºdame porque yo solo no puedo
Quiero estar contigo otra vez

Have mercy on me my Jesus
Look upon my affliction and suffering
You lift me up from the doors of death
I remember the good times we had together Lord
But now I am bound by ties of death
And torments of perversity
