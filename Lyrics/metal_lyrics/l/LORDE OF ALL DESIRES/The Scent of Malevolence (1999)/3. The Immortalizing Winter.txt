Under a veiled and lucid moon 
bearing shades of crimson 
Oceans of blood wane through it 
It casts creeping shadows 
upon the frost ridden earth 
Amongst the worms 
I arise from my sepulcher 
dreams of blood and flame elude me 
Again, the visions that came 
show light vanquished 
from the planes which I walk 
A maze is woven of dire despair 
and suffocating sorrow 
innocent death, unable to satiate 
desire to relinquish every impurity 
from my being 
I writhe in anticipation 
Once numb to an undying 
hunger with great haste 
hatred of divinity grew unbearable 
now for I am numb no longer 
Death, the immortalizing winter, flew 
Long ago, this wraith dwelled inside me 
defiled by deceiving words that 
enslave you to him 
Soon to put to sleep 
my blackened spirit thirsts for thee 
Unleashing anger to transform 
my pain into pleasure 
Frozen eyes, no longer 
shed sullen tears 
an emptiness growing with every 
dream of darkly paradise 
churning clouds pour incessant 
storms over these barren lands 
desire overcomes me... 
I invoke the darkness 
From invocation came sin 
where remorse was none 
a hell which pure spirits 
should not dwell
