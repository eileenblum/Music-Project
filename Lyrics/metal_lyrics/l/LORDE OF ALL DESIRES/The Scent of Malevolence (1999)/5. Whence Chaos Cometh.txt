Since man's first disobedience 
Immense enmity for him ensued 
Shameful of erroneous sin 
enslaved by benighted words 
Trials seeking to overturn refuted 
seemed immortally unpierceable 
Relentlessly praised, never defied 
Endless repulsion made sentient 
supplanting his creation 
Whence chaos cometh 
Debel all light, come forth Abaddon 
Instill pestilence among the spiritless 
Devoid of facile bliss 
Lifeless, gone the way of all flesh 
Slowly powers build, reinforced 
by those persuaded souls 
The time now upon us 
of prophecies foretold 
Chaos has erupted 
as the noose begins to tighten 
Close at hand, the hour of death 
for all those who oppose his reign 
Suffering, inverted now 
is the cross that misled you 
Diablerie has risen to power and 
now shall consume the earth 
Slowly you see as the streets 
fill with blood 
The fiery sky paints 
the pictures of pain 
Terror, bereaved you become as 
your fear doth consume you alive 
Whence chaos cometh 
Debel all light, come forth Abaddon 
Instill pestilence among the spiritless 
Devoid of facile bliss 
Lifeless, gone the way of all flesh
