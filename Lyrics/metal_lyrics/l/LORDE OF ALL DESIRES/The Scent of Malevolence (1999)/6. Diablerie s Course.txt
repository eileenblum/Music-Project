You stand frozen and scream out 
in terror as the earth 
thunders and quakes 
You are part of those forgotten souls 
left to suffer and wither away 
Now I watch as your fear overcomes you 
my mouth is still fresh with your taste 
Entombed in your personal hell 
through your pain I receive my thrill 
Enchanted by the beauty of death 
we'll celebrate the blackest of nights 
To live in the darkness 
destroy the souls of all who beg 
for their mercy from the light 
To live without fear is the key 
to open your mind to the horrors 
that dwell deep inside 
Abide with me eternally 
I shall bring this earth to its knees 
you will beg for your mercy from me 
Like an animal I can sense your fear 
come to me and watch your pain disappear 
In your soul I have planted the seed 
my pestilent words have set the soul free 
Now oblivious to pain and remorse 
diablerie has taken its course 
Through your pain I receive my thrill 
Now reborn, your fear has subsided 
in legions you have found your place 
You are one of those forgotten 
souls that have forsaken that heavenly place 
Still I watch 
desecrate what you once loved 
paradise vanquished and stolen away 
Entombed in your personal hell 
through your pain I receive my thrill 
Enchanted by the beauty of death 
we'll celebrate the blackest of nights 
To live in the darkness 
destroy the souls of all who beg 
for their mercy from the light 
To live without fear is the key 
to open your mind to the horrors 
that dwell deep inside 
Abide with me eternally
