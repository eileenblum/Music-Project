Visio venit ut dormiebam 
Satis doctrinae postremo expleta rerum 
Futurarumque gestarum 
Portavit haec mihi visio 
Came on the wings of a storm 
to seal the fate of mankind 
Each shall bring a gift of horrors 
'til this world is no more 
Dark army marching 
cup of life runneth dry 
As the sobbing winds of death 
seep from a tortured grip 
from the bowels of life 
thou shalt slip 
Clouds churn amidst the horizon as 
thunder growls through the hills 
Now, worldwide mayhem and 
devastation, eternal war has begun 
Dark army marching 
born now to this world 
Leave no stone unturned 
leave in their wake 
the river of blood 
to cleanse the earth of its plague 
A time of chaos begins 
the day of reckoning for us all 
and although foreseen nothing 
could have prevented its horrors. 
Famine, Pollution, War and Death... 
our four gifts grow to earthly proportions 
The ones sworn to protect have turned on us all 
sweeping through every nation 
Decide now where your soul shall keep eternal slumber 
for no man shall escape death's suffocating embrace 
Awake to a world as black as night 
the devastated earth lit by sacrificial pyres 
The pungent scent of death burns my eyes, slowly 
I walk towards my fate 
Dark army marching 
cup of life runneth dry 
As the sobbing winds of death 
seep from a tortured grip 
from the bowels of life 
thou shalt slip 
Trapped in our earthly tomb we wait 
as the sun fights to break through 
but ashen snow from burning corpses 
chokes out the light, 
evoked eternal night 
Dark army marching 
born now to this world 
Leave no stone unturned, 
leave in their wake 
the river of blood 
to cleanse the earth of its plague 
Came on the wings of a storm 
and sealed the fate of mankind 
Each brought their gift of horror 
and this world is no more 
Dark army marching 
the cup of life has run dry 
As the sobbing winds of death 
seep from a tortured grip 
from the bowels of life thou hath slipped 
Clouds churn amidst the horizon 
thunder did growl through the hills 
darkness now reigns on this earth 
your blood has fueled the rebirth 
Dark army marching 
born now the new world 
Left no stone unturned 
left in their wake 
the river of blood 
has cleansed the earth of its plague.
