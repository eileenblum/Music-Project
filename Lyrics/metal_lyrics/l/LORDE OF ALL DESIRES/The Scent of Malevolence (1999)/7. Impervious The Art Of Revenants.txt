Nightfall come to me 
blessed be the unholy 
Come to cleanse impurity 
come to pass tranquility 
Ethereal mists pour over perished ruins 
Lands strewn with sulphurous solitude unveiled 
Timorous and slothful vengeful 
deeds become glory 
Destroyed in vain 
Tartarean prophecy prevailed 
Strength with eternal wisdom conversed 
Seduced from obedience 
bereaved of happiness divinity may partake 
Divested of temptation unwanted 
mused by sempiternal angst 
Imperium norm exhumed 
while His Divine Creation inhumed 
Held in potent voice 
the ardent and overshadowed seized at great length 
While boundless detriment with 
ubiquitous agony united 
Flames infinite and vacuous 
burn with boundless strength 
From the armory of hatred sprung 
forth furious winds 
Followed were the ashes of divinity purged 
Exordium to prolific ataxia long vanquished 
With pure darkness regained 
impervious the art of revenants 
Flames burn with boundless strength 
Impervious the art of revenants
