Tell me, tell me who, do you think you are? The parasites that live on my skin? More the birth control that just didn't win. In this game of heartache, I am all played out. And I thought we were looking for some put out, maybe I was wrong. Come on lets go, and paint this town dead. It's been too long, so call out all you headsman. Maybe I was wrong, Oh babe, you're so visibly morbid. Let's get alone and have those tragedies sorted. Maybe I was you. Now you, you don't like what you see. We are the ones, we are the ones. Try falling out of love with me. Now, you, you like car's back seat. We are the ones, we are the ones, I am the one. You know, in more ways than one, you have become something that I don't want. (You are nothing. Shit faces infected transvestite). If apathy has never been so en vogue, then I am cocaine in 1986, and I'm the silicone in your fake tits (you are nothing), and I'm the "you" in all your blogs, the end all be all of everything you've lost (you have lost).
