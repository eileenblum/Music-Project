Please don't look now, one fucked up dream, broadcast across the sea of the scenes, and you know this, smirking lightly. As tears run down your face, you forgot you (don't forget) need to scream rape. Duct tape never hurts when it's used in excess on your wrists. As the tears run down your face, you forgot you (you forgot, you forgot) need to scream rape. Duct tape never hurts when it's used in excess on your lips. Come on. Oh no, my god, we're here again, driving in circles down the wrong road (down the wrong road). If this was my, if this was my test (my test), then I have failed again, I have failed again, then I will leave the scene, but leave the mess. (leave the mess) One fucked up dream about to be. I could only be Mr. Right for the night. Intense, puking out lies of mistreated action, reaction,
reaction.
