Yeah, take my hand now darling, The snake's venom isn't strong enough to kill you, yet. Thats's what I call seduction. That's just what we call seduction. Quick, grab your things; the doctor's busy. Please God don't turn around now. I, and I think we left one fragment behind. Let's hope they dont catch on. I think we've made a huge mistake. Wait, let's turn back, I'm not in my coma just yet, but you could put me in one, I can still see the nurse and her electric shock still has my, my attention. Her electric shock and mine think as one. One, its time for your medicine, a straight shot to the brain. This room is full of hot shots now. I need at least one more dose. This room is full of hot shots now.
