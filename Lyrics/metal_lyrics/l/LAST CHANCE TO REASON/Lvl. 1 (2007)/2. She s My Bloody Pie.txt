Rely on your good luck, Intuition, and regret every word said because taking ain't easy. Streaks across the night sky have burnt in to my head. The lightbulb burned out when I left that bitch for dead. You've said enough, I don't believe a word you've said. Save your breath. Trust. Trustless. She's my, she's my bloody pie. Trust. I hope you never wake.
