Let's call the attention to the front of the room, because a story book ending is not called for. So let us chase sincerity with a good old friend of mine, he keeps his doors open all the time: JD be a dear and lift the gates up and let the wild boars in tonight. Its not disturbing, more than just a little deserving. More than anything you must help me put a little compromise in your dictation. This is all off the record, right? Open your mouth, close your eyes. I can see the flies come from inside. I can see the flies in your eyes.
