It's time to let the bastard in, and shut down his parallel. Is this a comedy or tragedy? One too many destinations for my laughter to cause an uproar, hold that tongue sir, because the whole cemetery has mine. Come one, come all, enter at your own risk. Don't feed the lions please, they lick their lips enough as it is. Enough now. Trust is a theory of parasites. Inside the mouth is the safest place to never go. Bullets for lovers are like knives for cutters, just remember little ones, it's down the street, not across the road.
Bullets, like knives, for cuts. This feeds on me.
