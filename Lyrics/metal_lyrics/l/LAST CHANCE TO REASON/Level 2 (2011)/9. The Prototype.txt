We the prototypes
Coded in the spherical image of the user's world
Sent to reformat, reprogram, rebirth the system
You are level 2
Systems: Linear science gone awry
Virus: Anarchistic desecration
The parabolic battle cry
We the prototype strands of knowledge from the user
We the prototype termination of this program

There is more to this cylindrical hell
A dimension outside where the user dwells
Technology dud not bring them peace / destruction, devastation
Prototype
Destructor of the 2D reviver of the concrete
