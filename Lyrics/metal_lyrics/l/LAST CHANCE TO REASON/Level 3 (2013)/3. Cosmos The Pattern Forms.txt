Cosmos in cold hard flux.

Consciousness spread first in the seas.
The smallest elements came to breed.
Increasingly complex this life became.
The universe reflected in its ways.

Consciousness waits,
the stars do not.
The pattern forms:
What becomes of this?
Consciousness waits,
the stars do not.
The pattern forms:
Each step more dense in connection.
