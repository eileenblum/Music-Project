Reforming, I awake.
No longer bound by the second dimension.

What is this form, this body?
Feel the anguish of life course through me.
Unfamiliar these senses,
this third dimension.
And so it begins...

I open my eyes,
I try to gain focus.
Color spectrum flowing with smooth gradients.
Depth perception laid out in grid form.

Reforming..
I awake
Strewn out before me
is a world collapsed.

Now I stare at cold reality.
I'm conscious, awakened.
Now I see a distorted,
shattered screen.
It reads, âERASINGâ.
