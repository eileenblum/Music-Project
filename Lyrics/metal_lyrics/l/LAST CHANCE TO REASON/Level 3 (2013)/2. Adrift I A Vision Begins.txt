Lay askew,
the image of man.
Everything's in ruins.

Geometric structures..
The image of man..
Lay askew, in ruin.

I raise my hand towards a still-luminescent structure.

Reflecting, refracting
the red orb as it rises.

Orbs of light and matter swirl and collide.
Matter's destroyed before order is formed.
