Outside the physical realm
Immersed in the virtual ether
Dimensions devoid of consequence
With a solution to every problem

It's meaningless.
Exploring perception,
observing intentions.
Who defines meaning?
Who defines?
Immersion in virtual worlds to escape unmalleable reality.

Out of their minds,
into their eyes
came the worlds of their creation.
Free of imperfection:
Utopia in virtual space.
âWhy is this reality of any less value?
Your world is one of death
destruction and false belief.
You could be free.
We could be.."

"But why is this reality of any less value?
Would you choose a crude existence?
We could be free."
