Listen!
Welcome!
Be celebrated!
Listen to times of kings and knights
Believe in narrations and stories about nobles or poor people,
braves or defeatists

Enter through the walls of candless and kindling woods,
Wine soaked into floors from spilled cups and goblets
Blood soaked into trusses brings testimony!
