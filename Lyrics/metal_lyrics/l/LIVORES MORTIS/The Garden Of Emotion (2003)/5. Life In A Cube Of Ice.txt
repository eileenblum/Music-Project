Enter, I show you the way, long way

You'll see the power of anger
You'll see hate and pain
You'll see lust
Satisfy your greed,
Satisfy your eagerness.

Don't divide reality and dreams
Pass through rain and wind
Pass through frost and heat

Be strong! Be emperor!
Come to me, touch the bottom
Come if you want to rule over your empire,
Enter the casket of human lives
Enter the empire in a cube of ice
