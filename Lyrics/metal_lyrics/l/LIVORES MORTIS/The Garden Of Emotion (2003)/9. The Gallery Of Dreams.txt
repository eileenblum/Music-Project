Water falls, rain cover base of thoughts
Walk through cold day...

In lake colours
I draw visins of night
In Gallery of dreams,
Where time is stopped.

I stop to count eternal dimensions,
Dimensions without borders

In lake colours
I draw visins of night
In Gallery of dreams,
Where time is stopped.
