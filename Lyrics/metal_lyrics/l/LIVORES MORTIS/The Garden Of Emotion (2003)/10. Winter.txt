Welcome ice queen
our winter queen,
welcome cold winds,
clouds and sins,
welcome to this land rich on treasures,
welcome to our beautiful land.

It is time to wake you
and open deep eyes,
it is time to rule
over the cold world.

Let rule cold silence,
sing lullaby to the whole land,
sing lullaby of winter frosts.

Snow-white sky
and frozen lakes,
cold wooden emptiness.

Put your face
in this beautiful land
our ice queen
raise up your hands...
