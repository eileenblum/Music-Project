I'm standing in storm...
I'm winking my eyes before  night comes
Appease my mind
before the Sun is hide beyond clouds
Fill my bucket
I'm standing in storm...

First drops of rain
whip my faces
Clouds of powder are raising

I'm waiting for heaven signal
I'm waiting for opening of gates of eternal temples
Birds fly away...

I'm standing in storm...
In the world of black clouds
I feel the power
Energy is poured together to clash
I enter  flames...
