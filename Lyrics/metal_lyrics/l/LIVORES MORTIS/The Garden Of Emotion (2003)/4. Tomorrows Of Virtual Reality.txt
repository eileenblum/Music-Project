Descendants, you wander through the labyrinth
and make still the same mistakes.
You have no speed, no power.

Your memory is crushed by new information
Go away! Everything changed!
You don't know what is dreaming, what is reality
Your way goes down

Why do you turn your body?
Don't raise up your heads!
I chose the place where you die!
There is no tomorrows for you...
