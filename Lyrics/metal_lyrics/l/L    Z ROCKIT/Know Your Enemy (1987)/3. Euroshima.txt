Victims of the future madness
No one listens to your voice
Can't believe that nothing changes
Can't believe they've got no choice
It's all been prophesied
Systematic genocide
The blinded fools
Headstrong ways
No one lives so no one pays

They'll call it Euroshima
Lay everything to waste
Remember Hiroshima
Before it's all too late

Tension rises causing panic
Leaders say their hands are tied
Something must be done that's drastic
They could end it all tonight
It's in the hands of fate
Intercept and penetrate
Who controls humanity
If there's no one left to see

They'll call it Euroshima
Lay everything to waste
Remember Hiroshima
Before it's all to late

Late for despair
Don't have a prayer
No future nowhere to go
Nowhere is home
You're not alone
Losing your mind and your soul

Victims of the future madness
When can we all see the light
If we're living in confusion
We've already lost the fight

It's all been prophesied
Systematic genocide
Who controls humanity
If there's no one left to see

They'll call it Euroshima
Lay everything to waste
Remember Hiroshima
Before it's all too late
All too late
All too late
All too late
