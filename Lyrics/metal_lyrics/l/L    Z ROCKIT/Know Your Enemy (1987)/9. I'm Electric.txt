Bomb's away
Just another crazy night
I can't delay
This hungry appetite
Now it's time
To show you how it's done
You're gonna find
I'm the only one

I'm coming at you
Can't see you
I'm Electric
I'm coming at you
Can't see you
I'm electric

Throw the switch
Turns my wheel in motion
I got the kicks
And the acceleration
Now you look at me
Like you've seen it all before
Want to cross my path
Knock you to the floor

I'm coming at you
Can't see you
I'm Electric
I'm coming at you
Can't see you
I'm electric

I'm coming at you
Can't see you
I'm Electric
I'm coming at you
Can't see you
I'm electric
