On a journey to another land
The hunters sailed into the night
Telling tales of a mystery
The warm mist blackened out the light
A pirate
A madman
So evil no one had seen
And lived to tell
As the shore drew near the silence broke
A sound the hunter knew so well
So well
The chosen
Had Fallen
To water
One place to go
One mystery

He swam on to the isle
With a sense of destiny
Deja'vu filled his mind
With a kind of lunacy
A castle on a cliff
Where shadows seemed to be alive
He held on to his heart
And wondered if he would survive

He's got to play the most
Dangerous game
His time to play the most
Dangerous game

The sea raged on below
As the general made his rules
To fight was certain death
And the hunter was no fool
Into the night he ran
Trying to stay one step ahead
He fought to keep his nerve
The final say is all that's said

He's got to play the most
Dangerous game
His time to play the most
Dangerous game

Black eyes
Seek their prey
There's no escape
Can't runaway
Fight Back
Seize your chance
Meet treachery
With Vigilance

The night time brought surprise
To the general's cold black eyes
The hunted turned to fight
Killing him was only right
And as the sunlight came
The final say had well been said
Sir Rainsford's sweet revenge
Was sleeping in the general's bed

He's got to play the most
Dangerous game
His time to play the most
Dangerous game
