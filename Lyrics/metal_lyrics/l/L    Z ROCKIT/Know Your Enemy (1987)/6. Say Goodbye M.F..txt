The legions prepared
To wage their attack
The soldiers of sin
Could be heard as they laughed
Merciless thieves
An unstoppable force
Have taken their aim
And decided their course
The hinge of fate is now

Strike as they stand
Spare no man
Say goodbye
Now feel their breath
Cold as death
Say goodbye

Regretless warfare
With vicious intent
No reason to think
No mind to repent
Sting of attack
Goes on through the night
The bringers of death
Have proven their might
They've come to cut you down

Strike as they stand
Spare no man
Say goodbye
Now feel their breath
Cold as death
Say goodbye

On until dawn
The fires are spawned
The spoils of the quest
Are saved for the strong
They've sounded the drum
A new king has come
To call this his land
Where he shall command
No man shall have his crown

Strike as they stand
Spare no man
Say goodbye
Now feel their breath
Cold as death
Say goodbye
