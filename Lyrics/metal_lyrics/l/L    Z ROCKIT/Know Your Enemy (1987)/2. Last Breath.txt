Time has come to greet fate
Destiny cannot wait
Your life's blood has run dry
Somewhere in the night sky

All these nightmares
All these past fears
Come back to you
From your past years

Running hard
Turning back
Feel the push
Feel the axe
See your name
In his sight
Taking aim
Your last fight

Take your last breath
Take your last breath
Take your last breath
Take your last breath

Turn your face to the sun
All is lost one by one
The ranks fall from the sky
Hear the call as they die

Desolation
Desperation
Running through you
Soul invasion

Carnage crazed
Dynamo
Feel the axe
Feel the blow
Caught in trance
From the scene
Vigilance
Just a dream

Take your last breath
Take your last breath
Take your last breath
Take your last breath

Silence comes so sweet
Feel the last heartbeat
Water in your eyes
And your throat so dry
Shadows in the sun
See your time has come
Take your final breath
Hear the call of death

Now you see winds of change
All the tears and the pain
All is lost for the cause
Freedom's call a mirage

All these nightmares
All these past fears
Come back to you
From your past years

Running hard
Turning back
Feel the push
Feel the axe
Caught in trance
From the scene
Vigilance
Just a dream

Take your last breath
Take your last breath
Take your last breath
Take your last breath
