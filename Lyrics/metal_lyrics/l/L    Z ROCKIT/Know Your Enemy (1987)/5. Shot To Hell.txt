They always said it would come
down to this
There is no time left to
reminisce
Chasing a dream can lead
you to ruin
Sometimes the best don't know what their doing

Losing my cool, Losing control
Nothing to add, Nothing to show
Digging myself deeper into this hole

[Chorus:]
Shot to hell
Shot to hell
It's all shot to hell
Shot to hell.

No one could take what these
eyes have seen
Cant make some sense of
What it could mean
Is it real or is it some kind of dream

[Chorus]

The visions lost
SHOT TO HELL
I count the cost
shot to hell
where can I turn
shot to hell
I feel the burn

Now its clear so easy to see,
this is a world thats not meant for me
only one that that I can truly be free.
I feel the burn
I count the cost
where can I turn
my visions lost

[Chorus]
