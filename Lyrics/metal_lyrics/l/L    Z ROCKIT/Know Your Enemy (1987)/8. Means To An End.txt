The time is here
Won't be ruled by this fear
A chance has come
The deed must be done
My spirit cries
As my blood start to rise
It's shown the way
Not a word I can say
My back's to the wall
This is it
I stand or fall
I'm loosing ground
But I'm still around

I Still can see
As blood is red
I'll always find
A means to an end
Right or wrong
It's the same old song
Now I know

I've walked that line
Never seeing the sign
A man  must know
What lies in his soul
I've got to see
My lost identity
Can it be true
Is there nothing I can do
This is it
I stand or fall
I'm loosing ground
But I'm still around

I Still can see
As blood is red
I'll always find
A means to an end
Right or wrong
It's the same old song
Now I know

I Still can see
As blood is red
I'll always find
A means to an end
Right or wrong
It's the same old song
Now I know
