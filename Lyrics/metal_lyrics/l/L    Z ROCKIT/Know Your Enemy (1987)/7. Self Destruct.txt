Here comes that feeling
My head is reeling
Feel like a number
Breath getting shorter
I've reached the point of no return
I'm fading fast as my blood runs cold
Pressure seems like a stranglehold
Getting crushed as the walls cave in
Pay the man for your final sin
Feel like a number
Breath getting shorter
I can see no future
I can go no further

Nothing left
Self destruct
Lose my head
Self destruct
Chance this threat
Self destruct
Race with death
Self destruct

So you're a fighter
Rocket igniter
come taste the fire
It's your desire
I've seen so many crash and burn
So you think you can beat the test
You're gonna die like all the rest
Your head is heavy and you still don't see
Lost your mind to a bad disease
Come taste the fire
It's your desire
Your heart feels so frozen
To find you've been chosen

Nothing left
Self destruct
Lose my head
Self destruct
Chance this threat
Self destruct
Race with death
Self destruct

Come taste the fire
it's your desire
you can see no future
you can go no further

Nothing left
Self destruct
Lose my head
Self destruct
Chance this threat
Self destruct
Race with death
Self destruct
