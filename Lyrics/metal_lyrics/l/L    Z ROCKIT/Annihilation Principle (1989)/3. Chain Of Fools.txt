Hello again my fuckin' fair weather friend
I'm right here in your face man
My sweet revenge
I see it in your eyes each day
I think it's time you face the shame
I finally broke my ball and chain

I know you've always tried to drag me down
I know that shit you talk
When I'm not around
All your lies only make me see
You're just a slut, my little queen
I want to see you on your knees

Don't want to hear your accusation
I've got to change the situation

Now I see the writing on the wall
Once and for all
The chain of fools has got to take a fall
Once and for all

How does it feel now?
How does it taste?
All your good medicine
Can't heal this disgrace
Fair weather friend, I know your kind
You see no better than the blind
Don't talk to me, don't waste my time

Don't want to hear your accusation
Now I've changed situation

Now I see the writing on the wall
Once and for all
This chain of fools will take its final fall
