Times here are changing
You're so out of touch
Crack just don't do it
Speed's never enough
Take a good look at yourself
Can't you see
You're crossing the line
Now your life's a tragedy

End of the line
You're losing this time
Paying the price
Shootin' fools dice

Chasing the night
Such a wild renegade
Living in hell
In a fool's masquerade
Riding your way
On the white jagged edge
Now you believe
And you're better off dead

Word to the wise
It's a lying disguise
All this runnin' around
it's taken you down

Looking in the mirror to madness
Mirror to madness

Daydreams and nightmares
You see it too late
Voices inside you
No way to escape
The life of a fool
Is a pitiful sight
In war with yourself
You've lost to the night

Word to the wise
It's a lying disguise
Paying the price
Shootin' fools dice

Looking in the mirror to madness
Mirror to madness
