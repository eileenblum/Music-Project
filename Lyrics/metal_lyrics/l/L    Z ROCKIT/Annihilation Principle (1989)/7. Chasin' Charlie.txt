Nineteen
To the day
Such an age
What a waste
come with me
My uncle says
To a land
Where no one cares
You'll see
Such a different light
Learn to live
Learn to fight
Gamble
With your life
Every day and
Every night
Keep your cool
Shoot others dead
watch your back
And watch your head
Murder here's
The way of life
You must see this
To survive

He rules the night we own the day
Come play the game
Chasin' Charlie
To see the sun all that I pray
Come play the game
Chasin' Charlie

Such a sin
Welcome to
A graveyard zoo
Execute!
Chasin' Charlie
Chasin' Charlie
Chasin' Charlie
Chasin' Charlie

Nineteen
Such an age
War machine
For our rage
Stay with me
My uncle says
It's your country
That's at stake
Serve your nation
Serve with pride
Fight for those
Who fought and died

Bad dream
Come to life
Justice
Out of sight
Charlie's out there
Every night
Calling you to
Come and fight
Grab your sixteen
Chase him down
Drive him back
Into the ground

He rules the night we own the day
Come play the game
Chasin' Charlie
To see the sun all that I pray
Come play the game
Chasin' Charlie

Welcome to
A graveyard zoo
Execute!
Chasin' Charlie
Chasin' Charlie
Chasin' Charlie
Chasin' Charlie
