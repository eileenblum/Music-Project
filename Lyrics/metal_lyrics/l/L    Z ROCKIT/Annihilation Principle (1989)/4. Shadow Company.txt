Shatter the silence
Of another cold night
Screaming
Power of violence
A rebellious fight
Raging
Voices are calling
Play with your mind
Dreaming
Stop me I'm falling
Lost all my time
Praying

Now there's no one
Who can you count on?
Where does it all end?
Call to the father
He doesn't bother
He's got his own vice
Keeping the peace
For the fortunate few

Searching for reason
While under fire
Reaching
Running is treason
Walking the wire
Scheming

Pressure is building
Through all this killing
Will I see home again?
Call to the father
He doesn't answer
He's got his own vice
Keeping the peace
For the fortunate few

Make your stand
Take command
Keeping to the shadows
Running through the night
There's no guarantee
Risk your life
Shadow company
Do or die

Brothers in arms
Comrades to the death
Fighting
Losing your fear
Rise to the test
Killing
Raging all night
Rampage 'til dawn
Driving
Live for the fight
Only the strong
Willing

Breaking the walls down
Being a bloodhound
Law's in your own hands
Hear me now father
I'm getting stronger
Your just got no time
To listen to someone who doesn't believe

Make your stand
Take command
Keeping to the shadows
Running through the night
There's no guarantee
Risk your life
Shadow company
Do or die
