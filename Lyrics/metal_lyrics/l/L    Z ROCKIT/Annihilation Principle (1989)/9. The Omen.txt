There was a time
When I called the night my friend
And felt no pain
Only a child
And the light of innocence
Burned bright as day
Flesh and blood
The ties of life we're one and same
Pure freedom
Born to share his brother's name

Feeling the rain
I've felt a thousand times before
Yet it seems so cold
Dove white as snow
Trying to weather one more storm
Lays on the ground
Broken wings
Helpless from the fate it's given
Fragile thing
I couldn't save it from it's cruel end

Innocent one
Comes upon a cold device
And time stands still
Sound of a shot
And his heart turns cold as ice
Life unfulfilled
All my guilt
I wished I was the one to die
Brother killed
Now I live to question why

Search my soul to try and find a reason
Losing faith in all that I believe in

Shade my eyes
From the windows of the past
Too late to save
Promise has died
With a vision that can't last
To fate a slave
Piece by piece
I've tried to mend my heart forsaken
No release
A nightmare and I can't awaken

Search my soul to try and find a reason
Losing faith in all that I believe in
Now I know that the bird was a sign
The blame for this forever will be mine
