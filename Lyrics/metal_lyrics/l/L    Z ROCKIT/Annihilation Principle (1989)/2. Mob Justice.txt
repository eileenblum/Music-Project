It's every day
Some things just don't go away
Out of control
There's no escape from your hell-hole

It's quite a fright to see them
Looking for you
Asking me questions and I don't know
What to do

You're out of time
Your luck just ran out this time
No place to hide
You better watch your backside

Last night they came to see you
Blow you away
You're running nowhere and they wanna
Have their say

Running under the gun
What's done is done
They never miss
It's mob justice

Long time no see man
We got something for you

Look at you now
Six feet below the playground
They got you good
Just like I always said they would

Running under the gun
What's done is done
They never miss
It's mob justice

I tried to save your skin man
Just good advice
You ain't got no time, no chance
To stop and listen to the wise

Fallen under the gun
What's done is done
They never miss
It's mob justice
