There was a man, lived on the take
called Hell his home, used sex for rape
All his victims chosen by hand
all the wise men couldn't understand
Madman at nightime, laughing at day
no one could stop him, he had his way
Endless terror, London at bay
and his mystery still lives on today

The city turning upside down
No answer where he could be found
Watch yourself when you're alone
Throw the chains around your home

Bad Blood, out on the streets
Bad Blood, an evil seed
Bad Blood, loose on the streets
Bad Blood, come out and see

Born to destroy, legend of fear
God help us all should he appear
Someone's watching, feel the chill
no solution for all he killed

The city turning upside down
No answer where he could be found
Watch yourself when you're alone
Throw the chains around your home

Bad Blood, out on the streets
Bad Blood, an evil seed
Bad Blood, loose on the streets
Bad Blood, come out and see

Now all you ladies who work at night
here is a story, makes you think twice
Someone's watching, don't turn your back
don't turn tricks for One-eyed Jack

The city turning upside down
No answer where he could be found
Watch yourself when you're alone
Throw the chains around your home

Bad Blood, out on the streets
Bad Blood, an evil seed
Bad Blood, loose on the streets
Bad Blood, come out and see

My passion running high
Last I will decapitate your pretty lit
