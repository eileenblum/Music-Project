You're a silent witness
till the end of time
Never saying what you saw
Still haunts your mind
What we leave behind
Never fades away
You're the one who keeps hiding the truth
You're a lie

Looking for deliverance
But you can't escape
Never placing any guilt
On the one to blame
I can see the pain within your eyes
You're just running
And going insane
You're a lie
Don't you see
That your hands will be stained
You're a lie

[Chorus:]
You can't release the truth
Your silence is a lie
It's locked inside of you
Your silence is a lie
You're losing sanity
'Cause silence is a lie
Stay blind to what you see
And silence is a lie

Broken alibis
And you still forget
Devil in disguise
Says your soul is kept
You're just running
And going insane
You're a lie
Don't you see
That your hands have been stained
You're a lie

[Chorus]

You can't release the truth
Your silence is a lie
It's locked inside of you
Your silence is a lie
You're losing sanity
'Cause silence is a lie
Stay blind to what you see
And silence is a lie
