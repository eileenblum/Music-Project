Troubled man on your own
Work your fingers to the bone
Looking for another way
To free yourself
And break the chain
Persuasion always leads you to
the edge
Gonna lose your head

Take the chance and break the vow
Money makes this world go 'round
Steal your way with greedy eyes
No one sees
And no one's wise
Seduction comes in many wicked ways
But everybody pays

[Chorus:]
Curiosity kills
Come and play with fire
Curiosity kills
Maybe you'll get burned
Curiosity kills
Maybe you'll find out what you're
Missing
Curiosity kills
Dying ain't no way of living

Shattered by your desperate fight
Obsession is a way of life
Now your world comes down on you
The blame is yours
Face the truth
Temptation gets the best of any man
Now you understand

[Chorus]
