Welcome to this crazy world
Can't you see what it's done to me
Losing touch and I've lost control
Things ain't what they seem to be
I know you see
It's my reality
I'm lost in pain
I'll never be the same
What's the use of screaming
No one hears you shout
No one gives a damn
What it's all about

[Chorus:]
They're taking me to the asylum
Come along for the ride
I can hear voices calling
Get them out of my mind

Look at those who make the rules
Trying to tell me what to say
Living in a world of fools
Heading for the judgement day
No light no sound
There's blindness all around
No love no life
It seems like suicide
They won't listen to me
Can't you hear the voice
God I must be dreaming
Someone stop the noise

[Chorus]

Now my mind is not my own
There's no chance to get it free
These four walls are now my home
No one sees the things I see
What's the use of screaming
No one hears you shout
No one gives a fucking damn
What it's all about

[Chorus]

They're taking me to the asylum
Come along for the ride
I can hear voices calling
Get them out of my mind
They're taking me to the asylum
Come along for the ride
