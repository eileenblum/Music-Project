Look at the way you live
Your back's against the wall
Just like a fugitive

That's running from the law
See your reflection
See the window to the soul
It brings the darkest fears
A loss of all control
I believe that it's a murder of the mind
You can't come back once you've crossed that line
What kind of life is this when all you know is pain
No one left to leave you, no one knows your name

No one can ever know
The evil nature in our hearts
It's just like wildfire
Once it starts it never stops
Never trust your senses
Never trust the man in black
His empty promises
Lead you down a broken path
Take a look at what your world has become
There's no way to right the damage that's been done
What kind of life is this when all you know is pain
No one left to leave you, no one knows your name

[Chorus:]
We all fight the enemy within
it's the fight you can never win
We all fight the enemy within
it's a fight until the bitter end

Now you can't understand
what's happened to your life
You're left there standing still
While others pass you by
You slowly slip away
On alcohol and pills
Just a wasted man
Living life that kills

[Chorus]
