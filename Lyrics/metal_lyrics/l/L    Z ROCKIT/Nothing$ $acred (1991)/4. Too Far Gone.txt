One foot standing in the grave
One more shot is all you need you say
Poison running through your veins
That dirty needle driving you insane

Addiction hides you from the truth
Can't you see the things it
makes you do
No one wants to see your face
Now live in shame with your cold disgrace

Falling to the ground
screaming without a sound
Fading into black
Praying you come back

[Chorus:]
Can't you see
That you're dancing on the edge
Once you're lucky, twice you die
But you're too far gone
You need another rush
Like a bullet in the head
You once were lucky,
Now you're dead
And you're too far gone

Caught up in your world of pain
All you want is to be high again
Speeding to your last dead end
You never listened to a word I said

Falling to the ground
Screaming without a sound
Fading into black
Praying you come back

[Chorus]
