Let the night begin
Come and take my hand
Won't you walk with me
To the promised land
Bring your dreams along
And anything that you desire
Sometimes what we want
Only throws us in the fire

You walk the streets
No one knows your name
All the people stare
But they don't share your pain
Waiting for tomorrow
Living each day as your last
Numb to all the sorrow
In the nightmare of your past

[Chorus:]
Someone gets me out of here
Suicide City
I can't take this anymore
Suicide City
I don't want to die alone
Suicide City
Someone please...help me

When you pray tonight
Please say one for me
Don't let these city lights
steal my soul without a fight
Living emptyhanded
No one's as they seem to be
Looking at the ashes
of what were once such sweet
dreams

[Chorus]
