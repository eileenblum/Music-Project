I know you're alone again
And it's hard to face the day
And I know that I can't help you
Change your ways
Now there's nothing left
But it seems I can forget
How we left it slip away so easily

Now the years can't take away
All these broken memories
And the promises we tried
So hard to keep
It gets harder every night
Now you're so far out of sight
I'm looking for a miracle to bring you home

[Chorus:]
Nobody's child
Find your way back home tonight
All is forgiven
An all is right

You can't run forever
Open up your eyes and see
It's never over, never over

Nobody's child
Come back to me

[Chorus]
