[Bonus track]

Heading for the southlands,
Down Texas way
Ready for the lightening
Of the chainsaw blade.

[Chorus:]
Here's your invitation to come
Join leatherface,
It's his addiction to keep you face to face

Screaming in the darkness,
After nailing you down,
Swinging the hammer,
No one hears a sound

[Chorus]

You're just a prisoner
In his game of chance,
Another rivalry
For the devils dance.

Come across the crossroads,
Chainsaw running wild,
Going to the heavens,
For the final time.

[Chorus]
