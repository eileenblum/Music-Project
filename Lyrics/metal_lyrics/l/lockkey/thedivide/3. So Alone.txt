I search so alone.

Have you ever felt yourself fall apart,
With nothing left alone in the dark?
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving up.

What I'd give for a time when things made sense,
When things were simple, so alone.
When I knew who I was,
When my worries were at bay, so alone.
And when I lost my way,
There was no one standing there, so alone.
I was left alone with these thoughts,
I swore I'd never felt so alone.

Have you ever felt yourself fall apart,
With nothing left alone in the dark?
We're not giving in
We're giving up.

Should I save my breath or waste these words,
On a situation that constantly turns for the worse,
What the future holds I don't know,
But right now this situations making me feel so alone.
And when I lost my way,
There was no one standing there, so alone.
I was left alone with these thoughts,
I swore I'd never felt so alone.

Everything I knew fell apart,
I watched it burn.

Have you ever felt yourself fall apart,
With nothing left alone in the dark?
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving up.
