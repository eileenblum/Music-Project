Iâm holding out for a better day
Things stay the same.
Iâm so tired of trying to find a better way
I am running on empty.

In every place I look surrounding me,
Weâre told which side of the line to stand.
We wonât give in we wonât back down we wonât let go.
Weâll make our stand we wonât be moved itâs a way of life.

There is no respect.
The end is in sight,
There was once unity and peace that filled these streets.
Now our dreams are brutally beat
Weâre left with nothing in our hands.
Weâre left with nothing.

Iâm holding out for a better day
Things stay the same.
Iâm so tired of trying to find a better way
I am running on empty.

With every word I hear form you.
Youâve never been so far form the truth.
We wonât give in we wonât back down we wonât let go.
Weâll make our stand we wonât be moved itâs a way of life.

A way of life.
You pulled me down again to the lowest point.
Never again.
Demand respect but I have nothing left to give.
Never again.

Recklessly placing faith in idle hands.
Losing sight of things that I hold so close.
My dreams once so bright
They burn to embers

Iâm holding out for a better day.
Iâm holding out.

Iâm holding out for a better day
Things stay the same.
Iâm so tired of trying to find a better way
I am running on empty.
