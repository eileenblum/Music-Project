Every dayâs like a fist fight with myself,
This ainât going nowhere fast.
I watched them slip away
While I held on by a thread of this rope thatâs burning.
I saw them suffer in their final moments,
Itâs hard to find hope,
When youâre surrounded by first hand failures

First hand failure,

I prayed to a God who I didnât believe,
Cause desperation was all I knew.
I tried and I tried to stand on my feet
But my mind just kept me to the ground

I know this feeling all too well,
Cause every night is a living hell.
Iâm down on my knees, down on my luck
Iâm down on my luck.
Iâve felt like this from time to time,
And Iâm not sleeping well at night.
Iâm down on my knees, down on my luck.
Iâm down on my luck.

Keep moving forward.

Iâm down on my knees, down my luck
Iâm down on my luck.

And Iâm not sleeping well at night.
Iâm down on my knees, down on my luck.
Iâm down on my on my luck.

Never again, will I let someone in.

But I just kept telling myself that if the struggle was easy,
It wouldnât be worth it.
