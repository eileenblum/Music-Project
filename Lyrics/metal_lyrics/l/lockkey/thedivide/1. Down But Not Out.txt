Cries to this world forever fall on deaf ears.
Too much time is placed in reckless hands.

Cries to the past, I remember the facts.
Down but not out.
I won't let my fears consume me,
Living the life I was destined for.
Down but not out.

Spent a lifetime trying to fill these shoes by standards set.
But I know, there will be no regret.
I face this alone, walked the road of no return.
I faced this alone.

The angst that we feel's never ending, it's no use pretending.
Cause they don't understand.
In the end it was worth it, now we are hurting.
We'll take the upper hand.

The thoughts in my mind always haunt my life but I'm
Down but not out.
I moved on from who I was but sometimes the past I can't outrun
Down but not out.

I just wanna be something, someone just like you.
I wanna be somewhere so I can leave these worries behind.
Just like you.

The angst that we feel's never ending, it's no use pretending.
Cause they don't understand.
In the end it was worth it, now we are hurting.
We'll take the upper hand.

Cries to this world forever fall on deaf ears.
Too much time is placed in reckless hands.
