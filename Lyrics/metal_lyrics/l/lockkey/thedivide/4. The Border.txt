Our pain, our pride.
Itâs everything I hold inside.
Weâll never fall to our knees
cause I know that we tried.
Never give in, never look back.
Iâll never give in, Iâll never look back.
Time is short so make sure that it counts for something.

Who would know the things that bought us together
would tear us apart?
You arenât the same you used to be.
You lost your way with the art.
We are divided I have my line and you got yours.
I will never lose my way more forward and stop wars.

I know this all too well to be left alone
To cave in
I watched from the inside out I wore I wouldnât make it
To the end.
No I wonât I refuse itâs the end of my days
I refuse

These words, this struggle.
This life, the endless driving force.
Mean more to me than anything.
Without this we are nothing
Without this we are nothing
Our pain our pride.
Everything I hold inside
No borders to hold me back.
I found that place inside myself I found myself.

You lose your way somewhere along the line.
Itâs not a forgotten time.
Now you resent everything you used to be a part of.
We are divided I have my line and you got yours.
I will never lose my way, move forward and stop wars

I know this all too well to be left alone
To cave in.
I watched from the inside out I swore I wouldnât make it
To the end.
No I wonât. I refuse itâs the end of my days.
I refuse.

I have faith in this, I know things can change.
I wonât ever be silenced.
Iâll tear down your borders.
I see through the small minds with big mouths
Words laced with ignorance.
Who would know these things, that brought us together
Would be the things to tear us apart?
