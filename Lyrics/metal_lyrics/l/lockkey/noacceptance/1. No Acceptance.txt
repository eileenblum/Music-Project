Mouths like to talk
Sometimes we lose a battle to win a war
we'll never belong
No acceptance

Paved the way ourselves
This is my legacy
At least I stand for something
No acceptance

Refusing to be forgotten
These words will ring out
I'm dying to live for me
No one else

No time for close minds you can't keep us down
More important things matter than
No acceptance

I feel like we fought this war alone
Based on prejudgment
In a place that's meant to feel like home
There's no acceptance

I've never felt so unwelcome
Knew how it would go down
We don't belong here
No acceptance

We've been driven for far too long
Pushed to the edge
From a place we don't belong
No acceptance

We've been driven for far too long
From a place we don't belong
Well I won't be caving in
In a place I don't fit

I feel like we fought this war alone.

I feel like we fought this war alone
Based on prejudgment
In a place that's meant to feel like home
There's no acceptance
