They control our thoughts to predict our actions
They deprive the people of words which allows, them to defend themselves
They deprive the people of mind not to put up any resistance
They lie to our faces, everything is under democratic control
Orwell's 1984 in its purest form
The final question is "What does freedom really mean?"
