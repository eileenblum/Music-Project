Fighting the time, you have a lead which will take you to the ultimate damnation
You've started to see the variety of everything &amp; the life
All that is hidden to everyone else
You keep the distance from people you know, your friends
Life values you've laid in hands of emptiness
Joy, insight of sleepless nights turns into predeath agony
Like a beast trapped, you strive to crawl up to see the hope until you say nevermore
You are losing the battle; your body is in the abyss wanting more &amp; more shit
It changed you into a monster, the shadow of your own thoughts
Your days are numbered, you don't live, you survive, you're snuffing it
