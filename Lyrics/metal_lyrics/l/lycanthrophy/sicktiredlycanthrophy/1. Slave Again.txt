You mean nothing
Kept as an item in the record of the easily redundant
You get nothing
Being sterilized &amp; deprogrammed from the dignity of life, beginning to be useless
You say nothing
Rope in your neck, it chokes you, it takes away the idea of the last defiance to say
No more
I can't
You're broken
For the powerful &amp; greedy ones, slave again
