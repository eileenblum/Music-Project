Lost hours on empty words
Mood initiations changing the nature of the unimportance
Swallowing faces with no expressions, waiting for nonsense with no values
Formless letters in columns of words, full of impressions, feelings for a fantastic friendship
Being skillful, be of logical mind is the past long gone
Switch off he machines, close your notebooks, start to live in real world, the real friendship
