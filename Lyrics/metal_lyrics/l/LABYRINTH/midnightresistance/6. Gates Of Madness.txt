In my life, in my soul
In my memory I live my dream

(you) take my life, take my soul
take my memory, we lost an year.

This confusion is my agony
My life is lonely but I'm born to need no one

Oh my god you know I'm out of my head
...my heart is sad

Living in dreams trough your eyes
...I drop to the sky
...What's up in my mind?

Imagination makes dreams reality
I walk with my shadow
searching for the truth
I live and learn by my mistakes
