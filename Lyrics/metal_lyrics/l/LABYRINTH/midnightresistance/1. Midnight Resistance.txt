Staying behind the stars
I look at the world and I listen to reason...
I hear an innocent voice, it whisper me a new law
whispers me the way
and I'm sleeping with my dreams

And other crimes and violation
political mistake
everything went according to plan
I made the mistake to trust in them

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

Look another way
when moonlight takes the sky
I see the shadows of nighttime
spinning around me...
A mirage in the night
It's a magic for my heart
a drop stolen from the Sea of Eternity

And other crimes and violation
political mistake
everything went according to plan
I made the mistake to trust in them

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight...

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight...
