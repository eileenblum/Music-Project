I've walked in the street of yesterday
I've talked with your eyes as blue the sky

And we learned the hard way
we wanted to live forever
every way together

walking to red zone to the silence of night
I've looked at the city of yesterday

And we've paid with our lives
we'd wanted to live forever
every way together

I've broken everything I've made...
...we've wanted to live forever
every way together...
