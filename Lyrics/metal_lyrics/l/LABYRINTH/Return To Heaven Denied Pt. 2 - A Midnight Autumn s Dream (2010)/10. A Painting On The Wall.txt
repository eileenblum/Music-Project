Like a hall with paintings on the wall
In our mind are living memories
Pictures of our life
They won't ever fade away
Living there for us to see
Whenever we need

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

When tomorrow you will cry alone
Dry your tears, don't think of what you've lost
Think of what you had
Take your brushes, do it then
Paint it all before it fades, lost in time

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone
