Lie down
Close your eyes and start dreaming on
Call me, in the rays of the moonlight I'll come

Cry now, and spit out all the sorrow
Through pain, you made it to survive
Tears fall, while memories are calling
This life just broke your heart in two

Before the dawn announces a new day
Tonight we have a chance to live our dream
And make it happen to meet again

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

The sound of stars is like some music
Your voice is whispering my name
Go back to dreamland and just call me
Then wait, I promise I'll be there

Before the dawn tears this night away
I'll find again the way to reach your soul
And once again I'll make it through the maze

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

Before the dawn tears this night away
I'll find again the way to reach your soul
And once again I'll make it through the maze

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free
