Dear, I'm here
Look at me
After so many years I'm once again with you
Now put your hand on my heart

We were free and we were one
Tonight it's you and me and no one else around
Come and stay here by my side, and let's fly again

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banished me from heaven
You gave me light

Lost in time
I tried to reach you
I crossed the mists of time, the trip was long and tough
My love for you took me back to life again

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banned me out of heaven
You gave me light

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banned me out of heaven
You gave me light

We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive

We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive

We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive

We all live in the past
But our hope still alive

We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
