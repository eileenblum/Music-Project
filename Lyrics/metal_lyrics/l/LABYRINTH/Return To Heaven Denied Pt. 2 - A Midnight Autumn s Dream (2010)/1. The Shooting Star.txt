Eleven years have been passing by
But dust didn't cover your memories
Time didn't make it all fade away
Pictures of something we've lived
They're all still there...

Walking on the edge of forever, like a feather in the wind
We've no chance to choose, and the breeze is our guiding light, in the night

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to break free

Eleven years, would you say so much?
Time didn't warn us while running
What has remained of all that we had
It got covered by sands of time
(But) it still lived in our minds

Reaching for the edge of forever, unlike feathers in the wind
We refused to be taken everywhere the wind was blowing, walking on our path

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to break free

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to be free

Walking on the edge of forever..
Waiting for a sign..
Walking we are feathers in the wind..
Waiting just for a little sign
