It was nice, but now I realize you were not here
Seemed so true, (I) still feel you on my skin
In this void I remain

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

I never prayed, but in this morning light
Lord, I need your bless
Take this soul or give me back again
All I had last night

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart
