Follow me
Where the time's no rules
Where the space is not a bound
Come with me
In the dusk we'll dance
While the stars will glitter all around

We will fly
Through the bluest skies
To the infinite together
No more pain
Running inside your veins
We will make our way to heaven

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

Drops of dew
In the morning's light
The first dawn of our new life

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

We are sailors
