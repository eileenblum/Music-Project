There's no time to waste
They're still on our path
Like hound dogs with their prey
But they can't read your mind
Princess of the night
Still your dreams are safe

Open gates of dreamland
That's the only way to escape

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

So they are fed by hate
They can't stand our pride
(As) We don't fear their might

The skies will break and fall
Till they find us all
Bounded by their lore

Open gates of dreamland
That's the only way to escape

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown
