I can't forget
When I saw you the first time
It seems a life ago
Still I recall
A single smile from you
And I felt the peace of mind
The storm I had inside
Suddenly turned into quiet

Was it luck, or fate?
I don't know, trust me
But it's real and I won't ever let it go

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

Now take my hand
And let's do the walk of life
Together if you want
Side by side

Now take my hand
And let's do the walk of life
Together if you want
Side by side

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

Was it luck, or fate?
I don't know, trust me
But it's real and I won't ever let it go

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight
