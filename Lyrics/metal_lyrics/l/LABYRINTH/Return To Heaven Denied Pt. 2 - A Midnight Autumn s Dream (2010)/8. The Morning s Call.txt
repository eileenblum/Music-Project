Every night comes to an end
And the dark must make way to the incoming light
For how magic was this dream
A new dawn comes in place of the night

Look at the rising sun
It's calling sleepers to wake

Black is turning into blue
Blue will turn then into black in this turnabout

It's time to go, pale moon
The sunlight claims for it's time

When sun rises up
It's time to awake
And leave your dreams with the dying night
Stand up and live
Walk in the new dawn, and hear the morning's call

Turn your head in bed
And be ready to leave the lands of fantasy
Time to go back to reality
But I'll live on inside your mind

It's time to go, pale moon
The sunlight claims for it's time

When sun rises up
It's time to awake
And leave your dreams with the dying night
Stand up and live
Walk in the new dawn, and hear the morning's call
