Angel's voices are calling me
Don't know if I'm strong enough
I'll be there to see and hear
If the thunder roars again
The anger in me is still alive
I'm brandishing my sword against all odds

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

The wolves in me are now unleashed
The gods above are blessing me
If I don't come back don't cry
Get ready to take on my legacy

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea]

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage
