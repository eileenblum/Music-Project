All around things are changing
For everyone of us
I feel the need to rest my heart and mind

Go, if you wanna go
And never look back in anger
But if you wanna stay
Measure all your words, you don't have to complain
Sooner or later
It'll be your turn again
Are you experienced to hold the reins?

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

No! Maybe you don't know
Our brain is infected
Stop look into my eyes
And tell me where we went wrong
Once and for all
Sooner or later
It'll be your turn again
Are you experienced to keep the route?

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

[Solo: Oleg / Olaf / Andrea]

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

Don't be afraid today
The sands are flowing and a new dream will come for each one of us
