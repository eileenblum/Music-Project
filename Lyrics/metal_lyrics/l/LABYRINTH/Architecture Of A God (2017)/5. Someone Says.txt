I woke up in silence
With another day of life ahead
I'm breathing I'm feeling like before a hurricane
No boredom and no turning back
We start again

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

Rain's falling on wet ground
Nothing seems like yesterday
I'm rolling my two dices
Trying to fool and change my fate
No boredom and no turning back
Life's ahead

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea / Oleg]

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

From the darkness to the morning light
Trying to fix the pain I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
Now I can
