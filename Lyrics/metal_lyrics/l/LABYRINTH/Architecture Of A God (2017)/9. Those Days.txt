Between space and time there's only a this curtain
You will find me there just for a little while
Everything was lost or at least is what I thought
It's not over yet but the worst is over
Call my name and the sunshine wakes me up
From a winter's tale that froze all my hopes

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

I never understand, what's forever for
An eternal flame weaker than a candle
Feel my pain that now is vanishing
Finally I can breathe and I give myself to you

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf]

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days
