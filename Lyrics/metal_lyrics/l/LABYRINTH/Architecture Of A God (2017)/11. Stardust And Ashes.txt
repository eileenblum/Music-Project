Scream from the top of your lungs
All your despair
Hear the echo of your regrets
There is an inner voice that says
Don't complain!
You're made of stardust and ashes my friend

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

Feel deep down inside the pain you have caused
Stop to blame someone else, face your guilt
Cry a river of tears to save your soul
Pay for your dues there is so much to do

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf / Nik / Oleg]

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness
