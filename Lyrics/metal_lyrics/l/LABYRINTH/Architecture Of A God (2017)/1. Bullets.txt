I saw misery and scorn
From who has no respect for life
They are trying to make us slaves
Through false religions and lies
No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
Is so thin, impossible to see
Nothing is free

We are running out of time
And all our certainties are shattered and scattered
Blood is turned into mud
There is nothing to say
The damage is done

The last bow to a stunned crowd
And an AK starts to sing
Bullets are filling the air
Cowardice has never been stronger than this
No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
It's so thin impossible to see
Nothing is free

[Solo: Olaf, Andrea, Oleg]

No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
It's so thin impossible to see
Nothing is free

We are running out of time
And all our certainties are shattered and scattered
Blood is turned into mud
There is nothing to say
The damage is done
