From the biosphere to the deepest sea
We search for freedom and serenity
Our wings are strong enough to bare the winds
Blowing as they never did before
Don't you forget our name, it's carved in hard stone
Don't let our faces fade away, be gone
Louder our chant resounds, tonight we're coming
Listen to what we're crying

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

Time is almost due but no one seems to care
This road is bringing us straight to nowhere
Anyway I will be there to take your hand
Showing you the path to the new world
Did you forget our names?
They're carved in those stones
Did you just let our faces fade away?
Open your eyes up wide, 'cause we're back for good
Listen to what we're crying

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea]

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay
