[Lyrics: Mangnani]

Light me now
There is a Light coming from S.O.U.L.-W.A.I.S.T.E.
This time, your voice is calling me
Moonlight so sweetly winds the maze
hard time, now I realize the ways to go

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

all your love

A light kills my enemy it shows her
Goodbye, my only hope is freedom
but you, I please you, don't be afraid
be sure one day I'll find the way

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
What do you need? I see tears in your eyes
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

Over, all alone you queen of Dreamland
I'm flying away
all the Visions behind me,
and the time has gone away

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
What do you need? I see tears in your eyes
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
