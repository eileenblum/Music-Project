Night is leaving too early
My dreams are falling away
I lie dreaming to run close
Why are you fading away from me?

Lost in you I'm going nowhere
Searching for the land of dreams (where do you live?)
Are you somewhereâsomewhere in my mind?
In Dreamland?

A light flashes my mind
Brightening finally all the air
You standing tall watching me
Your eyes are pulling me over time

Lost in you I won't awake
Riding for the land of dreams
Going somewhereâsomewhere in my mind
In Dreamland

Living nowhere, somewhere in my mind
Riding somewhere, going everywhere
Searching for the land of dreams (where do you live?)
... in timeless Dreamland ...
