Another battlefield, the history repeats itself
Just a dead machine, a number without a name or face
Welcome to hell again!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game

She's alone and prays to rescue my soul but now I desert
I will take my box full of hopes and letters from home
Don't move remain in hell!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game

Another battlefield, the history repeats itself
Just a dead machine, a number without a name or face
Welcome to hell again!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game
Put yourself here in my place
Life is mine I take my blames
