White - The sheet is empty as my head
I try to full them both but I'm becoming mad

Give me a starting point, a hint
As soon as possible my friends

Everyone is looking for meanings
But sometimes there is no need
Free to decide to write following our moods

Black - My ink is flowin' from my pen
I should tell ya about a lost love or dragon's tale

I found, if you have no words to say
Don't say nothing and it's ok!

Everyone is looking for meanings
But sometimes there is no need
Free to decide to write following our moods
It's an escape from what we have around
