Time is almost right
I can feel the adrenaline
I'm sure no one, no one can disturb my time

I'm so close to her
Just a step and I'll be there
I have the key to open a paradise on earth

No rules here
No fear dear
Engine is ready my heart starts shaking
Tonight I'll commit my crime oh yeah!!!

I don't know where my goal is
I run away from all the lies you told me

Now she is taking me to nowhere
This time I left behind me who I am

Hangin' on your wheel
Everything seems so unreal
Tires are screeching louder too close to the edge

No rules here
No fear dear
Six gears are ready to push me on the seat babe
Tonight I'll commit my crime oh yeah!!!

I don't know where my goal is
I run away from all the lies you told me

Now she is taking me to nowhere
This time I left behind me who I am
