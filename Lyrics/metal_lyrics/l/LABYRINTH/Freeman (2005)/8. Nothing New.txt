Trying to remember what we've lost
Now I realize
That a new life is born

A very little step ahead
And the bad tales of yesterday (are) behind
Tomorrow won't be easy but
Our shoulders now are strong enough

Nothing new under the sun
Don't look back follow your star
Past is gone open your eyes

Everyone has a path
I wanna ride on mine with an open mind
Nothing is for free here
Sometimes the strength is hard to find

Nothing new under the sun
Don't look back follow your star
Past is gone open your eyes
