Pride means never give up
And never say lies
Are you sure to be a right man, from deep down inside

Sometimes it's so easy to hide the reality just for a while
But sooner or later you know we have to face and pay

Masters of our future
Fortune is like a train that you can't catch
Masters of our fate
Put out the hate and now start again

Cry your reasons out loud
Fight for your line
Everything will be clear, under a new light

Sometimes it's so hard to find
The courage to take off the mask
But sooner or later you know we have to face and pay

Masters of our future
Fortune is like a train that you can't catch
Masters of our fate
Put out the hate and now start again
