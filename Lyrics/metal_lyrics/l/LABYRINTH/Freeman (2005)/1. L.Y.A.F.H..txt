Call my name through the noises of
This deafning silence
I will hear your voice as an angel's cry

The glow is painting a deep blue tapestry
Then I go....

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
Where I can easily hide
My real me from strangers' eyes

If you want the space is right for you and I, so
Follow me...

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
Where I can easily hide
My real me from strangers' eyes

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
I'll show you if you want
A new place for you and I
