Free - I wanna be just me.... You cannot
Out - From any race or truth.... You cannot

Thinking with someone else's brain is no use but
They want us deaf and blind.... So deaf and blind

Dive in open waters
No more chains surround your arms now
Be yourself with no compromise

Dreaming - With open eyes is nice.... You cannot
Say - no to every lie they say.... You cannot

Living with someone else's face is no use but
They need us deaf and blind.... So deaf and blind

Dive in open waters
No more chains surround your arms now
Be yourself with no compromise
