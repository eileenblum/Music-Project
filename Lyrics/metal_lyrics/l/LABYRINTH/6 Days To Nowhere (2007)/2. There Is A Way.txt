Down in the street, I feel the heat
Even if (the) night wind blows on me
There's a fever blowing out
...as a slow disease

Depending on someone's will
It's not easy to decide
If you try to ask me how I feel
...Still alive and alone

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

Before it's time to say goodbye
At the shadow of my cross
I just hope a change is gonna come
...a change for everyone

Too many flags without a sense
Everywhere you see the end
I believe there is a way
Cause it's not too late

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

There is a way
I feel it today
No! Nothing is lost!

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

Oh, there is a way
