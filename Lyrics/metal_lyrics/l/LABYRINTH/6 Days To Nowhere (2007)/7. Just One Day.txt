Leave me alone
I don't wanna play
Another part in your mess

Now I need air
And I don't care
What the world is thinking

Won't be "anyone"
Without a face
A pawn in a crazy game

It's better to live
Free just one day
Than a whole life as a slave

I'll stay away
From what medias say
I'm scared of all that screaming

Don't need your thoughts
I still follow mine
And if I fall it will be my fault
