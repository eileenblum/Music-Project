A rusty nail
Down straight into the head
Infected brains
Communication failed

Turn off the light
Put out the fire
Free your mind free your deepest side

Red is the blood
Under each kind of skin
Green is the hope
But shame has no color

Turn off the light
Put out the fire
Free your mind free your deepest side

Never look back
Life is ahead
But don't forget your way home
