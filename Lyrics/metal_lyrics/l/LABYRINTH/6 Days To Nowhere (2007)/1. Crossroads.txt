Now I'm on my way
Livin' in a state of mind
Out of time

Sun is shining high
I've been driving my car fast
Since last night

Another crossroad and another choice
Road sign tells 6 miles to nowhere

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in this reality

Maybe I am out of space
But it's better to stay away, than live today

I saw that fire that burns fed by innocent lives
I've had enough

The road is straight, I cannot see the end
But 6 miles now are almost done

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in chains

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in this reality
