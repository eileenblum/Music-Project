I'm sick
I'm mad
I'm feeling wrapped again
I breathe, but I'm still sinking

I'm done
I'm gone
I feel it in one bone
The walls around are falling

Voices are crying loud from inside (Crying loud from inside)

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

I'm dogged
I'm traced
Just wanna hide my face
I know my demons find me

You say
I'm fine
But I'm lying on the floor
The room is getting smaller

Voices are crying loud from inside (Crying loud from inside)

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

Can't you see what I feel
You don't know what it means
Livin' day by day waiting to die

To die

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes
