The twilight
Brings me hope and heat
Even if you're not here

Remember
What we've shared 'til now, it's a precious gift

Now you're far from me
Behind a curtain of smoke and dreams

I never wasted all in words
But I guess you know

Everytime you say 'love ya'
I forget my pain, no more falling rain

I can see your eyes
Behind a curtain of smoke and dreams

No matter where you are
Always in my heart

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

A little of me

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me
