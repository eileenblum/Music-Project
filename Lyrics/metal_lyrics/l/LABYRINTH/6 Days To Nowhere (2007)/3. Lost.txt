Heavy is the load..
Pushing down, on body and soul
Ready to explode
Time is ticking too slow..

The time is ticking too slow

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

There's a world out there
And I still hang my head
I would give all my life
For a while out of these walls

A while out of these walls

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

They're here for me, soon I'll be free
The hell would be easier than all this
I never prayed, don't need ya priest
My time is due, how sweet is the end..

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

I never prayed, don't need ya priest
My time is due, how sweet is the end
