Thinking of all the lies we told
...it wasn't so bad and now I know what it means
We are growing old,this is sad it's so hard to say
Those wheels are turning so much faster

Pay today all your dues without waiting for tomorrow
We need a white flag with ourselves
Do the best without rest for a better tomorrow
Don't left unspoken words again

Falling into a dark despair I can't find your smile
Why am I so blind?
The reasons of yesterday are gone

Light is so bright but I still can't see
Can someone guide me through this silent fog

Pay today all your dues without waiting (for) tomorrow
We need a white flag with ourselves
Do the best without rest for a better tomorrow
Don't left unspoken words again
