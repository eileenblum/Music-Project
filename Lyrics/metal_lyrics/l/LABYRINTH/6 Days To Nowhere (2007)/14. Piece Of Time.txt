[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

Labyrinth
Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of lucidity

Somewhere I'm waiting for a sign that shows me a direction
Let me across the Labyrinth

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
I please you don't forget

It's too late to make a change
This wasteland can feel my agony
I've heard the distance in your voice
I live and learn by my mistakes

Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of lucidity

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
I please you don't forget

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
