Here come old flat top he come, grooving up slowly he got
Joo joo eyeball he one, holy roller he got
Hair down to his knee, got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine he got, toe jam football he got
Monkey finger he shoot, coca cola he say
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together right now over me

He bag production he got, walrus gumboot he got
Ono sideboard he one, spinal cracker he got
Feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Come together right now over me

He roller coaster he got, early warning he got
Muddy water he one, mojo filter he say
One and one and one is three
Got to be good-looking cos he's so hard to see

Come together right now
Come together right now
Come together right now over me
