Across the bright light of a red sunset I saw
allthe beauty I never noticed before
Air is sweet and stroking my face as a kiss
I could never figure out a future without all this

See what we've done to mother earth No mercy, no pity we have
green and blue are turning in to black

Water is covered
by a veil of evil oil
they named it black gold

Ice is melting but ground is becoming sand
no more seasons no more spring summer or fall
exploitation will bring our lands right to the bone
what kind of future are we preparing for our sons?

See what we've done to mother earth
no mercy no pity we have
green and blue are turning in to black

Find just a reason to say "no"
or everything will soon be dead and gone lakes and seas are turning into mud
