Everyone's looking for a direction to
Follow to reach the skies on our heads

But it's not for free,what do you think to give?
There's a price you have to pay in this life.

Tears are falling from a heaven gone
...lost,cast away on island of nowhere
Tears are falling flooding around me

Men are still the same,everyone has his truth
It's not mine it's not yours...it's...what???

Slaves to the bias,ready to judge the strange
Who's watching as evil in his eyes

Tears are falling from a heaven gone
...lost,cast away on island of nowhere
Tears are falling flooding around me
