Let me introduce myself I'm your fear
Do you really know who I am?
I'll be everything you need or dream of
I'll slowly take you to the end So many times I wish I wasn't
Only a shade But at the sunset I feel somethin'
Burn inside me Slave to the night
I can hear your heartbeat while you sleepin'
Greed takes possession of me
Let me sink my teeth into your young throat
Hey don't turn you back to me now
It's so hard to live forever alone
Ther's no rest for me And no love at all
Always lookin' for somethin' I can't have
In this darkness now I'm becomin' mad
'cause I know this nite I will kill again
Now in the end I'm still lookin' for Someone to love
But than the sunset I feel somethin'
Burn inside me
