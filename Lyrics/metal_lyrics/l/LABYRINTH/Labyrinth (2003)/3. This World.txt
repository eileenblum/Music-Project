Too blind to see the truth
Too dumb to remember
What we learned from a past still so near
We forget so easily
Bad winds are blowin' on our peace
Dark wings have bought us to insanity
Is this the time to say our prayers?

Is this the time to take our blames ?
We need just as a language Whitout words or symbols
Something made of a common respect for life
