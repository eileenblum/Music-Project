Through the years good 'n' bad times we've walked
Lookin' for a dream that someone stole away
Where is the right way to get out of this maze?
Someone is lost inside it but we won't forget

Everything we had before
Seems to be so far away now there's no anger in our hearts
Just the will to make it better We are on the run again !

No pain livin' in a maze Our fate we face
Always livin' in a maze This time we won't loose the race

How many blind alleys we found along the road
But now is the time to reach the out let soon
