My soul is burning now 'cuz years ago you gave me secret sorrows
I've seen the ice through your eyes
How could you've been untrue nice sad and hollow
Bad things crawl inside my heart To live is hard now and
I' getting son mad Blood will flow please life return
Oh I don't if winds still blow
And where I will heal my wounds
But you'll give me warmth again 
When I'll get home Or when I will fly far
Crazyness start to creep
Day by day my rage seems to be hallowed
But I will fly so high
And from now on shout
Should be in your honour
Bad things crawl deep inside my heart
To live is hard now and
I'm getting so mad
Blood will flow please life return
