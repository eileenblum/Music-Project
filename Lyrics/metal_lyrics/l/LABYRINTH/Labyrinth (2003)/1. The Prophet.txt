It was a nite dark 'n' cold
Same old situation on the streets
No one was thinkin' 'bout what should become
When a strange man started to say
Sinners you are you've got no shame for
The evil you've done Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our souls
Cries in downtown The Ground is shakin'
End is near blindin' fear Cries in downtown
No way to run Thy will is done
Eyes full of dread 'roundthat man
The prophet continued his warning
But in between blades of fire From the clouds
Burn everything that he said
Sinners you are now you will pay for The evil you've done
Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our soul
