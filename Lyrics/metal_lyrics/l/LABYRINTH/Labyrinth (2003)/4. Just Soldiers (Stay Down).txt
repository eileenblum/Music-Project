Sound of pipes war's all around I'm creepin' on the ground
I wonder why I do this Stay down and load your gun
I don't know if it's worth while I'm near the fighting line
The breath of death is close to me
No way to avoid all this madness around here
Oh my god please tell me what is right
What is the price?
Glory fame and pride
No! I won't obey
Then you'll have to die
The soil is red of our blood
I'm sinkin' in the mud
A sinner voice is saying: Stay down and play your game
Now I'm facing the enemy
But hey, he's the same as me
A man who fights for someone's fault
