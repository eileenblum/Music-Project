My mind is clear as the sky, For the first time
I can see what I left behind my shoulders
I don't care if the world keeps on turning
I'll be strong if you stay here by my side
and walkin' hand in hand again
we live our life with just a smile
No words to explain what love can realize
Fragile like a flower and stronger than a storm
Goodbye sun welcome moon my old friend
How I dreamed how I cried under your eyes
I don't care if the rain keeps on falling
I'll be there to repair your every time
No words to explain what love can realize
Fragile like a flower and stronger than a storm
No more dark hours into my heart 
You color my days and that is all I want
