No more ways to hide your face
In a corner you are friend
Please don't give me your claim and lie
Look at me straight in the eys
But tell me where is the fun
You're alone now
How can you waste all your life
You're deep in trouble man
If you wanna stop your bllody mess
Run by our side
The you will live a real world of dream 
Rise your voice 'n' sing with me
Your synthetic paradise
It's the illusion of a moment
It's easyer tha to fight to survive
You won't keep yourself alive
