I'm not the same
a warrior soul that burns away for love
I'm in a haze but there's a light, riding from her face

Maybe it could be love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...

Something inside:
a strange feel I never had in all my life...
I understand:
Kathryn, you know your stare, just take my breath away

Now I know it's love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...

Now I know it's love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...
... I've left my old life behind...
