What happened? I can't stand it...
I don't like this feeling...
I'm Louis, the ruler,
I always get what I want!

And I need her love.
Now, before it's too late...
Yes, I need that girl,
oh, Kathrin, now I just need you
much more than the air...

Kathryn...
You'll be mine tomorrow.
Kathryn,
passion made me blind!
Kathryn,
I will stop my sorrow
Kathryn,
when you will be mine...

My heart beats for those eyes:
They've raped my soul...
Don't tell me what is right,
kings have no fault.

I need her lips,
Till then I'll have no peace.
Lost in your image
oh, Kathryn days that will follow
will not be the same...

Kathryn...
You'll be mine tomorrow.
Kathryn,
passion made me blind!
Kathryn,
I will stop my sorrow
Kathryn,
when you will be mine...
