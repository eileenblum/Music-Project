Ready to leave for the pride of my King,
ready to sin for his love,
what a strange world, where a kingdom may fall
for a "caprice" of a lord...

In my hall, there's a reek of sin that flows...
lost in the darkness I can feel Your presence,
my shame won't be cleansed anymore...

Save me, oh my God!
'cause I've got to sell my soul,
won't You save me once again?
Won't You hear my silent pray?

Slave to a portrait, the king fell in love:
"bring me that girl", his final words...
Should ever a poor man, as I really am
live by his faith, or obedience...?

In my hall, there's a reek of sin that flows...
lost in the darkness I can feel Your presence,
my shame won't be cleansed anymore...

Save me, oh my God!
'cause I've got to sell my soul,
won't You save me once again?
Won't You hear my silent pray?
