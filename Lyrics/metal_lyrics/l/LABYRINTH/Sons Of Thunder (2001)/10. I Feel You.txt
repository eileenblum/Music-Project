My old words and new dreams
Without taste or ideas
And your eyes make me scream
And my fear disappears

Oh, there is
No true love, oh

I feel you
Soft music is moving so lightly
A world that's exploading inside me

I feel you
Emotion is coming so brightly
Your heartbeat is pounding around me

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami...

A sweet memory of you
And a song on the way
And the shadows of truth
Are flying away

Oh, there is
No true love, oh

I feel you
A beautiful lonely old statue
Don't leave me, you need me, come closer

I feel you
Lost island somewhere in the ocean
Two lovers are playing their first game

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

I feel you
Strange visions are changing the desert
A wind full of dust wants to blind me

I feel you
A taste of the wild love inside me
I'm dying to meet you

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

I feel you
I'm dying to meet you
