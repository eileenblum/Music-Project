Sounds like someone called my name...
Then, you see, I'm here...
Strange it is to find myself
in this noble place.

Sure I kneel to the king of kings
and I'll swear my loyalty

Everything you may need
(and every word you say)
just put your faith on me...

Remember our name,
it comes from inside,
stronger than all we are
sons of thunder!

Hidden in the shade we creep,
deadly as a silent blade

We are wherever
(everywhere you go)
disguised in the night...

Remember our name,
it comes from inside,
stronger than all we are
sons of thunder!
