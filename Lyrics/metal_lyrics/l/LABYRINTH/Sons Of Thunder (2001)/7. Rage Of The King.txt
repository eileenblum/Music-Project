So, is this the end?
Well, I won't forget...
Time will give me a chance
to get my revenge.

Oh no, in the heart of kings
there's no place for love.
Oh, Kathryn, won't you take my heart?
Then I'll love no one...

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage of the king!

No, there is no escape
from the hate I feel...
Blood! That's what I need,
blood... So sweet to me...

Oh no, in the heart of kings
there's no place for love.
Kathryn, won't you come to me?
... Why you left me alone... ?

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage of the king!

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage
