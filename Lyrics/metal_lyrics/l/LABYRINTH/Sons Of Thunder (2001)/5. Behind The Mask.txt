No, please don't cry
don't waste all your tears on this.
'cause that is life,
a destiny tough to change.

The only way to escape
from reality lives in our dreams...

No, little girl
I'm sorry but that's not a dream
don't start beggin' me:
I'm not the reason of your tears

What do you think of me?
I'm not as cruel as you may think...

Now look at me,
tell me now: what do you see?
Oh, behind the mask
there's a man who used to cry.

Now come with me
it's too late, no turning back!
Few days and a king
is going to pretend your hand...

And I'll take care of you:
they paid for this. Don't blame me.

Now look at me,
tell me now: what do you see?
Oh, behind the mask
there's a man who used to cry.
