So finally here we are,
I'm walking on her path.
Soon my shade will melt with the night,
setting up my trap.

And like on a spider's web
you'll get trapped by me!

Oh, no. Please don't be afraid,
I'll surely take care of you...

We are victims or hunters,
this is our life (just our life... )
and with a face like yours,
you are the nicest prize...

Once I asked to myself
how far I went for his lust,
but your finest features
really pay me off.

You've been my challenge,
but now I will set your free.

We are victims or hunters,
this is our life (just our life... )
and with a face like yours,
you are the nicest prize...
