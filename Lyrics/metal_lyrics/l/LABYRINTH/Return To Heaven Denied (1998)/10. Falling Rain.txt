[SOLO: RAIN]

Deep in my heart
I would like to find a place for love
... It's not so easy as i'd like ...
and all this time, all the time we've lost
Just to follow a dream
... nothing will remain ...

The rain is falling down on me
falling down as a silent cry

Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my heart
I can't find my inner soul
Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

It's not your way and I think you gotta find one
... a little Angel starts to cry ...
This falling rain is telling now a love is dying
... but i will live into your heart ...

The rain is falling ...

Now I'm staring ...

Deep in my heart
I would like to find a place for love
and all this time, all the time we've lost
Just to follow a dreams ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÃRSEN]

Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my heart
I can't find my inner soul
Now I'm staring at mirror and all around
nothing but falling rain ...
