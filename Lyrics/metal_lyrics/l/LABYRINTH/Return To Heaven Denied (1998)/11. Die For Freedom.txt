I hear their voices calling
I feel their eyes watching me

Nothing but few words to say
Mercy's not the one I'll pray
I won't be their slave ... no more ...

Tonight we'll pay out lust for freedom
d'you see my eyes?
They're bold and proud 'cause I don't fear the price

Die for freedom - that's the price we will pay
Die for freedom - am I dying in vain?
We faced the Masters (higher of Sins)
Die for freedom

My dreams are falling down
now I understand what it means ...

Masters call, I have to go
should I follow what they said?
Tell me now: is there a reason why?

Tonight we'll pay out lust for freedom
d'you see my eyes?
They're bold and proud 'cause I don't fear the price

Die for freedom - that's the price we will pay
Die for freedom - am I dying in vain?
We faced the Masters (higher of Sins)
Die for freedom

[SOLO: BREEZE/RAIN/THÃRSEN]

Tonight we'll pay our lust for freedom ...
Die for freedom
