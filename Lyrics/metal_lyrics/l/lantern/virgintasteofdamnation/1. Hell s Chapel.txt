From the altar to life they come
From the vaults of the house of nuns
Living dead in the service of Yule
Empty sockets but staring at you
You seek salvation from the bottom of collection
But the coin merely clanks on the floor
No Christ, only orgies in his stead
Only doom, itâs the day of the dead

At hells chapel, a mass is on
For death and beyond
Nightmares in the church
Out of life, out of god, 666 kill

Once every year, the dead will seek revenge
On the joyousness of living, a thirst now theirs to quench

Come to me...

Walking across the pews soaked in blood
The devilâs work in the house of god
The sermon's on but no words to be said
The verses echo reversed within your head
Only froth in the stead of the wine
Only faeces for sacramental bread
Down your chin they now morbidly spread
On your bones now freed from your flesh
