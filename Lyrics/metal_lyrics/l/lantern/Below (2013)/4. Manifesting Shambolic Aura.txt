have lain growing my force for one last search
Come one with inner demons, given death birth
And my back I shanât turn
Thrust beyond and make return
Manifesting his auraâ¦

Gliding this cortex I see the dream I choose
My body a mere vessel carrying you through

A clear foresight of a plague and a cure
A glimpse of true light reflecting from the impure

Ave Satan, my lantern in the dark
Through this offer, may our views become one

The unlight meditation shall bear its fruit
Preparing soulless coffins to unfold their truth
Weltering in putrefaction the faceless come born
Devouring nightmares bred deep into your souls

A glimpse of true light, the knives of my mind
With violence I strike, standing tall in your blood

Hear the bells of your doom declare my tide
For an hour of bright calamity
This is the wake of the black seed
The foul incubation complete

The release of the fume of the coffins
The release of the faceless of the deep
The gods which dwell within my church
The chaos in order emerged
Ave Satan...
