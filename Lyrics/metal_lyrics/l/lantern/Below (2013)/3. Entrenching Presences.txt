Unholy deeds performed in secrecy
Lay haunting the eve like the reminiscence of the late
And when the clouds meander and take forms unlike seen
Something stirs in the ether, a presence... 
Entrenching

Soar... Through the abyss, whence the concealed wisdoms are welling forth
Like souls dwelt in malice lay hungry for my stifled thoughts
The visions in the shadows, in the darkest recess of the mind
Which crawl yet to shatter what I once defined as my one true life

Behold... Apparitions, unimaginable dreams of space
From a closed division of my psyche something escalates:
Revelations... From beyond; reborn in gnosis of starlight
And the more I know, the more my bonds to this world dissolve

The order in which stars align, clarified
Archaic times and nameless rites I have come to remember;
Taken by a presence old and repugnant

Torn out from where my roots lie
And my mind altered by alchemy beyond all that is human:
"Solve et coagula!" 
Dissolve to evolve

Feels like I am crawling with serpent-forms, feelers, tongues;
This hour one with forgotten ages

Entrenched in abhorrence you dare not to believe

Impregnated by a seed of higher planes
Presences spawning in my soul:
Now I have seen all in a larger scale
Larger than my mind could hold

How deep in depths must I linger on?
How far in merciless, cold space
Until man I am no more?

When the dawn breaks, and the hoar falls to dew
And with the dew leaves my presence, into death's silver hue
How the clouds meander and take forms unlike seen
The last pale remainder of what ever lingers of me

The order in which stars align...
