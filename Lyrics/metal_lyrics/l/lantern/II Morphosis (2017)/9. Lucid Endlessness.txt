Dark matter from timeless streams
This flux of souls redeemed 
Through black holes woven 
In between the wake and the dream
Amorphous in silver seas
Coalescent in surreal
Like mercury, my essence slowly dispersing

Here I gaze upon the deep, enormous outer reach
Whence projected lay demons born within
Here I face my suffering; 
My fears, my mortal grief
My prospects, hopes and dreams;
All drowned as callously

Deep down in the seething, hoary depths
The lips of the orifice of rebirth 
Disgustingly they throb

Watching terrors, one by one
Emerge in raw and unimpeded violence 
With the rage of suns
Succumbing to the bane to come;
In fragments nowhere-bound
I linger on in halls of stained vermillion

I join as one with nightmares old as stars of Scorpius
My being but a torch in the strange horizon
Debris caught in a cyclone: nothing I am, no more
No walls remain to seal the endless cold

Deprived of the "I" 
In a mercurial insight
Of this cosmic womb, of all times
Of worlds designed to die

On through the cold view
The silver endlessness
Nothing... nowhere
As in a dream
Reaching for death

...A sombre descent lies ahead
The outer reach brooding like a tumour over me
And with the ardour of a snake hunting for prey
The salivating orifice lay lusting to swallow my being

The struggles vain:
The aspirations for a higher entity
Now slipping out of reach
Into bowels of flesh
Disintegrated by the reek
The acidity of the earthly decree
In a storm of carnal need
The true crown withers away

Fleeting... seething...
The impregnation of the soul
Into measurable forms 
Of mortal existence

Sleeping... breathing... 
The parasitic embryo
Shaping in the foetal mould
Gathering its strength
For eating through
The vaginal phlegm 
To be reborn
