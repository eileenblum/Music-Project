Beneath the coffin's lid
Within the skull
Trapped in the ribcage
Coursing in-scapula
In worm-eaten sockets 
And maggot-gnawed fingertips
In the dirt under toenails
An essence still perseveres

Face death and taste the fear;
Just rot to feel and rot to hear

The labyrinth of veins
The walls of your lungs
Your loin once so fruitful
Your muscles and cerebra
The fractured membranes
The chamber in your heart's stead
This whole collapsing temple
By myriad fungi devoured

And faster than you drift on
The foul yellow plague takes hold of you
