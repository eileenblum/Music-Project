A simple picture - people mourning
At the grave of a recently lost one
I laughed, they cried
Obscure clouds applied to the sky
While outside in the fall night
Past the funeral - the glimpse of a black cat
The same mist now fast applied
Someone late came to life

The funeral was over and I had to admit
That more than sorrow in the air to rid
The presence of madness and the coldness of death
In my head like the reapers laurel leaf wreath

Thereâs only fear and darkness to devour
The underworld - transmigration

Nightmares arrive and wonât go by
Sleep wonât divide my day from my night
In my broken mind death may die
Thereâs no light

In my room a dark cloud swallows the light
In my stead just two eyes with but darkness in sight
In my arms a passed love - a grave for my bed
In my head the voices of the spirit of the dead

Thereâs only fear and darkness to devour - the underworld

Nightmares arrive and wonât go by
Sleep wonât divide my day from my night
In my broken mind death may die
Thereâs no light

In my mind, even death may die
In the light of the underworld...
