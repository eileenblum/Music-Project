"Follow me into the flames
Take leave of your eroding remains
And out from this bodily masquerade"

"Out from this cold
Staleness and warmth
...Into the void
Into the astral embrace
The end of your strains;
The shadowless plane awaits

"So come forth, my servant: 
Let us hereby commence 
The cleansing of the air!"

Meanwhile in its mold, the flesh lies still
Coldly waiting for its weight to descend in the deep
Yet further in the waste behind those eyes
The fragments seek, like moths seek flames
To immaterialize... and shatter away 

In a requiem of pale voices
A funerary anointment for the deceased
A ceremony foregone within
To disband of earthly chains

Across thresholds black, in effulgent halos' glare
As an invitation back into the fleshless herd
Disguised in muted voices, in otherworldly prayers
The redeemer sounds the bell to sanctify the air
...Upon the death of form diffusing into the state of nonbeing

"Embrace me, o son of sacred spirit
Embrace me like a vial must embrace the weight of wine
And observe as we degenerate the altar
Set fire to the mercurial veils between all times

Thirsty and unfeeling, my coven lies
We shall strike down and lacerate with ever-hungry knives
Drink the blood of the heart, gouge out the eyes
And separate the limbs, for now thou must stand and rise
In death undying, to face and receive the divine"

In the cleansing of the air 
Dissolution absolute
Exorcism of the shape 
The carcass thriving 
With the strangest of fruit

...Thus sounds the bell its solemn tone
As one embarks for home
