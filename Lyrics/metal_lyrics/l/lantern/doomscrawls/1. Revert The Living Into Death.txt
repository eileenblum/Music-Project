Through lids of coffins, through astral seas
Spiralled and ossified deathâs horns arise

A corpse clothed in linen as white as the bone beneath the skin
A remnant of oneâs time usurped as given scattered by a gust of unearthly winds

Existence - molten faceless mass
Swarming with serpents and foul rats
Come to cleanse - a calling voice of glass
Falling like a light from elder times

Again, caught in a secret glance beyond where effulgence sways
Salvage the remains from this fate: to be convicted in shackles of veins

Await; the mortal will shall break
Open the gateways to depths
Rivers of vital fluids gush: I exhale my epitaph said:

Revert the living into death
One by one â closing in the aspects of life
The illusions once measured with time shall die

The ecstasy of death
The sensation of nothingness reigns
Come, take me â to what ever lies ahead after death

Can you hear the echo from the depths?
The master compiles the scattered
The master asks you of your flesh
The circle closes, receive death

Follow, children, into deathâ¦
