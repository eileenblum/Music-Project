Ritualâ¦

Midnight secludes the graveyard
A shovel to consume the ground
A peek beyond to tear down
The balance of done and left undone

Upheaval of lifeâ¦ The scent of foul flesh
Itâs not how you figured
The source of true nature
Indistinct mess â sockets of gore scaling you

Unholy ways - the feel of this place
You welter in your shallow scare:
The candles are lit - fresh prints in the grit â
Someone was already there

Ritual unearthing of false spiritual enquiries beckons
Silence and coldâ¦ The shadows to chase:
Your soul takes leave, madness remains

So keen you follow the marks in the soil
Your mind journeys beyondâ¦

The shades of dead trees
Drawing you deeper into the mist
But you couldnât see, you couldnât feel:
Your shoulders in dead fingersâ grip

The ritual ends
A casket impends to seal your life down underground
Youâre one with the damned, lowered in land:
Listen to the shovelling soundâ¦

Ritualâ¦
Call for darknessâ¦ and it will storm
Pray for evilâ¦ and it will stir
Speak to darknessâ¦ and your words dissolve
Whisper into emptinessâ¦ and death will answer
Ritualâ¦
