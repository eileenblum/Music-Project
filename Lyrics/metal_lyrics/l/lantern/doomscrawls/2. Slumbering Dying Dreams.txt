Awake yet in a dream
Wading through a thousand miles of demise
Where illusions come to reveal
The truth that used to brace strong minds, all lies

Indiscreet, yet in this evidence, the only truth
The weight of your visions - in due course - brings suffocation

For when all the structures break, the surface will shatter and wake
The view down beneath, the reality of our fate
I've explored before it's too late
To come into knowledge that death is all that surrounds
The rotting waiting for a chance to devour

My subconscious wanders, already I know, beyond sane return

You'll never come to understand me
Decay dwelling in man is what my fingers feel
... doom-scrawls and drowning screams

Beyond the shambles of man slumber the dreams of the damned
That dance in your mind, screeching cursed cries
Scavenging hope to survive
The shadows defined by the fire, burn in your eyes forever
Incubating the visions so foul...
That refuse to slumber Even when the flesh sleeps underground

Thus awaken the nether dreams
Confront burning torture of the soul
Here your human eyes shall see the roaring pits too ashen to behold
Here your blood, your hellborn wings come infested by the embryonic spawn of demons

You're never whole again
You slip away from the conscious
Born-again past humanity
Blind ones - you're never to be woken to see
That you're too far away in the darkness
Slumbering dying dreams

You'll never come to understand these
Mind-ripping dreams that drag you to the deceased
... doom-scrawls and drowning screams

So youâve found your very place in the unknown
So you drown in the dark side of the human soul
In swaying forms, out of life yet still in motion
How beautiful: here emptiness shall devour all

Beyond the shambles of life
Thereâs nothing and no one to abide
The visions of âlive deceased, the profundity of the seas
The structures too weak for their weight
The truth itâs already late to flee from the rotting
The void that will ever attempt to consume
Your truthful essence: worthless toil, the monoliths of man
Those drag us all below to slumber dying dreams
