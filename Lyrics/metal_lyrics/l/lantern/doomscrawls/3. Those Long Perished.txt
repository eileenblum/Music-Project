Deep shadows entrenched in here
With wings to soar the chasms
Whispers lay beckoning
A secret meeting in the cleft of grasp

The miasmal presence of the unknown summons me
Towards my fear in an extent no words can tell
Where the holy sleep their dreams
Torn by evilâ¦

Enticed by the stagnant air I share with ancient lungs
The innate scent of death floating like a word of lifeless tongues

Here I smell, my hands can feel
The winds beyond all life;
Fabric that is caught between two worlds
The virtues of the old torn by evil

Onward, I canât resist
The voices stuck in the apertures
Chanting on their spells â¦
The incantations of wordless screams in quiescence
Chanting on: âEmbrace the one with horns and cloven hoovesâ

Moonlight shifts shades through the rooms
The illusion of light unveils proof
In silence one sound speaks out doom
A secret unfolds an age too soon

Come forth horrors - the ancient kin
Raped by time - torn by evil
Come forth, ones long perished
Rule over my world with your voices torn
Torn by evilâ¦

Here I am, in your shades awake
In darkness, with knees too frail
In darkness, one world will fade
Another torn by the late 

Here I see, ny hands can feel
Winds beyond mortal storms
On which the mighty horns
Release me entirely out from this fleeting world
