He comes to those who wait
And to those who close their eyes
Kindly stops for each one of us
Everybody's dying all the time
So don't resist the stroke of death
Don't be afraid, you'll live until you die

He will take you home
In the flesh, my child
Sing your swan song
Stealing you from your lovers arms
Harvesting you, to crown your life

He comes to those who wait
And to those who close their eyes
The reaper comes for each one of us
Everybody's dying all the time
So don't resist the stroke of death
Don't be afraid, you'll live until you die
Until you die

He will take you home
In the flesh, my child
Sing your swan song
Stealing you from your lovers arms
Harvesting you beneath his wings

See the stars and sun, see how they shine
Oh for you never know when it is your last time

Oh darling, my darling
Oh darling, but my darling
Don't you fool yourself
The world is a temple of the dying

The dying...
