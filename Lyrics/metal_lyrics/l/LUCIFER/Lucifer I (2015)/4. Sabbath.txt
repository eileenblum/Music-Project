Take me to the sabbath
Take me to church
To the holy shrine of our holy words
Come as my magus
I'll be your priestess
I light the candle
And it burns
For you
I live
Sacrifice myself to you

I will never vow
I will never kneel
I will never worship
I will never pray
To another

Take me to the sabbath
Take me to church
To the holy shrine of our holy words
Come as my magus
I'll be your priestess
I light the candle
And it burns
For you
I live
Sacrifice myself to you

I will never vow
I will never kneel
I will never worship
I will never pray
To another

In this house of magic
The flame is burning high
In the chapel of our love
Burning til I die
