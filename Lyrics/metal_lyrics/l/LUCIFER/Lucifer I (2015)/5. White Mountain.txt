If all the stars should tumble and fall
And the skies are sinking down below
If the misty white mountains should crumble and fall
And the stillness of night is all we ever know

Crystal cold is the night
We're taking it slow
Pale are the mountains
Shrouded in snow

Deep dark water
Our shadows...
Deep dark water
Our shadows are mirrored in you

Slate grey is the sky
We're taking it slow
Heavy the snow falls
To the valley below

Deep dark water
Our shadows...
Deep dark water
Our shadows are mirrored in you

If all the stars above should tumble and fall
And the sky above is sinking down below
If the misty white mountains should crumble and fall
If the stillness of night is all we will ever know

Like hunters on silent feet
Down unknown roads
Into the wilderness we go

Deep dark water
Our shadows...
Deep dark water
Our shadows are mirrored in you
