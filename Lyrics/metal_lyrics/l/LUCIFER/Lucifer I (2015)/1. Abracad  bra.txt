Seven is the omen
Seven by the three
Seventh number magic
Above reality

Some might say that I
Worship the Devil
He's been knocking on my door
And I let him in

Abracadabra
Say the magic word
Abracadabra
Cast your spell

Seven, seven ritual
Seven is my name
Abraxas, number magic
It's a wondrous game

Magic white and magic black
A hocus pocus world
There is no turning back
When you chose to speak the world

Abracadabra
Say the magic word
Abracadabra
Cast your spell

The witches, wizards, magicians
Play a very ancient game
Gathered for the ritual
All came to chant his name
The witches, wizards, magicians
Play a very ancient game
Gathered for the ritual

Seven is the omen
Seven by the three
Seventh number magic
Above reality

Some might say that I
Worship the Devil
He's been knocking on my door
And I let him in

Abracadabra
Say the magic word
Abracadabra
Cast your spell
