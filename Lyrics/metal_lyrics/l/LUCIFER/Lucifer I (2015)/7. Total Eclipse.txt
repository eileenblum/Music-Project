I am the night
I lay my veil
A looming shadow
Horizon wide

The bleak stars shine
A cold and eerie light
They are born like you
Born to die

Come your dream
Come your nightmare
I fall upon you
Swallow all that shines

The bleak stars shine
A cold and eerie light
They are born like you
Born to die

Come your dream
Come your nightmare
I fall upon you
Swallow all that shines

I am the night
I lay my veil
A looming shadow
Horizon wide

The sun is rising
The moon is full
It's a black moon rising
To a total eclipse
When the planets are shifting
Your life like a tide
When mercury's in retrograde
I am your dark side

Sunlight - How did you leave me
Darkness - I'm the shadow of a total eclipse

When the sun is rising
And the moon is full
It's a black moon rising
To a total eclipse
When the planets are shifting
Your life like a tide
When mercury's in retrograde
I am your dark side

Children
Dust of the universe
Children
In the shadow of the total eclipse
