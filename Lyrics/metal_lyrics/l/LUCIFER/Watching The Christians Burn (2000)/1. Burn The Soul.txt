Burned alive,dead on the stake
condemned souls are mine to take
brimestone smell,the stench of hell
the horror burns in their eyes
the corpse burning in their mind
save your prayers for those who care
burn the soul in hell

burn the soul theres no escape
tormented soul are mine to take
they sinned in life,now there dead
burning there souls never ends

chistianity once more fails
the christians bastards burn in hell
remains decaryed now you learn
in hell your soul forever burns

drowend in a lake of fire
christ is dead the cocksucking liar
burning souls feel the fire
burn your soul no escape
tormented soul were mine to take
feel the pain of burning souls in hell's flames

blackened gates found here
burning the soul's of christian queers
two face christians soon will learn
in hell their souls will forever burn
stolen there souls,taken away
there body's lie in decay 
burning their souls in hell there souls
forever burn

stolen their soul's taken away
thier body's lie in decay
burning the soul's in hell
burning soul's are what you smell
feel the flames
