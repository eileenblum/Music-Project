begotten christian bastards their death sentence written
evil stares thru my eyes all thats evil survies
taken their lives jesuc christ been sodomized
begging for mercy no repreve the midnight hour on hollow's eve
i'm laghing they cry watching them die wittness god's demise

god's word are lies,filed with deseat,making you kill 
for religous belief's 

enter my life dark one,the anti-christ satans son
piss on the cross darkness,my soul lost in the abyss

preach the gospel sunday,cullingus with a prostitute monday
power over the weak to make pray
went to church caus they say
weakling fool's i've got the new's
it's to late he'll never rise again

weakling minds they are blind,weakling minds destine to die
weakling minds no repreve,weakling minds wipe out their disease
christian mind's will never rise
