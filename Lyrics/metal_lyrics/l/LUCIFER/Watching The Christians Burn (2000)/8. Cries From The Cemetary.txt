crying out from the grave,her murdered soul enslaved
voices from the grave,forever haunting me beging reanimation
powers of darkness encircle her grave as she rose from the coffin

the sound of her voice from the grave calls to me
releasing the undead (wipe out christ disease)

black magic working evil spells cast

rise forward from the grave,you will rise
evil in her eye's blasphemy church of christ
never to die satan survives

rising again power in satan's name
christian killing whore from the grave
christian death is what she craves
taste the sin's of human kind
the blood it flows so divine
your soul is mine
