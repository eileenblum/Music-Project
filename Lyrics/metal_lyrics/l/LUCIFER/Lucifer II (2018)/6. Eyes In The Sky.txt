By the foot of the mountain
I washed my hands out in the blue lands
I think you understand

Life has ways sometimes
You just don't know
Whether to stay
Or just to go

A myriad of stars
The eyes in the sky upon you
A timeless gaze
Ever outliving your days

Got the beast by the horns
But my heart's a morgue
Not asking for redemption
Just wish I wasn't born
Need an army of angels
To save my soul
Deliver me
I think I'm losing control

You're a giant oh mount black
But I've never seen you so sad
Heavy head in your hands
