Who will come to save your soul
Will you see the light

Pharaoh of death and scorn
Bones of dust and robes long torn
Choked on his heart of stone
He's dead

Morbid flesh, black caves for eyes
Poison snakes right by his side
The pharaoh is dead

Paranoia and decay
On his grave I dance, I'm dressed in red

Lying on his bed of death
Long exhaled is his last breath
The pharaoh is dead
Paranoia and decay
On his grave I dance, I'm dressed in red

All your shrouds they couldn't hide
You're a master of despise oh yeah
Three thousand years ago you've died
A simple man with rotten pride oh yeah
Stone coffin's where you hide
A necropolis of lies

Paranoia and decay
On his grave I dance, I'm dressed in red
Down below in his decay and paranoia
On his grave I dance, I'm dressed in red
