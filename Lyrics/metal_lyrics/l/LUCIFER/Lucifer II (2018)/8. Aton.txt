When you're down and your spirit is broken
You're in the wild and on your own
A heavy storm on the horizon

Rain and thunder in your heart
Churning waters and the rain
Keeps pouring down

Sunshine ignite
Sunshine stay a while

When you're down and the living ain't easy
Giving up when the hour is dark

Sail your ship across churning waters
When you're drowning in the flood
When you are coming down

Sunshine, ignite
Sunshine, stay a while
Sunshine, ignite

Bathe me in your spectrum of light

Pour your light on me, Aton

Sunshine, ignite
Sunshine, stay a while
Sunshine, ignite

Pale sun rise, make me alright
