There once was a lady
Of dust and gold
Lost faith and all her money
But mostly her hold

Had travelled a long way
Down a thousand roads
But what she had found
Is better untold

In the dark, all alone
Who do you call on
But a heart filled with foolish hope
Is better than none

There once was a lady
Coming in from the cold
Her days now so shadowed
And lost all her hope

Be still now my lady
For you don't know
No treasures are lost, you know
You better behold

In the dark, all alone
Who do you call on
But a heart filled with foolish hope
Is better than none

My lady don't cry now
For you don't know
Tomorrow awaits you
A heart of gold
