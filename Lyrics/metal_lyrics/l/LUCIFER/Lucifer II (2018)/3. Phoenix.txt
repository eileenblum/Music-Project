You, what are you trying to do
You, all lost and torn and blue
Regardless of them breaking all the rules
Fool, what does it take you to come through

The world is yours, don't hide below
Don't you know, you'll reap just what you sow
You gotta stand up to your fire

You, you weren't singing
Yeah you, you can't sing when your crying

The world is yours, don't hide below
Don't you know, you'll reap just what you sow
You gotta stand up to your fire

You've got the universe
Inside of you, the stars

The world is yours, don't hide below
You gotta step out from the shadow
You gotta stand up to your fire

No more swan song, nightingale
Burnt those bridges, walked away
Heart's a feather on the scale
Mercury's a-comin' your way
