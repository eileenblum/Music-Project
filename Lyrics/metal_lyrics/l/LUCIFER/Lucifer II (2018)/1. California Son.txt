Son of the morning
Hold your head up high
Spread your wings like an eagle
You're your mother's child

You got your motor running
Speeding faster than light
And there's no denying
You're born to be wild

Set your soul among the stars today
You're a warrior child
You're just an ocean away

Sitting with Ra by your side
In the California sun
Your spirits are so high
You've only just begun

Among stars you ride
To ride free you were born
On highway number one
You're a rider on the storm
