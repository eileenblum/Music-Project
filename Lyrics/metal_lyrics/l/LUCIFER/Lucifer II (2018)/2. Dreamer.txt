In the dawn comes the sun
Open your eyes
Morning comes unbegun
Like the first sunrise

Dreamer
What have you done with your life
Dreamer
Have you come to realize

You gave it all with no return
It's just another lesson learned
Go walk on, all yesterdays are gone

Dreamer, have you seen her
On a white horse tall with pride
Eyes turned to the sky

In the dream comes the sun
Open your eyes
Morning comes unbegun
Like the first sunrise

Dreamer
What have you done with your life
Dreamer
Have you come to realize

You gave it all with no return
It's just another lesson learned
Hold on to your dreams, it's a new dawn

Dreamer, have you seen her
On a white horse tall with pride
Eyes turned to the sky

In the dawn comes the sun
Open your eyes
Morning comes unbegun
Like the first sunrise
Morning sun comes along
Shining a new light
The night is gone for so long
Leave it all behind
