Have you ever seen the light
On a lonely summer day drifting off
Walking by the old stones in the yard
Contemplating when your number is up

When you used up all your time
And the flame in you is gone
When your skin has turned to white

Whatever happened to the ghosts of this town
All the bones laid down to rest down below
When the bleak man comes around
Find a quiet spot to rest
Lay all your sorrow down

When you used up all your time
And the flame in you is forlorn
When your skin has turned to white
And your summers they're all gone

Turn to dust
All the young ones keep on yearning
Turn to dust
The world it keeps on turning
