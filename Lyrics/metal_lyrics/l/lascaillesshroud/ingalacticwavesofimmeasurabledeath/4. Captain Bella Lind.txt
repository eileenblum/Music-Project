From the weight of her past
She can hear them whisper
In the thick veils, shrouded
In total darkness

Haven't you failed?
Why do you persist?

Isolated in the years of the iron sky
The echoes of time immortal
Slowly eating reality

You have failed!
You must not persist!
You will fail!
You can not persist!

A billion years from their star
Locked inside a time slipstream
The last remnants of the humans
Stand on the cosmic precipice
Eternity remains uncertain
And reality begins to slip away
Trapped inside a shell of herself
Just a step too close to the abyss

She will face the dark
Challenge the demons of the void
Stare into blinding absence
And tread forward with vigilance

I cannot allow myself to die
Even if its the only thing I want

Pioneering the last frontier
Touching a truly alien mind
Knowing what cannot be known
And never buckling beneath its weight

Captain Bella Lind
The benefactor of time

Captain Bella Lind
Alone at the end of time

As the future became
Eerily all too calm
The darkness would return
Unknown forces would strive to see
Our demise for their own needs
But I am too fucking stubborn to die

Faced with extinction
Yet again
The captain
Will she prevail?

The loss of their world
Yet again
The humans
Would they prevail?

Captain Bella Lind
The benefactor of time

Captain Bella Lind
Alone at the end of time
