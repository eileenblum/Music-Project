I stand in awe at the might of Earth 
Immense structures adorn her 
My life and love lies here 
Yet never can I return 

Never will I know your green again? 
Never can I return to you? 
Never will I bathe in your seas? 
Never can I breathe your air? 

Every night I beg for this 
To return to our home 
Every day I cry for this 
What have we done to you? 

Barren wastes 'neath my boots 
Dusty wind against the sky 
Cracked view from the gas mask 
I can finally see my Earth 

A thousand shades of a lifeless hue 
Oceans dried and forests gone 
Murder the mountains and rape the sky 
To make way for the acid rain 

A thousand shades of a lifeless hue 
Oceans dried and forests burned 
Murder the mountains mutilate the sky 
To make way for your doomsday 

My life and my love lies here 
Yet never can I return
