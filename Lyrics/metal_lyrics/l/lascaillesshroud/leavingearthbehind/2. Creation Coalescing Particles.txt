Elements thrive in a maelstrom of mass 
Condensing existence to a single point 
Infinitely dense no laws can be applied 
Everything is nothing, and nothing is all 

A burning sphere infantile star 
A citadel of ice froze upon foreign shores 
A transmigration of galaxies 
A universe dead folds upon itself 

Inside a structure spanning further than light 
Have I become a monster, or am I still man? 
Questions like a poison infest the mind 
At the end of this road is there even redemption? 

Super symmetrical dimension compress 
The dreamlike view below the river of time 
Matter and mass now mine to control 
Cosmic strings to weave a grand design 

A thunderous roar inside the great halls 
Echoes throughout the essence of being 
Sparked into spastic, momentary existence 
Witness the birth of time 

Coalescing particles to form realms anew 
Devouring star systems to fuel this inferno 
Time, space, matter, and mass 
Life and death 
A particle universe is born 

5,000 years watching in silence 
Contemplating the coming war 
The universe in the palms of my hands 
The awe, am I worthy of this? 

A thunderous roar inside the great halls 
Echoes throughout the essence of being 
Sparked into spastic, momentary existence 
Witness the birth of time 

An ungodly roar from absent eyes 
Eviscerates through ancient machinery 
An experiment to begin eternal war 
Existence becomes my weapon 

Have I become a monster, or am I still man? 
Questions that no longer seem relevant 
For in my hatred and anger I 
Will become anything that I must
