[The Archaeologist:]
Prometheus, can you see this?

[Prometheus:]
Images coming in clear, but what do I see?

[The Archaeologist:]
It is death by the thousands
A drop of liquid to destroy existence
Disassembling the twisted ladder of
Our imperfect DNA

Oh Engineer, can you hear me?
Why do you despise us?
What have we done to deserve your scorn?
Why god, why? Tell me now!

[The Infected:]
Prometheus, can't you hear me?
You cannot allow this plague to persist

[Prometheus:]
What is happening, what of this death you speak?

[The Infected:]
Please just listen, for you must kill me! Please!

[The Archaeologist:]
Prometheus, forgive me! For you must sacrifice

[Prometheus:]
Yes, we know
This is to be our fate
Fire on
Ion propulsion

[The Archaeologist:]
LV â 223, your disease will not claim me!
I want to know, I deserve to know!
Seek out my maker, to know my destroyer
And let me fury be known!
