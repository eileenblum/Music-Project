Our minds are the Earth atop the sea 
A fragile ship drifting amongst cosmic waves 
Immersed in this obtuse reality 
Minds separate and drown alone 
Winds guide our consciousness to the skies 
Where our bodies rest in the seas of Sol 
The Earth and the sun drift away, lost forever to the stars 

The black hole inside you is consuming your form 
Slowly taking you from me 
I Cannot believe that I allowed this to happen to you.... 

Galaxies fall apart 
Crumble lifelessly into colliding... 
Waves crash against the stars drowning them in our seas 
Swallowed with the Earth 
Infinity is the only thing I'll long for 
Just one more century 
To undo all that I have ... 
Done to this world, to myself 
But I shall remain 
Pariah Unforgiven 

Our minds we're the Earth atop the sea

Minds separate and die...
