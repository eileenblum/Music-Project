Cimmerian sights 
Lightless towers 
Galactic facade 
Wave distorter 

Dense line of frantic pleas 
The sounds of dying worlds 
Everything we thought we knew 
Always has it been like this? 

Chaos and unrest 
Like a plague it spreads 
Women, children and men 
Human... and Alien 

Neutron transmitters 
Surrounded by the abyss 
Decipher and distort 
Our visible light 

From the structure I see 
Infinite lightless voids 
Towers raised in oppression 
Controlling our evolution 

Infiltrate the great barriers 
Assimilate a billion years 

I can hear the death throes 
Of an ancient alien world 
I can hear the dying screams 
Of a trillion beautiful souls 

In the great distance I see 
The implosion of a galaxy 
In the vast expanse I see 
Points of light flashing then ending 

Built on the deaths of a hundred million worlds 
Filtering perceivable light 
Creating and manufacturing our perception 
Never knowing the obscured truth 

In the great distance I see 
The implosion of a galaxy 
In the vast expanse I see 
A vast array of lights ending 

Cimmerian sights 
Lightless towers 
Galactic facade 
Wave distorter 

Master of the abyss 
Banned from the heavens 
Shrouding all our worlds	
The Great Aphotic Barriers
