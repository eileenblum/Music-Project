Dark skies looming over me
Lifetime of battles to be undone
Welting atmospheres descend
With haste I must complete this

Disconnect from my reality
Upload into the greater universe
Useless body a broken shell
Expanding consciousness
Enter the void

Until my dying day
I pursued one goal
To leave existence behind
To become a God

Mountains collapse around me
The soil beneath disappearing
Final moment I pray this works

Disconnect from my reality
Upload into the greater universe
Useless body a broken shell
Expanding consciousness
Enter the void

In my dying hour
Did I succeed?
An onset of blackness
But where am I?

Disconnect from my reality
Upload into the greater universe
Useless body a broken shell
Expanding consciousness
Enter the void

Bursts of light surround me
Body extending infinite
I look down upon the devastation
Am I becoming a God?
