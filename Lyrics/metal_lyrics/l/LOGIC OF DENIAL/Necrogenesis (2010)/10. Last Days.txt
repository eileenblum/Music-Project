I've given you everything I have, I've climbed the highest mountains of faith, I've brought the decay on their lives, without saying a word... I fight my war against their lifeless God. Father, I've dipped in black my thirst of blood. Submitting to your strength, searching the way for the eternal thruth. Maybe my flight is ended, maybe these are my last days. Every breath suffocates me, I feel the weight of defeat. Eternal darkness for me.
