The grudge of the ancient ones swallows my thoughts. I can no longer tolerate the slapping of the sea, for I hear the cries. Maybe the time has come, the truth darkens my heart. Lying to my eyes I deny.
I feel the walls close in about me. Is it? Could it be? I hear them. The Hounds come and I am doomed. Eternity too short. We hunt a horror that feeds on human tears. I feel the walls close in about me. Is it? Could it be? I hear them. The Hounds come and I am doomed.
Eternity too short. Raising demons, and the dead. Traces of death...breeding. Seeds of decay...spreading. For I hear the cries. Maybe the time has come, the truth darkens my heart. Lying to my eyes... Spawns of the Old Ones covered the Earth, until the end of the Aeon.
The tuneless laments of hideous flutes...blind idiot gods.
