Reviving from suffering, nourished from hate. He consumes the light of existence. Lost in oblivion, the human knowledge dies, facing the strength of the eternity, hating his own life. Listen to the rhythm of the waves, listen to the Lord of Destruction. Trace of a shade, disowned martyr. He lives, he will die, he will leave, he will come again. Purify my soul, embrace my empty life, make your thruth my faith. Turn your hell in my heaven and save me. Yog Sothoth knows the gate.Yog Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and the guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. Lost in oblivion, the human knowledge dies, facing the strength of the eternity, hating his own life. Listen to the rhythm of the waves, listen to the Lord of Destruction. Purify my soul, embrace my empty life, make your thruth my faith. Turn your hell in my heaven and save me. Reviving from suffering, nourished from hate. He consumes the light of existence.
