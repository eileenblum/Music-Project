You chase the truth from a whole life, leading your mind to unlit places, looking for lost knowledge, obsessed. The thirst is consuming yourself, the whimpering of insanity. You'll never see the eternal light, you're flying too high, the pitch will come untied. The Truth is searching you, relentless. At last your time is ended. Smile, filthy man, because now you know. Can you see the depravity? In this place you feel the void, crushed by insanity... waiting the advent of the Beast.
