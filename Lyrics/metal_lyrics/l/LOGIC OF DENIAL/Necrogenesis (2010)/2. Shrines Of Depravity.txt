The black pharaoh is waiting behind the sun. No more life after his passage, only dead bodies and dryness. Untidy in the wind, the sadistic sorcerer drains creature's lives, between screams and pain.
His existence is marked by blood, in their fleshes he retrieves his purpose. To see is to die. Bow you to the strenghth of Nephren-Ka. To fight is to get lost. Bow you to Nephren-Ka. The black wind will embrace you, crushing your breath, consuming you slowly, devouring your ashes. Foolish who tries to stop him, wise who fears his voice. Nothing can survive to his cruelty. Also the stones desire to die.
