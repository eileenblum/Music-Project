You smile at me from the golden throne, hangman of lost - mislaid - sheeps, holder of a power based on lies, murderer of fearful willingness.
Your fucking credence, my reality, come on prayer, dissect my faith. Disrupting me, relentlessly, come on prayer, dissect my faith.
Scarifying your existence with deceptive decrees, you're only a pawn of your own fear of living.
Lost in the oblivion of mortality, your soul is breeding their God, searching the way of redemption, dying to breath in another life. Come on, dissect my faith.
