The pupil dilates, my mind roams into unknown. I breathe the death. I'm just fighting with myself, something subdues me. The grief devours me, killing what's real. There's no hope in the valley of the damned, run away from R'lyeh. Traces of pain crowd the air, I suffocate into eternal darkness. Lost souls, slaughtered...
Chtulhu Ftaghn...
Come and see, nistagmo.
