Torn by thoughts, my path is twisted. Walls of a lifeless life creep into my veins. They're glows of vitality, they've passed away. No hope for the damned. Severed. Suffocating to breathe again, my body rejects the atonement, devoured by spawns of hate. On that throne I pay the price of humanity. Enter the room of the deadly pleasure, donât let fear make you tremble. Let yourself be enchanted, I'll join you in the pleasures of death. Welcome, this is my slaughterhouse. I feel you now, behind that door your breaths are labored. The limbs stiffen, the skin becomes dry. Your voice is just an hiss. Decrepit visions of unholy decay, I shall live, behold the throne of torture. Death, breathe.
