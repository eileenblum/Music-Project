Orchestration of pure loathing embodied, like litanies into a forsaken abyss. Emerge from putrid ashes to condemn every pawn to its own abhorrent demise. Atonement through unholy acrimony.
Follow the path into a deformed salvation. Beneath the rotting skies I prey the inhuman grace of perpetual annihilation. Hatred towards the putrid throne of deception. Shred the veil of inhuman upheaval, serving the parable of unholy corruption. Ecthra, pure stagnation into eternal affliction.
Below the heavenly skies, the scourge of perennial misery. Embrace the inhuman sufferance to reach the shapeless way of catharsis. Remnants of a disgusting past, your denied existence drained all its misery. The unholy preaching of a ferocious expiration. I deny every glimpse of light upon thee, for the perennial era of unconceivable torture has come. Every drop of mercy falls below the misconceived path of oblivion. I desecrate with unmerciful sermons of atrocious atonement and litanies of a degenerating maelstrom. Devouring the flesh of impure acrimony. Summoning with loathing and despair the breaths of a senseless existence. Despise the sun below the rotting skies of disillusion. I deny every remnants of this everlasting sufferance.
