Grotesque visions of a distorted reality. Absolving my soul into sufferance. Exiled from a godless reality. Catharsis through deformed spheres, drawing patterns of ominous dreams. Traces of an amorphous reality. Manipulation for eternal servitude, for stagnation is pure life. Litany of my desperate dreams, splinters of my nameless future, perennial agony within. Suffocating into insignificant structures. Searching my light to paradise. Praying on a faithful desire. Embracing this way to catatonia, I weep upon repugnance.
