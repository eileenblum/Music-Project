The congregation of distorted memories praying upon the apostles of misery. Spewing decrees of holy deception on the ancient books of manipulation. Litany of disgusting faith. Ingesting its reverent pawns. Punishing with hours of penance the obsequiously praising creatures.
Degenerating spirals of iconoclastic fury towards misbegotten sons of manipulating servitude. Ruining the pillars of amorphous prophecies, ushering to the dusk of their servile creed. Mutilating the holy archangels, revealing their hideous bliss. Fulfilling with blasphemy the oracles of iniquity, they submerge the temples into vomit and despair. Servants of an useless creed. Prophets by manipulation.
