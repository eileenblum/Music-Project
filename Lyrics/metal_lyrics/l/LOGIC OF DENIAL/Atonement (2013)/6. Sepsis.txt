Catharsis into virulent possession, negation of the self to fulfill an inextricable desire. Perpetually denying the absolution, rejecting the atonement of soul. Kneeling at the throne of temptation. Subjugated by eternal misery. Strangled by lust and betrayal. My shadowed soul, sepsis. A bittersweet delight of magnificent embrace. My shadowed soul, sepsis. Amongst circles of lustful subjugation, forged into everlasting shades of impenetrable immensity. Creeping towards the throne of temptation. Punishment through atrocious denial. Accept this infection as a sentence of sublime anguish. Devoured by embodied deception.
