Seeking the way for an aprioristic knowledge, trailed in the abyss of ignorance. Abomination.
You bend down to darkness. The eternal cycle of existence dies in your complaints. Your life is only a meaningless stain into mediocrity. Turn your gaze to eternity, lost soul. The knowledge nails you to trascendency. Redemption looks after you, pieces of shapeless flesh have prevented it. Now you can be one. Redemption, praise to the atonement. Abomination, praise to the denial of truth. The world is only a gloomy room, the light abroad. Embrace the ways that you have never attempted to cross. Dissect your mind to retain infinity. Seeking the way for a fucking knowledge, deny every bound and bathe your gaze into Aeon's blood. Face the patterns of oblivion to be Conscience again.
