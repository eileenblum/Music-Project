Savior, allow his grieved soul to survive. No one will be blind. Hangman, remove the clouding from his rage. Kill the faith that enchains. Burnt by the sun, your words are only a whisper. The mind is caged in a room, no windows in here. No more dogma, the conscience will show you the truth. Ethos Ã nthropo dÃ imon. Between good and evil, apocrypha. They have indoctrinated you, treated you as a slave. Shapeless soul wandering between other's thoughts. Tortured spirit, you cry freethinking's death. Before the end we're all the same thing.
