Rebirth through atonement is near, the circle of the eternal suffering cannot be broken. You sip out the life from your impure herd, feeding yourself with their howls. Shepherd of depraved souls, trembling voice of putrefaction. Torn apart from their corpses, their souls reclaim to die.
âSufferâ, they say. âThereâs no salvationâ. Their prayers so feeble, the altars of torture reclaim their sacrifice. Devourment of sacrilege, the end is near. No one shall be saved from the gates of perdition. Devouring the divine, eroding their existence (into a stinking annihilation), your depraved faith is gorging on the saviour. Their minds are severed and slaughtered. Invoking the atonement, perpetual salvation. Your depraved faith is gorging on the saviour. Forever.
