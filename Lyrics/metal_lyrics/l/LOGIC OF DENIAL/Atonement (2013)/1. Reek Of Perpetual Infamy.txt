Unfolding revelations of infamous penance, where the sufferance stench lies. Loathing the oppressors is futile. Visions of a truthless faith. Secreting hatred revealed. Atonement through unholy decay. Condemned to perpetual infamy, Iâm a trace of a shade. Formulas of everlasting dementias to preserve my flesh and my soul from the convulsive struggle within. Orchestration of eternal sufferance. No belief in a saving grace. Putrid deliverance of a senseless torture. My only dream is to breath the unholy reek of perpetual infamy. Insignificant, rotten breed, counting days to inner derangement. Searching my path to atonement through the chapters of imposed apathy.
