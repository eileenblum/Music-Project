Their lack of foresight 
Invokes the catastrophe 
Modern cynics crassly ignored 
It is us who will see triumph 
Living amongst the ruins 
Of the great american empire 

This world long forgotten 
Will show its true colors 
The last two hundred years 
Are reduced to a nightmare 
But man carved a scar 
That will always show 
In time this all will pass 

Wandering amongst the forest 
Feet sink in damp loam 
A life headed nowhere 
I sit and wait for spring 
Sun sets beneath branches 
Memories overwhelmed by grief 
I reflect in solitude
