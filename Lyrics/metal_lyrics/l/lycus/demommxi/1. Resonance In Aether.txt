Our bleak days wither in 
The infinite flood of time 
Soon displaced melancholy 
Hearts brightened with reckoning 
Man walks with treachery 
Eyes open but unseeing 

Modern times breed disgust 
Amidst broken realms and squalor 
Dark light in their eyes 
My soul fills with famine 

Relinquish this madness 
A task for the wretched 
The end is near 
No matter how distant 
Souls bathing in black 
My vision turns starry 

Awakening from the dream 
Of civilization's delusion 
These ghosts of past failures 
Haunt the pale light of the end 
Somber forms turn to shadows 
And dance engulfed in the blaze 

Streets crawl with lifeless corpses 
Marching to slow demise 
Heads down in complacence 
They fade into the distance 
Arms folded in obedience 
Subdued by ignorance and fear 

All voices soon silenced 
With fire and ash that cloaks 
Our despair like moonlit fog 
This world will be liberated 
As embers of the past 
Vanish in the nigh
