Oh Mother
Oh Father
This was never meant to be

Oh Mother
Oh Father
Relinquish this mistake of a life

Upon waking
Weightless and solitary
I suffer through the void
On the perilous bridge
Between body and spirit
I linger in lore of disgust

This wretched body
The prison of the soul
Weighted by the chains of depression
I could never bear to let you in

Awaiting the footsteps
Stained by revelations
I could never bear to let you in

A tyrannous shyness envelops me
I gaze to the sky with obsidian eyes
In the crawl space I will always be
Nothing to bring me from my knees
