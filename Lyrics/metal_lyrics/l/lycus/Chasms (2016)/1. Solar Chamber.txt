I bleed boundless in reverie
In woe I am vindicated

Rising of the sweltering sun
Streams of venomous light descend
Impurity swells in a fever of reflection
A plague of a secret unveiled

Sinking in pale misery
Crimson eyes cast searing stares I turn away
Yet they still remain
I lock myself away
Yet they still remain

A body wrapped in wavering veins
Choking and abandoned
I watched each one collapse
Tears of distress erode the flesh
Breathe deep in the dead of night
Caressed by sin

Lost within boundless winds
I fear the coming blaze

I return to solace
Torn and tarnished
Forgotten and grieving

The sun will crucify a staggered soul
The sun will burn the cancer we have become
Death will be the savior

Forever I crave the velvet night
Forever enslaved to the shadows of twilight
