Giving into the evils of empathy
Hollow pillars uphold a bedlam of lies
In the dawning of blind love
Deviant devotion is carved into stone

Falling into a fateful night
Fumes of failure arise again
From the sickness and bliss of the needle

I fucking begged
You could only see
What I never wanted to be

Loveless words burn so brightly
Insecurities bleed
I touch but can no longer feel
The throbbing hand of need
This place has become so toxic
Yet we still need to breathe

Break one more promise
I canât save you
Burn one more promise
You canât save me
