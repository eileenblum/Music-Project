A tenebrous rose
Revels in misery
Wilting with fatal mystique
Yet to drown
Tears crawl down
Longing for some kind of escape
Looming with astral elegance
Insatiable desires
Plunging into forbidden play
The scars of sickness
Perennial suffering
The precious poison
Won't wash this curse away
Pleasure to pain
Shackles clench tighter
Sanity frays
Clinging to life
While nurturing death
Another petal falls away
