Days blur together
Fading in obscurity
Nightmare of my mind
Tortured by reminiscence
Haunted by bittersweet memories

As acid rain corrodes and drains
Rendered engravings impose woeful shame
Gracefully fierce with a tone that abrades
Lacing a trait that sinks and fades

Chasmal and eternal
They dispel vitality
Compulsive and incessant
They deprave morality

Like a stigma burned into the hide of an animal
They exemplify enslavement to an infallible malefactor

As I drift withdrawn from a state of solace
A blanket of haze is sought with haste
Beneath an ephemeral shelter of crimson cirrus
I am transfixed by grace until impaled and displaced
