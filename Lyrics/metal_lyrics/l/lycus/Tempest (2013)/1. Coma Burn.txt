Hostage to a history of tormenting grey
Draped in times of perpetual strain
Blind to each moment I strive to see
In a coma I fuel the flames of grief
The shroud of smoke cowers and daunts
Polluting the mind with crippling haunts
Doubt is risen and desire falls frail
When a broken spirit rests bitterly still

The poison dissipates as winds cleanse the sky
Flames burn tame invoking vision to a blind eye
Encompassed by tranquility
A being reborn
Is scathed by betrayal and scarred by scorn

Hatred is spawned by a love once drowned
The harp of grace cried a bellowing sound
A coma burn regressed to an infectious wound
As light deflects from a misanthropic moon
