With a gaze into the seas
Swelling with bile
Intimations unveil
Divine yet vile

A solitary lust
Spores into deterioration
And douses the candle of reconciliation

Cherish the asylum
For it will soon decay
And wither into a hell
Manifested by dismay

Into the toils of despair
We are bludgeoned by desire
Bound by truth
Within a disillusioned mire

Voices of distress
Plead for serenity
In the hour of tempest
Accursed with tyranny

Cease this agony
Black sea
Swallowing misery
Forever
Shimmer vanishes
Close my eyes
