I know my words won't cause you harm
It's hard to reason out and charm
But don't we always do?
So summon all you wanna-be's
Show your crude fraternity
This poem is for you

Poems to whom it may concern
No need to know, no need to learn
I'm sick of you

Progression's gold is all you see
Scrawl out your shit and leave me be
The savior marks his fall

Every night
You lie awake
Hear my voice
Murmuring the truth
Zero poems and lines of agony
You feel the sun
You will never see
You're alone
And you will ever be
Evil flow and chains of poverty

Dance
Close to the edge
But never I'll lose my mind
And I
Will never forget those of the
Deceiving kind

We're jostling for a bashful smile
When fear sleeps for a while
I know the price

A time of poverty and dreams
Not every truth is what it seems
Just recognize

Dance
Close to the edge
But never I'll lose my mind
And I
Will never forget those of the
Deceiving kind

Tell me, are you free?

Every night
You lie awake
Hear my voice
Murmuring the truth
Zero poems and lines of agony
You feel the sun
You will never see
You're alone
And you will ever be
Evil flow and chains of poverty

Dance
Close to the edge
But never I'll lose my mind
And I
Will never forget those of the
Deceiving kind

Dance
Close to the edge
But never I'll lose my mind
And I
Will never forget those of the
Deceiving kind
