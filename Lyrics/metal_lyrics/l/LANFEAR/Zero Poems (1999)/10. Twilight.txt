(Just on the border of your waking mind)
(There lies... another time)
(Where darkness and light are one)
(And as you tread the halls of sanity)
(You feel so glad to be)
(Unable to go beyond)
(I have a message)
(From another time...)

The visions dancing in my mind
The early dawn the shades of time
Twilight crawling through my windowpane

Am I awake or do I dream
The strangest pictures I have seen
Night is day and twilight's gone away

With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight
I only meant to stay a while
Twilight
I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me

Across the night I saw your face
You disappeared without a trace
You brought me here but can you take me back

Inside the image of your light
That now is day and once was night
You left me here and then you go away

With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or is it dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight
I only meant to stay a while
Twilight
I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me

You brought me here but can you take me back again?

With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight
I only meant to stay a while
Twilight
I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me
I only meant to stay a while
Twilight
I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me
