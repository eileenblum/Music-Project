[We are...the never closing]

[Part I:]
Once we had it all and didn't know it's there
Altered minds and perfect visions everywhere
Now I touch the loss and watch the seasons fall
In this static crypt I hear the idols call

[Part II:]
I have changed my mind. Die welt verÃ¤ndert mich,
Just in time, for everything must change,
Denke oft an dich. I think you for the times
I used the same, can nothing last forever?

What once was is now in dust again

Fall to see the light of God
Fall to feel the hand of God
To receive brave man's diversity
To believe there's no eternity
To receive brave man's diversity
To believe there is no eternity

In the eyes of the naked
