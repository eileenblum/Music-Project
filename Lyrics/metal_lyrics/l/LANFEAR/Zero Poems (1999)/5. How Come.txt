She feeds her mind 'cause I am here
A frozen sun is drawing near
Ignore my words, hey, I am to blame
Define my hope by another name

[Commercial Break:]
"Hi, this is Betty Bloom, and I've sold the moon, so dial fast and watch my skin, it's the lunar kin."

Today I've heard the men of word
"In between the will and dream there lives our hope",
They kindly spoke
Last night I've seen the comet's gleam
Eternally he has to flee
Without a clue - as we always do

Ignore my words, hey, I'm to blame
Define my hope by another name
Spit out your words, yours is disgrace
How come you laugh in this dying place

Ignore my words, hey, I'm to blame
Define my hope by another name
Spit out your words, yours is disgrace
How come you laugh in this dying place

Now that I'm here,
I raise my cup for absent friends.
I've tamed the wild sea
With my tears and touched the free-cloud

Show me today and make me smile,
I'm not pretending for a while,
Occupied pieces are the prey,
Ivory towers made of clay
Don't let us down, we beat the blast,
Let us explore the pools of lust.
Searching for something we don't know
Fasten your belts,
Enjoy the show!

On our way through the wastelands
Our steps are frayed by the wind...

Stand outside the bubble
And you think it's time to go.
Count the fading stars inside your dreams

Hurray! What manly men, the pioneer's parade
But hold your horses friend,
We're thirty years
Thirty years
Too late...

Ignore my words, hey, I'm to blame
Define my hope by another name
Spit out your words, yours is disgrace
How come you laugh in this dying place

"If you visit our store,
You will find your and more.
We've got hope to sell
And if you dream of Hell
Try our sound and our banquet."

England is sold by the pound.
The taste's acquired, the king has sold his crown
Define my hope by another name
The gen is "off", the "yes" is "no"
We're out of focus,
Very far from... darkness
Define my hope by another name
