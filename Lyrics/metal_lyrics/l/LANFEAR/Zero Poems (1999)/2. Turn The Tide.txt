Take care!
The flame is flickering
The splinter hurts
The eyes of god
Beware!
We're drowning the isle again
The very thought
Is bursting my mind

Right now
We're pacing the speed of life
Our fucked up minds
Are screaming for more
Millennium
I hail your uneven beat
The melody
Of men and machines

Turn the tide
Take me far away
Cover me!
Innocence
Treated like a whore
Turn the tide

What once was gold
Is turning to piles of shit
What once was love
Must ever be love
So start to think
Refined the revealing scroll
The king is dead
Long live the king!

Turn the tide
Take me far away
Cover me!
Innocence
Treated like a whore
Turn the tide

Turn the tide (Turn the tide)
Take me far away (Take me far away and cover me)
Cover me!
Innocence (Innocence treated like a whore)
Treated like a whore (Turn the tide and cover me)
Turn the tide (Turn the tide)
Turn the tide (Turn the tide)
Take me far away (Take me far away and cover me)
Cover me!
Turn the tide (Turn the tide)
