Alone again the silent waves
Remind the love we gave
In solace we depend and dream
Of sun and moonlit green

When there's nothing left to say
All the hope we let astray
And turn
To stone

After the
Electric storm
There's nothing like
It was before
Hall of frames
I'm coming home
I'm waiting
Life
Is even more

Time stand stills, the sprawl lurks far away
The taste of tea in may
A cyber sea in tranquil gear
Again the night is near

When there's nothing left to say
All the hope we let astray
And turn
To stone

After the
Electric storm
There's nothing like
It was before
Hall of frames
I'm coming home
I'm waiting
Life
Is even more
