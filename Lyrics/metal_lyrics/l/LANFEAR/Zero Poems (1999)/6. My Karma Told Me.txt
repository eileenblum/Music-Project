I used to like my face
Until the day
The crack in the mirror
Was telling me lies
She used to stare at the sun
Until the day
The pain in her eyes said
Her sundown will never come

You can try to hide by living
But you'll never find my heart
I am sick and bored of giving
I am drifting part by part

My Karma told me
Not to cross that line
She might be my saviour
But all is doing fine
My Karma told me
I am on my own
There's nothing worth dying
And so I burn alone

It's so hard to understand
The cards are at your hand
But you don't know the game

And here we go again
Live separate lives
I smile and I joke
She will never know my dreams

I apologize my habits
But I cannot close my eyes
There's no end in the beginning
In my hands my future lies

My Karma told me
Not to cross that line
She might be my saviour
But all is doing fine
My Karma told me
I am on my own
There's nothing worth dying
And so I burn alone

It's a strange life
I'm half the man I used to be
But after all I'm feeling stronger

It's a strange life
I'm half the man I used to be
But after all I'm feeling stronger

It's a strange life
I'm half the man I used to be
But after all I'm feeling stronger
