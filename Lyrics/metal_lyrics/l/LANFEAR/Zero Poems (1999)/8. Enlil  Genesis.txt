[A Cosmic Drama, Part II]

[The Annunaki-Lord Enlil has visited Earth to create and study a new race - the humans. His experiment - mixing native's DNA with his DNA was successful. The generations to come soon will rise to rebuild the planet by using the knowledge and powers of their cosmic father...]

"I've watched the universe a million years ago,
I know the secrets no one else will know
Into oblivion the other gods have marched,
But I am still the One known on the elder stars

I've seen the black holes burning
And watched the downfall of Xy,
Triumph - the progress of learning,
I am the powers that be

Bounds of Deimos are whispering my name,
New pyramids and runes, it's everywhere the same
Genetic works are done on planet-2-of-Sol,
Now I am heading for the light, the blackest hole

Call me Lord Technology,
Enlil the Great, Father Time
Damn all false diversity,
I am the way, life is mine"

[In his absence the court of Deneb Prime judges over Enlil]

"Enlil from Phaethon
You're guilty we plead
Renegade, you have no home,
So sail the astral sea

Enlil from Phaethon
You're guilty we plead
Renegade, you have no home,
So sail the astral sea"

"in darkness we are born - we're forlorn
In darkness we are born - we transform

In darkness we are born - we're forlorn
In darkness we are born - we transform"

[And so the last of the Annunaki-Lords, Enlil, sets course to the center of the universe, to the last unsolved mystery, to the heart of the blackest hole...]

"Transwarp, your quest is acknowledged,
We're leaving the cluster of light
Farewell, now we are transforming,
We enter the heart of the blackest hole...NOW!"
