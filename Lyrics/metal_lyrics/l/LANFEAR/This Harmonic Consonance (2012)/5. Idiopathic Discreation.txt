Alone and scared
You won't save me
I fear all the bloodstains that should not be

It's too obscure and unknown to consider
And I'll wait for the final breakdown

No hope, but I'll pray for salvation
My breathing, like a scream and it's just for me

No breaking of the dawn â why me of all people
Beginning of the end â I'm barely alive
Shock waves of an inborn idiopathic discreation
I just want to fade away, no place to hide

On the edge of my despair
Left to choke on scattered thoughts
Whimpered prayers, still unheard

So where is god?

Crossing the cancered line, delimitating life
Deludes my jades eyes
Thrown into a broken world
I don't know where to turn
I'll walk this path 'til I die

Ever present, I have to face up to it
I won't be nailed to insecurities
All the fake healers, I can't stand 'em anymore
Shaking and trembling is what I feel

On the edge of my despair
Left to choke on scattered thoughts
Whimpered prayers, still unheard

So where is god?

Crossing the cancered line, delimitating life
Deludes my jades eyes
Thrown into a broken world
I don't know where to turn
I'll walk this path 'til I die

I sailed through seas of debility
Don't know the truth they're looking to seek
Another hurt to heal
The years went by so fast and I can't change the past

Hel me trying to thwart my dying
â¦to cry
â¦to deny
â¦to fly away

On the edge of my despair
Left to choke on scattered thoughts
Whimpered prayers, still unheard

So where is god?

Crossing the cancered line, delimitating life
Deludes my jades eyes
Thrown into a broken world
I don't know where to turn
I'll walk this path 'til die

Come on and shine, wherever you are
Share the light within your heart

I don't want to read my lifeline
Beyond my silent cries
As restless and wanderer

And the darkness in my soul veiled an owing ray of home
I'll keep it 'til I die
