Iâve spoiled your dignity
Youâre accusing me of perversity
But remember Iâm just a victim, so please forgive me

Unclaimed fears
Iâve lost control of my frantic dark desires
I donât want to mistreat you, just to abuse you

The truth itself is untrue to those who walk in darkness,
Reckoning, Suffering

Iâll save you from the sinister signs
No more savage sentiments
An unholy truth beneath desires
Iâll wash your sense away
so bow down to the reverend

Voices sing in twisted tongues
A hymn of praise to please the Lord
Neither lies nor lack of clarity,
my sought-after beauty

Sounds of lewdness, crawling along your neck
Shaken by the memories, spinning in your head
Thereâs one thing that should guide our way
Maybe youâre just another priestâs prey

The truth itself is untrue to those who hold ones peace.
Oh, this silence is deafening

Iâll save you from the sinister signs
No more savage sentiments
An unholy truth beneath desires
Iâll wash your sense away
Just bow down to the reverend

Celibacy â nympholepsy
Debauchery - double standards

The truth itself is untrue to those who hold ones peace.
Oh, this silence is deafening

Iâll save you from the sinister signs
No more savage sentiments
An unholy truth beneath desires
Iâll wash your sense away
Just bow down to the reverend
