(the white one)
The evil and the righteous
An ambiguous alliance
Convicted of avarice
The foretold conquest has begun

Visions of wisdom are blurring and fading away

(The red one)
The Creation, defeated
Mayhem and war are proceeding
A given power to make brothers slay each other

Circling in spirals of violence, no compromise

Wake me from this treacherous dream
Bittersweet, the taste of ruin
Expect the dawn of reckoning
Everything seems to be drawn into a maelstrom of confusion
And the last one obliterates the colours of existence

(The black one)
Come, come, come
You bringer of famine
Tormentor of withered lands
Initiator of disaster
Conjure the collapse of world markets

(The pale one)
A virulent dimension to realize
Now there would be time for everything
Iâm watching you disappear
I let you die

Bleeding eyes, open wide
Too see abomination of desolation
Welcome to those who fulfill an ancient prophecy

Wake me from this treacherous dream
Bittersweet, the taste of ruin
Expect the dawn of reckoning
Everything seems to be drawn into a maelstrom of confusion
And the last one obliterates the colours of existence
