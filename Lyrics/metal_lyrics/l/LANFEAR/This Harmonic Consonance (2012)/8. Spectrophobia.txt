Trapped within this frantic life
Hiding behind their disguise
Yearning for my time to come
Reflecting on a word that passed me by

In the mirror, the perfection lies
I hesitate to unfold the truth about superficial life
Shallow reflections of my inner self
All this pain confirms the man I had become

I force myself to confront to thought
Which reminds me who I am
Am I just a pathetic and tragic character
Who fails to succeed?

In the mirror, the perfection lies
I hesitate to unfold the truth about superficial life
Shallow reflections of my inner self
All this pain confirms the man I had become

Haunted by the silhouettes of my creed
Enamoured by the visions of the other side
The mirror image turns to black
Involved in a conspiracy of silence

Concealed, discreeted
Delved into abstruse aspects
Resistant towards damage
Bemazed, distressed
Underneath the surface
A volatile delusion reflects my life

In the mirror, the perfection lies
I hesitate to unfold the truth about superficial life
Shallow reflections of my inner self
All this pain confirms the man I had become
