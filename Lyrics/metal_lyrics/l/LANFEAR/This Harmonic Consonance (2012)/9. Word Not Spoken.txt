I'd seen our world in a different light, for awhile
Welcome to erase the blackness of my remembrance
Honestly, I tried to force all my regrets to collide in the center of my heart

Day by day, I was searching for what's behind the common fragile minds
I should do my predetermined duty
I'm still longing to die for the word not spoken

People all around me, but no one seems to face the damage that I've done
(like a winged balancer of life)
Blinded by my doubts and hopes
Burst into my mind with glaring light
(like the radiance of a thousand suns)

Trapped within these altered games
Wondering if all my regrets have left the center of my heart

Day by day, I walked the path unchosen
Armed with time on my side to feel real life
Tell me why I'm still looking for some traces in my mind,
Latent scars left by the word unspoken

Words, all those token words
Continuously spoken
A dream, it's just a dream I had
It was hanging by a thread

A mistaking meaning, exhausting are the ways of today
I'm losing touch from the false sense of suffering
Anyhow, my acting is affected by the effigy of my scars

Day by day, I walked the path unchosen
Armed with time on my side to feel real life
I'm still looking for some traces in my mind,
And I'm still longing to hear the word not spoken
