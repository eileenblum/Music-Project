I am new bionic version
A convenience for mankind
A divine revelation
And transhumanized

Reborn and enhanced by complex superior implants
Unknown and non linear effects occur

Inhuman externally (I'll never reach your heaven)
But a human being internally (voiceless inside)
I feel silent now I am fading faster
Your imperfection I analyze

Beneath a digital horizon,
Technologies changed my life
Blasphemy or perversion?
Ignorance never dies

Behind a screen, omni-present but unseen
A near-conscious state of mind
Redesigned to live unkind

Inhuman externally (I'll never reach your heaven)
But a human being internally (voiceless inside)
I feel silent now I am fading faster
Your imperfection I analyze

Transcendence of the human body
I'm the new awakening of a
Simulated, disintegrated reality

Behind a screen, omni-present but unseen
(coercive eugenicism, the post-human future lies)
A near-conscious state of mind
Redesigned to live unkind

Inhuman externally (I'll never reach your heaven)
But a human being internally (voiceless inside)
I feel silent now I am fading faster
Your imperfection I analyze
