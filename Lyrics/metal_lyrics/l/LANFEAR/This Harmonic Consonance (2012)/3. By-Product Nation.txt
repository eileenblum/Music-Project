Take a look through the eyes of broken innocence and shelter
Selfcaged in complacency and then vanished in a haze

The motion of all counterparts squelches beloved uniqueness
And in the presence of my enemies, stagnation is now complete

As a consequence, senses whirl deeper into daunting apathy
Exceptions prove the rule

Policed by the media, their doctrine: âThou shalt consume!â
The fountainhead of our civilization
Neglected People, Just a by-product of the business?
In pools of paranoia we drown our sorrows

As a consequence, senses whirl deeper into hate and selfishness,
My worst expectations come true

Are we living in different places?
Iâm surrounded by deadpan faces
Shall we inherit poisoned feast of so-called gods
I donât spread their lies!

Open wide, breathe the dust and the sentiment does not sit square with your experiences
Iâm lost in the darkness of ignorance, overwhelmed by disdain

I differ from you, Iâm disgusted by your unfair practices
Mesmerized by vanity
Not trapped in a weird dream
I wonder why?
How can that be?

Iâve learned the answer is opaque

As a consequence, senses whirl deeper into hate and selfishness,
My worst expectations come true

Are we living in different places?
Iâm surrounded by deadpan faces
Shall we inherit poisoned feast of so-called gods?
I donât spread their lies!
