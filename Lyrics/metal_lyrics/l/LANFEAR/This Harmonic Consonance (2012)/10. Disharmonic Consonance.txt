Do listen! This disharmonic consonance

Fooled by shimmering signs
Sometimes distorted lines misdirect my mind
A perceptual disturbance

I keep moving to modulated sounds
Visions drift in and out
A change in cognition

Transmit signals to confine the infinite design of a neuronal homicide

I convinced myself to leave this maze where surreal voices speak
There's an emptiness that I never thought I'd feel
It surround me

A question of fear is:
"Why are we here?"
Just to emit a burst of electrochemical pulses?
A psycho incident regained the memories of untimed miseries

Disorders of consciousness, the absence of real life
But who decides?

I convinced myself to leave this maze where surreal voices speak
There's an emptiness that I never thought I'd feel
It surround me

It's the fall of conception, I'm so scared of myself
It can't be just perception in action, I must leave this place
Welcome to the phase of selection, madness shall rise

I convinced myself to leave this maze where surreal voices speak
There's an emptiness that I never thought I'd feel
It surround me
