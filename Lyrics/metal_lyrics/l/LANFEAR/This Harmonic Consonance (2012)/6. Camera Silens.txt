Subsistence, a shadow hides my eyes
Relentless, dignity thrown aside
Retribution, sedative medicine
Through this pain, so far beyond the screams

Cruel delusions and hallucinations of isolation
Merciless power of persuasion
Save me from this living nightmare without an end

Aberration, madness will rise
Severe maltreatment, advised sacrifice
Reveals the nature of humankind
Lost in mind immolation

Fragments of memory
Observation, inhale invisible death
Mental collapse, estranged reality
Thought reform, remainder of a scream

There is no door in these cold four walls, no resistance
Merciless gathering of information
Save me from this living nightmare without an end

Aberration, madness will rise
Severe maltreatment, advised sacrifice
Reveals the nature of humankind
Lost in mind immolation

Petrified in the core of darkness
Swallowed light, am I alive?
Authorized sensory deprivation
Shattered screams night after night

The loneliness will never leave you
They get what they want without having to hit you
That's why they call it white torture
You being to break and then you being to confess
The loneliness will never leave you
They get what they want without having to hit you
That's why they call it white torture
You being to break and then you being to confess
