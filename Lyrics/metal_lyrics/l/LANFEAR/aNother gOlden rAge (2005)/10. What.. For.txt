Trying
To become
The best that I can
But giving it all
Won't seem to be enough
Running in circles
No chance to start
Where it all has begun
Eternity's ending
A place not meant to be

Learning to forget
Rising to tumble down again

[Chorus:]
What...for?
When nothing's enduring
Right in the end
What...for?
Taking the pains
Just to achieve even none

I thought
Life was meant
To raise some changes
To live your dreams
No hiding in despair
Then you will find out
That all's for nothing ever after
No way to break out
From this cage of mind

[Chorus]

Crying to regret
Trying just to fail again

[Chorus]
