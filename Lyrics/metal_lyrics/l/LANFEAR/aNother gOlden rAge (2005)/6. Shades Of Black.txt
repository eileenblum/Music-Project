I'm your nightmare
All you've ever feared
Your path to blackness
I am the spawn of your despite 
Awakened

[Prechorus:]
The vicious minds became alive
My darkness swallows up the light
Your soul's forsaken
See what volition can create
I'm just the spawn of your despite
Darkness awakened
Face your fortune now

[Chorus:]
Your true colors are the shades of black
You're the children of evil
You're born to serve the shades of black
Forever

Greed and anger
Turned your souls to black
Now you're addicted
Your mind's too weak
To break the spell of evil

[Prechorus]
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
