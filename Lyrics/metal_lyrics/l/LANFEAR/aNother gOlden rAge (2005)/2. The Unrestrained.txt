I am the unheard voice within
The dying part of yourself
I've tried so hard to turn the tide, so long...

[Chorus:]
Rise and fall is reserved
To the unrestrained

You're heading for a sorry state
Without my faithful guidance
It's time to recollect yourself, again...

[Chorus]

Sometimes I become alive awhile
Don't you know my name?

[Chorus]
