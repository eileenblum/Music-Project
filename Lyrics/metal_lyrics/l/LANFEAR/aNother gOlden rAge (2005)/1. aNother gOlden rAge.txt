We're back again, from the ashes of endlessness
Born to bring life, to free your souls from disgrace
We gave you knowledge, the freedom to unfold yourselves
Angel of mercy, being abused

All I see are foolish mortals
Straying at random thru the dark
Enlightened children
Cursed themselves to live

[Chorus:]
Revolution
Progression you can't prevail
The circle's closing in
To aNother gOlden rAge
Our journey is your reward
We're born to lead you to
aNother gOlden rAge

A waste of time, no rebellion won't change our course
The gods are reborn, behold your fall from grace
Chaotic disorder, transforming to another golden age
An ancient echo overlays the voice

We are taking over with a vengeance
Nothing can ever slow us down
You've passed your chances
Now we seize the reign

[Chorus]
