The one I am used to be
Lives on only in your fantasy
But this is just a lie
My real intentions
Can't assume them all
My trueness would send your mind insane

But every time you fall asleep
I will protect your dreams

[Chorus:]
In the night I'm a shining vision
Saving you from obscurity
But still you dispraise me

Cold eyes are convicting me
Haunting every single step I take
Have I ever caused you harm?
You think I'm different
Cannot understand
The vicious are hunting for your life

[Chorus]

The dark is taking hold of you
I came for your defense

[Chorus]
