I see visions of the past
A reminder of Eden?
So tired of this repeating game
Of being reborn to die again...
A blindfold action takes it's toll
Became immortal

[Prechorus:]
And so I'm living on forevermore?

[Chorus:]
Tired of outliving the ages
Condemned to live forevermore
Tired of outliving the ages
Existing just to try and fail
On and on again

I've seen mankind's rise and fall
Building walls to break them down
A million life times passing by
And all we have learned we knew before
Nothing's remaining

[Prechorus]
[Chorus]

Save my soul
Take me to the promised land
I've paid the price for my mistakes a thousand times
Release me!

[Chorus]
