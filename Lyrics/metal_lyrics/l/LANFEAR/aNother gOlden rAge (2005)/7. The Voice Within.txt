This life seems so unreal
Is this how it's meant to be?
I can't control myself
Something's taken hold of me
So close to heaven
Now I'm burning down in hell
These words of promises
Turn out to be a lie

[Chorus:]
You can't drown the voice within
As long as I'm breathing
You can destroy what I've become
But not the voice within

These eyes won't turn to black
My volition will resist
You can enslave myself
But never make believe
I'm lost in nowhere
Forsaken is my soul
But as long as I'm alive
I won't admit defeat

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
