Somewhere in time
Long ago and far away
A place I've called home
Just a fading memory
I've had it all
But was too blind to see
Now perfection is gone eternally

[Chorus:]
Distant memories of the past
Forever they will last
But you'll never get the chance
To try it once again
Memories of the past
Forever they will last
They are burning on my mind
I can't take away the pain
It will never be the same

A dream goes on
On and on it's hunting me
The place I belong
Just a blurry fantasy
The bridges burn
And it's too late for me
This guilt will live on eternally

[Chorus]
