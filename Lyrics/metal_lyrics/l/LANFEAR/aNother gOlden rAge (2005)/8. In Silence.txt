Why am I here, where are we going
Does this all make sense?
Is the promised guidance just a lie?
Have all born days been fixed without any fail?
Am I just awaken to fall asleep again?

[Prechorus:]
Confusion reigns over mind
Grown away from life?
Is this just deception
Or am I losing sanity?

[Chorus:]
In silence
You won't fulfill your destiny
Start to speak your mind
And change our history
In silence
You can't avert this lunacy
Better face the facts
No wonders never cease

Life is no succession of pure chance
It is just the outcome of facts
But in silence you won't meet
The fate once designed for you
And your arrival was just a waste of time

Will I regret unused chances
Means death the final end?
Is fate at the palm of my hands?
Will all unseen words echo eternally?
Am I returned guilty for all I have never done?

[Prechorus]
[Chorus]
