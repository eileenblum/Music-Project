Stay away, spawn of darkness
Cold eyes betray the intentions
Don't try to threat me, I'll resist you
This soul you will never call your own

Just walk on over
You will never regret
One step to freedom

Back off now! You tax my patience
I won't act against my conviction
These words of wisdom feigned salvation
Won't change my mind anyway

I'll take you over
There's no way to resist
Your soul is mine

[Chorus:]
Transmigration
A vicious mind's reviving
Transmigration
Against the will, against the will

[Spoken:]
Now you will be taken over
Your mortal spirit will be mine

I feel my strength is fading...

[Spoken:]
You can't avert what has been predetermined
Just prepare to meet your fate

I feel my strength is fading away
I'm not myself anymore

I'll take you over
There's no way to resist
Your soul is mine

[Chorus]
