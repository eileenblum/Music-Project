ALONE, in a world of light
ALONE, in the reign of christ
THE BEAST, resting in the deeps of Ade
THE FEAST, I'm preparing

MY HANDS, stained with blood
A CORPSE, bleeding at my feet
THE WIND, rose from the North has dropped
THE SLAUGHTER, now begins

FATHER, You come at last
SATAN, You are here for us
THE BEAST, in the deeps of Ade awakes
THE END, gets near

WE SERVE YOU
WE SERVE YOU
WE SERVE YOU
WE SERVE YOU
