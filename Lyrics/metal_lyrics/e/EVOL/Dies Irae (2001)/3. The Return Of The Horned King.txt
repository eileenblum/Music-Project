Spirit of the Unknown Domain,
Father forgotten by your children,
A long journey You endured,
Through stranger reigns now here
As an ageless Soul upon Stormy Oceans
You travelled to reach your lost sons.

Master, here we are
Waiting, for Your coming
Lost, is our Source
Mislaid, is our Goal

"Oh my King, You're here at last.
I swear by Your Dark Throne my total obedience,
I seal this Oath with my blood.
Make whatever You want of our lives,
They're yours, and so this world".

Finally He arrives to the Place
Where His people live
Rage when He sees another Lord
On His jewelled throne
For years the battle lasts
Leaving only corpses and dust
At the end our King slays His enemy.

NOW HE SITS ON HIS THRONE

Master, here're our Souls
Meaningless, as we born
Slaves, to the Dark Domain
Fighting, for our Black Faith

"Darkness fills the Air. Stench of putrid things in it.
(Ancient) monuments to a forgotten christ are burning,
His followers are hanged on every tree, their flesh is food for the birds,
Their Souls are the dish of our Lord".
