I wander
With my mind
My true strength
My free hand

Find the Way...
Reach the Pain...

Then a day
I realise
Where to dig
Where to find It

"Beyond the Pain I pass,
Senseless to this body,
My Soul is free to wander
In the Realm of Nothingness,
And here I find the Essence,
Banished in a Rubin Tower,

Yes, I find It, but I cannot catch It,
'cause my Body is calling me,

More Pain I need to go
Beyond the Wall of Flesh,

The Gate to a greater Knowledge is not open yet".
