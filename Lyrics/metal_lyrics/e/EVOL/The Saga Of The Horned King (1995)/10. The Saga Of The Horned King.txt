The Saga of the Horned King was recorded in 1995 and released during
the same year by Adipocere Records. This is the debut-CD from EVOL
and contains 10 tracks and lasts 38 minutes. Recordings were done at
Infernal-Blue Train, a very professional recording studio near Venice, Italy.
In this album the listener can found all the enhanced versions of the songs
from EVOL's first demo, The Tale of the Horned King, plus some new tracks.
The music is very atmospheric and the voice of Princess of Disease is really
charming and sensual. The theme proposed by the album is the same
of the first demo, but the attention to the lost Truth is more present.
The Saga of the Horned King can be ordered from Adipocere Records,
B.P. 18, 01540 Vonnas, France.
