[music by Lord of Sorrow; lyrics by Prince of Agony]

I wander
With my mind
My true strength
My free hand

Find the Way...
Reach the Pain...

Then a day
I realise
Where to dig
Where to find It

"Beyond the Pain I pass, senseless to this body,
my Soul is free to wander in the Realm of Nothingness,
and here I find the Essence, banished in a Rubin Tower,
Yes, I find It, but I cannot catch It, 'cause my Body is calling me,
More Pain I need to go beyond the Wall of Flesh,
the Gate to a greater Knowledge is not open yet".
