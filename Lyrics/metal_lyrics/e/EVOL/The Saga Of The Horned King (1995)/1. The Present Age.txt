[music/lyrics by Prince of Agony]

Living in a world of solitude, submerged by falsity and ignorance,
where man live for his own, forgiving his Source,
this is our Age, Godsless, as Nietzsche said,
but Gods will never die, and the time will come,
when our Forger will rise in front of his creatures,
and the Revenge of the Black Souls, banished from this Society,
will take place..."
