[music by Lord of Sorrow, lyrics by Prince of Agony]

I feel You
In my sleeps
In my dreams
When I wake
When I lie...

This cold tower
Called R'lyeh
Is my jail
Feel, oh man
My dark hand
On your doom...

Now I'm blind
Now I'm lost
Show the path
Guide my sight
Where am I?...

Oh poor life being
Leave your body
Feel my presence
Touch my hatred
For your kind
Let me penetrate your life...

"Everything's so vague. Mist covers my spirit; I feel a presence, I hear
his breath, I call,
I cry, silence in his voice. Now I'm lost, no way-out from this land of
loneliness..."

You are mine!
