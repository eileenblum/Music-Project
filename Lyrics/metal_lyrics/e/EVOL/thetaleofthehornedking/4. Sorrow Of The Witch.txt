[music by Lord of Sorrow ; screams by Lord of Sorrow]

Notes:

Drums and bass guitar played on this demo by Lord of Sorrow

The Tale of the Horned was released in 1993 and is the first demo tape from
EVOL. Recorded at Open Studio in Padova, it was self-produced and
self-distributed and has sold 500 copies all over the world. Now it is
sold-out, but the 4 songs that composed it are all included in the Cd The
Saga of the Horned King, released by Adipocere Records in 1995. Lyrics of
this demo deal with the painful conditions of the Noble Souls, bound to
live in a decadent period of History, but with the hope of a forthcoming
New Age, in which Truth will be the Ruler. The Need of Occult, the waiting
for a Guide, the hatred against the present society and the living sorrow
are all well painted by both music and lyrics.
