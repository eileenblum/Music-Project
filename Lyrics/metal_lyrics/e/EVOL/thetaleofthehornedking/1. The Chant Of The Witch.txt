[modern witches' chant; music by Prince of Agony]

Darksome Night and shining Moon
East then South then West then North
Harken to the Witches' Rune
Here I come to call Thee forth

Earth and Water, Air and Fire
Wand and Pentacle and Sword
Work thee now to my Desire
Harken ye unto my Word

Queen of heaven, Queen of Hell
Horned Hunter of the Night
Lend your Power unto my Spell
Work my Will by Magic Rite

Power of Land (and) Sway of Sea
Might of Moon and gift of sun
Do as I will (and) let It be
Chant the Spell and It be done.
