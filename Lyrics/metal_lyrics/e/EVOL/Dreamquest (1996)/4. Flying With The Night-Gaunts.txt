[music by Lord of Sorrow; lyrics by Prince of Agony]

Flying with the Night-Gaunts
Awe and Might
To the Realm of Ice
To the Realm of Ice

Fighting in the Frost
Finding new Allies
For the Reign of Black
For the Reign of Black

High in the Dark
Dance among the Stars
Feast before the War
Feast before the War

Power all around
Dream goes on
This is the true Sign
of Azathoth

Flying with the Night-Gaunts
Fighting in the Frost
This is the true Sign
of Azathoth
