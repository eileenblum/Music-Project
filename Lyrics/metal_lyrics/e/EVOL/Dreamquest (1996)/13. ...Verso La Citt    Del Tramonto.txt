Dreamquest is the newest work by EVOL. It was released in September 1996
by Adipocere Records. Recordings were made always at Infernal-Blue Train,
a professional studio near Venice, Italy. It contains 13 songs,
some taken from the second demo, The Dark Dreamquest part I.
The album last 58 minutes. The songs are based on the tales of H.P. Lovecraft,
especially on the novel Dreamquest of the Unknown Kadath, and on the mythology
of the Cursed Book of the Dead Names, the forbidden Necronomicon.
Dreamquest is a journey through the Land of Dreams, where Truth has been
banished by the Decadence of the Present Age. The landscapes described
are majestic and dangerous. Only the Noblest Souls could fully appreciate
the poetry that lies beneath this CD. Artwork and layout are also very
cared of. Dreamquest is available from Adipocere Records,
B.P. 18, 01540 Vonnas, France.
