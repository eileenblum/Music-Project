TALES ARE WHAT I AM WRITING....
NOT SO FAR FROM REAL THINGS....
METAPHORS AND MYTHS I'M CREATING....
TO COME CLOSE TO THE TRUTH.....
MY ONLY TRUE FRIEND......

MELANCHOLY CAPTURES.....
MY HEART BLEEDING IN PAIN AS I REALISE.....
TRUTH IS FAR AWAY DISPARAGED AND DISGRACED.....
BY A DECADENT AGE.....

FLY UP TO THE WORLD THAT IS NOT.....
USE THE FANTASY IN YOU....
AND FEEL NO REMORSE....
NO MATTER THE COLOUR YOU ARE.....
JUST FOLLOW THE CALL OF YOUR HEART.....
AND SOMETHING WILL COME....

WELCOME TO THE WORLD THAT IS NOT....
WELCOME TO THE REALM THAT SHOULD BE....
LEAVE YOUR HANG UPS BEHIND.....
FREE YOUR SOUL TO FLY.....

MAGIC KINGDOM ARISE.....
JUST NOW UNDER YOUR SIGHT.....
WANDER YOU NO MORE.....
OH....NOBLE SOUL....YOU'RE AT HOME.....

LES LANGUES EN CES LIEUX ONT PEU D'IMPORTANCE.....
CAR ON Y PARLE L'IDIOME DE L'AME SOUVERAINE.....
LE MONDE QUE TU VAS DECOUVRIR MAINTENANT....
EST L'ENDROIT OU LA VERITE DEMEURE A JAMAIS REINE.....

FANTASIA....QUESTA E LA VIA.....
ALLA TUA MAGICA TERRA NATIA....
NULLA V'E CHE POSSA FERMARE....
DI UN'ANIMA NOBLE IL MAESTOSO AVANZARE.....

WITH WONDER AND WITH MIGHT.....
YOUR SOUL IS FILLED WHEN YOU PASS BY....
THE CRYSTAL TOWER WHERE THE QUEEN OF MARILLON AWAITS....
YOUR COMING.....

A YOUNG BOY'S RIDING FAST.....
JUST BEYOND THE BORDER OF STONES HE'S GONE.....
THERE THE ANCIENT ABBEY IS READY TO OPEN ITS GATES TO HARLIN.....

A SHIP IS DOCKING NOW.....
TO A WODDEN MOLE NEAR A FOGGY GROUND.....
SOON ANGHISHA WILL HAVE A NEW PRINCE..... 
FIGHTING FOR THE GLORY OF DARKNESS....  

THE NECROMANCER'S BACK..... 
IN HIS TOWER THAT WAS A TAVERN.....
A NEW MEANING NOW DEATH WILL HAVE....
AS OMEGA PREACHER HAS AWAKEN.....

TALES ARE WHAT I AM WRITING....
NOT SO FAR FROM REAL THINGS....
METAPHORS AND MYTHS I'M CREATING....
TO COME CLOSE TO THE TRUTH.....
MY ONLY TRUE FRIEND......

MELANCHOLY CAPTURES.....
MY HEART BLEEDING IN PAIN AS I REALISE.....
