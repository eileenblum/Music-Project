GREY.... IS MY VEST...A MACE... IS AT MY SIDE...
MY EYES.... ARE THOSE OF THE HAWK....A GIFT.... OF THE FAIRY QUEEN....

FRIENDS.... I HAVE NONE....MY BRIDE.... IS CALLED TRUTH....
LIVING.... TO SERVE THE WHOLE....MY HOME.... IS CALLED.... WORLD...

LA VILLA MIA NATIA....
DALL'ACQUE CIRCONDATA...
PERLA TRA LE PERLE...
ORMAI INABISSATA...
IO SERCO NEL MIO GRIGIO CUOR....

DEL MARE INTERNO AVEA IL PRIMATO...
REGINA D'UN MONDO ASSAI MALATO...
SERENISSIMA LA NOTTE...
ALL'OMBRA DE LEONE...
IO SERBO NEL MOI GRIGIO CUORE....

WARS.... I WILL FIGHT....WHEN..... THE WHOLE WANTS SO...
PEACE.... I WILL SEEK...ONLY WHEN.... I... FEEL.... THE NEED....

RECKLESS.... I AM NOT...MY AIM..... IS THE GOLDEN MEAN...
GREY..... IS MY VEST....MY BRIDE.... IS CALLED.... TRUTH....

THE WHITE INQUISITOR....WILL FOLLOW MY ADVICE....
THE DARK EMISSARY...WILL TRUST THE WORDS I SAID...

THE WHITE INQUISITOR....WILL FOLLOW MY ADVICE....
THE DARK EMISSARY...WILL TRUST THE WORDS I SAID...

HATRED..... AND PASSION.... ARE NOTHING TO ME....
SACRIFICE.... I WILL..... IF I FEEL THE NEED....

TREND.... AND DELIGHT.... I DO NOT SEEK....
BUT KNOWLEDGE.... AND WISDOM..... I WISH...

A NEW AGE IS NEAR AND THE GREY IS OUT THERE...
A WAR HE WILL START...THEN PEACE HE WILL MAKE...
UNTIL HE WILL FIND A NEW KING...

ALL THIS I DO..... WITHOUT EVEN MOVING....
I LET THE HISTORY FLOW.... TOWARDS ITS FINAL DOOM...

HERE I GO...TOWARDS MY MISSION....MY DESTINY....MY LIFE....
RIDING MY HORSE....WRAPPED IN GREY....FOLLOWED BY MY SILVER HAWK...

LIKE A SHADOW..... AMONG SHADOWS I'M OFF....
NO ONE CAN SAVE ME....BUT I CAN SAVE THIS WORLD...
