ONCE UPON A TIME....
IN A REALM SO FAR AWAY FROM HERE....
THERE LIVED A PEOPLE.....
WHO THOUGHT THAT PEACE WAS THE TRUE VALOUR.....

EVERYONE WAS EQUAL TO THE OTHERS....
THERE WERE NEITHER KINGS NOR QUEENS.....
EVERYWHERE ONLY FREEDOM AND WEALTH....
BUT NOBODY WAS TRULY HAPPY THERE....

AND HOW DID THEY FINISH.....
WHERE IS THEIR GLORIOUS EMPIRE.....
THE ANSWER IS UNDER YOUR SIGHT.....
ONLY ASHES AND RUINS....

THEY HAD EVERYTHING....
EVERYONE WAS FREE TO LIVE THE WAY HE CHOSE....
AS A MATTER OF FACT.....
THEY WERE THE MASTERS OF THEIR RAPED EARTH....

EVERYWHERE THEY BUILT UP BUILDINGS...
WITH A RAW GREY MATERIAL WE KNOW NO MORE....
AND THEY FLEW THROUGH THE SKIES....
INSIDE HUGE METAL THINGS LIKE BIRDS....

AND SILENCE WAS BANISHED BY THEIR REALM....
NOBODY RAISED THE HEAD TO THE STARS...
ONLY MATTER THEY WORSHIPPED....
FORGETTING THEY WERE ONLY GRAINS OF SAND...

AND SOON THEY LOST THEIR SOULS....
THEIR GOD WAS CALLED TECHNOLOGY...
AT ITS ALTAR THEY SACRIFIED...
THE FEW LEFT NOBLE SOULS....

AND HOW DID THEY FINISH....
WHERE IS THEIR GLORIOUS EMPIRE...
THE ANSWER IS UNDER OUR SIGHT....
ONLY ASHES AND RUINS....

IN THE TIME OF A MICRON....
THAT GLORIOUS EMPIRE FELL DOWN TO OBLIVION....
ANNIHILATED BY NATURE...
THE COSMIC JUSTICE JUST SPIT ON THEIR TREASURES...

ALL THE BUILDINGS THEY HAD...
WERE PLUNGED DOWN TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL...
AS A MATTER OF FACT....
THEY WERE NO MORE THE MASTERS OF THEIR RAPED EARTH....

AND FINALLY THERE WAS SILENCE...
STARS BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE SKY...
THE ALTARS WERE SWEPT AWAY...
AND THE NOBLE SOULS WERE BACK AGAIN...

THEY HAD EVERYTHING....
EVERYONE WAS FREE TO LIVE THE WAY HE CHOSE....
AS A MATTER OF FACT.....
THEY WERE THE MASTERS OF THEIR RAPED EARTH....

EVERYWHERE THEY BUILT UP BUILDINGS...
WITH A RAW GREY MATERIAL WE KNOW NO MORE....
AND THEY FLEW THROUGH THE SKIES....
INSIDE HUGE METAL THINGS LIKE BIRDS....

I KNOW IT IS SAD...
I KNOW IT MAY SEEM WRONG....
BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET EVER....
THAT WE ARE NO THE ONLY ONES....

AND PEACE IS NOT GOD...
NOR IT IS PROGRESS....
THE WHOLE IS EVERYTHING....
AND WAR IS PART OF IT....

ONLY NOW I UNDERSTAND....
THE MEANING OF THIS TALE....
ONLY NOW THAT I SEE....
THAT SOMETHING EXISTS BEYOND THE VEIL...

HOW STUPID THEY WERE...
SO IMPRISONED IN THEIR TECHNOLOGY....
WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD....
ARISED AFTER THEY WERE NO MORE...
