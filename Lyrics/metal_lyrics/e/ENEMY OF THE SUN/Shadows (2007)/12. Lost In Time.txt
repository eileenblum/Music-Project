Routine skin selection, distinct command.
Violent authorization, rules in hostile hands.
Preaching for understanding, humiliate the next.
Torture, hate, liberate till grave.

Suspect human.
Make up crime.
Welcome victim.
Lost, lost in time.

Kind behavior, smile in camouflage.
Public liberation, reliability.
Soulles investigation, rules made for one side.
Chained in innocence, wrong pride shell suvive.

Suspect human.
Make up crime.
Welcome victim.
Lost, lost in time.
