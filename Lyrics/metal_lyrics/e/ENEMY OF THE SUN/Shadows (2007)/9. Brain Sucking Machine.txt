Hold me quietly under your smoothing arms.
Heal me, encourage me and crush me with all your heart.

Everyday spent with you make me lie and forget!
If this wine dries out, in darkness I'll fall deep...

Living through these monitors I've grown so close.
Nothing inside these walls is real, it's far from truth...

Click the pain away and turn me off right now.
Numbing brain sucking machine, it's you U must devour, devour!

Wipe me out from your memory, I'll bring you nothing good...
Curse me with all your might and show me the unspeakable truth.

Speak about truth, speak about truth.
Speak about truth, speak about truth...

Wipe me out from your memory, I'll bring you nothing good...
Curse me with all your might and show me the unspeakable truth.
