Perfect clarity found in my mind...
Gathered the puzzle in the center of time...
Obvious illusions can tear up the surface...
Inside it there lies zero tolerance...

Raise a wall towards this innocence.
I cannot maintain this dignity.

I never expected to be surreal.
I never expected to see something clear...

Breathing the same metaphorical lies.
Shameless turning them into downwards knives.
Why have you tried to come in between?
What's mine I hold to my chest in my need.

Raise a wall towards this innocence.
I cannot maintain this dignity.

I never expected to be surreal.
I never expected to see something clear...
