Give me hysteria, find the center of my weak spot.
Kill for renewals, and scream the wave up from the oceans...

It really needs to thrive!

Come on light your torch!
Come on light our hopes now!
Come on make our way, to where we belong!
Come on, one explosion! Come on, gathering!
Come on, weak and battered! Reunite!

Anarchy, anarchy, in our hearts but not in actions.
Stick to what's close to us.
All in all that's all we know!

And that's all we care about!

Come on light your torch!
Come on light our hopes now!
Come on make our way, to where we belong!
Come on, one explosion! Come on, gathering!
Come on, weak and battered! Reunite!
