Medicine, medicine on the cell, help it kill the genes away,
genes away with the flaw.
Reconstructing human souls, human souls to avoid,
to avoid the pressure of,
pressure of telling truth from the heart.

(DE-GE-NE-RATE)

We're hacking it, hacking the pain away,
and all the bad memories, memories from the past.
Our goal is to find the cure, purity,
it lies there untouchable giving us, giving us directions...

Synapses, synapses still agree,
we have to kill the sentiments, sentiments which control,
which control the hypnotism, hypnotism in our brains,
making everyone of us,
making us fuckin' dumb, fuckin' numb!

So that is how the story goes.
And the carousel makes us innocent.

Terminate, terminate, liberate! My words come out burning
truth, burning truth to be spread,
all around this masquerade, masquerade genuine, the individuals,
lead the way through the storm, raging storm.

(DE-GE-NE-RATE)

Cannonballs, cannonballs incoming! The battle between right
and wrong, right and wrong, pick your side,
pick your side and evilness, evil in our hearts,
our hearts for all the time, controlling every move,
brick by brick we fall.

Degenerate! Be an ape! Making us, making us be the same empty
shells, going through, going through memory,
memory lane, what was good,
and evil thoughts running wild, in us...

So that is how the story goes.
And the carousel makes us innocent.
