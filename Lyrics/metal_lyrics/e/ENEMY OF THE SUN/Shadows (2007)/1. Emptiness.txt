Create all the vacuums, emotions silent.
Killed and smothered away
Deep down I still feel the heat.
I feed the flames and try to survive...
Trying to get some strength from this never-ending apathy.
It's finally turning against me.

Why can't I feel this? Why can't I feel me...

In this emptiness I keep trying to resurrect
In this emptiness I keep trying to resurrect

Faced all the ghosts from the past.
I never knew they had so many names.
I felt the accusations, in my neck like a parasite...
I chase this guilt on my shoulders trying to make it better again.
But it never helps anything, only weakens me
and gives it more space to grow...

Why can't I feel this? Why can't I feel me...

In this emptiness I keep trying to resurrect
In this emptiness I keep trying to resurrect

In this emptiness I keep on creating it...
