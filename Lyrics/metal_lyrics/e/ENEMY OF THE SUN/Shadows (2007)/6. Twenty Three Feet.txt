Misfits taking charge, why aren't you getting mental?
Spitting all around, why can't you see their agenda?
Big sticks battling through, where do you stand on this one?
Falling authorities, changing the course, now ain't it awesome?

Feel it rising, fighting never ends.
Pressuring silence, drowning us all

Making the same mistakes all again.
back to square one we're gonna go.
Reincarnation of stupity.
This vicious cicle, it will never end

Take a deep breath, take a deep breath
Take a deep breath, take a deep breath

Business, economy, terms we can all forget and
Please our humanity, twenty three feet of pure festivities.
Spinning overdosed, communicating.
Dethroned poverty, ending madness, escalating...

Feel it rising, fighting never ends.
Pressuring silence, drowning us all

Take a deep breath, take a deep breath
Take a deep breath, take a deep breath
