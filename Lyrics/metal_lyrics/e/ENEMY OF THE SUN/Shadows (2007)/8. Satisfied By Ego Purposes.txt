Dying now... to save your coward self!
Faceless... you made me feel like a son of a bitch
Cause no one sane was the cause of your pain

The pious bleed, suffering convictions every way.
Wasted minds, satisfied by ego purposes.

Restore... the goodness in your heart!
Shameless... you made me look like a son of a bitch
Cause no one sane was the cause of your pain

Long days for joyless lifes, locked up in moral chains.
Love masked as discipline, war above anything.

The pious bleed, suffering convictions every way.
Wasted minds, satisfied by ego purposes.

Fear creating fear, death to the ones who disagree
Join the heard of purity, remember to fear everything

The righteous bleed, battle lost and everybody bleeds.
Bleeding through roots of modern hypocrisy.

The pious bleed, suffering convictions every wat.
Wasted minds, satisfied by ego, ego, ego purposes...
