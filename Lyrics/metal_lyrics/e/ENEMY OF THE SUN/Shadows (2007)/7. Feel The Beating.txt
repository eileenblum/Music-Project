Pay the respect to the loved ones and the "gonebefores".
Face the moment of your time and kindly let it go...

Look what you've done! Hold your head down humble...
Look what you've done! Don't you look me in the eyes!
Look what you've done! You don't have any powerful friends!
Look what you've done! We're gonna make you testify!

Shutting my eyes and trying to see a better place.
Thinking of why, while they're hammering this pretty face...

Can you feel the beating rise!?
Can you feel the beating right!?

Same old story happens in these streets every goddamn day.
Officials against the people, it gets more violent day by day...

Look what you've done! Hold your head down humble...
Look what you've done! Don't you look me in the eyes!
Look what you've done! You don't have any powerful friends!
Look what you've done! We're gonna make you testify!

Shutting my eyes and trying to see a better place.
Thinking of why, while they're hammering this pretty face...

Can you feel the beating rise!?
Can you feel the beating right!?

Hear it coming...

Can you feel the beating rise!?
Can you feel the beating right!?
