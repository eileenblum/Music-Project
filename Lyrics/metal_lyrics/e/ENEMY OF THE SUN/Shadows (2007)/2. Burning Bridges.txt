Relook into, your own eyes, cloning madness, monster size!

Are you ready, I want to be surprised, are you coming back?
Are you here yet, now I'm all bored again, could you stay away?

I'm not here for anyone's amusement
and I find it hard to stick with one clear plan...

Demonized agendas control our lifestyle
circling back and forwards, I'm here to have fun...
Ash and concrete's all you will find inside.
Burning bridges again and finding new ones...

Guilded by this immortal wickedness, we will never learn.

Demonized agendas control our lifestyle
