Is that it? What has come into our awareness.
I'm aware of this travesty, I've been this way for far too long.
Eat from the plate, with all temptations a human being provides.
But release this passion out, burning fast behind these eyes...

Rise! Now I want to see you liar rise!!
Rise! Now I want to see you liar rise!!
Rise! Now I want to see you liar ride the sky, now ride the sky!

Rise!

Is this a joke? History books shall be a burning torch.
Senile fools in charge, making us to eat it up.
Still with some hope, in my heart I hold this burning rose.
To await the freedom call or the sound of closing doors.

Rise! Now I want to see you liar rise!!
Rise! Now I want to see you liar rise!!
Rise! Now I want to see you liar ride the sky, now ride the sky!

Rise! Rise!
