Blind the sky with the miracle dope.
Ain't got no time to think about those fools.
So salute the minister of problem solved.
From the dust and soil we urge to grow.

Why do you blame yourself for a million reasons.
You were only practicing his will
Piles of bodies to be paid in silver.
You're my right arm with a pure conscience,
burning heart, burning heart, burning you to dust...

Prices of freedom shoved up with dope missiles.
The pigs of war have done a briljant job.
In keeping crowds so silent in front of lies.
These cruel decisions will haunt our minds...

Why do you blame yourself for a million reasons.
You were only practicing his will
Piles of bodies to be paid in silver.
You're my right arm with a pure conscience,
burning heart, burning heart, burning you to dust...

Who are you asking for some understanding.
You have taken all the rights for that.
We have to build our lives based on conflicts
generation of true fear is here, fear is here, fear is here to stay.
