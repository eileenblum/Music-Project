Tear me open, bleed me dry
Life, a flash behind my eyes

Tryout! tryout! tryout! war! tryout!
Tryout! tryout! tryout! war! tryout!

Can you get your role? in war?
Can you hold your role? in peace?
Can you bear your role? in hell?
Make amends; soon it's too late...

Why choose some sides?
What for, right?
Why prove you're right?
What for, right?

Cards on the table
Choosing sides, right?
Why choose some sides?
What for, right?
