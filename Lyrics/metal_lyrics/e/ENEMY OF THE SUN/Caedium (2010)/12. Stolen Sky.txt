The roots of their greed
Planted in Babylon
Abundance, abundance
In lives of higher class

Ask the ones who cannot reach the sky
It's stolen, it's stolen
From those who can't decide

Can you feel their rage?

Sky is stolen

Access denied

Defiantly shine the signs of infinity
Perverted, perverted
No limits for their need

Always beware
The stockholders of the sky
It's stolen, it's stolen
From those who can't decide
