They sell bones as souvenirs
Handcuffed to their misery and guilt
Tracking a society
That reeks of death
Playing roulette with thieves, with teeth.

Fades the light away...
Takes the light in vain...

They can't take it, take it away!
They can't take it, take it away!
They can't take it, take it away, light out of life, light out of life!!!

Sitting ducks waiting to get hit
With our promises in the grave
It doesn't mean shit... we're hit...

Souls set to explode...
Ready, steady, go...

We can break it, take it away!
We can break it, take it away!
We will break it, take it away, light out of life, light out of life!!!
