Saving illusions â burn after reading!
Scheme of the heroes â taking it to the mountain!
Lying is the mirror â twisting the angle!
From hundred to zero â poisonous crystal fountain!

Vanishing, vanished in tragedy
For the time being,
The state of moral faith.
Last in line â the ones who dominate,
Wiping out themselves unanimously.

Time won't be long, it's gone in a moment
Leaving no trace, no need to exist
It will not lie, the power of mankind
Wants the world burned before they return.

See the sky dividing
Watch the ocean rising
Call for your loved ones
And show them the end is nigh!

Tell them it is time!

Vanishing, vanished in tragedy
For the time being,
The state of moral faith.
Last in line â the ones who dominate
No regrets â the final acceptance.
