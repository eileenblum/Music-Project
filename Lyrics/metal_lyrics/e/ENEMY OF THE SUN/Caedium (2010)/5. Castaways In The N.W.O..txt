I won't fall into their madness
Won't let them tie me up
I disguise myself as a shadow
I will overcome.

Rise! why must we feel the need?
Rise! feel it with grace?
Rise! I bleed integrity!
Rise! whatever it takes!

Why should I lie?
The new world order makes us castaways
And we don't care.

I've seen their imaginary scarecrows
Standing in the shade
Burning them one by one to the ground
And dancing on their graves.
