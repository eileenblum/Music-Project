Teach me about fires
The ones I have seen
Sensing confusion but hey, it's okay...

My mind keeps burning
It's own energy.
Systems degrading, I'm caught up
Caught up in bliss...

I tear a hole to crawl in
Leave my misery behind (for a while)
To gather my desires (in one)
Screaming: I am one!

Transforming to spirits
No longer I grieve
One with this world
And there's plenty to see...

Why suffer, why hate?
