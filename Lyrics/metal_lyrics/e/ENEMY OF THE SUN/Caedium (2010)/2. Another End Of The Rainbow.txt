What did they tell you, that all is well
And that democracy is a friend?
Did they tell you there is friendship among men?
That kind of friendship shoots
A bullet in your head, in your head!

Imprisoned by the humanity of fear
The word of man
Another end of the rainbow
Another day to waste...

Awake in the dreams of horror
Sharing the room with mutual fates
Another end of the rainbow
Another day to waste...

Undoubtedly we eat the bait
Just to see how it tastes
Whether it makes us rich or poor
This is the case;
We are given weapons to defend or to offend.
Another day,
Another end of the rainbow escapes... escapes!

Prosperity, solidarity,
They're all very pretty words...
