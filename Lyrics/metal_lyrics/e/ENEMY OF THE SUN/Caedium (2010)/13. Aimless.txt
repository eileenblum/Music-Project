You're scared of your mind, it's ugly.
You've seen the river,
The stream of blood.
In the river you see yourself
On the top of the wave;
You're all alone and laughing
While the world burns down
Painting the dark skies
Paint it to waste, pain to waste.
You find no channels for your hatred, there's no release....

Afraid to think when you're alone,
Afraid to fall deep in your soul.
Why get such satisfaction
Out of someone's suffering?
No one ever abused you to trigger this.
What makes you walk this path any further?

So point your finger at yourself
You made it happen and now they run
You're aimless, lost in your nightmares
Which you created in your scum.

You're sleeping while you're awake and
You're pulsating for gory deeds
Was it something
That bothered your dreams
To hear the calling, to hear the screams?
So point your finger at yourself
You made it happen and now they run
You're aimless, lost in your nightmares
Which you created in your scum.
