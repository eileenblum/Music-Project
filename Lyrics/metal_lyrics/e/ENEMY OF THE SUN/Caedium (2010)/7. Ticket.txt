Bury your faith in order
To choke your arrogant hate
Your established moral stones are crumbling...
Bury your faith,
Your faith in someone's holier hands
The truth smooths out your abilities...

Scared of what will get lost in this process
Doomed soul is just a concept you possessed.

Blanched teachings make you fear
So that you don't want to die
To raise awareness, getting over this
You have a ticket out...

Dismantled in the air echo
The promises of the past,
What was meant for good
Turned deadly...
Harnessed into lies,
That key will never make you fly,
You got the wrong ticket in your mind...
