Rotting from the inside
Bleeding poison from the mind.

So can you swear this isn't
Too much to handle?
That you'll chase the dragon
You need to strangle?

Swear on your life,
You're going to swear on your death!

Left yourself to be scattered,
For the sake of forgiveness,
The false product of love, of love...

Body full of worm holes
Leaking black infection...

So can you change yourself
To so many faces?
Or can you fool yourself
You still have some friends?

Torn...
Reborn...
