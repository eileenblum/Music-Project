Beneath the ground, buried alive
Not a chance to survive
In a casket, trapped underneath
In the soil, impossible to breathe

You try to scream thinking someone will hear
But no one was in sight, no one even near
Your lungs are filled with dirt, and now you know
That you will die, hidden below

[Chorus:]
To live is to rot
