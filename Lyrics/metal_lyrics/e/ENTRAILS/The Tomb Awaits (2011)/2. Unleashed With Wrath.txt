With hatred as strength towards humanity
Taking actions against mankinds stupidity
Fools! You are nothing but worms
Fools! You live on my terms

Confront me and you will die
As will those passing by
When begun, there's no stopping me
Another bloody massacre complete

[Chorus:]
Fools, you worthless fools
Your blood is on my hands
I need for you to bleed
Now face my unleashed wrath

Remorseless, no regrets
I've killed before, and I'm not done yet
Have no fear of being caught
Others feel empathy, I do not

Have no fear of being caught
I do not feel empathy
In this world of shit

With my massive collection of weaponry
I can act out in supreme devilry
Human victims is my monthly feast
Every time I kill off thirteen at least

A quick stab with the blade of a knife
Warm blood gushing, and draining a life
I love the feeling, the colour, the smell
Do not wish for heaven, I'd rather be in hell

[Chorus]
