Down in the ground, buried alive
Lying six feet below
The coffin's shut tight, my eyes search for light
Anxiety starts to grow

[Chorus:]
Buried alive
Torture and pain
Buried below
Screaming in vain
Buried in dirt
With snakes that slither
Buried and dead
Below

I feel something crawling, an unseen slithering
As the air's becoming thin
Suffering through torture while my life's withering
They're now eating me from within

I can't remember how they got me in here
Buried deep underground
Bitten and trapped, I'm now beyond fear
I will never be found

[Chorus:]
Buried alive
Torture and pain
Buried below
Screaming in vain
Buried in dirt
With snakes that slither
Buried and dead
Beiow I wither

Below I'm dead
