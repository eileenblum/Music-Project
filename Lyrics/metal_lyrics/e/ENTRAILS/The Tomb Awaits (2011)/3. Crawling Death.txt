Crawling up from the graves at night
On the graveyard, away from the light
Thunder and lightning are always near
Death for all to see, death for all to hear

Dweller of the dark
Ghost of the unknown
Crawling in the mist
Dweller of the dark

[Chorus:]
Crawling death

A ghost of the night, from evil born
Ruthless at heart and to darkness sworn
This bringer of death, dwelling in the mist
A ghost unseen from a world beyond this

Dweller of the dark
Ghost of the unknown
Crawling in the mist
Dweller of the dark

[Chorus]
