The sun goes down
Never to rise again
Black clouds fill the sky
Darkness and nothingness

The world goes to sleep
Never to wake again
Ðll hopÐµ is lost
The end of all existence

[Chorus:]
Freezing winds
Earth covered with death
Life has ended eternally
The end is here

No rest in peace
Peace is no more
Everything is dead
Dead to the core

Time to face the end
Death is now certain
All life is lost
Dead and forever gone

The end of all existence
The end of all life
The end of all existence
Nothing is forevermore

Deep endless black
Towards nothingness
The fall of existence
Nothing will ever live again

[Chorus]
