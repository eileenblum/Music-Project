Limbless corpses, scattered around
With flesh and bones as a solid ground
Countless bodies piled up on one another
One is more disfigured than the other

[Chorus:]
Remains in red
Neverending malice
Remains in red
Everlasting horror

A hideous massacre, a massmurder complete
Chopped off heads and severed feet
This orgy of blood, a killing feast
The lives were taken from a dozen at least

Blood is splattered all over the walls
In every room, even down the halis
It's not human, what happened in this place
Severed body parts forming a maze

[Chorus]
