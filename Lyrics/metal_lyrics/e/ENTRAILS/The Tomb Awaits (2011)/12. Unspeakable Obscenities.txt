Night's closing in, darkness draw near
My wicked lust becomes an urge
Relentless beatings, blood I will smear
I've just begun my search

Vile acts, deviant deeds
Carnal desires must be fed
Horrendous killings to satisfy my needs
Remove the organs, then the nead

[Chorus:]
Unspeakable Obscenities
Twisted lusts of the depraved
Unspeakable Obscenities
Merciless and fierce

Here on my killing spree
Nothing's enough for me
I want to see you die
Life fading in your eyes

Decapitation, heading for some more
Mutilation's what I do
Every man to me is a filthy whore
I'll always hack up someone new

[Chorus]

Unspeakable Obscenities
Twisted lusts of the depraved
Unspeakable Obscenities
Merciless and fierce
Unspeakable Obscenities
Furious and remorseless
Unspeakable Obscenities
Vicious and malign
