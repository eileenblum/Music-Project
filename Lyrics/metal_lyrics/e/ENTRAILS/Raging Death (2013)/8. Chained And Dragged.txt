[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

A blow to the head, unconsciousness
Soon to be in deaths caress
You're worthless, your life I will drain
A constant desire to inflict pain

Shackled in chains,
Dragged in pain
Buried alive,
Below you die

I tie you up and shackle your hands
When you're conscious
you'll obey my commands
Entangled in chains, declare me as god
You scream as I drag you through the mud

Life is pouring out of you
soon you'll be gone
Relentless torture,
you'll be dead by dawn

Your wrists are bleeding
from the sharp, cold steel
Hoping that it's all a dream,
but it's for real

Life is pouring out of you
soon you'll be gone
Relentless torture,
you'll be dead by dawn

I roll you down in a newly dug grave
You scream for your life that is too late to save
An alive burial as I fill the grave again
You're gasping for air, but it's all in vain

Shackled in chains,
Dragged in pain
Buried alive,
Below you die
