[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

Strapped to the floor
Lying in gore
Being dismembered and torn
Cuts my skin
Pale, white and thin
With streams of red I'm being fed

I am defleshed

The ultimate fear
Longing for death

I am defleshed

He peels off my skin
With a sinister grin
Defleshed to the bone
Dead within
My eyelids are cut
I can't get them shut
Screaming in fear
As death draws near
Death is now here
