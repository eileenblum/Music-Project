[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

Slaughtered and ripped out of the tomb
Vicious acts, horrid deeds
Diggig up corpses, newly entombed
This is where he feeds

Sadistic maniac, bloodsoaked feast
He comes here every night
To stalk the cemetery's new dug graves
And make sure there's no one in sight

A lust of the wicked, lust for the vile
Repeating unspeakable acts
Obscene and atrocious, lacking remorse
Skulls of the humans now cracked

Beyond the living, beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
Beyond the living, beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces

This murderous butcher, with sinister intent
Can't resist his nocturnal urge
To haunt the graveyard for new to maim
A brutal and repugnant search

Sadistic maniac, bloodsoaked feast
He comes here every night
To stalk the cemetery's new dug graves
And make sure there's no one in sight

Beyond the living, beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
Beyond the living, beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
Rot in pieces - dead!
