[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

To mankind we're an enemy sworn
Evil madness since we were born
Formed an army, a militia of blood
To bring humanity back into mud

In the night, through the mist we appear
An inmense legion, you tremble with fear
With hatred and anger we fight
One thousand deaths on this unholy night

Death league
Thirsty for blood
In league with death
Thrown in the flood
Death league
Slaughtered and torn
In leaque with death
In hell reborn

In the darkest abyss
Beyond the rotting world
The demons of death arise
Everything is doomed tohell

Bludgeonous slaughters, blood we'll spill
It's all about how many people we kill

Cursed to an eternal fall
Obsessed by cruelty, death to all
Night of scorn, the final hour
The darkness is ours to devour

Death league!

Our only goal
is to depopulate the earth
Because mankind
is simply without worth

Burn it all, burn it to the ground
Until nothing but dust is to be found
Kill 'em all and all shall see
We are the essence of grotesquery

Death league
Thirsty for blood
In league with death
Thrown in the flood
Death league
Slaughtered and torn
In leaque with death
In hell reborn
