[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

Murderer, killer, a sinister fiend
I have no remorse for my wicked deeds
With morbid intent, I aim for the head
Unleashing the hammer, I want you dead
I let it sway back and forth to get you off guard
Pounding and slamming my hammer of doom
I won't stop 'til I've bloodsoaked the room

Bloodhammer, Pounding of doom
Bloodhammer, Morbid kills

Bludgeoning, out of control,
a relentless beating
My favourite choice of weapon,
I like the repeating
I want it to look like a dozen were slayed,
like a massacre took place
To show my constant disgust for mankind
and the whole human race

Bloodhammer, Pounding of doom
Bloodhammer, Morbid kills

Bloodhammer, Hammer of doom
Destructive force, Into the dead

Obliteration, annihilation, mass destruction
Hammering, painstaking, a lethal swing
So malicious, and atrocious, raw and vicious
Brutalize, pulverise, a quick demise

I kill your face, breaking your bones
Samshing your skull, pounding your flesh

Cold, heavy steel in my hand, swinging in wrath
I am on a neverending, unstoppable, murderous path
A crack in your skull, multiple wounds, made with blunt force
You will die painfully, covered with bleeding sores

Bloodhammer, Pounding of doom
Bloodhammer, Morbid kills

Bloodhammer, Hammer of doom
Destructive force, Into the dead
