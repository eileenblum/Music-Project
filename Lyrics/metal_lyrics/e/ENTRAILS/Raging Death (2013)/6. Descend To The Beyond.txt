[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

Death in the air, death in the ground
Lifeless eyes staring in the dark
This eerie night, this freezing night
Where evil has left it's mark

Beyond the damned
I'll soon be one of them
Beyond the damned

Cemetery malice, alive tonight
Haunted graves, invisible guests
Beneath the ground, where evil lurks
Where mist and stench infest

Beyond the damned
I'll soon be one of them
Beyond the damned

Descend to the beyond
Away from the tomb
Feeling no pain
Drowned in my own flesh
Drained from blood
Rotten and cold

I come here at least once a week
And lie next to the ones that reek
Open caskets, filled to the brim
I like to study them from limb to limb

Beyond the damned
I'll soon be one of them
Beyond the damned

Descend to the beyond
Away from the tomb
Feeling no pain
Drowned in my own flesh
Drained from blood
Rotten and cold

Descend to the beyond
Away from the tomb
Feeling no pain
Drowned in my own flesh
Drained from blood
Rotten and cold
