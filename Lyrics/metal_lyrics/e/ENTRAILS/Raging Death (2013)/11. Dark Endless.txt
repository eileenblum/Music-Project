[Vinyl And Digipak Bonus Track][originally by Marduk]Darkness is complete
Oh so it burns
Dark endless forests
Has poisoned my blood

Overshadowed by ancient evil
My bones are black from sadness
My soul is cold as ice
I will dwell in hell

Dark endless forests
From another age
Darkness it shall be
Not a sign of light

No heaven so bright
But hell burned a light
Souls screaming out loud
Let us fucking die

Dark endless forests
From another age
Darkness it shall be
Not a sign of light

Blackened stars fall from the sky
To rule again in satan's empire

Father - I'm your seed
Forever you I will feed
