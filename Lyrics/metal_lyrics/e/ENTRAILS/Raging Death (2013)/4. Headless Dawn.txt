[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

Morbid ways, foul decay
Wicked and deranged
They are always asking for it
In this chopping pit

Sadistic ways, foul dismay
I decapite and maim
Bloodsoaked, brutal deeds
On their blood I feed

Dismemberment, like an ever flowing stream
Of blood, I am not what I seem
I take their heads in frantic wrath
Entombed they'll be on my killing path

I hack in violent ecstasy - raging death
On this day of lunacy - your last breath
Fanatic and insan - pure evil hate
I live for their pain

Headless dawn
Blood will flow
Bloodred dawn
Heads will roll

Headless dawn
This is what I do, I'll never quit
Into the grave, bit by bit
Headless dawn
