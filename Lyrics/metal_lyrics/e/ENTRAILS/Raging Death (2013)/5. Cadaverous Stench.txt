[Jimmy Lundqvist / Jocke Svensson]

Daily terror, torture without end
Infernal malice, spit and offend
Stack 'em up, a hideous pile
Prepare the satisfaction with acts so vile

Infernal horror, pain without end
Men and women, all must attend
Deadly poison, coming from an opening
Slowly permeating, death it will bring

Sinister torture
Cadaverous stench
Sinister death
A pile of flesh

Hidden chambers specially built for me
Inhaling poison, never to be free
Malicious cause that no one can abide
No escaping this crawling death called pesticide

Sinister torture
Cadaverous stench
Sinister death
A pile of flesh

Inside these walls, survival isn't optional
Every breath is merely chemical
Scratching the doors, fighting for air
Screaming for mercy, which isn't there
