Dying and helpless, punishment
The life is silent as the grave
The attempt is doomed to failure
To be in mortal fear
Obituary notice fatally massacred
To the visions of the fatal truth
Stream in feelings heavenly meanings
On the sentence of death

Victim of hell always grotesque
The holy master confesses
By the mortal dread
The angel saved your breath

Euthanasia calling for you
Autopsy flesh digging pain
Euthanasia calling for you
Darkness has come to judge your death

Dead by help dead by dawn
Entrance to hell
Rotten by cancer
Mystery disaster
Freedom of pain
Be in the death throes
Climb up the Satan's stairs
To preach with the dark side
