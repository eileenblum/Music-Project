Come to me now
Don't be afraid
Death's cold dark
Obey my command

Awaiting execution
Destiny has arrived
Slaves in this world
Listen to me

[Chorus:]
Torment - Pain
Massacre - Soul
Morbid - Rituals
Total death

Kill the innocent ones
Darkness will eat their souls
Make it look like a suicide
And make my dream come true

Beware of the tormentor

They deserve to die
Paralyzed with pain
Bones break, they must crawl
I give pain to all

Corpses are molested
Feast on flesh and blood
Mortal screams fills my ears
As they die

[Chorus]
