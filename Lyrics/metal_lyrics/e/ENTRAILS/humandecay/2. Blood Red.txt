I am your majesty
Noise of death I'll hear
Never change the course
I have your soul of death
Diiiiieeeeeeeeee

Cut by knife
I scream like hell
Blood red I spill
Raining blood
I should never lied
Blood red I spill

I am your worst nightmare you ever had
I scream in your head your blood turns red
I call you in the darkest death
When you have arrived you can't find back
