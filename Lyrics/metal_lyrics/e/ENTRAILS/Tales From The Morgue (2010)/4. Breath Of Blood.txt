I know the time
When you grow up
Time has not changed
After your parents' death

Time after that
You were paralysed
No family to go to
Took care of your self

Death can see
More than you know
Death can strike
Wherever you go
Your parents they died
By force they were killed
Blood in throat breath of blood

Now in this time
A big and a powerful world
You still remember
Your parents' death
