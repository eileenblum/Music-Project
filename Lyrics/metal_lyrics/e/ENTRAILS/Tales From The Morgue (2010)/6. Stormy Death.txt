Clouds in the skyRain pouring downProtect your headLightning strikes again Stormy weatherBlood on leatherDeath is risingBlood is flowing Piles of flesh and bonesRipped off by the deadAwakened by the stormYou're now without head We are all helplessWeather have such powerBlack clouds are formingThey want you dead Cloud dark and uglyThunder can be heardGive me your best shotGoodbye bastards
