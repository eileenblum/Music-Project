The story was toldThe crypt was oldWe have a confessionThe evil obsession Evening in a tormenting cryptChains around your neckFood once a week lifetime to dieDead flesh flowing out of your ass Reborn to societyCrawl with anxietyPain from lost mindNo one can find Death and smelly corpseBuried in the wallsGraveyard in the gardenTheir souls shall be reborn
