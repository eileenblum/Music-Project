The bringer of plague, the bringer of death
A fist in humanity's face
Unleashing the wrath, save your last breath
Condemning the human race

Inverting the cross, the image of Christ
The sign of weakness and lies
The world is aflame, evil will rise
Torment will be your demise

You shall fall
The plague is spreading fast
Death to all
The triumph of death at last

No help from your god, your feeble lord
Evoking the evil unseen
Summoning of the demonic horde
A genocidal war machine

Your god has failed, he is now dead
Killed by the arch nemesis
Death is a fact, blood's flowing red
Satan will take what is his

The curse of death
A swarm of plagues
You will be dead
None will survive
The curse of death
You will be dead
You are cursed
Die!

Darkness ascends, black clouds draw near
Only ashes remain
The end of the world, it's finally here
Suffering and pain

Mankind is but a memory now
No life, no laughter, no light
Darkness will reign, now take a bow
Everything's transformed into night
