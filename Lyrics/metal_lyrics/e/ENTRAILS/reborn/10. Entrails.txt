Shadows, the dark place in chaos
Entrails, the waste from the flesh
Dry blood, red as it can be
Disintegration, decay from rotten bones

Entrails... a tasty entrail
Flesh and blood
Dinner for two
Show me some death

Autopsy, the final way to die
Raw meat, taste the smell of fear
Coffin, silence in the grave
Die...

I am the slayer
You are the victim
All shall face the death
Soon you will die

Graveyard... The end of destination
Undefeated soul... Anger for mankind
Worn out... To stand by your own
Immortality... I shall rise again
