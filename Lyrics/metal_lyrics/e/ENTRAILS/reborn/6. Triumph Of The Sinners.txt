Sinners shall burn
To a melting stuff
Great kingdom shall rise
Cause of sinners doom

Memories from that time
Slowly rot away
No one misses their friend
Cause sinners shall burn in hell

Make some noise
Scream and exterminate
Violence to hell
The sinners are born again
Ruin the world
Fight the life
Of remaining crowd
Your doom is near

For nothing the pain ends
Be drunk to kill again
So be to the great pain
And rise from the grave again

The enemy will get away
And stand gone forever
No threat to the people
The peace finally arrives

Fighting death to death
To create some life
Life who shall win
Against the dark hell

Flowing power makes
Me to win at last
Death shall be reborn
Triumph of the sinners
