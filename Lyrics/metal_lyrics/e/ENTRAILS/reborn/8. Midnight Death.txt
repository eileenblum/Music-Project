Being all alone at midnight
Walking through the cemetery
The moon in full, it freaks me out
The earth begins to quake
I turn my head around my shoulder
And see a hand coming from the ground
Thinking what the fuck is going on?
The gate is locked, I am trapped

[Chorus:]
The dead are walking at the cemetery
Hungry for flesh and thirsty for blood

A thick fog of rotten stench
I try to hide from the shadows of death
They seek for human souls
Empty my head and scream for my life
I had to make my escaping clear
How to run, how to hide
Grabbed a pole and began to smash
Their heads cracked as they fell to the ground

I was killing zombies that night
Dead things drooling for my flesh
What the hell woke 'em up?
Can I somehow make them die?
I was running, I was hiding
Looking for a thing to do
Found a gas can, spread the fuel
Lit a fire and made them burn
