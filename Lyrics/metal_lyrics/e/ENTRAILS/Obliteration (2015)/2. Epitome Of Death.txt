Wings of darkness, embrace me.
For I am chosen, I am set free.
Killing for pleasure is what I do.
Death, you quench my thirst, I don't care who.

Satisfaction is what I need, a morbid fix.

Murder, my only urge is to murder.
I feel empty without murder.
It makes my life complete.
I am the epitome of death.

Murder, my only urge is to murder.
I feel empty without murder.
It makes my life complete.
I am the epitome of death.

The fear in their eyes, as I sharpen my knife.
Tears and screams, as I take their lives.
There is something inside me, a growing lust.
The relentless urge has become a must.

Doomed to a hollow life, I murder for kicks.

Murder, my only urge is to murder.
I feel empty without murder.
It makes my life complete.
I am the epitome of death.

Murder, my only urge is to murder.
I feel empty without murder.
It makes my life complete.
I am the epitome of death.
