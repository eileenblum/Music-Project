Thunder and lightning in the sky.
Armageddon, time to die.
The world is deserted, end of all.
In the eye of the storm, mankind's fall.

In the eye of the storm, mankind's fall.

Bonestorm, crushed by the Bonestorm.
Skulls in the Bonestorm, killed by Death.
Bonestorm, storm of bones.

Bonestorm, crushed by the Bonestorm.
Skulls in the Bonestorm, killed by Death.
Bonestorm, storm of bones.

Like a spiteful tornado it will ravage.
This murderous storm so savage.
Devastating lives and lands.
The whole world in it's hands.

The whole world in it's hands.

Embracing Death to it's own.
Collecting corpses, skulls and bones.
Terror from the sky, terrorizing Death.
The world is taking one final breath.

Spewing bones and skeletal remains.
A gravelike vortex, increasing gain.
Like a living cemetery, bound for decay.
Striking with vengeance, the brutal way.

Striking with vengeance, the brutal way.

Bonestorm, crushed by the Bonestorm.
Skulls in the Bonestorm, killed by Death.
Bonestorm, storm of bones.

Bonestorm, crushed by the Bonestorm.
Skulls in the Bonestorm, killed by Death.
Bonestorm, storm of bones.
