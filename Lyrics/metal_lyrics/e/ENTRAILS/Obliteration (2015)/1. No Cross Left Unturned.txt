[Dedicated to Jeff Hanneman (January 31st, 1964 - May 2nd, 2013)]

Burning churches down to ashes.
Showing no mercy, tonight.
Igniting the night with flames of wrath.
Fire is my guiding light.

Until there's no cross left unturned.
This is the time to make them burn.

Inverting the cross, the hoax of christ.
Evil has no boundaries.
I yearn to burn, to kill the lies.
Destroying them, piece by piece.

For now there's no cross left to turn.
I am the one who makes them burn.
This is the path of no return.
Time to burn!

Until there's no cross left unturned.
This is the time to make them burn.

Until there's no cross left unturned.
This is the time to make them burn.

Catacombs filled with blood, boiling the holy from within.
I am the resurrected, born of fire and sin.

For now there's no cross left to turn.
I am the one who makes them burn.
This is the path of no return.
Time to burn!

Burning and killing and slaying.
Ripping and tearing and screaming.
Stabbing and slashing and thrashing.
Beheading and hunting, then hell.
Igniting and laughing and watching.
Maiming and chopping and bleeding.
Destroying and crushing, them dying.

Until there's no cross left unturned.
