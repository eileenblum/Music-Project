Death is now upon me, I inhale it's might.
Atrocities by hand, turning day to night.

Destroy the human filth!
Slicing up the flesh!

The Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.

Grotesquery inside my head, victims I abduct.
Take them to a hidden place, they do as I instruct.

Peeling off the skin to a disgusting mesh.

The Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.

Tie them up, gag their mouths, my scalpel shine.
Warm blood is dripping now from their bodies that are mine.

Destroy the human filth!
Slicing up the flesh!

The Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.

Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.
Inhuman bliss.
Into the grip of the Grotesque.
