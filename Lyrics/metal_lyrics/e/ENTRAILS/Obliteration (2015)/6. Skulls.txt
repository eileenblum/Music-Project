Trapped in devastation, the afterglow of war.
Human termination, revel in flesh and gore.
Visions of bestial warfare, morbid minds align.
In the burning corpses glare, we killed what we could find.

Skulls!
Into the Death.
Skulls!
The final path to the beyond.
Skulls!
Into the Death.
Skulls!
The final path to the beyond.

Pulverized humans on the ground: Killed, beaten, gone.
In times of war and hellish gore, blood fills the dawn.

The end of all is now here, life does not exist.
Forever dead eternally, forgotten in the mist.
Into a deathlike silence, as the wood burns.
War and blood, spite and rage, for Death I yearn.

Skulls!
Into the Death.
Skulls!
The final path to the beyond.
Skulls!
Into the Death.
Skulls!
The final path to the beyond.
