Into the darkness, a gaping hole.
Beneath the ground, Death will unfold.

It's been here for ages, a trap for mankind.

Abyss of corpses, a stench piled up.
Now and forever, it will never stop.
Abyss of corpses, death and decay.
The smell of a carcass is here to stay.

Bodies piled up, abysmal genocide.
The stench, the rotten smell.
The reeking ones that died.

Thousands of corpses swallowed by the abyss.

Abyss of corpses, a stench piled up.
Now and forever, it will never stop.
Abyss of corpses, death and decay.
The smell of a carcass is here to stay.
