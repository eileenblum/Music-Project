Caught in total sickness from centuries of old.
Born in utter darkness, Death will now unfold.

Beyond the flesh, beyond the flesh.
Hell is coming from far beyond the flesh.

Spreading like a leper that's crawling down your spine.
Death and hell and vomit, all of them entwined.

Beyond the flesh, beyond the flesh.
Hell is coming from far beyond the flesh.

Plague is now upon us, dead you soon will be.
When darkness is unchained in this pestilent spree.

Black Death rules the earth, blood becomes the soil.
Pale cadavers everywhere, their skin begins to boil.

No sign of life, all is gone by a leprosy.
The earth is raped by the stench, darkness it will be.

Beyond the flesh, beyond the flesh.
Hell is coming from far beyond the flesh.
