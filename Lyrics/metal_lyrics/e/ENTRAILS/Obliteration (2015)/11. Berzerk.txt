[Bonus Track]I crave the dead, to death thy bled.
In carnage, my crimson rebirth, knee deep in gore. 
I'm craving more, to wipe the humans off the earth.

Berzerk, I lust for Death.
Berzerk, massacres ahead.

Berzerk, I lust for Death.
Berzerk, massacres ahead.

Drenched in blood, just let it flood.
I maim and hack and saw and kill.
Rivers of red pours from the dead.

Fanatic frenzy, relentless wrath.
A world in blood, Hell's aftermath.

Berzerk, I lust for Death.
Berzerk, massacres ahead.

Berzerk, I lust for Death.
Berzerk, massacres ahead.

I crave the dead, to death thy bled.
In carnage, my crimson rebirth, knee deep in gore. 
I'm craving more, to wipe the humans off the earth.

Fanatic frenzy, relentless wrath.
A world in blood, Hell's aftermath.
