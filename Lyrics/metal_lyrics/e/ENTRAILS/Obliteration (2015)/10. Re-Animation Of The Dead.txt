Night of a morbid death lurking in the dark.
Awakening of the dead, the Devil's mark.
From the graves they rise in the midnight hour.
Cemetery terrors, lives they devour.

Into town, a bloody spree.
Killing everyone in sight.

Re-animation, the dead arise.
Hell made flesh, re-animation of the dead.

Re-animation, the dead arise.
Hell made flesh, re-animation of the dead.

They hunt and kill tonight, these wretched dead.
A bestial feast, total Hell ahead.

Creeping Death rising from the grave.
Like a rotten mist, lives will be craved.
Evil embodied, re-animated dead.
Horror made flesh to raze and tread.

No one will survive this unholy night.

Re-animation, the dead arise.
Hell made flesh, re-animation of the dead.

Re-animation, the dead arise.
Hell made flesh, re-animation of the dead.

They hunt and kill tonight, these wretched dead.
A bestial feast, total Hell ahead.
