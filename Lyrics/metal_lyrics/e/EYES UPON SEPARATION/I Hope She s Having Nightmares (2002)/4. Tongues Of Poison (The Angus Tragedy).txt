intrigued...
how could this be
such a residual process
fountains of hope fraught with despair
look away, children
look away
his beauty hidden deep in fraud
plagued
plagued by mockery
affluent in nothing
how I long to be complete
with you I am
I am you
released
my will has been put to death
I am nowhere
I am nowhere but everywhere
casually remind me pointless instruction
look away, children
look away
I will look nevermore
I see...
