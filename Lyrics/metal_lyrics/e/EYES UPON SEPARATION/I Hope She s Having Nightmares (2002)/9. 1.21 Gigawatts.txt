rain...
render my surrender
replenish, refurnish
the house was occupied
there is no seeing through it
her vision was blurred
wait lets start over
it was all a game
I lost
she took my peace and ran
a far cry from pestilence...
on angels wings it descended
I thought I was wrong
why couldn't I see it for what it was?
a twisted web lies behind every page
how many times will I weep this song?
how many lies will I hide behind?
parting with such dementia
my sweet bathsheba...
forgotten...
