my darling
you're an angel
you're a shining star
and baby, you turned my whole world cold when I made
you smile
so pull these lifeless fingers from this wasted heart
full of wasted words that I could never tell you
look away as my face turns to stone
I swear I felt the breath of an angel in your voice
and I swear we could be beautiful
my love
look away as my heart turns to stone
forever wrapped in splinters
and the bruises of my every breath
my darling
hold these tears and remember me
as I join the clouds
forever wrapped in a dream of you
