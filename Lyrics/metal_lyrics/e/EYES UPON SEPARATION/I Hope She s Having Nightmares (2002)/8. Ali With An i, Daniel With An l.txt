love is lost
swallow the hatchet
I'll bury these feelings deep in the back of my throat
where it's safe
where they can't kill me
she walks along the flames
she walks on the softest clouds
too high for me to touch her
too high for her to hear my voice
I'll bury these words in the back of my throat
and I'll bury these feelings under my skin
where they can't kill me
she walks along the flames
where she can't get burnt
she walks where it's safe
she walks away from me
