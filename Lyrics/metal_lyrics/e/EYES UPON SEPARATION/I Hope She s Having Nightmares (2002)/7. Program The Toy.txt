devour her soul
dehumanize
paint a picture of plastic perfection
leave the shell empty and lost
leave the scared child inside screaming and dying
innocence bleeds away
we're just as guilty...
exploit her
reevaluate her worth
you pigs
I hope your eyes rot out
fix them on your creation
your Barbie doll bombshell
the child cries inside
the child dies inside
a portrait of lust absorbs callous stares
through the eyes of jackels
devour her soul
dehumanize
strip away her worth
