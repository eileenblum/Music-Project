all that was green has withered to nothing
a blackened sky suffocates me
where is my rainbow?
where are my flowers?
the roses have all turned black
my heart withers as the autumn leaves
it's so much easier to watch them die
(I want to watch you die)
all that I know
all that I love
all that I long for
you'll just kill me in the end
my summer grows cold
I try to resurrect your face with my breath
I can taste the salt of my own tears
I cup my hands in hopes to catch a drop of what remains
I couldn't reach you
tomorrow holds no hope
the sun has set for good
passion is a distant memory
leave me to die
leave me to die with the seasons
