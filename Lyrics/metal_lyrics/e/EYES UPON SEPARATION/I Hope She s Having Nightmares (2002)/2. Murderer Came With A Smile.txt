I won't love you this time
I see your face shining in my tears
bleeding through my skin
my wrists are cut away
I won't be able to look you in the eyes
I won't be able to smile
tonight the stars are gonna shine on my corpse
I want the face of an angel
I want to wear the wings that will carry me away (from you forever)
my corpse is gonna shine tonight
with all the stars in your eyes
you won't see
you don't see me
I've wasted myself on you
