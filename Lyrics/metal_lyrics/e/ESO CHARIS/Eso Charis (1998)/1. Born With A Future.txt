Born with a future of our past illuminate 
And fall against the grain be transformed 
Reborn is the one whose been called not forced under to fall 
Fall to the merciless fire cut off and be set apart will you seek shelter 
When the world is convinced that you deserve to die
For your love inside your heart seeks pleasure will you be grasped by it 
Or captive will it held by him forever 
When deceptive thoughts come into mens minds 
And aim them at you what will you do accept and dismiss truth as lies or
reject 
And be pulled to an end for this the cause lovelorn Jesus will 
I have I the product of denial is a reoccurring thought 
Before your very eyes a solution forms take the mantle thats been worn it
sounds better than 
The truth pass it on it wont go away the awareness of the absence 
The fear of departure knowledge of real truth its inside the burning the gaping
hole 
That makes your tear stained face but 
He will wash it away dont be deceived on this day only righteousness will
stand 
This message is as love and to you given a letter of hope because I love youI
love you
