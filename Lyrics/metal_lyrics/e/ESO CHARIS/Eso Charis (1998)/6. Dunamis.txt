God, we thank you and we lift up our requests.
Holy spirit manifest.
Give us the words to minister.
Open minds, soften hearts, in Jesus name.
Lost souls.
I want to tell you 'thank you', Jesus.
People your eyes are blind.
Make new your hearts.
(Throw away selfishness, works won't save.)
My God help us to be bold, amen, pointless, worthless, lifeless life.
(This world and it's lusts will fade away)
There's nothing you can to do to stop it, dunamis.
Power (You can't stop it dunamis) lost souls.
("This burning feeling inside of me,
I hold this blood in my hands, it runs over exceedingly.
I shall not break my stance.")
Satan we expose you, you're a liar.
You're a liar.
Satan we rebuke you in the name of Jesus.
