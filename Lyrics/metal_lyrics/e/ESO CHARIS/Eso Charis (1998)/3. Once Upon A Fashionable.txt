Reflection of an almost, almost what you want.
Blending in is what's different.
Jesus loves your heart.
It doesn't matter what you wear or what you like.
You forgot to rember.
Who decides the fashion law?
Who holds the standards on who we should be?
Who's right or wrong?
We're all welcome here.
Christ is the answer.
You're wasting your time.
Keep focused on not what is seen but what is unseen, it is eternal.
Fashion statement.
Who will be the judge?
You've lost your found self.
Follow Him.
