You're swimming, going under, your learning shatters.
Screaming from destruction.
Your filters clogged.
I tried to warn you, I tried to tell you of God.
You wouldn't listen.
You just spit on me.
To drink of an empty cupthat cost you so much.
Jesus' cup is free, and it runs over.
I will follow Jesus Christ.
I really can't understand why something good always has to die.
Happy fleshly.
On the bottom, one direction...up.
You could skim, you could skim.
You could be in victory.
Your status of origin, it really matters.
What's your purpose?
What's your goal?
Where's your answer?
Where's your soul?
Your season ends in suffering.
Skimmers, skimmers, guilt.
(Find your purpose, His true and real purpose.
Return o' wandering stars from darkness.
Return o' daughters og injustice and sons of hate.
The time is now and this is the hour.)
It's not over yet, you still have time.
Bow down to your Father, your creator...GOD.
