I'm the adulterous bride. 
The land that's been parched, and pastures are withered. 
I am the desert baron. 
My head, a spring of water, 
My eyes a fountain of tears. 
For the slain of myself. 
I've made my friend with the world. 
And I've made my God my enemy. 
Lust has conceived, birth to sin. 
Sin is full-grown, gives birth to death...to death 
My name is Judas Iscariot and 
I have given up my inheritance. 
And my feet are swift to she'd blood for thirty silver coins and this noose. 
My God what have I done?
