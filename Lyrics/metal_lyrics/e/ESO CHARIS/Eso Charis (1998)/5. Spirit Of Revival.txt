Ressurection fall on us, ressurection roll over us.
This is our reality to pursue your hand.
Righteousnes, you arm us with your strength.
We come trembling from our strongholds.
Understand, discern the spirits.
This is our quest to take over enemies, taken back what's already ours.
Our conquest.
Holy spirit, take this land and God please crush all hate, overtake our hearts.
Lord, let your love pour down harder.
So let your love pour down harder.
Let the rivers run wider.
Let the winds carry further.
Let the fire burn brighter.
Spirit of revival.
