Rejoice
This celebration
The blind god smiles
At us tonight

Resounding with laughter
The night is alive
A night to remember
For those who have died

Spirits have risen
To gather around
The gifted child
With angel s eyes
Shunned by the living
Loved by the dead
He s in league with the devil
Or so they say 

Resounding with laughter
The night is alive
A night to remember
For those who have died
The flotsam and jetsam
Of the other side
The ragged and torn 
The pale and forlorn 

The ragged and torn 
The pale and forlorn 

Fearless he moves
Among shadows and tombs
In the dead of the night
By the light of the moon
For he s the boy who dances with ghosts
