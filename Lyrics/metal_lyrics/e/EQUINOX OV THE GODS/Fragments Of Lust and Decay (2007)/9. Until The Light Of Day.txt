My treasure, I can smell your fear
You know you're not alone
You pray your lord your soul too keep...
Well, he may when I am done
Where's the precious god now I ask thee
I do not fear thy crucifix

Your life is mine for me to take
To feast upon at night
Like a cup of nectar, sweet
I'll drink you with delight

Oblivion takes you in her arms
For a dance throughout the night
Whirling around in a crimson gown
You stare into the devils eyes
Embraced by dreams and shadows smooth
You slowly fade away
Into the dark and silent void
Of death to there remain

Just another dream in crimson
For the slaughter another sheep
A god awakes
To let you die alone
And deep within the dreamers tower
The ball continues for another night
'till the light of day
And silence reclaims its throne
