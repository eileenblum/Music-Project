By my side you spent the nights
Weaving dreams to last forever
Forging memories to last
Beyond the moment
Beyond the night
But we were cursed
To live the eternal darkness
Beneath the moon
We will defy
the Wrath of angels

Cursed by fate we fell from grace
The word was ripped out from our chests
We saw the gates of heaven fade away before our eyes
(we said goodbye)
As our sun went down for the last time
We awoke entombed in separate graves
Beneath the moon
We will defy
the Wrath of angels

To embrace your innocence
I m longing for
The taste of nectar
Sweet
From your lips
A word
A song
Of joy
A kiss...
...Of moonlight
Bright
Sparkling eyes
A tender touch
In a dream
For me
To see
How it could be...

In your eyes
A glimpse of light
Of paradise
Burning bright
Still I see
Before me
How it could be
For you
For me

A time I recall before our fall
From heavens grace and golden halls
(When) I mesmerized adored your eyes
the most precious jewels on the starlit sky

In a dream I saw
how the wolf his raven sought

Beneath the moon
in snow and frost
He sang his songs
of grief and loss

The wrath of angels
tore us apart
The wrath of angels
bleed my heart

The wrath of angels
