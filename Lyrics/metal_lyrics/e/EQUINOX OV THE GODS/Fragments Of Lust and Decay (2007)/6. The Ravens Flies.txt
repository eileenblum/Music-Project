Angel, kiss goodbye the shadows
A last farewell to the hollowed one
For my dead soul a revival
As you lift me high up from the ground

In your arms I felt the fire
A blood red passion burning bright
In your eyes I saw a reason
And the past fade out of sight

A last kiss, goodbye
I'm leaving
A last kiss
For the joy
The devil smiled
As you spread your wings
Behold!
The Raven flies...

I left the world
Dead and buried
In the filthy memories
Of life itself
Which I ignored
While I was breathing
Hypocrisy

Dark eyes filled with silent wonders
Devoured my soul and made me see
Black wings laced with silver moonlight
Embrace my heart through an endless dream

In your eyes
Beyond our dream
Take me high
Spread your wings
The Raven flies
