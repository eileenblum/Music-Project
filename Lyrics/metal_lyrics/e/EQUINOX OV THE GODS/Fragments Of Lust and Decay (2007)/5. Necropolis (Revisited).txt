I see no stars in the sky
No clouds are passing by
I see no sun nor moon
Necropolis-The city of doom

The sand glows grey and cold
Outside the city, where I stand and behold
The bleached bones rises high
Necropolis-Made of those who have died

In a shroud I am dressed
As if I am laid to my final rest
Twisted souls welcome me
Necropolis- My sanctuary

Necropolis- Mourns and wails
Necropolis- Agony prevails
