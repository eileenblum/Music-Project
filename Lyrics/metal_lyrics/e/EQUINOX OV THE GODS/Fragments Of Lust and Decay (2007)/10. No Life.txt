Through dreams I wander
Your smile engulfed my mind
I fear the dawn is drawing nigh
I fear the end of every night

Just keep me dreaming
Another life waits to be
Explored in the light
Radiating from the divine
Passion that is present
As the fire burning bright
In your eyes
In the moonlight
I see the ghost that I've come to be

Just keep me dreaming
Let my life be defined
By the temptations that you bring me
On my lonesome path through the night
Summoned by the vanity
Of a hope that was not meant to be
Embraced by someone
Someone like me
I see

No life!

I fade away for a dream
that seem to be forever beyond reach
Unnoticed by the angel
I die each night unseen
for a dream

I'm reaching for the sun, unseen,
In hope that the angel that dwell therein
Will notice me and take me into her dream

I realize it was all in vain
My wings are burning and I fall again
Into a maelstrom of agony and screams

No life! - Through dreams I wander
No life! - Your smile engulfed my mind
No life! - I fear the dawn is drawing nigh
No life! - I've closed the last door
No life! - Unseen I walk through life
No life! - I fear the end of every night
No life! - I fear the end is drawing nigh
No life! - I fear the end is drawing nigh
