"Dreams
dissolve 'fore our eyes
the prophet burn
a paradise
appear in screams
and raging fire
licks the flesh
of our sacrifice
tonight..."

If I could dream 
I would dream you through
An endless vision
We failed to see
Now burn the prophets 
For what they saw 
No hope, no future 
We failed to see 

Through life 

If I could dream 
We failed to see 
Our eyes were opened 
The Blind one's dream?
No time for reason
Down they fell
Before our eyes
Our blinded eyes

Through Hell 

"Eyes shadow blessed
by night light reaper
Of hollowed souls dressed
for their funeral
Stare through the abyss
Where the maggots are crumbling
At the core of the mass
never born"

See the ghosts I left behind,
Upon the reeking pile
Of twisted human flesh
I stare and watch it grow,
Underneath the moon so cold
The ravens die as foretold
By the prophets in the flames
the Blind one smiles he knows our name

And we failed to see
If I could dream 
And we failed to see
If I could dream 
No time for reason
Down they fell 
Before our eyes
If I could dream
