Carry my soul on the
Black wings of your ecstasy
Lift it up high
Towards the heavens in blasphemy
I am what i am
What i forever will be
In the name of Jesus fucking Christ
Bleed for me!

Stigmata

Carry my soul on the
Black wings of your ecstasy
The death of an angel
The sacrifice of purity
Impaled by faith
Desecrated is your sanctuary
In Hoc Signo
Bleed for me!

Stigmata

Behold the sign in my hand
I hold the key to the wonderland
The path is clear I'll lead the way
Follow me and don't walk astray
And if you really loves me true
Can i ask one thing from you
Show your love for all to see
Will you bleed for me
