Fear me...
Forever
In Shadows
In the darkness
And the cold
Pale and unwanted
Branded and scorned

The eyes
The eyes that see only illusions
The eyes
The lies
See through my naked body
Deny me if you can
The slow death of your infant soul
I enjoy
I destroy
The Eyes

The world is now my hiding place
My shadows
Everywhere
The cold
I feel so cold...
Wrapped in the stained sheets
Of your cheap motel sanctuary
A plague to the eyes that see only illusions
An angel's wings
Blackened with the sweetest of sins
Fear me
For I'm real
