See me walk...
I'm a blasphemy
Made not by god
But the power of his name i live

Look into my eyes
Empty and hollow...
What you see
Is my unholy soul

I am a result of necromantical arts
A body of clay, a stone is my heart
I am the Golem

See my limbs
Behold the scorn
Of creation
I don't want to be

With heavy steps
I stride the earth
Towards my end
I walk...
