Sprinkle eyes with grains of sand
Follow me into my land
Sleep now, child, close your eyes
Take my hand and away we fly

Here ends reality as you know it
The night is here with a gift for you
You've heard them whisper in the closet
You've seen them lurk under your bed

Here ends reality as you know that
You're on your own on the dreampath now
Grains of sand in your eyes and
You float away, so far away

Now i lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If i should die before i wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

You fade from reality
No string attached
In my arms
No turning back
You float away
So far away
