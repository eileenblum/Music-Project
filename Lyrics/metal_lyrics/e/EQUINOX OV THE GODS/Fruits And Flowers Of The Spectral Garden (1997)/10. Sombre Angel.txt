Silent wailing
Over the morgue
Silent whispering
Please tell me more

Access denied
Death is still a dream
I'm forced to remain
In this hollow reality

Silent laughters
From the graves
Silent temptations
The dead are free

Moving slowly,
Towards the tombs
Give me the password
To enter this womb

Sombre Angel-The key is in your hand
Silent Angel-My entrance i demand
Sombre Angel-Guardian of the final gate
Sombre Angel-Let me fulfil my fate

Sombre Angel
With your black wings hold me
Let darkness surround me
Let me sleep
Let me dream

Silent tears
In this sombre dreamland
Silent awareness
Will you now take my hand?
