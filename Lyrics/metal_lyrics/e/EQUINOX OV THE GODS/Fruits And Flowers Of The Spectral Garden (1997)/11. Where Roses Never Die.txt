Where roses never die
Another life, another try
Beyond the mountains, beyond the fields
My fortune is waiting for me
Another life... Another life...
Another life, another try
Where roses never die
Another life, another try

Beyond the forest of forever more...
Beyond the seas without shores...
Beyond the horizon of eternity
My fortune is waiting for me
So bright... So bright
I enter the tunnel of light
Where roses never die
Another life... I'm gonna try...

Sunshine fades and shadows fall
But sweet remembrance outlasts all...
