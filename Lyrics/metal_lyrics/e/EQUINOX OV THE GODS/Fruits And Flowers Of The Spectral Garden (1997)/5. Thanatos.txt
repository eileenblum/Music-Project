I am ready
I am waiting for you
Come whenever it pleases you
By my bed, a lock of my hair
I have said farewell
I won't despair

I've heard your steps
Outside the door
What keeps you waiting?
I was so sure
Now it is time for me to go beyond
Come now, with your torch
Turn it upside down

Dark and gloomy
He comes to us
Unexpected
Thanatos
He takes us to
The underworld
We're his sheep
He is the herd

Peace and silence
He brings to us
At the end of the life
Thanatos

He turns his torch
Upside down
And spreads his wings...
Thanatos
