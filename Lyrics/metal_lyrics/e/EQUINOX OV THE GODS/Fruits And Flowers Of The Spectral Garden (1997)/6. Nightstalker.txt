The autumn leaves are gently dancing
Upon the soil in which i lie
My place of rest for the living hidden
Far away from their prying eyes
Summoned by the monn ascending
Toward the surfice i slowly rise
To once again stroll the path of darkness
Crimson coloured it before me lies

I won't brake the masquerade
As i stalk my pray at night
Death comes swift and silent my dear
You won't feel the bite
And when the morning finally comes
Draind from blood you will be found
A withered flower in an alleyway
Under a shroud of frost, blaek and pale

In my tomb, my haven dark
I wait in dreamless sleep
The day to pass, the dusk to come
The time to leave my keep
