Spawned by frost wastelands
Out of ice and snow and shadows born
The legions that now stand ready
The fight and die for the Ogre Lord

The hordes of darkness are gathered
Their songs of war are heard afar
The drums of doom are pounding
Sacrifice to please the gods of war and wrath

Spill the entrails
Read the signs
The gods are pleased
With the sacrifice

Fires in the horizon
Black smoke fills the moonlit sky
Pounding, pounding thunder hooves
Like beasts out of hell these demons ride
Tonight

Under the fullmoon they gladly die
For the Ogre Lord
