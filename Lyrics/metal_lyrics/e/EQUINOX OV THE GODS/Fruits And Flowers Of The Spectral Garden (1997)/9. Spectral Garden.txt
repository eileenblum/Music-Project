Rotten trees with twisted boughs
Cast their shadows upon the ground
Where dead birds feathers and autumn leaves
Lie scattered by the midnight breeze

In this garden of endless night
Unseen by living, untouched by light
In this garden by time forgotten
Shadows prosper by death begotten

In the fog with a reek of a thousand graves
Faceless figures move grotesque and deranged
A dance macabre through this cursed domain
To a gruesome chant of sighs and wails

In this limbo beyond all dreams
Next to hell lies this sepulchral scene
Where spectres grieve their death eternal
A gloomy purgatory, dark, internal
