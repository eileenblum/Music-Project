Thursday night
The moon shines bright
The witching hour strikes
You stand at the crossroads
You summon me
Up from hell
With rhymes and spells
I will buy what you sell

You can feel i am near
I'll come. I'll Appear
You do not fear
The lord of the crossroads
Whit your blood you will sign
Your soul will be mine
I am the man in black
The lord of the crossroads

I will burn your soul
In the fires of hell...
