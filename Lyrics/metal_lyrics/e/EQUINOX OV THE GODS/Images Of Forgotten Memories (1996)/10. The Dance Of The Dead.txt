On this night we dance in the moonlight
Our feet are bare in the cold white snow
Our stiff bones move so slowely
Nut we will dance until our shrouds fall off

On this night we dance in the moonlight
Sad shapes among empty tombs
Beating the rhythm on wooden coffins
We will dance until our shrouds fall off

It is the Dance
Of the dead

On this night we dance in the moonligt
The dance of the dead until our shrouds fall off
Our rotten corpses move to the music
Tonight we are dancing among our candles and graves
