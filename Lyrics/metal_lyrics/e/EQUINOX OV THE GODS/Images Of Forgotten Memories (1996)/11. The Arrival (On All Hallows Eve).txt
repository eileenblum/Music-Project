I saw them dancing in the streets
An innocent play with aclors unknowing
Celebrating this ancient pagan feast
Unleashing my spirit. The shadows are growing

Im weaving their songs to spells once forgotten
And the pictures in their minds to seals that was broken
Sing my hymns and read my invocations
I'm the unexpected guest. I accept your invitation

And alone in her bed
The virgin lies dreaming
The visions in her mind
Wakes her up screaming

The seed is sown
The shadows are growing
The dance goes on
With actors unknowing
The night is young, it has merely begun
My waiting is over, my time has come

And alone in her room
The virgin is weeping
In a dream she saw
From beyond, the darkness came creeping...
