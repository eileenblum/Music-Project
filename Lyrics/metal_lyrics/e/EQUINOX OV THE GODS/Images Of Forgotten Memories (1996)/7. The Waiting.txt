I look at the horizon
As the everlasting sky
Just like it is on fire
And the sun is about to die
Forever you are calling me
Forever i hear your voice
Forever you are calling me
Giving me no choice...

I watch the stars sparkle
And the moon shine...
I pray to the four seasons
That our love will never die
Forever you are calling me
From a place where the sun shines
Forever you will be missing me
If you don't help me find...

From Summerland you are calling me
To a place i cannot find
I beg you, come and take my hand
Lead me beyond space and time
Forever you are calling me
From our kingdom come
Forever you will wait for me
Wait for my time to come...
