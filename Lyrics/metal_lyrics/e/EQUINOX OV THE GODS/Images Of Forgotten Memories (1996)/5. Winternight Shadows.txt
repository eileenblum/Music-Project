Silent we're approaching
In silence we stride
Dakr as our souls
Is the fire in our eyes
We dance in the moonlight
In forests so black
We've been gone for a while
Now we're back

You can feel our presence
The coldness we bring
You can hear our voices
In the darkness we sing
Songs about solitude
Anguish and tears
Songs about winterland
And freezing fears

Closer and closer
You can feel that we are near
Our darkness surrounds you
Now we are here
Winternight shadows
To haunt you again
We want you to join us
In our icy, dark domain
