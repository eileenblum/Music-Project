I am collecting the pieces
I look at the remains
I am burying the ashes
Nothing is the same
What is now left of me
Is slowly fading away
The endless path of sorrow
I am back on it again

Life is turning pages
I close the remaining doors
The halls of life lie empty
I don't expect no more
Another castle has fallen
It is dreams scattered in the wind
My mind is pure and innocent
Yes it is coloured by shadows from within

Eternity will dry my tears
And banish all my fears
I close my eyes and sleep
Forever in eternal peace...

It is a cold summer night
The moon is waning, it is shining bright
I have lost my will to live
Life has nothing for me to give
Death may give peace
Or nothing at all
Either i stand either i fall
It doesn't matter as long as this ends
I am not gonna miss it
Life is not my friend!
