Now lost in darkness
A child of the night
Stalking the streets
In the pale moonlight
Your skin is warm and soft
While mine is white and cold
Come, let me kiss you
Mysteries Unfold

I am beyond life
I am beyond death
I will take your life
I will take your breath
Come here, my darling
I want you to hold
Come, let me kiss you
Mysteries Unfold

We are dancing in fire
Embraced by the flames
We are kissing each other
We are kissed by the flames

And as i dive into oblivion
My mind is scattered in the wind
I drown in the sea of the lost louls
Lord Jesus won't come
