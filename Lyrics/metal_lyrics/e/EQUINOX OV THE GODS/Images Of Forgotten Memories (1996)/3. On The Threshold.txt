Sorrow and grief
Alone i walk
Across fields
Of crimson flowers
Frozen in time
This eternity is mine
From my wounds
I won't recover

Night-time tears
In silence i see the world pass by
I watch new fears
From the pits of my soul they arise

Broken and torn
My soul is forlorn
On this endless plain
Of tombs and ashes
Every tear i have cried
is marked with a stone
My emotions are buried
Deep in the soil

I bury my ashes
My earthly remains
Silent i weep
Dark gods whisper my name
Hell awaits
Alone i stand outside its gate
Let me now in
Let me enter my dark kingdom come

And now the darkness
Surrounds my lonely soul
As i lived i now die
All alone
I reap the fruits
From the seed i once sowed
The grapes of oblivion
Delight my soul

I vanish in the darkness
On this gloomy plain i fade away
I leave a life in sadness
In this realm of shadows i'd rather stay
