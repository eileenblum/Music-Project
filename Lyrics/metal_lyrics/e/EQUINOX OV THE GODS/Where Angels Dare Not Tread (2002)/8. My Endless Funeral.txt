Time
Like ice now frozen
A moment
An eternity
Eyes
Underneath the surface
Watching
Staring at you

Cry
Oblivion engulfs me
Lay me down
Pleasure for you
Pray
As a true believer
My soul is lost
Nothing's left for you

Time
Like ice now frozen
A moment
An eternity
Dust
At my endless funeral
Your dreams
In vain comes true

Tears will drown you
In pretended grief you gorge
At my endless funeral
The bells toll for you
