Upon the moor
A ragged shape
So silent stand
In your dreams
With outstretched wings
The Angel dance
So dark and fearful
Can you see his face?
And then another vision
Will this never end?

Dark and deep
The endless sea
Where the dreamer dwells
Belial felt
The dragons breathe
Then the Angels fell
To play among the shadows
Can you hear them call?
Penetrate the silence
Will you heed their call?

Another night
The Broken one
Is back again
The Scarecrow
Can't be banished
Who will hear you pray?
Upon the moor in silence
Heed the dreamers call
It penetrate the silence
Will you heed their call?
