Upon shallow graves
The sisters (are) dancing
Upon the bones of seven dead
Through raven's eyes
The ghosts are watching
Through a realm of pain
They slowly move

Seven daggers buried deep
The seven sisters never sleep

On this night of the scarecrow
The blood-moon shines
Seven corpses never found
The masque of the dead
They wear tonight
The seven sisters with raven's eyes

For the angel - the Scarecrow - The broken one
Whose wings are but shadows in the setting sun
The unhallowed sisters dance tonight
Kissed by the devil in the pale moon light

Seven phantoms - seven graves
Seven sisters without names
Blessed by the Scarecrow
Blessed by the night
Torn and broken shadows dance
The angel is watching
In shrouds of mist and spiders web
The seven sisters with raven's eyes
