Black blood. Dust and ashes.
In the spiders web the fly is lost
Dead eyes in darkness prying
Within my corpse the worms still crawl

Bleached bones 'round my throne lie scattered
Where life once bloomed now silence rule
Faceless A dark god now risen
To purge the earth, to thin the heard
Brought to life in silence
Out of worm infested graves
In darkness I've risen
To curse the world again

The Earth is dead...

The black wounds never healing
Welcome death, I've come to you
The hellish pain increasing
My legacy I've brought to you

Brought to life in silence
Out of worm infested graves
In darkness I've risen
To curse the world again

Plaguebringer
The Earth is dead...
