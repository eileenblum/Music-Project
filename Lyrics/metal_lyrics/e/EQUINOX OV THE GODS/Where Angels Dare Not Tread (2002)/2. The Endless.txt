Torn apart
The moonlit night
The silence
And then no more
Left to die
In another dream
I would shine
It would be mine...

The silent one before me rise
I watch him glow...
So cold and naked...
His eyes are burned away

I stare into the darkness
Where nothing can be seen
Tears fall from my weary eyes
Nothing can be seen

Fading dreams and visions
Purity has its price
The silent one, the Endless...
Staring with empty eyes
Across the room upon the wall
Motionless I hang
Denied my life
In another dream
I would shine
It would be mine...

Torn apart
The moonlit night
The silence
And then no more
Left to die
In another dream
I would shine
It would be mine...

The silent one before me rise
I watch him glow...
So cold and naked...
His eyes are burned away

And one by one
The statues came to life
As if driven by an unseen force
Slowly they moved
With heavy steps through the portal
Toward the great unknown
And then...
No more...
