Rise
Toward the surface
Through the eye of the storm
You'll find the way
The way through the labyrinth
Sweet Leviathan
Across oceans of time
You'll find the way

Stride
The path of angels
Watch the shadows dance
Along your way
Behind your back
Decomposition
For each step you take
For each question why

Burned right before your empty eyes
Scattered around the charred bones lie
Wings are broken and feathers torned
No tears will fall for those forlorn
Pale ghosts are rising
From their shallow graves
To devour the last of hopes
To make it fade away

Psyche
The ever changing tide
The banner fell in the ashes
Upon the field where the victims lie
Transformation
The way of the butterfly
As seasons change with reason
The truth become a lie
