Voices, sweet and beckoning
In your mind, leads you the way
Guides you through the blackened night
They've promised that you'll be safe

Shadows dance before your eyes
To a tune the devil plays
You're mesmerized by his tender songs
From the depths of the cursed lake

The fog lie thick, on the surface dark
At the shore you stand alone
With empty eyes, at the lake you stare
Soon the devil will take his bride

Take his hand, join the dance
Leave this world so far behind
A night of joy, then oblivion
Within the depths of the cursed lake
