Behind the walls I hide where the sun cannot reach me
Within the tower where you can't see my face
Through dust I slowly stride where the night is forever
Within the tower where you can't see my face

One step behind you
Turn around, and I am gone
You'll never see me
Just a feeling that something is so wrong
Each night I wander
Uninvited, from the tower
A nightly guest
Who has come to kiss your life good-bye

From the past, a shadow
A phantom, in the pale moonlight
I can see you
Oh, how sweet is not your face in fright
Your heart is pounding
As you walk through the shadow of the tower
I can smell your fear
And I know that you know that l am near
