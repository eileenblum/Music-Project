A white lie my bride on her silken sheet
red as the blossom of crimson deeds
her dress is stained by the sins she craved
I am damned I fear I can not be saved
with a smile she kissed my life goodbye
and so begins this gothic lullaby

carnal, her intentions she whispered to me
a shameless invitation to the cemetery
to play in the moonlight where the dead are laid to rest
to rejoice in the flesh among the ghostlike silhouettes
of the statues and tombstones surrounding the scene
where love tumed into the most horrible dream
the truth of her nature so cunningly concealed
was in the heat of the moment suddenly revealed

aroused by the passion that flavoured her kiss
bewitched by the heat she rode me to bliss
she bid me to enter the cavern of sin
the temple flesh erected therein
I drank from the nectar that streamed from her well
while she opened my veins and the gateway to hell
lost where all hope of salvation and grace
the path of the damned was for me to embrace

white lie my bride in our foul retreat
so cold and pale in her winding sheets
far from the sun in a desecrated grave
I am damned I fear I can not be saved

wicked wicked vile saturnine
stygian shadow among shadows malign
wicked wicked vile saturnine
stygian shadow among shadows malign

plague bringer harbinger of gloom and demise
a pestilence disguised an apparition of life
plague bringer harbinger of gloom and demise
a pestilence disguised an apparition of life
