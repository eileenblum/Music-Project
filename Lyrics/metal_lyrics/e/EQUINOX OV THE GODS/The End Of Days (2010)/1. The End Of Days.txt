sky clad dance
the magick black
as the ravens  eyes tonight
the unseen draped in darkness
spawn of the twilight
will join us in our circle and chant with us the runes
to weave the spells of holy war
beneath the pale full moon

blessed with wormwood visions
unfold now  fore our eyes
the secrets of the darkest arts
of death the grand devise
our book of shadows inked in blood
our goetia will reveal
a path forbidden and by time
buried and concealed

nightshade belladonna
adorn forgotten graves
with your demonic beauty
bring us now
the end of days

awake now from your slumber
from your dreamless sleep tonight
by the gates of death you've waited
we summon you now rise
three times six the crucifix
now broken and defiled
the wonds inverted as Lords  prayer
is recited heretic style
thirteen candles lit the bell chimes
now the time has come
thunder roars a cold wind blows
the war has just begun

devilry witches vile at work
sharpening the torture spells
we scorch the heavens with the screams
of dying angels bound for hell
a black magick crazed apocalypse
with a hellish roar ablaze
the deathly words of the inferno mass
bring us now
the end of days

nightshade belladonna
adorn forgotten graves
with your demonic beauty
bring us now
the end of days
