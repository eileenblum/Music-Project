tranquility kiss the paralyzed bliss
come flowing red as the blood that is shed
on the way of the serpent of the abysmal sea
by venom and dagger and foul witchery

souls dissolve as mysteries unfold
in the dead of the night haunted and cold
piercing fangs eat their way through the flesh
of the mass born to bondage and death

sucking the fat off the flogged sacrifice
defiling the temple of life
the way of the serpent a scourge of mankind
the carnivorous plague of the night

ceremonial slaughter in clandestine kill
for Leviathan great let fate now embrace
our black hearts with the power and the glory of the way
of hell in shadows we eagerly wait

from sewers and dungeons and pits dripping wet
spawn of the gorgons rise from the depths
bring hell unto earth let your gaze petrify
the vermin that soil the sight of our eyes

we re culling the herd a crimson disease
spreads like wildfire we re burning the fields
to summon the massacre storm that will shred
the flesh off the living and spare nothing from death

swift as the viper lethal we strike
the way of the serpent of terror and fright
blasphemous offspring of Satan now rise
from the lair of the adder Armageddon in sight

come friends of disaster hell-bound and free
the storm let it roar its choral of war
over cities in ruin and corpses ablaze
the Garden of Eden and heaven in flames
