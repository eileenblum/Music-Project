whisper my names to the murder of crows
to the twilight and to the cold wind that blows
through your marrow and bones through your heart and your soul
whisper my names to the worms and the mould

walk in my shadows and know that I'm near
when you least expect it I m the moment you fear
I m the father of nightmares I am time passing by
walk in my shadows until it s your turn to die

swing back and forth to the choir of flies
swing back and forth in the sun's fading light
swing back and forth I will hold you so tight
swing back and forth while we dance through the night

swing back and forth to the choir of flies
swing back and forth in the sun's fading light
swing back and forth at the end of the rope
swing back and forth so far beyond hope
