Into the darkest of nights, you shall drown
As your eye meets the eye of the storm
The gathering of the lost souls
In the woods of unknown...

Colossal rains bring down the plague
Black raindrops fall down as a tear from the widow's eye
The eternal night 'pon the doomed landscape
Moon dyes the horizon red as blood...

The coldest of the winternights, frozen winter time
The snow falls onto the black soil
Covering everything under the sheet of silence
This is my blackest dream come true

The era of the darkmind is coming onto the world
The weakest of the mankind, "it was told in the word",
Shall be put to death in the name of the lord
I raise my fist to the sky "My god!" hear me out...
