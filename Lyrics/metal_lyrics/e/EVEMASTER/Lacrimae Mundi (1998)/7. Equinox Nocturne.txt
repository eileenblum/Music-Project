The ages that stir the dark waters of time
Are surrounded by the enchanting woods of pine
Oh thee O' Northstar let your pale light lead my path
Through these ancient times these ancient lands...
September's fire lick the woods
Making the nature burn in majestic flames
Oh' I embrace your infinite beauty
The breathing forest that surrounds this path

Standing on a hill looking down these lands O' so might
Under the open skies, where emotions arise...
The land O' so might!
The land of thousand lakes!
The land of bravehearted men!

Deep eye of earth full of tears
I look into you and see the reflection
Of a mortal crowned with leaves and surrounding trees
Old spirits of the earth having the feast of autumn
There shall no mortal repose but stand enthralled by the beauty of immortal joy...

The yearning for immortal life thrives me forth to my Eden
Your eyes still full of tears enchanting me
giving me the reason to go on, to go on to greet the paradise lost
Snow falls from darkened skies as I wander deeper in the woods...
