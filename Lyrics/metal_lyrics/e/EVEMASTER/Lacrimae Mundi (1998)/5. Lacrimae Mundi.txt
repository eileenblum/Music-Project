"Caught in thy net of shadows, what dreams hast thou to show?
Who treads the silent meadows, to worship thee below?"
Thee who wanders amongst the mortal, never see the light of day
Thee who watch the storm approaching, the darkness calls thy name

"Let the serpent tempt you to a sin, When the lowering sun dyes the crimson seas
And let the ravens lead you there, where no angels dare to tread or dream (sleep)..."

Thee who wanders amongst the mortal, never see the light of day
Thee who watch the storm approaching, the darkness calls thy name
Doth thou know of Majesty, of thine soul's nocternity
And velvet seas, that caress the distant shores?

Will they ever search for the truth
known by the great wise ones?
Will they ever find the truth
will they ever bleed the whores?

LACRIMAE MUNDI

"Whoever sheds the blood of a man by a man shall his blood be shed,
and vengeanced with the utter hatred..."

Nightmares haunt thy sleep at nights...
The laughter of chaos and scythe...
Why thee did against me?
None forbid, but thrusts to misery...

This means WAR!

...and the world shall cry forever...
