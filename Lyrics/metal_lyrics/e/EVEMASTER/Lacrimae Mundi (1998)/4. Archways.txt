I can hear the flicker of flames
and the seasons' change as I fall through the forest floor
I feel myself falling deeper - Will I ever greet her?
The entrance and the chamber door...

"Ah, I still remember - it was in the bleak December
Each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the forest floor"
They stretch their dead calm fingers - stood silent through long winters
Ghastly and silent, casting their shadows now and forevermore

Forevermore...

Deep into the woods gazing - I stood there wondering
dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken - no voices were awoken
embraced in darkness I fell on my knees on the forest floor

Forevermore...

I heard my heart beating - and the woods started breathing
I could hear my whispers even louder I heard them before
The whispers pierced my mind, the pictures in my eyes
I whispered the tales told never before of the heroes of yore

My heart is sorrow laden - this life is slowly fading
I want to see more, feel more, please I implore!
I still have so much to see - in these woods surrounding me
take me back to Draconian shore

Found the ancient fanes anything so arcane, the time draws nigh, forevermore
See the shadows dance in the night's clasp on a star lit sky, nevermore

The eastern horizon's black turns blood - As I cry I can feel the closing dawn
These nocturnal archways come - something undone
But the memory of me shall remain forevermore...

Forevermore...

As I rise on my wings to fly - The zephyr brings tear to my eye
This darkness I adore - further I'll explore
But the memory of me shall remain forevermore...
