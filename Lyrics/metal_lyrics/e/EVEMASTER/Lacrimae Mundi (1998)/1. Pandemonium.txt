He, over the stars doth reign that unto wisdom can attain
The soul of a man is nobler than the spheres
The hunger thou has awakened culminates in fulfilment
Reached the highest level of a mortal man that has ever been reached

Let thy might carry over the seas, over the vast centuries
"Do what thou wilt" will be the final law
When thee feel the overflowing anger, satisfy thy hunger
And take what you think belongs to thee

Not the divine grace but your infernal might inside -
Pandemonium

When the dusk comes you get the urge to go on a hunt
Meet the children of your kind and you will hunt as one
Be their master and lead them to salvation
To the garden of stone to sleep forever

He, over the stars doth reign that unto wisdom can attain
The soul of a man is nobler than the spheres
The hunger thou has awakened culminates in fulfilment
Reached the highest level of a mortal man that has ever been reached

Not the divine grace but your infernal might inside -
PANDEMONIUM!!!
