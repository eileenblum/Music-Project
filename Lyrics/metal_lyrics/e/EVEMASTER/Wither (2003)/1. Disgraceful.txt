Alone I'm sitting in my room watching the time to pass me by
Solitude my only friend rejected from life I thought was mine
I thought was mine...

Black burnt shell - Frozen inside
Disgraceful - All cold inside

I've seen myself so dark, yet so fine, carrying that flower once called life
Seeing myself so dark and so serene
My world seems to crumble before my eyes
Crumble into eternity...

Black burnt shell - Frozen inside
Disgraceful - All cold inside

Gone to darkness is this human soul solitude its' only friend
Sorrowladen and too weak to let it go
Crash and burn this is a dead-end

I want to break free from this human-made paradise
The snake in the garden of Eden cries out my name calling me there...
I want to give my life to someone who can live it right
The call is too strong for me to resist 'till the end of me

Alone I'm sitting in my room, curtains blocking the sun from my eyes
Seeing myself so dark and so serene
My world seems to crumble before my eyes
(Crumble into eternity...)

Black burnt shell - Frozen inside
Disgraceful - All cold inside

Black burnt shell - Frozen inside
Disgraceful - All dead inside
