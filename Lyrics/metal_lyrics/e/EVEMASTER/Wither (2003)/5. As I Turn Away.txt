As I turn away from this life that I look from far away
As the leaves turn to grey I greet my fathers for the last time
I've seen so many times when someone fades away and dies alone
This is my time I knew it by the look in your saddened eyes

I feel that I have gone too far;
Oh my love, tell me where have all the flowers gone!
(I will greet the eternity for you...)

As I turn away...
