Ride on the crest of the wind above... dive into the moonlit sea (below)...
Let thy spirit fly with a flame rising up to the (highest) skies...
Outcast children enchanted by the beauty of the stars...
Serenity clings to their weak mortal souls, those emerald eyes you don't know...

Stars displaced... Serenity embraced... the burning I feel... it burns in me...

The fresh dew of newborn day, as the morning star fades away
Serenity flees as the moon drowns to sea, set them free and let them come to me...

Stars displaced... Serenity embraced... the burning I feel... it burns in me...

When the Sun and the Moon unite, the Sun will go blind by the shadow of the Moon
And the Sun it burns so bright,
these will be the last times it will shine it's light on us
I have travelled through strange dimensions,
and now it's my time to join the pulse of the universe
These are the times of stranger aeons,
and the skies will tear with roar and the water will rain as blood
And the world will burn.
