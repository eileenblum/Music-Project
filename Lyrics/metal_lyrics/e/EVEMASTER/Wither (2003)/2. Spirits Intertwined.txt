Hail to thee, thou new moon - jewel of the night
Ye kings of sun and moon - ye kings of the stars above
Hail to thee, thou new moon - mother of the stars
Ye servants of the skies above - the midnight garden of the stars

There I shall be again by the beating drums...

Hail to thee, thou new moon - daughter of the sun
The equinox of the night is here 'pon everyone
The garden midnight sun - the hall of the evening star
Going deeper, burning up, feel the spirit escape the flesh...
To the other world

There I shall be again by the beating drums...
Where the spirits ride the winds
Thus spoke the spirits intertwined, embraced in mist
We welcome thee to our world - now enter the sacred path...
And walk on...

A midnight in the garden of evil...
A midnight in the garden of evil...
A midnight in the garden of evil...
A midnight in the garden of evil

When is this spirit to be reborn?
To reach the beauty of forevermore
Baptized in fire, self-slain by thought
Immortality is what I have so long sought for...

When is this spirit to be reborn?

A midnight in the garden of evil...
A midnight in the garden of evil...
A midnight in the garden of evil...
A midnight in the garden of evil!
