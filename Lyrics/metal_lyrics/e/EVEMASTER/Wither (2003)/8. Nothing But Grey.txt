Shrouded in mist I stand here above the world
The sky is turning red as I watch the mortals die
The hour of reckoning is closing near, these poor mortal souls have (their) eternity to fear
After the clash, after the glow of war

There's nothing but grey, the clouds are hanging low
There's nothing but grey, bleeding their pain away

And no one to shed no tears, for humanity
Sky is burning, trying to burn away
Crying down its pain, trying to cleanse the grief and blood stains
Of humanity

There's nothing but grey, the clouds are hanging low
There's nothing but grey, bleeding their pain away
There's nothing but grey, all life is lost
There's nothing but grey, faded into grey

The black rain falls like a drapery at the end of the act
But the winds are the only ones to howl

The hour of reckoning is closing near, these poor mortal souls have (their) eternity to fear
After the clash, after the glow of war... there's nothing but grey!

The black rain falls like a drapery at the end of the act
But the winds are the only ones to howl
After the clash, after the glow of war... there's nothing but grey anymore
the clouds are hanging low, bleeding their pain away
all life is lost, faded into grey

And it all turns to grey
