What once was shall never be again
Immortal I lust unto the eternal end
Fall my wrath upon everything - And crown me to rule your kings
With clenched fists and closed eyes - Onward to battle to silence the cries
What once was shall never be again
Immortal I lust unto the eternal end
Born of thunder amidst the pouring rain
I shall be once again

Harvest skies are burning red, crimson liquid of life be shed
I'll breed fear wherever I roam, 'til I'm ready to feast in the infernal dome

Where angels fear to tread
Ravens rule their kingdom
Ebony towers, scarlet jg
Before the greatest battle all mortal flee

Harvest skies are burning red, crimson liquid of life be shed
I'll breed fear wherever I roam, 'til I'm ready to feast in the infernal dome
The skies darken, the oceans part, murderous storms are rising
Revelations, I'll give thee the plague, I watch the world vanish in flames...

"I will come as a dark nightmare to haunt my weak enemies"

The winter of thousand years
vanish all weak mortality!
Fall my wrath upon everything - And crown me to rule your kings
With clenched fists and closed eyes - Onward to battle to silence the cries

Harvest skies are burning red, Crimson liquid of life be shed
I'll breed fear wherever I roam, 'til I'm ready to feast in the infernal dome
The skies darken, the oceans part, Murderous storms are rising
Revelations, I'll give thee the plague, I watch the world vanish in flames... Tonight!
