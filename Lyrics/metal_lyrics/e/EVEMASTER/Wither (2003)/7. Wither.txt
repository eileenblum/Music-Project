I fell on my knees, without mercy
I could feel the noose strangle me
My eyes couldn't see, I couldn't speak
When the season of withering came on to me

Close to the ledge of life, I will bleed for your sins
I wish my life unborn, so in sorrow I didn't drown
Take my hand, (and walk with me let me lead you), let me lead you into oblivion

Be smothered in pain, and all in vain
Do you really think you are sane?
Be the one to yearn, you won't learn
As the season of withering comes on to you

Close to the ledge of life, I will bleed for your sins
I wish my life unborn, so in sorrow I didn't drown
Take my hand, (and walk with me let me lead you), let me lead you into oblivion

Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again

Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again

Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again

Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
