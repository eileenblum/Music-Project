Darkness descends and the prowlers come out
They roam through the night
Looking for weak souls to join them
Looking for strength to gain

There're always rotten limbs to be cut off
But no possibility to do so
So there are voices to be heard
When agitators gather their herbs

Like humanimals, labouring
Gathering their herds
The powerless and the voiceless of the mass
The ones that have nothing

Once again they revert to their holes
Once again the dawn is their foe
Once again humanimals will gather in the night
Once again their numbers numbers multiplied
Once again they roam from their holes
And they will gather more lost souls
Their army is growing silently, the word echoes on the streets

Humanimals
Labouring
Gathering their herds
Spreading through society

Darkness descends and the prowlers come out
They roam through the night
Looking for weak souls to join them
Looking for strength to gain
