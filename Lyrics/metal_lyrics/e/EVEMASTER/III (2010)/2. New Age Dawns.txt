First rays of the new rising sun burn my eyes
Sweating and trembling, lying on my bed
What are these dreams of decadence?
Flashes from the past or future visions?
I cannot really understand
Feels like I'm awake even I know I'm sleep

The dawning of the new age

Perfect lives... perfect days... in this new world of grace
All is free... perfect peace... empire of the sun

Once again fully awake and back in reality
A full day of rewarding work ahead
Every soul has got their duty to do
And they are happy to carry their weight
No dissonance, no scratches on the shiny surface
All is too good, too perfect, untrue

And the new age dawns
Time to rise and shine
Wake up from the unreal dream
Come, enjoy the peace

First rays of the new rising sun
And what are these dreams of decadence?
Feels like I'm awake even though I know I'm asleep
