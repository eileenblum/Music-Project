They raise their fists against you
Themob is causing havoc
Let them know who's in charge here
Let them know they'll get what they deserve

Using the power... over people... controlling the system
Show them you're king, their emperor, their god... Make them understand!

The revolting mob is getting nearer
The skyline burns in flames
They're bringing down your authority
You have to react, you have to join their game

The great unrest has started, your ivory tower going up in flames
There's a way to tame the movement, you gotta distribute the cure

The Great Unrest - Revolution's on your pearly gates
The Great Unrest - You have to act now before it's all too late
The Great Unrest - Revolution's on your pearly gates
The Great Unrest - inject the cure... 'fore it's too late!

Lawforce is trying to protect your power
But there's no way to escape
You need to fix the problem
And use the cure to tame this instability

Prepare the fix
Get ready to distribute
Tame down the uprising
Don't let those subhumans win
