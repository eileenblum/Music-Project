Medicate the needs of society
Opium for the masses
To keep them tied, to keep their minds
Condemned - Contempt - Forced to obey

"The fix is in... and I can feel the peace closing in
Calming down the fall of my society"

Breakdown was near but we held back
The cure calmed down the roar
Revolution subsides humanimals fell back
The fix killed the uproar

The sweet poison, relieves the need
The need to feel free
The sweet poison, tames down the crowd
Pushes back the uproar

It's the sweet poison
Spread out in the society
Watch out, watch out, watch out...

Relieving the need to feel free
I'm the one to tie them down
Their king, emperor, their god...
