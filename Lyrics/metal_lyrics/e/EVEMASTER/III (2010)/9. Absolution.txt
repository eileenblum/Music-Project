Fragile, this world that was created for me
Corroding inside, leaving me numb and broken, broken
These dreams, I yearn for, are not what they seem to be

Will I see another day rise?
Will I fall in another dream, once again?
Fragile, this world that was created for me

No, not for you! By you!
You can't control your own creation but still you yearn for absolution...

Deposed, degraded, back in filth again
Drown in the everlasting shame
Dethroned, stripping of the dignity
My gods, why are you cursing me?

Let me wear the crown!

Accept my sacrifice, and absolve me...
Or was I doomed to find out my own mortality?
