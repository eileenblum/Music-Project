Now that the people are fed, and all the dogs are counted for
I can feel the closing dusk, sundown is here
I'm in the height of my strength, I can control it all
Once again back on my feet, and the vision is clear

Drug-fed humanimals
Are now to be damned
They need to be conformed
Blunt their will to resist

Looking down on my empire, all is silent and under control
This is to show who's their master, their king... their god

"Thee shall be damned, curse on ye disobedient ones!"

Drug-fed humanimals
Are now to be damned
They need to conformed
Blunt their will to resist

The harvester of souls
You shouldn't have risen against me
Refused the addiction, medicate

What are these, dreams of grandeur?
Why I keep seeing myself falling from grace?
