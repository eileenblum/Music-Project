Revolution's starting on the outskirts of the city
Spreading like a wildfire underground

Revolting mob, trying to overcome their fear
When the dusk falls they roam out from their holes
The revolution's getting near

Losing Ground

The hate against the power is getting overwhelming
They are trying to dethrone their despot, bring down their only king

Do you... realize... that they are... trying to break up your world?

You're starting to lose the ground
Should you start to be concerned?
Before all hell breaks loose
You gotta inject the cure
