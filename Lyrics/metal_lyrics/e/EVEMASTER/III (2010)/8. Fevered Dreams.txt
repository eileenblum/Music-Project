What are these fevered dreams of decadence that I see flash before my eyes
This filthy roomaround me, I'm lying on the bed sheets strangling me

Gladly I have the cure to keep me from falling into these dreams

Fragile I see myself again, the pillars of my dominion perishing
Got to get back in control again
Got to get back before my world crumbles down, crumbles down, burns down to the ground

Fevered dreams of grandeur
Flashing before my eyes

What I see... is this real?

Fragile I see myself again... the pillars are perishing...
Fragile dreams...
