Arioch! Knight of Swords, deceitful god.
Beyond the sealed sign of chaos. I held your heart, destroyed it.
So Arkyn, Law may right the scale when the balance falls.
The Earl will ride and I will follow. When he's under my blade, then I can die.

I've banished Gods, The Rulers of Swords and giants, I do not fear The Dog and The Bear.

Fhoi Myore, you ride in mist by chariot.
Bryionak, Retaliator! From an ancient forge the anvils sing!
The Dagdagh Harp, I fear it's song though I don't recall (why).
Moon-colored sword, I name you "Traitor", from a dream I remember, and to which I am tied.

Upon the field, the Mabden have rode and they are ready to die for the Silvern Hand.

With this spear I have brought green back to my land,
And I've seen kings restored by a golden Oak and Ram.
With this steel I have brought doom upon my foes,
Now it seeks my heart and returns me to my home.
