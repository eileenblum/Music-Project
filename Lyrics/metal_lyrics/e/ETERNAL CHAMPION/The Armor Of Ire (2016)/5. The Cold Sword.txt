A name is called and I'm thrown into a world draped in ice. The Frozen Keep is my dominion? The Champion's fate, to wake in worlds anew.

The Southern Ice, the white unbroken. The cardinal red sun is dying. To Rowenarc, the obsidian citadel.

"The hilt of the sword and the hand are as one."
The chalice screams, and demands of me what I loathe.
"The blade of the sword has the blood of the Sun."
Pawn of Fate, your glory and doom are one.

A maddened king will lead his men to ruin, the warriors of silver are caught. For their queen, they'll battle, but they've no hope from The Black Sword.

Always a price, always a burden. The balance right, the chalice now full. Many names, Fate's Soldier, I will find Tanelorn!

"The hilt of the sword and the hand are as one."
The chalice screams, and demands of me what I loathe.
"The blade of the sword has the blood of the Sun."
Pawn of Fate, your glory and doom are one.

From the fallen Moon they will ride. Under the blade the queen she will die.
From the Scarlet Fjord they will ride. Under the blade the queen she will die.
The fief of the sword is your life.
