It's by mercy alone, that I cannot recount. The memories fade and I weaken. A glimpse of old things, vile and cruel, haunting my dreams when I doze. The Spawn of Stars, Cthulhu and kin, invoked by a cult. In their folly they called the ones who would trample and crawl upon Earth, now their own.

Then I beheld Kadath and it's cloud-hidden peak.
And I beheld the Crawling Chaos beneath.
They kneel 'fore the invoker.
The Old Ones, awakened again.

The days are a fog, the misty unreal. I wait for the night and my ruin. Of vistas strange and lands passing below the shantak I ride when I doze. I hear Atal and Nyarlathotep, and the chanting of one I would slaughter. He speaks the name, from Leng he invokes the Old Gods, the Old Ones.

Then I beheld Kadath and it's cloud-hidden peak.
And I beheld the Crawling Chaos beneath.

Before he raises The Goat and Her Thousand. Before he calls the ones he cannot put back, I will attack. Before The Deep Ones come rising and crawling, Before he calls the ones he cannot put back, I will attack. They kneel 'fore the invoker.
The Old Ones, awakened again.

The moment has come, the horror unreal. They wait at the gate, but I see them. And in my mind I will always recall the sound of the Gods as they rose. I hear him call and a horrendous reply, the chanting will bring his own slaughter. The dagger shines in the hand of the fool, and I throw my own in his heart.

They kneel 'fore the invoker.
The Old Ones, awakened again.
Smite the invoker!
