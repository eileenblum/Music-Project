Into the vale beneath the autumn ridges flows the Cotras. It cuts it's way to Raven's Eyrie's door. Under the strange moon the night winds mock the Sun. The hound is baying for his master Demonlord.

Ever the rider, ever the foe. The name of Kane forever known. By spell or by steel the brazen fall. Bear the curse and bear the time. The Seven Nameless hear thy cry. The Grey Lord and not Thoem will have your soul.

Valdese by revenge your soul can be as one. No longer must you stalk among the nighted boles. Seven times seven, the Grey Lord will return, and carry back with him the soul which he has won.

Wherever Kane has walked, a trail of crimson would follow now. Cursed by Theom! He will tread through the ages until the treasures of kings turn to dust, and the flesh of all men falls from their time-eaten bones. Lord Tloluvin, Sathonys, wait an age for the one that will not die!

In a tower of stone there burns a fire. The pain of steel for any who'd cross. The fatal eyes, weaken the brave. Horror met by the rushing of his blade. Lord Tloluvin, Sathonys, wait an age for the one that would not die. The hunting hound, the Demonlord, mark him by the strange hilt of his sword.

Ever the rider, ever the foe, the name of Kane forever known. By spell, or by steel, the brazen fall.

Valdese by revenge your soul can be at one. No longer must you stalk among the nighted boles. Seven times seven, the Grey Lord will return...
