From the west I hear the riders of Tarsul have gone
Into the North, they join Haiklan in war
Let both rise up to meet my armies, they are battle-starved
And I promised them a feast of two nations' blood

For I am not
Not to Be Crossed
I command the guards of Lourn
I am the Hammer

In the south Kynara forms her ranks 8000 strong
To fight the demon priest of Ill Nitaar
I warned them once I am the hammer, they are glowing iron
No sorcery can force the Pyre Forge

For I am not
Not to Be Crossed
I command the guards of Lourn
I am the Hammer

Over the peaks, frost bitten riders of Tarsul have come
Haiklan has joined them at their own demise
Farick, I ask, my steel is tempered true and armor strong
I've forged our brands in the rites of Pyre Forge

For I am not
Not to Be Crossed
I command the guards of Lourn
I am the Hammer
