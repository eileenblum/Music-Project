Ripping into my own flesh
I'm glad to die
Choking on a tide of blood
I take my own life

Tears stain guilt I feel
A twisted life I led
Falling into the ground
I leave myself for dead

Burning withering on me
I believe what I believe
Away from me light slowly fades
Wake me before I sleep
Tears shine and fall where I will lie

Wake me
Before I die

Screaming as you left me to die
Endless a lifeless body again
Nothing more remains
Save me from being the same
