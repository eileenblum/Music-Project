Laying with me in silent sleep
Laying still forever
My heart has lost its will
My soul its desire
Growing in my sickness
A growing need

Lay with me in silent sleep
Laying still forever
Tasting the stench
From your thigh
Cleansing myself
Inside you

Broken me
I tried to run away
Take my passion

Oh how I loved you
Adorning you with pearls
And my decaying kisses
You were my prize
A beauty a vile whore

Falling through
Falling through
