Touch cold skin
Deep in you
Shine again
For me
Be mine

Taken from me
Love I never knew
Longing to be warm
Alone I wait to die

Calling I hear you cry
Dreaming night after night
Breathless in my arms
Impaled on your fucking cross

Take away my pain
So tired of life without light

Thinking that I held you
Knowing I never would
Her broken body
The sweetness of her skin
I've cried a thousand times
For that which is sick
