Dying for me
Nails driven through you
The dirt from you makes me sick
I know the pain
It bears down
On my back

Holding a loveless shell
Love me
I wish I could believe

Crying for her
Pleading for life
These things I know
From now I'll be alone

Sleeping by your body
Needing to feel you breathe
Will I die with your name
On my lips
I long to see
And can see no more
Those I hate loved
And can love no more

Caressing her broken back
As you looked on
Then walked away
How can you say I'm not alone
It's every day of my life
