Born bleeding
I am for the last time
As I lay here dying
On my bed of thorns
For all but everything
I would have lost my life for you
If you were to take it away
A release from this pain

Mother make me pain
More than I could ever know
Feeling for something
You took my life

And the thorns they tore into me
Searing into my skin

You swore again and again
Please leave me alone
And the thorns they tore into me
Searing into my eyes

I won't pray to you
But I don't want to die
Godless and bound

I hope that you feel
The pain that I felt
I hope you never see
Things that I left
