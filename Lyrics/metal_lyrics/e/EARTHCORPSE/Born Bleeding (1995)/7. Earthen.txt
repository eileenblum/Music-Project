Searing below me
My only child
The only one
Will no one help
Your might all but spent
Flowers of the field
Grey and somehow older
A freshness subdued

I'll always wonder
If I could have changed
And maybe take back
My one true friend

For pity's sake
Don't hurt my earthen child
My only child
Greying cities and concrete skin
Torn between life
Cover the earth with needless filth
I gave to you without question
You took more without asking

Colours fading in the sun
I gave to you with all I know
I was not there

I'll always know
I could have helped
I could have saved
My one true friends

For pity's sake
Don't hurt my earthen child
My only child
Greying cities
And concrete skin
Sallow faces

And empty hearts
