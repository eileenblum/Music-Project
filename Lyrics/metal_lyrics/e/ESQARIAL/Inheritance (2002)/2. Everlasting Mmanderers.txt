Gust of wind on my face as I strut
Dust in throat mile by mile
Everlasting wanderer
Doomed to the eternal exile

Running blindly to the goal
That is as misty as our future
We are driving along at a crawl
But the path we walk doesn't draw to a close

Never will draw to a close

Blinded by a vision of new life
For the hope I sacrifice my youth
From nodding I feel the pain in my neck
I am the one who was proved right in the end

I know the legend will come true
Sail to discover something new
We're walking in through open door
Leaving the world rotten to the core
Drop of water on the desert's sands
All the rage captured in one cell
In the darkness lives the stream of light
To build "New Heaven" I find power in my own hell

My own private hell
