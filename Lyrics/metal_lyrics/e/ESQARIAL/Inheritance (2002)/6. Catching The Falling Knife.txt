In the shade of skyscrapers
Live the children of crisis
Their minds are absorptive
Fed with empty promises

Catch the falling knife
In captivity the animals rarely thrive
Wealth whets appetite
For victory in this unequal fight
Who's gonna cease this nightmare
Only the strongest will survive
They put their hands in the air
To catch the falling knife

Classification of priorities
The obligation of receiving the highest fees

Devaluation of our points of view
Denomination of the law and rules
Observe the fluctuation of the sense
Bumptious speeches to close our emotional balance
