[Verse:]
Black or white, death or life, Satan - God
Destruction, creation, right or wrong

[Verse1:]
Grave or torch, fire and water, earth and air

Heaven and hell, inmortality and death, silence and noise, darkness and light, hush and scream
Sadness and glee, love and hate, fortune - bad luck, fight or give, future and past, reality - dream!!!

[Verse2:]
Outbreak of war, light and noise, explosion
Survivors, hunger and death, radiation

[Chorus:]
Every night, every day, deathlike silence
The end of world, the end of civilization

[Verse &amp; Verse 1]

[Solo: Pajak]
It'll remains only powder and dust, some people will restore a human race
No countries, no cities, without divisions, it's only the last battle for their life

[Solo: Pajak]

They lost by pride and greed of some of us, primitive tests of human resistance
Now teaching theirselves to live without hate that this situation will never repeat

[Verse &amp; Verse2]

[Chorus]
