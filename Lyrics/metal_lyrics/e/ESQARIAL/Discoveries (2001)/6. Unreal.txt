I'm the system, I'm the law, I'm corruption, worm in the core
I'll tell you everything, the best of lies, the Prince of wounds, the Lord of Flies

[Verse:]
No one hears the scream, faceless crawling fear
Dead voices speak through me of all the things they see

[Chorus:]
Lie back and dream of me, red death to set you free     
Black terror stalks the night, I turn the screws to make you die

[Verse]

[Verse2:]
You hope it's only a dream, despair - you can't resist
No one knows your name, learn to fight the pain
Wonder - worker, doing death, killing all, friends and foes
Wonder - worker, from the dream, create evil, it's nightmare

[Solo: Pajak]
[Solo: Vitt]

[Chorus, Verse &amp; Verse2]
