Fighting for money, fighting for death, shaking the enemy, beaten and shamed
Riding fast out the sunset, devils and horses advance
Thunder and lightning and honour, the army of sabre and lance
Destroying and laughing and slaying, leather and metal and blood
Death is the lie we are living, hungry for battle and war

Digging the graves for enemy, for us, it's our future, the planed suicide

[Chorus:]
World in flames - what remains after conflicts
World in flames - how to stop nonsensical wars
World in flames - where's going the humans race
World in flames - it looks like Armageddon

[Solo: Pajak]

Howling pain burn like sun, out of break black inside
Evil grins, creep and crawl, lost the race, cancer grown
[missed lyrics]

[Chorus]
