Your life was my nightmare, suffocate, muted, crushed your burden...
Existence...The end of your life become my obssesion...
The purpose which I wanted, desire to live for, I released by you by killing you
Forever you're gone!!!

[Solo: Pajak]

"...in pain I cried for my beloved" - Joy, relief, realization of life mission

Huge hangover was a blessing, alone to forget about you,
Not what I've done I still stick knife in your heart once again

And you still come back, worse...uglier...and more and more I hate you!!!

Blood on my hands - hot, uncongealed...I revel in the view in the thought that you've gone
I killed and I'll do it again, I'll kill my nightmare!!!
