Look into the face of danger, I know how to make a dead
I don't want to make a deal, might be murdered in your bed

[Chorus:]
Make them deaf, make them blind - Tooth for tooth, eye for eye [x2]
Make them die [x2]

Don't touch me when I'm dead, can't believe that I'm here
Cold in the arms of the dead, leave me now, admit your fear

I know all the words of power, all about the witching hour
I know the reason why you're scared and here comes your nightmare

[Chorus]

[Solos: Pajak]

Wake up, don't run, I'm here, I came to kill you my dear
You could start to dig your grave, slaughter in the room, make my bleeding day
I'd like to feel a pleasure to kill, easy to be cruel, hard to be kind
Tell me what do you feel, your slowly death is make me glad

[Chorus]

[Verse]
