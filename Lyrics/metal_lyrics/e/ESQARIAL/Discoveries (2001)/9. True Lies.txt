The sacred wars, the crusades, the nation's terminate and all done in my name
I decided their fate, thousand years of misery, years of torture in my name
Your eyes will adorn my crown, Your bones will build my palaces
Christianity - go to the church - Pray to your God - for victims
Fall to the knees - kiss the cross - Listen the God's words - created by me

[Solo: Vitt]

I rule over the world, I create the truth you believe
I create your morality, I decide your fate

I'm emperor of lies and I'm creator of truth
My name is religion, I'm the politician

Thousand years of misery, years of torture in my name
I'll lead you to your destiny, I'll lead you to your grave

[Solo: Pajak]
