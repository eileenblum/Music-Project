Black sun emerged from behind the clouds
And brought anxiety to this quiet town
When cobweb sticks to shattered fragments of their dreams
Daylight exposes filth
In secret the night covers up all sins

In darkness
We cast no shadow
In loneliness
There's no one we could follow

Engineers of soul
Make you feel so small
A cog in the machine

Distrust is the only friend that helps them to survive
Behind the door that's locked up whispers, screams and fights
Their misty premonitions sowed the seed of fear
Old clock is ticking louder
Reminding us that the harvest is near

All anger washed away with the tide
I wish the time was on my side
The frozen gesture, a carving knife
In rear-view-mirror all my life

It's the timequake...
