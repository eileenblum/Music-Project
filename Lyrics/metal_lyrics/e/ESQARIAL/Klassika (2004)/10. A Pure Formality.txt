[In memory of Wojciech Seweryn]

Night, fear takes its form
Filling my mind
And all that was certain is gone
I touch the wood and smile to my thoughts
This path won't lead me home

[Chorus:] Pictures of past closed in the hand
Unfinished chapter of life
Reminiscence of a place I belong
Won't never sink into oblivion

He had the right, you had the law
I unclench my fists and talk to the stone
Thrown to the wolves, commited no crime
The only real thing that I know is

TIME - deadly consequence
without a word of protest
shadow of doubt
stream with no source

I close my eyes I can feel no pain
Fragile as old painting without frame
I need no guide to where I roam
The last part of this trip I'll walk alone

[Chorus:] Pictures of past closed in the hand
Unfinished chapter of life
Reminiscence of a place I belong
Pack your bags, sign here it's pure formality
