Extremely flammable
You set your ears to the sound
That's indescribable
Like red light for the colourblind

You bribe your vanity
Thirsty curiousity
Smolders silently
Ready to explode
It's time to seize the day
Your senses are taking rest
By sleeping in the flame

Swallowed bitterness
Sinking in the nameless crowd
He never asked for forgiveness
Standing on the wrong side of the barrel
Standing on wrong side

Make God laugh by telling him about your plans

You bribe your vanity
Thirsty curiousity
Smolders silently
Ready to explode
It's time to seize the day
Your senses are taking rest
By sleeping in the flame

Extremely flammable
You set your ears to the sound
That's indescribable
Red light for the colourblind
He never asked for forgiveness
Standing on the wrong side of the barrel
Standing on wrong side

Make god laugh by telling him about your plans
