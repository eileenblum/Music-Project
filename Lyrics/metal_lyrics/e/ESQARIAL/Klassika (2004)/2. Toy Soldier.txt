Wrong choice's been made
And I should have taken chance
Instead of being on both sides of the fence
When soaking wet I find the shelter from the rain
The victory's claimed but life is slowly draining away

Head or tails? Not a game
In this crowd you feel alone

Save your skin Pretend to win
World's just a stage that we act upon

Playing dead I cut thread
To keep me away from all the things you've said
A bigger part of wishbone's pulled
By those who always scream for more
After the whole damn trip I've drowned almost reaching the shore

Vengeance
Tastes better when served cold

Lunatic Lie in ambush
God knows I must get even with you

Fed with the promises
Honour and pride
This is your big chance my little boy
Now everything's painted black
Fetters are broken
One word never spoken
That old dog can only bark

Head or tails? Not a game
In this crowd you feel alone

Save your skin Pretend to win
World's just a stage that we act upon

Courage Is what you're made of
Now I'm weak and feel betrayed

Stabbed in the back
Toy soldier who's always been a cannon-fodder
