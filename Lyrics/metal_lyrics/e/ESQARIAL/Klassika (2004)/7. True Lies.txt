All seeing eyes
Everyday
Pierce through the walls

Stream of pompous words
Empty sentences
Drown out vigilance

It's still the same sick rhythm
Makes us join parade

Buy yourself invisibility
To evade the glance

Sin of greed
Stains cleaned conscience again
In the shadow of raised hand

You are skating on thin ice
Read between the lies

Lifting the veil of secrecy
You will be consumed with anger and jealousy

Blind obedience, taken vow
Truth of unit vs truth of crowd

Come at my call
Creators of Leaders your cradle will fall
