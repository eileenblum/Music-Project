Hiding mystery in my head
I avoid the arms that with pleasure
Would welcome my surrender

I can't even trust my eyes
Tunnel with no end
The path I walked is paved with fear
And too winding to understand that all I need is to reach out
For brighter side of the dark

Behind the mask
Hypocrisy
Night is come
Day is done
Once blood has been drawn
There's always a need

Before the curtain of night will fall
With its heaviness
Before the lamp will project a trembling silhouettes
I'll sneak into your head to steal your happiness
