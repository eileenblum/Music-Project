Obsession- it's all your life
Obsession- chained the mind
Obsession- the war with yourself
Obsession- obsession 

Don't kill the true
The evil is inside you
Go to dance with the fire
Don't block up your desire 

You place your trust
In an invisible man
You must understand
That's a mistake 

Fear before your God
Will reign over you
Fear before your God
Will kill you 

The pearly gate
Is not a true
Your life is waiting
For your move 

Fear before your God
gets poisoned your life
Fear before your God
Fills your mind
