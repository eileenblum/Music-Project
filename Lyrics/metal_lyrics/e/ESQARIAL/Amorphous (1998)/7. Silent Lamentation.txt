Was it a great sin that I was born
I haven't hurt anybody yet
Can't you understand me ï¿½ I exist
And I want to live in happiness 

What do you think where could I escape
Before your view, before your anger
Why am I cold and you're again drunk
Do you've to live me alone in the dark 

Children slowly killed live in fear and pain
Don't understand what you want from them 

What did I do I haven't had a childhood
Is this my fault that I was created 

Children slowly killed live in fear and pain
Will be in the future our only way
The fruits of life, the flowers of life
So starved, so lean and still naive 

I didn't deserve such a treatment
For the five years of my life
