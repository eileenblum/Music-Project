What do you feel when you look at me
Don't you think that it's happened already 

All those faces are looking for a
something new
Is this somebody who can amaze them 

I think I've seen it somewhere,
An awaiting crowd
What may I give them to make them glad
Does a verse read from the Holy Book suffice them 

The silence of graveyard caves
The whispers of cryptic tales 

There are the two realms of shadows
First in hell, second on this land
And in the simply way
Satan must watch yourself 

Graveyard caves...
