Fascinated by the nothingness
Conquered by the vision of the decay
I'm looking for my lady
The queen of life and death

She has come in the white
She has knocked to my door
I feel the nearness
She is my companion

Plunge the steel edge on my breast
Where my heart is rapping
Close in the cage forever
Waiting for your help

Close my eyelids the last time
Make me your eternally servant
Make me the patron of death
Make me cold and make dead

Defeated before my time
Destroyed by the brutal side of life
I'm waiting for my lady
The queen of life and death

The heart has stopped and with it time
I feel the death's nearness
The dead man life eternally
I'm forever youngI'm forever young
