Don't abandon yourself to the grief
Don't fall to an abeyance
Don't give up cause you're young
Fight with your second side 

Don't waste your time for other things
Don't wait for a requiem
Don't hide yourself by the cross
Fight with your own demons 

Thinking about my life
Thinking about the past time
Waiting for the answer from God
Waiting for the end of the world 

Fighting for my right to life
Fighting for the justice
Thinking about Devil's deeds
Creating my own reality 

Let's blessed the man
Who has won with his pain
Who has taken the possession of his fear
Who hasn't sold his skin 

Researching for the other side
Wishing to my self a long life
Awakeing in the wall's shadow
Living in my own world
