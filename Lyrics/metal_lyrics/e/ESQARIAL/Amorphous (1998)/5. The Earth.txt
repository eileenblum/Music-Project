The meadows' green, the flowers' smell
The sun's brightness on the sky
Birds' are returning to their sides
And searching for forsaken nests 

Only for you my mother Earth
Only for you I'm coming back
And my heart's beating like not my own
I want to see my natal home 

I've sought other places, but I couldn't find
myself
My soul has still gone astray
I've desired your death, at least I've still loved
you
I've dreamed about the doomsday 

An eagle is winging in mountain
He's seeking a refuge for him
I'd like to reach the sky with wings
If I could get the wings from him 

I feel the land under my feet
I listen to the flowed stream
Why did nobody help me
When I've heard only my own scream
