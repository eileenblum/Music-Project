Lost and scared it's cold
I'm lying on the ground
Before this scene
My sketch of life was different

Free from the pain
It seems that life is ending
I hear your voice
You wait inside my head

I am everywhere but I'm far away
I am falling apart
Descending from this world
Determined to fight against my destiny
I am losing control
And I'm losing it to you

Your presence eats my skin
You're waiting in the dark
I feel your scent
You wait for me to come

I am everywhere but I'm far away
I am falling apart
Descending from this world
Determined to fight against my destiny
I am losing control
And I'm losing it to you

Every time I see, you're waiting for me
Starting to lose my gravity
I'm losing control

I am everywhere but I'm far away
(I am falling apart)
Descending from this world

I am everywhere but I'm far away
I am falling apart
Descending from this world
Determined to fight against my destiny
I am losing control
And I'm losing it to you
