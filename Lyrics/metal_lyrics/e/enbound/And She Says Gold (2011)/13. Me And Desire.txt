Haunted by desire, the anguish takes in
Controlled by demons, I must give in

Fly into a place
I just died
Can you see the world with my eyes
It's a beautiful scene

But I have tasted what can be unreal
Carried by angels flying free

I am gone, going by, fading out
I'm lost and scared, but I'm real, passing on
Space will need the stars

Fear, thrusting by, drowning in
Can someone help me?
I scream
Can't you hear?
I'm dragged to the edge

Master of desire
I'm the king in the ring
Control the demons, you must give in

Fly into a place
I just died
Can you see the world with my eyes
It's a glorious scene

But I have tasted what can be unreal
Carried by angels flying free
I am...

I'm locked outside this door, the secrets are left inside
I suffer in silence, my screams are all in vain
My tears are falling, more than the rain

Don't take the wings from an angel
I'm fearless with you
I'm fearless without you
Don't drag me down, I want to stay!

I am gone, going by, fading out
I'm lost and scared, but I'm real, passing on
Space will need the stars

Fear, thrusting by, drowning in
Can someone help me?
I scream
Can't you hear?
I'm moved to the edge

Fear, thrusting by, drowning in
Can someone help me?
I scream, can't you hear?
I'm dragged to the edge

I am gone, going by, fading out
I'm lost and scared, but I'm real, passing on
Space will need the stars

I am gone, going by, fading out
I'm lost and scared, but I'm real, passing on
Space will need the stars

Fear, thrusting by, drowning in
Can someone help me?
I scream, can't you hear?
I'm dragged to the edge

I am gone, going by, fading out
I'm lost and scared, but I'm real, passing on
Space will need the stars
