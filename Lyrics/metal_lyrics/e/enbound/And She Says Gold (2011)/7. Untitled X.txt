She turned around, then she walked away
I'm out of flow, tied up once again
Her utter wish; make it brief
It's not with ease, I walk away as well

Awoke by the hidden seeds of life
Just smile and bow down

And I believe, that the secrets ripens up sometimes
Some live in fear, but their senses are blind by tears
The past will be condemned to live again
Live to join the dance of every man
Every man!

I can't deny what I see in you
Dreaming away, watch my ashes turn...
I can't deal with the wounds you left behind
My mind is enbound

I believe, that the secrets ripens up sometimes
Some live in fear, but their senses are blind by tears
The past will be condemned to live again
Live to join the dance of every man

I turn around to the staring maid, and she says gold

...the secrets ripens up sometimes
Some live in fear, but their senses are blind by tears
The past will be condemned to live again
Live to join the dance of every man

I believe, that the secrets ripens up sometimes
Some live in fear, but their senses are blind by tears
The past will be condemned to live again
Live to join the dance of every man
