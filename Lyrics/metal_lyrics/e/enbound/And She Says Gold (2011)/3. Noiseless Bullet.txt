Speeding towards me, noiseless, not a sound
A racing bullet, comes to take me out
Eyes are spread, my bodyâs paralyzed
My chest is pierced; Iâm marked for all of time

I feel my veins are flooded
Forever memorized deep in my soul

Leaving me in phases, wondering how
(Iâm) lost in pain, is this goodbye
All my faces figures nothing out
As Iâm left alone

Swirling pictures take my lungs but I breathe
To make the fight I stay outside my dreams
I am searching, hunting, high and low
For my strength to carry on and on for more

I feel my veins are flooded
Forever memorized deep in my soul

Leaving me in phases, wondering how
(Iâm) lost in pain, is this goodbye
All my faces figures nothing out
As Iâm left alone
