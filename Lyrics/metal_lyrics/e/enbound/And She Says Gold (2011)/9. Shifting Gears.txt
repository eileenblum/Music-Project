Empowered I achieve
To mold you obsolete
A portrait of the devil
Righteous angel has descent

Shifting gears, I have no doubt
The beauty of flames
You melt before my glory

The colors of anger, desaturated
Beneath the water, never to surface

Blood in your mouth!

Treason, the wildest of decisions
Misleading, beginning of departure

Lies, speeches of fortune
The beauty of flames
You melt before my glory

The concept of anger, desaturated
Beneath the water, never to surface

Blood in your mouth!

Blood in your mouth!
