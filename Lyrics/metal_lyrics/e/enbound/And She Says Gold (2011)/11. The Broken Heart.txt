The feeling has begun
It rides upon the broken heart
Flies in me
When i see it once again
I'll make you believe it's not the end.
With cries in me
I see it once again
I'll make you believe it's not the end.

I'm craving for the door to open
I'm locked out in the dark
So close but still so far.
I light up candles
Hate this way it had falled out to sleep
I leave this world for you.

The feeling has begun
It rides upon the broken heart
It dies in me
I'll never see you again
I'll make you believe it's not the end.

Its rhymes in me
I see you once again
I'll make you believe it's not the end.
