I feel your scent
It shivers down my spine
I am blind
Please don't make me see.

I feel alive
Crashed into a wall
No more lies
Obsession and pain is gone
It's gone!

Every time when I am lost in the dark
You will guide me to the right path

Love has come, you make me strong
I can feel it in my heart
Spare this time, yor're in my mind
I feel it in my heart

Every time when I am lost in the dark
You will guide me to the right path

Love has come, you make me strong
I can feel it in my heart
Spare this time, you're in my mind
I feel it in my heart

(Love has come)
Love has come, (you make me strong)
I can feel it in my...
I'm longing to be... I'm lost to you!
(Spare this time,) you're in my mind
I feel it in my heart
