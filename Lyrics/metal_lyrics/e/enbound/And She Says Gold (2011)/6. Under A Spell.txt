I am walking through a strange dark forest
Hungry and tired all alone
My friends was taken by the troops, I saw it
I can see the slaughter in my head

Voices from nowhere is calling my name
Shadows from creatures they make me insane

Under a spell and a long way from home
The madman is my compass
Where he takes me I donât know

I am trapped inside this evil nightmare
I can feel the pain inside of me
I left my homeland, for this crazy mission
This must be a tragic comedy

Voices from nowhere is calling my name
Shadows from creatures they make me insane

Under a spell and a long way from home
The madman is my compass
Where he takes me I donât know

All our lives, we have trained so hard
I ask myself, whatâs the meaning now

Wives in tears, they are all alone
They cry in silence, just what went wrong

Iâm lost in reality
I can see them die
I can hear them in pain
I feel that someone is watching me

The cost is humanity
I can hear them die
I can see them in pain
I know that someone is watching me

Watching you!
