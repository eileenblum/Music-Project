I see the light, down my sight
Lifting all of me, to your heart
Before this day, I nearly fell away
But your voice, made me rise

You, you are the meaning
Climbing high, to the conquest of life
Could it be? We'll be there, like we've chosen?
Wonderings, memories, frozen to be...

Surrounded by clouds who cry of joy
They know that, we are true
Looking ahead, of ponder I'm fed
I love you, I do!

You, you are the meaning
Climbing high, to the conquest of life
Could it be? We'll be there, like we've chosen?
Wonderings, memories, frozen to be...

I saw the light, down my sight
Now we are, frozen too...
