Make believe
Nothing is real until you feel it
It all comes clear
The future's in our hands

I've been falling down the stairs again
Screaming in vain
I paint the world, I shape you

I am longing to be with you
I am lost to you
Right between life and illusion
I see through you

Confess to lie
Nothing is perfect and nothing is right
I close my eyes
Withering away

I've been falling down the stairs again
Screaming in vain
I paint the world, I shape you

I am longing to be with you
I am lost to you
Right between life and illusion
I see through you

I am longing to be with you
I am lost to you
Right between life and illusion
I see through you

Since the shadows falling down on me
Colors flaking, I can not see
The dream I have is mine
Why can't you be the sign?

Right between life and illusion.

I am longing to be with you
I am lost to you
Right between life and illusion
I see through you
