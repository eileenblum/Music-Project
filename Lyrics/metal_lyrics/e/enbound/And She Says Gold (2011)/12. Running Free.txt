Running free, Iâm running free
Face to face with me
Iâm running free, running free
I am drifting far away

When pride is falling down and leaving me out
And face to face with this no breathing sight
I see them moving rapidly away, ohah!
And follow them into the light

Your recipe to life has changed
A twisted action alter me inside
When faces growing in my skin â no, ohah!
Theyâre moving rapidly but Iâm running free

â¦running free
Face to face with me
Iâm running free, running free
I am drifting far away

When you are falling down and leaving me here
Iâm facing me with new believes, no fear
All demons chasing, hunting me away, ohah!
Theyâre moving rapidly but Iâm running free

Running free, Iâm running free
Face to face with me
Iâm running free, running free
Iâm drifting far from me

Running free, Iâm running free
Face to face with me
