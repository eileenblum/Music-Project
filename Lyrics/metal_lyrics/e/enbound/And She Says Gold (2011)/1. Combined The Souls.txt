The clouds begin to fade away
The sun will shine again
But I am left in a desert of pain
It's seems I've lost this game

[bridge:]
Now I'm standing all alone
Alone with all the memories I cry

[chorus:]
So close every time I see you
My mind is so far away
I have secrets untold to your face
I want to combined the souls

I want to hold on to our past
No more questions asked
I paint our destiny in the sand
And frame it in at last

[bridge]

I cry

[chorus]

[chorus]
