Come along with the last rays of light
Catch a last glimpse of the unknown ones

A shot of hatred - raise our minds to fight
And compel us into glory ride

Soon we all will be heroes
On the morrow of war

Light the sky - A fire inside
Unleashing the end, where no one survive
Ride out - Encouraged to fight
Now rise to his call and deny

Prophets sighs in dust and chilling winds
While we keep on counting days and sins
Make your moves in silence
Shaped in black-to-gold-gold-to-black-black-to-gold (black!)
As your slaves are on the road again

Soon we all will be heroes
On the morrow of war

Light the sky - A fire inside
Unleashing the end, where no one survive
Ride out - Encouraged to fight
Now rise to his call and deny

We're close to the edge
That turned a heart to stone
Even though we are free
I have to walk your way

Light the sky - A fire inside
Unleashing the end, where no one survive
Ride out - Encouraged to fight
Now rise to his call and deny
