[Demo 2008 track]

I feel forsaken there is no God
If I canât reach heaven then lets try mud
No one mourns if I die
My whole life is a lie

Death is dawning
My tears are falling
Death is calling

I close my eyes and fall into eternity
All my visions are gone
I take a deep breath and fall into infinity
This time Iâm all alone
Iâm all alone

Nothing can stop me my time has come
A voice deep inside screams lets get it done
No more pain if I die
No more cries no more lies

Death is dawning
My tears are falling
Death is calling

I close my eyes and fall into eternity
All my visions are gone
I take a deep breath and fall into infinity
This time Iâm all alone
Iâm all alone
