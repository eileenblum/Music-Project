The walls of memories release the enemy
I'm my own rival, strength and inhumanity
All is closed in the smallest place
In amorphous delusions, all are ashes of a lonely face

With sadness, I look at my wicked skin
But never fall and never kneel
I could strongly try, striped sorrow and defy
But inside... is the emptiness which I feel

I'm falling following you
I'm the tear of loss running through
I'm crawling like you do
I'm the mask that speaks for you

I fade in the paradox of delight
All the journeys embrace a bitter truth in pale sight
Perfection lies on the unborn
And joy is the shadow of the indifference

The comforts of a tasteless shadow is so thin
Never will be, as I would like to see
I could strongly try, scream anger in goodbye
But inside... is the emptiness which I feel

I'm falling following you
I'm the tear of loss running through
I'm crawling like you do
I'm the mask that speaks for you
