Three of four smiles
In a half hour bit
Disguising within
Disrupting a dark sheet

(They say) come never again
Worthlessness inside
Ornamenting my soul
With tears that doesn't dry

The clock sings... undressing my bitterness
I hear it in shock... I have no answers
How many smiles do I have to breed?
To exhale the soul of this limonin kiss

The last of four smiles
Of a half hour hope
Masking times dwelled
Purging the reasons felt

Striping tears inside
With a half opened eye
Hearing and fearing
The malfunctions of mind

The clock sings... undressing my bitterness
I hear it in shock... I have no answers
How many smiles do I have to breed?
To exhale the soul of this limonin kiss
