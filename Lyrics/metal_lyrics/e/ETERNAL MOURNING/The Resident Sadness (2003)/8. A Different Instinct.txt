Darkness comes, fear has arrived
Hordes wondering lost in a different time
Horrified face on the edge of madness
Crawling over cold sharpened rocks

Blood is the only boundary, accidental
A survival instinct prevails
Dictates integration
Against natural rebellion

Burning to ashes
All surrounders
Nothing but fear
No morphine present
Only acts of faith
Agonizing chains, hunger and aggression
Lesser children
Mutilated bodies of nature
A wicked mother
A gained death, unnoticed, brutal
Cruel mutilation
A different spell
A different instinct of fear
Rare beauty, rare love

Ugly rage, again despair
Magic initiation, dangerous rituals
Of pain and unconsciousness
Expected sacrifice
With purpose of creation
Strange anger to be satisfied

Fire, endless pursuit for deadly weapons
Mastered creation, mastered it's possession

Rival tribes, the symbol of an early death
And the doubt of agonizing eyes
Should be expected
A point of light will be kept
The cost will be life, will be death
Strange wondered faces
Cannibals for nothing
Cannibals for nothing
In the end, life stands
Cannibals for nothing
