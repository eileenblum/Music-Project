Nothing is shared now
The emptiness erased all sounds
As time sew the poison inside
I sense a silent grief undressing wide

In my resident sadness
A friendly smile stays for a while
The door is forever closed
Restraining the mourning inside

The bitter elements are concentrate
Damaging life, erasing fate
The humble eyes paint deep the pain line
Drowning blood in the sad clouds entwine

Does anyone understand loneliness?
The pale whiteness of destiny...
The strength of all that stands is going away
While the fire insight ends humanity

Does anyone understand humanity?

In my resident sadness
A friendly smile stays for a while
The door is forever closed
Restraining the mourning inside
