I know that nothing has a future
But sometimes it's so difficult to drown hope
Even when thoughts paint all emotions black
There is a second where you can dream and simply...

(Without regret) forget...
And feed the flow inside...

I can sense the sterile skin of future
Reviving every wound in my existence
A fragile splendour of youth I behold within
But the hopeless mask is still so vulnerable and thin

(Without regret) forget...
And feed the flow inside...

The grief of emptiness inside sings my silence
I'm just here screaming for ignorance...
