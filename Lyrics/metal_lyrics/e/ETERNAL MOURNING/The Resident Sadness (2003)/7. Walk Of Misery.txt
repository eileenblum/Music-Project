Is this a sign I feel?
It's a dark blink in my will?
The thorns are under my skin
Rapping sadness, leaving anger within

I draw the sorrow of mankind
Illustrating oblivion on sad smiles
Leaving everything in synchronicity
Nothing deserves but the shine of misery

I can breed...
I can burn...
I'm the murmur in the empty shell
The echo that will eternally dwell

I can hide...
I can obscure...
Everything lives indefinitely
On this walk of misery

I'm getting near where you're now
Far down within your soul
I see life through your eyes
Composing in you the sorrow's word

I can breed...
I can burn...
I'm the murmur in the empty shell
The echo that will eternally dwell

I can hide...
I can obscure...
Everything lives indefinitely
Because I'm your misery
