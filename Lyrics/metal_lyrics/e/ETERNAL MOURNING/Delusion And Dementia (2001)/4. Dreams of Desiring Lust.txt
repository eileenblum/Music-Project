Through the pale shades
Of the daring night
A dazzling figure
Shines so bright

Swift as the wind
In a white satin dress
I hunger for the touch
Of her sweet caress

A perfume so intense
As no other I ever sensed
Now tie me to this ground
I should've never found

Goddess of my fantasies
Reveal to me thy splendor
Undress your body fast
Set free thy soul at last
Undress your body fast
Set free thy soul at last

Mistress I call now call you
Like a thousand others tried
With my heart in these hands
I'm chained to your wishes... Until I die
