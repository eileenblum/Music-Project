Colorless scars on shapeless faces
Feed sadness till the ending day
Where time cant freely run
Because is to old to recreate the past moments of pain

Above time lives the moment soul
For each second forgot, one memory refolds
For each lament loved, one kiss was saved...
...Only shared with the grace of the ones that time beholds

Time is what we are...
...Long is the night that brings the vision
And long is beauty that carries the light...
...I'm sorry about the smile
