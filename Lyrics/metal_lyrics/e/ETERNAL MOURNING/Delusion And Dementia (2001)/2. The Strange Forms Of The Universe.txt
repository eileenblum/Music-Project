A journey into your eyes
Brings all the insanity of your strange mourning light
A new universe, so infinitely large, grabs me to the illusion sight
Where love folds back on itself with the braids of one more lonely night

My devitalised boundless soul
Sails around your galaxy
Loosing all senses on this endless cosmos
Without that illusion of infinity! ...

Looking up at your sky,
I feel the blindness forever....
A world of dark fantasy ...the pain as pure energy
Seeking covenant in dark constellations,
(Endless Ocean for endless damnation)
Where intrinsic brightness reflects the hopelessness of a distant dimension

A journey into your eyes
Brings me to a new universe
The source of an intrinsic reality
Blinded under the skin of my soul and disharmony
Who's the grace consumes the strong
For the no long shining of the antipodes kiss.....
Sa gracieusetc consomme le fort
Pour la brillance perdue du baiser antipode
