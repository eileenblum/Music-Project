So far seems to be your face
Now that fate take us apart
So long is the ranging river
That stands before our hearts

Gone seems to be the time
When you were a part of me
And within my mourning heart
I remember all that shall never be...

Solitude of mine take me in your arms
With the treads of my shattered dreams
Solitude of mine take me in your arms
Sow my life this time...

As queen of autumn wind
Releases her gentle breathe
And she whispers into my ear
The words of my regret

They flow like broken leaves
To a place I shall never see
Leaving me behind to stand alone
With my memories...

Solitude of mine take me in your arms
With the treads of my shattered dreams
Solitude of mine take me in your arms
Sow my life this time...
