Breathing underwater, Living under glass
The world is turning faster, spinning everyday
Night will know my name, in endless circles chant
Never hear from me again, I bid my last farewell

Dream with me, drowning, in a sea of tears
Longing to be free
Dream with me, drowning, in a sea of tears
Farewell to you, and me

And what I leave behind, a script and nothing more
For countless days I've wandered, nothing left to see
My empty body stands, at rest my mind released
This path yet seems so strange, still I can't resist

I bare all that I am, not just a simple man
Options don't occur to me, when hanging by a thread

Dream with me, drowning, in a sea of tears
Longing to be free
Dream with me, drowning, in a sea of tears
Farewell to you, and me

I bare all that I am, not just a simple man
Options don't occur to me, when hanging by a thread

Dream with me, drowning, in a sea of tears
Longing to be free
Dream with me, drowning, in a sea of tears
Farewell to you, and me
