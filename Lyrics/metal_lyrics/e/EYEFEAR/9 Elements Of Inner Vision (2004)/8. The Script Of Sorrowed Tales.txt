A web of dreams out in haunted seas, and the picture reminds me of you
Behind a veil, the face of an angel, the object of beauty and truth
And all of  my life I'll be haunted, just that one moment in time
I won't understand just what went through my mind, my mind.......

The crack of DAWN brings all new fears, for my blinded eyes to see
Digging in darkness and showing no fear, of the danger that lies up ahead
So many times said you'd only be mine, gave my blood sweat and tears,
So you can only see, so you can only see through my eyes....!

Then you slipped away, to another domain
Where no-one can reach you
Your locked safe inside

Drink now from my golden cup, I'll bring life into your sorrowed heart
Take my hand into the night we'll fly for DAWNS, the beginning of life
Silence reigns as the night grows cold, the master of illusion has taken my soul
He controls me like a puppet on strings...!

Then you slipped away to another domain
Where no-one can reach you
Your locked safe inside

Open your eyes
Don't leave me behind
I'm lost on the outside
Until I feel your pain
YOUR PAIN...!

Embrace your inner child
Open your eyes and your mind
Cherish this gift that is life
And I'll be by your side
Now you should be sleeping, but your eyes say your AWAKE !
Tell me what your dreaming of....
Tell me what your dreaming of....
Tell me what your dreaming of....

Then you slipped away to another domain
Where no-one can reach you
Your locked safe inside.
