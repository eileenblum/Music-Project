She sits and stares at her reflection
With vacant eyes and a tireless smile
Slowly fading out of our existence
She hears a voice from a sound inside

A flash of light, and you say goodnight
You tasted the poison that is of this life
The winds cry through the forest, calling out to you
But you're lack of comprehension has me totally confused
So now you are transcending, an image of you
There's a river that's crying, a dark shade of blue

Open eyes, see what's yet to come
Tired eyes reflect on what has gone
And you chase you're tail, in an endless maze
Where the storm clouds divide, to relieve the pain

A flash of light, and you say goodnight
You tasted the poison that is of this life
The winds cry through the forest, calling out to you
But you're lack of comprehension has me totally confused
So now you are transcending, an image of you
There's a river that's crying, a dark shade of blue 

And now you search yourself
For what you seek to find
And when you're eyes are finally open
You see you have no place to hide

I sit in the hallway, my head in my hands
And a vision of her that I can't understand
Why would she do this, where has she gone
Should I go with her, or go on alone

The winds cry through the forest, calling out to you
But you're lack of comprehension has me totally confused
So now you are transcending, an image of you
There's a river that's crying, a dark shade of blue
