He awakens from a dream to a cold and lonely room
Sending shivers down his spine memories rush into his mind
His eyes have seen such madness the torment of silent tears
And everywhere he turns and looks their way
Images from the past they make his life a misery
Till you wish yourself away
Surrounded in the dreamscape, underneath the bluest skies
The purist of emotions, are streaming into your blackened mind
He heads of to a place where he once dreamed

Searching for something he can't quite reach
Searching for something where he once dreamed
Searching for something where he once dreamed

Looking through your eyes I see the bearing of your soul
A place reserved entirely for you
Use your illusion and let it take you, to the visions of what you seek
The wind is knocking at the door, flames are low, the fires burning out
He hears the voices, coming in the distance, and waits for them to come

He heads of to a place where he once dreamed
Searching for something where he once dreamed
Searching for something where he once dreamed

Surrounded in your blackened mind
Underneath the bluest skies
The purist of emotions
Are screaming into your blackened mind
Surrounded in the dreamscape
Underneath the bluest skies
The purist of emotions
Are screaming into your blackened mind
Into your blackened mind
