All alone left with memories
My mind casts a shadow of insanity
Helplessly I gaze
Helplessly I gaze
Into a time so far away
I reach for the light yet only
Darkness surrounds me
Darkness surrounds me

Beyond the twilight 
Beyond the twilight

Even silence has a voice of it's own
Inside the subconscious of my mind
There lies a hidden truth
A device of horror
Free me from this misery
Guide me back from insanity
Darkness surrounds me
Darkness surrounds me

Beyond the twilight 
Beyond the twilight I roam 

Gazing at the stars at night, and deep into infinite skies
In a trance I fall, wondering
What fate lies beyond?

I greet the morning sun
With open hands I feel its warmth
Yet with this ray of light
Only darkness surrounds me
Silent crying without tears
Blinded by my own tranquility
Destiny's calling
Destiny's calling

Beyond the twilight
Beyond the twilight
Beyond the twilightI roam
