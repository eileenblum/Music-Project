There comes a time to close your eyes, to what is real
When the passage beyond unveils, a path to the surreal

Welcome to my fortress tall
Nobody gets inside of these four walls
That's where you'll find me, that's where I'll be
No need to worry, I'm deep within side of me
You say that I've got all this room
And that's how I'll spend my time till I break

Reaching out for shadows, but the ILLUMINATION FADES
Waking up to portraits of another time and place
Something else is waiting, it lingers in the dark
Feeling out from everywhere, my mind and dreams are numb

An itching feeling under the skin
It leaves me blind and paralyzed
Can you see it, can you see how far I've gone

ILLUMINATION FADES
See how far I've gone
ILLUMINATION FADES

I scratch the surface, and tear the skin
But nothing exists or dares to leave
Deja vu written in my own blood
I exist in a slipstream in my own mind
When memories and thoughts collide
A shallow feeling deep inside
It kills me, it drives me insane...!

Abandoned baby left alone
Unhappy and restless, I make death my home
Through sleepless plains dividing my mind

Reaching out for shadows, but the ILLUMINATION FADES
Waking up to portraits , of another time and place
Something else is waiting, it lingers in the dark
Feeling out from everywhere, my mind and dreams are numb

ILLUMINATION FADES
See how far I've gone
ILLUMINATION FADES
