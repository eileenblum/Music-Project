Endless danger
Into the oblivion of hell
Serpents sorcerers
Ascending from below

Angels flying
Demons are close behind
In between two worlds
My soul was dying

Redemption will be yours
When you free your souls
And never to return
To the darkness
You choose the dark
I choose the light
Neither side can run or hide

Ancient lore
Flaming sky
The battle rages
Across the land
Only time will tell
Who will win this war
Judgement day is close at hand
Their souls were dying

Redemption will be yours
When you free your souls
And never to return
To the darkness
You choose the dark
I choose the light
Neither side can run or hide.
