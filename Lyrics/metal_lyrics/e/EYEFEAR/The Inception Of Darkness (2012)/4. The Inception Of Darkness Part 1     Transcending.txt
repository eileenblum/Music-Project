With every step that you take
You feel someone behind you
Never there when you turn around
But watching every move that you make

I'm at the end of the road of regret
Some would call it chose fate
Don't forget that it was my choice
Can't change it now it's too late
And time for me has run out
Here comes my reckoning

Transcending
Crossing over
Adrift out to sea
And watching the world
For eternity

The darkness surrounds me
And shadows are descending
Time is running out
Your spirit has been broken
The dark is on its way
There's no hope in finding the light

Transcending
Crossing over
Adrift out to sea
And watching the world
For eternity.
