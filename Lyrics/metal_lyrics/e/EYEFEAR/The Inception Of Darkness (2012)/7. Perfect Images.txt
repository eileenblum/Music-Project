This is the time, this is the place
Momories of childhood written upon your face
A distant voice is calling and whispers on the wind
An icy hand wraps around your soul

Open your mind
Turn your anger away
Find your light in the dark
And just be you forever more

Frozen in time, shadows from your past
Visions fading from view
Regret has taken its toll
Leaves a wound in your soul
Shattering perfect images
Revealing what's true

Open your mind
Turn your anger away
Find your light in the dark
And just be you forever more.
