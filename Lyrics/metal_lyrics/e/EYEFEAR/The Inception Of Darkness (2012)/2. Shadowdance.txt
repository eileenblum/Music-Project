She's whispering my name
In the middle of the night
She says fortune favours the brave
We are the cause of our blindness
My ghost will never leave
I hold your future in my hands

Should I listen to the crying of an eagle?
Why do I hear the calling of the wolves?

I follow her to an unmarked grave
But when I look for her
She's nowhere to be find
I'm all alone in this unforgiving place
This crying child will steal your soul

She's coming home
Reaching out for me
Shadowdancing
In a lightening storm

Should I listen to the crying of an eagle?
Why do I hear the calling of the wolves?

She's showing me the staircase
That leads to the sky
And say goodbye to this life

She's coming home
Reaching out for me
Shadowdancing
In a lightening storm.
