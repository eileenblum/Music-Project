In the night there's a shining light
Dissapearing in the distance
Happening unknow around
Never seen that face before

Immortal warriors
Here to take me to
That star in the sky

Walked this path a thousand times
I had this feeling once before
Afraid of what's ahead tomorrow
I turn my face towards the sky

Heaven knows I'm coming
One step away from leaving
I'm waiting for the calling
The voice to bring me home

They hide in the darkest night

Immortal warriors
Here to take me to
That star in the sky

White diamonds in the sky
I can feel them watching me
And only now I realize
There's so many other worlds to see

Immortal warriors
here to take me to
That star in the sky.
