Stepping through time
Down a long winding path
Surrounded by a galaxy of stars
The beginning of the end is drawing near
As you realize the nightmare's coming true

Time for retribution
The devils gate is opening
The demons march once again

Awakened to the dawn
Of the cold light of day
A sense of peace that the night is over
Standing on the edge of existence
The borderline between heaven and hell

Time for retribution
The devils gate is opening
The demons march once again

Screaming out to the legions of the sky
Crying out for the angels mercy

Screaming out to the legions of the sky
Crying out for the angels mercy

Screaming out to the legions of the sky
Crying out for the angels mercy
Waiting here for another thousand years.
