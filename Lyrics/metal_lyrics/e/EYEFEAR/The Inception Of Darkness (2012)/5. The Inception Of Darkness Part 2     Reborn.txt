I'm burning within
Eyes open but still I am blinded
This hell I'm trapped in
It keeps pulling me deeper and deeper
I hear his calling - I will steal your soul!!!
Can't see through this dark horizon
I kneel before him - There's no tomorrow!!!
Where are the angels to guide me?

You've fallen
But I am here to share your grief
Just remember why you're running
The dark will soon disappear
Take my hand and follow me

As I reach out for you
Together we will find eternity
To share this dream
I am the angel that won't leave you behind

My burning desires are all that I feel
I have no more fear of what will unfold
Like a flower in the fall I'll be reborn again
Where will I be when I open my eyes?

Tonight will find me
At the end of the road
Tomorrow will see us together
I will catch you if you fall
I'll be there to guide you
I will follow the silver line to heaven
I will find you.
