The perfect forgiveness
The words I long for
I will not fade away
Knowing reality turns to tragedy

Blinding, haunting
Beyond the realm of darkness
Blinding, dawning
Before my eyes

Binding with magic
Following the path of your destiny
Staring at the eyes of madness
Will relinquish your soul

Blinding, haunting
Beyond the realm of darkness
Blinding, dawning
Before my eyes

The land suffers with evil
Their souls will never leave
The land suffers with evil

The world is turning
The stars are aligning
Gods are worshipped
Transformed over time
The glory days
The sanctum tells of another god

Blinding, hauntin
Beyond the realm of darkness
Blinding, dawning
Before my eyes

The land suffers with countless souls
The land suffers with evil
Their souls will never leave.
