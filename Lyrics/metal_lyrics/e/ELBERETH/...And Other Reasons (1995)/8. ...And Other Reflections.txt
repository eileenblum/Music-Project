Time, thousand of thoughts stun me,
and I don't know yet if I prefer the past.
No!!!
Requiem for the innocence, not even I hear
its notes and so near they sounded...
Sometimes, emotions show the dark side of me,
I can't understand my own acts.
Time invites to forget so many little things which talk about me.
No!!!
It's a long time ago, now I see it clearly who deserves an awake...
Sometimes, emotions show the dark side of me
I can't understand my own acts and I close another door.
When trouble invades you.
