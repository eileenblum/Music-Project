Remember, they were something - they sounded here... The notes.
Look there, there's nothing, a leaf falls, only it's another one.
No... Scores in solitude, it's only a heart
showing the retreat in which guards the splinters.
The sound of the silence, harmonies of intimacy
show me the retreat in which I can close my eyes.
Look there, there's nothing.
A fleeting walk among the trust.
A leaf falls, today there's nothing
only the sour taste of not to know why.
A picture, conjures up images of my identity.
I realize that I've seen so many fallen leaves.
