Looking through the pind, I've seen stamped on flowers,
stamped on dreams, too much fears... Where is my smile?
It's raining and across the rain - my past mixes with the landscape
I will not cry again. I'm weak, I've already not strengths,
"You must be strong. Beautiful innocence is weak, crystal innocence
the peaceble garden guards your tears, you must be strong"
Where is my faith? I look to the sky, but it seems no, no to respond
I will not cry again. I'm weak, I've already not strengths,
"In the shadows of this place, the birds sing, your soul sings,
A duet of sadness in the garden, a duet of sadness in your soul".
Looking through the pind, I've seen stamped on flowers,
stamped on dreams, too much fears...
