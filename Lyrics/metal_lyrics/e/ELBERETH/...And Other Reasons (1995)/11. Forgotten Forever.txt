The passage of the time, another emotion falls in an empty bags.
The darkness extends covering a face which feels the dismay.
A wet folio which show; he shout from the inner part of... soul,
in flowery gardens a portrait, drops in a window,
to swim nowhere, and feel the tiredness, and you go down.
To see so near which is so far away it's so deep the hole...
To walk towards the light, to see it more and more falling soul...
In flowery gardens a portrait, drops in a window.
Forgotten forever in the silent dim. Forgotten emotions...
Forgotten forever, so immenses thougths. Forgotten. Why?
