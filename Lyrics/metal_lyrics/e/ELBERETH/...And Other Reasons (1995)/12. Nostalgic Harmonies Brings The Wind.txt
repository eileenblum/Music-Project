Now, when the time has come and the leaves have fallen,
in the eternal autumn of loneliness, in memories I've ever dead.
She's crying, she's crying and the forest... in my dreams.
Now when the time has come and ancient trees keep silence
in the eternal autumn of loneliness, in bloody skies I've ever dead
She's dying, she's dying and my memories... in my dreams
