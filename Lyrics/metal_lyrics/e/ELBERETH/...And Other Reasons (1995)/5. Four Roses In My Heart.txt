Deep inside the bloody war, I just feel the shots of guns
and I dream of being a bird to fly far away from my home
four roses in my heart their thorns defend my feeble hope
four roses in my heart, like oceans growing in the sand
I don't believe in gods nor in future lives, I've learn to be strong
I wake up, hearing a painful song, and one voice
in every drop of rain that longs for a white dove.
Long time ago I understood my own existence
Nobody will save me, so I just own my inner endurance
