Another murder, so many murders...
Grey rain falls on bloody chests, a child suffers,
he'll not hear again - "I love you son".
How to explain that?
It's impossible to erase the moment
that will mark a life, the color of emptiness.
The waves break against the weakest
and the meerschaum takes away the pieces.
It rains on bloody backs, a mother pains,
her son tortured, she loves her son.
Why come to that?
Both heads of the coins are only one, it's affliction.
Breathening the salty scent of the breeze,
I'd like the meerschaum to bring the pieces,
the waves break against the weakest,
and the meerschaum takes away pieces.
