[Music by E.O.F. - Lyrics by Sebastian Stumpe (c) 2002 by E.O.F.]

The dark heart!
Watch it explode!
My dark heart!

IÂ´m sitting here in my black room, and watch the sky turn dark!
Cutting myself and taste the blood, while morbid fantasies fill my heart!
Strange illusions in my mind, the ugly thought of eating flesh!
Breaking the bones of my enemies, is one of my sweetest melodies!

The dark heart!

I wanna hit your goddamn face, and smash your brain as hard as I can!
I feel my dark heart explode, I am not longer your scapegoat!
IÂ´m getting nervous my hands ware wet, I run through the dark smelling your sweat!
I wanna get psychic for a while, with your heart in my hand I sit again here and smile!

The dark heart!
ItÂ´s my dark heart!
Feel, my, feel, my dark heart!
My dark heart!
ThereÂ´s no escape!
Dark heart!!!
ThereÂ´s no escape!!!
