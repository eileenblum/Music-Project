[Music by E.O.F. - Lyrics by Sebastian Stumpe (c) 2004 by E.O.F.]

1, 2, 3, 4, here we go!!!

When blood change to acid, when love turns to hate,
I feel that IÂ´m hated!!!

I feel IÂ´m hated!!!

Within my spirit, I notice a change, what I used to know about life,
Seems so strange, I am feeling so tired, and I hate what you desire,
What you love!!!

When blood change to acid, when love turns to hate,
I feel that IÂ´m hated, I feel that IÂ´m despised!
When I think I tell the truth, I know that I lie,
All that I deserve, is a reason to die!

Within my spirit, I notice a change, what I used to know about life!!!

When blood change to acid, when love turns to hate,
I feel that IÂ´m hated, I feel that IÂ´m despised!
When I think I tell the truth, I know that I lie,
All that I deserve, is a reason to die!

Because everytime I feel my hate motherfucker!
Everytime I feel my hate motherfucker!
Everytime I feel my hate motherfucker!
Everytime I feel my hate motherfucker!

Blood, Acid, Love, Hate!!!
