[Music by E.O.F. - Lyrics by Sebastian Stumpe (c) 2004 by E.O.F.]

We were faced with our fate, but recognized a bit too late,
That it is not our fault, to deal with that cruel assault.
We are here, to go for it, passing all this old bullshit.
So be prepared for our war, you have to see, thatÂ´s what we are!

Coming from the darkest place, smashing it right in you face,
Taking lead of all your actions, this is the,
Frailbreed resurrection!!!

We are back, to strike again, putting us right in your vein,
We are here, to quench your thirst, you are not next, no you are first.
You get us immediately, open your eyes and you will see
That we are the sick man- eaters, cutting you, through tasty pieces!

Coming from the darkest place, smashing it right in you face,
Taking lead of all your actions, this is the,
Frailbreed resurrection!!!

You canÂ´t defeat us, canÂ´t destroy our legacy!
You canÂ´t denie, weÂ´re in your heart,
We fulfil the prophecy!

GO!!!

Coming from the darkest place, smashing it right in you face,
Taking lead of all your actions, this is the,
Frailbreed resurrection!!!
