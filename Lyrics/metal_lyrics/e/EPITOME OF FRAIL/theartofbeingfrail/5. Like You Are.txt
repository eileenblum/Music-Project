[Music by E.O.F. - Lyrics by Sebastian Stumpe (c) 2004 by E.O.F.]

DonÂ´t denie, what you are! Your own spirit, is drifting away so far!
DonÂ´t denie, your own way! Because this game, is dangerous to play!

Like You Are!

I see how you act, I hear what you say,
I know what you think, but thatÂ´s not your way!
I know thatÂ´s not you! The person I like!
I look at your face, and I want to strike!

STRIKE!!!

Everywhere we are, I see what you do!
I see like you are and I know thatÂ´s not you!
You do things youÂ´ve never done before!
You make the clown, and hope to score!

Like You Are! No!

And itÂ´s the fucking like you are!

ItÂ´s awful to see, how you change,
What do you want, you are so strange!
You are talking, all the time,
And face the world, with thousands of lies.

LIES!!!
