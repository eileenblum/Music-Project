[Music by E.O.F. - Lyrics by Sebastian Stumpe (c) 2002 by E.O.F.]

RESPECT!!!

RESPECT!!! [2x]

Show some RESPECT!!!

A bit of RESPECT!!!

I tell you a little story, about ways of life!
About living together, like a man and his wife!
(like a man and his wife!)
Living in society, has a nice effect!
If you live together, by keeping RESPECT!!!

WhatÂ´s repect and whatÂ´s not? have you ever thought about?
ItÂ´s important and correct, to treat people with RESPECT!!!

There are people you hate, and you want them to know!
One way is to say, the other is to show!
(the other is to show!)
It doesnÂ´t matter which way, if you stay correct!
Tell them what you want, if you tell it with RESPECT!!!

WhatÂ´s repect and whatÂ´s not? have you ever thought about?
ItÂ´s important and correct, to treat people with RESPECT!!!

RESPECT!!!

I tell you, a little story, about ways of life,
And thatÂ´s what I call some kind of: RESPECT!!!

RESPECT!!!
