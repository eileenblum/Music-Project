[Music by EOF / Lyrics written by Sebastian Stumpe Â© 2005 by E.O.F.]

Time for revenge, no more second chances!
Sick of wasting my time, with what youÂ´ve done to me!
Pure Hatred I will give to you, itÂ´s the end of the line!
Never again will you lie to my face, now is the time!
I will descend to rise like a holy plague,
IÂ´ll drive you to despair and make your nightmares come true!
You will wish, you would never been born!
My wrath is unstoppable! Kneel down and pray!

Time and time again you lie to my face! Betrayed, deceived and lost!
But now itÂ´s time for you to kneel down and pray, on our judgement day!

Now stop to beg! There is no reason for compromise!

ItÂ´s too late, the time has come to arise!
Out of the ashes, IÂ´ll start a crusade!
A war for myself, to punish your actions!
My foot on your head, IÂ´ll bruise your throat!
My foot in your face, how does it feel?
I will never forget!!!
You made me what I am!!!

Time and Time again you lie to my face! You made me feel like waste!
But now itÂ´s time for you to kneel down and pray, on our judgement day!

YOU CAN NOTâ¦BREAK ME!!!
I AM HEREâ¦JUDGEMENT DAY!!!

[Dedicated to every Traitor, Coward and especially to T."K".W. Our Judgement Day is near my friend!!!]
