Frightening voices calling out my name
Something's pushing and grabbing after me
Around tight corners in between
I'm lying
As I try to scream

So I grow up
With a view, no-one had before

I see society
I see the misery

And so I wake up
with hate in my core

I see society
And I see memories
of the death

I am a child
with the age of twelve
start consuming nicotine for my own health
I am a teenie, I am sixteen
start taking drugs now
Cause I can't find another way to escape
The mist of idiocy
makes them all blind
The dust in their souls is eating through their minds
I'm getting older
and all I see
are Mindless zombies
taking pills on the streets
Out of hatred
I'd like to quit
Cuz look at our society, It's a piece of shit

There's no worth
for the truth
because no-one cares

There's no hope
for all
just look at yourselves!

[x3]
Lieing
Hating
Hurting
Pushing
Fucking
Haunting
Waiting
Praying

No voice, no choice, but giving up
but please - stop haunting, let me out
Bastards!
What are they doing to me?
And I realize, as I start to breathe
to breathe
