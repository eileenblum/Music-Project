This is us
and this is not society
We will not!
We will never beaten down!

This is real
And this is not humanity
This is not humanity
This is not humanity!

Run!

Get down!
Get on your knees
Pray to god
he'll not take your breathe

Go on praying!
until they'll eat your brains
Go on crying!
until your last tear kills
Go on praying!
until they'll eat your brains

[x2]
Stay here
And pray to god
You think, he's hearing you?
You think, he's hearing you?

Oh

[x4]
You think, he's hearing you?

He's not!

This is us
and this is not society
We will not!
We will never beaten down!

This is real
and this is not humanity.
This is not humanity
This is not humanity!
