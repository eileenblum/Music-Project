After years with everything we've always wished to have
After all my trust in you there's nothing left to give
After everything I've done for you, this your kind of thanks?
Don't look at me, don't talk to me, don't touch me ever again!

We've been together in these cold nights
We've seen each other in eternity

I gave you everything, my honour and my life
But instead of thanks, you stabbed me right from behind

We've been together in your bitter cries
We've seen that there is nothing left behind

What, what, what?

What have I done to you this bad? Answer my questions, bitch!
But destiny will revenge soon

I fighted so many times, I can't get it in my head
Pranked me, left me and explained,

And explained

that love's long dead, BITCH.

And this thing explained

That Love's, that Love's
that Love's Long Dead!

Demises,
painful like death.
But
there's something behind all

I am glad to be disposed of you

cause life's got more, BITCH.

What have I done to you? Answer my questions, bitch!
But destiny revenge, I'll laugh about all this.

I gave you everything, my honour and my life
But instead of thanks, you stabbed me right from behind

After everything, I've done for you!
Go kill yourself or someone else will do
