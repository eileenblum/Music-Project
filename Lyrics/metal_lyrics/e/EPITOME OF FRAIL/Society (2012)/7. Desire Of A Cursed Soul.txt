So you left me inside,
behind your own fears!
All you have left
is just an empty shell,
broken memorie of days that were so long
Inside thereÂ´s nothing left
except tears and devastation!

Within this revelation lies a fountain!
ItÂ´s spreading life and death
without being cold or warm!
ItÂ´s neverending! ItÂ´s ridiculous! ItÂ´s a vision!
of times and memories of joy!
Asking why
is completely senseless!
because there never was an âIâ in I LOVE YOU !
And now youÂ´re dead to me!
YouÂ´re dead and gone!
We will
never meet again!

And After all,
all you did, was leaving me!
Leaving me hurt
and left behind!
Alone in the dark,
wounded like a deer!
Bleeding from within
with no end in sight!
But I was on my own,
even before we met!
So I am
on my own again!

Alone,
but not weak or helpless!
I will go on and thereÂ´s nothing that will stop me!

This is the desire of a cursed soul!
This is the demand for a better life without you!
This is the desire of a cursed soul!
This is a demand from within! from within!

I will never stop or make a step back!
I am here, no retreat and no surrender!!!

This is the desire of a cursed soul
no retreat and no surrender
