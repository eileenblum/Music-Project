I am with you
I know, who you are
I am the source of hope

I am your fucking god!
You're not the source of hope

You're not my fucking god

You can't force me
Because you can't deny

Father!
Father!
Father!
let me live
Father!
Father!
Father!
You can't bring me down, again!

You can't force me
Because you can't deny
Humanity
Believes a fucking lie!

You are with me
But I don't know who you are
you're not the source of hope
You're not my fucking god

I am the master
You just eat people's brains
I spread happiness
Until people cut their veins

You can't force me
to live your stupid rules
civil unrest
shows that we are the used

Father!
Father!
Father!
let me live
Father!
Father!
Father!
you can't bring me down again

Father!
Father!
Father!
go and die
Father!
Father!
Father!
I believed a LIE!
