You all have thousand second chances
And you're too damn to use
All your hope and prayers
didn't reach god

Humans make faults,
yes! but not these ones
I am so tired of
comparing them with monsters

And this is all because
God doesn't hear you
This is all because
God hates you

You may visit church
You may wait and pray
But I tell you though
he won't answer

You may also amog
You may also rape people
You may also lie to live higher
He doesn't matter

And this is all because
God doesn't hear you
This is all because
God hates you
