I will survive until the last enemy is dead
Too many lost fights, my dreams are buried in my head
I don't have another chance but standing here
And to fight these people who once were my dears
Because in times where's nothing left but hatred
I can't live without, burned your fucking faces

So I start attacking right though this distortion
And this time, my friends, I'll shit on your emotions!

Because this is my revenge
These are my wounds you've taken
You will die alone, die alone forsaken.

[x4]
This is my revenge

This has been my life, you live now
And this will be also your burial

[x4]
also your burial

I just can't get it in my mind what happened, thought I wouldn't survive this matter
But now I'm standing here, I'm wounded but I'm still alive
And I start laughing as you look at me and say, I'm right
I just can't get it in my head, how dumb you are

Look at your abortive lifes, you fucking mindless idiots!
This is the end of this senseless massakker
I'll never be again part of your disaster
This is the end of this senseless massakker

Oh
Because this is my revenge
These are my wounds you've taken
You will die alone, forsaken
Because this is my revenge
this is my revenge
This has been my life, you live now
And this will be also your burial
And this will be also your burial

No! You can't get me down again
You don't understand anything.
You're suffering in your deepest core
in the end I'm the winner of this bloody war
