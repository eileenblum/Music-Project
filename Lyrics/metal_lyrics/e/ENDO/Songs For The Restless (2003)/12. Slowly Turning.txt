So you say the sun
Always fades for you
I can pray for love
Then betray what's true
So you say that you know
You know where I'm going
So afraid that you're lost
In a world unknowing 

We're slowly turning
Into nothing
We're slowly turning
We're so cold
So cold
We're so cold 

I will take this time
To exist into
Integrate my mind
And have faith for you
So you say that you know
You know where I'm going
So afraid that you're lost
In a world that's turning 

We're slowly turning
Into nothing
We're slowly turning
We're so cold
So cold
We're so cold 

In my head
It's in my head 

We're slowly turning
Into nothing
We're slowly turning
We're so cold
So cold
We're so cold
