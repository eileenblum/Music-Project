Take me low
Feed me slow
Leave me empty
Nothing's right when they've all found you guilty
Shame that you can't see
That all the things that pass through me
Makes me say 

Rape me slowly 
Take my skin
Leave me under
Bleeding within
You stabbed in the back
Look what you left 
All naked by myself 

It's ok when you're wrong
And then let me
I'm not sure
I know
Tell me
Shame that you can't see
That all the things that pass through me
Makes me say 

Rape me slowly 
Take my skin
Leave me under
Bleeding within
You stabbed in the back
Look what you left 
All naked by myself 

It's a shame
Shame on you
It's a shame
