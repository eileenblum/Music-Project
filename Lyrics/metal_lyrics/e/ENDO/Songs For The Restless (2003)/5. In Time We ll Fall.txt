Inside an empty hole where we're both suffocating
Talking to myself and find that I'm not listening
Screaming
Crying
There's someone in my body 
Screaming 

I see it all
In time we'll fall
I hear it all
In time we'll fall
I feel it all 
In in time we'll fall 

I'm falling over
I'm falling over you
I'm falling over 

Inside an empty hole where we're both suffocating
Talking to myself and find that I'm not listening
Screaming
Crying 

I see it all
In time we'll fall
I hear it all
In time we'll fall
I feel it all 
In in time we'll fall 

In time we'll fall
We're suffocating 

I see it all
In time we'll fall
I hear it all
In time we'll fall
I feel it all 
In in time we'll fall
I see it all
In time we'll fall
