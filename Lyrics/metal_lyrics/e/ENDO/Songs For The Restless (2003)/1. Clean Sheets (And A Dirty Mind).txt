In illusion
You're suspicious
This insomnia turned religious
In my silence
I'm just paranoid
I've been waiting so long to hear your voice
Faces of our innocence
Surface in my memory
The dream I thought once to be dead
Has rendered back inside of me 

Take my sorrow
Take my patience
In your eyes I surrender contagious
With clean sheets and a dirty mind
We both need somewhere to pass the time 

Faces of our innocence
Surface in my memory
The dream I thought once to be dead
Is rendered deep inside of me 

Take my sorrow
Take my patience
In your eyes I surrender contagious
With clean sheets and a dirty mind
We both need somewhere to pass the time 

All these faces
Longing for some piece of mind
In the end of innocence
All these faces of our innocence is gone 

Take my sorrow
Take my patience
In your eyes I surrender contagious
With clean sheets and a dirty mind
We both need somewhere to pass the time
