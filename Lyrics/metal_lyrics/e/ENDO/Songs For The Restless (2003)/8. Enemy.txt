Will they make it out without us
To the end of the sea
Will they forget about us
Once they get on their feet
Will we ever make it out
Will we ever see the sun
We need to free what's killing us 

I see you breathe
I feel you here by me
Your soul it pulls
I feel you here by me 

There's a side of me that's so good to you
A side of my that's so cruel to you
A side of me that's so ###### to choose
A side of me that lies to me 

I see you breathe
I feel you here by me
Your soul it pulls
I feel you here by me 

You're the enemy
