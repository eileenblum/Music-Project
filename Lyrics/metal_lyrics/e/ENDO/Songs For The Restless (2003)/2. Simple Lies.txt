Lust in pictures
Demeaning in purpose
Tired so tired
Yet trying to inspire
A lack of faith
A great imagination
A perfect perception
Of guilt-ridden photographs of you
Of you 

Besides, besides 

Simple lies
Are what we are
And what we have
Won't hurt anymore


Silently waiting
For a moment with you
As I tie you into nothing
Understand my hate for you
What is wrong or what is right
I push you through
I can't live
With or without you 

Besides, besides 

Simple lies
Are what we are
And what we have
Won't hurt anymore 

Insomnia keeps us alive
We will rest in death
I will make you pay in other ways
I will try to put my self back
Together again 

Besides, besides 

Simple lies
Are what we are
And what we have
Won't hurt anymore
