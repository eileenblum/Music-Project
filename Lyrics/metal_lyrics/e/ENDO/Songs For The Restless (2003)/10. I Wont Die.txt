These uncontrollable thoughts
They stem from you
These undeniable shocks
They stem from you
This undeniable sleeplessness
It stems from you
This undeniable weakness
It stems from you 

We're just falling off the deep end 

Dying 
Screaming
In this hole that you fill
Die, die, die, I won't die for
Screaming
Slowly
Die, die, die, I won't die for you 

These wandering eyes
Watch after you
These paranoid lies
Run after you
This undeniable sleeplessness
It stems from you
This undeniable weakness
It stems from you 

We're just falling off the deep end 

Dying 
Screaming
In this hole that you fill
Die, die, die, I won't die for
Screaming
Slowly
Die, die, die, I won't die for you 

Every day
Every ####### minute
I think 
I've lost my self in you
Betrayed myself for you 

You mark me the deepest
You scar me the deepest
You hurt me the deepest
You mark me the deepest 

We're just falling off the deep end 

Dying 
Screaming
In this hole that you fill
Die, die, die, I won't die for
Screaming
Slowly
Die, die, die, I won't die for you
