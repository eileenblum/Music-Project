Alone with my thoughts
Memories I'm with you
Are moments with God
Days that were so true
Now fall into pain
Reason escapes me
I'm only to blame
I can't see without you
Without you 

Remember us
Remember us
Always forever us
Forever us
Do you remember us
Remember us 

Seeing you now
Alone and without me
I've suffered somehow
I can't see through me
I'm only in pain
So lost without you
Alone and in shame
I can't see through you
Without you 

Remember us
Remember us
Always forever us
Forever us
Do you remember us
Remember us 

A mirror in your eyes
Remembering our lives
A mirror in your eyes
I remember 

Remember us
Remember us
Always forever us
Forever us
Do you remember us
Remember us
