Another circle
We will make
Another circle
We take
It's all a question
To save the truth
Another lesson we lose
Ever since you went away
I dream about you every day
And hope that peace will be
The flame for you
As we grow 

We will make it out of this
Step by step we'll take them before us
We will make it out of this
We will overcome
Love will save us 

It's all a circle
We will make
Another circle
We take
It's all a question
To save the truth
Another lesson we choose 

We will make it out of this
We will overcome
