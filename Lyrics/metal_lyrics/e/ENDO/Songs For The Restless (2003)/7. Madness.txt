Madness
Madness
What if it's genius
Genius
But the people that are mad aren't structured to know
Meaning humans
Humans 

Show me a place to another world
Show me a soul I could never know
Show me a place to another world 

Circling inside my head
Wishing everyday I'm dead
Taking everything from me
Making out I could not see
Seduce me 
Take my soul you're in control
Reduce me
Take my soul you're in control 

Show me a place to another world
Show me a soul I could never know
Show me a place to another world 

Madness
Madness
What if it's genius
Genius
But the people that are mad aren't structured to know
Meaning humans
Humans 

Show me a place to another world
Show me a soul I could never know
Show me a place to another world
