Sell, sell, everything's for sale.
Hey there kid, you're looking kinda pale.
Victim of society's hell,
Sell your soul for the dollar bill.
Reach up the sky, make me high
Walk on water, rise and shine.
Listen, won't you listen?
I wanna taste you deep inside!

I'm so tired of being sick.
I need a drink, I need a fix.
I can't complain, just close the door,
Cuz I'll never be your little whore!

[chorus]
One day you'll get yours.
Someday you'll get yours. 
[repeat chorus]

Listen, won't you listen? [4x]

[chorus]
