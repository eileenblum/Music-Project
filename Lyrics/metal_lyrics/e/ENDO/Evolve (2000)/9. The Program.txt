You better get with the program in your fuckin' head,
Cuz the life you see is left for dead.
With the program in your fuckin' head,
Yeah the life you see is left for dead.

[chorus]
You're indecisive, gone too far.
Stuck in denial which leaves you scarred.

Some say life is dead, shot back in my head.
Some say your life is dead, shot back in my...

[chorus]
Scarred, scarred, scarred motherfucker.

Once again with the program, in your fuckin' head
Cuz the life you see is left for dead.
With the program in your fuckin' head,
Yeah the life you see is left for dead.

Once again, the front is ability...
I can't realize what's inside of me yeah,
I feel the break, uh-huh it's comin' through the drop zone,
My life in the far zone, yeah
I can't wait, no, inside I feel the heat
The kid's on, I keep my seeds in me.
I can't wait to be the one,
It's cramping my vibe, grabbin' the wrench.
Once again, the front is ability...
I can't realize what's inside of me yeah,
I feel the break, uh-huh it's comin' through the drop zone,
My life in the far zone, yeah
I can't wait, no, inside I feel the heat
The kid's on, I keep my seeds in me.
I can't wait to be the one,
It's cramping my vibe, grabbin' the WRENCH!!!!!!!!!

You better get with the program in your fuckin' head,
Cuz the life you see is left for dead.
With the program in your fuckin' head,
Yeah the life you see is left for dead.

[chorus]
