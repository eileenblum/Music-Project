First things first, let the mindset flow [4x]

[chorus]
Leave us alone, it's not what you think! [4x]

Animals, let down like the cannibals...
Leave us alone, it's not what you think.
The fire, big guns are for hire.
Fuck what you say, we do what we feel.
Pickin' it up off the downlow, makin' sure systems go.
Breakin' it off with the Endo... ALONE!

[chorus]

I drop the bomb, and the bomb set go (go!) [4x]

[chorus]
LEAVE US ALONE!
