She loves to die with me, she loves to feel empty.
When we speak, words take us in beneath our makeup!

Will we ever learn? I just let it burn... just let it burn.

Inside me, I've fallen. This world still keeps killing.
Don't feed my your violence, just leave me in silence.

Will we ever learn? OH YEAH, I just let it burn... let it burn.

Will we ever learn? I just let it burn. Will we ever learn? Let it burn.
JUST LET IT BURN! LET IT BURN! LET IT BURN! LET IT BURN! LET IT...
OH YEAH, will we ever learn? Oh no, I just let it BUUUURRRRRRN! JUST LET IT BURN!
