Get the fuck away!

My decision is made, I got no time to fake this.
I'm leavin' the world behind me, no time to take this.
My decision is made, I got no time to fake this.
I'm leavin' the world behind me, no time to take this.
NO!

[chorus]
You don't believe it, you don't see it.
Always bleeding, you're goin' down, yeah!
You got, you got, you got to get away...
When times are rough, we need to break away!
You got, you got, you got to get away...
When times are rough, we need to break away!

As I search for the answers deep in my mind,
As I break into something, something new, something real
In your face, make you taste as i come.
From this world of strife, feel the pain of life yet I still breathe...
You got no choice but to feed motherfuckin' GREED!

[chorus]

GET THE FUCK AWAY!
NO!

[chorus]

TO GET AWAY! GET AWAY! TO GET AWAY! Oh, get the fuck away.
