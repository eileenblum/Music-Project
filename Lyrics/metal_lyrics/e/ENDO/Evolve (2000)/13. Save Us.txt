One nation full of fear,
Temptation way too strong.
You scream without a tear,
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!

[chorus]
In here, save us!
We're here, save us!

I ask before the free why freedom kills the brave.
A false reality leaves me enslaved! Go.

[chorus]

Want to believe, you wanna try... freedom's within, don't let yourself die. [2x]
There's something wrong, something's wrong.
There's something wrong, there's something wrong!

[chorus]

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!
SAVE US! SAVE US! SAVE US! SAVE US!
