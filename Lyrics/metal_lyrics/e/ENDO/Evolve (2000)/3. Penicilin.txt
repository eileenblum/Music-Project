Young and scared, thoughts impaired.
False emotions, impure accusations...
is it coming near, the end I fear?
The world, an infection with no penicillin.

[chorus]
Stop bleeding on me... STOP BLEEDING ON ME!
Watch out, reinstate, take our your inner hate! [2x]

Your silhouette trapped in my head, 
Like that unforgotten song from the dead.
Taste my desperate soul fiending for more
Like a junkie out of control.
Feed this desperate soul fucked up and back on the floor,
Feed this desperate soul; you've got me screaming for more.

[chorus]

STOP! STOP! STOP!
BLEEDING ON ME! [4x]
