[chorus]
Don't beat around the bush!

Bringin' me closer to here, takin' me farther than near.
Insecure love fit commands shovin' my face in the sand, go!

Stick it in 'em, I'll stick it in 'emI'll make 'em feel.
Lettin' 'em know that this life is for real.
Stick it in 'em, I'll stick it in 'em to make 'em see
The choices that drive our disease... yeah.

[chorus]

Bringin' me closer to here, takin' me farther than near.
Insecure love fit commands shovin' my face in the sand, go!

Can't you see that you're fuckin' up the program?
You've got the score, maybe you've got the hand, uh!
Lost your breath, now you're lying on your back...
Lost your head caught smokin' crack.

It's all you wanted, it's all you needed. Don't... don't...
Don't beat... don't beat... don't beat... DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH!

[chorus] [4x]

Beat around it, don't beat around the bush! [4x]

SAY IT, MOTHERFUCKER!
