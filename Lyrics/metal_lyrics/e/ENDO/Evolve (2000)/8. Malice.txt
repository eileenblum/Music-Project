I can't breathe cuz I don't wanna breathe no more.
I can't see cuz I don't wanna see at all.
I can't feel cuz I don't wanna feel no more.
I can't deal cuz I don't wanna deal at all!

In a state.

I can't breathe cuz I don't wanna breathe no more.
I can't see cuz I don't wanna see at all.
I can't feel cuz I don't wanna feel no more.
I can't deal cuz I don't wanna deal at all!

I'm paranoid, socially paranoid.
I'm waiting on an asteroid to come along and make us well.
I'm paranoid, mentally in a void.
I'm waiting on an asteroid to come along and make us well!

[chorus x2]
FUCK YOUR PERFECTION! YOUR PERFECTION!
You want that personal attention, your perfection...

In a state of malice, in a state of shame...
I wouldn't be so careless if I had you to blame.
Now I lay me down to rest, now I lay me down.
Now I lay me down to death, NOW I LAY ME!

[chorus x2]

Now I lay me down to rest, (I can't breathe cuz I don't wanna breathe no more)
Now I lay me down. (I can't see cuz I don't wanna see at all.)
Now I lay me down to rest, now I lay me down.
Now I lay me down to death, NOW I LAY ME!

[chorus x2]
