Let it go.

What's drowning you is slowly drowning me,
You make me suffer to watch your disease.
Trapped in yourself, come release your mind.
Relax, we'll leave this world behind!

[chorus]
You still suffer, still suffering.
You still suffer from this state you're in.
You still suffer, still suffering.
You still suffer from this shit you're in.

Let it go.

Shade in your world and lost within your sea,
Fade in the shadows, in trust you deceive.
You hold your breath underneath your lies...
Confined, you leave the knife inside!

[chorus]

Down low, on the phone, so afraid to be alone.
Shot down underneath, bring me down for what I need.
I cried for you, maybe God could see me through...
I pray every day, YOU'RE STILL IN MY SKIN!

[chorus]

WHY?! [4x]
