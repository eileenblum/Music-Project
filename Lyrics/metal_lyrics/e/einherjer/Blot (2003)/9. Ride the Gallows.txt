Galders great, nine BÃ²ltorn gave
Nine lays of might
Drank the draught of Kvasirâs blood
Mead Divine

Word from word gave words to me
And throve full well
Deed from deed gave deeds to me
Ere long prudence came

Runes youâll find and fateful signs
Strong staves, stout staves
Runes that Galdra-Father stained
Runes of old graved

Word from word gave words to me
How to evoke them
Deed from deed gave deeds to me
How to score them

Ride the gallows of the norns
Born secrets of the dead
Nine runes
Nine lays
Born secrets of the norns

Ride the gallows of the norns
Born secrets of the dead
Nine runes
Nine lays
Born secrets of the dead
