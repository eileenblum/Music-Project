âFear rule my world still
Has ruled it, shall rule it
Meek is weakâ
Ill-boding wolfs blood
Crowned in woe, death-stained
Dread-gard Queen

Sear the runes of wrath
The rependant writhes in remorse
Niflhel - Ware her venom

To be taught by tongue of treason
Hoping nothing knowing nothing
Ware her venom

Serenely cold-blooded
Death embedded skin
Wrapped around death-sin
Words of unwise men
Pierce all senses
Pain, yes pounding pain

Hear the screams of deceit
The Half-dead sneers in delight
Niflhel - Ware her venom

To be taught by tongue of treason
Hoping nothing knowing nothing
Ware her venom
