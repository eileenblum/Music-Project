[Lyrics and music: Gerhard Storesund]

As blood for wolves and riches for lust
Onwards with hammers to chest
Villages burn, burn cities to dust
And for fun they torture the rest

Cold blue steel through a nice lady's breast
An avalanche of heathens set sail
To show to the world which men is best
To conquer where others would fail

Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North

Odin is working to eagerly form
A great heathen fist from north
Pray for your life when there's signs of a storm
But praying won't help when the dragons come forth

Roaming the bow, the berserkers, the fierce
They know not fear or pain
Women and children are swimming in tears
While the berserkers are going insane

Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North

Scholared embodied by blood on the mound
The clink of sword sound death chord
Bear slough and wolf slough are shaking the ground
Embraced by might the great northern horde

Odin, great warlord I greet you with hail
This new god is weaker of class
Grant me thy powers, your secrets unveil
And I'll kick this Christ right in the ass

Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
