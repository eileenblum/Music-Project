[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes, music by Gerhard Storesund]

For ages I have drifted, through storms and mists of grey
With knowledge I've been gifted, and paths to lead my way
Alone in realms of chaos, my solitude I seek
I poison therefore my arrow, and aim it at the weak

Come my winds â my dream storm
Soon I shall forever sleep
Pale I have become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done

Silently I welcome, the glorious mist of dreams
Time to send the heroes home, their end justify my means
Dawn of death, tears of chaos, echoes in my mind
It pleases me, I am satisfied

Closing in on death's desire, though I am not alone
With me comes my fear and fire, and a destiny unknown
My twilight affects me, drifting still in dreams
A gate opens in front of me, weary visions floats in streams

Come my winds â my dream storm
Soon I shall forever sleep
Pale I have become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done
