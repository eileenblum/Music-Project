[Lyrics by Rune Bjelland, music by Gerhard Storesund]

Awaken thou, one-eyed god,
Rise again from thine slumber!
Give us a touch of the elder strength
Flowing in your veins
And give us again the courage to crush
The embers of the faded ones

A lightning ripped the sky
The signs of ancient beliefs enlighten
The inner chambers
Of forbidden knowledge
Oh, rise the storm of the elder

Let again Gungnir fly
Into the chests of Giants,
And release again the power
Of your eight-legged horse
Ride again in front of the Oskorei
And lead fear into hearts of men
Enlighten the path for those of the elder spirit
And guide them into glory

We entered a long gone and forgotten valley
Its habitants' flames of life long gone
Ceased by a dark and ancient plague
In the heart of this forbidden place,
We awakened the spirit of the past,
And we entered the dawn
Of the slumbering one

Odin opened his eye
And looked out into the world
He lifted his arms to the sky
And called for the other gods
And commanded them to awaken
From their ages of slumber
Again they rose from the ground,
For these where still embers
Of the lost faith of them
In the halls of Valhalla
