[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes, music by Audun Wold, Gerhard Storesund and Frode Glesnes]

Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
And scalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords blood-red were swung
"One-eyed father
Give us the strength
My brave kinsmen and I
In Valhalla I
Your mighty men will meet
If in this battle I die
From the sky
Your ravens watching me
Both of them I see
Thank you father
For letting me know
You watch over me."
At the moor
The ravens spoke to me
While scalds did their song
A bitter loss
Was soon to come
For those I were among

Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
And scalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords blood-red were swung
I say to you I ask you to
For once be your own lord
Come with me
Be part of my
Ballad of the swords

A sudden clash
Where swords were drawn
Was the beginning of my end
With a Norseman's pride
And courage I fought
I would to Hel them send
Instead I felt
Cold chilling steel
Stab me from behind
A cravens deed
Indeed it was
Peace he should not find
Faded I did
Strange beauty I met
The dream for me came true
Brought up I were
Bifrost I saw
My mortal life were through
Your mortal life
With children and wife
Wouldn't have no value
If you knew as I
About life up here
You would die to be here forever
