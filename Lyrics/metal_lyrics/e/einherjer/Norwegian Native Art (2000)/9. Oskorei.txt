[bonus track]

Can you hear it?
Can you feel it?
The souls of the dead
Waft away on the winds of a storm.

Rushing through mid-air
The Hounds of the Hunt
It's the procession of the dead
The stabbed, the hanged and the drowned.

The roar of hooves and horns
Pound the skies
Dark omens of doom
Hear their cries
Shivers down your spine
Oskorei
Oskorei

Come join us...
Come ride with us
The dreadful ride
On the track of men
Throughout the world

And will not give up
All faithless should fear
The ride of the dead
Their hunting horns and the raging host

The roar of hooves and horns
Pound the skies
Dark omens of doom
Hear their cries
Shivers down your spine
Oskorei
Oskorei
