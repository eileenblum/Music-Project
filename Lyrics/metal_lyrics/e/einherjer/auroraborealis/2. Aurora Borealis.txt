[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storsund &amp; Frode Glesnes]

A freezing winter sweeps the land
A creeping frost sets in
The fog encircles the castle
Surrounded by a total silence
Black clouds weigh upon from above
The candles are the only lights
The trance is getting deeper
Reaching upon thy mighty thrones
Then an iceblue shimmer hits the wall
The wind whistles a melancholy tune
Feel their presence
Oskorei

During dark and stormy nights of winter
You may see the lights of Thule
Aurora Borealis

Crossing the wastes of the northern fields
Frozen by the cold that paralizes the will
Enter the darkest depths of the northern woods
Tormented by the heat of the hellburning flames
Black moon rising from the sea way up north
Wotan rides across the sky
His fallen warriors hails him high
A freezing winter
A creeping frost
Black moon rising
Thy mighty thrones
