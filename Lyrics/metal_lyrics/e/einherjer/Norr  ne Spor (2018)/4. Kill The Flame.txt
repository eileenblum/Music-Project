A change of shadows
In the forest old
Into the cold
A darkness descends
And tightens the grip
It kills the light
Yeah, kills the light

A cry above the suffering
A cry above the earth
You reap what you sow
Yeah, what you sow

Kill, kill the flame
For I am the bleeding man
Reap, reap the earth
You will now kill the flame

A change of pace
For the greed of man
Above the salt
A call for blood
A call for death
Above the waves
Above it all

Kill, kill the flame
For I am the bleeding man
Reap, reap the earth
You will now kill the flame

Come be heard
All the silent screams
Come and see
All the vivid dreams

[Lead: SÃ¸nstabÃ¸]

Kill, kill the flame
For I am the bleeding man
Reap, reap the earth
You will now kill the flame
