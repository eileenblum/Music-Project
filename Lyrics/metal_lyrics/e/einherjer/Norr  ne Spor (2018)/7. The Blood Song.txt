Walk the world
A wounded man
On shores of time
A stricken man
There's blood in the sand
From earth to man

Against the wind
I close my eyes
The wings of the raven
The heart of man
There's blood in the sand
Echoes throughout the land

From the first to the last
Cast the runes of the past
And higher and higher
Burns the fire

See the sun
So warm and strong
Through the skies
The darkness done
There's blood in the sand
The end of the line

Keep on bleeding
More and more
From the ashes
To the fire
There's blood in the sand
From earth to man

From the first to the last
Cast the runes of the past
And higher and higher
Burns the fire

[Lead: SÃ¸nstabÃ¸]

From the first to the last
Cast the runes of the past
And higher and higher
Burns the fire

High noon
There's no sun
Can you see his face?
Where is your star?
There's bloodâ¦
On the runes
