The winds
And their chanting song
You should listen
To a force so strong
The fire
The burning passion
Can you feel it?
A true lack of compassion

The waves
The deep connection
Find the balance
Close to perfection
Ground yourself
And keep moving
See the stars
The tears of the sun

Right!
Over the edge
Listen!
To the silent pledge
Look!
At the funeral pyre
Right!
Ignite the fire

The spirit of a thousand years
Speak the words
The spear cries out for blood
Gather the herds
The spirit of a thousand years
Hear the call
Man is pushing the edge
The narrow-minded man

[Lead: SÃ¸nstabÃ¸]

Right!
Over the edge
Listen!
To the silent pledge
Look!
At the funeral pyre
Right!
Ignite the fire
