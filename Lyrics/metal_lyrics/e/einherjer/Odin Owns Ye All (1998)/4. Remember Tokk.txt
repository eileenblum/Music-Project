I am the one of battles reason
I left this world my mothers corpse
I am the eyes and heart of treason
My lullabye the screams of horse
I am the haunting and the hurting
I read the walls of memory
I am the fist in the face of glory
I grow and my fire with me

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules

I am the incarnation of all ages
I've seen it all &amp; of reason
Some of you may trust in me
And some of you may know that;
Stones &amp; earth swore an oath
As did iron and all kinds of ore
Some cried tears but Tokk did not
She did what she could why ask for more

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules

My children might be known to you
Some might even met them too
Guilt is mine in words not felt
Wisdoms sons presence lack
Mother father which am I
Ask my sons wolf or death
I will guarantee
This is not the last you've heard from me

I've felt the taste of poison
Water wet I breathe like air
I caused the earth to rumble
And soon the end of all you know
Some of you may recognize
My skills in lies and betrayal acts
The very same might find it strange
My brother is the wisdoms face

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules
