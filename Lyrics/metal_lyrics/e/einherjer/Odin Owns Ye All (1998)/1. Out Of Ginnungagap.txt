When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be

Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came Yggdrasil
Came life
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came all of what is today

The sun turned from the south
Sister of Moon
She did not have
Nor Had the Moon
A notion of what
Powers they had
A counsil were gathered
Where names were given
The night and the nightfall
And the morning they named
The mid-day, mid-winter
For the assigning of years

Bur had three sons Vile, Ve and Odin
They killed the giant Ymir and founded what we know
They gave us life, spirit and wisdom
Odin owns us all and we owe all to him

When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be

Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came Yggdrasil
Came life
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came all of what is today
