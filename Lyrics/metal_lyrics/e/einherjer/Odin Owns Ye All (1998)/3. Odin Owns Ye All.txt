I sit by the fires gleam all by myself
Four empty chairs &amp; one've been kept warm
I drink to my kinsmen who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin who'll drink here no more

Odin owns ye all

I sing to them songs I wish their best on their way
I'm sure a valkyrie found them in the battle that day
I drink to my kinsmen who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin who'll be missed not just by me

Odin owns ye all

To arms To arms - The kinsmen said
They've chosen to meet us in battle today
Fight Fight - The kinsmen said
If we show true norse courage they'll soon run away
Wrong Wrong - The kinsmen thought
You cowards are fourty men may you rot in Hel
Rise Rise - The valkyries said
Odin decided this day you would die

I drink to my kinsmen
Who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin
Who'll drink here no more
I drink to my kinsmen
Who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin
Who'll be missed not just by me

Odin owns ye all
