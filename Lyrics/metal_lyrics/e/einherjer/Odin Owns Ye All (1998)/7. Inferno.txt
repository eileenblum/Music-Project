Cold this night as you feel your fright
The horns of doom resound
White knight shines and you know why
The sky burns the giants light
Winter ends but what will come
The wolf the serpent the end
This the time for You and I
All Einherjer are gathered to fight

See the ship from Helheim comes
See the dead with Hel in front
I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe

An old oak shakes and its wisdom too
Waves are eager to feed
Gods falls as men so do men
The children of Loke the same
Some will be missed some will not
Some live forever in memory
The sun turns black as our mother drowns
The sky is touched by flames

See the ship from Helheim comes
See the dead with Hel in front
I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe

Now death is the portion of all doomed men
Shields clash and sharp swords bleed
Yggdrasil trembles it groans in woe
Red with spilt blood giants as gods
Garm howls at Gnipaheller
Fumes reek, into flames burst
The heavens split open
Well, would you like to know more...

I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe
