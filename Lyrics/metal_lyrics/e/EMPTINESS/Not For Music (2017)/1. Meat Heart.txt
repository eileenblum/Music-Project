The whole is a thought
Brewing the words
Few lines made of hope
I'm singing my bride, my girl
Her flesh is rejecting the being...

A rhythm was taking us for a dance
Swing your meat on the beat
Now melting with the ground
A tune in an arm
No rest left to go on
But I won't let you die

I would corrupt the earth, death, the sun
To keep life beating with you
The tool was breathing in our eyes
The grunge around you

I won't let your death spread around
When all life is made of you
Better to have all your pain here
Than your freedom alone outside

What would you be without me
To cover your dreams with gold
A gold that I've never earned
Your freedom devoted to myself
A privilege, a nowhere to go

Your flesh is cold for a while
A new odour defines you
Sleep, sleep deep my heart
Nowhere else to go...
