Crush this boring starving time
In naming days with insults
Helping the seconds to trap the minutes
Allow time to finish itself

Aged, often bitten by the needle
The horizontal being wrinkles to speak
Of course you can escape from it
Just bribe the sky and its offspring

Snatch this breaking distance
Embrace infinity in my house
Measurement, frustration
Kill the journey, kill the eagle
That's it

Leave space to become something close
A faraway not the same for all
Except when it's high and low
Directions should be a place
A place that soaks itself

Flesh, only the body
The flesh, worse than the mind
Worse than the brain projecting failures
Directions should be a place
A place that soaks itself

Mind, worse than flesh, worse than ennui
A tale for this flesh, to capture it

It's the reflection of the eye,
Brain wants to want, brain wants to sell
Life doesn't exist, or sometimes
When it's too hard to die without
Then it flies, to a god
No... to me

But probably not
