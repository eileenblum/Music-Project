Nothing is solid, nothing is straight
The creature uncouples itself to move
Crawls on the air, scratching the light
Spiraling down like the stairs in your house
Blind, stinky, and cracking bones as a call

It vomits dust made of skin
Malaise shoving back the whole
From your basement, to your hair
Even your feet on the couch
It vomits dust made of skin
Even spits up your dad in the sink
Elbows and knees as veins
An eye, a tunnel to draw men down

A cord linking the being to the clouds above
Like a straw to swallow you
Like a prey running to be caught
And cracking bones as a call
More of them are falling like rain
Mud is defeated by their drool
They drink it down, again, like a soup
And gargle it before swallowing
A jaded world in transition
Exposed to the hazards of evolution

The wild not digested
With the sound of gas rejected
Soon others will transcend them
With their crab-faces, screaming like princesses
And soon to blow themselves for their god

Imagine a dimension for it to appear
Leaving luck ripping off infinity
Something around pictures a singing ape
And now here I am to please you
