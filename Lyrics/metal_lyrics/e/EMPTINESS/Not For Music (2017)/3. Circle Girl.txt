A sun is holding a globe by the hands
So pleased to make it turn
"Kiddo, what is the buzz on you?"
Shouts of apes, the parasite

That's how the handicapped creature is born
Fooled by an old and deviant star
Welcome to the new big rock's show
Not allowed for you, grandpa

Hey primate! Swallow yourself
You toxic being of your becoming
Dig more and more in lethargy
Where my light will be spit

Muscles are wind for the bones
One day a carcass to gnaw
Limits are infinite and won't disappear

No visions, no hidden dimensions
Planets are worlds to conquer
Limits, infinity, never appear

Moon's desire threat
A blue to bury, a sky to fake it
Oh my sweet earth

Gross, bad dirty girl, you rock for the apes
Clouds pimples to pop, sand, insects to rot
Gross, bad dirty girl
Milk, mud, skin and bolt, melting with flowers

Knights and heroes failed, lava burning the sharks
Chewing the seeds of life, puking up the atoms
Crying the rivers, fat, breath, cuddling
Enlighten infinity, enlighten the ended man

No visions, no hidden dimensions
Planets are worlds to conquer
Limits, infinity, won't disappear
