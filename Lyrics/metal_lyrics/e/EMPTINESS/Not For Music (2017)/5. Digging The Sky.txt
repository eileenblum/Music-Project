Staring at words, into beings
Staring at a hole, a body
Digging up the soul, earth
Digging for a golden truth

The queen's staring at words, she is way more than the world, way more than the light.

[The substance my queen, her body a stone and the sky its rightful king
Their realm too lofty for my worth, too high for my being
Too high to dig up, my arm pushes through, gripping blossoms of spring
Here is where everything rests, where anything lives
My eyes are distant, my eyes are lazy, graverobber of morals
I dug way too low to climb back, too proud to look up
Alliance of thoughts, for to my dust of the blind, help me in defying the sky
Establishing invisible reign, and staring at gold]

I can only think, thinking that I am
She's way more than the world, a menacing sight
At the top of her tall white coat

[The queen is my mountain, she points at the blue, but holds us down to the ground
I can only think, thinking (that) I am, I am betrayed by the crown
Cheated by beauty obscene, a menacing sight
At the top of her might, and her tall white coat, throwing gods and science
Like crumbs to the rats in her lab, like bread for the crowd
Cut off the head, of my conscience and let me be - the roots of your wisdom
That brain is sucking my head, clearing the quest]

What does it want, that wind shivering seas, the fly laying eggs, the present that sticks?
What does it mean, the elastic power of an ocean, the need of the earthworm, the future that slides?
The code, hidden so badly, too obvious and noisy to unveil
I hear myself saying that all is sad
Never would I even imagine myself, licking your body laying under mine

Frustration, the shield of distant connections and never will I break the code
The search is pulling me down, too down to look back
The queen's staring at words, she is way more than the world, way more than the light
Excluded, vain, unable to react, to battle the lie in disguise
Digging for a golden truth. Digging the sky
