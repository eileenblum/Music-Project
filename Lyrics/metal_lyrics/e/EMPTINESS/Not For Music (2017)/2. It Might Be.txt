The light is born, a birth made to spread out and to sell us change
Her skin pours down the walls
And gloom isn't whole anymore, a dying being
My dream isn't whole anymore, and only wakes me to pretend

The light covers the truth
All is fake, this city gathers illusions
The untruth carried by the light
Let's move the bones and share solitude
When our star is shaking life, without consuming it yet
Let's play the game with style and show what is inside
This human stands reading the pages in quest of knowledge
Let's play the game with style and show what is inside

Oh, no... The answer is a stone, not a book
The other beg for a glance and shines to get read
Oh you, light forgot to lie, you're too usual to be seen
Let's play the game with style and show what is inside

Light, give birth to bones to feed dust
This cute newborn's here, his spirit's innocent
Who's humming a sweet tune?
The father, his seed grown in his arms
The cycle, is the child the answer?

It might be...

A shadow is born, a birth made to spread out
And repair the changes
Her skin pours down the walls
Light is out of fashion, when gloom conquers

The dark reveals the truth
It's still fake, but nothing to look at
The untruth carried by the light
Let's spare the bones and starve the dust

The father, his seed grown in his arms
The cycle, is the child the answer?
It might be, it can't be
