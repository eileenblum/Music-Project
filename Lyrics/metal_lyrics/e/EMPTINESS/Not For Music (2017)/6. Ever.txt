Wait for the crowd, wait for a signal
Speeding souls, shaking our brains for a star
My success, your failure, keep waiting for promises
Time is faking it, laughing and dressing itself like a "now"

Not for the songs, just for the light
Time cheats on patience while we cheat on our fans

Gold is near, shining like a huge star
Girls made of skin, heels on my leather
My success, your failure, keep waiting for promises
Time is faking it, laughing and dressing itself like a "now"

Gold is near, shining like a huge star
All for myself, never sharing with the band
A music played to reveal all our lies to the kids

Not for the songs, just for the light
Time cheats on patience while we cheat on our fans

There's no music, there's no crowd
No light or food for the soul
It's just eating you, helping you to fall deeper and deeper
Yeah this starving noise
