A morbid curiosity seized a being...
It's a human who, not having lived enough
Wanted to feel himself living, feel like it's finally starting
It's not all to take care of your teeth...
You need to know what you're worth in front of the mirror
And this little creature decided to taste the fruit

He prepared a toxic expedition
Detailed it with passion
Leaving would be easy, but how to come back to motion?
I must call you, my faithful friend, you like men
And dream of beyond the curtain
And you will have to make my heart beat again
But leave me there for a little while...

The liquid is injected...the heart is going to cease

I don't find myself being, but of emotions I'm aware
My body breathed me in and seems to mock me, fair
The light is identic, no surprises there
I see myself, finally, my body, a glare
Is body relevant? Is it flesh the ending?

I'm not judged, nor even stuck
It's just all that is there
I see you, you are life
And seem to get ready to take me back to land
But why this big smile on your face such a grin?
Why are you coming naked against my skin?
Facing this life that steals from behind...
