Think wise! Think catching your knowledge
But it's all around, it licks, and tastes
And denies itself by times
The spirit offended
The spirit that curves at the sight of the spirit
It all preys on, the pause offends
Still leftovers of a so-said cult legacy
Corrupted by the ancestors...
Feckless of being eternal...
The past is no more...
The past is death

Think having, think defending your turf
But once asleep, I will dance on your bones
The rhythm catches on, families loose their names
I balance, mashing the roots of the knowing
A laid-aside tale, a hero deserter
All waddling in the great feast of the error

Cuz the past is no more, the past is death
