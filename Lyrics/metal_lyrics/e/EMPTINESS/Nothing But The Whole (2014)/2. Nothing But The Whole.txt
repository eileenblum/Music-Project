She thrives on shadow, crawls under the city roofs
Penetrates colours and fragments the walls of regret
What am I? A bloody cursed snake?
No, the fault you moron...
She preys her own hand, a hand blessing your nights.
The one you don't fear but is scratching, itching your soul
So tell me what am I?

A strange animal is a man in front of a mirror
Even stranger is the man who observes that man
So where is the fault?
...And why must we drink and jump on the cycle
Why do questions cherish such answers?
Because...and here is the answer, for whole, life and death

I will not march in paradise, but you will sink with me
We will swim just as mermaids...will we?
We will sink and sink only, and you will sync with me
So tell me! Who am I?
I'm the question, the zero praised and forgotten
It's god that is truth, well we're still waiting for a sign

Zero praised and forgotten
The bloody cursed snake is now biting its own tail...
The whole joins the nothing for the course to be sick
Zero praised and forgotten
