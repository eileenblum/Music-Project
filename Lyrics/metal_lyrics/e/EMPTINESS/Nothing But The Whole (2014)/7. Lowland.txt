I am the lowlands, and the ladder
The one that leads you down
Eyes rest on you, streets swarm of life
Our star is dripping its heat
Females seem ready to impregnate
Shadow is cast out, optimism speeds up the cycle
Blackout is planned, to make shadow a ghost
And make sure to never be one amongst you...

No one knows, the taste of the infinite
Licking death...
No one knows what is the taste of the void

We should be able to do it, give the sun back to its master
We need space, the path is open, and devious we move forward...
Forward on the sly
But, to where?
No one knows, what they're doing

You think of yourself unique and safe on earth
But you're already dead...now face it
You may charge ahead, but your turn around
Seasons are there to remind you're just a pawn
Everything unwrapped and will unwrap more
And then believe, again, that you endure

I am the lowlands, I am heaven
The one that will take us further, from the sky
Forget about the sun, forget about your home
What does really matter...
When there's nothing but the whole
