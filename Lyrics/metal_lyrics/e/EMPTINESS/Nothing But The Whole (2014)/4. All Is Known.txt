Nothing is good for long, all is used
A world is hiding another
Collapsing the wall, such is the pleasure
However there is nothing worse...
So imagine boredom
The liquid and the light, the start and the end
Between the two, being the flaccid stone
Breaking out of the egg, and getting fried by the future
Walking straight into the trap

Dripping, rolling with you
Leaving footprints after us
We always wanna see so far ahead
To end up in the same cage
Far off, that smoke, the noise from the movement

Behind is still there, to push me forward
You think you're free but there are rails
Rails, loops, but nothing vertical

I shake of excitement, I have at last found
Once again the unknown gives some sense
Am I the one?

Concrete and anti-life, the celebration of a stage
The chemical to open oneself, and control hazard
Corpses are alive for a while
They dance, love each other...
All is blurring 'cause all is known
Each step tightens the knot more
