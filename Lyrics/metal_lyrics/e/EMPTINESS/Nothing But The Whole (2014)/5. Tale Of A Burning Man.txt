There's a man dressed in flames
That walks the land...
Barely there, and everywhere
Obsolete...
Stuck in a fire, how does it feel?
The price to pay is no redemptive

A bright raw movement
The blaze against life
A piece of Sun he swallowed to take off the skin
Shines from his whole, shines from his death

Wrath spreads while a hell of fire breaks
A man disappears, smoke clears, nothing resists
Stuck in a fire, how does it feel?
The price to pay is no redemptive...
