I had always known him, and he trusted me
We didnt say things, we felt them...
Whole is sick, sick and void
Go and hope, boy...
Hope for worse, the worst is now...

Sometimes we forget the fragility of moments
To believe in this line right?
I don't know how to tell you
But a being has disappeared
You watched him grow, and you won't see him again

He's been deprived of a life
Deprived to touch those dear to him
You conceived him, you loved him
But the plan changed...

Silence even sounds like it's him
Please, forgive me for tearing you
I'd love to, like you, think I might awake
But it's so real...
Real like ourselves breathing
Breathing no more...
He is dead, rotting there
Soon forgotten...
