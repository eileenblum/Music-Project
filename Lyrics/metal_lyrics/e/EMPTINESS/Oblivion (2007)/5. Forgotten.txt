The symbolic of a consuming white fire
Exceed the will some have for exodus
The idea of a body remembered as a dream
Drowned in this cursed hollow

Obsessions melt in the heat of fevers
Sulphuric stench gets sunken afterwards
Within the agony like ripped flesh
An age to be cast down forevermore

Hollow deep
The forgotten ones, the ones I've been
In forbidden time, it's outgrown to stay

Now that you burn between astral systems
Exceed the will some have for exodus
The idea of a body remembered as a dream
Drowned in this cursed hollow

Hollow deep
The forgotten ones, the ones I've been
Unforgiving minds, it's outgrown to stay

Hollow deep
The forgotten ones in forbidden times!
In all the agony, but now and never
It's your turn to stay
