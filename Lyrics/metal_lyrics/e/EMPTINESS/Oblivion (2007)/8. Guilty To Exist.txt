Guilty to exist:
A fucking none sense for weaks

From an internal war
And born on different strikes
We strike on the line
Wild-life is on our side

On your frost peace
A fucking none sense disease
Empty warriors slay the weak!

Be the one nihilist
Who's slaying the weak!
Onwards to slay the weak!

Straight one nihilist
We slay the weak
On your frost peace
Fucking none sense disease

Dominate your trinity
Switch on, dreams off
We are the rage, plague, evil, nihilism!
