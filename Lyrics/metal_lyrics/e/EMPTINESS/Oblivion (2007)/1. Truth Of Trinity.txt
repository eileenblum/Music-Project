Closer to the wrath
Unbreakable inside
The threats which never fail
Are rising through the shades

Arising
The truth of trinity
Reminds our shields
Dead life, the truth of trinity
Hybrid hypnosis within our dead life
Hybrid hypnosis, inferno inside

Closer to the serpent
Our future is compromised
Severe threats relapsed with reasons
Are rising through the state

Underneath the soil
Incubate, forlorn
We'll shape the oath with all energies

Inferno inside, during my dead life
We'll shape the oath with your oblivion
