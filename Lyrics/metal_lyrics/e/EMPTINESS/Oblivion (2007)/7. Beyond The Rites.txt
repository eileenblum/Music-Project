Our promised land will rise...

Born to scratch entities and lies
Prone hatred for everything
Follow the codes
As centuries destroy them
Beyond the rites

Our promised land has come...

Eternity is our home
In this realm we have dominated
Because now they serve
Obviously extracted
Beyond the rites
