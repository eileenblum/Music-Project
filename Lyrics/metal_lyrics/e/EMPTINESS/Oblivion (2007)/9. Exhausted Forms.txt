Descent beyond this nothing
Defragmented pieces of the "I"
De-corporated!
The source of outer worlds reveals
This space upside down

Outer limits, for all directions
Infinite mind creates the forms
Antibody vibes are fading away
The thousands ways you crossed
So much ways to be extinct

Leading oblivion to banish the known
Erase now your being
For a newborn maze of life

Hereafter limits
Infinite mind creates the function
Prevailed forces conceive existence
Among all systems
All the way, all shall be exhausted
