Face damnation to deserve it
Hold this distance of life
We'll be king to crush this ignorance
No senses alive to destroy it

We'll crush your ignorance
Rebirth!

The oath is lost, we restore the tales
Recognition, disaster increased
Inborn believes, a distress to dissect it
The clash of universes has begun

We are kings, we crush your ignorance
No senses alive to recreate it
We'll crush your ignorance
Rebirth!

Beside those glances of ignorance
Those killing words were read forded
Reflecting, in fools an indent, hidden weakness

To be king to crush this ignorance
