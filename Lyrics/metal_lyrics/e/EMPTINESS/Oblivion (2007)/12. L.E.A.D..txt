The entrance of purgatory:

Rising soul; mighty ritual of a dying flesh
Words of pain, pleasure in suffering
Now it's time for us, to celebrate the day of doom
We are born in an eternal chaos; prostrate yourself!

Triumph of hell, hail for victory!
Centuries of sorrow for your kingdom
Our trophy takes its life from human bleeding

A world upside down
Symbol of our entity
For eternity
Burn the gods of weakness

Inno ritual
Lead us Satanas
In this crusade for your suffering
Extermination!

Symbol of our entity
For eternity
Burn the gods of weakness

Just hold back all the tears of the weak
The cause how evil will all dry them out
Locked in this jailed conception now!
An inner form of predators hunting fools

Far beyond my flesh and blood
Wrapped by an armour of pain
The chosen one gives life to flames
They will take it as an offence
An offence to innocence
Blasphemy shall raise our soul to hell
