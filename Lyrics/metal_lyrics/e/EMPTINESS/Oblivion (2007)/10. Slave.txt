Reborn from his ashes
A shapeless spirit's entity
This is what men preach!

Cursed for wars in worlds
This spirit's entity is where you've been

In the never: build your last way
Forget yourself, slave

Reborn shapeless a thousand times
Trapped in the way of rising down
Confess and the virtue will build
New structures of devotion

In the never...

Unknown forms of existence
Stand through lives and forbidden times
Face the empty fields
Live your fears, leave your mind
