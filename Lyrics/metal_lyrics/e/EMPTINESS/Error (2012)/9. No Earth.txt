Logic and evidence feed my hate
I implore images self-destruction
Donât even think youâre something
Youâre nothing you suck 
And still man would be his own God?
I think Iâve met this very God one day
He was quite nice
He taught me never to believe and I believed Him
Youâd better worship your dirt
Your beloved child
Your shape to remind your betrayal
Donât ever start to believe in yourself
Youâre worthless
Youâd better worship your dirt
Fight the Earth
Without whom youâd be dead
Donât even think youâre something
No Earth is a path
Youâre nothingâ¦

I know youâre nothing
