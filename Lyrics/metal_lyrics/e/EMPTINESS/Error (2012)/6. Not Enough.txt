I have fallen through a hole
Where I saw myself
But not enough
Those words are corrupted
I am not enough Iâm nothing and Iâm waiting
Because motion itâs just stupid 
And itâs all about here and now enough
Iâm backing off my weariness and at souls commend
Desires are springing forth canât stop wonât stop
Itâs a real shame to never fall
An adversary future and a wasted past
I want more but itâs not enough
When Iâll be dead Iâll hang around
But not enough
The important never was I require less
But itâs still not enough
