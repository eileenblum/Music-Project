Desires are springing forth
The shock of resentment
A weight is running down my veins
The one that revels against gravity
I am my own pollution and the curse of my thoughts
Forced to leave something behind
Attention always seeks a target as there is no gain
No more substance neither 
The cors of blood
I might be empty dissolved and left from my absence poisoned of my own breath
Harmful and shaped washed away to nothing
Left neither the core of dream 
No more substance neither 
The core of blood
