I spit out all Heavenâs mercy on those who truly believe they are completion
As a prison unthinkable 
Being not accomplished I free glimpses of truth
A common face sadly ended
Everything is âdeathâ 
My friend donât you realize places lived away
Crush time and land 
Different nows to crush space and void
The void is the land
Your mistake is your will to believe and mind to stand here and witness
Existing while we are not and feel under my feet the land
Your soul confronted to the worst
Scared to rot more and more
I cuddle her with the back of my hand secured
She wonât go far
Time hates little nothings
It has split eternal in different nows
Sand crawls backwards in the hourglass
Claiming the dawn of an endless sleep
Disappearing to let death disappear
I wish I could scream silence
Life is a fault where remove sneaks
I wish I could scream silence
Praying for lines to fade away
Pray to fade away
I wish I could scream silence
Disappearing to let death disappear
Pray for lines to fade away and that thing wonât dare to think
A pierced eye to read the âIâ
