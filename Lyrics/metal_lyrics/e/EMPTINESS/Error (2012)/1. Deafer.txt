This is the object of conscience betraying the thought
Soothe it with words meaning lies 
Everywhere around turns you blind
Makes you fake
Wasted in the desert of time
Life was/is/shall be a miracle
Logic drowned directions and consumed the in-between-early-and-late
You are sand grain of time you stink like water
Youâre wide as the atom
You are nothing and pray to nothing
The axis can not hear but Iâm listening to you 
Gone pale forgotten
Nullity obvious error
I cannot hear but I listen to you nobody nonentity
Useless void essence forced
I cannot hear but I listen to you an echo for the deaf slow radiant
Shock dull tired an echo for the deaf
Betray the thought I cannot hear but I listen to you
Forsake desert tell again against against
I cannot hear but I listen to you
