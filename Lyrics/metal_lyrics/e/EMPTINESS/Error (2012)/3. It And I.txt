Maybe I should apologize to feel even lower
My words are empty
I fail at the language of animals
Eat feast on my shame
This is your territory
My shield is the void
A hunt for gods you undertake
Your hunt for gods to undertake
It and I are errors
Feed from time and colors
I am your waste
