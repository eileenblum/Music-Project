Am I the grave of the land or just the shape of dirt
Tired to become to begin to end
There is something coming
Am I the grave of the land Iâm yearning for an empty goal
To bless your fault your lapse you
All I know I fall 
Error feeds from time and color not enough
My error Iâve reached the shape of a man but still a man of dirt
Tired to begin again and again
Bored that something is coming
I am the grave of the land and just a man of dirt
Tired to become to begin to fail
There is something coming
