I found my home in the sky for all time
And when I am home I grow wings to fly by
Then I touch ground but my mind is soaring high
I found my home in the sky for all time

And when I am home I grow wings to fly by
I found my home in the sky for all time
Then I touch ground but my mind is soaring high
I found my home in the sky for all time
