Erect a monument to me for I alone am your king
The virgin sand is my queen a royal legend I will be
I will build a kingdom for the age the river of life points the way
All hear the prayer that we sing welcome to the valley of the kings

Even the light worships the sun remember everything I have done
And let this stone forever bring life to the valley of the kings
Erect a monument to me for I alone am your king
All hear the prayer that we sing welcome to the valley of the kings
