The earth will stand the stars in my hand to seek the sign the queen of all time
And in the final end will the future begin to seek the sign the queen of all time
With a fantastic light she opens the sun the planets swell stage four has begun
The earth in my hand the stars I command to seek the sign the queen of all time
With a fantastic light she opens the sun and the planets swell stage four has begun

Omega run to the center of the universe
Plot the course and head straight for the other side
To a place where all eyes unify Omega run, Omega run
In flight with the son of Icarus bowed down at the feet of Orion
The sky built a shrine above my head asleep in the arms of a giant

I see it - from the mountain
I see it - from the mountain
Red Giant - on the mountain
I see it - from the mountain
I see it - from the mountain
I see it - from the mountain
A Red Giant - I'm on the mountain
I see it - from the mountain
