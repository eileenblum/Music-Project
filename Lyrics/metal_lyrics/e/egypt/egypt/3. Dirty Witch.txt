You are such a dirty witch when you are holding out your hand
But when you smile, it shines across the land
In your evil mind you climb through space and time
But we are landlocked here, there is nothing more sublime

With your hovering magic you fly right through the sky
You know what I saw, and it opened up my eyes
I looked to easy when you opened up the sun
In the distance smiling, I know your work is done

You are controlling my mind putting wicked thoughts inside
And now my body is shaking and I am not doing fine
In mysterious ways your eyes burn like the stars
You want it all, and everything will be ours

I have got you in my heart and I am not doing fine
Now that you are in my heart I am going to keep you warm inside
