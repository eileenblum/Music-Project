My sap is cup of vine
It's free for public use
My thoughts are going down
And my heart feels confused

My friends are very clever
Don't tell me how pull the trigger
My girl is best girl ever
She taught me my love is illegal

And I can't cry

Let's dance, oh please, let's dance, babe
While my end coming near
I just want to be insane
I'm swimming in my fever
Whose tears be sprinkle last bed
Except the one got my blood
Who cares my only faith's dead
If no one cares while it was alive

And I can't cry

Eternal darkness coming
But I am not afraid
I need her warmth and calm
At gate where my life fade
I can't cry
And I can't lie
And I can't feel you anymore
Stretched wings
By deadly winds
The end of story I've been told
