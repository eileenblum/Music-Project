I feel the pain of real
No matter where I am
I've seen the blood on skin
Every day I dwelt
I'm squashing all my thoughts
To be the one who win
But all the same I burst
I feel the pain
Of real

And I see the light
Can it help cognise us?
And I see the light
Can it help cognise us?

A chronic wish to be
The viewless has done first step
My moral pain's relieved
By lies of breathing land
I'm squashing all my thoughts
To be the one who win
But all the same I burst
I feel the pain of real
