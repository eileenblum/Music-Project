And the silent expanse
And the twilight of genes
And the sere burgeon of Sense
And the splashes of reals

I blame myself For my deceitful decease
Oh, Sigh
I am surely not a proper thing to be dealt with
You do
Somehow I am always occupy somebody's places
Not mine
But where's my own
I'd never told nobody

Golden ardour of Phoebus' love
Emanation of heat
Only lizards are on the ground
Only void is inside of me

Your claws are in me
No matter why
You want me bleed
You want me die

I can't withstand rain
It's coming wild like beast
I'm ceding up to drench
Laving, laving your seeds
My pinions I will spread
To flee away
Dying isn't the gift you got
Blaze, abasement and fear
Trickling down from lips disgust
Forgiveness through tears
