Why, why did you call me
Everytime and everywhere
I can't resist forever
I can't stand for a fake
Rend me, oh, rend me slowly
Every nerve and every cell
And you will find inside of me
Bitterness and death

Touching me deadly
Crumbling away
Torturing me sadly
It's all about all my born days

All my born days

Times of, times of repentance
And the shadows on the wall
I can't resist forever
I can't stand anymore
I know, I know those passions
And temptation and the price
But I believe in nothing
Hallucinations of life

Days coming to haze
It's only maze
And I follow this inside
All my burn days
