I'm falling down from sky
I'm seeing you far beneath
Eternal, everlasting fly
Like tender drops onto your eaves
I'm falling down to you
I don't afraid of stones
I'm Immortal, I always new
If you bestow me sacred love

I want to hit the stupid ground
I want to blow in thousand pieces
I want to flow down tons of blood
If I forced live without you

I'm falling on your hands
They're always waiting for me
Your lips are whispering name,
Name I used to be
Innocent tears on blood
In state of silent cry
Did you ever know
Woman as a Prime?

I wanna hit...
I wanna blow...
I wanna kill...
If I forced live without you
