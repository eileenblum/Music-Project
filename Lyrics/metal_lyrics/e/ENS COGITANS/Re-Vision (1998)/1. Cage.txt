I'm dozing into cage of hate
My clay's reposing somewhere near
The sleepy wadding blocked up access
To door outside. I adjure to deliver
Oh let me see the ray of light
Let me fawn on, me and my fever
My bars so stout, my eyes so blind
The only thing I've - (my) clingy fear
I have no chance
To be awoken
Even if I'll die
I'm given lies

I'm living in my dreams
I'm living in tomorrow
My heart is bleeding
But it'll open up the cage

Sometimes I taste the humid air
Sometimes and wind rush in my face
Sometimes I really need your hands
I do not want to be a waif
I feel the same you used to feel
But all my deeds are formed by cage
My mind's sophisticated drill
Processing out there
