Deception is not in your lies
Oblivion is not in my self
A lovely day in bloody cries
The pervert way to my private hell
Just walking on the leathal blade
The snake's on skin, but it exites
The step you took, the kiss I made
The tunnel of sin. The scare's inside

It's so clear, it's so vaguely
You can behold, I cannot
Since I blind bird, I learn flying
With no reason, just as I want

I'll show you dance, I'll teach you speak
But I cannot describe the love
My vision's gloom, I'm old and sick
In arrogance I rest in dole
Deception is not in your lies
Oblivion is not in my self
A lonely age in frosen rhymes
The only way - don't try to escape
