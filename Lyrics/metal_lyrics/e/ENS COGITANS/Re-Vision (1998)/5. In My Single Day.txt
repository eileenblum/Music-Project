I was awoken under tree
And its color - grey
The flowing sap is on my knees
No, I couldn't slay
Whose blood it was and am I right
To see my arms in red?
Who'll give forgiveness and place to hide,
If even you don't understand?

I hate to follow
But I have to do it well
I touch the sorrow
Like the fingers touch my neck
You explained the difference
Or it's demon in his eyes
It's kind of defence
But it changed my way of life

Investigation's view inside
Maybe it was you
The innocence is relative lie
Lie in deep of truth
The demon in eyes cruel so much
Forced to be so racked
I've spent your life for single touch
Touch of love on neck

In my single day
