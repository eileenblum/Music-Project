Crystal wall. Avarice.
Prone on sod in profusion
I'm missing you. Misbelief.
Theatrics of delusion.
I mesmerized by own rave
I persuaded that it is true
My sanguine sap evaporates
But I for ever dote on you

No demons, no lions,
I'm dying in your hands again

Verdict done. Execute.
Put me at the pillory
I'm missing you. I've got due
I and me... and memory
