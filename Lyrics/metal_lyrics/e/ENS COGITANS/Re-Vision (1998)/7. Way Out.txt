I touch your neck, I feel the heat
The Nature of mine has to bleed
I have to hurt, I have to drink
The silly ending of my dreams
I am dwelling like vampire
Suck the feelings and feed my greed
I am still no have the entire
Hollow space, blank paper's sheet

No way out from here

I watch your step. I always next
Who wants to put the fangs inside
The female blood oh has to run
The hunt on love is unbound.
I am living by your breathing
I've no body, but have pride
I am looking for integrity,
But on other side
