Waves hold me down
But doesn't take away my breath
Gulls're flying up
To very azure stately surface
They're flying up
And trying kiss my pallid lips
I've been shown the world
In which we couldn't never meet

Controling bent, controling treat
Controling every shiver you did
The calm of herbs, the still of sky
The state in which you'll never die

You've got no place to burn it out

Small fishes swims
Breaking their straight rows
They're playing with
Little bubbles from my nose
Transparent jelly-fish envelops me
Its stinging bite
Ressurects longing to be

No matter how, no matter where
I vanish in your every glance
The sunshine is refracted in
Emerald water in which I sink
Step behind
Sea into your eyes untie
Step behind
I don't think I have to lie
