My Death is in earnest.
It's the logical end (of mine).
I must go to the mysterious Land.
The Absolute now may be slaked.
The Past crumbling away.
My time has come,
I have to pay.

The play goes on, I lost Thee.
(I am no longer me).
Now I wash off grease-paint.
Curtain crushed my ethereal dreams.
My physical Ego lies in state.

All to nothing. So be it!

Levin took me to the World Fine.
Mentality built my bower in the mountains.
The lined body of mine died.
Grains of Mind cleared from membranes.

Who we are? Where are we from?
Fourth Race.
Do we know our History
Before Christ was crucified on the Cross?
Wreck you own. Step into
Eternal Space.
Human beings won themselves.
Great Sorrow (rising over the Universe).

Uncanny wainds ensnaring your will.
You have no shape, you have no words.
Around your essence is absolute nil.
You're on the threshold of the Unknown.

[Solos: The Unfleshed Element, Stone Rill]

Deep inside I feel my sadness gnawing me.
I've got the affright.
I'm roaming through this boundless sea.
I've got the aim, but I don't see a hint of course.
I'm the errant one. I am between worlds and I'm cursed.
Chorus Of The Damned.

I'll tell you more than truth.
I'll tell you what I feel.
I'll tell you my innermost dream.
You better close your eyes,
You better close your ears,
And give yourself up to stream.

I see the sunset on mead.
The incarnadine Day-star bid farewell to me.
The last shafts of light are buried in the creek.
Invisible steeds I can feel.
Their blindness hinders them to see.
No water. Nourishment is weeds.

[VOICE OF EVIL UNKNOWN:]
Odour of Guilt
Return your home
Be a King
Know 'bout all.

[SPLIT INDIVIDUAL:]
The terrestrial stretch of mine has elapsed
Now I free from the Hive!
I'm not sorry for what I've done.
I decided die!

And my ephemeral human life ends.
My Nous obtained by space into Space.
It's soulful level, which everyone will reach.
The only way to realize human futility.
Epilogue. Music by M. Mathoney.
Here I take you, Queen of Death, (King of Gloom)
To my wedded wife (man), to have and held
At bed and at board for fairer, for fouler
For better, for worse, in sickness and in health
Till new life us do part
And thereto I plight thee my throth
In the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit!
Amen!
