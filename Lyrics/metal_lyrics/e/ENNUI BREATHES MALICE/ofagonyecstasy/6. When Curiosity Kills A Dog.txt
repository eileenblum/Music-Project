Rotting inside - Decayed!
Shit hits the fan - A lack of mercy clears the room;
I designed it to humiliate you!
Such courage and compassion would humble me, had it been real....
Who truly believes your lie?
Do you find solace in ridicule?
Black is a fad - Attacks all beauty in the room; In the room....
Ape those who walk by, while eroding inside!
Curiosity is a fashion that could topple you with looks that could kill.....
I deny it, to stay different from you - Cripples me with looks that could kill
Slice your magenta lips - Spills no vanilla!
Now slit your frail wrists - Still no vanilla - Pale your faces!
Rotting inside!
I hate your pale face - Go slit your fucking wrists bitch!
Bleed - Slut!
