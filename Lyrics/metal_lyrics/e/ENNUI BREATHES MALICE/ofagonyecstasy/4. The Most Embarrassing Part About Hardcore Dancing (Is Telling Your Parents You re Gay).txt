Destroy the memory you cling to - Eradicate the memories you hate!
Beating the black from the beige - Wipe that smirk straight from your face!
Bleed - Then leave......
Nostalgia in the shapes i sketch - Paper reinvents the pen!
Months fall from a calendar in what you call a life!
Begin again! Do we begin again? Fuck!
Do we truly begin again? Again....
Ink the distance; Shade the tears!
I swear you could scrape them straight from the page, and then you would see.....
The thick grows thin!
Who drew this destiny for you? Lust leaks from the creases!
Proves the water is not thicker than blood.....
Blush you fucking whore!
