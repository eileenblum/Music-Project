Who do you fucking pray to? Is it him or her....
And what if they don't want to speak anymore?
I ask no questions - I have no voice - You'll stay unfaithful - That is your choice!
It's your choice.....
The only break in silence; An instant message tone
And the shock of a conversation window being quickly closed
Don't you judge me! Open your fucking eyes and take a good look at me....
Sever yourself from cyber-world and seek reality!
I struggle to find reason in such a world
Where a fourteen year old virgin is hard to come by anymore
But I ask no questions - I have no voice - You're still unfaithful (Bitch)
That is your choice....
No one's listening - No one fucking cares - Nobody knows!
Don't you judge me! Don't you judge me!
Find - Something real - Real
Put your fucking faith inside of me; Put your fucking trust, in something real....
Find someone real - Find yourself something real...........
