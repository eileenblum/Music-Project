Vanity has too long punished all those that crave respect -
Yet you adorn your useless name with disgrace!
You will not like, what i have to say....
You'll take offence to every word i say - Your greed for pussy..........
It makes us sick! It makes me sick....
Buy her a drink, go take a dance, tap that arse!
Buy me no drink - Sip your own shame!
Buy her a drink, tap another arse - Sip your own fucking shame!
His heart now drops and shatters; Could the shards cut her throat to settle him down?
And would the pieces puncture our lungs to drain all our lives of pride again?
It makes us sick - You make me wish that girls were clever!
Before i spit, I will flip - I will flip that collar down
Pastelle shades lie - Liar!
It makes me sick....
You make me wish girls were clever....
Before i flip your collar down, i will spit in your face - Pastelle shades lie!
