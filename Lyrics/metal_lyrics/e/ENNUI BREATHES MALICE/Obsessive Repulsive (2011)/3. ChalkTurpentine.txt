All highs become low eventually - Your art no longer depicts reality! Gravity alone won't keep your feeble head below the clouds or under control! The liquid is now aware of all you pains; The powder is now accustom to every dent in your ego! Are you afraid too? Drown your sorrows - Escape tomorrow - Drown yourself - Choke your grotty fucking self! All nights become day inevitably - Your heart no longer accept sobriety - Your heart no longer respects life! All highs become low in the end! Whilst lying on your death bed, will anyone weep? Sitting by your death bed - They won't fucking weep. What goes up often fights coming down - Are you afraid now?
