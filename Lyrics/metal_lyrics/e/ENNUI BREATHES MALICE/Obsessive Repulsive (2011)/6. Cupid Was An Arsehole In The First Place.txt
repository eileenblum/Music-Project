Now your hope is an unstable emotion - Love is an unkind emotion! Love erodes - Hope is an unstable emotion! Now will the guns stay obscure? No smile for me - And will the tear finally fill all the glasses of those with whom we speak? Of the prospects in which we meet! Paradise is floating on a gravel sea of indecency - Piss upon trust until it burns! Watch it burn! We deflower the roses, Then clip the little fuckers wings! We take our pleasures from the same generic brands, tongue in cheek as dick touches teeth - Love erodes - Hope preserves no devotion! Now will the gums stay obscured? Zero grin for me - But shall my fears gradually breach these fragile glasses, As hope depletes? Snap the arsehole's arrows - Insert the dirty rose petals deep in his throat! Crush his bow - Snap all arrows - Then deflower every fucking rose!
