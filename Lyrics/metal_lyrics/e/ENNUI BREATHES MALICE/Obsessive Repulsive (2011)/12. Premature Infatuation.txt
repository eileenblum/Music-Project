Grow! Bloom! Grow! Screams perturb is from shallow perspective, As orgasm drips - An orgasm drips from the ceiling, It accentuates my regret! (You) Convince me this is fucking real - Convince me this is real again! The quivers felt between these filthy stale sheets appropriate regret! We'll plant a seed of lust and need - Grow aware of deceit: Plant your fertile seed to grow aware of this blooming misery! Dreams alert us all - They alert us all to feigned attraction, As perfection slips - Perfection slips down through evening! (You'll) pretend that this shit isn't fucking real - Convince yourself that its all surreal! Shivers become contagious via frozen feet; These shivers - These quivers - Emphasise regret! When more than enough is less then nothing - Nothing will ever be enough! Enough is enough! - I feel like nothing, And nothing will ever be enough for you! Fuck your lust away! Fuck your love away! THen fuck your life away! Oh, FUCK YOU!
