Flush away the despair! No! I wear the badge in this relationship - Most sane and greatest fuck you'll never, ever have again! I bear the turmoil through all of it - CUm stains and the truest love in which I'll never come to experience again! But who will? Who will? And surely you know - Surely you know the next six inches, cannot gate and never fucking will! He only uses you to wet his tip - And aims to dislocate your hips, That worthless piece of shit! Shit! Hypothetically, what if we - Hypothetically. What if we came to be NO! Little pig! Little pig! Let me in! Let me in! Little pig! Let me in! Greedy little pig, You've flushed away what we once had! Surely you know, This next short sentence, Won't sustain us, But fucking should; Hypothetically - What if we raised that family? We'll never know! Never know! We will never fucking know! I'm number one in a number two business - But who wants to know?
