Remember! I'll always remember who I am!
Peer beyond the cataracts and through your clouded hourglass.....
Welcome the birth of mental demise - Welcome, to the failure of function!
Befriend this anonymity as all you have; I too question this ego, but hold no shame for the millions of tears I caused to plague your cheeks and flood the floor â
Flood with remorse! Where is the shame? There is no space for shame!
Now timereveals you bear a blemish on your mind;
Life creates rhyme without reason! We sit cock in hand like fools!
Hold your swollen cock - Begin to pull.....
Nightly repose follows harsh masturbation; In a pulse of sheer exhaustion,
I feel no remorse for the thousand times I've fucked your face in my perverted mind â Inside our minds! Where is the shame? No fucking room for shame!
You dream! But not of me! Don't you dare! Don't you dare ever think of me!
Don't you fucking dream of me? Don't you dare think of me!
Don't you ever fucking dream of me? By scorn or the slow decay of time, my passing
will not mean anything more than a sudden murmur of your fossilised heart!
(Mummified heart - Open your heart)
Before the fountain has dried, I will not have forgotten your name......
Will you forget?
