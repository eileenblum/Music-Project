Why this vibrant Tuesday he was liberated yet somehow strangely, Held fugitive! Twelve newly received text messages - Electronic distance stained by the briniest of tears! Have you seen the sky today? His wish was to ride its acrid breath - What lack of affection could drive a man to this? Crimson lids by the cliff where he lay! Guilt peers persistently at me through the gap in my grief - All truth is bruised by the gleam in its eyes! He'll never achieve their excellence or any fondness; Constant shame cast upon him by his peers! Future thought can mar the present - No end justifies the means! Anxiety scorched from the sun to accompany everyone through their years of coming melancholy; Selfishness only fractures a family - Fractures communities! Plasma soaks each wave so gently, As they bludgeon against his shattered limbs - Plasma rinses the sand so delicately, Whilst it cradles his haemorrhaged skin! Selfishness only fractures humanity! Have you seen the sky today?
