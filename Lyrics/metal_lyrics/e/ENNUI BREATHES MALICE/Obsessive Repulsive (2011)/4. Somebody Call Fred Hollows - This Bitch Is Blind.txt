Change! See me! Alter the way that you see! Change the way you look - Look for a way to change! Alter the way in which you see yourself and you'll find change! Frustration attires itself in a dress of custard hue tonight, And disdain is the opal pendant hanging down toward its perfect breasts, And porcelain flesh - But it no longer emanates is lavender, As we sniff the lividity and hatred in the atmosphere! I'd carve a tiny cartoon heart into that fucking chest, Where the love once grew; And I'd scrape that mini foreign symbol from your lower back (Slut) If I were you! She sees no simplicity - No glimpse of a future here with me - Will she ever fucking see? Her disease; It is much more apparent than the warm, pearl fluid trickling down from her chin! I don't fucking want you - I only need you to fucking see - Please see!
