Tragedy! Words bitten by the frost of your heart send love - Smudged lipstick looks like blood - Looks like blood - Blood! Sweat that thought into a plastic cup then dry your eyes of me - I'm scrubbing each and every one of those ridiculous ideas! You're just another set of (fake) eyelashes and pair of splendid, perky tits! Death frowns a dagger toward her - Ot scowls a bullet directly her way - Death finds a way - Death will taint our days! Shoot your thoughts into a mouldy tissue box and wipe your thigh til clean - I'm washing away every trace of the scum in this insidious reverie! The only difference between azure and pink, All depends on the pressure of your lethal fucking grip - Get a grip! Tragedy has no reason - No purpose in my life! No reason! No tragedy has no fucking reason in out lives - None! Tragedy has no fucking reason in our lives. It will never have any purpose here in our lives!
