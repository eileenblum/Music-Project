[Feat. Dan Boyle of Sirens]When it all comes to the surface, when it all comes crashing down on you,
Will you realize I was there for you (I was there for you).
The probability of me being here when you realize what you've done is slim to fucking none.
I wonât stand for this. You will feel my pain.

Retrace your, retrace your, retrace your steps to this day and no oneâs standing behind you.
Disillusion starts to kick in, and everything starts to make sense.
So who is standing behind you now?
Retrace your, retrace your, retrace your steps to this day and no oneâs standing behind you.
So here, hereâs to the past, hereâs to realizing the last five years of your life was a lie.

Everything, everything, everything, everything wonât wait.
I sure as hell wont wait for you.
I've done everything I can, to pull you back in.
This is the last time you will ever speak my name.
This is the last time we will ever make a memory.
I have tried to set things right, why walk on broken glass if you donât have to.
I know youâre broken, but some things aren't worth being fixed.
Iâve seen it so many times everyone in this room they have turned their backs on you, and Iâm not gonna stick around to see you tear your self down.
I swear with every ounce of strength I have inside of me, Iâll see your face in hell.
you, will, walk, alone.

Retrace your, retrace your, retrace your steps to this day and no oneâs standing behind you.
Look at the man Iâve become with no thanks to you, and ill stand my ground...stand my ground
