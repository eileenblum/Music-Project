Sit back and let me recall everything you said to me.
This convoluted fantasy world that you claim to see.
Youâll never know until you open up your eyes.
This is, everything, I have, to say.
This is, everything, I have, to say.

You will knowâ¦
Pushing forward to find youâre something more then this.
Everything you have been taught in the world will never make sense.
Will it be something you learn to live with or will you strive to be something anomalous?
This is everything that I have.
This is everything. Itâs everything I am.
Itâs not the first time that Iâve been here and it wonât, it wonât be my last.
Itâs not the first time that Iâve been here and it wonât, it wonât be my last.
Making progress everyday, I will live the life thatâs meant for me can you say the same.

How does it feel to know youâre worthless?
How does it feel to know youâre worthless?
