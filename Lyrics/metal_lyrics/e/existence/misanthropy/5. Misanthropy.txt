I would have sacrificed everything.
Everything I have inside of me.
I would have given my all.
If only I had the strength to.

I wish I could go back to when it was all so simple.
I could smell the ocean air. I could feel the ground beneath me.
Everything in this world it was all so tangible.
But I had all my hopes and dreams deeply suppressed inside of me.
I donât know how I got to this place and Iâm not quite sure how I will make my way out.
But one things certain.
One thing I know for sure, take it or leave it, I am who I am.
BOUNCE!
I, I tried, I tired to give, it all to you.

Iâm tired of talking about redemption.
I will not longer forfeit these feelings.
I will see you in the trenches.
When everything is said and done what have you done to change the way you live your life, the way you life your.

I will tear apart everything you know.
You know nothing.
You know nothing at all
