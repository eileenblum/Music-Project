Itâs not supposed to be like this.
This wasn't how I had it all mapped out.
It seems as though every person in this world just lets me down.
Itâs not supposed to happen like this, where do I go from here.
Seventeen and Iâm fearing for my life and I don't know if Iâll make it out alive.

Take a step back and look at what you've done with your life.
Are you proud of who you become?
What makes you better then me?
Is it the fact you can lie through your teeth?
You're a fake, you're a cowered and I wont let you live this down.
You will never live this down.
I have tried to make the best of my life.
I have tried, but I only let myself down.
I have tried. I only let myself down.

I canât stand to look in the mirror, I canât stand who I am.
Iâm so uncomfortable in my own skin, I shouldn't feel like this.
I donât know what Iâm doing with my life, I donât know where I stand.
What am I fighting for?
Iâm fighting for
THIS, IS, MY.
This is my chance to prove myself.
THAT, I.
I am worth the effort, Iâm worth the struggle.
Iâve heard it time and time again you wont amount to anything I pushed my self,
I made it this far.
Nothing can stop me now if I am willing, you cant stop me now.
Stop me now.
You canât stop me now.
You will pay for your ignorance and self-absorption, you will pay for everything.
You will pay for your ignorance and self-absorption, you will pay for everything you did
