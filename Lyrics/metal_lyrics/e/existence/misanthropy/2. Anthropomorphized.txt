Where is your master?
Where is the one who promised you salvation?
I watched every one in the world succumb to a power they know nothing of.
They wait like cattle on their knees to answer this higher powers every beck and call.
Welcome to the new reign, say hello to the face of evil.
They will never give in so we must force them to abnegate their throne.

Follow me, you wonât be left behind if you get off your knees.
No oneâs coming back for you.
I have seen the pain that is caused by simply doing nothing.
Will we stand aside and let their fear control our lives?

I am only man, I am doing everything that I can.
I am only man, when will this life be enough for you?
