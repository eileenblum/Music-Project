Tonight I'm square, today I'm round,
Yesterday's gone, tomorrow's blind
I'll grow a thil I'll sprout out wings,
I'll be a thundering giant or a puny thing

I go through ages,
Evolving
I go through storms
Always changing, always moving...

You'lle see me through the light and the dark
I'll call your fancy like a passing lark.
I'll be your toy then I'll be your tyrant
And before you know it, i'll show you oblivion

The one always changing...
Evolvent...
Oh, I'll be a thousand shapes
Some to your liking...

I'll learn your langage and strip it to meaning...
I'll take all your beliefes and make them empty
And when you finally realize your mistake,
I will be something else.
