Evolution has betrayed us once again
Just when we thought we were top of the chain
Mother Nature has pulled out the rug
If you ask me, it was not soon enough

(Usufferable humans, I'm here to reclaim
What you though was yours to pillage
When it was mine
I twill always  mine)

Naked apes,unprepared for harshness
no more cars or cellphones, we stood helpless
Welcome to the great genetic downturn
When we finally understand how frail we are

Under a bloodlesss sky - we crawl
New predators arise, we don't hold the game
Under a bloodlesss sky - we cower
I'm afraid I missed my last train home

It ends not in a bang but a whisper
What we took for granted, we must fight for
Pampered, unprepared, we fear thw coming night
Self-induced victims of our monumental pride

(Unsufferable humans, you destroyed all that I gave
Now it's time for you to crawl back in you caves
Whil I claim what's mine
Always to be mine.)

Under a bloodless sky -  strain
Listless generation, protected fron any pain
Under a bloodless sky - We cower
And wish we could have made so much better.
