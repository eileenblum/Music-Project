Above me the sky is on fire, 
Under the cold earth is rumbling,
Bombs exploding, bullets tracing
Deep in my chest, my heart is pouncing.
Too long we stood in line (cattle)
Too long each day we died (inferiors)

Oh,
Gotta keep running
Gotta keep fleeing
Gotta keep hoping
There is something up there

When the bombs fall, we took our chance
We beat down the guards and ran to the fence
How many of my mates are already dead?

I see a glimmer of light on the horizon
Dawn's coming and all I see is meadows.
Thought I was safe, but a gun went astray
And it's fiery cough took my breath away

Oh,
Gotta keep running
Gotta keep fleeing
Gotta keep hoping
There is something up there
Escape... escape...
