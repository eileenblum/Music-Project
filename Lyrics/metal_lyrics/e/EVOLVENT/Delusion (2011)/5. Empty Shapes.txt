I stand beside the shades of my world
A light outside is spreading them away
I can't say why, I can't say how
Me and I took different ways

Empty shape weaved with absenses
Now out of the realm of senses

I feel like the mirror of my name
Habe been scattered into pieces
Unknown words letters became
In which I have unseen faces

Empty shape weaved with absenses
Now out of the realm of senses

I was born a tree so many years ago
Now I'm barely a whirl of dead leaves
Drifting on a blind river I go
Carried away, finding no relief

Empty shape weaved with absenses
Now out of the realm of senses

I will reborn or I will not
Cleansed of all I was taught
If a seed can bloom in nothingness
I'll be this child in a black dress

Have I been wrong, or is it fate?
The best answer seems to be silence
Deep inside only stays hate
Being torn apart was the experience

Empty shape weaved with absenses
Now out of the realm of senses
