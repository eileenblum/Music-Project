Here I stand, alone
In the heart of confusion
What have I done?
I've created delusion

What I wanted, what I had to do
Lighten the blindness, put some sparks into
I gave them words, I gave them clue
Thought their night would turn into a better blue

Oh I felt they were helpless
Oh I saw what pain it caused
Oh I knew my boldness
I tried to share the gold

And now the harm is done
I cannot break the curse
The cure was a poison
From bad it turned to worse

I have the bitter role
The one who tried and failed
Now they see me evil
On their cross I am nailed

I am nailed

I've created fire
Wanted to took them higher
I gave them power
To become their own masters

But the sword of speak
Cut their flimsy mind in two
They slowly became sick
A dark abyss they felt into

Sons of a sin they were
Turn light into dark was the fate
I thought hope stood somewhere
But I was wrong, and now it's too late

Here I stand, alone
In the heart of confusion
What have I done?
I've created illusion
