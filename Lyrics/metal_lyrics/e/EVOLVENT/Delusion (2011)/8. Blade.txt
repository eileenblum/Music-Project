I am cool and gray, I am sharp and still
I am the reason, I am your will
I am nestled in your hand
I am at your order, my friend
I am the reason, I am the meaning

I am the way you can unravel the spring
Welling up inside you, the anger and the rage
I know it all, just watch watt I became

You know I want it
You know I need it
Just one thrustand you will quench my thirst
You know I want it
You know I need it
You don't have to think, just go for it

I'm nothing but an object, hungry for purpose
But only you can give me one of those
I know you'll blame me when the deed is done

You are those hands that wave the blade
Without you I'm nothing, you know it well
Only your weakness makes me strong
Only afterwards, you'll know it was all wrong

You know I want it
You know I need it
But this is just what for I was built
You know I want it
You know I need it
You don't have to think, just go for it
