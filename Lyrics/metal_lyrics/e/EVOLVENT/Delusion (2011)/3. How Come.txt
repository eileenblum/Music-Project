There was a time where all was mine
A single glance for me to shine
A single word for me to light
Blessed I was, the path was right
How come?

Falling down in slow motion,
Going down, there's no option
Consumed by oblivion
Drowned into illusion

I didn't see it coming
Never even had a feeling
Fate fooled me and changed my deal
Flyin' around with Fortune's wheel
How come?

Falling down in slow motion,
Going down, there's no option
Consumed by oblivion
Drowned into passion
