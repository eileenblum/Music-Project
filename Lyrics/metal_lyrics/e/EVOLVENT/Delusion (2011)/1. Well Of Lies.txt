Beautiful face, dark eyes
You'll see what you need behind these smiles
And fall in love with a well of lies

In the air there is this melody
That gently flows with a fashion
My dear would you dance with me
And be seduced by illusions

Let me be what you've ever wished for
Perfect mate, my soul is your mirror
I'm subdued to make you whole
See how deep in me you'll fall

Beautiful face, dark eyes
You'll see what you need behind these smiles
And fall in love with a well of lies

At some point in your delight
The perfection will come to an end
Slowly will fade the king of heart
From heights to dirt will you descend

I know all of it for a long time
So I'll hate you before you hate me
When the time come for you to see
A kiss of death will be goodbye

Only yourself you'll find in me
Empty inside I am really
Nothing I give, for nothing I own
Your queen is wearing a fake crown
From this dream you will awake
To see loving me is a mistake

Beautiful face, dark eyes
You'll see what you need behind these smiles
And fall in love with a well of lies
