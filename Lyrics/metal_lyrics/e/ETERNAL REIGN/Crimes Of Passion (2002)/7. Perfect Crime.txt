Lyin' awake - can't fall asleep
Runnin' after me - the bloody creep
A vision - a movie in my mind
Killer in dreams - no peace to find
Rising fear - a cold shiver
My body starts to shake and quiver

It's haunting me - scaring the shit out of me
My life has spiraled into insanity

[Chorus:]
A thriller in my mind - life runs out of time
Murderer in dreams - it's a perfect crime

The phobia - hit me every night
Sanity slips away - this can't be right
A braindance no one else can see
I'm a shadow of the man I used to be

It's haunting me - scaring the shit out of me
My life has spiraled into insanity

[Chorus:]
A thriller in my mind - life runs out of time
Murderer in dreams - it's a perfect crime 4 times

I'm so alone... I need some help...
âCause I'm scared to the bone

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
A thriller in my mind - life runs out of time
Murderer in dreams - it's a perfect crime
