Darkest night surrounding me...
Feel like trapped in a prison cell
My mind's empty - nothing's left to say...
Somebody please get me out of this hell

I am bound in sadness - can't see the light of day
Who will stop all this madness,
Before my life goes astray

Just the same old situation -
Another day has passed away
Lost faith in any relation - that's why I sit and pray

I wanna tear down the walls
I've been built around myself
I wanna break the silence now,
Just before I go insane

[Chorus:]
Don't want to play this one-man-show
In my theatre of pain
Don't want to run the race alone
Through the desert far from home
Don't want to be a shipwrecked man
Got lost at sea

Each night I walk the streets alone -
Smilin' faces all around
Don't know what went wrong -
Peace of mind I haven't found
The wind that's growing strong,
It won't push me to the ground

I want to clear the wind and rain,
Set my eyes to the sun
I want to melt the ice around,
Before my soul gets frozen

[Chorus:]
Don't want to play this one-man-show
In my theatre of pain
Don't want to run the race alone
Through the desert far from home
Don't want to be a shipwrecked man
Got lost at sea

[Solo]

I want to clear the wind and rain,
Set my eyes to the sun
I want to melt the ice around... ice around

[Chorus]
