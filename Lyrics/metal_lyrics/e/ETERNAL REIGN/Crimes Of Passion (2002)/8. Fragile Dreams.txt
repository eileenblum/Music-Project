End of the day â I watch the crimson sunset
As daylight yields the dark of night
My inner thoughts will go on that secret journey
Where time gets lost and reason fail
I'm staring at the wall till I close my eyes for sleep
Hope I'll meet her again â
The princess of my dreams

She's so far away â
The world of ice â
The land of snow
And she shines brighter than a thousand suns
Gaze at her cold blue eyes â
Wanna kiss her icy lips
But still she's out of reach

[Chorus:]
To dream is my destiny,
The price to pay is high
The night is my only friend
And the stars up in the sky
She touched me with her eyes
Soft as an evening breeze
I wanna keep them in mind...
My own fragile dreams

Am I crazy â chasing a phantom of my mind
Is it just an imagination
I don't care â I have to walk this path alone
Ooh destination unknown

[Chorus:]
To dream is my destiny,
The price to pay is high
The night is my only friend
And the stars up in the sky
She's like a blanket on a cold winter's night
She fills my days with joy
Makes my life big and bright
She touched me with her eyes
Soft as an evening breeze
I wanna keep them in mind...
My own fragile dreams

Princess:
On a cold winter's night...
I'll be back to be your destiny

All day long
The thoughts are runninâ through my head
Can't wait to see her again â
Can't wait her to take me away

Till the end of my days,
I wanna keep my dreams alive...
Keep your dreams alive
Leave this world behind,
Gonna take my lonely road
Forever and ever
Til the end
