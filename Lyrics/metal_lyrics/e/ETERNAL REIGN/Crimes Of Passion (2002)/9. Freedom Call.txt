You... you climb on the hills
But you feel the hills are too high
On and on, you fall to the ground
As you try to reach for the sky

Are you just a piece in someone else's game
Are you just a number, are you just a name
You live inside a capsule, ooh you wanna break out
I watch you getting mad, I hear you scream and shout

The worries of your days
They keep you awake, you can't sleep at night
Pictures of life you have in your mind
You're trying so hard it never turns out right

There has to be something more
You gotta get down, down to the core
Stand up straight, come on... break out
Lose the chains... scream and shout

[Chorus:]
Come on, hear the freedom call,
Like a shot in the dark, an echo in the hall
Come on, it's my freedom call,
Lend me a hand, catch me before I fall
Just before I fall... catch me!

Every day of your life's just the same
Your energy fades away... it fades away
Force back the tears of frustration
On your way in search of salvation
The chapter's closed... make a brand new start

There has to be something more
You gotta get down, down to the core
Stand up straight... break out

[Chorus]
