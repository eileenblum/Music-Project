They gather together - watch out!
The troops of hate - take care - don't be late
Spreading out their ugly body of thought
Anger's their religion - fight's their destiny
I can't believe this stupid ideology
It's so strange, as if their minds are deranged
Their minds are so deranged

You don't make sense to me - can't you see
You never heard about equality - yeah yeah
You're no better than your enemy
No such thing called a superior race
Nothing special âbout the colour of your face
You gotta give your brother some space
We're all a part of the human race

Dregs of society... you don't make sense to me

History thaught âem nothing
Raging violence against minorities
Thought that was left behind in the last century
Upcoming evil - the snakes around
We have to grind them into the ground
Don't close your eyes - we have to face the truth

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Dregs of society, don't make no sense to me
Dregs of society, never heard about equality
Dregs of society, hate what they just can't be
Dregs of society, no better than your enemy
Hey, listen close... you're no better, than your enemy
