Think it over... Bury your pride... Think it over...
You gotta leave the past behind!

Here we are again - eye to eye, face to face
Leave the door, we walked through, closed behind us
This is the time to trace problem to it's source
No run for cover, just the two of us... alone

[Pre-chorus:]
You say: âNothing's gonna last forever!â
But I can't take it no more, take it no more

[Chorus:]
Come on, think it over, it's gotta be just face to face
You'll leave the past behind, if it's only face to face
Bury your pride and say Goodbye, let us talk right face to face
We got a long road ahead, if it's only face to face

I may be better off without it, though it's hard that way
We lost the key to our emotions in the dust of our days
The choice is yours to kick the door for a new beginning
It looks like now or never, to turn a bad thing into good

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
Come on, think it over, it's gotta be just face to face
Bury your pride and say Goodbye, let us talk right face to face
We got a long road ahead, if it's only face to face

Think it over... Bury your pride... Leave the past behind!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
