Sometimes our lives flow like a river
Searching for the sea
Sometimes weÂ´re like leaves
Dancing in the storms of autumn
Sometimes we feel like a flower
Reaching for the light of the sun
Sometimes weÂ´re like sheep without a shepard -
Lost in the desert

Have we lost our way - whereÂ´s the destination
Close your eyes - let your spirits fly

[Chorus]
Listen close - deep in your mind -
A hidden power called
Inner Strength
Follow the path - to the depth of your soul -
And you will find
Inner Strength

Sometimes lifeÂ´s like a call never getting an answer
Sometimes weÂ´re all like drifters looking for our way

And if youÂ´ve lost your way -
DonÂ´t know the destination
Close your eyes - let your spirits fly

[Chorus]

We are all travellers on a journey through time
Always wandering in this labyrinth... called life
What weÂ´ll find... itÂ´s in your mind

[Solo]

Like a river searching for the sea
Like a leaf dancing in the storm
Like a flower reaching for the sun
Like sheep without a shepard
Like a river searching for the sea
Like a leaf dancing in the storm
Like a call never getting an answer
Like a drifter looking for the way

[Chorus]
