Cast up in the burning skies, it's glowing fiery red
Somewhere so far away the journey lies ahead
So far we've come to nowhereland so far away we've flown
Lost in time in this tortured land so many miles away from home

I have lost the cool winds of heaven, lost the clear blue sky
Since the day I went away, left the early days aside
Gotta live free! Cast away the shadows!
Gotta leave the heathen way and walk the open road

So tired of being alive, my soul cries out in pain
Wash the dust from my face, wipe away the blood stain

[Chorus:]
Angels crying - souls are dying - on the forbidden path

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Angels crying - souls are dying - on the forbidden path

Fall down on my knees, praying for forgivness
Sins no longer overwhelming
Finally made my way back home

Blood and tears, pain and fear, lives in misery
Out on the killing fields, no one else but me
Hate and anger, pride and envy, killed my sanity
The licking flames of hell no longer reachin' me

[Chorus:]
Angels crying - souls are dying - on the forbidden path

The hellfires - the flames - don't get me - out on the forbidden path!
