Night falls in - shades flashing over the sidewalk
Emptiness freezes the soul to death
Step by step, shot by shot, life fades outta your body
The cries are in vain, they die away in pain

Life is slippin' - you lie as a slave at their feet
Freedom's gone by the chains of lies

Angel faces lie to you in the name of god
You waste your bucks for eternal peace
Hypocrites they talk and gonna blurr your mind
Their way to bliss is your road to ruin

They fill up your ears and they dazzle your eyes
They promise you glory and lead you to a church of lies

[Chorus:]
Don't you be a fool, don't get blinded by the light
Let your mind be your guide
Just be strong, the game they play is just a trick
Ce sont les rÃªves en plastique

On the TV you take a look in the face of war
What about our politicians - do they really care no more
It's a shame how children choking on a crust of bread
While in our western world, millionaires getting rich and fat

This is one world and it's enough for you and me
So why we create a second or third?

[Chorus:]

Make up your mind, don't be a fool
Playing their game and just be a believer
They gonna blind you and tell you lies
It's the mask of the great deciever

[Solo]

The fear... the lies... the hunger

[Chorus]
