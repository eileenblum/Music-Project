Take a look in the mirror, what do you see?
What makes you stare as if spellbound?
Such a sad sight, the fading glory
Could this be the end of the story? oh yeah
Shivers running down your spine, darkness shadows the light
No one to hear your desperate cries, you'll be paralyzed
All the would have beens, the could have beens
All waste away, fade to grey
Innocence dying in so many ways
Dreams of your life, lost in a haze
Shivers running down your spine, darkness shadows the light
No one to hear your desperate cries, you'll be paralyzed
Standing at the crossing, looking in the sky
Waiting for the stars to align the way

[Chorus:]
Light the light, hear the distant call
Terrified by this world of sorrow
Light the light, shoutin' out for dawn
In the night, praying for tomorrow

Secret hearts are beatin' fast, angry words they fall
Time and time the story's told, you will rise or fall
Falling tears collecting, in a shallow pool
Sacred eyes will see the reflecting fool

[Solo]

Time and time the dreams have gone
Who will light the light of dawn

Take a look in the mirror, what do you see?
What makes you stare as if spellbound?
Such a sad sight, the fading glory
Could this be the end of the story? oh yeah
Shivers running down your spine, darkness shadows the light
No one to hear your desperate cries, you'll be paralyzed
Standing at the crossing, looking in the sky
Waiting for the stars to align the way

[Chorus 3x]
