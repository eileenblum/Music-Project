A thousand times I trusted you - my Love
Let you into my world, no one else has seen before
Turned myself inside out for you - my Love
My fear, my hopes and my twisted state of mind, yeah
Took a look inside my soul - and now
Time's running out too fast, though I want to make it last

Maybe I always knew that this love's a betrayal
Maybe I always knew that my dreams will soon be broken

[Chorus:]
The world is tumbling, I'm losing ground as we change from day to night
Fading away - it feels so strange how we turn from black to white

[Solo]

Where's the truth, can't it be found - my Love
Alone by myself, memories floating the mind
Under dark and cloudy skies - so grey
Hope will save the day, I'm crying tears of pain - standing in the rain

I ask myself
What went wrong
I won't let it go
This love so strong

[Chorus:]
The world is tumbling, I'm losing ground as we change from day to night
Fading away - it feels so strange how we turn from black to white
