Ooh, Mother - I'm gonna leave and I won't return... I won't return
Ooh, Father - leave you behind in search for the course... to search what I learned

[Chorus:]
We set the sails leave for a distant shore...
Set the sails ooh yeah
We set the sails leave for a distant shore...
Gotta find direction
Gotta do just what I have to do
We set the sails leave for a distant shore... oh... oh...

Ooh, Mother - dry all your tears - I will return... I will return
Ooh, Father - to loose means to win, to search means to find a place so unkind

[Chorus:]

[Solo]

Ooh, Mother - we'll meet again on that different shore... on that distant shore
Ooh, Mother - to loose means to win... that's what I know, where should I go?

[Chorus till the end]
