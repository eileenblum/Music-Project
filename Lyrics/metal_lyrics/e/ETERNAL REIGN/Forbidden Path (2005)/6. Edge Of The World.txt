Hands are shaking, my body's aching, wild thoughts spinning through my head
Pressure's rising, my skin is tight, is this the beginning of the end
Heading towards the light at the end of the tunnel
No way out - I can't get off of this train - no way out!
"Seize the day" I heard them say, when I turned and walked away
I was blinded by paradise, now I'm drowned in my own dreams
Now I have to swollow this last bitter pill
No way out - the door is locked forever - no way out

[Chorus:]
Here I am, night and day will collide - I'm at the edge of the world
Here I am, alpha and omega unite - I'm at the edge of the world

Trembling - head is numb, as I try to speak
Feeling icy tears running down my cheek
Everything's so far away, while nothing seems fullfilled
Wishing to be strong, while the worst is gonna come

Heading towards the light at the end of the tunnel
No way out - I can't get off of this train - no way out!

[Chorus:]

Side by side with myself again, truth so hard to believe, feelin' deceived
Standing at the edge - at the edge - at the edge of the world

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
