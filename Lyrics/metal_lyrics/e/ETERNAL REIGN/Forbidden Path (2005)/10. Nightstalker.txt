It was an ancient time - on an eerie night - in a distant land
In my darkest hour I've been laid with a curse
I was trapped in this life - unsuspecting, innocent
Restless and wild - have to pay the prize

I gotta follow the call - in the moonlit night
Just around nightfall - you'll better hide

[Chorus:]
I'm comin' near - increasing fear - beware the nightstalker
No time to lose, or time to choose - don't let you steps falter

A slave to darkness - bound to the night
You'll never hear my feet nor ever see my shade
Mirror on the wall never shows my sight
An eternal walk is my tragic fate

I gotta follow the call - in the moonlit night
Just around nightfall - you'll better hide

[Chorus:]
I'm coming near - increasing fear - beware the nightstalker
No time to lose, or time to choose - don't let your steps falter

Wandering through the ages - my eyes never see the day
One bite will be contagious - would you dance with the wicked
In the midnight hour - do you dare to go
I will devour
Keep hold on to your crucifix
I'm out for a sacrifice

By the pale moonlight, wish I could be strong
Knowing the deeds I've done must be wrong
Down on my knees I pray to God above:
"Give me peace of mind and protect the things I love!"
There's an inner struggle with the beast inside
I'm led by the instinct - gonna lose this fight

[Chorus:]
I'm coming near - increasing fear - beware the nightstalker
No time to lose, or time to choose - don't let your steps falter
