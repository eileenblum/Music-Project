A darkened room, prayers go out like silent cries
I'm asking for truth, all that's offered are lies
Demons haunting my soul, laughing at me
I'm down in a hole, it's no desperate dream,
Can't break this spell, can't find the key

Screaming in the dark, sighing in the night
I'm begging for redemption
What life's all about
People all around me they keep on telling
You gotta crawl before you walk
You gotta cry before you talk
The wheels of time keep on rollin'
No magic mirror will erase
The lines of life carved deep in my face

[Pre-chorus:]
I opened the door step out in the drivin' rain
Hear footsteps close behind me
Into darkness I try to carry on
All of a sudden somebody called out my name

I'm crying out for angels
The ones that strucked me down
Left me lying in the rain
Left me alone in pain
I'm swimmin' 'gainst the tide
Life's river gonna drown me
Gotta sail on stormy waters
'til my soul will find it's peace

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
My tortured soul in endless time
I'm ready to take a chance
At the crossroad I'll make my stand
Life's in my own hands

I'm crying out for angels...

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Take my chance - take this life - make my stand
