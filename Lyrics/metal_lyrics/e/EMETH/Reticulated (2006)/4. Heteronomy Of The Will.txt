Apathetic affection declared
Imminent secular behavior
Through an uninterrupted
Management of instinctual needs
An obligation to acknowledge
That the essence of enlightenment
Is a efficient subversion of the
Conditions of liberation
Effectuate the heteronomy
The superiority concept illustrious
Displays the adorated
Prostration and subjection
Transfigured and idealized
An absence as to be transcended
Designates its eradication
So that the "righteousness"
Might be fulfilled
Effectuate the heteronomy
Cast out thine eye and thou
Shalt come as sheep
Gather your thorns for by their
Fruits ye shall know them
Cast out thine eye and thou
Shalt come as sheep
Gather your thorns for by their
Fruits ye shall know them
Cast out thine eye and thou
Shalt come as feeble sheep
