Mutating archaic paradigms
Create a meaningless cosmos which is
An expression of the inability
Of the mind to correlate it's contents
Sequential experience
And behavioral principles
Are equivalent in their
Attainments of enlightenment
Question all affectional
Constructs while refusing
The comforting confines
Of the present suffering
Chaos manipulates
Discordance controls
Confusion restores
Synthesis reverts to chaos
The confronting polarities
Between realism and reason reflect a
Deconstruction which mirrors
A reconstruction of an
Abstract knowledge
From awareness of opposition
Towards resolution on
The origins of the present
Suffering from satisfaction
