Subjective sensations express the transcient
Relationship between the secure
Foundations of convention
And the non-visual patterns
Unavailable to the senses
The antagonistic dependency
Defines the perceptive
Limitations extending from
The absolute threshold
Which is the recurrent
Dominance of the basic urges
The objective perception of
The differences
Depends on the essence
Which advocates deception
The incoherent perception
Of the differences
Depends on the synopsis which
Advocates deception
The consciousness of the
Continuity of existence
Consolingly established the
Belief that it's relevance
Is unquestioned it's relevance
Is ever unquestioned
This biomechanical source
Accomplished the
Omnipresent illusion
The consciousness of the
Continuity of existence
Consolingly established
The belief that it's
Relevance is unquestioned
It's relevance is ever
Unquestioned
