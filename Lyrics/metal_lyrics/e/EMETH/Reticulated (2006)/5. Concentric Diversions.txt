The phenomena of self-deception
And deficiency are intransigent
Justified through the
Determination of existence
The prevalent metaphysical disposition
Of a self obstructs the explanation
Of consequences of
Decisions in retrospect
Unmotivated projections manipulate
The fundamental constants
And dissolve into complex
Evolutionary individual experiences
The reduction to a convergence
Of thought constructions
Is in contradiction with the
Presupposition of individuality
The esoteric is diverted into the
Exoteric defined by
Patterns of perception
Which are emblematic
Of the conception
The origin of enhancement
And the necessary condition
To comprehend the impermanence
Of existential elements
To amplify the idea of a
Complete non-existence
Becomes irrelevant to
Avoid confrontation
