There rose up an impure soul of filth and of weakness 
and it corrupted all of ye men 
The Coming of the King and Judge of this corrupted world 
Kneel before Him or be cast down 
Every one of you is blind 
Yet ye shall see things as they are! 
Every one of you is deaf 
Yet ye shall hear things as they are! 
For I lift the mask of matter 
I open the hearts of all men 
For I am of force to shatter 
The cast that hideth the vision 
Here and now shall it be accomplished 
Revealing the truth to the uninitiated 
The blind will see your flesh pierced 
The deaf will hear your wounds bleed 
I have slain all things 
I am Innocence 
Iâve given birth to all things 
I am Death 
For the light of the Sun maketh illusion 
Blinding man's eyes to the glory of the stars 
And unless he be in the shadow of the earth 
He cannot see that I am that which is beyond 
I laugh at the folly of the few for I am the One 
Know thyself, and knowing thyself 
You will know the Divine!
