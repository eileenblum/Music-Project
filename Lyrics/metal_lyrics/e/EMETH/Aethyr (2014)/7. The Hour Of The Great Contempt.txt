The great despiser is the great adorer 
An arrow of longing for the other shore 
His soul is filled with fire and burning coals! 
They herald the coming of lightning and madness 
All that is poverty, filth and wretched contentment. 
Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? 
Where is the madness with which you should be cleansed? 
Once a man has achieved 
The hour of the great contempt 
He becomes truly free to do as he wills 
Plunging into the very depths 
He consequently rises above the world 
He is that lightning, he is that madness! 
Who had been lost now conquers all 
Those who speak of otherworldly hopes 
Poisoners of life are they 
Decaying and poisoned themselves 
Of whom the earth is weary: away with them! 
The great despiser is the great adorer 
And arrow of longing for the other shore 
His soul is deep; even in the wounding 
And may perish through a small matter 
Thus he goes willingly over the bridge 
Man is just a bridge and not a goal 
He who justifies the future ones 
And redeems the past ones 
He is willing to perish through the present ones!
