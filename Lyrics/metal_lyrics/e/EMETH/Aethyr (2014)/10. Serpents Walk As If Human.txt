I died not to spare, but that the world may perish 
The venom of my fang is the inheritance of my father 
They that drink thereof are to be smitten of disease 
Now shall I give it unto thee - through my blood 
Let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers 
In their ecstatic laughter I hear their volition towards salvation 
From the abomination that I hath hold upon them 
âBlessed are the poor in spirit: 
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Take my body upon you, and devour it; 
For I am meek and lowly in heart: 
And ye shall find filth unto your souls. 
For my lie is easy, and itâs burden is deathâ 
I know what burns their hearts 
I shall show them mine own 
In the end they will lay at my feet 
And say to me: Make us your slaves! 
I died not to spare, but that the world may perish. 
The abomination that I hath hold upon them 
How shall it be made the end of things
