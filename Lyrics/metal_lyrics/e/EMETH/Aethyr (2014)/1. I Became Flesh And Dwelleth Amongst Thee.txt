The Divine Birth of the Dying and Resurrected God 
Apostasy breathed life into the sterile universe 
The Epiphany that appears among men like a storm 
An end to the servile virtues and restrictions 
Through the fury of the storm! 
Deathly quiet pandemonium! 
The revelation of the god who has become a man 
Bursting forth from the darkness in the form of a savage 
With one hand he brings ecstasy and deliverance 
And with the other hand wildness and rage 
Through the fury of the storm! 
Deathly quiet pandemonium! 
Fire in nature, Love in spirit 
They that know me shall recognize 
Wine for blood and crowned with horns 
The Master of the World serves to None 
Snake of the Hundred Heads! 
On the earth 
A kingdom of black to the blind 
Lion of the Burning Flame! 
The light of adorations is mine 
Its rays consume me 
Through the fury of the storm!
