O thou that art so dull of understanding, 
For all that thou thinkest is but thy thought 
And as there is no god in the ultimate shrine 
So there is no I in thine own Cosmos. 
The Vision to be revealed 
The Voice to be heared 
The Vision of the Aethyr appeareth when the true mind above the abyss 
Looks down into the world of delusion then there is knowledge 
My eyes are brighter than the sun 
My tongue is swifter than the lightning 
The Voice of the Aethyr echoeth when the deluded mind in the abyss 
Peer upwards from the depths of madness then there is knowledge 
For thou wilt find a life which is as Death 
A Death which should be infinite 
Let the Sons of Earth keep silence 
For my Name is become as That of Death! 
The paradox of our non-essentiality the mutability of our existence 
The rapture of our progress through the wastelands of restriction 
My body is the body of the Snake 
My soul is the soul of the Crowned Child 
My eyes are brighter than the sun 
My tongue is swifter than the lightning 
The great Serpent arisen into Knowledge 
When wilt thou begin to annihilate thyself in the mysteries of the Aethyrs? 
And walk with me among the Sons of God
