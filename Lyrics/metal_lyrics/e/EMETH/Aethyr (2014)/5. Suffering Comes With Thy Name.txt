Suffering is a gift of the higher 
To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity 
The earth will disclose the blood shed on it 
And will no longer cover its slain 
How manifold are your works? 
In wisdom you cursed them all 
Sick creeping things innumerable 
The earth is full of your failures 
Like a Hawk I peck at the eyes 
My wings in the face blind him 
With my claws I tear out the flesh 
I spit on your crapulous creeds 
I give unimaginable joys on earth 
Certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; ecstasy 
Nor do I demand aught in sacrifice 
Those who enslave themselves to the undead 
Will be banished when the Sun shall fully rise 
Only when theyâre all gone can we truly become as 
"A strong Man who goeth forth to do his Will" 
The Equinox of the Gods has come as it does every two thousand years 
Sweeping away the darkness of the old ways 
Where once blazed the Cross of Suffering 
As the Sun of Beauty now there is the Crowned and Conquering Child 
Whose message is âGrace from Withinâ 
The Kingdom of strength that is within you 
The dreams through fire, The visions of intellect 
The child of thy bowels, He shall behold them
