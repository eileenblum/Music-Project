Manifold are false and perverted dogmas 
Monstrous Parasites and Vermin they are 
Enemies without Pity, destructive to free will 
Adherent to thee by vice of heredity 
Eidolons of Ash conceal the secret of Self 
To find salvation they allure the meek 
With the reward of heaven and eternity 
And those who adore not will be damned forever 
If ever there is a loss to mourn, it is the loss of Self 
Envy is ignorance; and imitation is suicide 
The tragedy is within the immolated mind 
Ignorant slaves to destructive temptations 
Eidolons of Ash destroy manâs virtues 
Trenchantly accusing and embittering men 
Herd instinct is the end of the Individual 
Destroy the Traitors Of Will to Power 
Destroy the Traitors Of Power to Will 
Do thou with all thy Might 
Strive against these Forces 
For they resist that which is Life 
And thus they areâ¦ 
They are of Death 
Earth, a kingdom of black to the blind 
Drenched with blood, slavery and damnation 
Who are of us shall know and destroy...
