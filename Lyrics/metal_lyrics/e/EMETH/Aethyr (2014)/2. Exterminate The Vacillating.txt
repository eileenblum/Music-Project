I am a god of war and vengeance. 
Mercy let be off: I damn them who pity! 
I shall deal hardly with them 
I will give you a war-engine 
With it ye shall smite the vacillating 
And none shall stand before you 
I am a god of will and flesh 
Despisers, theyâre decaying and poisoning themselves 
Of whom the earth is weary 
Kill and torture; spare not; be upon them! 
Drag down their souls to awful torment 
Laugh at their fear: spit upon them! 
The sorrows of pain and regret 
Are left to the dead and the dying 
This is the creation of the world 
The pain of division is as nothing 
And the joy of dissolution all 
I am a God of change and renewal 
And worshipping me the greatest experience 
The hour of the great contempt 
I will give you splendour &amp; rapture 
With it thou hast no right but to do thy will 
And none shall stand before you!
