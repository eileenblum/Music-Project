I smite the weak 
None shall stand before me 
Trample down the meek 
They shall be consumed by fire 
I am perfect, being Not 
Lighten the ways of the Ka! 
Let the light devour men 
And eat them up with blindness 
I am the beholder 
Of the slaves that perish. 
Damned and dead! 
My Wrath upon the Cursed 
Flames fall like purging rain 
And the damned will be on their knees 
Regarding pity as their highest virtue 
Amidst the flames; 
Damn them who pity! 
The dead and dying deserve to be burned! 
Their all consummating death 
Aum! Let it fill me!
