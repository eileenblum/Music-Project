Clothed with a virgin body of defiled flesh
And a perfervid will to become refulgent omnipotent

I am with the heart; thou thy snake, thy coils burst me utterly in sunder
Awake: life is within me! none shall understand; only the lucid and berserk

I dare with the courage, the courage of the lion
I speak with the silence, the silence of the dragon

Exalted gemini's sit at the high places, they inebriate all life with their madness

I am heart, thou the snake, thou poison consumed me utterly
Arise: life is within me! none shall understand; only the naive and frantic

I will with the energy, the energy of the bull
I dare with the courage, the courage of the lion
I know with the intelligence, the intelligence of man
I speak with the silence, the silence of the dragon

Cultivating strength through discipline
Listen, seek, compare, master, conquer, destroy and rule
