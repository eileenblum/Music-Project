The lucidity prior to the manifestation of being, existence and nothingness
The onset of incoherent thoughts illuminates the journey towards emptiness

The madness in the sanity and the sanity in the madness

Blinding darkness-for those who follow ignorance
Deafening darkness-for those who follow knowledge
Whoever knows the unity overcomes death through ignorance
And obtains immortality through knowledge

Move through the spheres, where nothing can be divided
Where one is both one and two, a complete withdrawal

What sorrow can there be for he who beholds and enters the manifested oneness?

Blinding darkness-for those who follow non becoming
Deafening darkness-for those who follow becoming
Whoever knows the unity overcomes death through destruction
And obtains immortality through becoming

The madness in the sanity and the sanity in the madness
The ultimate overcoming-the overcoming of man
