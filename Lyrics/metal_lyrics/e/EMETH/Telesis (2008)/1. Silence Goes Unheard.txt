The universe is in equilibrium therefore he that wills
Though his force be but a feather can overturn the universe

Unless thou hearest not, thou canst not see
Unless thou seest not, thou canst not hear

This harmony of the universe unites the will to exist
with the understanding of perfection: understand thou thine own will

Black to the blind and blue and gold to the seeing
Through the abyss we rise to illuminate ourselves

Unless thou hearest not, thou canst not see
Unless thou seest not, thou canst not hear
Ye are not seeing! Ye are not hearing!
Ye shall be as ye are and not other; be thyself

There is a silence in my universe of exquisite magnitude
The strength of my thoughts shall be the beauty of it's splendorous glory
