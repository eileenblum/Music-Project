All our lives we hear a call
And it comes from our blood
Bastard blood from beyond
Remains in us and make us wolves

In our eyes the fire burns
We choose to live in  the under ground
Doesn't matter what they done
Only death will judge to us

They say i live in sin
That the evil is inside of me
I have broke your divine law
lust, perversion, cruelty.
should i suppress my dark instinct?
And forget my human desires?
I say no! you fuck off!!!
your stupid falth is not four us

We are the legacy
Warriors of an extinct breed
The old empire is returning

Counfless of our cultures razed
With blood and sword evangelized
politic and money talks
We are part of the legion of dead

Rifuals our ancestors created
Under the black mysterious night
Now is raise the power from depths
To bring back the ancient death

We are the legacy
Warriors of an extinct breed
The old empire is returning

Infernal warrior attack with their swords
To reconquer our old world
Torture, muder, bastard gods
Heretic witches demand blood
We are strong, worthy and proud
vengeance call for destruction
Thousand years os submissions
The glorious victory now is us!!
