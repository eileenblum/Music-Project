Old Spirits into ages travel reincarnating
In my mind have its roots and I can't take out
I hear the sound of thousand screams

Death in my is driving me crazy
Eating my infection turn me into darkness
Like the howl of ancient souls

Creating a mounster
Coming from the hell
Reincarnated evil 

Damned intruder controlling my feelings
Hungry leech pull the strings of all my life
How could I escape to reality?

Now I'm possessed by tormented souls
Controlling me as a putrid dead corpse
What is it searching with all this?

Creating a mounster
Coming from the hell
Reincarnated evil 

I will never be me again
Exiled of my own life
From another world a portal 

It drown me deep in its dark axistence
Memories and cisions of horror and death
Always appears intro my mind

Now we are a creature with the same flash
Follow your destroy and blood craving
All as before and over will be

Creating a mounster
Coming from the hell
Reincarnated evil
