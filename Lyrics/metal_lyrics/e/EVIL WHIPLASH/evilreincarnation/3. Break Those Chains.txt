Anger invades my mind when I see it
I can't believe their arrogance and vanity
Old lust in draagging below their holy cassocks
Shielded forever for an stupid ancient tale.

free your life, from those chains
many lives, lost in vain

Following blindly other steps they were ensiaved
Open your eyes and see the fruth in your face.

Madness, Repression, Betrayal, Hypocrisy.

Using your fear to death as their weapon
selling to you a fruth that is not so frue
Forbidding all the things that makes you human
But all the damage they done is a boty sin.

Knowledge hidden behind the vell of greed
Give us the force to destroy all that fucking lies
Lives and cultures devasted by this plague
But the falling of that wall of lies is near!!!

Free your life, from those chains
Many lives, lost in vain

Following blindly other steps they were enslaved
Open your eyes and see the in your face.

Madness, Repression, Betrayal, Hypocrisy.
