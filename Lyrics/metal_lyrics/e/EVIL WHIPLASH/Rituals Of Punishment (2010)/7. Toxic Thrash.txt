[Julian Ruiz]

Satan show it's ready now
Metal maniacs come tonight
Leather, rivets, clothes in black
Waiting all just for our band

Alcohol, sex and drugs
Thrashers rules tonight
Into your moshpit round
We gonna burn your soul

Destruction rays, released from hell
Infected sound, rot in your soul

[Chorus:]
This nuclear blast, into your mind
Lethal attack, the thrash is back!!Â 

Fire burns inside my brain
Is the sound of the death?
Bestial chants from the hell

Bang my head like a mad
Raise your fist to the band
Heavy thrash tonight is the law...

Toxic thrash, toxic thrash
Toxic thrash, toxic thrash

[Chorus]

When we finish our work here
Move our madness to next town
Infecting young minds all around
Our damned army follow us

Alcohol, sex and drugsÂ 
Thrashers rules tonight
Into your moshpit round
We gonna burn your soul

[Chorus]

Fire burns inside my brain
Is the sound of the death?
Bestial chants from the hell

Bang my head like a mad
Raise your fist to the band
Evil whiplash plays tonight

Toxic thrash, Toxic thrash
Toxic thrash, Toxic thrash
