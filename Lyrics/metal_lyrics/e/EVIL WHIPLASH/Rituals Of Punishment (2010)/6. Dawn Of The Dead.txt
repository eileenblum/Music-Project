[Julian Ruiz]

A smell of death is in the winds tonight
The moon is covered by dark clouds in the sky
Desperate screams heard into the shadows
Blood, guts and brains lying on the dust

Midnight, the souls from the hell was raising
At cemetery, graves moving and coffins breaking
In the fog, you hear a malignant spell
He has decided to wake up the dead

To form his evil army now
Of hungry zombies wishing to kill
Walk in the streets the dead again
Searching revenge for his master

Horror, hell, dawn of the dead
Horror, hell, dawn of the dead

In the shadows, slowly is dragging death
In his dead eyes, is burning the hell
What is this nightmare that I live?
Please take me away of this lunacy

But this is real, and I will die
Hide and scare, waiting for them
But they will find me, I know
And then I'll see the face of pain

A smell of death is in the winds tonight
The moon is covered by dark clouds in the sky
Desperate screams heard into the shadows
Blood, guts and brains lying on the dust

Rotten dead hunting, looking for your blood
Nobody will see day never more
The slaughter and torture it's horrible
They caught you in bed and eat all your guts

Devour it all, nobody lives
Their screams are heard into your mind
It sounds like echo when you're dying
Now in the hell you're one of them

Horror, hell, dawn of the dead
Horror, hell, dawn of the dead

When all is dead return to their graves
Begging for peace and have a rest
But there is just pain for the damned souls
They'll lift again whenever he wants

Killing to all, damage it's done
No where to run, they already come
At last he made that always said
Return the dead to take revenge

Horror, hell, dawn of the dead
Horror, hell, dawn of the dead
Horror, hell, dawn of the dead
Horror, hell, dawn of the dead...
