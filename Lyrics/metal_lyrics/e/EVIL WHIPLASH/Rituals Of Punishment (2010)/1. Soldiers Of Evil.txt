[Julian Ruiz]

Tonight we are going to destroy, and to invoke the lord of depths
Burn the false churches, and sow the sin into your lives,

In this dark and cold night, Satanic rituals from the hell,
Destroy the world as we know it, reign the world under the sign of evil,

We warn to you,
Are with us or against to us

Choose to run away or fight,
But if you try to flee

I promise, to hunt you as a rat,
I'll remove your brain of a hack.

Your soul to my shades enslaved
Torment without end

[Solo]

Soldiers of evil, burn all the altars ...
Soldiers of evil, with violence to kill....
Soldiers of evil, sacrifice the bastards ...
Soldiers of evil, release the hell beast...

All those who stay to fight with us, find victory and destroy their slavery chains,
Will be free to think and act, without fear, in the Satan's reign.

New world of blood and fire, eternal night lit by fire of hell
Kill at night, enjoy the fire, drink angel's blood, nothing it's denied

Soldiers of hell, burn all the altars ...
Soldiers of evil, with violence to kill ....
Soldiers of hell, sacrifice the bastards ...
Soldiers of evil, release the hell beast...
