[Julian Ruiz]

Tears of hate falling from my face
Living in shadows my anger grows
My heart had turns a stone of ice
Your love for them it's a waste

All my suffer, you will pay
Like I hate you, they'll love me
You'll see all they, praying for me
Your sick game, I'll finish with hell fire

I hate you, I hate them
I'll kill you, I'll kill them
Fake god, I destroy you
I'll put you, into my hell

Torture and agony
See them die
Horror and hell
Hear their cry
Vengeance and death
You will pay
Heaven and earth
Burned by fire

[Solo]

All the indifference and refuse
You'll pay me with their blood
Waiting in dark until my revenge
Never my pride fall before you

Burning down all your creation.
You'll see the ruins of earth
I'll bring death, pain, desperation
Arise from fire for my revenge

I hate you, I hate them
I'll kill you, I'll kill them
Fake god, I destroy you
I'll put you, into my hell

I hate you, I hate them
I'll kill you, I'll kill them
