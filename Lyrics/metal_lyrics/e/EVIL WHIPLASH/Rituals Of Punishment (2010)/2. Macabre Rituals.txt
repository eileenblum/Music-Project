[Julian Ruiz]

I have this feel
Loneliness fills my life

I have the need
Of company at any cost

Even if I must
Take you out of your grave
Skinning you
And use your skin like a dress

In this black night
I can found my refuge

I can be again
A master of my bloody puppets

I only want
Find relief with the dead
Trying to return
My darling girl from the hell

A stink of dead
A putrid body in the place

Its just the smell
Of lust from a twisted brain

Oh powerful death
Bring me the peace and calm
The courage to do this
Returns to me what I've seek

Blood, skulls, deads
Only I need this
Blood, skulls, deads
Only I want this
Blood, skulls, deads
Only desire this
Blood, skulls, deads
Only I have this

Hide in the shadows
Searching more victims
For the macabre ritual
Of the human skin masks

Blood, skulls, deads
Only I need this
Blood, skulls, deads
Only I want this
Blood, skulls, deads
Only desire this
Blood, skulls, deads...
Only I have this
