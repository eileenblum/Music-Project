[Julian Ruiz]

Black leather army
Come back to city
To kill that fools

With eyes in flames
The hands like hammers
To crush your heads

They ride by nights
Searching for victims
No one can't stop them

With hell's razors
Scratch your face
And cut your throat

Rivers of putrid dead blood
Screams of pain I can hear
Exterminate all that fools
They will be rotten in hell

Anti poser patrol
Anti poser patrol
Anti poser patrol
Anti poser patrol

[Solo]

They come from hell
You can't escape
You'll die by demons

If you're a fake maniac
They come for you
They show no mercy

Whit swords of fire
Behead that posers
And drink their blood

Soldiers of evil
Behind your necks
Your death its near

Rivers of putrid dead blood
Screams of pain I can hear
Exterminate all that fools
They will be rotten in hell

Anti poser patrol
Anti poser patrol
Anti poser patrol
Anti poser patrol
