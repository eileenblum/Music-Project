[Julian Ruiz]

In the darkness demons come
I can hear the screams of hate
But don't scare me never more
Because I'm in his army now

All the people running away
Trying to escape of this fate
So much horror must expect
Cause from death no one escapes

Ghost riders in the sky
Death ripping in the dark
Souls screaming in the earth
Legions in command of Satan

Evil souls walk again
Drink your blood, eat your flesh
Sunlight never seen in earth
Blackened world it's under Satan

Apocalypse's roaring loud
The blood of people is all around
Rotten corpses are impaled
Take control the king of hell

For Satan's power you will die
And your soul will burn in hell
With violent force take his revenge
It's time to rise and rules the earth

[Solo]

Ghost riders in the sky
Death ripping in the dark
Souls screaming in the earth
Legions in command of Satan

Evil souls walks again
Drink your blood, eat your flesh
Sunlight never seen in earth
Blackened world is under Satan

Arise from endless shadows
It's my time to control the earth
A new age of fire and darkness
Only my servants remainâ¦

Arise!!!
