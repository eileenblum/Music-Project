[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt &amp; O. Baumann]

The morning sun awakes the night
A touch of light blesses the sleeping ones
Once thereâve been a golden place
A monument for human race

I stood alone when morning came
They came to take away all life
They promised that weâre free at last
And turned this place into a grave

The night returns, day by day
A night of suffering
Thereâs no way out, no lightened way
Captured in a cage

They call their home, âHome of the Braveâ
They praise their land, âLand of the Freeâ
Theyâre destined to enslave all man
Until one day their system fails 

The night returns, day by day
A night of suffering
Thereâs no way out, no lightened way
Captured in a cage

The night returns, day by day
A night of suffering
Thereâs no way out, no lightened way
Captured in a cage
