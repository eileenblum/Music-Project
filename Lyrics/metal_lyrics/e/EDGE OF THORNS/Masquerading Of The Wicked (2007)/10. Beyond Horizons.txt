[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

Redeem me, release me
From the children of the night
Theyâre crawling, theyâre calling me
In a mental fight
I saw the light hid by the dawn
A miraculous one
If it fulfills my wish
Iâll forever gone

I want to live beyond deepest horizons
An unknown place where life never ends

Redeem me, release me
From the children of the night
Theyâre crawling, theyâre calling me
In a mental fight
I saw the light hid by the dawn
A miraculous one
If it fulfills my wish
Iâll forever gone

I want to live beyond deepest horizons
An unknown place where life never ends

I want to live beyond deepest horizons
An unknown place where life never ends
