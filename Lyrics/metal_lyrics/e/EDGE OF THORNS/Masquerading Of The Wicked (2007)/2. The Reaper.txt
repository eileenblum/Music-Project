[Music: Brixius &amp; Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

Down, down, down, you feel so down
Your time is over
Years passed by, youâre wondering why
Why you grew older

In the end
The reaper takes us all
A killing kind of hope
A killing kind of sorrow

Pray, just pray, my friend
The reaperâs gonna get you
You canât run away
Just stay and say âgood-byeâ
With a smile today

In the end
The reaper takes us all
A killing kind of hope
A killing kind of sorrow

Tell me itâs not true
Tell me itâs not true
A liar, a trickster, a killing crew
A villain, a sinner will never see the blue
Never!

In the end
The reaper takes us all
A killing kind of hope
A killing kind of sorrow
