[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

You smashed my heart to pieces
My heart that bled for you
Youâve found another soul
Your feelings were son untrue
Years after year I lived
With that sorrow in my neck
Now you crawl to me again
But thereâs turning back

Come a little bit closer now
And feel my pan
Our love wonât rise again
Not again

You tried to kiss me
Tried to touch me
Tried to make me feel
But time healed my wounds
My feelings turned to steel
Iâm not a puppet on a string
No more tears I cry
I hope for every single lie
A thousand times youâre gonna die 

Come a little bit closer now
And feel my pan
Our love wonât rise again
Not again

Come a little bit closer now
And feel my pan
Our love wonât rise again
Not again
Not again â Not again
Not again
