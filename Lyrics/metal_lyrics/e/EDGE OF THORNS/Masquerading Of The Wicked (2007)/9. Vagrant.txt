[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

We are one forever
Staying strong together
We are living on
The edge of thorns
Our love is never ending
Youâre the living dream of my yearnings
For you I was made to be

Our youth is never ending
Our lifeâs forever in our hands
I tell you we are never aging
We will always be vagrant

Ray of hope, ray of hope, of my lifetime
Our feelings are never ending
Combine with me and we fly to the eternal bay
Ray of hope, ray of hope, of my lifetime
Not even death can share us
We will live forever free

Our youth is never ending
Our lifeâs forever in our hands
I tell you we are never aging
We will always be vagrant
Through space and time weâre flying
Our lifeâs forever in our hands
Our dreams are never dying
We will always be vagrant

Our youth is never ending
Our lifeâs forever in our hands
I tell you we are never aging
We will always be vagrant

We stay together in a vanishing light
Holding us deep, holding us tight
We donât believe in the end of our dream
