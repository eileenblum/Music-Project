[Music: Brixius &amp; Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

Falling inside infinity
Beyond space and time
Beyond every idea
Raging through the endless
Universe of death

Screaming but youâre not heard
Confused, alone, speechless, fearful
Worshipped by stars and coldness
On a journey to the end

Enjoy your life
Death can wait
Live your dreams
Itâs not too late
Chase away the night by the day
Walk your own way
