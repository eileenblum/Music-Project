[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

Touch the rainbow
Touch the rainbow
My fallen brother
My fallen brother
My spirit is always on your way

Youâre in a place now
Youâre in a place now
Inside infinity
Infinity
But all your voices will be heard
Desperation, destination, lies

Remember, remember
You didnât live in vain, oh
You were the bringer of the golden age
We say forever, forever
Weâre standing all together
United we are fighting for the golden age

We mourned many nights
Our thoughts seemed so unclear
Shrouded in a mist of darkness
Our lifeâs filled up with fear
Only freedom gives us power
And if they donât agree
We will fight until the end
Because our souls are not for free

Remember, remember
You didnât live in vain, oh
You were the bringer of the golden age
We say forever, forever
Weâre standing all together
United we are fighting for the golden age
