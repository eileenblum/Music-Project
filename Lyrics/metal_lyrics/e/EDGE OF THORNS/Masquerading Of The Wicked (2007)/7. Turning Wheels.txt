[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt &amp; O. Baumann]

Burning down the highway
Riding like the wind
The motorbreath right under me
There is no place where I wanna stay
Rocklands is where Iâm gonna die

Fuel, steam, exhaust and heat
Adrenalin is what I need
Speed, dolls, beer and Rock ânâ Roll
Like a hungry wolf I howl
My heart explodes inside a fiery rain
When Iâm back on the streets
When Iâm riding again

Turning wheels
We burn the night away
Turning wheels
We turn the night into day
We rock

My wheels are turning on and on
They give me power, make me strong
Thereâs no place I wanna stay
Freedom is my prey
My heart explodes inside a fiery rain
When Iâm back on the streets
When Iâm riding again

Turning wheels
We burn the night away
Turning wheels
We turn the night into day
We rock
Turning wheels
We burn the night away
Turning wheels
We turn the night into day
We rock
