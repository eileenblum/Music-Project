[Music: Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

Deep dark eyes from hell
It is just the devil in disguise whoâs coming closer
Heâs gonna wash your dreams away
And turns your thoughts in deepest grey

Watch out! Watch out!
Watch always behind you
Itâs the masquerading of the wicked

Illusions of a perfect world
That man control seems so absurd
Why canât we live as one?
Donât be a slave
Donât shovel your own grave
Raise your voice
Nothing is gone

Watch out! Watch out!
Watch always behind you
Itâs the masquerading of the wicked

Embrace the truth inside of you
Tell what must be told
Struggle for humanity
If not! Youâre damned to live deep down in hell

Imprisoned or free
Your thoughts are your property
Make your choice now and you will see
The devil is a loser
Youâre stronger than heâll ever be

Watch out! Watch out!
Watch always behind you
Itâs the masquerading of the wicked

Watch out! Watch out!
Watch always behind you
Itâs the masquerading of the wicked
