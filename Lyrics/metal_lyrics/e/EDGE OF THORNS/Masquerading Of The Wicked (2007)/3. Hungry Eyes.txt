[Music: Brixius &amp; Edge of Thorns]
[Lyrics: D. Schmitt]

Misery is torturing me
Moulded to create a new world
Hypocritical is what I am
A killing machine made by man
Now darkness is calling me
Driving me into insanity
The sunlight Iâll never see again
Iâm made to die by my own hand

Hungry eyes
The wolves will take you all
Tonight youâre gonna fall
Youâre bleeding

Always had a vision
Of a world so peaceful and free
But my mind wasnât strong enough
Now I bleed
Captures in a cage
Feeded day by day with rage
Changes destroy my soul
Please, break the dawn away

Hungry eyes
The wolves will take you all
Tonight youâre gonna fall
Youâre bleeding

Hungry eyes
The wolves will take you all
Tonight youâre gonna fall
Youâre bleeding
