[music by En Declin - lyrics by Maurizio Tavani]

To Know Because I Was Born And Discover Every Border
To Cover Every Place Maybe It Could Be Enough
I Still Succeed To Remembering Where My Soul Sleeps
Buried From The Earth Enclosed In My Space Maybe It Could Be Enough To Me
I'll Travel With Your Eyes And I'll Discover To The Colours Of The World
Without Never To Forget, Maybe I Am Alone But I'm Not Still Defeated
I Have Tried To Look Beyond Appearances But I Was Blind I Could Not See
I Have Tried To Understand If It Still Serves To Wait For
I Have Followed Your Voice Until Bleeding
If I Could I Would Do It But I Can't Think Any Longer
I'll Travel With Your Eyes And I'll Discover To The Colours Of The World
Without Never To Forget, Maybe I Am Alone But I'm Not Still Defeated
