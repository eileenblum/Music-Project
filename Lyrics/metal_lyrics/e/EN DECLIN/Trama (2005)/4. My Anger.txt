[music by En Declin - lyrics by Maurizio Tavani]

I Would Like To Shoot My Anger Kill My Thoughts And Be Born Again
I Would Like To Believe Without Seeing Blood Pulses Strongly And Goes Up Within Me
Where Is The Moment You'll Amaze Me And Speak To Me
Now You Know My Weaknesses You Can't Be Wrong Any More
You Are A Bright Blade And Cleave My Body Close Your Eyes And Consume My Love
I'm Still Strong And Can Defend Myself Tonight I Won't Come Back Home I Still Want To Think
