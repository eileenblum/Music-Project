[music by En Declin - lyrics by Maurizio Tavani]

Drawing Near The Afternoon The Stepmother Welcomed, And I Felt You Were Among The Others
Yes, My Eyes Remind, But Never Speaking About The First Couple Ever Seen Of Adriatic Kind
Gli Amanti Vanno Lieti Nell'aria Di Settembre,
I Loro Gesti Accompagnano Ombre Di Parole Che Non Conosci,
Non Hanno Pietï¿½, E Tu Tenuta Dalla Terra Che Lamenti?
All Alone Remain You Here, My Start Maybe Is Your The Same In Rage And Fear
Remote Are The Dead Ones And A Lot More Living, My Silent, Vile Comrades
Every Secret Got It's Time, Before The Silence Too,
Can't Live On What Isn't The Truth Within Tomorrow I Realize Again What You Don't Want To Say
Because Light's Only The Missing Dark And The Dog Star Lost Its Color
And Every Hour It's Drive Far Away And The Seagull Makes Angry On The Forlorn Shores
(Drawn From Poetry "Davanti Al Simulacro D'Ilaria Del Carretto" By Salvatore Quasimodo)
