[music by En Declin - lyrics by Maurizio Tavani]

Every Day You Would Like To Start Again Look Around And Only Run Into Difficulties
All Turns And Returns As It Was There Is Not An End In Front Of You
The Air Cool Down And The Light Goes Off
Without Leaving Trace Of You Think You Will Go And All Will Have An End
In Indifference You Are Lost, In Mind Nothing Remains
You Look At Yourself And Set Your Heart On Looking For The Jolt You Run After Spaces
You Want To Act You Look For A Contact In Order Not To Drown You Lose Your Control
