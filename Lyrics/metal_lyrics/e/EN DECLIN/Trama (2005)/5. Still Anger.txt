[music by En Declin - lyrics by Maurizio Tavani]

Strangely Alone Thoughts Assail Me And In Indecision You End By Making Mistake
Strange My Destiny I Dream What I Haven't Got But If It's Right Allowed To Change
Tell Me Why Pretend Strangely Alone As If I Wasn't True As If I Wasn't Alive
It's Not Easy To Change It's Not Easy For Me Either Closed In Silence Truths Disappear
Frenetic Moments Of Lucidity Remain Fragile In The Reality
I Listen The Voice In My Mind I Will Do This To Myself It Will Be My Sacrifice
Painful Promises Where Whispered I Want To Be Enlightened Informed About The End
It Will Be My Sacrifice It Will Be My Anger
