[music by En Declin - lyrics by Carmelo Paci]

The End Of Run Among The Grass Compel To Share The Beauty Still
Two Hands Too Near Can Be Blade A Single One God Or Sworn
Weak Your Trying To Not Be Blade Drive To Open Wide Your Senses
And Stand By The Mean Of Them Sure They Are Other By You
While Day Falls Down... I Keep On Share The Waiting Room Of Before
