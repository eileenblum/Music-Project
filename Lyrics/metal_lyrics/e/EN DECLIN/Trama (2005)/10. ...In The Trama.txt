[music by En Declin - lyrics by Maurizio Tavani]

It's Like That Fragile And Strong When One Is Alone
So Limpid And Confused Sure Of All And Sure Of Nothing
It's Incredible As A Single Man Can Change The Things
Badly Makes You To Be And Well, Well And Badly
You Want Me To Take Far Away From Here, For A Moment You Stayed Looking
While These Words Escape Your Breath To My Skin
You Can't Start Again What Creeds Don't Have Importance
You Will Take Your Things And You'll Go
And When You Come Back You Will Remember Your Memories
With A Satisfied Smile
