[music by En Declin - lyrics by Carmelo Paci]

Come And Twist In My Silence Because Is The Only Thing I Got And I Listen It Very Long
Swallowed In Another Body, Bit The Taste I Feel Self Deranged By The Words I Don't Say
When Edge Turns Blade Day By Day When Blade Is Me Keepin' Far The Next Heart Bit
I Guess I Can't Battle It Every Second So Let Something Walks Sometimes In A Doped Grey
Still Senses As A Flight From Pain Condition Of Unintentional Will
Not From The Denial Of True Just Due By The Fall Of This
Here I Am Is The Place Of Not Want Divinity Stand Still His Blind Alley To Way Out
Because When He Move To Seize His Dafne The Mother Meets Ready To The Daughter Sacrifice
When Edge Turns Blade Day By Day When Blade Is Me Keepin' Far The Next Heart Bit
I Guess I Can't Battle It Every Second While The Next Tide It's Up To Leave From Within
Still Senses As A Flight From Pain Condition Of Unintentional Will
Not From The Denial Of True Just Due By The Fall Of This
