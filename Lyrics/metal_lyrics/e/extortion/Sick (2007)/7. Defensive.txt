This is it, the fighting back
I won't lie down, I won't take this crap
I won't be subject to humiliation
I won't stand for this home invasion
What do you expect?
That I'd just take it I bet
Well for my life I'll be prepared
For my life I will defend

Built to fight back
Built to fight

Gone to far, crossed the line
You won't leave alive this time
I don't know how you gone in
But you won't be leaving here
Fucking filth get off the floor
I've seen shit like you before
I took them and I'll take you
It's just a matter of time it's true

Built to fight back
Built to fight
Built to fight back
Built to fight
