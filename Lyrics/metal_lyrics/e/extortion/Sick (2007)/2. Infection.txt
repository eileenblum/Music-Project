It's all so simple, just one action
Just the one smallest gesture
No guard to let down, you let it
Walk right in now you're infected

Condemned
Your life ends

Just one breath you take without a
Thought could leave you royally fucked
The walking dead, now you're condemned
But still unaware of your ill luck

Condemned
Your life ends

Condemned to drop dead
How sudden your life ends
Condemned to drop dead
