"Hi, hey I don't think I'll make in today
I feel like shit
I don't know what it is
I just woke up feeling sick
Yeah, I might just rest up and wait it out
And if it gets any worse I'll get a doctor to check it out
But don't worry, you'll be the first to know
If I won't be in tomorrow, but I don't expect this
Will get
Any worse

You know I'd be in anyway to do my work, but then
I'd infect everybody, I'd be a fucking jerk, hah
I guess I'll see you late, I'm gonna rest.
Nah I'm not going anywhere except straight to bed"
