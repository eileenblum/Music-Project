Can't fight the urge
Somethings wrong can't find the fault
The instinct to purge
So take it all and throw it out
Pressure builds up
Your body rejects whats inside
Nausea is on the rise

A system doesn't know whats fucked
So rejects anything that not
Essential to function
Regurgitate almost everything
Who knows what making you sick?
Shitting, pissing, pour out vomit
