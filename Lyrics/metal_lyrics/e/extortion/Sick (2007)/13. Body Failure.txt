Your organs shutting off
One by one, the gears stop
Your body grinds to a halt
Battered by an internal assault
Failure

It's falling apart
The weight of every breath
Is almost too much to bear
It's falling apart

Your organs shutting off
One by one, the gears stop
Your body grinds to a halt
Battered by an internal assault
Failure
