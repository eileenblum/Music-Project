Your insides are infested
No you can't control the spread
Your body's overrun
And internal war's being led

Overrun

An army made of sickness
An aggressive pathogen
In the face of an onslaught
It's you versus a million

Overrun
You're overrun

Immune system in overdriver
Fighting to cut them down to size
It's a war that you'll fight
Or wind up buried alive

You're fighting against the tide

Overrun
You're overrun
