One step closer with every breath
A killer whose very touch means death
Keeps on killing, won't get caught
Won't be seen, free to walk
His name is know and causes fear
This massacre won't stop it's clear

Won't get caught
Keeps in killing
Won't get caught
Can't be stopped

No prevention
And there's no cure
Except isolation
From the whole world

Attacks you from the inside
You can't run and you can't hide
A monster you can't even see
Killing quick and easily
Moving on another victim
How fast it spreads, how fast it sickens

Won't get caught
Keeps in killing
Won't get caught
Can't be stopped

No prevention
And there's no cure
Except isolation
From the whole world
Lock from the doors
Let no one in
Then you'll be sure
You won't be a victim
