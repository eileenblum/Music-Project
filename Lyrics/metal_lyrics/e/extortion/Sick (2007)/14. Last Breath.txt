Your last breath
If you knew
Was coming for you
Your last breath
If you were here
Would you be consumed by fear?

Inhale, exhale
You are on your way out

Your last breath
One last shot
Last ditch attempt
Before you give up
Your body's damaged far too much
No coming back
You're completely fucked
Your last breath
You won't know
When or how
You let go
Your last breath
No goodbyes said
