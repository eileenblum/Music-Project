The odds aren't in your favour
You're fighting for your life
If you weren't unconscious
You'd realise you're in strife

Torn apart
Facing defeat, now you're fucked
Nearing the end
Couldn't fight back, couldn't defend

Even if you pulled a miracle
Out of the thin air
Your body's been damaged
Damaged beyond repair

Roll the dice
Losing the call, paying the price
Now that you've lost
You pay with your life, that's all it cost
Losing battle
This is where it ends
