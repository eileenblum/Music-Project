Your body's burning up, there's no scape
From your fevered state
Stuck on overdrive, still you lie
With your skin on fire
A body slick with sweat, in your bed filthy, almost dead
Stinking inanimate mess, is how you're left
Laid out but still can't rest

Burn up, burn down, burnt out
Burn up, burn down, burnt out

You body smoking out sickness now
The only way it know how
Burning down the house to kill the thief seems to extreme but
Regardless this is you sitting through
Being completely screwed
By you body's own defense, own defense
Has drained you and left you spent

Burn up, burn down, burnt out
Burn up, burn down, burnt out
