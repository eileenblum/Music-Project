Television, the price of fuel
What you're wearing &amp; who fucks who
Celebrities on news reports
Expensive cars &amp; T.V sports
You ant see you're blind, none of this matters
It's insignificant
You can ride this shit up as of important
Whilst real lives are wasted over boarders
Fill your eyes with shit till you're blind
I'll sit &amp; watch with hands tied
