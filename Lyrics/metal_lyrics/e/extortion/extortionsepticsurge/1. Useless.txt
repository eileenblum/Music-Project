You never thought it'd would come to this
Started out with just one hit
Then a couple of years down the track
You're screaming out for another whack
You'd hock your wife's wedding ring
Burglary fills your syringe
Miserable fucking low-life
A chemical enslaving your life
You've been reduced to an animal
