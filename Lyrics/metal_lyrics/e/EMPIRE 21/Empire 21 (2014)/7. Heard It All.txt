Who can give me everything? Everything I voted for
Everything a western man deserves
Left or right, it's both alright, as long as I can get a big bite
In the end it's never what it seems

What we need is more and more
Of wisdom divine to govern our minds
I have heard it all before
They're playing their game â their false propaganda

Blame the ones who came before, everything they're fighting for
Everything they offer on their plate
Save the people on the street, as long as I can make ends meet
Calculation, recession, depression, secularization

What we need is more and more
Of wisdom divine to govern our minds
I have heard it all before
They're playing their game â their false propaganda
