Everything you'll ever need I offer you
Still you say I walk away
Every step you take I watch and follow you
Even when you go astray

Get up, stand up, walk beside me
Toss your guilt now let it go
May I see you walk my ways and
May I catch you when you're falling

All that you forsake and every change you take
What is precious? What is true?
It is all a matter of your point of view
They will tell you that it's true

Get up, stand up, walk beside me
Toss your guilt now let it go
May I see you walk my ways and
May I catch you when you're falling

May I see you walk my ways and
May I catch you when you're falling
