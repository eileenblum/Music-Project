Tell me that all is a twist of fate
Tell me that all is a fairytale
Is it all coincidence?
Tell me just how we come this far
Tell me just how we raise the bar
So high, oh why, why are we here?

Is there anybody there?
Anyone in space and time
Who is the master of the great design?

All is lost, all is gone
Without hope we carry on
We're trying to hide the truth, the wisdom all along

I know it's all been a matter of use and abuse in the name of God
But is it all coincidence?
I know the story just like you do
No one can prove it, so no one can really tell
Does it prove coincidence?

Is there anybody there?
Anyone in space and time
Who is the master of the great design?

All is lost, all is gone
Without hope we carry on
We're trying to hide the truth, the wisdom all along
