We are victims, of our weaknesses
We are suffering from ignorance and bitterness
We are nothingâ¦ on this grain in space
That's the doctrineâ¦ that's the truthâ¦

All the love that was meant for us
It is time to claim what's lost

We are soldiers, this is the final hour
No matter the winds of change
We are soldiers, this is the final call
No matter the winds of change

We are living in denial
We are sailing on the ocean of oblivion
We get nothing and we curse and blameâ¦
It's a doctrine it's a truthâ¦ it's a lie!

All the love that was meant for us
It is time to claim what's lost

We are soldiers, this is the fin al hour
No matter the winds of change
We are soldiers, this is the final call
No matter the winds of change

We are nothingâ¦ on this grain in space
That's the doctrineâ¦ that's the truthâ¦

All the love that was meant for us
It is time to claim what's lost

We are soldiers, this is the fin al hour
No matter the winds of change
We are soldiers, this is the final call
No matter the winds of change
