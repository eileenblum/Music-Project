I wonder how we came this far? This far from home
I listen close as we turnâ¦ turn to stone

Temptations came, we just drifted away
All that you gave was left in the dark

This is my story
This is the essence of my life
I ask you forgive my sins and bring me home again

I'm not the one to cast the stone
Too far from home
I say I care but still forget all regrets

No matter what I failed in the past
No one will find me left in the dark

This is my story
This is the essence of my life
I ask you forgive my sins and bring me home again
