Sorry for the time I was away
I thought I had to go, I thought I had to see
What was out there in the cold
Searching for a new trailâ¦

Chasing a dream I thought that I need
Playing the role I thought they wanted
I don't wanna mess around, mess around anymore
I put my foot down

One road goes up and the other road goes down
I am a traveler but I'm coming back now
I've had enough of the other side of town
I am a traveler but I'm coming back now

Hot winds and dusty roads
Staying focused on my goal
What was out there, I don't know
All I know is I'm going home

Chasing a dream I thought that I need
Playing the role I thought they wanted
I don't wanna mess around, mess around anymore
I put my foot down

One road goes up and the other road goes down
I am a traveler but I'm coming back now
I've had enough of the other side of town
I am a traveler but I'm coming back now
