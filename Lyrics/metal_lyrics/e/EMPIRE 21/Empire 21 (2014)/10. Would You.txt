I'm yearning every day, for peace of mind
I've tried to find a way, it seems so hard to find
As the liar pushes untruths on
To adore and admire, 'til my sense is gone
On and on and on

Would you cry for me? Show your faith repeatedly
Would you die for me? I am trying desperately
As time goes by, until the day I die, would you be?
Would you cry for me?

As humble as can be, I'm asking you
Please can you set me free and make my vision new
Give me guidance until my work is done
Save me from subsidence and lead my way on
On and on and on

Would you cry for me? Show your faith repeatedly
Would you die for me? I am trying desperately
As time goes by, until the day I die, would you be?
Would you cry for me?
