See me, tell me I am someone
Feed me, give me what I think I need
I scream, I cry
I live â but see no reason whyâ¦

I can't move on, I can't forget
Can't be strong, no no
I can't be strong, I can't confess
To belong, no no

I've seen dreams that turned to stone
I've gained nothing on my own
I scream, I try
I live â but I still must die

I can't move on, I can't forget
Can't be strong, no no
I can't be strong, I can't confess
To belong, no no

I will move on, I will forget
Found my way to go
I will be strong, I will confess
To belong to you
