Get up, get up, get up and prove it. Rich, famous, mortal man
Get down, get down, get down to business. Every cent will turn to sand
Wash away your conscience. Clock is ticking as we sleep
Building castles in the sand

Every burning hour, every minute feeling pain
While our minds devour human wisdom, your own savior
Building castles in the sand

Right now, can you hear me calling, calling?
To save you from this hell, I'm calling, calling

Listen closely now, this is what I have to say
We are heading down the drain and we don't care
No matter what we choose, blinded by our human wisdom
We're building castles in the sandâ¦

Right now, can you hear me calling, calling?
To save you from this hell, I'm calling, calling
