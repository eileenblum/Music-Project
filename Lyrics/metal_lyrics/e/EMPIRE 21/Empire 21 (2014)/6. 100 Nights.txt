Run away, fly away, let us head out far away
No horizon seems too far
Gazing out to the sky, soaring over mountains high
Winds are whispering in silence
Never let go, the journey goes on

Once in my life I'm standing strong
Walk with me, by my side
Hundred nights and a hundred rainy days
Come with me and go with the flow no more

Off the course, catch my breath, the sun is punishing my shoulders
I passed the point of no return
I need to make this journey now, down the road it might get harder
Aiming high to reach my goal
Never let go, the journey goes on

Once in my life I'm standing strong
Walk with me, by my side
Hundred nights and a hundred rainy days
Come with me and go with the flow no more
