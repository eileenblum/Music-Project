After the fire when the smoke has cleared
After the liar and his angels disappeared

And I saw a new heaven and I saw the world
The place I once knew
As the empire rises and heaven and earth must bow
On this day, all things new

In the ruins and the flooded land
Out of the ashes we are risen by God's hand

And I saw a new heaven and I saw the world
The place I once knew
As the empire rises and heaven and earth must bow
On this day, all things new
