Possessed by your other "me"
Devilish embodiment of your alter ego
Given to the trials of endurance 
Of your human psyche

So furious your existence 
Begins to make your being crazy 
Unability to connect personalities 
Pushes you to fury 

Uncontrolled convulsion
Body longing for fulfilment 
Its deepest desires
Where are you?

You want to get out of the madness
And rule your mind
Just you and you brain
You don't wont to serve until the end

To get out of the fury
To discover your real self
The most important in your life 
Is to stand with yourself, face to face 

Humiliated you need to touch
Your real self
Stop the tolerance of strange thoughts 
You want to act on your own
