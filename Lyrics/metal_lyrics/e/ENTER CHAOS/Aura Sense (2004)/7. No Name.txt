The colour of our senses
Reflecting our souls 
Feel my energy through your eyes
Read me through your touch

Recognize the states of the psyche 
It's so simple, don't come closer 
Whem I'm the agressive-coloured 
Try to understand it

World without senses inside of me 
Taste its rainbow 
Enjoy the red of aura 
Hot like a beating heart 

Your may save both of us 
Pay attention to the colours 
Feelings are so close to them
They become one 

Learn me as I learn you
Discover colours of the conciousness
Anger, sadness, enthusiasm
All clearly visible 

Don't give up
It's worthy to find out the depth 
Discover each other 
Deel each other through energy 

Beating radiation of our bodies 
Shall tell more 
Betray all our secrets
You don't have to obe shy
