You can already see yourself on the top
You seem to know what you are worthy 
You believe your own streanght 
But is ut based?

Stand next to body and mind
You feed upon the colorful reality 
Not able to release from the pression
Of your pressure

Everyone attacks you
Everyone wishes you failure 
They want to kick your ass
You think how to bite it

Pathetic fight takes up your mind 
"What shall i do
To become the great and the beloved?"

It's your great, lost day 
Beggining of the first end
Give up the pedestal
Look around and see
You're just like all the others 
Just your mind took a break

Do you really think
It will last forever 
Is it really 
The way you want
