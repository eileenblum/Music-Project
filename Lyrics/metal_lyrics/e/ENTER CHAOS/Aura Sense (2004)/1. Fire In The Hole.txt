Where's the fucking god
when i kill
where's fucking god
when i decide who's next to die today

I've got a gun. I kill, am I god??
or only his tool
I pull the trigger again

Who really cares what the war is about?
fuck it! Kill them all!
They shoot at me, they're my enemies
the rest is only an excuse 

People die? who cares!
They're just pawns created to higher reasons 
Their death won't change the world 
But someone will win the war

Blood mixes with sand 
Red stains remain on snow 
The will soon dissapear 
and I will kill another freaks

Shoot! Kill!
Finish off it necessary 
With no order, with no reason
Just for fun
