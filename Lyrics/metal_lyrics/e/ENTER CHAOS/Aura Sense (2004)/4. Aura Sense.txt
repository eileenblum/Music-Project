Hidden conspiracy to take up the fight
There's no greater satisfaction than to win

Hidden in the shadows of screaming heads 
You'll soon deprive them of thoughts 
Too many empty words
Time to rise into the new world 

Better to die than to live 
With people pretending to be good
Than listen to their lies 
Get checks not to be released 

Time to wake up from vanity 
False, lies and betrayal
Nobody wants to be victim
So what's the reason to torture 

Turn loose from the sick minds 
It's better to live like a man
(The wicked muse leave
That's the will of the new era)

The time of victory
Many never come 
You rist the curse of your brothers 
And eternal damnation

Like white angel cover with blood 
With your sever words and deeds 
You'll bring the new world the message if you win
