Sounds destroy the silence 
Just like a thunder roar 
Torture your ears
Rise your fist and bang your head 
Smell the realm of death

Metal is much more than leather 
Metal is much more than black
Metal is what flows and boils 
In my veins and in my heart

Sharper than hell razor!
Faster than the light!
Darker than pure evil!
Hordes come and go
But metal still remains 
The lover of my inside 

Pentagram on your neck
Exclaims that you're evil
Corpse paint on your face 
Makes you being deamon
But deep inside your heart 
You're weak, shit worthly freak!

Metal is such power
You cannot understand 
Dont even exert yourself 
Go on! Scream you're the truest 
I don't give a fuck

The true shal true remain...forever!!
The metal shall remain...forever!!
