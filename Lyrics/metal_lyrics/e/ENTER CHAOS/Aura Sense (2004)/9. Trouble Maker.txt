You think you're wise 
Always think twice 
Great, you want to throw litter on those who are worthy that
But not make up your mind of useless matter

People unworthy of your attention
Why waste the time and energy 
To explain them the're wrong 
That they destroy each other
And everything around 
Don't be fool

Don't let them involve your in this game 
You don't need another worries 
Leaving bitter taste in your mouth
Letting you down till the fucking death

Your calm or total war
In advence sentenced to failures 
Don't be ideal
That's not your part
Not this act, not this stage
You must be fool

To throw yourself into the abyss of unfulfullment 
World can be sick
People can be strangers to your conciusness
Why take care so much
You won't win release for your soul
Neither now, nor forever

Disability of the world is not your fucking business
Don't waste your force for unreal
It's not worthy
