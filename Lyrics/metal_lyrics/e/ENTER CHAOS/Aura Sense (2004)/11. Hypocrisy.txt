So many kings to rule the world 
So many people in mask of goodness 

Unlearned by time and history 
The're still making the same mistakes 

Madness has settle in their minds for good 
Massacre is their way to gloss over their crime 

And you - human being 
What do you have for excuse?
Have you ever wanded justice?

In mad run for the highest trophy 
You're living in the egoistic cage 

Even now, when reality stand upon your door
Derisive smile didn't dissapear from your face 

Bowing to your new king 
You're ploting how to deprive him of power
