To shine in the firmament 
It tempts to much
Prospect of being a star
Blinds you

You give your soul
Defect your sensability 
Wipe out any traces of humanity

The joy of life fades with the fall
Of worship for you
The will of being the idol
Destroys you

Love for unlimited power
The will to enter masses' minds 
Self-satisfaction through existence 
Calms your conciousness
And missunderstood power

Star in the blue sky 
You will never shine equally for all
You won't exist in minds of many
It's only your stick desire

There's no rescue for the sick
The soul's rotten to the core
There's no cure for your imagination
You're just "sentenced to success"

Sold out for your own request
