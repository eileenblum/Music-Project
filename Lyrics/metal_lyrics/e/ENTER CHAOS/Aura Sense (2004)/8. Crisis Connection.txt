One day so happy
The next, world's over 
Your choice turned to be missed 
You bear an unhealing wound in your heart 
Words and deeds no more the same 
You can't recognize yourself 
Ignorance no longer helps 
How to cease the series of hurt?

One day so wonderful 
The next, like a hurricane 
It's time to release the forces 
Connect with the crisis centre 
In your mind 
Rise to treat the feelings 
It's pity those memorable scars 
Will stay in your heart forever 

Wise after the loss
You return to yourself
You'll never feel similar pain
The dead silence 
The great dispair
Crisis centre disconnected 
You're like a steel wall
Echoing the trash with rumble 
"Hit me again
And I'll show you my fist"

Destroy your crisis.....
