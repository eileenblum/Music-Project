I think about you baby
When I lay down to sleep
I long to lick your trigger 
And take the souls to reap
Death become my obsession
All life is my possession
I feel the need to kill
Again, I know i will

I take all life 
When my handgun by my side 
I have control
No time to cry when the breath is gone 

I hear his sight, I'm going crazy 
Come baby, come right on my face 
And leave the body down to waste

Blood explodes from your pierced head
Your heart no longer beats 
Yeah! You're already dead

When my handgun starts to speak 
The night black, cold and wild
I hear your whisper in my head 
I have to help them die 
I have to see them dead!
