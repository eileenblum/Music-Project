Only dreams uncover your face
Real self, what you hide unaware of
What makes that you hurt the alive
The lethal dreams

Enter your mind now
What can you see?
Your deepest fears consume the cells
Killing you

You won't run too far
Without entering yourself
With no analysis of what you read in your soul
Dream
Be careful
Or you may fall down
To the end of your humanity

The lethal dreams - impose you their rules
Limit your comprehension

You against your dreams
The fight for liberation

Don't let the lethal dreams
To lead your ego
Wake up
Think
Don't die

For you're a man
For you are strong
For you're created to rule your life
To take your fortune into hands

The lethal dreams
- don't give up
Master of life
Control your mind
With no fear
With no blame
With will
