Show your force now
When chaos takes your mind
The cup of hatred is overfilled
Enter yourself to find out
You can ignore what's evil

Can you feel your hatred
Can you see what they did?

Shut somebody's mouth which tell no truth
Crush their meaningless bodies
Stop the spreading war and chaos
That your consciousness cannot bear

Take a deep breath to fill your deeds
Anger is your companion
Suppressing the injustice is your salvation
Chaos pulls you down
Destroy their self-confidence

Give them back what they had given
Enough of selling your good will

Now it is their chaos
They are deprived of feelings
Don't let it devour you
Fly high over people's swindles
Be yourself despite the chaos set in
