Our world is dying
Destruction of our planet
It's the ancient gods' revenge
For human sins
And converting a new religion

We have to run away
To save the human kind
Save our children
From the destruction in this hell
To give them chance for a good life

In a new universe
Among the stars far away
In a new universe
You will find yourself
Return to the old beliefs
To your roots
Refuse technofethishism
Burn all bridges after you

... to the old and rotten world
Rotten by the industrial disease
Lie, jealousy and hatred
Where the hypocrisy of church
Kills human reflexes
There's only survival instinct left
So make use of it!

If you miss your chance
You'll die with the earth
Down with jealousy
Trodden by hatred
Go the journey to the stars
That's the only way to freedom
