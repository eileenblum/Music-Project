There are places where the fallen angels go
Those who've lost their lifes
Everyone's born with a clear card
It's up to you what to write on

Will you go down in history
Will you find the way there
Where no angels sing
Silence... Emptiness...
And hundreds of angels dead
People too weak
To win their lifes
You've joined them
For your sins of life

Emptiness... Silence...
And cold touch of fallen angels
Living dead
Lingering on their deeds
Sentenced to madness
To eternity in nothingness
Forceless and weak
One day so sure and powerful

Fight! Change your destiny
Don't let to knock you off
To the place where the lost vegetate
And the angels' singing is only an illusion
