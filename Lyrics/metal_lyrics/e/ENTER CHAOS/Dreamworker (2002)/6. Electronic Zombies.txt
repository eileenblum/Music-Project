Technology
A religion of the weak

A black box
Standing as the altar
You pray to it
And it leads
Your wretched life

Create your thoughts
Speak as you have
To behave
To act

You forget about dreams
And desires
You only want
More new images

Technofethishism is an escape
From the bleak abyss of reality
Illusive paradise for fools
Enchanted by the new trends

You wake up craving
For the touch of your god and
The sounds flowing from the altar
You reach for the remote control

Falling asleep you say goodbye
To your technolove
But dreams don't come
Your mind misses the life

Fool is the one who believes
In the killing technology
Lives in the world for
Electronic zombies
