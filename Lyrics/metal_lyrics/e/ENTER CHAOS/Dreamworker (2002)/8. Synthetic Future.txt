The effects of following days
Sentenced to degradation
Without a shadow of chance for life
In a safe world around

The door of future is narrow
Not everyone will be able to cross it
Subordinate or you will fail
Synthetic future

Children of unreal world
Products manufactured with failure
Defective mechanism still working
The time is running to our disadvantage

The limits will be growing
You will be getting smaller
The future will be your curse
Synthetic visions will hide
The priceless of life

In the range of only trap
Images created by the limits

Under the pressure of future
The generation moving of internessly
