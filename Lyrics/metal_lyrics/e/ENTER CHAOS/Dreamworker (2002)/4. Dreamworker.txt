What you think
May make you believe
The faith in what you do
'll make your dreams come true

Give yourself a chance
To create a defense
They cannot destroy you
This means war

Gather all your thoughts
Your mind is a god
Create what you want
Act with passion

The will is your strenght
You cannot last inactively
The world cannot turn upside down
And think about it...

Make your own clear path
To where you want to go
Gather all your thoughts
Your mind is a god

Try, be a fortress
Thoughts last like a wall
Imagination is at your service
Nothing will stop you

Have the faith in yourself
Realize at last that
You're the main performer
Creator of the future

Mind is the beginning of everything what's holy
For it has been created by you
One man with power of a thousand
The only man thinking of the upcoming future
