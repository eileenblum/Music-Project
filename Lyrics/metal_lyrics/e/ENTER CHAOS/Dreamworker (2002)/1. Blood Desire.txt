The truth is what we believe
No matter how incredible it is
Legend or reality is
That they exist at the edge of dream and reality

Smell of blood in the air
Will you believe?
The cold blow if immortality penetrates you
Until the bleak dawn wakes up - disappears in the abyss

Pale bodies, bloodthirsty glances
Defend your fresh blood from the animal aggression

Darkness is their power
Night is their ally
Cold sweat flows down your temples
Your run to nowhere
In a moment they will get you
Blood pulsates in your veins
The sigh that you're still alive

Tell me if the source of the legend is the truth

You can see what you haven't seen
Hear unreal sounds
Is that a schizophrenic dream?
Run to the light
Beating of your heart speeds up
They'll scent you like an animal till you're alive
Put to sleep they'll wake up to taste you
To fulfill their lust and feel liberation
Dead or alive - they want to feast upon your blood
