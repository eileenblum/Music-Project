No matter how far you go insane
You promise to break the instinct
It will get you
Your fantasies speak
Eroticism flows from all your body

The power of lust will triumph
Time won't stop eternal needs

Forever you'll be influenced by charm and the power
Hidden longing burn your erotic visions
A step from madness
You take delight in sweet memories of the godly flesh

Erotic fantasies gather into waves
Take you high to touch the impossible

Slowly you are at a standstill
Steady breath dies down
Still you experience the non-existence

You whisper one name
Full of desire in your dreams

Erotic dream embraces you
In its arms you fall asleep - still wanting

Scream
- it your sin
Last in ecstasy
- aspire to satisfaction
This can be the last chance
Worthy living
