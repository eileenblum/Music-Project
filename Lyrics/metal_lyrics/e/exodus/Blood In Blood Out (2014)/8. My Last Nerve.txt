I'm so irritated
Being kicked to the curb
Every time you open your mouth
Your try to get in the last word
Those who live in glass houses
Should not be throwing stones
It all comes crashing down
You never left well enough alone

[Chorus:]
Seasons come
And treasons go
The more you hear
The less you know
So undeserved
No purpose served
All yo do is fray
My last nerve

So many excuses
Always laying the blame
You're always pointing the finger
Adding fuel to the flame
Another slander, another slur
Another hollow apology
So many verbal abuses
Believe your own mythology

[Chorus]

[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Lee]

I'll never be your scapegoat
Quote unquote
Your underling
Red light, left turn, you never learned
A crash fit for a king

[Chorus]
