[Music: Gary Holt, Lyrics: Rob Dukes]

Unrelenting vengence
On man for all his sins
Ruthless eraclication
Day of reckoning to begin
The human race is a cancer
Fueled by power and lust
Punishment is the answer
And payment is your blood

[Chorus]

Death and destruction
Hellish cries are the sound
Headlong into hell
Detribution is now
Inflict the suffering
Let the punishment fit the crime
I belong to vengeance
And vengeance is mine

Choking out the life
Of every living thing
History repeats itself
World brought down by greed
Prositute the truth
Stealing from the blind
Arrogant indifference
The raping of mankind

[Chorus]

[Solo: Gary]

Killing just for profit
And weeding out the weak
Ruling with an iron fist
The sure fot the disease
Driven by the madness
Driven by the greed
Infected by a cancer
Lust and debauchery

[Chorus]
