[Music and Lyrics: Gary Holt]

Bloodied, cleaved and mutilated
Dead bodies amputated
Mans bloody inclination
God's final abdicaton
Angels weep on bended knee
So begins the tyranny
The fallen one will rise again
So ends the time of man

[Chorus]

My will be done
Now they death day come

Never more the sound of laughter
Misery for ever after
The cries of suffering
Are what the death day bring
No one gives the benediction
All hear the maldication
Lucifer makes his accent
No words for mans laent

[Chorus]

On black wings I take to the sky
Scouring the land
Rejoicing in and laughing in
The folly of man
Centuries of hatred
Centuries of fear
Have led you to the end of days
And the one you so revere

[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Lee]

The gates of heaven have been shattered
Wings of angels torn and tattered
All due to mankind's thirst
For war so well rehearsed
When you see my demon eyes
Too late to aplolgize
Can you feel the irony?
War for all eternity

[Chorus]
