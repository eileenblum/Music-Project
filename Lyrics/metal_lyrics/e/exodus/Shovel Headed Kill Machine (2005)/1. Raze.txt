[Music: Gary Holt, Lyrics: Gary Holt, Rob Dukes]

Let's start a fire, biggest one you've ever seen
You bring the matches, I'll bring the gasoline
Ignite it, delight it, the flames grow higher
Burn the world upon a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Raze!
Light this motherfucker like a roman candle
Burn this bitch staight to the ground
Raze!
Let's not worry about consequences
If it's standing we'll bring it down

Destroy it all, show no inhibition
Revel and rejoice in unbridled demolition
Smash it, fuck it, nothing will remain
Detect it and wreck it but never take the blame

[Chorus]

We have ignition!

[Solo: Gary]
[Solo: Lee]

Shake the earth from its very foundation
Lay waste to the world without hesitation
Break it, take it, you don't have any reason
Fuck it, destuct it, its domolition season
