[Music and Lyrics: Gary Holt]

You hit rock bottom, now where do you go from here
Sunk-down, locked-up, all you do is disappear
All your promises areall just a pack of lies
Your've got nothing, something you can't recognize

[Chorus]

Why don't you take some responsibility
You're pointing fingers and blaming everybody
Shudder to think if I lived like you
They would be shaking too, if they only knew

I can't take any more excuses
No longer needed and you don't have any uses
Washed up, washed out, what more can I say
You better start filling out your resume

[Chorus]

[Solo: Gary]

Everything was there for the taking
Too Busy with the lying and faking
Drugged up, fell out, too many second chances
Nothing else to do under the circumstances

[Chorus]
