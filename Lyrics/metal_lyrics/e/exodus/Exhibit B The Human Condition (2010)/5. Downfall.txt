A crumbling empire
Where angels fear to tread
Into the ruins of a civilization
A society ripped to shreds
No semblance of order
Into the world which I abjure
Where the bloody blade is forged
Am I the cause of the cure?

[Chorus:]
Our destiny is soon revealed
Battle strewn, no way to heal
We spread the wings of failure
For the world's last goodnight
Downfall!
In the flames of the burning lands
Who claims to have the upper hand?
Bonfire of the vanities and spite

Like Sodom and Gomorrah
Forsaken and alone
Look how the mighty all have fallen
We reap what we have sewn
When all the marble palaces
Are blackened, sacked and burned
Will we understand man's ignorance
Through all the lessons learned?

[Chorus]

Fall!
Fall!
Fall!
Downfall!

[Solo Gary]

So quick to claim the credit due
Yet no one takes the blame
Like Nero played his violin
While watching Rome in flames
Implosion of our nations through
Decisions of its kings
Downfall of our creation
It's the end of everything

[Chorus]
