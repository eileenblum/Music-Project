Cesspool in orbit, our end has begun
We live on the third lump of shit from the sun
Planet in peril, but why give a fuck
Soon the earth will run out of luck
Wreck it all until the land is stripped
Rejoice in the coming apocalypse
Sing loud the world's last lullaby
But my replies

Good riddance, goodbye
So long to this fucking world, sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance, goodnight
Adios planet earth, now die

Parasitic infestation, never ending procreation
Our shit stained constellation headed for its cancellation
Eternity of desecration, another misread calculation
Give the earth one last ovation before it starts the final
Crash and burn

Get down to business, cut to the chase
It's time for mankind's fall from grace
The end's coming sooner than you'll ever know
So sit back, relax and enjoy the show
No time to cry, I won't shed a tear
This is, after all the event of the year
We can save the world
You testify, but my replies

Good riddance, goodbye
So long to this fucking world, sit back and watch it fry
Good riddance, goodnight
Adios planet earth, now die

Thanks to MatthewKelly for correcting track #12 lyrics.
