Did you win the lotto and you said she's a whore
By my life but it is cannot tell our soon survival
Well it might be a thing
Time to think about this well it might be

You never said on the question I could be free
You'd never need anyone to help you do away with me
Death and domination
I just want to breathe
Please don't do away with me
I want to love
Death and domination

So now I take your life to see whose a thief
I can't let you take my clothes, because I was all weak
I can't let get you near my life you said you're cursed
Now your life is mine to sell who is the worst
