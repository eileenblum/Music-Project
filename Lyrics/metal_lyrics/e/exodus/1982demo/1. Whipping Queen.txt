When you think everybody's fine
Then it starts cracking she flies up in the sky
Taking the souls away from hell living in her dark dark place
Trying to be the most evil witch in this town she says it's nothing but luck
Must be a liar fight the power
She never takes no for an answer she always get what she wants
She doesn't realize she's a whipping queen what else do you want

To those who accept the following lies construct their own reality
So farewell is what you away rubbing eyes with Satan
Scheming in the darkness you know your lady love you wished you had never kissed
She never takes no for an answer she always get what she wants
She doesn't realize she's a whipping queen what else do you want
