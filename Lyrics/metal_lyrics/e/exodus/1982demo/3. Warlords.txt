When you feel no mercy and you want to kill
Going to take a little something because she wants the thrill
Wanting something for nothing pay the price for pain
There were six physicians and they were all insane

We are warlords right here spreading hatred and fear
I think it brightens our world when you walk out the car
When you feel the fear, and you want to run getting chased by a lady
Wish you had a gun it questions the law we're all full of greed.
We're all senseless and liars and lawless spreading like a disease.
There are warlords right here spreading hatred and fear
I think it brightens our world when you walk out the door
