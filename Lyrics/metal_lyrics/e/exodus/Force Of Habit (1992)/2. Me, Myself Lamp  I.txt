Good Samaritans are something I can't stand
Suppressing their own needs to lend a helping hand
Looking out for number one is my only creed
Self-preservation runs deep in my breed

I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be

Me, myself and I - Only these three apply
Me, myself and I - On these three I rely
Me, myself and I - My only true ally
Me myself and I - I'm greed personified

Thinking of myself is all I ever do
Not a single thought will I waste on you
My only concerns are things pertaining to me
Don't bother trying to find any generosity

I, me, mine suits me just fine
I won't even give you the time
Go out and buy your own watch
I ask nothing of you but leave me be

No charity, no one rides for free
No solicitors, can't you fuckin' read?
Take your social clauses and your empty pleas
Me, myself and I is the only thing for me
