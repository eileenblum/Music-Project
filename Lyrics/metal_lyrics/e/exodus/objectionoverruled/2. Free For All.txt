Never before have I turned on you
You look too good to me
Your beady eyes, they could cut me in two
And i just can't let you be
Well, it's a free for all, and I heard it said
You can bet your life
Stakes are high and so am I
It's in the air tonight

See you there with your Cheshire grin
I got my eyes on you
Shake your tail feather in my face and there's no tell in what I'll do
Well look here, you sweet young thing: the magic's in my hands
When in doubt, I'll whip it out. I got me in a rock'n'roll band
It's a free for all

Here we go! Look out below! I'm on the prowl tonight
When it's said and done, I'll have my fun. I can chew anything I bite
Come on, come all, to a midnight ball. The invitation's there
Come alone and I'll drive it home. I'll help you, I do declare
It's a free for all

Never before have I turned on you
Well you look too good to me
Your beady eyes, they could cut me in two
And i just can't let you be
Well, it's a free for all, and I heard it said
You can bet your life
Stakes are high and so am I
It's in the air tonight
It's a free for all
