[Lyrics &amp; music (G. Holt)]

It is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray

Take you out, right you off,
There's never enough
Ways to throw you away

[Chorus:]
You'd better start runnin'
Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You should've thought twice
Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist

You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me

Take you out, write you off,
When I've had enough
Of your verbal debris

[Repeat Chorus]

[1st Solo G. Holt]

[2nd Solo R. Hunolt]

For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me, slag me
You'd better body bag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run as fast as you can

Take you out, write you off.
Are you brave enough
To stand up and fight like a man?

[Repeat Chorus]
