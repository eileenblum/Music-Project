[Music (G. Holt) Lyrics (J. Miller)]

Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

[Chorus:]
I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired, I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you

I get off on negativity
Makes me laugh to see your strife
I won't succumb to your numb
I owe nothing to no one
Are you sick of me
I don't care
Never be a kiss ass
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

[Repeat Chorus]

[2x]
Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you

Like you
Like you
Like you

[1st Solo - R. Hunolt]

[2nd Solo - G. Holt]

Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated

[Repeat Chorus]

[2x]
Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you

Throwing down
