My will be done and I won't hesitate
To tempt your weary heart in my hands
Persuade you to feel that affection is real
When I'm finished, you'll be dead in the sand
Mosh on sad eyes after taking your prize
That was given as a token of love
Give me your hind, I'm yours all the time
Until another victim will come

Crawl on your knees, asking "why did you leave?"
As I introduce you to the new piece
Cheated in ways beyond bad taste
Your soul was but a toy in my tease
Breaking young hearts across the land
As I wake up in a different place
You do it for me, it's easy to see
Your pitied, lonely looks in my face

I'll make you obey
Don't try to delay
You never will learn
You always return to
Exhorder...
Exhorder...

I am the sadist that dwells in your mind
You run back helpless, I cheat you blind
I can desecrate the highest class of human life
Lure and seduce the ever faithful preacher's wife
