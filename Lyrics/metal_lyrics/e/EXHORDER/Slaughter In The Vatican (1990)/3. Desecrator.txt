My religion is myself
Desecration's my belief
Your misfortune's my enjoyment
And I thrive on your disease
I don't care about your feelings
Pain and torment's what you'll get
I'll rape your heart of love
And I'll make you eat my shit

I'll piss on your grave
Total desecration
I spit in your face
For no apparent reason
I'm sick and depraved
Society's garbage of what I'm made
Devoted to hatred
Unholy war and violent ways

Virgin Mary's cursed to hell
Who needs her anyway?
The Pope is slaughtered in the street
Catholics grieving at his feet
Painting of satanic stars
Desecrating church's walls
I have no rules, I have no mercy
No remorse, I feel no pity, life is death to me
The desecrator

Agnostic beliefs
Defecate before the holy world's maternity
Origin of the species, strongest shall survive
Blitzkrieg tactics upon your family life
I need no reason, there's no cause
All I need is victims to exercise my hateful laws

My pleasure is your pain, your grievance is my gain
Desecration's my greatest pleasure in life
Your children will be my sacrifice
Offspring slaughtered, lacerate your spouse
My itch is scratched, I feel relieved
That I brought your fucking world down to its' knees

Fuck your God
No regard for your religion
Pacifist
No need to pray for my forgiveness
Exhorted coitus
Beg me to release your life
Slaughtered child
How could your lord allow him to die?

Placid world once alive
Dig your grave and jump inside
Never trust, never love
Dig your grave it's just as such
You weakened hearts are torn to shreds
A lying beast now has your head
Kill, rape, hurt, steal
No living time to heal
Desecrated, desecrated, desecrated, desecrated, die!!
