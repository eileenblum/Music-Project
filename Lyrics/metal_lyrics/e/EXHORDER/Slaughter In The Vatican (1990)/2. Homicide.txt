I love pain, I live to fight
Homicide is what I like
Full of anger, and filled with hate
Violent scene makes me feel great
Kill for pleasure, kill for fun
Show no mercy on the helpless one
Run 'em through, until they're dead
Cut the guts out, leave the body lay there

Homicide

Hang the pope, spill his blood
Leave his body lying in the mud
Rape the whore, bestial lust
Slit her throat cause she's a lousy fuck
See the infant, take it's life
Lick the blood off of the knife
Violent love, violent hate
Feel content about the lives we take

Down on your knees
Piss on your pleas
Nowhere to hide
From homicide

Fuck the authorities, piss on your lord
I am the law, death shall be
Pleasure to witness, you become a corpse
There is no remorse

Pray to your god while you still have some time
Death is so near, lethal gasp
Slit your throat, violent rage
One more death, turn the page
Taste the blood of the victim
Possessed by the killing

[Chorus]
