you've given your life to
decadent goals
with a blessed look in
your eyes
repent at your mass for
the night before
when sex was the sinister
prize

beg
get on your knees and
pray
all is well, all's okay
cast the first stone with
pride
lusting the whores at
night

drowning in pleasure,
inhaling your love
bringing on hatred and
lies
your furnace awaits you,
indulgence found home
born again blasphemer
dies

cry
your soul has been
damned from the sky
communion no longer
suffices
flames rising for your
demise
confession was only a lie
