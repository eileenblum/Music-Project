stalks are generated and
they engrave
their names upon the
fields
blasts of charismatic
droplets anoint
me through my dying...

groping, seizing, tearing,
grasping at
the tail of sanity
a thrust of uninvited
rage combusts inside
the gut, and here we have
another day
if only I'd pierced it with
my hand
or watched it burn into
the ground
a joyous blaze of life's end

[chorus:]
find me, keep me, lose me,
weep me
how the tears they do
entertain
it's nice to be reminded
that I can
still bring you pain
satisfaction remains best
without subtraction
soul search me
you're empty

and as you try to liberate
the world
remember what I say
"give and take's not how I
live
I fucking take, you'd
better give"
the barrier is gonna break
cleanse the brains they've
washed in your sink

[repeat chorus]

digging deep inside you'll
find
a box without any chains
and with no locks
come on, Pandora, open
wide and
release the entity
concealed inside
BAM!!
the bricks caress your face
spread you thin across
the ground
the aches and pains
convey my thoughts to
yours
you tried to find me out

say Jack, what's a 
backstabber like you
gonna do with one like
me
discomfort multiplied by
ten, you writhe
and twist again
please have some pain
the grain against which
you rub is my terrain
so take a giant step back
'cause
you've marched across my
line
and my gun works fine

soul search me
you're empty
