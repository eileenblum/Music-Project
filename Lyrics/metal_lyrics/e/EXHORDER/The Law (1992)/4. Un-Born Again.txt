hey you there in the chair
why don't you hear your
own self?
you could find utopia
but instead your brain is
dead

you talk of pains of love
and transcendence from
above
before you know it you'll
be six feet under
as unconsciousness
envelops you
you've missed out on the
big deal
so all aboard without
your lord and all of his
ministry
'cause in the making's
history
disparage faith
and as you write I shall
dictate

feed a starving woman
dress the man
then go to heaven like a
good American
and as the promised gates
of serene recognizance
fade into a numbing non-
existence you will rot
away
without ever really
having anything...

disregard their
settlement
and be one like me
un-born again

sources say gods are the
way
and question not the
reason

How can you pretend?
Amen!
Shalom!

Really? Hallelujah's gonna
buy a
first class seat?
well let me tell you
something brother
that can't be beat!
Well, I've heard the voice a
thousand times
the one you say created
mine
but I've come to
understand
the voice is from the man
in me and
not the one you've given
higher ground

do you understand
I'm un-born again
do you understand
I'm un-born again

it's a laughing shame that
they've
twisted your brain
you could be one like me
making your own
decisions
like you ought to be
and from then you shall
have become
unborn again
