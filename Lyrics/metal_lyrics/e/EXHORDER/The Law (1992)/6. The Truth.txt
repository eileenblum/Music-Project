turn a deaf ear to all of
your
previous hearings so I can
tell you 
the truth...

here we come to defy
all we have in mind is us
and all the rest is refuse
so you can stay or turn
away

what's mine is mine
and hers is mine
and his is mine
and yours is mine
that's the fact

I can recall a time when I
was young and was
taught to do
what is socially
acceptable

such a shit receptable

well, fool, I don't know
about you
but I'm gonna get some of
that pie
that's cooling in the 
window

greedy circles of frenzied
sharks
bleeding teachers feed
them all
do you think I
give a fuck?!?

no!
no, not at all!
zero sympathy!
and what's more
motherfuckers
you can kiss my fuckin' ass
because
it makes me laugh...

all I've spoken is the truth

I may have said some lies
but
still I've told my truth
