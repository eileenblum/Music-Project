Did we persist in grief
Traces given for sinisters
Once delivered for their moods

No heaven over Germany

The afterthought was formed
And right below us
Outside of their fear
A perished generation
Among false idols

Only darkness in sight
Sins are remaining
I was not born...

Gone is the fog of war
Which invoke the final chaos
There was no light
Deadly final silence
For what is peace

No heaven over Germany
