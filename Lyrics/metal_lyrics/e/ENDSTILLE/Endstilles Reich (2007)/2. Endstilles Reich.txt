Carve the star into my arm
To be a part of the unholy fire
Escape from this world
A place of lies and false homage
I kill myself
To end my martyrdom
A last look back
At this cheated world

I cross the line
In order to find myself
A clean untortured place
I take my life
To dive into Endstilles Reich
A place where they honour me

My life ended
At the day I was created
I feel sorrow for this world
Full of stupid and sick humanity
Homage to the false
The true martyr
Be blind of your lies
Replace the truth

I cross the line
In order to find myself
A clean and tortured place
I take my life
To dive into Endstilles Reich
A place to honour me
