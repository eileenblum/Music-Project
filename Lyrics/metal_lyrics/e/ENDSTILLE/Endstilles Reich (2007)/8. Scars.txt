Completely unbalanced
The state of my interior
The values changed
Torn apart by losses

Scars which are never cured
Future uncertain
Hardened soul
Isolate my feelings

The sky will bleed
Actions atoned for
Punished through my hand
That carries the sorrow

The life - not recovering
The rage - moderated
The hate against God
Stirred up
