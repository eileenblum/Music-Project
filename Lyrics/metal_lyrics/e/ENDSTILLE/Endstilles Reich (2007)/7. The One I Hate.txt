Guided by the hand and lies of God
Reinforced by their belief
Like an ulcer
Which is malicious
A never ending illness
Which is called mankind

You're the one I hate
A swarm of plagues
A god-fearing mob

An illusion that makes you enslaved
The iniquities of your priest
Dependent upon the grace of God
Your unawareness disturbs me
Human fleas

You're the one I hate
A swarm of plagues
A god-fearing mob

Homage your holiness
The emperor of the light
Follow the blind one
Exploiting your belief
