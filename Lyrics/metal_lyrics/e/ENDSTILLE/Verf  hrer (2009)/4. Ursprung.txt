count of all beauty
missed inheritor
loss of horizons
need to repatriate

the hidden persuasion
it ever was
left a mark
alteration of roots

outer regimes attracting
inner diremption
no ones affiliation
purposed autonomy

yearning for glorious times - two lions and the nettle leaf
united forever eternally

self-proclaimed leaders
their overthrown pride
never coped the past - their defeat
...mortified!

intended deliverance foment emotions
a final decision
to end the alteration of roots

FOREVER!!!
