Here in the mud
I wait for the day to end
Silence so close

Like the fold of my childhood
My heart fills with memories of home
With warmth and security

In these shattered landscapes
Detonating the earth
Disemboweled my mind
Monotone senselessness

I will leave the field
This field of stench
As I'm sick of the dead
This inner manifestation
Is my desertion

Iron maggots gorge the flesh
I don't want to die
The inner capitulation
For nostalgia

Now I am here
Here in my cocoon
Everything is changed
And all is gone

Nostalgia,
Blood, sweat and puke
I pull the trigger...
And shoot!

Nostalgia
