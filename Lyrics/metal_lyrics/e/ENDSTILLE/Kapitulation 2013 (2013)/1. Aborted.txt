Far away seems the ambition of a new bliss
However depraved roots by militant compulsion

Passing by estates of the launched homeland
A look back, without belongings and faith
Open wounds, afflicted from severs cold and filth
Fester itself neat, like a booster detonation of death.

These victims of the eastern front collapse
100,000 dead and millions on the run
Overloaded paths and ad infinitum treks
The reds in the back, ready to overhaul the perdition

Passing by estates of the launched homeland
A look back, without belongings and faith
Open wounds, afflicted from severs cold and filth
Fester itself neat, like a booster detonation of death

In weiter Ferne, geplagt von Hunger und blutigen FÃ¼Ãen
Ist das Ziel so gewiss, wie die Furcht vor dem neuen Sein
Entartet, Enteignet, Entwurzelt und Heimatlos - Aborted
Gepflasterte Strassen voll Leichen, heimatlos wie wir
Ist dies eine Heimkehr in das wahre, ewige Reich?
[English translation:
In the distance, plagued by hunger and bloody feet
If the target is as certain as the fear of the new being
Degenerate, expropriates, Uprooted and Homeless - Aborted
Paved streets full of corpses, homeless as we
Is this a return to the true, eternal kingdom?]

Passing by estates of the launched homeland
A look back, without belongings and faith
Open wounds, afflicted from severs cold and filth
Fester itself neat, like a booster detonation of death

It sons lost, daughters abandoned
Disgraced for life, this stigmatized inner self
But as blue as heaven seems to be above
There is no Reich for security anymore
