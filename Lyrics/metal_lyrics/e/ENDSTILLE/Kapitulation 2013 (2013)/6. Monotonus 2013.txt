As they were marching, lead by the cross
A pledge from heaven, to manipulate the forgotten ones
Ecstatically murmuring psalms to get higher
An unnattural ritual, in the name of the holy trinity

Strength of mankind, broke by their voracity

Ostentatious sanctuary, their dead leader
Ascend the pulpit, pray the new world order
An uncontrollable fire in these starring eyes
Spreading the virus endless without faith

Defeat is unspoken
A grim propaganda
The essence of war
Is victory itself

Monotonus

Weakness of mankind, host of the faithful

The spiritual pestilence from the south
Encounters resistance from the shadows
A battle without retreat, the punishment begins
Till monotheisms end...

Defeat is unspoken, a grim propaganda
The essence of war is victory itself

Monotonus
