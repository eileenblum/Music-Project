They drooled for blood!

Break up and bleed for me!
Assault detachments on the run

Ardent tides summon them
To render an account
Of a dawn incautious sleep

How can they reveal?
While night still drowns the sun.

Break up and bleed for me!
Front by front let down...

Break up and bleed for me!
Assault detachments on the run

Not before the blistering this blistering blade fells off you
And you squelch yourself a boil
In front of glorious oblations on the cross,
You have not withdrawn you blameworthiness... In complete!

But live will abscond these unconscious sins!

Through poles they graze demoniac
Prophetic dejection drags them to the ground
Close the eyes for all,
Who once seeded these mistaken roots of clergy

This earth declines to its fate,
Refined and drowned in blood.
But do they stand beneath us?
Cleansed by fire of their oldest sins...

Doch wie Ratten weinen sie vor Hunger,
auf den HÃ¼geln unserer Toten
[English translation:
But like rats they are crying from hunger,
on the hills of our dead].

Receive this obnoxious anguish!
A call,
Which recedes you in an everlasting perdition.
Eternal perdition!
