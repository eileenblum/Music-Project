Call me a number, call me a sin
Your Adolf of Christ will never lead me

Who knows, that life isn't death
Or light not night
It all fades as we run in a lane of society

Even on this earth of desolation
In the sorrow life will bring

Even here I will not serve
For I shall be king

I'm the messiah, my own type of leader
As no life will ever break me
I'm sick of it all

Freedom pleases me, as I live anarchy
And peace with me, as I'm at war with all

So feel free to hate me
I'm sick of it - Sick of it all
I'm fucking sick of it!!!

Sick Heil!
