I entered the ship
Don't know where I'll end up

To an uncertain future
There is no hope left
My life, my heritage... disappeared

Expelled from my dreams,
My haven
A new flag on my ground

But my hope will glow,
Dolorous
If I reach the horizon

Now I lay here
In the depths of the sea
No optimism,
I'm alone
In my iron grave, so cold...

But my hope will grow,
Dolorous
If I reach the horizon

New memories arise
Deracinated, I flow away

Now I lay here
In the depths of the sea
No optimism,
I'm alone
In my iron grave, so cold...

But my hope will grow,
Dolorous
If I reach the horizon!
