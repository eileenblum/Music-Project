creeping devotional something
entitled, denounced
repudiated, but once loved
inferior to god

structured your own world
self-centere
raging inner flame
no comprimise!

there is no way back
to eternal love
wrecked is your life
... fucked god!

a cold heart shatters in emotional wastelands
radical lunacy
devoid sense

white snow is falling
salivate with pleasure
beatiful naked temptress
devastating erection

there is no way back
to eternal love
wrecked is your life
you bastard whore... fucked god!

inglorious declaration of war
you pathetic, lost soul
self-dispossesion
wrecked is your life
to eternal love
there is no way back

wrecked.
