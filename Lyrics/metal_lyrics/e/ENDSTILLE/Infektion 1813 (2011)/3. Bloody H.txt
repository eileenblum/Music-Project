[The Hurt-Gene]

The battle of HÃ¼rtgen along the Siegfired Line from 1944 to
1945 is one of the greatest myths of World War II. It was the
longest battle on German soil, known as well as the "Verdun
in the Eifel". The largest American defeat in Europe ever.
Even the official US-military history speaks of HÃ¼rtgen
Forest as a "black-green ocean of forest, in which HÃ¤nsel and
Gretel had lost their way".

Probably they found the Hurt-Gene here...
