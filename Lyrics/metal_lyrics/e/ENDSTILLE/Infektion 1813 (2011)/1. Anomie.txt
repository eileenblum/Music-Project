I cut out the persistence of time
unslaked hunger for life
manÂ´s got admirable moments here
perchance heÂ´s death so near

expressionism
formative ideal
"Gemeinschaft"
ANOMIE!!!

disillusioned image of death
agony of a new age
enrooted in a metaphor of war
like an endtime-occult shadow humanity

in dimension
once initial helplessness
an affliction of unlived affects

expressionism
formative ideal
"Gemeinschaft"
-Anomie-

the combat as an inner experience
anomic researched bunkum
a miasma of a corroded civilisation
if there will ever be
a new barricade erected
IÂ´ll greet the tempest of exaltation...
...with a bullet in my heart
