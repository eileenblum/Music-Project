there is a time in darkness
which fills my last hope
for a recent warmly light
an outcry from the deepest grounds of hell

I will awake our realm of this new age!

a mount of souls tower heaven and ennoble me
for the declension of sanity, law and fear!
no need for god!

here I canÂ´t find no peace.
this is a place I want to BURN! BURN!
set this world aflame!

once no day will ever annihilate this dream
you will arise once new... captures for a deride!
for I will never be reborn!!

no god with sense of grace
captured in the trace of pain
like paradise shall decay to deceptive gods
these lacerate flames fill my lungs
the ancient humanity converts its mind
as far as the cross draft its arms
this is no place for me to return

but sprouts decrease in the realm of this fading world

on a throne of grace erected by fire and ember
we will save this strayed child
so I set this world in flames!
