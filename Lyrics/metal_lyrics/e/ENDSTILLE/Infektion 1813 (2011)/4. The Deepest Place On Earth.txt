a place more hostile to life
blinded by darkness
a unique surreal situation
the desertation of life

this is the deepest place on...

into the nothingess
zero existence
IÂ´m the only one at the
deepest place on earth

salt in the air
mixes with the sweat on my skin
stagnant air fills my lungs
the sound of crushing steal

this is the deepest place on...

into the nothingness
zero existence
IÂ´m the only one at the
deepest place on earth

where did you lead me?
why did I follow?
whoÂ´s to blame?
myself or the enemy?
am I the only one
at the deepest place on earth?

the worst has come to the worst
but the worst part isnÂ´t over yet

hope is the last thing to die
and to die is the last thing to do, too
I am the only one
at the deepest pace on earth!
