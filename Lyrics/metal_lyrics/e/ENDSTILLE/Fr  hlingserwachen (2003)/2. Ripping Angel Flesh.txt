this pale face
falling down
marmoized skin
the broken wings
creature of the purest essence

slaughtered in the night
to trample the relicts of GOD
blast heaven
RIPPING ANGELFLESH

trinity has broken
uncontrolled orgy
sodomized the pure
onward to the hals of blasphemy

ashes we leave
the trace of hell
denying raping
the believe of the weak
with honour we embrace the silence
