Can you hear the name of God
Cutting through the room
Through others you move your tongue
Always through lies

Mankindâs secret lies
God is good when the life is bad
Iâm a child of God
He sends away the holy curse
When the light arrives

Born in Heavenâs kingdom

Lie! The only place for killing!
Lie! You fucking bastard! Die!

Youâll find our messiah gone
Youâll die alone
Our holiest ways forgot
When you stay with God
