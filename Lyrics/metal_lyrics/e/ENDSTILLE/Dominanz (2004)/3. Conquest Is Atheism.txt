Conquest is atheism
Delivered a thousand deaths
Exhausted is silence and harmony
Grieving pain, something fierce
Soul of the non-age

Based on the essential safety of God

The names of war
Religious intent
An inmost thought
And the blindness to follow

This is mans disgrace
But not the grace of God
The will to reign (eternal)
Known by reason of force
