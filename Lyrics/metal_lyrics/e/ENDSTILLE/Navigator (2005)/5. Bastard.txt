God
What's your meaning
Of living in your world
Between good and bad
Your orders I never obey

I'll never see heaven
I'll never be a part of you
I'll ever despise your name
I'll never show mercy to you
Fucking bastard

I'll never see heaven
I'll never be a part of you
I'll ever despise your name
I'll never show mercy to you
Fucking bastard

Bastard
Only another name for your existence
The void captured your light
The name of God we forget
Shall glow in Hell

I'll never see heaven
I'll never be a part of you
I'll ever despise your name
I'll never show mercy to you
Fucking bastard
Fucking bastard
