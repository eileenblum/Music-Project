Every dream, hellfires I see
In my mind he speaks to me
Every night I hear the call
Ever day I hate you all

I am of Satan's blood
I am of Satan's blood
I am of Satan's blood
I am of Satan's blood

Your God means nothing to me
I am of Satan's blood
All that's holy means nothing to me
I am of Satan's blood
This world means nothing to me
I am of Satan's blood
Your life means a shit to me
I am of Satan's blood

I am of Satan's blood
I am of Satan's blood
I am of Satan's blood
I am of Satan's blood
