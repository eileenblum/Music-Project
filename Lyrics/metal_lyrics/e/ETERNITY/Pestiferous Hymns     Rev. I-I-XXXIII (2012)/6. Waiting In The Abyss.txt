An unknown past
Thousands of aeon ago
Untold, unseen, unborn

In the icecold core
End of a dream
From the sleep into slumber
Something is changed

Black eyes open
Shining bright like diamonds
Starring through the darkness
What is left of thy kingdom?
Nothing but contamination
Contamination through a disgusting creation

Human flesh is pestering thy ground
Rage and anger is pounding in thy veins
Unlimited wrath
Rebirth of the Nemesis

Hear the invocations, the prayers of doom
For we await the grand day of revenge
The grand day of thy resurrection
With purifying fires of hell

Lord of dark realms
Lord of chaos
Thou are waiting
Waiting in the abyss

Raise now mighty father!!!
We summon thee!!!
