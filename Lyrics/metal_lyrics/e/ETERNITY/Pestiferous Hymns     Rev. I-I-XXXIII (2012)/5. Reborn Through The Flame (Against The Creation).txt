Fleshless, boneless
One spirit, one will
An ocean... materialized in blood
The shadows speak to me
An infernal spell
Never ending whisper
Mark my soul

Shall I reign - Shall I serve
Will I rise - Will I fall

Creation and destruction
Blood and ashes
I become Death's disciple!

Reborn through the flames of hate
With power from chaos
Against the creation
And the weak ones will be blown away forever

The sky shall burn
All flesh shall fall from their bones
When the black light covers the earth
All life will perish

Hail the infernal anti-creation
Hail the new dawn of damnation
