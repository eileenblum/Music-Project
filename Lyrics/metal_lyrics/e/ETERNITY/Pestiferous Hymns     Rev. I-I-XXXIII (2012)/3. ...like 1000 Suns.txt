The lid is open
The words escape
The fallen one will arise
In streams of blood and divinity again

For they will fear... Lucifer's return
With the light inside your hands
Enfold infernal wings
Brighter than 1000 suns

With the forbidden flame
Dazzle all who speak of lies
Dazzle all who create chains
And burn the temples of innocence

For they will fear... Lucifer arise!
With the light inside your hands
Lucifer arise in the black lights glare
Brighter than 1000 suns

For we give you the eyes
For we give you a throat
For we give you the tongue and the lips
Through our spirit awake again

For they will fear... Lucifer arise!
Arise and invoke the dawn of the damned

We praise the formless origin
The everlasting chaos
When all names will be like dust
In the ultimate nothingness
