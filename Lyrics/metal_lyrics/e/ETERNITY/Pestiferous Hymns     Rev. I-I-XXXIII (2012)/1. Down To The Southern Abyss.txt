Crawling under rotten thoughts
Infected by the decayed word
In the slime of the dying ones
Lost and caught
Alone inside the pack

Stop the whispering voice from above
Strip away the burning swamp
The will to breathe
The will to rise
The will to absolute power

Leave, leave now
Leave the place
Leave the time
All is behind now
But the dreams still punish

On the downward journey
Into the darkened fog
Into the stench of the unknown
Driven by the yearning
Down to the southern abyss
