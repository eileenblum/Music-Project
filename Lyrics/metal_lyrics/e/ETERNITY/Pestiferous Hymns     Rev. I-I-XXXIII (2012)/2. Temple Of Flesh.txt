My eyes are burning, ambers inside my skull
Like the lungs that inflame my chest
I follow the aspiration
The promise of deliverance
I strip the skin from my flesh
All hurts so well...

As I pass the gate
The call embraces me
Out of the sinful jaws
Flaming tentacles dominate
My guts are blistering
As I brown in impurity

Morbid carnality
A monument of temptation
Red altar prayers
Praise the icons of sin
Worship / Worship
Ancient whore of divinity

I bleed, I feel, I know
With reckless devotion
Deeper and deeper
I walk on flesh
I march through blood
On a stream of shattered souls
