Deathsound sounds life distant thunder
from inside the tomb
disharmonic are the dying
voices in the moon

At the time of harvest
he will tear the life apart
bloodsoaked is the rusty scythe
the reaper builds his art

Red wrath
is unfold
dead soul
numb with cold
and a call from hell
haunts my mind with spell
now is speaks through me
for his rapture let us bleed

Kill your father, Kill your brother
Kill your neighbour, Kill each other
Kill the whole humanity, Kill yourself
but first kill me
