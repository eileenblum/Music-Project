I could not take it anymore
all this waste in front of my eyes
disgusted by human civilization
I take a departure in hatred
I walk solitary through the snow
comprised from self-destructing mania
to heal me
of the sickness of humanity

My hands were bloody
because I tortured the enemies
pushing me to death
and so I wander... searching
with a rope in my hand
unbearable pain of living
through the darkness of the forest

The waiting for winter is over
eternal longing for this cold night
bewildered by the silence of nature
and the morbid shimmer of the moon
I searched for an ancient tree
that, since hundreds of years
carried with it all the living garbage
this was my place to die

My hands were bloody
because I tortured the enemies
pushing me to death
and so I wander... searching
with a rope in my hand
unbearable pain of living
through the darkness of the forest
