In the circle of living and dying
the single person is nothing
so small, worthless and unimportant
a gift for death

Offer it evil
it must always be present
for that is your key pure hate
pain and death is the end

You have to manipulate humanity
everywhere you can
blind and fool them
until a disaster is complete

Spot the weak 
decide him in his suffering
stab in his wounds
to the end of his existence

What is possible to your time
do it and even more
be unfair and intolerant
poison every peaceful atmosphere

One day it will be impossible
to control these negative thoughts
every day this rage fills you again
this anger of your sick ideology

You will accomplish
what you have always dreamt
and with your deed the circle
of living and dying is closed
