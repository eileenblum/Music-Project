I am
Since the creation of the universe
I am the darkness of night
I am in all
I am in the shadows behind the light

I am the will of 1000 powers
I am 1000 souls
I speak with the mouths of 1000 voices
I speak with 1000 tongues

I am 1000 blazing fires
All burn inside me
I am 1000 bestial demons
I am the pure unification of evil

I am the one within all
The one with 1000 names
I am the chaos of the cosmic order
I am the black nothing, the anti-life
