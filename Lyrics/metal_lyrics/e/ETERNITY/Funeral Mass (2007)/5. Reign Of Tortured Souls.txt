Behind the walls of life
Behind the shadows
Behind the light
Behind the reality

Extinguish the mask of the spectacle
Extinguish the bodies
Extinguish existence
Extinguish life

Gone by one's own hands
Gone in hatred
Gone with rejection of life
Gone with the rejection of mankind

The essence of hatred
The essence negability
The essence of rejection
Th essence of all morbidity

The wall is crumbling
The wall will break
The will to flood the world
When all the hate boils over

A thousand banquished minds
fused to one mass of antilife
and mankind will suffer for eternity
under the reign of the tortured souls
