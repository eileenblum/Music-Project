A bloodfilled silver chalice,
black candles on the shrine of darkness
We absolve the adoration of life
We absorb thy indisputable thuth
We'll extinguish the white saviour's countenance
from the face of the earth
We praise the name of the unholy one
The name of the horncrowed emperor

Profanation of light god's temple
Darkness wil prevail
Hysteria of the lambs
'cause the mourningstar will arise

This is the end of god's existence
Heaven lays in ruins
The aeon of thy infernal legions
is coming soon with determination
The bloodfeast is prepared
in the superior light of the burning house of god
The night of the bloody fullmoon
proclaims the return of the horncrowed emperor

Like a storm amongst the leaves
He blows away their hope
Like a blazing fire amongst wood
he burns their dreams to ashes
Like the wolf amongst the sheep
He slaughters the virgins and the innocent
He drinks their blood and eat their flesh
His majesty, the horncrowed emperor
