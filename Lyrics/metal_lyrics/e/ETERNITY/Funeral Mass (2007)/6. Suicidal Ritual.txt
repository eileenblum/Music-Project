Inside a burning circle...
...triangles of blood
about the baphomet
The ritual - the way of pain
To eternal wisdom

Iron hooks penetrate my skin
Blades of steel cut my flesh
Open my veins slowly

I've no control
The order of pain
I lose myself
I brift away

More than just a sacrifice
The key to the gate of knowledge
into the infernal kingdom

Pounding thunder from the abyss
Shadows dancing in my mind
I see the eternal fires of hell

My life is gone - I'm born again
