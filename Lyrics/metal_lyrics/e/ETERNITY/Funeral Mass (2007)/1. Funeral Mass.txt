(THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF HUMANITY FOR I COME TO DESTROY)

MY EYES ARE LOST IN EMPTINESS
STARRING INTO THE BLACK SILENT DARKNESS
I CALL THE FORCES OF CHAOS
FOR I AM THY DISCIPLE
I CONJURE UP THE FORCES OF DEATH
FOR I AM THY EXECUTIONER

UNDER THE ENDLESS NIGHTSKY
THE BLOODRED MOON ABOVE ME
I SWEAR, THE IRREVOCABLE OATH
BY MY BLOOD, MY SOUL AND FLESH
AND I AM THE CHOSEN ONE, TO OPEN THE GATES
TO THY INFERNAL DIMENSIONS

INSIDE MY FLESH A BURNING PATH
LKE THAT WHICH WILL BURN MY BONES TO ASHES
POUNDING THUNDER IN MY VEINS
MY BODY IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE
THE LAST AND FINAL EXAMINATION
IN HONOUR OF MY OATH

I AM THE NEW MESSIAH OF HELL
THE PRIEST OF MASSMURDERING PURITY
I AM THE SAVIOUR OF FLESH
THY PURIFIER OF THIS PLANET
YOUR FUNERAL WILL BE MY NEW SHRINE
MY NEW WORLD WILL BE YOUR GRAVEYARD
