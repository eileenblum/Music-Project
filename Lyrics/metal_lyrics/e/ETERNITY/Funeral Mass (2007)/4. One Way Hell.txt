I'm alone
In a room without any light
A calling, a screaming far away
A confused reign of dancing voices
feeding my insanity

I strangulate myself,
masturbate for the last time
I feel the blood drying
on my hands, on my face
I remember all the things
I've done the hours before

There is the final liberating climax
and with my sperm I spit
my last piece of humanity
hateful, in the face of the mankind

My final moment is near

I will leave this planet
The world, which was never mine
The gate opens, demons wait for me
I see whirls of fire and I know :
There is no return !

With bloody fingers I clench the trigger
The taste of weapon (is) on my lips
My hands don't tremble
The warm kiss of the muzzle

proclaims my end
and with my blood, the gun paints, laughingly
a grotesque picture on the wall

This is my last journey
On the way to...
.....hell
