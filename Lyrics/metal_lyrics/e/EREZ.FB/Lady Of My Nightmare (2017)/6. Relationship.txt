[Erez:]

This is going nowhere
I want to quit
But I won't dare

We can't escape this fate forever
But I don't care
You can not keep this lie

Our kingdom has begun to crumble
But you won't hear me, its too late!

To mend our broken ways
Go back to olden days
But still it burdens me
To leave this life you see

[Maria â Lady:]

But wait
I'm still with you
Our love is pure
And it will break through

We have to try
And patch this wound
I'll be your guide
To reveal the truth

Trust in us
And I know that
We can win

[Erez:]

Trying to burst off this nightmare
Living on each day with you
I'm giving all my strength and wonder
To stop the pain and follow through

But this is going nowhere
I want to quit
And I will dare!

We'll go our separate ways
Until the end of days
But still it burdens me
To leave this life you see

[Maria â Lady:]

But wait
I'm still with you
Our love is pure
And it will break through

We have to try
And patch this wound
I'll be your guide
To reveal the truth

Trust in us
And I know that
We can win

[Gilad Pearl: guitar solo]

[Maria â Lady:]

But wait
I'm still with you
Our love is pure
And it will break through

We have to try
And patch this wound
I'll be your guide
To reveal the truth

[David and Maria â Reality and Lady:]

Now go (It will break through)
And run away from this pain
(I'll be your guide) 
And soon
She will see it's all in vain
(I will reveal the truth)
It will hunt you
Throughout the universe (Our love is pure)
You will never feel her warm embrace!

You're lost!
