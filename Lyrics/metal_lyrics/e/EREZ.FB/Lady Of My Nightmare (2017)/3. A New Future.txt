[Bass guitar: Naor Alon]

[Maor:]

All alone
Standing theres
By herself
Staring at you

Gazing back
Can't you see?
Solitude
In her eyes

[Erez:]

Don't you tell me 
She will make me better
Don't you say we're 
Meant to be together
She is spoken for 
And the worst will surely come

[Erez: guitar solo]

[Maor:]

Going on your way
Alone another day
The endless price you'll pay
Without her

Turn to her and smile
She will show you it's worthwhile
And then you'll see
In her eyes.

[Erez:]

Yes, I know that 
She will make me better
Yes, I know we're 
Meant to be together

[Erez and Maor:]

Knowing her's an obvious destiny
I can see the future 
And love will surely come

[Alex:]

Brace yourself and tell her
You are restless since you've met
Don't rely on reason
You're confused and she will scare

[Erez:] Feelings deep inside me don't comply
[Alex:] Don't regress to madness
[Erez:] I think of her 
[Alex:] I trust that you will

[Alex:]

Try to make a better self with her
To be your very best
Take off your disguise
And a new future will arise

Try to make a better self with her
To be your very best
Take off your disguise
And a new future will arise

[Erez: keyboard and guitar solo]

[Erez:]

Try to make a better self with you
To be my very best
Take off my disguise
And a new future will arise

Try to make a better self with you
To be my very best
Take of my disguise
And a new future will arise

A new future will arise...
