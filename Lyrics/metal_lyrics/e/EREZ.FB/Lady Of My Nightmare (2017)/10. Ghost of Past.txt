[Erez:]

Staring towards the darkness
Right in the eye
Now I'm realizing
A grave mistake was done

I've known it for a while
But chose to
Disregarding
All of the omens
I'm doomed to run and hide

[Maria â Lady and Erez:]

(Run away) get myself to safety
(You will pay) I need to say goodbye
(For all you have done)

To leave this life behind me
(You're gone) I cannot stay and fight
(I am your ghost)
She's done playing tricks with my mind
(Of past!)

[Maria â Lady:]

You know I am here
I'll seek you to the end of the world
There is nowhere to hide
You're mine

[Erez:]

Escaping through all the universe
I need to find a place
To rest my head from all the sickness
Her poison's too intense

[Erez: guitar solo]

[Erez:]

I'm here
I'm all alone
She left me for dead
In exile, pain is my home!

[Maria â Lady:]

You're here
You're all alone
I left you for dead
This is your home

Your pain
Is what you've done to me
Again and again you'll see

[Erez: guitar solo]
