Bass Guitar: Naor Alon

[Erez:]

Missing all that time I've lost
My identity
Drifting like a trapped in soul

I feared my defences won't hold down
What is real to me
And twisted up my spirit whole

And I won't break down, if I am given just

One more chance
To try and break away
From this hideous life
And set my record straight

I deserve
An opportunity to see
How the universe
Unfolds its wings to me

[Idan:]

Come to us, my dear friend
And join us in our
Lively laughs and carefree world

And you don't have to fear
You'll be alright

[Erez and Idan:]

I can feel it's alive!
The world, it starts to revive!

[Erez, Idan and Rony:]

A brand new hope starts to thrive!
Prosperity will arrive!

[Erez, Idan, Ilan, Rony and Maor:]

One more chance
To try and break away
From this hideous life
And set my record straight

I deserve
An opportunity to see
How the universe
Unfolds its wings to me

[Erez:]

I can feel it's alive
The world, it starts to revive

I can feel it's alive...
