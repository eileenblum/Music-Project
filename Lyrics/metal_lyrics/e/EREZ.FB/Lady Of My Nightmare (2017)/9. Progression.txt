[Erez:]

I'm facing at a choice
To rid my life from all the sadness
In front of me I see two doors
To go back or to seize the future

The one will lead me to the past
When I had no one in my castle
The other one will do me right
And leave this rigid life behind me

How can I be sure it will be the promised land?
How can I beat this demonic creature on my tail?
How can I choose which path to go?
Pass into the future, I will thrive

I can't be lying down
I can't be sleeping now
I don't know what I've done

[Uri Mann: guitar solo]

Away from the times I've buried
I see it now
I feel it burning through my story
Of ages to come
And if I find a door to go back
To olden days
I can't be sure that it's not too late

The dream is right in front of me
I cannot let it die
I'm buried and I'm beat
I'm learning how to live my life
Without her I am high
And I will be complete

Racing at a course towards
A place that I cannot afford
To lose myself between the walls
Or find that I just can't let go

[Matan Matvey Milman: keyboard solo]
