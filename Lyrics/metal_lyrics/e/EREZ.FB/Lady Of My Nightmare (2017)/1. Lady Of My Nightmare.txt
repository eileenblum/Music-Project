[Erez:]

Lady of my nightmare

Couldn't understand
Why you gave me all you had
Shouldn't give it back
'Cause you left me alone and dead

Never thought you'd be so high on
Touching me and setting me on fire (Oh)
Once upon a time you've been my one and only

Lady of my daydreams
Stopping when my heart screams
Thought it'd last forever
But now we're not together

Lady of my nightmare

Took a while to sink
'Til my memory faded off
Needed time away
From this strange and peculiar world

Saw the other parts of hell
Found myself without no hope or new beginning
When I stayed up late at night
All I thought about was

Lady of my daydreams
Stopping when my heart screams
Thought it'd last forever
But now we're not together

Lady of my nightmare

[Erez: guitar solo]

But now I see you there
Riding on my shadow
Only if I knew the words
To set you free

Let me go...

(Coming into order)
(Turning all my anger)

Lady of my daydreams
Stopping when my heart screams
Thought it'd last forever
But now we're not together

Lady of my nightmare
