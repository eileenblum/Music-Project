[Erez:]

I am free to carry on
Living in this world alone
Can you see how much I'm drawn
To live in solitude?
It's the path that I have chose

Tell me what could I want more?
The world is knocking at my door
Tell me why should I need less?
I am here inside my safe
And I know, that it won't
Be forever, but I'm standing still in
My home-made castle

Soldiers bashing through my gate
Telling me that life is great
Selling lies and prize as one
To keep me satisfied
I won't hear them, it's too late 

To go outside and play
To seize another day
I'll find my way inside

So please...

Tell me what could I want more?
The world is knocking at my door
Tell me why should I need less?
I am here inside my safe
And I know, that it won't
Be forever, but I'm standing still in
My home-made castle
