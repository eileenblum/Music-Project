[Erez: keyboard solo]

[Rony:]

Counting the minutes
You spend all alone
Changing your outfit
Nervous as a storm

Chanting all the songs
You wrote in your head
Covering your skin
Not revealing you're actually dead

[Erez and Rony:]

Waiting anxiously
For the ringtone
That lights up the LED
On your (my) phone

When she calls
Your (My) face turns red
Hoping that nothing
Will be left... 
Unsaid

[Erez:]

As the night comes
The aching grows
Passing the time as it flows

Until we meet up
And feed the flame
Oh, I hope you know how you feel this day

I want to be with you
It's fun, when we're joined by glue
Embracing each other
You're making me think that you care

It's taking me in
Just like a drug
I cannot escape your love

You came down like an angel
From above
Can you feel it too
The ail inside?

When we're not together
Does your heart abide?
Because I can see through you
We will survive!

And while it's dark
I miss you more
Than ever
I am not sure

The time has come
To reach your soul
Show me what
You're dying for

I want to be with you
It's funny, the things you make me do
Embracing the feelings
I thought that I never had

You're drawing me in
You're just like a drug
I cannot escape your love!

[Ofir Lidor: guitar solo]

Why won't you reveal your feelings?
Can't you see I'm shedding
The shield from my heart

Defenses are down
Bombs all around
My mind is focused
On your sound

Don't you say it is
Just an accident
It was meant to be
Yes I know

One day I'm sure
You can make me see
These feelings we've shared
You're hiding them from me!

I want to be with you
I'm down when you're turning blue
Why won't you embrace what we've shared
And show me you care?

I took you in
Just like a drug

Can I escape your love?
Please...
