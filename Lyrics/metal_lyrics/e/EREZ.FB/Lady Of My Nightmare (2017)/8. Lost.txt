[Erez:]

The betrayal
There's no one
Not even friends

But I'm anxious
Going through
This wall of flame

Oh, just to make it
Oh, to reach your hand

All alone, I am crying
I'm screaming
Screaming your name

'Cause I just wanna see your eyes
All those days and all those nights
I just wanna be with you

'Cause I am lost
Without your warmth I can't go on
I can't stand a day without you
Oh baby, you're my only true friend

'Cause I am lost
With no one left by my side
Oh baby

Don't let me get lost!

Without you
My life abandons me
All my friends
They have no use to be

Oh baby
You're the only thing I see
And I know that it's over
When I see you
You're my dear (Oh yeah)

Only you girl
No, I don't want no more
Oh just to be with you

So I won't be lost
Without your warmth I can't go on
I can't stand a day without you
Oh baby, you're my only true friend

'Cause I am lost
With no one left by my side
Oh baby

Don't let me get lost

I don't know
Why can't I be with you
But deep down inside
I know just how
We'll make it true

Oh, just be with you!

[Erez: guitar solo]

'Cause I am lost
Without your warmth I can't go on
I can't stand a day without you
Oh baby, you're my only true friend

'Cause I am lost
With no one left by my side
Oh baby 

Don't let me get lost

'Cause I am lost...
