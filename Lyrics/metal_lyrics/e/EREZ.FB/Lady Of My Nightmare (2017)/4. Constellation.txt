[Erez:]

Seek me far and wide
Don't forget me
Look up in the sky
That's where I'll be

Stranded all alone
Without you I
Live among the stars
Floating in a tide of nothing

You could try to reach
But if only
You would only care
For the many

Souls I've tried to save
Just for us so
You could learn to fly 
With me in this

Constellation, up high
Concentration of minds
There's no barrier in here
It will touch you my dear

So won't you come and tag along
Give me strength to carry on
I wonder if you noticed that you love me

I saw you down there
My red angel
Dripping with his love
With the devil

Of my earthly dreams
Filled with pleasure
You're my treasure
Missing in this

Constellation, up high
Constant motion in my mind
There's a barrier in here
It separates us my dear

You left me here and all alone
Took my strength to carry on
All your feelings changed and you despise me!

[Erez: guitar solo]

He crushed you to the ground
Bounced you all around
Focus on my sound
I'll show you we are bound

For good, you only should
Trust me that I would
Rebuild your redded wings
Reconnect you with the strings

Of natural and grace
That came from outer space

From my own

Constellation

Constellation, up high
Concentration of minds
There's no barrier in here
It will touch you my dear

Red angel, you are here with me
Red angel, we are finally free
I've always known that we'll end up together!
