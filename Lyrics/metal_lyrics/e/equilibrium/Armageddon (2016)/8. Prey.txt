Straight across beclouded land
We're walking slowly at command
Feeling drained and without shield
To destination battlefield

We're getting near
Conseal your fear
Wipe off your sweat
There's no regret

You're erasing the light
No reason to fight
Remaining in state darkness
We insist on free will
No reason to kill
Decay of your own carcass

They are prey
Don't look away
Deep inside
You know that you are not right

Eye to eye, who's falling down?
Face to face, who gets that crown?
My doings are my legacy
Affecting all eternally

My intentness decays to sand
So I halt and raise my hand
I throw my blade out of range
This will be my day of change
