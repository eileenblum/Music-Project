I walk on fire alone
And still consider it's cold
I call volcanos my home
If they erupt I see gold

I walk on mountains of ice
And still consider it's warm
Right to the top would be nice
10.000 miles are my norm

No mission too hard
No challenge too big
Because I was born
Born to be epic

I fly in heaven so high
And still consider it's deep
There is no fear in my eyes
Around the planet I leap

I crawl to the center of earth
Deep down to find our birth
Faster I head to my goal
To spread my Rock'n'Roll!
