Waiting in the gray of dawn
Until the morning fog is gone
The leaves are full of nightly tears
Noises are on the way to my ears

Awoken from the sleep of death
I'm taking a deep intense breath
The bracing fragrance takes me back to life

Let's get forward, no time to rest
It doesn't really matter if east or west
So many roads are unexplored
The journey is its own reward

I feel it inside
My eyes are open wide
My heart will acclaim
The sun will rise again

I feel it inside
My eyes are open wide
My heart will acclaim
The sun will rise again

I feel it inside
My eyes are open wide
My heart will acclaim
The sun will rise again
