Standing where the moon glows through
A silent clearing, me and you
Surrounded by bright fireflies
I see the sparkling in your eyes

We have the light on our side
No fright no fear will now appear
It's our fate to push the gate
The unknown episode awaits

Breath of pine trees in the air
I slightly stroke red shimmering hair
One quick glance of you tells me
That you're prepared to turn the key
Deep inside the heaven's tent
The stars are shining with consense
So I will reach out my hand
To walk with you towards green land

We have the light on our side
No fright no fear will now appear
It's our fate to push the gate
The unknown episode awaits

We have the light on our side
No fright no fear will now appear
It's our fate to push the gate
The unknown episode awaits
