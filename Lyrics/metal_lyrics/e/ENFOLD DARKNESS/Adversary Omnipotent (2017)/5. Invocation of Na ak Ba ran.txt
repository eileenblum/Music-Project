[Ik'thran'ithul reads the invocation of Na'ak Ba'ran:]
"O come forth, thou who art the apocalyptic beast. I call out thy name and invoke thee!

O Na'ak Ba'ran, come forth and make thy presence manifest
With thy fires of truth, burn now asunder the veils of
Illusion and let now the dawning of the black light's timeless aeon commence!"
"They brought with them ancient magic of the goddess
Destroyed my obelisk and left my legions hanging dead
They threaten our rule
How then should I proceed, o fallen one?"
"Gather your best men
And intercept them at the ritual summoning
They willingly give you their locus
The lover will lead them into ambush"

"Tonight we march by light of moon
And we shall utterly eliminate all who would stand against the throne"

"NO! Bring Im'maud'hi alive

I have better plans for them. Banish them to the dark
Arrest the minds of the remaining betrayers
This will silence the rest

Thy reward will be great in hell"
