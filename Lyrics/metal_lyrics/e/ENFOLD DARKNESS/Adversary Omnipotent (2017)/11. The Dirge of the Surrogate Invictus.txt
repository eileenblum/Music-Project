"The Dirge of the Surrogate Invictus"

I am the ghost - the one besieged upon
The worst of lamentations
Mine - mine soul - fighting alone
Entrenched within this terrible war

This terrible war

Betrayed and left for dead
Our hero of vast wonders
Stabbed from the back and within
By the Harlot of Atrocities

"From where have I come?"
Our hero - he shutters unfurled
From the masses of regrets that build up through ages
Death - I can taste you on nigh

Glorious - He who absconds the true meaning
So glorious - to be the Surrogate Invictus
Glorious - He who absolves the true teachings
Victorious - you gore fucked, rotten whore

Keeping at once all the forms of lost teachings
With locks, bolted casings, and all
Utter blasphemitudes of a nefarious nature
So cold yet in darkness we walk

"The regrets of my time as all falls into line"
Keeping it within the Fold
"Of the five pointed star - pentagrammon beyond"
The ultimate magickal sign

Bury me as hopelessness consumes my mind
Keeping the story inside - of lecheries and betrayals in kind
"What have I become?"
A mannequin of purpose maligned
Bury me alive
Bury me alive

Glorious - He who absconds the true meaning
So glorious - to be the Surrogate Invictus
Glorious - He who absolves the true teachings
Victorious - you gore fucked, rotten whore

Keeping at once all the forms of lost teachings
With locks, bolted casings, and all
Utter blasphemitudes of a nefarious nature
So cold yet in darkness we walk

"The regrets of my time as all falls into line"
Keeping it within the Fold
"Of the five pointed star - pentagrammon beyond"
The ultimate magickal sign

And as darkness it crept - we wept in bitterness
For our fallen and shackled allies
Deceived from the beginning - our lives they had meaning
Now - they're shriveled and dead

"In a dream of futilities
With countless quests to embark upon
I will conquer all those who oppose me with penalties worse than death... as I crown myself as king."

An altered being of spiritual prowess
A slave to Lucifer and His commandments
Yet keeping my powers untold

"Deceived by the Prince of Maleficence and Woe
He bestowed upon me powers untold
But the cost accrued far outweighed my blessed life

With my powers in tow meant to destroy the world
I will resist this demon or djinn until told
To rest my weary head and simply die."

I stand before this precipice of the void - I stand and yell
Screaming forth all curses lent to me from the ascended ones of hell
Deception of my master's fate - I will surely send deathknells
I am biding my time - oh, victory - I shall obtain my Godhood now

The death of the King upon the Earth
