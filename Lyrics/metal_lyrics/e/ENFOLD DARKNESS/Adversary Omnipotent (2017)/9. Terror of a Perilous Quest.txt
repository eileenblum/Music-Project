Entrusted with deed to slay primordial beasts
That is my quest, that I may harness his dark design
To cut apex from the crown and join the artifacts
In perverse unholy union
With our might we shall arrive to save our world

It descended from heaven in smokeless flame
The dagger of ancients inscribed with the names
To aid in my quest to slay the elder beast
And to forge it's apex into the instrument of dreams

Into the labyrinth of Knossos we march
And descend into the bowels of the lower world
Half man and half beast
Unlike anything that had been seen
The hallmark of hell beasts within a dream

Now we prime our attack
Mounting surveillance
Our position not blatant
The perception of our magick magnified
Caused this beast to discover in time

Die!

And to the ground my comrade was pinned
Within it's grip in disbelief, could this battle we win?
Before it's teeth sank into the skin
My spell cast to his crown
It turned and relentlessly charged against me

Our spells used - now futile
Upon strength we must rely
Realized my only choice
Now with dagger in hand
The monstrosity it must die

My powers in tow and my visions aligned
To complete this chthonic test
The hostility of a vicious hell beast
That is the terror of this perilous quest
Though difficult it be, we shan't not concede
To the great horned beast that would rival my destiny

With fulfillment of deeds
Crown myself as king
Indentured to acquire the apex
Now dread has consumed us
Yet if I do not act it shall be us that will be entombed

This hour of danger has been brought before us
Upon my shoulders, on me the world weighs

Within the inner workings of my mind
The realization, blackest flames we shall bring to all mankind

My powers in tow and my visions aligned
To complete this chthonic test
The hostility of a vicious hell beast
That is the terror of this perilous quest
Though difficult it be, we shan't not concede
To the great horned beast that would rival my destiny

With fulfillment of deeds
Crown myself as king
Indentured to acquire the apex

Summoned forth from the black
An apparition appears
It allows us to escape

I mount the neck of the beast
And draw my dagger in haste
Soon the prison of the soul shall be erased

It's body flailing
And the blade raised on high
White knuckled, gripping it's head
A singular thrust to it's crest
For the monstrosity spells it's death

As it's body crumples to the ground
My dagger removes the sacred horn

It shall resound
