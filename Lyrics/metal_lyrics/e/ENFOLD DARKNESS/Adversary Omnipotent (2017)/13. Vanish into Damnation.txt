[Lyrics are by Greg Vance, James Turk, Elijah Whitehead]

In blinding flash of lightning
My home abandoned, seen
Legions in tow behind me
Burst forth through the seams
Discharged from the shadow
Manifest into the real

Bathed-in aethereal flame
Bodies spewed and slain
Piled in a bubbling mass
On the grounds of the Keep,
Ik'Thran'Ithul's forces laid waste

Resolute in my intentions
I rise to the forefront of the mass
First fists upon the gate
Our chants Dominate the airwaves

The gates, crushed and trampled beneath our feet
As we ascend the stairs into the fortress of the king
Our soldiers sing as their women, they weep
Whilst we cut down all the men sworn to his throne
Revered monuments of the hollow realm
Bathed in the flames of our furious siege
And our lord is pleased with our nefarious deeds
As we march to retrieve the Stone

Verily, I behold the Council of Six,
Prostrate before the Obelisk
Though their countenance has changed, surely driven insane
They awaken at the sound of my name

Lowered to the stage in angelic grace
Ik'Thran'Ithul appears, mask of fear upon his face
with my wife, the harlot, at his side
A revolting union I can not abide

Face to face with the Tyrant
I lunge in primal dominance
Impotent before my venomous hate
Reduced to broken form beneath my feet
Blackened blood and entrails cleanse my rage

As I draw the sacred dagger,
To claim his head as trophy
Rival gathered forces erupt
In frenzied slaughter

A zealous spirit of debauchery
Beset by malignant benevolence.
The stench of legislated morality:
An affront to freedom's purity.

Everlasting tortuous burning-
I hear their screams-
Fed to the fire.
Though obstacles appear at every turn,
My focus is serene, my greedy flesh burns!

A constant torturous yearning-
A desperate agony-
Poignant desire.
Though obstacles appear at every turn,
My focus is serene, my greedy flesh burns!

[Solo]

I retreat from the throng toward the hidden chamber
Reaching forth for the Philosopher's Stone
It's light that had dimmed from frivolous use
now revived from the stain of Ik'Thran'Ithul's essence
Call forth the Archons
Prepare the Gate
Call to mind the flesh
Of Naak Baran's awakening

[Solo]

The Stone illumined with every hue
Energy and matter coalesce
Split in half and rendered useless
Yea, Na'ak Ba'ran is manifest

Behold, the veil is ripped
The sour air erupts
In living flame
The apex of rapture;
The fulfillment of aeons.

The remaining living fall prostrate in terror
As they await his pronouncement;
The word of uncreation
The last moment to behold
There will be no testament

Angels and demons perish with our hearts
Serpent and Hawk devoured by Void
Emptiness, the sole victor
Soul dissolved in magnificent sorrow
Culmination of decades of disgust
Bitterness distilled to its noble essence
Burning eyes melt away

Behold the eve of extinction,
Punishing and unrelenting
All is silent as darkness consumes reality
The world is reset
