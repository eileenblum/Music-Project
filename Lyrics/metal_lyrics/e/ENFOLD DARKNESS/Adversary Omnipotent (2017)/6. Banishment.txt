The King and his court have
Discovered my secret powers
And truth of my ways has escaped the dark
And made it into the light
Calling for my banishment by wizard's fire

That day, on the fourth night
We were set to summon creatures from the abyss
But yet we were poisoned
For in our midst's there laid a traitor

All at once
We could not stop
The wards and snares of light
Caught surprised by the Royal Guard
The justice of our land
Fighting back we lost a brother to their magic spells
Weakened our powers we sought retreat
We had lost and were surely facing hell

Banishment

The first attempt of a golden dawn had been thwarted by ignorance
No truth of my ways will ever see the light
Only darkness of minds will be
Calling for my banishment by wizard's fire

Drug before his highness
We were martyred
All to keep himself in power
Now their works might be justified

Now within their clutches
They've assaulted us
To extract all information of our works
But of course
We won't be broken, no we won't be broken

Warriors united
Divided we shall fall

As we enter the halls of hypocrisy
My gaze is met with yet another
Master wizard
Whose name I shall dare not speak
He serves the throne

Torture will not work
The powers that be
They embrace, utilize pure mind extraction
Their Philosopher Stone glows as we enter the vault
Where I know they will surely cast us out to dimensions all but known
We've staved them off so far but we shall

Begin the dark process of their mind meld extraction
As my coven and myself
Our minds stand firmly as one
But over time my fears are beginning to be realized
As our magic
It dissipates

[Solo: Matt Brown]

Our time is short for we know that our life's works secrets
Discovered with and by their hands
We are done
Now faced with death I can see so clearly
We shall not escape this fate

I cannot bear this thought before me
That this is truly my end of days
The judge and jury of the Elder Council
Has sentenced us
Our time is now short

For the stone is now charging up
To dispel our spirits to doom
While our bodies will remain in a state
Of systemic fatal ruin

Artificial transgressions in place
Our powers are now null and void
For dimensional banishment has
Conquered us and delivered us into our prison

We were set to summon creatures from the abyss
But yet we were poisoned
For in our midst's there laid a traitor?
