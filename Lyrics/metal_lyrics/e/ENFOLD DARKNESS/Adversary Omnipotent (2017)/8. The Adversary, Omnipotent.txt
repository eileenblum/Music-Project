Drifted to the nether world
Slid from form to form
Unto the ethereal
My chance to probe the darkest secrets

By the fault of our enemies
Delivered unto our goal
By the fault of the greed
Of the paranoid king
His folly shall be his downfall

Forging through the mist and shadow
Searching for the one true ascended master
Calling forth the names revealed unto my ilk
(They are that of our spiritual guide)

For what once had seemed but only a dream began
To appear as real as daylight
O, arise grand deity, arise

He appeared as The Accuser but he called himself God

"I am the God of the unseen and known
Fall before and worship me with faith unquestioned
And allegiance
Offer me your darkest malfeasance
Keeping me within your heart

I keep control upon the earth
My slaves they disavow the serfs
And as they pray to me
My powers grow

Keep me in your heart,
I'll reward thee with the loftiest
Pleasures of the flesh
I'll reward thee
Keep me in your mind
I'll reward thee with a keen intellect -
That would rival the divines

Keep me in your blood,
I'll reward thee with transcendence
That would rival the anointed
Keep me in your deeds
I'll reward thee supremely
I'll make you king of all

Bereshit - the word was spoken
Send forth the illusion to enslave

By my wisdom the world was made
The word is none other than thee

I uttereth clearly unto thee,
The word is falsehood - the understanding darkness

It is written, for these are times of darkness
And this as a lamp therein:

With the Dagger, destroyeth he
With the Chalice, preserveth he
With the Sonus, redeemeth he
With the Apex, createth thee

With the Dagger, destroyeth he
With the Chalice, preserveth he
With the Sonus, redeemeth he
With the Apex, createth thee

Thee shall behold!
Accumulator passed unto me
Within its sphere, the essence of the word
Brak'tal O'minn - O fallen one
we shall fulfill and end the illusion!"

His powers before me and the world behind
I'll take the given quest - we shall rival the divines!
Unto the earth - give the fallen ones rebirth
All will know truth, as we restore the nature of the word

"If the truth is what you seek,
Come my dear child and follow me,
Realize now that this is no dream.
Behold! The Adversary speaks!"

"Thee shall be god, now seen and known
I've given thee my instruction
Keeping me within your heart

My armies to thee - if my word thou shalt keep
O harbinger ov destruction

You shall be crowned king
If the quest is complete

Earth, as black as sleep before the dream, the true awakening."

Constant but ever fleeting
Answers come with no context
Or meaning

Both the darkness and the light are blinding
Both paths: narrow and winding

Our perception limited to grey in between.
Only to blithely proclaim
Reality as only what's seen.
All are we, am I?
By imitating grand design.

My gnosis reduced sensitivity
To the framework of eternity
Release the feeble grip of flesh!
The faltering hand of the withered mage
Left the last work undone
