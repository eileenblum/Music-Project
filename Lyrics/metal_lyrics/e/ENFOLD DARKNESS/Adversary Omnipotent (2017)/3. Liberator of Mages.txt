Hundreds of thousands of ages have passed
Since the dawn of the Sali'un
They had given the gift of the white magic
A resource to the lesser kin
Which had uplifted them from the welk and the desires of evil men

Yet a dark shadow arose from the east
Their purpose settled in blood
A war faring folk with technology
Able to diminish the powers and control the
Mind of the mages - they had become weak

A child is born
Under the sign of the morning star
The catalyst of prophecy
Im'maud'hi - Rise and restore the nature of the word

And like the great beast, they came from the sea
Legions of men chartered by the evil king
Come to destroy the
Land of the ones unamenable to he
And to murder the golden son of the old prophecy

They set fire to the homes
And salted the fields
Raped the mothers and daughters
Shed the blood of the men
Enslaved their sons
And stolen their wealth to do Ik'thran'ithul's will

A great presence had overtaken one of the guard
"This child is mine, now save him and take him afar"
And so they erected their obelisk
Claimed the lands for their own
But the son of the morning
Had been given a new home

Seven years had come and gone
The boy safe in his new home
Unawares of his past - Everyday he would ask
The questions that answers would never be known
And his days were spent learning the tongue of the king
Tending the fields and taking up sward
He was destined to be in (the) Narcillian army

In the midst of the night
An apparition appeared before he
Materialized from light from the hearth
The boy startled, fell to his knees

Then the master extended her hand
"The powers of ancients are yours
Go now learn with these tools"
Reached out with her palm and touched his head

Now gone - sailed away in whirlwind of shadow
The creative force withdrawn to the realm of the unknown

Disease had spread o'er the flock
And the folk had fallen in despair
Without knowing, the boy healed all
And raised the dead fowl
It's stench wafting through the air

Many witnesses came to bear testimony against the boy
Necromancy, unknown to the people, yet punishable by death
Would be his fate without intervention from the ones who know

At last he had been made known of his story
His past, once blackened now brought to light

Ostracized from his town, destiny to overthrow the crown
And restore a new age of light to his kin
Left to focus his craft, a lone mage on the path
Banished to the wilderness to discover the light of the imminent dawn
