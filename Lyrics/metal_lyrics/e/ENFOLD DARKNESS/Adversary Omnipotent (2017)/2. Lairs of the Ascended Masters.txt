Amnu Na'ak Beru - Na'ak Ba'ran!

Hail the victorious
Of a once exalted throne

Brak'tal O'minn and his powers that I've gripped through his talisman
Ik'thran'ithul, and his kind, they shall pay (and be slain)
By my hand, as we assert our dominion on this earth

Seized into a dream of our world

Under disguise through a guise of lies
Just to keep them docile
But we escape these fools
In the lairs of the ascended masters

Behold the tome of the ascended zones
It is the gate of forbidden keys
Of a mind of the highest design
Resisting death - I alone will live the
Test of time to assume my throne

Seized into a dream of our world
Seized into a dream of salvation

Under the skies as my portal does
Slide from the trace - disaster
But I show these fools
As I destroy all the fucking bastards

Quicken the decimation of the slaves
We're sent to lead astray from truth
And the sacred magic

The of their sacred masters

Pain

The power of dark light
Their contrivance - my foreordination!
Hell shall be unleashed as our armies
Are unsheathed
The elder council - they face extinction!

And now - orgone, it activates the sonus
Apex doth sound
The gates shall be flung open

Now come to me
Feel my pain
Suffer in my world
Brak'tal O'minn!

Once lost, with no path
A new order will assume the reign

And with one drop of blood
Added to components conceived
I will reconstruct my body
With aid of unholy trinity

And as we accost the holy temples
Of the Sali-un Umm'thraba
We shall bring to the earth, the blackest flames of hell

Back on earth physically reborn
Again
I'm here to start the war
Of a mind of the highest design
Resisting death - I alone will live the
Test of time to assume my throne

Seized into a dream of our world
Seized into a dream of salvation
