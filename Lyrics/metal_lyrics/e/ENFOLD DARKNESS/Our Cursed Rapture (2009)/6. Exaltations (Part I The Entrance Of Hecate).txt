Bring death from the bastions beyond and envelop their life force
Their sins - so timeless, indeed - are of no concern to me
Suffer through the mist to forge your will and the world will surely come
Our hour of triumph arrive

Before my eyes the sky caved in as the world fell cold
Many died but some worldwide managed to survive
We murdered the rest
We toiled for no less
We sought to watch them burn

[Solo - Mike Low]

Stage two - the radiation ensues - while the whole of earth's surface is ashed
The presence of an evil force unmatched
We came to end all life and then some
We came to steal theirs souls at last
O' come forth Hecate - give unto me
All dark powers and glories brought forth from the deep
We do your bidding with demon speed

Exaltations from the heaven's to thee
We are the prophets of dire
The foretold wretches - the blackest disease
Feel our tortures burn as you fall into darkness
We came to watch them burn

[Solo - Mike Low]

Like slaves we made them toil all across the bitter soil
All the while we watched as they descended into our home

[Solo - Matt Brown]

The author of life - he did abandon
His lot, his herd, all of his sheep
Left to the wolves brought forth from darkness
Black angels all fallen
In death
