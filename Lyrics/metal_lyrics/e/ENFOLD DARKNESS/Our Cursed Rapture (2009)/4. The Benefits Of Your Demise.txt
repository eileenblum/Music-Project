I can feel it come again
As it passes over longitudes upon the western wind
Memories of atrocities past and some to pass ensure
That our foretold yet kept cult sect endures to the end and brim of time

Go forth and cast your nets into the seas of acid
Diverged are thee from the path that was once set righteously
Nature turns their blackest hour
From the seed that did breathe the feign of life into the Vatican
A veiled wonder soon followed in search
Of the deed of the tree of life and other things to quench it's thirst

Our virtue lies in the sacred ties to the black rebirth
The benefits of your deconstruction of bone and flesh
The first step of vile and horror endured
Handed down from the crown of good it's life's counterweight
To thine end we shall pack one full
And as we twist and pervert the set rules of the hallowed set
He climbs to eclipse the world from the sun
Worship me, fall on knees, proceed with the deed
As I cite them one by one

The monstrosities (They were heaven sent) served to removed the scourge
A cancerous parasitic life not to be preserved
The putrid stench of the fallen man
It lingers (Oh so suddenly) now a dirge will be served
To greet and ring the end of life and hallmark it as the fit ensues

As the curtains fall signaling our time to climb
My ear fell on utterances of a fallen kind
Seven thunders roared beckoning I cast lies
To write that the seven said, untold now for all to hear in time

Cast aside your fears for the end is on the neigh
Do not cast blame for the fault of your demise
The religions of this world seek to taint the guise
And corrupt all souls who bear the need to find
Inner solace reels and solemn potency lies
All resolves into the benefits derived
Life's purpose reels and the need for death guides
All dissolves into the benefits of your demise
