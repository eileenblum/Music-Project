Helios - Guide me by the sun 
And with east and west geometries a trance will now be spun
Devils from past hells perceived to be one
But not by man, aman, his clan
Now our fates will sauce their tongues

From the east past the herald gates - for months and months their heels would batter and break
As they passed over great lengths seize my spell in the galleries of the utmost evil
And then at last its talons grew straight out from the earth itself

The truth of all forgotten things too horrible for thought or mention
And now the churning death from depths abhorred is found
His fervent duty unleashed with hate forever will resound
In the mind's eye until the end of days - concurrent with what they've found
His spires of power and citadels of wrath
Of hidden poison wrapped in mounds

Like Apollyon's dark path - these harlots of lost dominion
Apart from his kind - now in and amidst the sights of wonder - The bowels within
Of a prison long forgotten that scoured the earth in the hearts and minds of men
As Moses received our will from the tree
This ignorant disciple will to scour the earth for a time and time again

[Solo - Matt Brown]

Now go forth - bring hell to all lost souls like Thebes
Decimate and raze the land as you choke off life - foul leech
The human race will do anything to murder itself and to poison life for me
At the cost of my cult
