Old ghosts from the past
Their shadows in my head
So many years have passed
And now the wind blows again

Trying to go one
Don't look back this time
Sleep on the silence
Covered for an ice shell

Let me hear your voice
Feeding my deepest wishes
Sing these sweetest notes
Blow away my senses

I can't read your feelings
Maybe they are not the same
But I'll climb this ancient mountain
Only to see how deep can I fall

Like a grey feather
Flying under the moonlight
I'll wait for the moment
Of my early years fantasy

Let me hear your voice
Feeding my deepest wishes
Sing these sweetest notes
Blow away my senses

Take this lonely soul
Erasing old visions
Let me hear your voice
Feeding my deepest wishes

[Solo]

Let me hear your voice
Feeding my deepest wishes
Sing these sweetest notes
Blow away my senses

Take this lonely soul
Erasing old visions
Let me hear your voice
Feeding my deepest wishes
