Alone, for having committed a crime 
Lost in time 
My path to eternity 
Why?... my destiny. 

Iâve been searching till my last breath 
A way to warm my cold soul 
If only I knew where 
If I could find you. 

A body without a soul
A spirit without a song 
A poet who has lost everything 
Why?... my destiny. 

But my life will last forever 
My pain will be with me until death 
I only need to warm my cold soul 
If only I could find you. 

Come and get me out 
Of the darkness where I am 
Take me to a place where my soul finds peace 
Come and get me out 
Of the darkness where I am 
And make me dreamâ¦ away from here. 

Dark desires haunt my spirit 
And drown me into a deep ocean 
Take my fantasies and make them real 
Free my body from this hell
