The moon is witness of our nights 
I never imagine your eyes; 
Beautiful loneliness 
Thousands of tears the stars cried 
Making the most beautiful rose 

Echoes from your voice 
Are my heartbeats, listen to them 

I saw in your eyes the hell 
I transformed it into love. 
In your eyes I see loneliness, my loneliness. 
I saw in your eyes the hell, 
Transformed it into love 
We are only one. 

I raise my glance towards the moon, 
And ask the gods a place between them 
Itâs my wish to be with you, foreverâ¦ 

Echoes from your heartbeats 
I will in your soul 
I will lift my dreams to the heaven, 
Your eyes glow in each of them
