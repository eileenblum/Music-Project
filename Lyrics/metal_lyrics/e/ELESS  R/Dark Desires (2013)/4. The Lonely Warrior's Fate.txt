Crossing a valley...
All I can see are some trees
and a hundred of men slayed
by my legendary sword

Not just for king's orders
Not just for earning money
I feel like this is the only
thing that I'm good at...

I saw you there
How can I forget the moonlight in your eyes?
Aren't you a myth?

Valkyrie, May I be worthy
of fight alongside you for all eternity?
Valkyrie, could you be the one
Who will free my soul of this misery

The souls of the brave
May have a chance to be saved
The goddess of death
Takes the chosen within her

The greatest honor
What every hero is waiting for
To be chosen by you
Is why Iâll die for
