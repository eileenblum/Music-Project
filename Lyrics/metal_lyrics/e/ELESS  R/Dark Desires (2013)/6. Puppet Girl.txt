Sweet puppet girl
Donât go away from me 
Sleep under my nails 
Your strings belong to me 

Tonight I longed to see you 
Falling from your heart 
Come to me today 
Donât cut the strings that hold me 

Tell me why I am your slave 
Tell me why I belong to you 
Tell me why I am your slave 
Tell me why I belong to you 

Underneath this sea of pain 
I felt nothing inside of me 
Sunk into my only you 
the only thing I need 

Now your dreams failed 
Your life is mine 
Now is time to see you in pain 
Your strings on fire, belong to me
