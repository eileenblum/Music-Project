That will take us to our own death 
And dig our own graves. 
Cus that will take us, together	
And weâll be only one 

And now it seems there are 
no more ways to improve 
Cus we lack of freedom	
To decide for our lives 

Cause we allowed that other 
To do it for us 
Cause we feel fear in this time 
Cause we allowed that someone 
To do it for us	
and control our lives 
We change, or We Die. 

Waiting for a salvation 
Trying to find the guilty 
Of the sick Human situation	

While we do not realize 
That itâs a society 
That clings to hatred, greed and fear 
As a way of our own manipulation
