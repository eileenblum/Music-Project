From far away lands 
between mountains and white trees 
I can't stand the cold in my heart 
Who will set me free? 

Dancing in the snow 
Like a fairy from a tale 
I can feel it right now 
the cold is fading away 
What is awaiting for me? 

You came to me, you stared at me 
you melted away all my fears, my frozen tears 
I wish that someday I could make you feel 
the same you made me feel tonight 
My queen from far away snow lands 

"Everything in life has at least two points of view 
don't make a mistake, your life is the price , don't 
believe everything you see..." 

"A hunter and his pray, a lover and his maid...what's the difference? It depends on what you see..."
