Hearing thougths 
About how is supposed to be 
I resist the destruction 
of personal qualities 

Comes the night and in my eyes 
a new world is borning 
Poetry in action 
but they say 
itâs only rotation and translation 

A wolf is getting me nowhere 
drinking my blood 
killing myself 

Common sense 
Or good sense 
Social convenience 
or control system 

You just need to keep alive 
your own being 
kill the wolf of ignorance
