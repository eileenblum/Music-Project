Look into my eyes 
And see your future inside 
What is awaiting for me 
At the end of this road 

I have always been afraid 
of losing things that I don't have 
those things that make me feel 
like Iâm just what we are 

In the sky, in the wind 
I can see, I can feel 
that Iâm not the one 

I knew it would finally come 
the day to make a choice 
you've always been the answer 
and this time... 

In the sky, in the wind 
I can see, I can feel 
that Iâm not the one 

I knew it would finally come 
the day to make a choice 
you've always been the answer 
and this time... 

To see what I've always dreamed 
I'll do anything 
The only thing that means something to me 

To see in your eyes 
That you finally have 
what you can't have with me 

All I can leave you is this
