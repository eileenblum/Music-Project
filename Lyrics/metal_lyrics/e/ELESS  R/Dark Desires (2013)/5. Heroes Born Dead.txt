Thinking and feeling 
Brilliantly for their time	
Maybe someday 
Somebody will understandâ¦ 

Most of the time 
Undermined by the majority 
Unable to demotivate 
Them through their strange ideas 

Running nonstop 
Although the winds blow hard 
Living nonstop 
Although their lives are against them 
Running nonstop 
Although the winds blow hard 
Fighting nonstop 
Even knowing the end. 

The flowers lie in their graves 
Dead and forgotten by their uselessness 
But the souls of these men 
Are beyond time 
And now, people can understand 
Heroes born dead
