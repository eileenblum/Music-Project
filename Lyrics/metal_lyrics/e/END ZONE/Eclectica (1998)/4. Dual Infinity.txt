Cosmic sight
The infinity
Cold starlight
Of galaxies
Is it real
That someday we will
Reach that far
And discover more myriads of new stars?

Raise a handful of sand
In a desert immense
Count all grains in your hand
Does it make any sense?
Senselessness lies
Where there is
Absolute End
There is no end
There is no source
One of these grains of sand-
Our infinite universe!

Microlife
The infinity
One will never see
With naked eye
I suppose
Someday we'll disclose
Secret ways
To the endlessness of molecular space

Raise a handful of sand
In a desert immense
Count all grains in your hand
Does it make any sense?
There is no end
There is no source
Maybe each grain of sand
Is an infinite universe!
