[Epigraph:]
"Destiny is not a matter of chance.
It is a matter of choice.
It is not a thing to be waited for-
it is a thing to be achieved.
William Jennings Bryan"

A question fades
In the stillness of the air
I have to seek
The answer by myself
What if I don't?..
What if I quit?..
Life is a game
I'm the misfit
There is a scar
Cut deep, too far
Beyond my flesh
On through my soul
Lifetime dividing gash
Ten thousand dreams
And miles away
There's my lost yesterday
A peaceful flow
Through days... and maybe years
Among the thoughts
Of how it could have been...
If I was there
Back then again,
Was unaware
Of any pain
Day after day
It gets harder
To bear this scar
And overcome this depression bizzare
I close my eyes
And wonder why
Someone does not give up
A remedy-
The healing power
Is it really in me?..

[Post Scriptum:]
The idea for this song came after the tragedy that befell Jason Becker.
To the authors the way Jason treated this terrible SCAR is the clear example
of how a person, a human being DOES NOT GIVE UP in the face of earthly
misery and chooses to go on strugglingonly with the strength of his will.
This is indeed a choice to be respected. The authors would like to address
this song to those making their final choice of life and death.
