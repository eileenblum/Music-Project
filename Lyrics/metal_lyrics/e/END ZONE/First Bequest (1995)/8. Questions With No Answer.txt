Questions they tear my head apart
Answers somewhere beyond the reach
Questions rise again
Arousing the doubts
The mortal way of life
Imposed upon us all
Is that our own device?
Can the faith in Super Beings
Excuse all human lies?
From the very first step that we take
We are a part of this strangest play
We're only watching our precious lives
Forever slip away
While lacking the strength
To face our weakness
Dare we take a chance
And take control?
I have had enough
So leave me be
I`m tryin' to understand
Why we can't be free
Of weak in ourselves
Roles we started playing once
Upon a time - will never fit the rhyme...
