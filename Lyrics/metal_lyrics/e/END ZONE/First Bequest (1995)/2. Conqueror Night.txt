Welcome inside this coil,
Mortal and proud, complicated gear,
This diligent sweat smelt black toil,
Barren and vain in it's petty fears
Night comes down and captures them all... fall!
Now in this noiseless dark air
Sparks are glares and rustles are dins
While the warm wind is swaying my hair
A fright inauspitious begins:
Here, under this omniscient still,
Something intensely grows-
No sound just thrill
Night- bird of prey who gazed below
In menacing shape, savagely
Up on an eminence, quickly saw
Prey that slept in it's fantasies
Then apace
Domineering one
Finished the chase,
Exulting in grim fun
And flew to let the sun...
Daylight gifted the rays of truth
Rushing suddenly like a flood
All the fowlers knew none of course
They saw no traces but the blood
A trifling, trifling epitaphic loss
For those protecting life
And for those,
Endless those who raise the Christian Cross
Against Conqueror Night
