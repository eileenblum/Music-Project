The dark
Fell down before my eyes
Bright pictures of reality
Are disappearing slowly
My mortals burning glance
Is harmless now
The power's fading wearing off
I'm so exhausted by this strength
I can bring them pain to suffer
I can make them kneel
They will never be able to see
Core of danger, seed of evil
Soul destructive gift
It is mine until death comes
There's nothing more to argue on
I doubt no more now
My evil gift with all its power
Stabbed in my back
(Is back on me:)
Through time I'm travelling
Back to the moment of my past
When I got mightiness
And learned the secret wisdom
That passion fooled me that is clear
For through this evil might
Inhuman life of mine
Has been approaching its deadline
Wilful ardour takes me slowly
Devilish grin appears
Go to hell with all your sweet salvation
Now I crave to dive into a
Flow of human tears
Who can accuse me for being me
This dark infernal might I won't hide
I hate you all, this life, this light
The time is ripe for me
There comes the final stand
There comes the end
Get ready, fools, to meet my glance
I'm opening my eyes:
