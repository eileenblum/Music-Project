We have both bared witness to the truth but our origins suggest otherwise
Holding us down, for the otherâs view is incessant
Paving a way of disbelief that fractures the core
And leaves us the opposition to the things that make us whole

Our motion is relativeâ¦

Bring me one step closer to feeling your pain, for I cannot replicate
The process that has made you who you are today
Would you do the same for me?

Instead you seem to bind my words with something dispassionate
As if all of this means nothing
Filtering out everything
An affinity for us to disagree

Do you see the gravity?

Go into another dimension to isolate yourself from the views (x2)
For the truth only resides in the eyes of your kind
Even if the rest of the world were to wait for eternity

To see the other side

To see the other side of life, out of context from your predisposition
You cannot believe what you see but the view is clear from here
And I know youâll feel it when you get there
