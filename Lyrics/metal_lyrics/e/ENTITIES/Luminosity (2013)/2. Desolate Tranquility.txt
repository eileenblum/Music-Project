Contain the self and stay away from every instinct that compels you
Become the vessel that maintains a sense of dignity before you break the silence
This has been a falling out of apprehension, a noble voice without a thought of why they spoke ahead of their intentions
There is no way to progress from these attractions, forfeit the act youâve lost the right, destroy the will to speak your mind if you canât handle it
Why not take the time to stabilize the inner desires
I thought you had the interior that supersedes this
Embrace what you lack and grow from the unknown, a simple concept of patience
Observe and learn to place faith in man, for he is the only advisor that this world has to offer
The negligence has brought this affliction; resist a common law that should guide us all
Iâd rather be the etic in this aggregate of unfamiliar faces then to be the attraction
Well aware of my being, I can actualize perceptions from the ones who will deny me
This is the end of the jury, I cannot take these inspections, rise above the hate and step away from the masses, from within I can hold myself down without interaction
The ability to look past the things that displease and control the emotions, which crush our dreams, is the final frontier of reaching this solidity, an ideal release of strength to break us free
Never again to be fazed by anything, we will stand back and gaze as the rest of them fight to stay alive, remaining unspoken our conflicts have now deceased
