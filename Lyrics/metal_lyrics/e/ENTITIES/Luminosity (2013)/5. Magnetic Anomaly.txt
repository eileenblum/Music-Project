We are torn apart by this effort to reach authority
And yet the illusion of power guides us towards hypocrisy
There are ways to decrease disorder; remove this isolation from holding us back
We must increase this interaction
Although it rarely manifests into anything more then an altercation,
It is the only thing that we have left
This infrequency to be in touch and always leaning towards the other side of life they know we canât believe
An anomaly that binds the difference between beliefs, it can make the tide become reality
Where are all the words that will insure our merge to this new society?
It is a place of prosperity
Lets make it known so when itâs cold, thereâll be a sense of unity
I never thought that we could build a lasting bond of community
