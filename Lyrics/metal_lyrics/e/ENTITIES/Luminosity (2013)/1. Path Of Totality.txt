Our lives are so bleak; we must enhance the human condition
An altering of genome that surpasses the threshold
The line that separates us from divinity
Forget the past and all of its fallacies
So break the laws of humanity
And share reciprocity with the inanimate,
It will take us away

With all these man made delusions and untenable claims,
A vice to be expedient
We need a spark of ingenuity to silence them all
To prove that we are the creators of our own destinyâs

The age of false prophecy is obsolete, efface the eulogy
And become the voice of rationality that choose to speak
Of obtaining the knowledge of gods

This is a glimpse of reaching infinity
Weâll be the ones who construct reality

Weâve always thought that our answers would
Bring us transparency
Deny that change is the process that will set us free
Defy the steps of obtaining totality
Why would one decide before we see whatâs real

It is a certainty that we will transcend
From these beliefs and look at life objectively
This is the dawn of a new propagation
The progeny that will bring us peace
