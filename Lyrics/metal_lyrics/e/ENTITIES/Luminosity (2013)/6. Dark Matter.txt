I am bound on translating this form of illusion
A series of lifeless misdirectionâs
Force me to place faith in words that serve no expressions
This emptiness, a void with intentions
Takes me to a place that one cannot relate
Where the light is dim and depravity calls

I hate the feeling of this aggression,
But the patterns displayed here are more then controversial
Theories attest this absence, prevailing as minor in advancement
Falling short of what hides beneath the confines,
A mind lost by its own will to rise

Look into this abyss, where we find emotions that wait
And prey in hopes of attaining some recognition
That fills the chalice only half full,

Why is it that every moment must be crushed by this disdain?
Is there a way to subjugate these repressed memories?

I must be losing focus from these pressures outside of my own mind
External factors weaken my senses, bringing hostility into our lives,
I hope itâs evanescent
What is this need to be above everything?
I never wanted this barrier, but your thoughts are so god damn callous
Remember that if you fall, Iâll be the one with open arms to save you from the collapse

Before you leave and forget me, just take the time to reflect
On the images that you have portrayed, before we fade away
