I swear I thought this dissolved but you have brought back the vision
The words Iâve said but cannot recall, absolved through the rampant illusions
Where do I stand today? Iâm at the mercy of your frame of mind,
Provide the clarity I need to hold stability

I think Iâm torn between the space
Of truth and lies, the gap is blurring to the point of obscurity
Has the storm passed us by or just the start of a silent dissension
How timeâs flied, but yet I feel so nostalgic inside, I that wonât forget this,

In due time despite the fights, I want to see this all come through
We have come too far to break this down
In due time despite the fights, I want see this all come through
Stayed up to many nights only to realize this fantasyâs not real

Crushed within, my life is a sin, nothing can ever redeem me now
I have swallowed my words and stepped away from this, wonât interfere with the risk of a conflict
I know I need to recognize the truth from lies, donât want to sympathize the sacrifice of my own pride

Iâve tried so hard to make this right, you never help me through consolation
The burden of unspoken words is wrought to bring us all astray
Is this the way that weâll end this?
A lifetimes to long to defy the better moments that weâll reflect on and make us sane
