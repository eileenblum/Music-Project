The sea of contingency was right before my sight
I thought I was ruined but the wake pulled me in, it compelled me
To open my options, to see things from another perspective
I need to realize that Iâm adept

Itâs through acknowledging our capability
We find the strength to live and pass the spirit on
I donât want to live with guilt, donât want to just move through space
We just need to focus more on what we have learned to love

Life is just a test of endurance, can you brave the immensity?
This world is brutal and savage, without hope you will surely surrender
And face the wrath of its ruthlessness, its time I remember to be strong
And brace the waves of society

Its time to face the waves of society, its time to break my state of complacency
