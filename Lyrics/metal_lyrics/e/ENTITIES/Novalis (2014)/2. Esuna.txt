[feat. Nick Arthur]What is the purpose of hatred
In those whose walk at offbeat paces
This stone cold heart of snow
You pride yourself on alone
If brings out misery
Only if time would pass you up
To make the meaning antique
We'd live so mirthfully

You would forsake those who show no harm
And abnegate their thoughts
The pain you seek in us
It is the pain you secrete

Live with passion
And evict your convictions
Not every life that you despise deserves the humiliation
It is still clear
That you can cure yourself through re-evaluation

Rise
Our world is moving forward
Close your eyes and it will leave you behind
End the obsession
And cleanse the selfish oppression
We aren't of the faint of heart

Hardened that cannot endure a sin

Live with passion
And evict your convictions
Not every life that you despise deserves the humiliation
It is still clear
That you can cure yourself through re-evaluation
