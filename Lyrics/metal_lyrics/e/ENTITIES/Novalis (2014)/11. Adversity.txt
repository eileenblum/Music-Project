I was wrong and I canât believe
That itâs taken me this long
To recognize adversity within me
I have tried to extinguish these demons

What does it take to see the silver lining?
When we live in a world of spite and denomination
I have chosen to see the darkest forms of circumstance
Yet Iâm the critic without direction
Itâs time to let this go

Iâve stricken down your words
With nothing more then a baseless perspective
And Iâm cheating my own mind into believing
Your thoughts are worthless
You donât deserve this

I thought Iâd be your voice of reason
To guide you to a better place
But I cannot dictate your direction

This has killed my way of interconnection
And itâs leaving me in a strain of remorse
That I just can't shake and decide to relegate

I know I need to ease the blame
The time is now, Iâll learn my faults, I need my mind to remember

Rise then fall, itâs been the way that Iâve atrophied
I want to grow and learn my place, devoid of imperfection

Take a look inside
There wasnât anything that seemed amiss in me
I would just dismiss the force that I portrayed
It was the frailty, I couldnât see in me

And I was wrong
It was the frailty, I couldnât see in me
