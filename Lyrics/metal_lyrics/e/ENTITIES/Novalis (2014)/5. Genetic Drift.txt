You will meet thousands of wandering souls
But who will you let define you?
I have scoured my world for common ground to build a base
To perpetuate the growth of camaraderie

There is no middle ground, I want sincerity in my life
To be the influence that will expel the grief (that rests the mind)

Iâve seen your eyes, they gleam with antipathy
Iâll risk my chance on someone else

Wait for gains, the pact will come unless you choose to burn this place
Donât make haste to satisfy your current state

Choose your fate, donât waste your time on those who will deviate
From the virtues you hold on to
Iâve found faith in those whoâve influenced me in a meaningful way

The time to make a choice, it rests on your shoulders now
Will you give into pain and let their dreams outshine your own?
Decide who you want to be and just let fate take its course

Iâll call the shots on this and choose the lives that I wont remiss
I need to know that I am worth more then just a means to an end

Genetic drift,
the chance of influence
itâs in my blood
I know I'm prone to react this way
I knew our thoughts and they could not relate
