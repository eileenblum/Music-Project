[feat. Tomas Raclavsky]Iâm beginning to glow and the nights just emerging
Amongst the hills of this foreign place
Sharing our hearts, illuminating our states
And though this flight wonât last forever
I know itâs one I wonât soon forget

Stay and bring your life to this circle
The stories endearing, weâre high off the harmony

This feels like home, but is it where I belong?
My mind canât decide
So pour the liquid of reason so we can surmise
A blue-sky design and leave the past behind us
I donât want to go back and live like I did in the past

Look at this gathering
We are the products of leniency
I now feel like one, is this the feeling of being real?
Tonight we are one

Entranced by the greater surroundings
Our spirits rekindled by a central flame

There is no feeling thatâs quite like this
This is the last time weâll share this space
Tonight we are one
