Itâs only silence that youâll be getting from me
These lines are broken and lack utility
Who knew weâd grow so far apart
From sheathed hostility
So many visions of places that were once shared and
Seem so far away
They now remind of how much faith Iâve lost in you

There is no value in playing games with me
Respect is gone, the bond undone

Straining thoughts, stress holding onto adverse matters
Have you felt the wind breeze right down your shoulders?
That cold that strikes the spine, itâs giving me the shivers
Distance read as giving up on our amity

In due time, despite the fights, I want us to see each other truly happy
A change thatâs made through reformation
Letâs give it time, to find our sights, maybe weâll learn something
So if we meet again and if the air is cleared
Weâll drop these passive aggressions
