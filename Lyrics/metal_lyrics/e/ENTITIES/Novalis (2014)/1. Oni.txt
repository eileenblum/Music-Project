Cleanse me, my thoughts are lost in the reverie
We have all fought the inner battles, we have all felt inadequate
There is a demon within us all

Keep the pain within yourself and just never take the time
To question what can be done to resolve what is not absolute
I might not find peace, but I have found stability
Stay, confront the hate inside you, erase it

I have seen much better days
But hope still flows within my veins
I still have faith my mind can change
And drop these thoughts that plague my gaze
The battle is not done, the fight has not been won

The state of desolation was what brought me to my knees
Iâve learned to test my mind before I give into this grief
Have you learned to test your mind?
False perception can make us blind

Donât let the evil control your sight
We are all in this together
Though our symptoms are not the same

Take the time to question what can resolve this phase
It is not permanent see less
