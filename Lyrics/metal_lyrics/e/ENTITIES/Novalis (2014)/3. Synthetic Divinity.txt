Call me god
If you believe in the faulty
It is the patrons who follow in the shadows of forgery
That have since clawed at the heels through their own cecity
This is the worship of mavericks
The way you pay your wage for the taste of the fame
It is the bane of our desires
And its been going for too long

For there are greater ideals
But yet youâre still romancing over taking what you canât reach
Itâs so pathetic how youâve been living
Through the visions of someone else

They are nothing more than whatâs made of you and I
The pedestal, itâs placed above the sky
Do you wish that you were granted this,
A life composed of inscience

You seek the elation?
The fix of novelty at your demand
I want to break
right through this worthless investment
You seem to deem as something real
I see youâre infatuated
But l can still not see the value in this idolization

The self-made are the members who will rule this land
Synthetic deities will not fool me

Stay away and donât return until you find yourself
So realize the path youâve chosen to take
