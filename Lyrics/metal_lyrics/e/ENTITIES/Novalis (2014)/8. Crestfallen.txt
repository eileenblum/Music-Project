So many times Iâve wondered why this life is so unappeasable
Itâs that its ravaged those who donât deserve the cruelty that it has served
That makes us pray for you

Itâs over twenty years youâve lived in fear
Thereâs no stopping this, the pain, it climbs to newer heights
Youâve worn the battle scars and here you are, it shows that youâre strong
A symbol of hope to everyone

It is a steady decline, an abomination thatâs disrupting us all
I want this all to subside, I know the cure will arrive

So hang in there please, the worst will not come
if we choose to believe this isnât end of all things
and so I will not hold my breath

The wind is still blowing
But I just can't seem to break through this phase
The thought of losing you becomes the worst of my fears
