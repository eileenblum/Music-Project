[feat. Matt Youkhana]It starts with conversation
And yet we make the occasion, a feeling made so discrete
Iâm sick of stepping through fields of broken glass
The lesions of frailty, they only drive us farther apart

Disconnected and itâs just the beginning
To know that pressure builds when
Weâre the victims of self-doubt
I canât seem to break down the barricade

Iâll stay to maintain whatâs left of this
Donât want to burn down these bridges tonight
There might be something here, something for both of us
Iâll run the risk of failing again
The darkness has risen and taken my vision
To places I canât describe
Its presence is grating and has left me so empty inside

Ascension seems stagnant but the will has grown inside
The shell will break down and rewrite your diatribe
Youâve used to define me

I can just tell from the reaction you donât like my
point of view
but its mine and I stand by, what is on my mind
couldnât care if you smite my

judgement
I smile in prize fight

so far Iâve been living to please,
decrease tension
now Iâm just thinking of me
I wanna venture

step to the deep end forever
sail ships of relations into great weather

Iâm at a point in my life where the words are artillery
given the right knowledge ill demolish almost anything

simmer down
you bitter clown
I see that frown
and body language that matches
unlatch your heart and just relax it

The walls that keep me in is a maze of obscurity, this place is
At your command and itâs lacking an exit
With every step, there is a sense of security
I know that patience aids, one day Iâll break your gaze
It is my only desire to bring you down to ground, away from being a stranger
