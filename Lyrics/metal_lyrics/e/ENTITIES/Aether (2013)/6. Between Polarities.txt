This is the time where I can look at pride
With open eyes, arise the will to deny
And through the desires of malice
Reaching to steer you in their direction
This administration of lies
Will set you across the divide

So donât surrender your senses now

We are autonomous but we still give in
To the interest of false prophecies
With no convictions
We wait to derive from the limited sources
So donât surrender your senses
And become the victims of empty suspicions

How can one be led to believe whatâs delusive?
You would fall off the edge in your timidness
Back down to the middens

You cannot lean to far and expect the balance of integrity
There is no right of way for those who act rashly

Between the sides of strife there is a light
Waiting to break
But on the rise we refuse to descend through this surface
Find your own light
And expand this conception
There is more to living life than serving expectations

Controlling this illusion of a man-made obsession
To unfold the plans of a biased perspective
(Light!)

I wonât be trapped in this chasm of ignorance
Limit the mind and stay inside, away from everything
This world needs air to breathe and yet itâs suffering
From distorted beliefs
I want in time, to see the sight
Where weâre no longer naive
