Today is another affliction
That tears everything thatâs inside
A fuse quick to ignite
Itâs time to block out the feelings
These are the reasons that we are empty
You need to be released and see the value of being serene
The youth in your eyes is truly defined
Negated by fear
You have brought the battle out from within
You need to be released and see the value of being serene
Expel the fires of rage into a state of bliss

So channel the pain and keep the passion tame
Know your psyche, know your psyche

This is scaling of peaks

When you look through the haze
Nothing is certain
So keep this all to yourself
With just assumptions made we arenât making the progress
To get us through this

Today is another affliction
That tears everything thatâs inside
You need to be released and see the value of being serene
Create a venerable sight that this world should see
So we can escape from this era
