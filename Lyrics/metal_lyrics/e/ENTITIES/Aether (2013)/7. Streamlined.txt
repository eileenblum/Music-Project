When have you last looked at pain straight in the eyes
And forced your angst, a guard to stay inside you
There is more to this place
We just need the will to modernize
We cannot always stay in a state
Of being fazed by these foreign virtues
Dispose this reckoning before you take flight

Expanding beyond the common practice of inflicting this indecency (indecency)
For there is no other way to keep us restrained
So we will search for the passage within ourselves
That reveals the tension that builds in the heat of the passion
For there is no other way to keep us restrained
So we will search for the passage within ourselves

And this succession of growth is key to becoming aware of ourselves
A beacon to shine
Inside of us all

It creates discretion and interprets outcomes
Thoughts so keen to make connections
That replaces the faulty impressions
With meaning and intention
That makes us grow from the inside out
We are fortified from those who dissemble hope

To those who seek revelations
There is nothing divine
It is the will of our minds
Understand that we are diseased
We only hold to common beliefs
Experience is to digress from the monotonous
That allows the paradigms that bind to collapse
And begins the mental fight to be refined

From the past until now there was a lack of vision
But the absence of sight has been lifted, to set me free

Is this the coming of age?
Look hard and you'll find
The missing pieces to reaching nobility
