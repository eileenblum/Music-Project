I am awake
The first step in admitting these fallacies
To the routes that have led us to this place

Those were the days we left behind, to escape
From the raw feelings of instilling inequity
It is not the path we have chosen to take
But the essence of life and the coming of age

We are not that easy to break
Guide us to the ways of being complete
Within these lines we are confined, lashing out
At the progress of others that destroys the sense of our doubt
We must revive the conscious mind
With the nobility of the wise
So our ideals wonât bring us down

Iâd rather fall and realize
That there are ways to relieving delusion
Than live through atrophy
As I waste away all of these days
It may be something we loathe
But we owe ourselves
The duty to find what sets us off to conquer the strain

The sky above is only glistening
Bring forth change and breathe this air
The purity so fine it will last a lifetime
So there is nothing besides
The will to keep on moving on in a forward progression
Bring forth change and breathe this air
The purity so fine it will last a lifetime
So there is nothing besides
The will to keep on moving on in a forward progression
