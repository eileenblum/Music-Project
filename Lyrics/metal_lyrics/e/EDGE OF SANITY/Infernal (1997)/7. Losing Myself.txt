[1.]
Losing time
counting hours
I'll never see myself again
And even though I'm alone I can't
remember what I'm missing
So I leave it be
[2.]
Closing down
I expect the hopelessness
and everything
And even though I'm alone
I can't remember what I'm missing
and that's all I need
[3.]
I am lost
I feel I am sinking now
like I was made of rain
Like a wave I roll into the nedless night
[C.]
I am not afraid
as the darkness starts
to make its way
I breathe as hard as you
as I end myy day
I sigh and shelter
as I try to sink that dep
as dep as you and make sure
that I won't fall asleep
[4.]
Losing days
I Need no hours
I'll never be myself again
And eve though it's killing me
I can't remember what I am missing
so I leave it be.
[5.]
I'm closing down
I expect the hopelessness again tonight
And even though it's killing me
I can't remember what I am missing
But it might be you
[Repeat 3.]
[Repeat C.]
That I won't fall asleep
[Repeat C.]
