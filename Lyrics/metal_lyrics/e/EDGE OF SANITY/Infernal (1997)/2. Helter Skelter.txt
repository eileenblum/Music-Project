[1.]
Awakening
All victims gathered One happy family
"I am your father"
"I am your friend"
"And you are my children and
shall be to the end"
On the verge of insanity
Manipulated
Blind they follow his every command
Stimulated by fluids and dust
And the love of a madman
never ever rusts
[2.]
Go now my children
There is work to be done
The pigs must be slaughtered
Our battle's begun
Leave them a message that
they never seen
Helter Skelter
Anarchy Supreme
[3.]
Washing her hands from the
blood she has spilled
Stabbing her to death for her father
Through the hands of his children
he murdered them all
Without even lifting his finger
no powers are needed when
leading the blind
But powers are needed to kill
A mastermind with intentions for chaos
Carnage
He murdered through will
[Repeat 2]
[4.]
No powers are needed when
leading the blind
But powers are needed to kill
A mastermind with intentions for chaos
Carnage
He murdered through will
On the verge of insanity
Manipulated
Blind they follow his every command
Stimulated by fluids and dust
And the love of a madman
never ever rusts
Never ever rusts

Peace  Love  Murder
