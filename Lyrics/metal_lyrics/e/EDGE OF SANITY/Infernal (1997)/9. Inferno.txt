[1.]
Inserted soul denied
No choice but staying alive
Left hand path laughter
Teh grin strenghts up my heartbeat
So wehere  am I to turn
Here where the daylight burns
I'm left for living pain
I've been denied the right to die
[C.]
I feed of sickening
You pain unpuzzles the inferno
I am the labyrinth
My shadow brings you to your death
[2.]
I'm placed to walk this earth
I'm sent to stop your birth
tillborn miscarriage
I'm the reason
I'm to blame
I Spread my blackened wings
Our city's doomed in war
Death is my employer
Abomination non-divine
[Repeat C.]
[3.]
So if you see me look away
Or never again you will see the light of day
The bringer of torture
The bringer of pain
never to die
but always bloodstained
Bloodstained
[4.]
This earth I walk alone
Trapped in the twilight zone
Murder and sickness
Like a hunter, hunting for no prey
I Spread my blackened wings
Our city's doomed in war
Death is my employer
Abomination non-divine
[Repeat C. (X2)]
