[1.]
So what is life
Don't we all dream of dying or when to die
Mesmerized we try to find
the answers we rather keep inside
So what are we on our knees
and image of all that used  be
Straight forward death campaign
Let's go where the dreams shall always reign
[2.]
So what is death
No need to die
Is it a power we can deny
Living dead a way of life
Laid to rest is this a lie
Forever turned backwards
Break the circle
Hypnotized
Insanity
Universal
Invert the starsign in the sky
[C.]
Hang on
Our journey's begun
Survival means failure under this black burning sun
Be strong your wait has been long
But these wings of fire will carry you on
[Repeat C.]
[3.]
Murder one
Race is run
Killing spree is life undone
Are you dead before you live
Do you have to take before you give
Day of time yet to come
Your clock is ticing by your dream-drum
left for dead
Left to life
Will your overcome the circle strife
[4.]
The skeletons in your closet world
awaits the angel of a world that burns
The dream begins
No need to repent your living sins
Nevergod
Nevermore
You're free to hate the ones before
Wordly devastation is nothing
compared to altered mind
[Repeat C (X2)]
Burn [X4]
[Repeat 1.]
