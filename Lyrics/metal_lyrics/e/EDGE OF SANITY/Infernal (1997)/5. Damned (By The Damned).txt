[1.]
Deathdefying son of god
Twice you died in vain
No stronger than mortal
That made you re-live your pain
And as the crown grows tighter around your head
you will die for our sins
As your own blood stings your eyes
Do you think you will ever win
[2.]
Your grace shines through the peeling pain
and that will be your death
Damned by the damned
and cursed by the cursed
Deliver the kiss of poisoned breath
[C.]
Infernal chanting forever after
Undying echoes of devils laughter
Self-chosen leader
You will die by your own hand
Cursed by the cursed
Damned by the damned
You'll be dethroned from your father
No longer god's son
Forever to be condemned
Forever banned you will be
Cursed by the cursed
Damned by the damned
[3.]
Unblessed you wander with no help for your god
Unwanted in heaven
Unwanted below
So was it worth it
All the pain you suffered for your king
You sacrificed your life to the righteous one of his only son
The denial
The denial of you yeah [X2]
[Repeat C.]
[4.]
(Damned by the damned by the.....)
Baptised in poisoned water
(Cursed by the cursed byt the....)
Lambs leading lamds to the slaughter
[Repeat C.]
Damned by the damned [X4]
