[1.]
In the strangest world of formlessness
I am reaching out to expand my mind
No more echoes and reflections
The future is now
I am the first in line
[2.]
Because I am alone
Here with my fantasies
Inside my cocoon
A self-constructed galaxy
[C.]
And hell is where the heart is
But I'll never understand
The fact that I am
And hell is where the heart is
I have lost the concept of life
Is there another to find
[4.]
Gotta ticket with
a microsynthetic design
For chemical dreams
To fill up the dead spot
in the bottom of my eyes
and welcome the big sleep
[5.]
Injected with silence
Fading in a sleepy confusion
A beautiful entrance
Into a higher dimension
[Repeat C.]
[6.]
I was about to explore
The Exit
The Door
Out of my labyrinth
A mind-detonation
The easy solution
Out of my labyrinth
[7.]
Between midnight and twilight
I leave my shell
To enter the dream-light
The final farewell
[Repeat 1.]
[Repeat 2.]
[Repeat C. (X2)]
[Repeat 7.]
