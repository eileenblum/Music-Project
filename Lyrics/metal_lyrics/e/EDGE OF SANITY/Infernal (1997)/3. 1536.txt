[1.]
Let me invite you to my nether-world
I'll show you sights you've never seen
You still my hunger
You're an easy prey
Your flesh is ripe
Your mind is weak
[2.]
And dark is the path where I'll be your guide
and there is no turning back
Don't you try to run
Because you're in my grip
and your soul now fades to black
[C.]
I am the one who will leave you behind
when I have used all of your mind
I am your incarnated fear
I have no soul
I am cold in my heart
I will always haunt you down
When you're dead you'll dream of me
[3.]
Let me invite you to the other side
Feel the presence of the dark
You scream and cry as I show you my world
Then I crawl into your mind
[4.]
I am the dream you have when you're all alone
I am everything you fear
I am the one who'll make you loose your mind
as the end draws near
[Repeat C.]
[5.]
And now... your time has come
Let me have your fading soul
Restless eyes watching you
I am crawling all around you
Face the darkness in my touch
[Repeat C.]
