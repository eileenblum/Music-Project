[1.]
An empty paper in front of me
and the pen that is supposed be
the link between
my thoughs  and the written word
[2.]
I always believed that I could write
about anything
But I am always wrong somehow
[3].
Wrong somehow
And I can't find a way
To release the poetry I hide
In the closet deep inside
[4.]
And Why do you hear these words
Whwn  I have nothing to say
I am only trying to complete this song
[5.]
So you can see
See that i don't know
That i don't know
the way to find the words
I'm given time
Time to find a rhyme
But all I do is write these empty lines
Though I wish that i could....

This album came about in ABYSS STUDIO Parlby, Grangarde the last weeks of 1996.
Peter Tagtgren made sure everything sounded heavy and ended up on tape. He also
mixed the whole thing all by himself. Thanx a lot for your patience, you rule!

We would like to dedicate this album to our long-time friend and band member
Sami Nerberg who couldn't appear on this recording due to personal problems.
We're all glad you're back. Cheers...
