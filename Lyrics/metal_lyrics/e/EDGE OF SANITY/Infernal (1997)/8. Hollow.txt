[1.]
Depression ain 'the reason why everything turns grey
When my mind's been drained through the stream of frozen minds
The hollow one
And thousands have walked this narrow way
But I'm not that kind of man
I wanna stay in my old me
Not leave this peaceful space
[C1.]
But every step brings me further and further away
Away from the man I used to be
I'm hollow
I'm cleaned
all fantasies erased from the sleepless dreams
I'm empty
I'm blank
Lost in an ocean where my soul's been sunked
[2.]
Confused greets me when I awake
I'm feeling restless inside
Not even raised from bed I wanna scream it all out
My artificicial  joy
From a mouth not mine
My hands are shaking of rage
Soon the last piece of me is gone
And nothing in my world
Can stop the hate inside from growing strong
[C2.]
I'm hollow
I'm cleaned
all fantasies erased from the dreamless sleep
I'm empty
I'm blank
Lost in an ocean where my soul's been sunked
[3.]
What I not know
I am not alone
They are all around
The hollow ones
all erased inside
I ain't here no mor 
[Repeat 1.]
[C3.]
But every step brings me further and further away
Away from the man I used to be
I'm hollow
I'm cleaned
all fantasies erased from the dreamless sleep
I'm empty
I'm blank
Lost in an ocean where my soul's been cursed
