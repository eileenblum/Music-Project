[1.]
Sunrise burning holes in this dead earth
No chance to live
No chance of rebirth
The rain shall fall as the sun still burn
Uncoloured rainbow
Grey
[2.]
Slay your soul
Led astray
The inferno will not end this way
Burning black
Stars will crack
The world you know will change today
[C.]
Running waters
The boiling rivers of desert lands
World lies slaughtered
This earth chose its own suicide
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
our weakness made us fall
It wasn't even our call
Do you see the bleakness of it all
The bleakness of it all
[3.]
Strangulation
The death of a planet
When the world chokes itself we will die with it
there is no escape from total extermination
Nail by nail
Grind them in
Your coffin closed
The air grows thin
Useless fight
Got no chance
When sickness rages
It's sure to win
[Repeat C.]
[Repeat C.]
The bleakness of it all [X6]
