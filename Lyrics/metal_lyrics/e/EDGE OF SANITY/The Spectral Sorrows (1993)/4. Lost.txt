I have seen eternity
I am the king of time
I am off the Edge of Sanity
My living ain't no crime
A soldier of existence
chosen to be
Protector of the earth
I'll last eternally
I awake into another sphere
reborn into the neverwhere
All alone in this space
There's no love nor disgrace
My body aches, I tremble with fear
The sky, the last I saw is no longer clear
Water and ice cover the ground
I can face reality, the world has drowned
I try to move but I am caged in ice
Floating bodies looking for their paradise
But the truth is no longer fantasy
in this world I am the only man to be.

[Chorus:] I AM LOST, I WAS NEVER CREATED
I AM LOST, lIFE IS DEVASTATED

We melt away and I feel the mud
that once was land for all
the sea of ice that used to be
the home of humanity
My soul is frozen, longing for fire
I barely believe I see this sight
All I can face is eternal night.
The sun awakes and shine on all the remains
The ice that encaged my body now flows in strains
Soon I can move, and walk away
What the future brings, who can say?

[chorus]

Eternal eyes, I can see the sky.
My lonely cries, I want my soul to die.
I am all alone, the world will now reform.
I'm born again, once cold sun now keeps me warm.

[chorus]
