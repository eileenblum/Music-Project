Three sons have I, and they
ride by my side--The fierce,
The black and the wicked are
their names--we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy--no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers--heathens rage
Witness our coming--gods of the dead.
I ride through the air--
I laugh as I die--with powers of evil
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked.
The 1st sin was trust--
Kill without warning--for blood now
I lust
Strong winds--magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead--they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Three sons have I, and they
ride by my side--The fierce,
The black and the wicked are
their names--we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy--no evangels of light.
Strong winds--magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead--they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
