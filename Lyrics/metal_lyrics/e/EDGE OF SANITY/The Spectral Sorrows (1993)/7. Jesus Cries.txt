In the beginning there was light.
The world could feel his holy might.
Born into a world he soon would leave.
People would not listen, people would decieve.
He tried to bless, he tried to heal,
he told the mighty powers to conseal.
The disciples of his father, born of God,
they believed that they would bleed the holy blood.

[Chorus:] My God, my God. Why have you forsaken me?
I am nailed to this cross, but spiritually I'm free.

For God so loved the world, that he gave us his only
begotten son and that whosoever believeth him
should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Jesus cries...
Jesus cries...
The star upon the sky, is it just another lullaby?
What a world do believe could be all a fucking lie!
I'll never serve in heaven. I rather rule in hell.

[chorus]

Jesus cries
A blessing from the skies
Jesus dies
A holy sacrifice!
