The ghoul has reached my coffin now he
smash the lid. All I see is darkness and
two shining eyes. Crawling to the church
and in a stream of light I see my mutila-
ted remains gore instead of flesh. Rotten
and filled with maggots I search for
modern life I would die to see, my kids
and wife. A scream break the silence (*) a
human being died. Shocked of this morbid
sight. Crawling in the night. I'm so near
my dying place, I can see my loved. I open
the door and there she stands, I hear the
children scream.

I saw people die, as dead as I was.
The children puked then died,
love has turned to carrion.
