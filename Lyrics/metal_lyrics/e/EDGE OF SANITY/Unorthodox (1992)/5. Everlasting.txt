Bleeding tears, crying blood a human
(being) emotionally odd, hear the sight,
feel the sound, spirits call from all aro-
und, as I wander closer to what I'll never
be a distant light approaches to prove
(my) insanity, the shadow pointed its fin-
ger, lies caresses my face it tells me it's
the bringer of what shall, what shall end
the phase.

[Chorus:]
Everlasting, unapproachable,
neverending, the immortal
one always casting shadows on the gro-
und. A blackened heart that won't stop to
pound. Everlasting, everlasting pane.
Reach the point of of no return as our pla-
net slowly burns. Cracking ground's wat-
chinme as I walk through river hades,
and soon my heart is frozen it'll never
stop to beat, nothing in this dimension
can bring me my defeat, the secrets in
your arteries will forever remain unsaid,
our sun is slowly dying, never, never to
burn red. [repeat chorus] you were meant
to be another one, time has come, frozen
earth, the stillness, the world will come
and go, [repeat chorus]
