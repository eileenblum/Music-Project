When all is said and all is done. Beneath
the ground, and man lies dead. When all
the earth is a cold grave and no more
brave. Bright things have birth when coo-
ling sun and stone-cold world together
hurled. Flame up as one o sons of men.
When all is flame what of your fame and
splendour then? When all is fire and fla-
ming air what of your rare and high desi-
re to turn the clod to a thing divine the
earth a shrine and man the God??
