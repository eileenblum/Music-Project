I am the master of your dreams, I am the
creator of your screams, I pulverize your
inner will invisible, no blood will spill.
Sent by the powers of the wind, now you
will regret that you sined. I am in com-
mand over earth and sea. I hold the key
to your lost infinity. Yeah. I am crawling
inside. Yeah. I drain you of your pride. The sha-
dows in the the darkness, are no reflection.
Just the souls of anger pointing your
direction. Enter the tunnel. Feel the
smell of your grave, demonic majesty,
you're lost to darkness... After, after,
afterlife, I am rising after twilight. I am
the reason why tomorrow never comes.
Festerday goes on and on. Satan is my
darkened son. Did life itself pull me
thru this hell? There's no time so it will
never tell. In this world of boiling heat, I
faced my final, fucking defeat. None
shall save, I enslave. Laughing, this can't
be true. Dying, they came to steal your
world.
