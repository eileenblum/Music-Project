[Psalm 1 'The Blessing']

[The Priest:]
Confess your sins to God, don't be afraid.
Just like me of flesh and blood you're
made. I can heal your wounds and cleanse
your soul, but never return all those
lives you stole.
[The Witch:]
'You can burn in hell'
[The Preacher]
God gives you shelter at heavens shore,
abandon your thoughts to the mighty.
Into the chapel of holyness, live for the
sacred empire, engender the Enigma.
[The Unorthodox]
Sacerdotal majesty, a recreant nonentity?
Do you remember when you said.
[The Priest]
I can heal the dead.
[The Unorthodox]
Paroxysmal ecstacy, dementia or deity?
Sapless you are crawling, to confess
your sins?

[Psalm 2 'Celestial Dissension']

The further side, a confounded lie,
panegyration a reunion of riddles? The
sorrow, the funeral truth, mentally
fraud wih pseudo relics, enigma, unholy,
ungodly, commander of the regeneration.
Insidious and caught, implored by disgra-
ce. Inhumation... The burial of man. Con-
fession... Unify all evil. Deep inside, the
unknown quest, the sphere is so depres-
sed, a harp with broken strings, and the gro-
und, this mazy world do still exist, the
ghouls arise from the mist. Renascent
through the holy scripture, submission
to what for us is illusion. From the tene-
brous depths of history, who will divulge
the mystery. Unguiculated, unholy,
ungodly, commander of the regenerati-
on, insidious and caught, implored by dis-
grace, inhumation... The burial of man,
comfession... Unify all evil.

Ha, ha, ha, haoow.
