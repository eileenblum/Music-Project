(...eye can see you) Look into my eyes, what
do you see? I'm not man, I am no demon. I
color you red, my murder's fuckin' art
son of the dead. I was never born. I send
you back to pre-birth. Beyond this life
you shall dwell. I'm your fuckin' saviour
suffer my everlasting pain. Don't even
think about dying, you poor excuse of a
human being, in the veins of evil, black
blood flow eternally. This sabbath of
sickness; proves my soul's bizarr. The
master of morbidity, my cuts don't leave
scars. Endless temptation to sicken the
blessed, I swallow your heart as I carve in
your flesh... In your flesh! Born of the
dead, I am blasphemy. I'll end your fanta-
sies, save you from mankind just like
lambs to the slaughter. God made you
blind, darker than black. I am the serpent
of Eden... Eden. I've tasted the herbs of
lust and desire. I am no enemy, I drain
you of life and leave you in fire... Fire. In
the veins.
