I hear the sound of darkness moving closer to my ears.
All alone and wounded I lie here resembling all the years.
This war is over for mankind.
The X-machines will end us all.
Technology is fatal.
We will see the future and then we fall.

Thunder and Lightning.
The rain is whipping my naked skin.
Screaming. Dying in sin.
BLOOD-COLORED.
THE X-MACHINES JUST WIPED AWAY ALL LIFE.
THE BLOOD-COLORED SKY
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT WILL LIVE WHEN I DIE.

All dead, all gone, all hope is lost.
They came from nowhere to end our race.
I see the center of the world,
it's now a desert that no wind will embrace.
Dark formations, shadows laugh.
I lie here waiting for the end.
I know they will send the last ones down to make sure that we all descend.

Nightmares come true.
Why can't I put myself away??
Dying inside. Or am I already dead?
BLOOD-COLORED...
THE X-MACHINES JUST WIPED AWAY ALL LIFE.
THE BLOOD-COLORED SKY
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT WILL LIVE WHEN I DIE.

Women and children screaming in pain.
The war breeds no winner
Dying in the blood filled rain

I hear the sound of darkness moving closer to my ears.
All alone and wounded I lie here resembling all the years.
This war is over for mankind. The X-machines will end us all.
Technology is fatal. We will see the future and then we fall.

Thunder and Lightning. The rain is whipping my naked skin.
Screaming. Dying in sin.
BLOOD-COLORED...
THE X-MACHINES JUST WIPED AWAY ALL LIFE.
THE BLOOD-COLORED SKY
IS THE ONLY THING
THAT WILL LIVE WHEN I DIE.
