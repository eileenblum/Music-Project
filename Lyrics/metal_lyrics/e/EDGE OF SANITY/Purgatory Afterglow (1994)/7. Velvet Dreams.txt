I wipe the dust from shoulders, the dust from velvet sands.
In dreamland of non-divine, free of all space and time.
I watch across the fields, the fields of forever.
And as the sand turns to stars in my eyes... I'm no longer blind.
Start to walk through landscapes of frozen glass.
The velvet sands reflect me like a mirror.
My skin is pale blue but I feel my body burning with fever.
I see myself in the velvet sand, what am I? Human, soul or demon??
Embodied emotions, infinite. Eternal sleep awaits me as I am

DREAMING VELVET DREAMS, CRYING PURPLE TEARS,
I CHANGE. LAUGHTER TURNS TO HATE.
BLOOD-DROWNED ARE MY THOUGHTS. THE RAINBOW TURNS ALL RED.
I BURN I'M IN FIRE BURNED BY VELVET DREAMS.

I stroll through the infinite garden of neverending frost.
Unblessed, unpure. Here I am, my own god and master.
Everything is soft like velvet, but the velvet dreams obscure my mind.
I pick a rose so black but I am scarred by the thorns.
And it feels like I was in fire. Burned by velvet dreams.
That seems so safe...
Bless me. Caress me. Take away my fears.
Through the pain in velvet dreams, wipe away my purple tears.
Burn me, turn me. Make me one with the other side.
Healed by the burning in velvet dreams, with the dead now i ride.
Embodied emotions, infinite. Sleep awaits no longer nevermore shall I...

DREAM THOSE VELVET DREAMS, CRY THOSE PURPLE TEARS.
NEVER, NEVERMORE. I STAND ABOUT DIVINE.
GOD OF NONE AND ALL. KNOWLEDGE BEYOND.
THE RAINBOW AND THE STARS. NEVER MORE SHALL I.
DREAMS THOSE VELVET DREAMS, CRY THOSE PURPLE TEARS.
DREAM THOSE VELVET DREAMS, CRY THOSE PURPLE TEARS.
NEVER, NEVERMORE. I STAND ABOUT DIVINE.
GOD OF NONE AND ALL. KNOWLEDGE BEYOND.
THE RAINBOW AND THE STARS.

Now I am the unknown that you love. God of none and all.
