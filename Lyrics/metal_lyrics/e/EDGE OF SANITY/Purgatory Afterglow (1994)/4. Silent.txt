To live a life in silence, to live without the word.
I'm sitting here like a silent bird.
You try to understand the symbols of my hand.
I am like a rock that has turned to sand.

[Chorus:] SILENT. MUTED FOR ETERNAL TIME? SO VIOLENT.
BUT I JUST CAN'T CONFESS MY CRIME

Like every human being there is a thing I seek.
For me the day when I can finally speak.
To hear my voice again, I still remember when
I could say what was on my mind.
I rule the streets at night, against myself I fight.
I am only trying to survive you see.
No man will ever live after what I will give.
His soul will go to meet my voice up there.

[Chorus]

Piece by piece I die. Soon there's no
tears to cry. I am fading out just like a star falling
from the sky! I hear me in my dreams. I can't deny
I am suffering. Judge from my silent screams.
Without my voice I am withering.
Oh, how I wish to scream and to wake
up from this dream, but the pain I feel is real.
I try to say my name. But I always hear the same:
Silence! It drives me insane. To live a life in silence,
to live without the word. I'm sitting here like a silent bird.

You try to understand the symbols of my hand. I am like a
rock that has turned to sand. Like every human being there's
a thing I seek, for me the day when I can finally speak. To
hear my voice again I still remember when I could say what
was on my mind. Silent.

[Chorus]

The written word has no meaning,
there is no harmony in my words.
