Freedom = fuck! People secure their freedom with a gun.
They have lost faith in everything even in themselves.
Gun-propaganda from the land of the free - "The land of pain and misery".
We must be able to protect ourselves.
What!? Face a gun with a gun??? (!!!)
Violence breeds violence, death is the only outcome.
Hate breeds hate. Transform to chaos.

CAN'T YOU SEE IT? ARE YOU BLIND? A FUCKING WARGAMS OF MANKIND.
WITHOUT VOICE, WITHOUT CHOICE THE WORLD WILL ENTER CHAOS!

"With my gun, I am safe" Kiss my ass!!
You still live in fear! Spare me the pain to live in bullet rain.
Fear is the cause that triggers the pain
that leads us to blow out each others brains.
Gun-propaganda from the land of the free - "The land of pain and misery".
We must be able to protect ourselves.
What!? Face a gun with a gun??? (!!!)
Violence breeds violence, death is the only outcome.
Hate breeds hate. Transforms to chaos...

CAN'T YOU SEE IT? ARE YOU BLIND?... CHAOS!!
