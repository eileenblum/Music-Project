Crying. The anger and sorrow in your eyes is shining
through your disguise, you can not hide all your lies!
Falling. The abyss you enter is so deep, it doesn't
matter how much you will weep, you will never reach
the ground again. You're draining your emotions,
the poison is your God. Injection for depression. The
needle is your rod. Your heart will never feel. The
love that it will steal.

[Chorus:] NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE STARS ALIGHT,
LIKE DIAMONDS IN THE WINTER NIGHT. DO THINK
OF ME, REMEMBER ME. SO READS MY ELEGY. NEXT TIME I
SEE THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT LIKE WHITE EYES IN THE
DARKENED LIGHT, I'M FREE NO CHAINS ARE HOLDING ME.
BUT STILL I LIVE BY YOUR ELEGY.

Leaving. The world I leave will never know. But below
you will see my glow and the fire shall be eternal.
Weeping. The tears you cry, I know the taste. Can't
you see they're such a waste. You can never bring
me back again. You'll never know what happened but I
couldn't go on. It felt like I was running a race
that no man ever won. My soul will always love the
ones I am far above...

[Chorus]

Tears are falling... Tears are falling in the dark.
Your fears are calling. I've left my mark.
Burning. The flames that rise will be my end. So on for
now I will pretend that I am back on earth again.
Lonely. The shadows haunt me as I burn. Now I know
there is no return. My soul will slowly turn to dust.
I'm passing through dimensions where no one's ever been.
I'm heading for the secrets that no man's ever seen.
What lies below will I ever know??(!?)

[Chorus]
