Born a slave. Chained since day one.
From the cradle to the grave you'll be
"The holy son". Raised to obey. Taught
to see the light. Forced to pray and to
praise the "fathers" might. I can see. I can
hear. Mass indoctrination. Then the truth
will appear, mental devastation.

My sins will be forgiven. The beginning of the madness.
I fear no foe for I am eternal. Ain't gonna feel no grief.
The sinner and the sadness. I fuck the law I kill in the name of Christ.

I am sick. I believe that I am the new messiah.
The sinner you can't retrieve
I am the god of Christianity. Born to sin and
to have them all forgiven. A deceiver, no believer.
You're sick you holy fake. Night and day, anyway,
I benight the unpure. Live in sin. And where I've
been? I have blessed a whore!

To death you will be driven. The beginning of the madness.
I fear no foe for I am eternal. Ain't gonna feel no grief.
The sinner and the sadness. I fuck the law all in the name, all in the name of Christ.

I am the new messiah. I am the god of fire.
I will make you bleed.
Christianicide. To the cross - crucified.
Christianicide. I will laugh - lies denied.

My sins will be forgiven...
