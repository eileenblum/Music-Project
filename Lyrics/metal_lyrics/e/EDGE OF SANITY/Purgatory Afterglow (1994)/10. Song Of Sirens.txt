War world now. Hear the song of the sirens.
Then silence won't be for long.
Hear the digging. All grave, too soon?
Earth Pompeii. The second moon.

BEACHWORLD... AND THE SONG OF SIRENS
TO THE BEACHWORLD... AND THE SONG OF SIRENS.

Kill all air. Smoke the ground.
Neverflow. Bleeding trees.
End all time. Dismembered sun.
Living Death

AND TO THE BEACHWORLD... AND THE SONG OF SIRENS
TO THE BEACHWORLD... AND THE SONG OF SIRENS

War world now...
