[1.]
The stranger it seems, the clearer it gets in my eyes
It's like all that is wicked, is natural with my sight
As damned as I may seem to you, the feeling gets me high
Cause I do feel I'm blessed, with the demoneye

[2.]
With eyes of a damned, and sense of the insane
The stark  raving mad, run without shame

[3.]
The stranger it seems, the stronger I get in my  mind
You'll all be subhuman, inferior to my shame

[4.]
The demon am I, and demon my eyes
I am the power, watch me arise

[5.]
Sacred sights of fire
Blinds my human eyes
Truth as spooked by liars
Leaves me drained and dry

[C.]
Demoneye, bless my sight
Let me live without the light
The demon is not a part of me
I, am part of the demon

[REPEAT C.]

[6.]
N' the clearer it gets, the quicker it darkens the skys
And I'll become king, of all that you despise

[REPEAT 2.]
[REPEAT 5.]
[REPEAT C. x2]
[REPEAT 2.]

Demoneye, demon
