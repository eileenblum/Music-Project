[1.]
I am the one that makes you weak
I am the one that makes you feel like a spineless creep
I am the one without no heart
I am the one that tears your fuckin' life apart

[2.]
And so you wonder where I came from
Look deep inside
And so you wonder why have I come
There ain't no reason why

[C.]
A parasite from within
Feeding from your own sins
Draining your sanity, 'til insanity arrives
I came to bleed you dry
I came to see you die
I came to bleed you dry

[3.]
And you're the one that keeps me strong
And you're the one that keeps me going on and on
Yeah you're the one that feeds me
And when you die, I will still be

[4.]
No chains or ropes can ever hold me back
I'm breaking you down, crack by crack
Yeah you're the one that feeds me
And when you die, I will still be

[REPEAT 2.]
[REPEAT C.]

[5.]
I came to bleed you dry
I came to see you die
I came to bleed you dry
I came to see you die
