[1.]
All is dead in me, except my will to be
Living blood no longer feeds me
Need no sympathy, for the life of being dead
Of being eternally, I'm no stranger to this afterlife
There's no puzzles, there's no strife
Cause to me I'm real, and the things I feel
Are things you can't even dream

[2.]
Through the night a stalk, like a dead I walk
Have no clue what it is that is driving me
My nocturnal ways, seems to save me
Everything is black and white and grey
Like a vagabond, yet an undead one
Roaming the land 'til I feel that my race is run
Have no misery, of this life alone
No blood in my veins and feel that my heartbeats gone, uh!

[C1.]
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died

[3.]
All the things you fear, as the night draws near
That is the world, witch I choose to live
Where the nightmares are made, where the beasts
Under your bed have much lighter shade
In a human shell, this is not my hell, now I feel
I'm growing. By dying, I'm knowing
When was I deceased, when was my release
Eternally thankful am I to death divine

[C2.]
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died
If you talk the talk, learn to walk the walk
That's a rule that you live and die by
That's the rule I lived and died

[4.]
Dead I walk, dead I walk
