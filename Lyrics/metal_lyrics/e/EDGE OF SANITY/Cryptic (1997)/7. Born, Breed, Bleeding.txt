[1.]
Kneel down, yeah down on your knees
We are superior, do as we please
Won't let you up, we'll keep you restrained
We'll make sure, that your life is pain
You are the poison that sickens our land
Keep you under water, so you can't make your stand
We are infected and you're the disease
Let you live like animals so you powers won't increase

[2.]
You're a slave, make no mistake
This is the order, you give and we take
From the start , we'll keep you in chains
Ball and chain, that you barely can lift
So stay down, down in your pit
You are a venom you fucking misfit
We'll make you normal and keep you in shape
Free from emotion can't love nor hate 

[3.]
No emotion, you feel your mind is drained
Your mind is slowly brainwashed
Soul distortion, an empty feeling fills you
We grind your love and hate to shreds

[C.]
What will it take for you to realize
That you are killing yourselves
What will it take for you to open your eyes
Are you beyond all help
What will it take for you to realize
That you are killing yourselves
What will it take for you to open your eyes

[4.]
You're a slave, make no mistake
This is the order, you give and we take
From the start , we'll keep you in chains
Ball and chain, that you barely can lift
Kneel down, yeah down on your knees
We are superior, do as we please
Won't let you up, we'll keep you restrained
We'll make sure, that your life is pain

[5.]
Psychic violence keeps you restrained
Forever your our slave
Keep you looking with ball and chain
Leeds you to the shallow grave

[6.]
No emotion, enslaved
Your mind is slowly brainwashed
Soul distortion, an empty feeling fills you
We grind your love and hate to shreds

[REPEAT C.]

[7.]
Born, breed, bleeding...
