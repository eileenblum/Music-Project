[1.]
We live our lives in our daily fashion
Confuse our lives with unanswered questions
Seems everybody needs a reason to live
Seems everybody has someone to forgive

[2.]
So they control their life with destiny
Blame it on "It was meant to be"

[3.]
I won't be a part of the role
I'd rather stay uncontrolled
I just believe in odd accidents
I have remorse that I can't repent

[C.]
It's just another race to be run
And your day is what you make it
And just maybe I want it undone
But I just have to face it

[4.]
So live your life in your daily fashion
Forget your questions and live by passion
You don't need anything to obey
And if things go wrong, well you just have to pay

[REPEAT 2.]
[REPEAT C.]
[REPEAT 1.]
[REPEAT 4.]

[REPEAT C. x2]
