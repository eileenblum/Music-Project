Thirty years have passed
since my dying day.
My life went to fast,
from birth to my decay.

Decomposition of my body.
Abeyance in my grave.
Time has maimed my flesh,
I've addled in my cave.

Paralized...
By the morbid fact:
I'm alive...
But my skull is cracked!!

I feel no aggrieve,
no smell of my putrid carcass.
Human aberration,
let me die again!!!

Let me die again!
Let me die again!
