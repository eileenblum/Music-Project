Impulsive necroplasma.
Injected in your veins.
Spiritually deceased.
Bringing life to dead and death do life.

Chemical injection, producing immortality.
From this fate, you cannot flee.

Suffocate, filled with hate, pray to die!!!

Suffocate, ripping your soul.
Sience abuse has reached its goal.
Filled with hate, all feelings are gone.
You are trapped within.

You feel no pain, pain is all you feel.
Injection is prepared, for eternity.
It circles in your blood, rigor mortis course
is twisting impulses your life is but is no more.

Die... Rise high above the low.
Deathless... Still you can feel the flow.

Never know which way you'll fade.
Insane cell will always be.
Dominate, ripping your mind.
In the maze of existence...
