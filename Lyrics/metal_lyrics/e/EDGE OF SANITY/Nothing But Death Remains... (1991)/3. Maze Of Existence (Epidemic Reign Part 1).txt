Left alone.
And left to live in a rotting world.
Running, searcing.
Kur-nu-gi-a,
Reich of death will never let you in.
Torment, you suffer.
Not only God.
And his almighty lies can bring you endless life.
Chemical torture.
Left to search for the end in a fading world.
Deformed but living.

No more suffering, no more pain.
Never be taking your last breath.
You're emerging from the human race.

Welcome to eternal life.
Immortality for sale.
Resistant to all forms of death.
Tormented in the maze of existence.

Epidemic reign.
Epidemic reign.
Epidemic reign can control the cells within.
Never ending search for the other side.
Segrated tissues will see the final day.

Injecting the dose into your mind.
A repulsive change begins.
In this war against yourself.
Internally your body is healed.
