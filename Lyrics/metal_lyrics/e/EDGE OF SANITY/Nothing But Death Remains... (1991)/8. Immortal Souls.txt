The arrival of the dead, mourning souls arise.
Searching for a way, to reach humanity.

Couldn't stand the pain, left our world too fast.
Caught in light so black, and there ain't no turning back...
NO!

Escaping from the second sky, souls cry in despair.
Forgotten lives surrounds me now.
But I don't know they're here.

Jealousy and utter hate, fills their empty shell.
Longing back to mother earth, where they all deceased.

How will I know, who can tell when I'll die?
Live, live my friend till the end of all time.
No, no way out from the spell where you're caught.
So we must be strong, holding on to our lives.

Into the void.
Immortal souls will rise.
Rising from the dead.

Fooled by the stronger ones. Confused they fly around.
Can't break free from the chains of death.
Chains that keep then bound.
They can't control their mourning souls.
Their mind is still alive.
Now they've seen their destiny.
And is trying to break free.

Stronger forces take control and bring them back to earth.
Hoping for a second chance.
Longing for a rebirth.

Life, life ain't fair for thy one's who have lost!
