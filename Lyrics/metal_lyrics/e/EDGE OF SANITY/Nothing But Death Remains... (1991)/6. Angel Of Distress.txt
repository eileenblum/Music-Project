Death! Possession!

At the gates of dawn,
she awaits your arrival.
Your loneliness, her way,
to realize her revival.

Only the weak shall die,
and only the strong shall remain.
The fear in your eyes,
it's your life she'll drain.

Death by the angel of distress.
... the angel!

Alter the dying,
no longer lying.
Now you are flying,
the wings of the angel!

A fulgent light,
enchants teh sky.
The torture is gone,
and so is your life.

And you died for the angel of distress.
Now you're the angel!
