[Japanese Bonus Track]Drinking the water from my filthy cup,
The TV spits out news from a world so corrupt.
The media made me, now I make the news.
I'll make you follow on this carnage cruise.
Mass murder is my profession.
I kill and maim without discrimination.
You would not believe all the crimes I commit.
I make love to the dead whose throat I just slit.

I lie awake, yet nothing keeps me awoken.
It stays the same, the boredom leaves me choking.
I light another cigarette,
It's not the last one for sometime yet.
I'm in desperate need of something.

The streets I prowl as I search my prey.
Like the wolfman I change when the night eats the day.
No virtual, your flesh is my religion.
There's no cure for me, I'm the venom.

I lie awake, yet nothing keeps me awoken.
It stays the same, the boredom leaves me choking.
I light another cigarette,
It's not the last one for sometime yet.
I'm in desperate need of something.
