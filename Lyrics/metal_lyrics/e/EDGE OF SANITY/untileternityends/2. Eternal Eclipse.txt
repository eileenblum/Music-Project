I hate humanity and I will not hesitate to kill!
There's been this hatred since my birth, and I can feel it still
Deep inside my cold heart I am yearning to slay
And hence I know the law I know there's a better way

Only in the darkness, only in the anti-light
Can there be some silence in my mind
Praying to the darkest angels time and time again
Divided I will see what makes me blind

Light turns black, and there's no turning back
From the eternal eclipse!
My eyes discover blackened skies
Oh the eternal eclipse!
Turns black and there's no turning back!
From the eternal eclipse!
My eyes discover blackened skies!

All crowded places makes me wanna go berserk
But instead I'm killing, in the darkness I will lurk
Laying in my bed at night I love the dark I see
Wishing hoping that some day it will last eternally

Mighty forces of the dark of this dream of mine
Await what magic darkness will enshrine

Night comes back and light will turn to black
With the eternal eclipse!
I see the mortals' destiny
Oh, the eternal eclipse!
Comes back and light will turn to black
With the eternal eclipse!
I've seen the mortals' destiny!
