Waiting for something to come out of the dark
I know I have seen him, his presence is cold
Wherever he's moving, he's leaving his mark
Thunder and lightening strikes, and hell unfolds

Ruler of shadows is coming to cross
The open fields where his soldiers fought
No sign of sadness no remorse for the loss
He's in command of the souls that he's caught

The flowers will wither and the air will be dry
The king of the dark side will goodness defy
Starlight will fade and the sun will turn black
Clouds will explode and the surface will crack

He will rule until eternity ends
He will rule until eternity ends
King of fire

The darkness will swallow, all life will be dead
There's no solution into death you'll be led
The fire and the odour of burning remains
Mother earth is fading trembling in pains

The leaves have now fallen
Buried in the soil
The water in the oceans is starting to boil
Sunlight is killing - hell in advance
Onto the dead earth the devils will dance

He will rule until eternity ends
He will rule until eternity ends
King of fire

Now I am here at the end of my days
I feel the lord move in mysterious ways
Now I can feel this is the end for this place
I feel the lord will be giving no grace

He will rule until eternity ends
He will rule until eternity ends
King of fire
