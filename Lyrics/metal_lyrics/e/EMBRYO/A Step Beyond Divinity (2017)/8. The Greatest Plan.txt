Born in an era where everything was changing in the lives of men,
out from the darkness of Middle Ages,
through the light of Renaissance,
to an ancient anthropocentrism.

You found the truth in nature laws,
their minds expected to know it all;
there's only a way to earn wisdom:
"Open the eyes, you fool!"

You studied animals, rivers and clouds,
the movements of nature all around.

You thought that to understand the world
you should have learned how creatures moved.
You built your own idea of the body of men.

"Blood flaws in the veins, pushed by the heart, like rivers running to the sea:
nature is full of infinite reasons that have never been in experience".
You wanted to discover them to cross the limits of mankind

to reach the Prime Mover
though the ecstatic contemplation.

You found the truth in nature laws,
their minds expected to know it all;
there's only a way to earn wisdom.

You saw a lighting blinding your brain,
fill your soul, unveiling the frame
of universe, the greatest plan of everything
that you wanted to share with them all.

"Open the eyes, you fool!"
