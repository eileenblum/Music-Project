You seemed a fugitive from your cradle in the plain
where you were supported in everything.

Dazzled by a strong and legendary name
focused on overcoming and on conquering blame.
You thought to recognize the majesty of a king,
fighting within, swallowing incoherence not to sink.

Closing your eyes on what was happening around
you tried to find solutions overwhelming your disgust.

Your convictions that war was an insane brutality.
your disgust, your convictions that war was an insane brutality.

You were moving from town to town,
building where devastation was done.

focused on overcoming and on conquering blame.
You thought to recognize the majesty of a king,
fighting within, swallowing incoherence not to sink.

Closing your eyes on what was happening around
you tried to find solutions overwhelming your disgust.

Climbing the enemies' castle walls,
walking under water to destroy the boats,
taking innocent lives with your science.

Your disgust, your convictions that war was an insane brutality.
Your disgust, your convictions that war was an insane brutality.

You decided to give up, too much brutishness you found.
You repudiated him.

Dazzled by a strong and legendary name
focused on overcoming and on conquering blame.
You thought to recognize the majesty of a king,
fighting within, swallowing incoherence not to sink.

Closing your eyes on what was happening around
you tried to find solutions overwhelming your disgust.
