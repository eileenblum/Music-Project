You were just a young and promising painter at the time,
curious and fascinated by the life of high society;
surrounded by the sons of people leading the town,
caught in the middle of power plays.

A concealed feud for the money and fame.
They said:
"Luxury and blasphemy infect society;
sodomy and misery corrupt the youngest minds
mischievous pederasts have to be overthrown".

At night, in the darkness of (the) downtown, in decay
of human flesh, away from (eyes of) false morality.

They turned on a prying spotlight on your (own) instincts.

A shame for your father,
a shame for your own (job) carrier;
stares of rough judgement
chocked your sexuality.

Marked with the holy fire of god,
you shrunk from any spontaneous thought;
stifled by the thousands eyes of the crowd
you confined your impulsiveness under your shame.

They said:
"Luxury and blasphemy infect society;
sodomy and misery corrupt the youngest minds
mischievous pederasts have to be overthrown".

(An) anonym violated your privacy,
a vile finger pointed to your intimacy.

A shame for your father,
a shame for your own (job) carrier;
stares of rough judgement
chocked your sexuality.
