Lost in a maelstrom, waiting for thoughts to tell
elements secrets and fluid theories to dare;
overflowing the planes is not just bravado:
nourish the soil and starving out in town.
Art merged with science, the essence of your saga,
relief for your soul, the way for going further:
destroying the barriers of your mind:
obey the nature, crossing incognito

to reach wisdom

Trapped in a life of contradictions
when you don't know where to go,
afraid of people and their judges,
you found your shelter in your own.

Dismemberment of corpses made to understand:
a maze of veins like slopes full of lava,
vessels and muscles the "engine" parts to rev
ill bodies in the court of Medici.
Necromancer in the eyes of narrow men,
constrained in a perennial tense, symbiotic;
indoctrinated by the laws of matters, no space for alibi.

"You blind!"

Trapped in a life of contradictions
when you don't know where to go,
afraid of people and their judges,
you found your shelter in your own.

Lies and ignorance fed your torment and your hell;
envy and shallowness undermined your will to care;
obscurantism permeated your slender ego;
nocturnal visions enlightened your brain;
aiming at peace aiming your patron's armada.
Reluctant painter,
dreamer then disillusioned;
onanism like an ex-voto.
