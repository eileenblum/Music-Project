In the darkness of the night
Far from the eyes of a blind god
Your only guide was your mind
But a candle light to help your sight

You just wanted to know
And longing for the truth
Analyzing bodies in that room
There's no dogma unsupported by proofs

They gave you corpses nobody wanted
Useless flesh you gave a sense
You used knives to open them
But not for sadistic intent

You just wanted to know
And longing for the truth
Analyzing bodies in that room
There's no dogma unsupported by proofs

Looking to the sky
Try to see the divine
With your hands in the chest holding hearts
Feeling the blood that once was flowing

Eyes and livers
Muscles and nerves
Skulls and bones
The keys to test

The perfection of creation
The existence of the almighty

You just wanted to know
And longing for the truth
Analyzing bodies in that room
There's no dogma unsupported by proofs

I need to touch to believe that you exist
