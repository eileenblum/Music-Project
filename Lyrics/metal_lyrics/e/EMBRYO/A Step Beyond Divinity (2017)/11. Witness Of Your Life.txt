You were mesmerized by the light of the moon,
all around conspiracies were deranging your doom.
The shelter of the favor you caught so hard
was suddenly ground and torn apart.

When you thought you reached
the perfect equilibrium; you perceived you are just
the witness of your own life.
When you felt it was time
to lower your guard, they hurdled in your face
that you are
the victim of your freedom demise.

Matters of power were leading their hands
to cover with blood their native lands.

When you thought you reached
the perfect equilibrium; you perceived you are just
the witness of your own life.
When you felt it was time
to lower your guard, they hurdled in your face
that you are
the victim of your freedom demise.

Freedom.

Witness of your life!

When you thought you reached
the perfect equilibrium; you perceived you are just
the witness of your own life.
When you felt it was time
to lower your guard, they hurdled in your face
that you are
the victim of your freedom demise.

Once again you were forced to leave,
once again goals you couldn't achieve.
