Almost two decades has gone since you went away,
nothing seemed changed, not even birds of prey;
the mountains kept on overhanging around,
the rivers rushed with that familiar sound.

Some things will never change: the ones you thought that should
support you without any doubt are the first to blame your name.

Back in the city where you learned your art,
back to the friends that shared with you that path.

Some people were afraid of your omniscient wisdom
some other just refused your naturalist system.

Some things will never change: the ones you thought that should
support you without any doubt are the first to blame your name,
to blame your fame, to shame you.

The same, always the same difference.
The same!

They couldn't understand what ruled your mind,
they just stopped to the image, no curiosity to find
the revolutionary ideas that filled your head,
they preferred to label you as a freak or as a threat.

Some things will never change: the ones you thought that should
support you without any doubt are the first to blame your name,
to blame your fame.
