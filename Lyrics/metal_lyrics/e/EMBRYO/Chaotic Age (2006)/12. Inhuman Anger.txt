Condemned to eternal pain
I forged my soul in hate
Reaction to injustice
Evil lust of blood

Voices, screaming, crying
I'll change your tears
Into my inhuman anger

You know the reason why
I'll smash your useless lives
I spread around my death
You're now my sacrificial lambs

Have no fear, enjoy the pain, cut your veins
Lucidity leaves your mind and your actions

Voices, screamings, crying
I'll change your tears
Into my inhuman anger
