Twenty-first century, countdown has just begun
I'm looking forward to nuclear holocaust

Nuclear healing, to erase all human forms
Nuclear healing

Lords of nations will be blown up with lands and seas
Atomic winds and radioactivity
Will cross the mountains to destroy what men have built
Now Earth is ready to regain supremacy

Nuclear healing, to erase all human forms
Nuclear healing
Nuclear healing, to erase all human forms
Nuclear healing

A new beginning is the only thing we need
To hope that future could us bring the hate for greed

Corruption, religions, obsessions
Can't case all the pain that we've got in
Our souls, in our brains and in our veins

None of the creatures can't avoid this dying fate
And we can't do nothing because it's too late
I'm the witness of the end of the world
I'm the madman that has pushed the red button

Nuclear healing, to erase all human forms
Nuclear healing
Nuclear healing, to erase all human forms
Nuclear healing

Twenty-first century, countdown has just begun
I'm looking forward to nuclear holocaust
