Forever I'll search the meaning of my disease
The answer is not closer, my heart won't stop to bleed

Foresee the past and analyze the future
I see flashes through my brain
Tryin' to release the pain that chokes my mind
And now runs through my veins
'Cause I can't breathe without this selfish greed
A new life will rise from ruins

Awakening of a new consciousness
The eve of a new inner age
My chaotic age

No matters when sadness will take control on Earth
I'm waiting the hour when power will mean reason to be killed

Foresee the past and analyze the future
I see flashes through my brain
Tryin' to release the pain that chokes my mind
And now runs through my veins
'Cause I can't breathe without this selfish greed
A new life will rise from ruins

Awakening of a new consciousness
The eve of a new inner age
My chaotic age

Forever I'll search the meaning of my disease
The answer is not closer, my heart won't stop to bleed
