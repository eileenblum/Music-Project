I lived my life as an immutable equilibrium
But I forgot to close my soul from things that I could hear
Years passed by and things went on without giving a damn
But in my heart anger still grew and now the time is come for me

To let the rage flow in my veins and gather all the hatred that
Was sleeping in my mind and now it's ready to explode
I've been blind for too long and simulate that everything was good
But now the time is over and I am sick and tired of it

My eyes (are) now opened
I want to see the truth
A great illusion is
What lies behind my hate

False illusions and unfulfilled promises
I want to crumble all these walls that you had made to
Hide the truth and all the things that you have done
To keep me from knowing how life really is

I am ready to make my own fate
I am ready to break this shroud of false
I am free to do what I want to do
I am safe from lies that you still tell me

My eyes (are) now opened
I want to see the truth
A great illusion is
What lies behind my hate

I lived my life as an immutable equilibrium
But I forgot to close my soul from things that I could hear
Years passed by and things went on without giving a damn
But in my heart anger still grew and now the time is come for me

To let the rage flow in my veins and gather all the hatred that
Was sleeping in my mind and now it's ready to explode
I've been blind for too long and simulate that everything was good
But now the time is over and I am sick and tired of it

My eyes (are) now opened
I want to see the truth
A great illusion is
What lies behind my hate
Hate
