Moral decay
Values decline

This is my life surrounded and blinded
By what you want for me
Indoctrinated to follow all your patterns
To be one of the most
My life has been ruled by schemes that I can't bear
By chains for my mind

I can see now clear into my mind
What's left to do to satisfy
The need of living that for years
You made me give up

I don't need no sorcery 'cause what
You made me it's not a spell but just
A fuckin' try to annihilate my personality

Youth corruption
Mental rapes

It's time to release what lies inside of me
No more a slave
Erasing you and all you forced me to be
Spreading your blood

Dressed in blood
I see your blood
Flowing out of you and then
Cover me
Hot and red
Through my hands is spilling out
In your eyes
Fear shines bright
Lightening in me the rage
For your life
Consciousness
Leaves your minds
And increases in me the hate
For the time
I have wasted
And the things I left behind
For you
Smashing you
With my hands

I can feel adrenaline
Flow in me, flowing in me

Lies!

Desecrate you, exasperate you
Hanging you on a rising tree
You can't escape me, closer to me
You can't find my truth

Now I am free from your influence
I can live my life
Following what I find it's right for me
I'll do my way
