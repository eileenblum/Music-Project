Detachment from reality
Controls and eases my will of life
Penetrating me
Twisting all I see

Now I stand alone, lost in my thoughts
Consumed by my own soul

Caress of death reveal what I am
What lies inside my head

Penetrate in me
This fucking existence

Can you see my brain? Trapped in this reality
That you still call life

Crossed by terror and addicted to pain
I want to burn my world

Loneliness is giving me the
Strength to destroy my existence

Die!

So my time has come, I don't give a fuck of God
Life has been my holy cross

Goodbye to hell, take my disposable soul
And rape it if you want

Pain inside my head
Still penetrate in me

Death
