I saw your eyes in the dark of the night
I saw your eyes full of tears fading in the emptiness of their minds

Your eyes has turned into a bitter laugh
I can see the pain that you've felt that night
You ask for peace and endless oblivion
No one can heal and let you turn back

No turning back my darling

You look at me to realize your suicide
You look at me to complete your last desire

Disturbing the silence
Echoes of an insane violence

You were alone and you didn't know how the world goes on
A waste of flesh was your fate, that's what they decided
They were sweating, they were spitting on your innocence
They seemed a thousand, a thousand to blame

You're looking at me to realize your suicide
Still looking at me to complete your last desire

You're crying (crying)
The day is dying with your smile
I can't hold you like I used to do
I'll keep the promise, I'll do

Disturbing the silence
Echoes of an insane violence

I'll take your lives
I'll give you what you have taken to me
I'm closing the circle, I'll set her free
Breakin' the silence to leave her be
I won't see her suffer no more

Now close your eyes and sleep, my love
