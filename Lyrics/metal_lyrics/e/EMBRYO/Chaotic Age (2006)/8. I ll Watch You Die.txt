The hour has come
To take my revenge
It's been long time ago when
You've written your end

I swore: "I'll watch you die"
Your pain is now my lust
Watching you die
Blood to fulfill my desire

You broke my happiness
When you tortured my bride
You torn her body
After annihilating her mind

I swore: "I'll watch you die"
Your pain is now my lust
Watching you die

I cut your skin and I break your bones
Slowly I watch your blood spill from your eyes
You scream in pain and my laughs are growin'
You curse my name like I did for my whole life

Die (Fuckin' bastard)
Die (And suffer like I did)
Burn (To beat my revenge)
Relish (Your funeral rite)

I swore: "I'll watch you die"
Your pain is now my lust

I'll watch you die
I'm watching you die
You're dying
Ah, ah ah... You're dead
