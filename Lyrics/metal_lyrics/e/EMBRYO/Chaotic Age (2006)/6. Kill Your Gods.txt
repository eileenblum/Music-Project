Look at the world we live
Religions don't stop to kill
The hatred for what you don't know
Increases the pain they brought
Mankind is still so blind
It still don't realize

Kill your gods, tear 'em apart
Kill your gods, be the one

Ain't no god, ain't no saviour
Ain't no shelter in god's behavior

Children cannot know
That you have lost control
You buy peace with a gun
You rape in the name of Allah
Illusion to do the right thing
Excuses to make a bloodshed

Kill your gods, tear 'em apart
Kill your gods, be the one
Kill, kill

And they don't know why

I want to choose my fate
And you don't even try to blame me
You're puppets on blood stained hands
Who lead you to the bomb men
You think you will live forever
But you don't know that there's no heaven

Kill your gods, tear 'em apart
Kill your gods, be the one

Ain't no god, ain't no saviour
Ain't no shelter in god's behavior

And I want to kill your gods
