People look at the world as a place of glowing feasts
The fair of luxury, an exhibition of bliss

Creatures of God, the flatterer of indifference
He made this world and left it to its wane
Aware of the direction (that) society would (have) taken
He left the clues of his wicked plan

The haze is vanishing to let us know the way
To a wretched future, our shattered legacy

Creatures of God, the flatterer of indifference
He made this world and left it to its wane

The human lunacy is withering the earth
Too late to apologize and repent

War
The narrow minds have prevailed
The eerie omens have turn into reality
Our humbled lives are quickly slipping out into remorse and regret

Nothing will last

The shades of being puppets in a bleak play
Cling our minds and lead us to hate

Creatures of God, the flatterer of indifference
He made this world and left it to its wane
Aware of the direction (that) society would (have) taken
He left the clues of his wicked plan

He created the illusions (that) we commonly know as lives
We bore our sufferings in his gameâ¦
