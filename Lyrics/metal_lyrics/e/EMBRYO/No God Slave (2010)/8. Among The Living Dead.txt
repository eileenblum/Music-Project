Youâre spending all the time on chasing to homologize
Each other thoughts, each other empty minds
Youâre lying on this Earth like ground zero ruins
Bewildered, unable to control your lives

I am not as
All you want
Iâm alone among
The living dead

Your lives are flowing through the cracks of your society
Behind a smile, behind your false morality
I donât know if you donât want or if you canât reject
Are you so blind? Maybe too coward to regret

I was born naked
Your God forsaken me
No control on my head
I own ideas and desires
Nothing can dominate my thoughts
Or shape my dreadful soul
Eradicate my independence
From mankind
I canât wake up every morning
And walk through these streets
So full of dying living

Youâre stuffing all your minds with cheating and empty lies
With louder laughs, itâs easier not to hear the cries
The only cure you need is a collective aphasia
To listen to your thoughts, to escape from apathy

I am not as
All you want
Iâm alone among
The living dead

You are too stupid to realize
That youâre just spinning in the glance of your eyes
You are surviving like there wouldnât be any way out
Youâd better die; youâd better leave this void behind

Iâm alone among the living dead
