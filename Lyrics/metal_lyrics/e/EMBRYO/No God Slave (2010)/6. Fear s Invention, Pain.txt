The inner weakness of human nature
Is to worry about the things it holds
Wasting time and borrowing future
To build richness for your family vaults

Lending your lives to escape troubles and fears
Make your pain rising and increase your tears

We were all born without any fears
But the decisions we took changed our (point of) view
Iâm not afraid even if death is near
You sweat and tremble even (if) someone cries wolf

Lending your lives to escape troubles and fears
Make your pain rising and increase your tears

Fearâs invention â¦ pain!

You are obsessed by jealousy and greed
And they became the source of your pain
You think that life is gain and not breathe
Iâm not like you and that is to blame

Lending your lives to escape troubles and fears
Make your pain rising and increase your tears

The inner weakness of human nature
Is to worry about the things it holds
Wasting time and borrowing future

To build richness for your family
