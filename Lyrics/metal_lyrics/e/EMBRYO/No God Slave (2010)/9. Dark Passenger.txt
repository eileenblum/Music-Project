I always thought (that) there was something in me
I didnât know what but I couldnât release
The quest for blood seems to all so bizarre
The time went on and I wanted to touch

The cold and darkness of a wicked heart
The heat when I tear it apart
The razor blade shines through the night
I need to see the death in your eyes
In my eyes

I searched for the meaning and for someone like me
Iâve got to pretend and to hide to resist
In a world where I canât find my place
Adrenaline is my only revenge

I do the job that no one dares to do
I clean the streets from rapists and thieves
I am a hero of modern times
(But) Iâve got to hide until Iâll find the reason why
The reason why

Flashbacks in my head
Of a broken past
My mother butchered
Everywhere (there) was blood
I was just a child
But I was not alone
Then (was) born the dark
Passenger of my soul

Then (was) born the dark
Passenger of my soul

Enigma revealed through the sands of time
I belong to violence not to poor mankind
I closed the circle I know who I am
(Iâve got to) keep on pretending to protect myself

I always thought (that) there was something in me
Now I know what (is) but I still couldnât release it
People are not ready to meet the real me
I do the right but theyâre too hypocrites

I do the job that no one dares to do
I clean the world from rapists and thieves
I am a hero of modern times
(But) Iâve got to hide until Iâll find the reason why
