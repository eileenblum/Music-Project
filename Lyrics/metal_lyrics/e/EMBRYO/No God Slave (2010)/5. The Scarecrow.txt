He can see the lies
Deep into your beliefs
He knows your mind
And all the fears within

You canât avoid the control
Of your guardian scarecrow
You canât escape, he lies (on you)
From the day of your birth
He lies in wait to celebrate
The failure of your life
He laughs and smiles while
You shed tears and desperately cry

You can feel him next
To you in disgrace
You donât understand
Why heâs always so close (to you)

You canât avoid the control
Of your guardian scarecrow
You canât escape, he lies (on you)
From the day of your birth
He lies in wait to celebrate
The failure of your life
He laughs and smiles while
You shed tears and desperately cry

Youâre falling down
And searching for an
Helping hand

Youâre screaming loud
To exorcise the fear
To die alone

Heâs watching you
With his scary eyes

You lie paralyzed
The life is leaving you
Now you can see his smile
Forged to heal the joy

You canât avoid the control
Of your guardian scarecrow
You canât escape, he lies (on you)
From the day of your birth
He lies in wait to celebrate
The failure of your life
He laughs and smiles while
You shed tears and cry
