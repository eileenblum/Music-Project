Human race, your time has come
I hold your future in my blood-stained hands
Youâve grown and spread like a virus
Infecting this Earth
You thought to persist unpunished
âtill the end of your time

I will end what your Gods have forsaken
Iâll create what your nightmares imagined
This is (my) democratic mankind slaughter

You have no chance to tip the scale
In favor of your pathetic behaviors
You keep at crushing everything
You find on your way
Now you are ready to tear
Each other life away

I will end what your Gods have forsaken
Iâll create what your nightmares imagined
This is (my) democratic mankind slaughter

Iâll wait the descent of the darkness
To cover the ground with the remains of your bodies
Iâll let the blood spill from your hearts
And feed the Earth as it did so far

I wonât look at the color of your skin
Or the color of your souls
I donât mind if youâre good (or) if youâre bad
(Or) if youâre anything else
I am the justice, not human or divine,
I donât belong to wrong and right

I will end what your Gods have forsaken
Iâll complete what your nightmares created

This is (my) democratic mankind slaughter
