All the time I thought
That life was a familiar favor
All the time so far
That I opened my eyes to the truth
All the reasons to be
Grant for such a divine gift
Have changed into the shameful doubt
That Iâm the fruit from a demon seed

I recognized my fate
Demonic signs
The scars and wounds
Wonât be divine again

I have learned to use
My mind to look through the world
Free from all divine
Influences into my life
Thatâs the reason why
You have turned your back to my stare
Afraid to see in my eyes
The emptiness of your religious minds

I recognized my fate
Demonic signs
The scars and wounds
Wonât be divine again

Lies
You tell me lies everyday
Every moment of my life
Was filled with hypocritical
Lies
The time has come to lead my life
Into a different way
I took my existence in my hands
And I want to be the owner of my fate
Iâm not the devil
But I wonât be any God slave

Finally I know
Who I have to thank for this pain
Iâm not who you thought
Who you wished to lead to
Your merciful God
Waiting for my blind devotion
I will die alone
And nothing will receive me after death

I realized my choice
Atheistic mind
My flesh and bones

Will feed the ground again
