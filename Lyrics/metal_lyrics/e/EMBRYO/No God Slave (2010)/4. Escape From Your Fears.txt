I wake up in this fuckinâ morning
Tryinâ to find if there is something new
Iâm still trapped in this useless world
That it seems to me like a little four walls room

With no windows and no doors
I see changes growing near
Your failure is so close
And your shame is now real

If youâre not ready for me
Iâll crawl like death into your lives
You wonât forget me
Too late to pray for heavenâs hand

Wait for me
Condemned to sacrifice your dreams
And disappear into the fire

A dynasty to blame
And completely eradicate

Youâre in a corner, trapped
Lost to yourselves
You pray for turning back
Youâd like to breath the air
And gaze at the sky
Prepare to join the ground

I see the terror in the depths of your eyes
Your hopes and smiles smashed by sad reality
Kneel and pray if you think it would be useful
But I canât think that your prayers will come true

âcause youâre nothing else than dust
You have to drown into your tears
Youâre sentencing for your lust
Too late to escape from your fears
