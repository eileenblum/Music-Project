You hid from the neon lights
The embrace of darkness was your only mate
You lie in the camerasâ eyes (now)
The downgrade of humanity between your thighs

âWhy is he doing it to me?â
âHow can man be so mean?â

You try to protect your mind
Changing your body into an empty doll
But his eyes
Penetrate the intimacy of your world

âWhy donât you let my dreams live on?â
âWhy do you want to fray my soul?â

âGod damned, when will I give my deliverance?â
Condemned, you hope to die to heal the suffering
One way left, the throbbing vein crossing his dirty neck

Bite, donât slacken your hold
And then bite again until his blood fulfill your rage
Your rage

You, now, (look) deep into his eyes
And find yourself alive despite his will to kill you
He lies helpless and dead
Inanimate puppet on your blood-stained chest

âGod, was he one of your sons?â

âTell me now what is right and wrong!â
