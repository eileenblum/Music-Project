No one comes to feed me
No one cares to heal me
No one needs to save me
No one dares to look into my eyes

I feel like a lost word
Trapped somewhere and somehow
In the blank pages of an unwritten book
Mankind looks at me
Just like a fool or a madman
But it doesnât know that in my world all is full of grace

Grace is in my arms
Trapped in this strait-jacket
Grace in this white room
Empty for your blind eyes but so crowded for my mind
Gray is your life
A perennial pursuit for a formal perfection

I can see deep through you
The nothingness of your souls
A black shroud on your emotions
Choked by your plastic goals

Finally your time has come
Now decadence and decay
Leave scars on your faces
And damage like a surgical blade

I feel like a lost word
Trapped somewhere and somehow
In the blank pages of an unwritten book
Mankind looks at me
Just like a fool or a madman
But it doesnât know that in my world all is full of grace

Grace is in my arms
Trapped in this strait-jacket
Grace in this white room
Empty for your blind eyes but so crowded for my mind
Gray is your life
A perennial pursuit for a formal perfection

No one (will) leave to feed
(I donât) need anyone to save me
I took my decision
I donât want to be part
Of this ridiculous
Circus of puppets
Trapped in a pathetic screenplay
Until they die
