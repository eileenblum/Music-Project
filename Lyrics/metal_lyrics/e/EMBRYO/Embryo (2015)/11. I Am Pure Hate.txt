I feel if unfolding in the darkness of my soul,
roots feeding on my poisoned blood.

I can't stand here watching this demise,
I can't pretend that all I see is fine.

I feel it growing.

I can't accept the ignorance of mankind,
I can't support the way they cling to life.

I feel it flowing.

Like a bombshell
about to detonate;
focused on disintegrate.
I feel the pressure of my deepest hate
devour my resistance to kill.

It's now controlling me.

I let blood fill the words in my throat,
I let scorn lead fulfilment to my thoughts.

I am pure hate!

Starting to annihilate your farce,
ready to end our harmful lapse.
