Lies are all that choke my desperate
cries, the silencer of my exhausting thoughts.

I reached the point
where everything is disgusting me.

Behind a smile I play my part,
in disguise to rule my heart;
manipulate my consciousness
to feed the best, my emptiness.

Condemned to wear a mask of kindness,
hypocrisy to hide my deep-rooted sadness.

Cast aside to stand out from this reality

and when I stare at your gentle illusion,
I don't understand if you're truly aware
of your condition of seeming affairs,
or you're just preparing
to a granted disillusion.

I reached the point
where everything is disgusting me.

Behind a smile I play my part,
in disguise to rule my heart;
manipulate my consciousness
to feed the beast, my emptiness.
