My pounding void, my lack of empathy;
my need to swallow the cancer of mankind,
tears its uselessness apart.

I started feeling this exhausting strain
when my emotion steered my naive mind;
in the beginning
I thought that was to disdain,
but in my veins the hate started flowing,
giving me the consciousness
that I was for sure one of a kind,
that there wasn't only
a way to follow to fulfill

my pounding void, my lack of empathy;
my need to swallow the cancer of mankind,
tears its uselessness apart.

My first amusements were almost scum:
easy to overcome and puppets
to improve my detachment,
a way to practice how to get them pain,
the path to follow to achieve a superior mind.

Deep anguish, deep anguish and decay
bring cowards, bring cowards to unveil
the nature, the nature of their blind
selfishness, selfishness and vile minds.

Stabbing reality, watching it bleed,
tear down the shroud of sanity.

Once was a murder, now it's something more:
the art of suffering
is how you can label what I do;
lacerate the flesh to annihilate defenses,
empty a body is the sweetest way to fill.

My pounding void, my lack of empathy;
my need to swallow the cancer of mankind,
tears its uselessness apart.
