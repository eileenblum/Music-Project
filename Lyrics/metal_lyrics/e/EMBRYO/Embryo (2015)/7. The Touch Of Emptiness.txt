I felt trapped in this (in)humanity
and even end was not (a) new beginning.

I let the abyss look in my soul,
scratching the surface of my own world.

Trivial, your rush to socialize each other,
oblivion, (the) nest of (all) inane lovers,
transient like all the lives you're living,
'cause everything will bring you anything.

I looked the abyss become my soul,
a warm touch to my inner void.

For too long I waited for something
that could become a comfortable shelter;
do I need a shelter now
that I felt the hand of emptiness caress my soul?

Let loose the abyss dwelling (in) my heart,
the gentle touch of emptiness cherish my arms.

No more sinking into your sparkling
fullness of blankness,
no more deceiving with your
shining proof of blindness.
I am darkness!
