I don't remember when I have started
looking around
with my dreams completely departed.

Blind eyes wide opened
watching tales in disguise,
empty eyes that I want to close
staring at your paradise.

I always keep on thinking that your lives
are nothing but a miserable play.

Blind eyes wide opened
watching tales in disguise,
empty eyes that I want to close
staring at you, parasites.

I see the world so clearly
and it's time to expose your lies,
I can't release what's in my mind,
I can't break out your fears.

I stand here
trapped in this unbearable inaction,
an unintentional
deprivation of consciousness.

Blind eyes wide opened
watching tales in disguise,
empty eyes that I want to close
staring at your paradise.

This is so unreal and I can't comprehend
why I keep on staying here
I need my mind to crush.
