Once I thought that it was outside
the noise, the chaos, the unbearable cries.
I learned to close my ears,
I learned to hide your tears.

A vital pursuit of silence
to bear this dreary decline.

Reality started to pass me by,
day life, a screenplay to visualize.
A silent film is all I wanted,
a quiet place with no sounds that could bother.

A vital pursuit of silence
to bear this dreary decline.

In this lonely quest I sunk,

but now I've realized that chaos is inside me;
I've got to find a way to set me free.

How can I stop th thoughts in my head?
How can I avoid letting them flow?

I hear a voice among the many,
the ultimate whisper of control.

A deadly pursuit of silence
to leave this dreary decline.
