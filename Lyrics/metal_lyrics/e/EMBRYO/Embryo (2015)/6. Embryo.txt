Darkness and blankness and blindness
are the only imprintings in my brain;
void and emptiness and loneliness
are the only mates in this

useless lie, endless cry
in this seemingly golden cage
that you call simple life;
scavenger of all my rage.

I never asked for this time
to watch my hopes pouring down;
I'm a shade of doubt in your minds
waiting for my sun to set.

Even if I was born,
am I really alive?
Or just a collection of cells
intended to die?

I never asked for this time
to watch my hopes pouring down;
I'm a shade of doubt in your minds
waiting for my sun to set.

I found a reason
in a conscious self-destruction,
'cause nothing is sweeter
that chasing an elusive end;
maybe she's playing with me, deceiving me
that I can win without knowing
who's the prey.

I never asked for this time
to watch my hopes pouring down;
I'm a shade of doubt in your minds
waiting for my sun to set,
to set me free.
