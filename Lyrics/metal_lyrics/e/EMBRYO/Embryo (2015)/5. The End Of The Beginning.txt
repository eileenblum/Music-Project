Once I decided where to lead my life,
hiding in disguise and floating on mankind.

Now I'm aware no one will compel (me).

The end of the beginning,
I'll let hate and venom feed my heart;
the end of the beginning,
mercy and forgiveness will be torn apart.

I closed my essence in an emotional exile,
keeping a low profile like ordinary men;
the time has come for me to leave it all behind,
digging deeper where fear can't descend.

The end of the beginning,
I'll let hate and venom feed my heart;
the end of the beginning,
mercy and forgiveness will be torn apart.
Apart!

I embraced independence,
I embraced... hate!

No more pretending to listen to your complaints,
an ongoing praise to your mediocrity.

The end of the beginning,
I'll let hate and venom feed my heart;
the end of the beginning,
mercy and forgiveness will be torn apart.

The scars of my soul
will start bleeding anger and disdain,
for your
comprehension of the human failures,
for your
kind-hearted sharing of each other leisure,
for your
senseless emotional dependence,
fire!
To cleanse me from you all!
