I started a journey to reach eternity,
crossing my human being,
the limit to achieve.

The door to the abyss
to the purest me,
where mankind has no meaning
and my animal (side) shall rest.

Through all the disillusions,
through all my soul diseases;
tossed between independence
and the frailty of a (caress in) a dream.

The door to the abyss
to the purest me,
swallowed by knowledge
to consciousness oblivion.

I walked a path paved with regrets,
a painful struggle
among many barriers;
now that I faced
the darkness of the essence,
I'll let my weakness sinking
into equilibrium,
into the cosmic depths of universe,
the cold embrace of infinite,
becoming part of everything,
burning like a shooting star.

Outside the time keeps ticking,
inside is for evermore,
humanity keeps spinning
in its hypocrisy.

The door to the abyss
to the purest me,
away from insignificant
and useless behaviors.
