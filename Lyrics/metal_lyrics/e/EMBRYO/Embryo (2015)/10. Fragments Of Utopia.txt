Now that all is gone
I can analyze what happened between us:

an illusion, delusions to emotive seclusion;
connection, depression
through heartbeat's inventions.

When I open my heart,
I closed my eyes to obvious evidence:

an illusion, delusions to emotive seclusion;
connection, depression
through heartbeat's inventions.

Thrown in darkness,
torn apart,
back from blindness,
forsaken heart,
incorporate sadness,
fragments of utopia.

I'll be the darkness looking into you,
the creeping monster in your soul;
the fire burning your heart
and when you'll think to get rid of me,
you'll be alone, empty and torn.

No one is at it seems, a bitter lesson carved in my skin:

confusion replaced by a sad disillusion,
convictions, decisions,
my heart of disconnection.
