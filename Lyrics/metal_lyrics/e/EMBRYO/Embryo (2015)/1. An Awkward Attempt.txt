Constantly scared with anguish
intoxicated by regrets;
I sunk into a blindness
where sensibility became my quicksand.

A voice in my head kept on
yelling (at) me to stop to stray.

Anaesthetized with feelings
weakened by the quest for joy;
surrounded by your empathy
I lost my strength in your reality.

A voice in my head kept on
yelling (at) me to stop to stray.

Isolation, the call of solitude
showed me the way to
isolation, a long gone haven where
I used to be me.

Let flow the essence of my thoughts,
make my soul the cradle of my words,
an awkward attempt to comply
with your twisted normality.

I hate (you) rotten humanity,
(you) hypocritical charity,
you mean greedy misery and mercy;
I am your "broken parody",
lone personality,
insane misanthropy in your lives.
I am!
