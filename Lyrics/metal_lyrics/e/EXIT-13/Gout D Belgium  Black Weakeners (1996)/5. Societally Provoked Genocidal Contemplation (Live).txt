[Music: O'Donnell, Lyrics: Yurkiewicz]

This whole world is fucking sick!!!
Human stupidity has made me crazed!
Insanity frees my mind to wander....
I gleefully ponder humanity's murder!

Thoughts of slaughter fill my head.
I want to make all humans dead.
To free the world of the ills
that manifest from diseased wills.
My remedy for Earth's situation
is total human being negation!!!
Radical global extermination
The venting of my crazed frustration
Plants and animals would rejoice
Freed from evil human ploys
I've been dismissed as being sick...
"environmentally romantic",
but I will have the final laugh
as my own species feels my wrath!!!

No more factories polluting the air I breath!
No more authority blatantly surppressing me!
No more politics, mere games for the ethically sick!
No more fighting wars, human beings will destroy no more!!!

No I'm alone, in solitude I freely roam...
but I'm going mad contemplating the good
times past...so I enact a frazzled,
but calmimng new plan,
splattering my brains across this now free land!
