Westmalle Triple, Golden Carolus
Belgian Alcoholocaust!!!

Get startin' with Hoegaarden!
I'm flash whacked on Pauwel Kwak!

I've raised many a glass with St. Sixtus
and deviled my brain with Duvel
My mind is as high as the heavens,
but my liver is burning in Hell!!!

Belgian Alcoholocaust!!!

The Abbey ales just don't fail!
Several tripples will leave you crippled!!!

Belgium is literally heaven on Earth for the beer afficionado!
No other country can boast of more distinct, individualistic styles,
so rich and complex in character. Whether it's the unique lambics
or the top fermenting, bottle conditioned strong ales,
Belgium's beers deserve the most sincere reverence!
"This is drink most sensuous"
