[Music: Terrorizer / Lyrics: Oscar Garcia]

Can't escape all your worries
Endless sorrow, pain and suffer
Can't escape your emotions
Enslavement be the world you choose

You work so hard, all for nothing
Your dreams are shattered
Your goals destroyed
No-one listens to what we stand for
So why even try do you really care

The struggle continues as the cries of pain
Peace can no longer rest in your mind
The world you choose is fucked already
So stop dreaming and face reality
