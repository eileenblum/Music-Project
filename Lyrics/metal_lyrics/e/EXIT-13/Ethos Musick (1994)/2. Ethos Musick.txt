[Music: O'Donnel, Lyrics: Yurkiewicz]

There are so many fucking problems
the human species seems insane
What kind of persuasion is needed
to affect benefical change?!?

ETHOS MUSICK!

We've got to find a way to halt
all global devastation
Before most life on the planet dies
from malevolent manipulation

ETHOS MUSICK!

There's no more time for calm discussion
We've gotta finally totally purge
All perpetrators of crimes against nature
in a definitively life affirming upsurge NOW!!!
