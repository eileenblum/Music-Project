[Music: O'Donnell, Lyrics: Yurkiewicz]

There is a fantastic book which I adamantly recommend
and after reading it you'll never be able to eat the same way again!
This book details the horrors of meat production at its "best"
and casts a glaring light on many problems interconnectedness

The flesh production industries
all operate insidiously
Chemically ridden fat is glamorized
while torture and slaughter are disguised
Epidemics of heart disease, cancer and obesity
Storing up unwittingly dioxin and DDT...

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT!

You'll be profoundly horrified as you realize the indoctrination
implemented by industry upon the people of this nation
irreversible chemical pollution and excesive resource waste
have given animal based products a positivly unpalable taste!

I'd like to thank John Robbins for composing such an important tome
This environmental dietary bible should be the keystone of every home
The information contained in these pages will certainly make you realize
That for the preservation of life on earth everyone must change their lives!
