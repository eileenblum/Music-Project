[Music: O'Donnell, Lyrics: Yurkiewicz]

Nature contaminated knowingly by man,
blind striving for profits, life denied by our plans...
REEVALUATE!

The time has beset us, we must act with haste.
to rediscover a life-style devoid of destruction and waste!
REEVALUATE YOUR FUCKING LIVES!!!

Man is a creature of immeasurable ingenuity.
but his greed has facilitated an environmental killing spree!!!
