I don't turn a phrase for the aim of profundity,
I only` wish to alert you to your impending reality!
A human centered view of this planet has so far exhibited.
That it will reduce the earth to being no longer inhabited by life!

Destruction! Pollution! Body and mind disillusioned!
How could humanity actively bring about the earth's ruin???
Why has a collective conscience allowed the furrow of extinction to be plowed?!?

I don't pen these rants for the plaudits of some critic!
I only wish to air the mind of a depressed, confused cynic!
To make you think, my only goal, I will not be inhibited!
But I realize that in the hardcore scene mental growth is limited!!!
