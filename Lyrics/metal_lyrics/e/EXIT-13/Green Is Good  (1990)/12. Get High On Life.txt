We're always depressed because this world is a fucking mess.
Watching the oppressed be manipulated and regressed.
In Washington D.C. politicians sit and dwaddle away our time.
Scamming bucks and discrete fucks as innocent millions cry and die.

Corrupted government actions.
A power - mad faction.
Consciousless self - serving shifts.
They get high off of it!

We're always disturbed by George Bush's untrue words.
And from what I've observed the truth needs to be heard.
But it's too late, the "whimps' our leader, and Quayle is not far behind.
What's in store for the 21st century when we elect those without a mind?
