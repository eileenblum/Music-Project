Earth as organism - Gaia
"Self - sustaining biota" - Gaia
"Total planetary being" - Gaia
A theory of Lovelock...

Nature has dissymmetry,
Disorder known by entropy,
Life seems to be an anomaly!

It's imperative that we respect the earth!
Realize it's total worth, worship it with glee and mirth...
DO NOT KILL IT!!!
