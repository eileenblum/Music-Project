Topics are discussed, personal biases thrust, yet meaningfulness is a must,
Too much blatant stupidity, nonsensical trends followed rigidly,
Is it too painful to deal with reality?!?
Various attempts at lyrical verbosity, have gone awry and concluded
in linguistic atrocities!
Though we aim for contextual sophistry, articulating frustrations sure ain't easy!
Wanting to avoid tedious references to goriness, and transcend the
glut of foolish trendiness,
Has given rise to band member unhappiness, but commitment to the
purpose of lyrical usefulness!
