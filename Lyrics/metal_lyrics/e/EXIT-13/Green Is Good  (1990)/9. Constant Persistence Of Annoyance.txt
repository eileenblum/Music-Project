Your words should be solidified and sold as manure!
Your life is like a crippling illness, and for it there's no cure!
Your attitudes are like disco dancing - silly and outdated!
Your ego is like a helium balloon that's incredibly overinflated!
Sometimes I ponder your existence, and hope for the day that you do
something right!
You commit the felony of staying alive! Emitting stupidity is your life!!!!
Your brain is on the same level as a small bucket of dirt!
Your intelligence is like a blow to the scrotum - it fucking hurts!!
The open-mindedness you claim to possess is totally nonexistent!
But the way you succeed in annoying the world is constant and persistent!!
