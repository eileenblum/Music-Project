[a) Fixed And Dilated]

I can taste my own venom
In the back of my throat
Iâve kept it hidden
As long as I could

The angry child inside me
Baptized in gentility
Was raised on cruelty
In a violent world

The urge to kill still tickles
Like a maggot that wiggles
In the skin of a kitten
And these words that Iâve written
Wonât deaden the nerve

You donât look blind
And yet you wonder why
We are this way
Itâs as plain as the blood in our veins

I have always turned the other cheek
As though the face Iâd strike,
Would be my own

And all the fists that Iâve denied
Conspire against my gentle side
When mercy leaves I am diseased
A plague of rage come over me

Are we here to pray for each other?
Or are we here to prey on each other?

On each other?
For each other?

[b) Bloody And Unfocused]

All my anger
And hatred
Once turned inward
Now spun outward

A tornado of shattered glass
Bloody and unfocused

If you think
For one minute
You can overlook me,
You are wrong

Through music,
Through art
Or through violence
I will not be ignored

I would rather empty a clip
Into your brain
And then mine
Than walk away from this
Without satisfaction

Did you hear me?
I would rather kill you
Than walk away from this
Without satisfaction
