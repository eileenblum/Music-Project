Feeling ugly and getting scared
And itâs all so empty when no oneâs there
I feel the pounding, pounding, pounding fist
Inside my head explode
As memories of my disease
Rip through my mind and rape my soul

I need youâ¦I need youâ¦I need you
To make me feel pretty
You make me feel so pretty

My angels hold me,
They gently wrap me in their wings
And I feel safe here â safe from everything
I feel the pounding,
Pounding crucifix
Inside my head explode
And even eve in eden
Couldnât hide that smile
When the truth was told

I need youâ¦I need youâ¦I need you
To make me feel holy
Holy mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners

I want to be your everything
I want to be your Christ
Oh honey let me, let me be your savior
Let me, let me be your life
And I would love to have you love me
Itâs just that you could never trust me

I need you, I need you, I need you
To make me feel pretty
I need you, I need you, I need you
To make me feel holy
I need you, I need you, I need you
To make me feel dirty
I need you, I need you,
I need you, I need you.
