[a) Among Them]

Pictures of god
And sin
And the pain
Iâve caused
Others and myself
Float through
My mind
Like crippled angels
Who can neither land
Nor find peace

Sadly,
I find myself among them

[b) Disfigured]

Somebody help me,
Somebody save me,
I want to drag
A blade across my face
Iâm in conflict
With that Christ again,
Like some unholy
Martyr whoâs dying for sin
I want to burn, yeah,
I want to bleed
You think Iâm kidding man,
Iâm real as real can be
Iâve been feeling
Those demons again,
Let my cross-eyed
Suicide of spirit begin

I feel tight, tight as a fist
And somehow blind
Like a mind full of ignorance
Turned away from the light
Pushed away from the light
Drawn away from the light
I wish Judas would kiss me,
And take me down,
Before I hurt the ones who love me now

I am disfigured, out of control
I am disfigured, let my face match my soul

Open your eyes Christ, donât turn away
All I do, I do for you
That your pain not be in vain
