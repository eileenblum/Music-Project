I feel myself falling
Down, down, down, down
When something pulls back
Hard against my throat

You can find me, you can find me
At the end of my rope
And you can find me, you can find me
At the end of my rope

Each day: one single strand
That choices twist as life demands
And I have blindly fashioned my own noose,
From all my days

I know I am only one lonely man,
One of a million empty souls who knows,
The fear and pain of being lost

I wish I had some lines and rhymes
To make you smile
Maybe next time, my child, Iâll find
That one hopeful song
