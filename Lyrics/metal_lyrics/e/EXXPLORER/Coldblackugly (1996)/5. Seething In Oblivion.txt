Here I am standing
And yet somehow crippled
A stone never thrown
Canât create its own ripples
Iâm a mouthful of spit
That gets lost in a drizzle
And now
That Iâm angry
Iâm fist âround a pistol
And every day brings me
A little bit closer to a
Bitter explosion of venom and piss
And all that Iâve seen
And all that Iâve been
Could never have made me ready for this

All I want to know is: do I have toâ¦?

I have nothing: I am nothing
More than anything
I want to be something
If itâs something you fear,
I donât care.
Just something

All I want to know is:
Do I have to fuckinâ
Kill someone?!

Look at you, look at me
Look at you and I see:
Victim and statistic
Look at you, look at me
Look at you and I see:
A victimâ¦a victim.

But now itâs time to let it goâ¦let it go
Before it takes me away â take me away
