Welcome to my void child
Welcome to a place where nothing grows

I am sickness
I am disease
I am worthless, I am nothing
I am the death of love it seems
And now Iâve taught you how to hate me
Like every other soul,
Iâve ever touched before
And I am sorry
God Iâm sorry

I am the wasteland
A heart of desert sand
A servant of lust and her demands
And I am snake
I am scorpion
I am walking evil, a cold and venomous one
I am, oh I can
I can only hurt you

I am the wasteland
I am the wasteland
I am the wasteland
I am the wasteland,
Never love the sand
