I know how you feel child
I share your disease
And I know what it means
To be alive in times like these
You feel like dyinâ

Are you: ugly and scared?
Turned away from the light?
At the end of your rope?
With no savior in sight?

But sometimes, out there,
Is a voice with wings that sings
And knows your name
And this is what she says:
âeverythingâs gonna be alrightâ

Iâve been where youâre goingâ to
Through what youâre goinâ through
And I am dyinâ to
Help you get through it alive

Everythingâs gonna be alright
Gonna be alright,
Gonna be alright,
â¦everythingâ gonna be alright

Open your eyes,
Yes youâve cried off to sleep
Your tears all have dried,
And theyâve washed the slate clean
The pain that you feel
Will just make you strong
And your wounds will all heal,
It wonât take too long

Alright, alrightâ¦
Everythingâs gonna
Be alright, yeah.
