These are words that paint a picture
A picture of love
Words not unspoken
Words not unclear
Words I fear sheâll never hear
Van Goghâs ear

Iâm not gonna break down
Iâm not gonna break down
Noâ¦not again
I donât want to break down
Please donât make me break down
Not again

My life: a still life
Where icicles cry
Tears fall like rain
Walls whisper her name
And I can hear through
Van Goghâs ear

Iâm not gonna break down
Iâm not gonna break down
Noâ¦not again
I donât want to break down
Please donât make me break down

All my faults open wide
And I fall down inside, my broken heart
