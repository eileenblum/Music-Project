Iâll cut myself open,
So that you can read me
And stretch my wound wide
Are you sure you can see?
Blood never lies
And I wonât deceive you
Open your eyes
And feast on the sight of the truth

Let the blood flow, let the words go
I wonât make it any clearer than that
If you donât understand me
Or canât comprehend me
Hereâs a pearl for swine:
I bleed in a rhyme
Iâm afraid I might die out here

I want to bleed for you
I want to bleed for you
I want you to bleed for me too
Bleed for me too. Like I for you

Where is the line that divides
Fiction from lies?
Blood floods over both of these,
Makes them small, like two drops in the seas

I get so tired of being lied to. Donât you?
