WILL THE FIRE IN THE SKY BURN FOREVER, OR CRUMBLE TO THE SEA
SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFETIME, IN FEAR OF WHAT MAY BE
DESPERATE EYES SCAN THE SKIES, AND HIDE IN SHAME
SO MANY SINS, WHERE DO WE PLACE THE BLAME

AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU RUN AND HIDE
OR GAZE RIGHT INTO HIS EYES
IF THE END IS NEAR, WILL YOU LIVE IN FEAR
OR GIVE IT JUST ONE MORE RIDE
AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU ROLL IN PAIN
OR SMILE WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME
WE ALL COME AND GO, AS THE CROW FLYS LOW

MANY MEN HAVE COME AND GONE, TO FIGHT THE FIGHT
TO RIGHT THE WRONG. THEY GIVE THEIR BLOOD,
THEY GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR YOU
MANY FIGHT FOR VENGEANCE CAUSE, AND VENGEANCE
RIDES AN ANGRY HORSE, AND MANY DIED
THEY STAY THEIR COURSE ITS TRUE

AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU RUN AND HIDE
OR LOOK HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE
IF THE END IS NEAR, WILL YOU LIVE IN FEAR
OR GIVE IT JUST ONE LAST RIDE
AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU ROLL IN PAIN
OR SMILE WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME
WE ALL COME AND GO, LET THE CROW FLY HIGH

THE FIRES BURN, IN DARKEST NIGHT, A RAY OF HOPE
OUR ONLY LIGHT, A DISTANT SOUND
THE TRUMPETS CALL FOR YOU
SONS OF VENGEANCE, HEAR MY CALL, AND WHEN WE SING
OUR VICTORY SONG , AND FROM THE WOMB
WE ALL ARE TORN IN TWO
ã
AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU RUN AND HIDE
OR LOOK HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE
IF THE END IS NEAR, WILL YOU LIVE IN FEAR
OR GIVE IT JUST ONE LAST RIDE
AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU ROLL IN PAIN
OR SMILE WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME
WE ALL COME AND GO, LET THE CROW FLY HIGH

AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU RUN AND HIDE
OR LOOK HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE
IF THE END IS NEAR, WILL YOU LIVE IN FEAR
OR GIVE IT JUST ONE LAST RIDE
AS THE CROW FLYS LOW, WILL YOU ROLL IN PAIN
OR SMILE WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME
WE ALL COME AND GO, WE ALL COME AND GO
WE ALL COME AND GO, LET THE CROW FLY HIGH
