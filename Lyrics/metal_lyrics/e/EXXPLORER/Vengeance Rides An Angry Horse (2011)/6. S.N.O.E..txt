SWEET LITTLE INNOCENCE, ANGELIC CHILD
SHE LIKE TO DRIVE THE OLD MEN CRAZY, SHE LOVES TO DRIVE THEM WILD
BRINGIN ALL THE YOUNG BOYS DOWN TO THEIR KNEES
SWEET LITTLE INNOCENCE, A DRINK IS ALL SHE NEEDS

FROM CITY STREETS SHE WANNA GET YA HIGH

SHEâS GOT, SWEET NECTAR OF EVIL
OH SHE GOT, OOOH

SWEET LITTLE ARROGANCE, DEMONIC SMILE
SHE LIKES TO DRIVE THE LONG WHITE WAVE, AND KEEP YOU UP FOR DAYS
COLD SWEAT UNDER HOT LIGHTS, INSIDE HER DARKNESS SHE SMILES
DIRTY LITTLE SWEET LITTLE CHILD, COME OUT FOR AWHILE

FROM CITY STREETS RIGHT OUTTA THE GUTTER
FROM CITY STREETS SHE WANNA GET YA HIGH

SHEâS GOT, OOH SWEET NECTAR OF EVIL
OH SHE GOT, SWEET

YEAH SHEâS GOT, SWEET NECTAR OF EVIL, EVIL, EVIL
SHE GOT, OOOH, YEAH SHE GOT, OOH
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OH SWEET
