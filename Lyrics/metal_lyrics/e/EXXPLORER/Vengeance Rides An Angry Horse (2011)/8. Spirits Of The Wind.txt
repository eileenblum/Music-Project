LISTEN TO THE WIND CAN YOU HEAR IT CRY, LIKE A LONLEY GHOST WHO REFUSED TO DIE - FORGOTTEN SPIRITS SEARCHING FOR THEIR PEACE, LEFT HERE TO DWELL THEIR SEARCH WILL NEVER CEASE - LISTEN TO THE WIND CAN YOU HEAR IT CRY, LIKE A LONG LOST SOUL, WHO WANTS TO LIVE AGAIN
FORGOTTEN ONES, GREAT WERE YOUR SINS LEFT FOR ETERNITY

SPIRITS OF THE WIND

LISTEN TO THE NIGHT, CAN YOU FEEL THE CHILL - SOMETHING SEEMS SO COLD
SO UNFULFILLED, IS SOMEONE SPEAKING, TRYING TO BE HEARD - ONCE YOUâRE THERE, YOU CANâT BE RETURN - LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS CANâT YOU HEAR THEM CRY, LIKE A DISTANT VOICE, OR AN ANGRY SHOUT
SHOUT TO THE DEVIL, COME AND TAKE MY SOUL, LEFT FOR ETERNITY

SPIRITS OF THE WIND

I HEAR YOU CALLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I TURN TO LOOK THEREâS NO ONE THERE - I HEAR YOU CRYING OUT LIKE CHILDREN IN THE DARK
BUT THEREâS NO ONE THERE, THEREâS NO ONE THERE

I HEAR YOU CALLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I TURN TO LOOK, BUT THEREâS NO ONE THERE - I HEAR YOU CRYING OUT LIKE CHILDREN IN THE NIGHT, BUT THEREâS NO ONE THERE, THEREâS NO ONE THERE

LISTEN TO THE WIND CAN YOU HEAR IT CRY, LIKE A LONLEY GHOST WHO REFUSED TO DIE - FORGOTTEN SPIRITS SEARCHING FOR THEIR PEACE, LEFT TO DWELL THEIR SEARCH WILL NEVER CEASE 
LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS CANâT YOU HEAR THEM CRYING OUT, LIKE A DISTANT VOICE, OR AN ANGRY SHOUT - SHOUT TO THE DEVIL, COME AND TAKE MY SOUL, 
LEFT FOR ETERNITY

SPIRITS OF THE WIND, SPIRITS OF THE WIND
