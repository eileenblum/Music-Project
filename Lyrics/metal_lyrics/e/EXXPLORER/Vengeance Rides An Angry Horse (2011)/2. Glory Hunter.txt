THE OLD MAN TELLS A STORY, HIS EYES SO FAR AWAY
HOW MANY WERE LOST WITH STEEL IN THEIR HEARTS, INTO THE SEAS OF RAGE - GENERATIONS PAST, THE YEARS GO BY
FOR EACH ONE BORN, ANOTHER WILL DIE
AND THROUGH THE FIGHT, A FEW PREVAIL
TO RIDE THE SHIP WITH SILVER SAILS

IâM ON MY WAY BUT IM NOT SURE WHICH WAY THE ROAD WILL TURN
NEVER LOOK BACK ON THE BRIDGES THAT BURN
GLORY HUNTER, GUNS OF GLORY, GLORY HUNTER

THEREâLL BE NO PATH TO FOLLOW, FOR NO ONE LEAVES A TRAIL
AND IF YOU WALK IN SOMEONES FOOTSTEPS, YOU WILL SURELY FAIL
OUR FATHER PAVED THE WAY FOR US, SO WE COULD HAVE A CHANCE
AND THROUGH THE YEARS, A FEW PREVAIL
TO RIDE THE SHIP WITH SILVER SAILS

IâM ON MY WAY BUT I DONâT KNOW WHICH WAY THE ROAD WILL TURN
NEVER LOOK BACK ON THE BRIDGES THAT BURN
GLORY HUNTER, GUNS OF GLORY, GLORY HUNTER, SONS OF GLORY
NEVER LOOK BACK ON THE BRIDGES THAT BURN
GLORY HUNTER, GUNS OF GLORY, GLORY HUNTER

OUR FATHERS FOUGHT FOR GLORY, WITH BLOOD THEY TELL THEIR STORY
WE LIVED THE TASTE OF FREEDOM, TO THEM WE PLEDGE ALLEGIENCE
BUT WAR IS NEVER ENDING, THERE IS NO COMPREHENDING
THERE IS NO COMPROMISE, ITâS RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES, TO SEE

GLORY HUNTER, GUNS OF GLORY, GLORY HUNTER
GLORY HUNTER, GLORY, GLORY, HUNTER
