IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT SHE BECONS ME
MANIPULATES MY MIND AT WILL, SHE EMPTIES MY HEART
SO COLD, SO COLD, FEEL THE CHILL
MT HEART IS OVERWHELMED WITH DESIRE
MY TWISTED MINDâS ON FIRE

HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY,THE CRY OF THE GYPSY

BLINDED BY PASSION, MY HEART IT SKIPS A BEAT
HER HEARTLESS WEB ENTANGLES ME, IT MAKES ME WEAK
WITH WRECKLESS ABANDON, SPINS HER WEB, SHE MAKES ME SCREAM
SHE TAKES MY SOUL, SHE RIPS MY SOUL, SHE OWNS MY SOUL

HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY,THE CRY OF THE GYPSY

SOMETIMES SHE PREYS ON ME, WHATCH OUT SHEâLL DRAG YOU UNDER
YEAH, SOMETIMES SHE PREYS ON ME, LOOK OUT SHEâLL LOVE ANOTHER
SOMETIMES SHE PREYS, SOMETIMES SHE PREYS
SOMETIMES SHE PREYS ON ME, OH YEAH
SOMETIMES SHE PREYS ON ME, LOOK OUT SHEâLL DRAG YOU UNDER

HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY, THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
HEAR THE CRY, HEAR THE CRY,THE CRY OF THE GYPSY
