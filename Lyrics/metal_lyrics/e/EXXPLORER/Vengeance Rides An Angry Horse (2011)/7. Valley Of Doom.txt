WITH TIME AS OUR FOE, WE RACE TO OUR FATE
BUT LOSING OUR WAY, INTO THE UNKNOWN
THE FURTHER WE SAIL, THE FURTHER WE DRIFT AWAY
AND INTO OUR FACE, THE WIND SEEMED TO BLOW

WE HAD TO GO WEST, TO THE RIVER THAT MEETS THE SEA
BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED, THE RIVER WAS DRY
WE TRAVELLED BY LAND, THROUGH DESERTS WHERE HELL AWAITS
WITH MOUNTAINS SO HIGH, AND VALLEYS SO LOW

INTO THE VALLEY OF DOOM, WHERE DANGER WILL LOOM
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH, HELL WAITS FOR US YET

THE DESERTS BURN, OUR WATERS RAN LOW
AS OUR MEN GROW WEAK, ONWARD WE GO
OUR ENEMY AWAITS, FOR AN ARMY THATâS LOSING FAITH
A MIRACLE NOW, WE SURELY WILL NEED

INTO THE VALLEY OF DOOM, WHERE DANGER WILL LOOM
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH, HELL WAITS FOR US YET

WE LOOKED, TO THE HILLS, THE MOON DISAPPEARED
THE SKY TURNED BLACK, AND THE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING APPEARED
AND THUNDER LIKE BATTLE DRUMS, ECHOE IN THE NIGHT
WE KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE, WE WOULD PREVAIL
AND WHEN WE ATTACKED, THEY KNEW THEIR DEFEAT
WE DRANK FROM OUR CUPS, WITH BLOOD ON OUR HANDS

AND THUNDER LIKE BATTLE DRUMS, ECHOED IN THE NIGHT
WE KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE, WE WOULD PREVAIL
AND WHEN WE ATTACKED, THEY KNEW THEIR DEFEAT
WE DRANK FROM OUR CUPS, TO VICTORY

INTO THE VALLEY OF DOOM, WHERE DANGER WILL LOOM
INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH, HELL WAITS FOR US YET
