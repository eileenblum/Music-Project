[European Bonus Track]HARD TIMES IN THE CITY, PEOPLE LOSING THEIR PRIDE
SOME TAKE DESPERATE MEASURES, SOME CHOSE SUICIDE
SHARP SHOOTIN FOR PLEASURE, DRAWIN LINES IN THE SAND
SOME WALKIN THE DARKSIDE, PUTTING FAITH IN THEIR HANDS

SOON WEâLL BE LEAVIN, COME ALONG IF YOU DARE
CâMON IN, SIT RIGHT DOWN, CAUSE ITâS A LONG WAY
TO THE FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL - FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL

HEAR THE ENGINES ROLLIN, COMIN DOWN THE BEND
SO MANY ARE WAITING, THE WAITING NEVER ENDS
SEE THE STEAM RISIN, WEâRE ALL SHOVELIN COAL
RIDIN INTO THE HEATWAVE, GONNA SAVE YOUR SOUL

YOU WONâT BE LONLEY, ALL YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE THERE
CâMON DOWN, TO HELL TOWN, CAUSE THEREâS A LONG RIDE

TO THE FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL - FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL
HELL, HELL, HELL - FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL, FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL
CâMON - TAKE ME AWAY

HARD TIMES IN THE CITY, PEOPLE LOSING THEIR MINDS
SOME STUCK IN THE SLAVE GRIND, SOME JUST DOIN TIME
HEAR THE ENGINES ROLLIN, WEâRE COMIN ROUND THE BEND
SO MANY ARE WAITING, IT WILL NEVER END

SOON WEâLL BE LEAVIN, COME ALONG IF YOU DARE
CâMON IN, SIT RIGHT DOWN, CAUSE ITâS A LONG WAY
TO THE FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL - FREIGHT TRAIN TO HELL
