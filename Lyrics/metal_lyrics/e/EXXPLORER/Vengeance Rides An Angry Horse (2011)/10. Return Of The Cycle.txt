[European Bonus Track]IN THE DAY OF THE GOLDEN THRONE, CITIES MADE OF SILVER, 
WALLS OF STONE
MIGHTY CASTLES THAT REACH THE SKY, SOON WILL CRUMBLE, FALLIN DOWN
LUST LEADS THEM OUT OF THEIR MINDS
THE RIVERS THEY FLOW, INTO THE OCEANS
THE OCEANS THEY BREAK, INTO THE SEA

WHERE WERE YOU WHEN IT ALL WENT DOWN, IN THE CITY TONIGHT
DID YOU DO WHAT YA WANTED TO DO, DI YA DO WHATâS RIGHT

LUST LEADS THEM OUT OF THEIR MIND
RETURN OF THE CYCLE
RETURN OF THE CYCLE
RETURN OF THE CYCLE

IS IT TOO LATE TO TURN THINGS AROUND
THE CYCLE IS ALMOST COMPLETE, STOP THE WORLD FROM SPINNING ROUND
IS THERE A CHANCE, FOR US TO AWAKE
IS IT A HOPELESS CASE, OR IS IT TOO LATE

RETURN OF THE CYCLE, RETURN
RETURN OF THE CYCLE
RETURN OF THE CYCLE
RETURN OF THE CYCLE, RETURN, RETURN

THE CYCLE HAS BEGUN
