BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS, IâLL BE GONE
DONâT WANNA HURT YOU ANYMORE
DONâT WANNA STEAL YOUR HEART AND SOUL
THEREâS A VOICE THATâS TELLING ME TO GO
TO A PLACE WHERE I BELONG, IT DOESNâT MATTER ANYMORE

CHASING THE HIGH
CHASING THE HIGH
CHASING THE HIGH
CHASING THE HIGH

BY THE TIME I REACH THE COUNTY LINE
LOOKIN THROUGH THE REAR VIEW OF MY MIND
MEMORIES SEEM TO FADE TO BLACK AND WHITE
AND KEEP DISAPPEARING FROM MY SITE
ON THIS HIGHWAY SO ALONE, DRIFTING FURTHER FROM MY HOME

CHASING THE HIGH
CHASING THE HIGH
CHASING THE HIGH
CHASING THE HIGH

MISSED A FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND, THOUGHT OF FLOWERS NEVER SENT
THINGS LIKE THESE THEY COST ALOT
THINK OF BETTER WAYS TO SPEND
PEOPLE NOTICE BLOODSHOT EYES, NO TOMORROWS NO GOODBYES
THINGS ARE STARTING TO REVEAL, THE PART OF ME THAT CANâT BE HEALED

LORD HAVE MERCY, LORD HAVE MERCY
I CANâT FUCKIN BELIEVE THIS, YOU NEED WHAT
MY LICENSE, INSURANCE AND MY REGISTRATION
YOU GOTTA BE OUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKIN MIND
