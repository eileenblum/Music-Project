Sometimes I feel the pain I've known
As the world becomes my final show
I'm sittin' here questioning my life of crime
I await as my heartbeat races faster
The suspense is killing me

Now the guards begin stalking through my hall
They'll soon be unlatching my chain and ball
Drag me to sentence, from my lonely hold
And I'm so scared to find my guilty soul

[Chorus:]
Wait Please!! Cantcha wait a little longer for me
Please wait!! Stop and throw away the key

I've been committed, execution tonight
When the sun has fled, electric my only lite
"Guilty as charged", a horrifying scene
Now sparks ignite, electrifying streaks
I foresee a gathering, of death to be named
As my blood turns ice, I'm freezing in my vein

I near the night, fear the fright, hear the chimes
That ends my life before it's time
My future destined to end in waste
There's no one hear to wipe the blood from my face

[Chorus]
[Monologue]

Take me away
