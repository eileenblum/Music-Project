I often gaze upon the stars
Wonderin' what's beyond the bars
There's someplace that we'll never see
It's beyond our highest peak -

It began with space, our human race
We've turned our world into a waste
People dying and children crying
It's a fate that's soon to be

This is the story of World War III
A harder war there will never be
People dying and children crying
It's a fate that's soon to bey, yeah!!

Now I've seen beyond the stars
I've seen beyond the bars
There's someplace that we'll never see
It's beyond our highest peak
