Masses forming in limited space
Pigs -n- trash meeting face to face
Little gurls on their corners meet
To sell very cheap on the city streets
Wild animals watchin'
File down their teeth as they wait
for the night
Danger is near, don't you trust me!!
The warlords are here
So get ready to fight

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to run; nowhere to hide
why do you stay
People live -n- die on city streets

Cities full of love -n- hate
Danger lurks high and low
Drunks in the alley just masturbate
While blood in the streets still flow
Wild scavengers watching
Just waiting to get to your face
Like dogs starving for flesh
Destroying all of the human race

[Chorus]

They're dying, oh, they're dying, they're dying
