As I lay here in my grave
I feel strange but not alive

Don't hear no sounds
Only slashes of the knives

I'm going to hell tomorrow
So why care today
No reason to cry, in the future I'll pay
We'll meet in the Devil's home
Sooner than I know
I'm going to hell tomorrow
It's my time to go

I feel myself going down and down
My souls' in hell, my body's underground

[Chorus:]
I'm going to hell
I'm going to hell
I'm going to hell
Tomorrow

[Repeat chorus]

Now Satan wants to know
As he calls upon your soul
In the Devil's fire
Yes the fire he controls
I know it's hell, there's so much confusion
I'm in hell, or is it an illusion

I know it's hell because of the fire
I cannot stop this burning desire to live

[Chorus]

Then Satan does devour
The minds who die
He says come on down; don't be shy
I'm here in hell - come and join me
He is the Devil, with your life he holds the key

Come on down and you will be my slave
I will take you from your eternal grave

[Chorus]
