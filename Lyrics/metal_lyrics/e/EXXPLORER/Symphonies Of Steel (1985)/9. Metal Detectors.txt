I sleep by the day, I live for the night
Don't get in my way, I'm programmed to strike
I'm hungry for metal, I'm searchin' for steel
My power is lethal, and I do as I feel

The power of metal, is driving you near
No one can stop you, intentions are clear
Our minds are magnets, our masses have formed
Our numbers are growing, like a metal storm

Radiant troops in front of bright lites
Tortured by sounds, distorted by night

Look all around us, we're never alone
The Metal Detectors are losing control

Lose it!!!

Don't let them tell you that metal is dead
They listen to Springsteen, it's gone to their head
So look all around us, we're never alone
Yes the Metal Detectors are taking control
