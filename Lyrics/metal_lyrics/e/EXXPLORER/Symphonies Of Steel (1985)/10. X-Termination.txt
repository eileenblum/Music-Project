Just before the sun comes up
There's a stillness in the air
Silence is all around us
And there's no room for despair
But when the sun begins to rise
The evil takes control
They educate the world with lies
X-terminating souls!

Just before the sun goes down
They gather into prayer
Some recite together,
But the others sit and stare
Their hollow minds have no control
Their eyes too blind to see
X-terminate some other soul
No desire to be free

Just before the break of dawn
I'll be standing all alone
Looking for a place that's warm
But there's no place to call home
Running from desolation
I will never forget
X-terminate some other soul
'Cause mine you'll never --- GET!!
