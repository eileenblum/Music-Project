We were hungry in the worst of times
Yet they knew what they could do
Content with excellence, but they knew to take to heart
Running low and getting lost

You've got to cry before you can speak
I long for this train to crash
Is it time to pull it apart
How long will this vision last

Beg, borrow and steel
How much pain is there to feel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel

We were strong, we follow this code
But not for long, our music is gold
We're in over our knees, we beg through the night
Won't slave to command, won't give up the fight

You've got to cry before you can speak
I long for this train to crash
Is it time to pull it apart
How long will this vision last

Beg, borrow and steel
How much pain is there to feel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel

We were hungry in the worst of time
Yet they knew what they could do
Content with excellence, but they knew to take to heart
Running low and getting lost

You've got to cry before you can speak
How long for this train to crash
Is it time to pull it apart
How long will the vision last

Beg, borrow and steel
How much pain is there to feel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
Beg, borrow and steel
On your knees
On your knees
On your knees
Beg, borrow and steel
