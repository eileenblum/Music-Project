Days on the road
They disappear
Got sixteen tons of gold
Take your turn
Watch the candle burn
But they are all aglow

From a whisper to a scream
We are the living proof
From the cradle to the stage
Among the wasted youth

I, I looked at you
You looked at me
We shook the house
Now we'll break it down
I, I got what you need
Ecstasy
We rocked the town
Now we're rocking bound

We'll be there almost everyday
Eighteen wheels a-rolling
Take your turn
Watch the candle burn
Our age is rock 'n' rolling

From a whisper to a scream
We are the living proof
From the cradle to the stage
Among the wasted youth

I, I looked at you
You looked at me
We shook the house
Now we'll break it down
I, I got what you need
Ecstasy
We rocked the town
Now we're rocking bound

I, I looked at you
You looked at me
We shook the house
Now we'll break it down
I, I got what you need
Ecstasy
We rocked the town
Now we're rocking bound
