When I open my eyes, I see darkness
My body doesn't move, it seems lifeless
I think I had my last day on Earth
Think of life, what was is worth
Was it worth the suffering pain

Was it worth the suffering pain
And if I had the chance I'd do it all again
Would you be there, could you be there
When I'm smelling the roses, would you be there
When I'm smelling the roses, would you be there
