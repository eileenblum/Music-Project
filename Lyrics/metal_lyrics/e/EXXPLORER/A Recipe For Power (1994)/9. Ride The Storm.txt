Once in a later time, we cruised the sea
Across the oceans we would glide
The search of answers for a better life
A crew and ship side by side

Adjoining in search of pleasure
Many battles for the bold
Sending the ships into trouble
A promise to battles you have won
The lightning crumbles from the sky
Taking count, many die
The lightning crumbles

Ride the storm
Ride the storm
Ride the storm

We were wasted back in battle
It seems that it would end
Boast a cry from the sky
The sound whispers I

So the word tells a story
Of a voyage in our time
The storm sent its curse
We were frozen to the seas
