Rock the nation
Can you hear me sing it
One more time

In a place long ago
On a land where we fight to be free
The voices of music was scarce to the minds
Something new, it was yet to be heard
Distant voices across the waters
 brought the gift from far away lands
To soothe their minds, to soothe their souls
The people danced and danced

Can you hear me sing
Rock the nation
Can you hear me saying
One more time
Can you hear me say it
Can you hear me say
One more time tonight

Time prospered and people grew
Compositions multiplied
The sound waves across the land
From city to the mountainside
All the visions of the masters
Sent the sound through the air
And through it all rock emerged
And now rock lives everywhere

Can you hear me sing
Rock the nation
Can you hear me saying
One more time
Can you hear me say it
Can you hear me say
One more time tonight

All the people of the nation
Gather round and hear the song
Hear the sound, the pulse is racing
There's something for everyone
All around the people we know
We can do what we want to do
Anyplace you want to go
We know we have the right to be free

Can you hear me sing
Rock the nation
Can you hear me saying
One more time
Can you hear me say it
Can you hear me say it
One more time tonight
