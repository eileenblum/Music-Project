Look to the sun
For you know it's the only one
The only one you can count on
Day and night, to light the moon
Isn't it funny
Though it's great it can't be bought
They can't be had for any price you pay
The ones you see shall afford today

Bless the sky that's above you
And the ground at your feet
Find it hard just to listen
Pray to God it will take

With unfortunate eyes, you have seen
The one whom have committed the sin
You are only to blame, only to blame

Bible black, they just crumble
Burning fast as to flame, you're ready as you stumble
You shall kick deep in your shame

With unfortunate eyes, you have seen
The one whom committed the sin
You are only to blame, only to blame

Look, look at yourself
Clenching your hands, trying to run
Open your eyes, hoping to hide
The deeper you run, the damage is done

Excellence you have jumbled
Falling deep you wake
Frightened, had you stumble
Bible black at your feet

With unfortunate eyes, you have been
The one whom committed the sin
You are only to blame, only to blame

Look, look at yourself
Clenching your hands, trying to run
Open your eyes, hoping to hide
The deeper you run, the damage is done

I can't take this much more
Shame and guilt rule my soul
If I die, I'll be released from this pain
I regret all my sins, I regret what I've done
The meaning of my life flashes by

Look, look at yourself
Clenching your hands, trying to run
Open your eyes, hoping to hide
The deeper you run, the damage is done
