The crossroads of my mind
Take me across the fields to a place in time
Where all I see is real
Pitched a path to go
And take it to the end or to you know
That fate can hide its face from you and me
From you and me

Memories trapped inside that bring us here
To the point in time
Are ours for eternity
As the years fall in line
Hold them close and you'll feel fine
Content as you can be
As you can be
As you can be

Wide is the gate
Broad is the way
That leads to self destruction
Turn, for it's late
Trapped you will stay
Caught in life's seduction

The time is spent, now left behind
You chose one and I chose mine
Deflect our memories
For you and me
For you and me

Wide is the gate
Broad is the way
That leads to self destruction
Turn, for it's late
Trapped you will stay
Caught in life's seduction

Wide is the gate
Broad is the way
That leads on to self destruction
Turn, for it's late
Trapped you will stay
Caught in life's seduction
