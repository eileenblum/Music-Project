[Lyrics: Giancarlo]

Through the shadows I see what it could be
Beyond beliefes and common places, I see the power of life
Nothing here belongs to me
And I don't belong to this place

What was once... is nevermore
What was once... is nevermore

And yet you say everything's ok
And yet you tell me not to be afraid
What do you want from me?
What I see is no longer familiar to me

What sorrounds me is assuming monstrous forms
What I have been and what I am
What does that matter now?
As I load my gun with my broken dreams

[Solo: Nicola]

And proudly pass the threshold
Of the nameless abyss
Every step is definitive, indelible
Here every thought is imprinted in the dark
Every feeling is a column of stone
My rage is a cold fire which doesn't light
My love a particle of dust
In the huge emptiness of the abyss
My life the smallest gear of an unknown machine

What was once... is nevermore

[Solo: Mario]
