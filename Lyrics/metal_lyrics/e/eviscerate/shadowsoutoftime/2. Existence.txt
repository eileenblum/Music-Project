[Lyrics: Nicola]

Distension, lack of space
Skin obstructs my arms, my eyes
Useless stumps, discomfort

I'll be born, among the waste my mother
Will give me birth, to leave me
Rotten stink, the only memory

I've been born, and rape my own vanity
Hiding behind non-existent thoughts and happiness,
Sad prizes for a crawling time-serving
Play with my tongue, string it through rotten teeths,
Tear it, pushin' it in my throat
Lungs implode
Infected cancer in a child snow-white body
Play with my tongue, string it through rotten teeths

I'll be grown in a grey ridoled building,
Witness of a war lost in the past,
Solitude the only memory

[Solo: Nicola]

Now I'm dead, only certainty
And happily sing, like nothing had never happened.

Distension, lack of space
Skin obstructs my arms, my eyes
Useless stumps, discomfort
I'll be born, among the waste my mother
Will give me birth, to leave me
Rotten stink, the only memory
I've been born, and rape my own vanity
