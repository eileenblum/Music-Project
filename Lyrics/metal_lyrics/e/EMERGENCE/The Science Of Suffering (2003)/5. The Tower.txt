Loveless, soul-less robots made out of skin
Manicure, accessorize, cover up the sewage within
Twisted, tainted, always at odds
Silicone idols to disposable gods
You turn every good thing into a sin

Build your tower out of stone, live within until it falls
Then crouched in darkness all alone
Come tumbling down like plastic dolls
Hide the signs of suffering, embrace your mediocrity
Like mindless zombies shuffling
You imitate reality

Haunted, sleepless meat-puppet without a will
Sanguine, yet your peace of mind comes in a pill
Torpid, tranquil, hopeful and vain
Undersexed, overfed and living in pain
The less you know of yourself the more you can kill

Build your tower out of twigs, live within until it falls
Then like those silly play-time pigs
Come tumbling down like plastic dolls
Hide the signs of suffering, embrace your mediocrity
Like mindless zombies shuffling you imitate reality
Build your tower out of stone, live within until it falls
Then crouched in darkness all alone
Come tumbling down like plastic dolls
Hide the signs of suffering, embrace your mediocrity
Like mindless zombies shuffling
You imitate reality
