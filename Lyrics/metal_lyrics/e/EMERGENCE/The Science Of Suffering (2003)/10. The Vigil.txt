The house is growing quiet, the vigil will begin
A nightly visitation will surely come again
And you must keep your silence, the walls are paper-thin
Oh yes, you must be silent, the walls are paper-thin
A light's on in the hallway, there's footsteps at the door
Your kind and cruel tormentor casts his shadow on the floor
And still you must be silent, for no-one will believe
Oh yes, you must be silent, good children don't deceive.

A heaving weight, stifling your cries
Penetrating pain, wetness on your thighs
And then he'll tell you: "My dear I truly love you."
He flinches when you ask him
why do you do the things you do,,,
you think he's on the level
When he says it is the Devil
Or perhaps it is the grain, (he will explain)
That makes him cause your pain

The house is growing quiet, the vigil will begin
In grim anticipation, of a parental sin
And still you must be silent, the walls are paper-thin
Oh yes, you must be silent, the walls are paper-thin
The footsteps in the hallway, they fill your heart with fear
Your nemesis is coming, you feel him drawing near
And still you keep you promise, a solemn spoken vow
A pact that you would sunder, if only you knew how

A heaving weight, stifling your cries
Penetrating pain, wetness on your thighs
And then he'll tell you: "My dear I truly love you."
He flinches when you ask him
why do you do the things you do,,,
you think he's on the level
When he says it is the Devil
Or perhaps it is the grain, (he will explain)
That makes him cause your pain
(Repeat)
