I can see you now
You're looking far away
I wonder if you're dreaming of
A happy future day
Your body poised and still
Your face composed serene
The moving forms around you
Seem like actors in a scene

Now you lie alone at night
Won't you call my name
I can tell you don't feel right
Won't you call my name
When you break down and weep
Do you call my name
Just before you go to sleep
Do you call my name

I reach to touch your face
Your skin is smooth and cool
You forbear with dignity
While I feel like a fool
You look into my eyes
I see your thoughts collide
The only indication of
What's going on inside

Now you lie alone at night
Won't you call my name
I can tell you don't feel right
Won't you call my name
When you break down and weep
Do you call my name
Just before you go to sleep
Do you call my name

A disconcerting feeling
Has struck me once again
A hollow sort of sickness
That consumes me from within
I search your face for feeling
The slightest little sign
A crack in the facade that shows
That underneath, you're mine
[Repeat refrain]
