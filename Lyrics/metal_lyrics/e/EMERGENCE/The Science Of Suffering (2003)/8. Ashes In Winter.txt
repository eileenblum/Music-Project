Somewhere an infant cries / her parents do not stir
 resting under leaden skies / I wonder who they were
The stolid minions come / They do as they were told
The streets are growing still / The flesh is growing cold
Another wretched day / Followed by sleepless night
I don't care what you say / You knew it wasn't right

Now all I know is winter
Without the scent of spring
Today is filled with sorrow
What will tomorrow bring
Do you remember winter
When ashes fell like snow
Now all I know is winter
Where did the summer go

The angry ones return / Like children sick with fear
So young but they will learn / The end is drawing near
The annex seems to shrink / The days blur into one
The sweat-soaked linens stink / I long to see the sun
Another wretched day / Followed by sleepless night
I don't care what you say / You knew it wasn't right
