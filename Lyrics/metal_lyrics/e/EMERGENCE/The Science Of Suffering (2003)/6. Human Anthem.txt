Pacing in a gilded cage
Youthful lust turns to rage
You turn your fear into a need
Scratch your sores until they bleed
Take solace in a stranger's bed
You find no love but pain instead
Within your mind an awful din
The world grows smaller as the walls start closing in

Stigmatic mentors love to grind
Shards of hate into your mind
As distances grow longer
You leave familiar dreams behind
So trenchant in your slow decay
Deteriorating everyday
The whispers in your head insist
There's got to be another way

Enamored of a golden cross
Immerse yourself to conceal your loss
An edifice with marble walls
You'll find no peace within its halls
Weeping icons with stony eyes
In mute reprisal bear your lies
A swelling void consumes your soul
With each concession you dig yourself a deeper hole

Stigmatic mentors love to grind
Shards of hate into your mind
As distances grow longer
You leave familiar dreams behind
So trenchant in your slow decay
Deteriorating everyday
The whispers in your head insist
There's got to be another way
[Repeat]
