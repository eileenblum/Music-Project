Your stolen innocence lost beyond recovery
A cold ambivalence desecrates that memory
A warped reality an expectation spurned
Lost in banality
And paradise burned

Scars cross your tender flesh
Your world is torn apart
A black malaise
no words of praise
can sooth your aching heart
Lost an weary stained and dreary
Still your life goes on
Cold and Jaded joys have faded
Soon they will be gone

Clinging to sanity the walls are closing in
Trapped in venality the cycle starts again
Seeking security an expectation spurned
I mourned your purity
And paradise burned

Scars cross your tender flesh
Your world is torn apart
A black malaise
no words of praise
can sooth your aching heart
Lost an weary stained and dreary
Still your life goes on
Cold and Jaded joys have faded
Soon they will be gone
