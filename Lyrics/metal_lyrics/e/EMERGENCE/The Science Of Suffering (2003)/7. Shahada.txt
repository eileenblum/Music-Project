Kneel on sacred reeds and kiss the rising sun
A wild intemperate wind will rush
Among the works that you've begun
Set the skies aflame and dance within the fire
A sword, a word, a holy verse
The keys to all that you desire

Scorn to take the tainted cup
Life and light will wash away
Bear your tender spirit up
Hope and faith will wash away
Bury reason in the sand
Love and trust will wash away
Hide your face as they command
Heart and soul will wash away

Dine on brittle straws and bind your wounds with prayer
The promises of ancient prophets vanish in the desert air
Sow your fields with flesh put poison in your well
Entomb yourself while still alive condemn yourself to living hell

Scorn to take the tainted cup
Life and light will wash away
Bear your tender spirit up
Hope and faith will wash away
Bury reason in the sand
Love and trust will wash away
Hide your face as they command
Heart and soul will wash away
