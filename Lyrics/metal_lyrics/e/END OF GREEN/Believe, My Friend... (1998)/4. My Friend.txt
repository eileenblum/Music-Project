You have to be on your last day...
You never know what you have done to me...
But every night....lights go out and you feel alright...
You take what you will taken...you do what you will do...

Can you tell me...WHY....
Did you kill yourself....
Can you tell me why....

We are young and your hope is lost....we are young and we still be
friends...so can you tell is this the end my friend?

My friend is dead....and i love my friend...
But every night lights go out and you feel alright...

Can you tell me why....
Did you kill yourself.....
