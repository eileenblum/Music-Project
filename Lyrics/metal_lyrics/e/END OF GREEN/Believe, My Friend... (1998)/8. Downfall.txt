Fallen down, will now I die?
I'm bothering to eternal skies ... full of memories
I remember all the time in which my exceptions for a better life seeming die tonight
It's my last wish then I will forever be
It's my last love then I can be forever free
The way I walk is cold and deep I cannot lying come put your hands out in the sky
Show me how you love listen to me god help me please and make me free

Then I'm falling down falling down falling down falling down deep in my mind
Then I'm falling down falling down falling down falling down into my mind
It's my last breathe then I will forever be
It's my last love then I can be forever free
The way I walk is cold and deep I cannot lying come put your hands out in the sky
Show me how you love listen to me god help me please and make me free

Falling down, falling down ...
