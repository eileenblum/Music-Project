I have a dream so deep and so real
I have a dream of you and of me
I have sined and i have failed
many tears of crying
Many ways of dying
I have to believe in...

All that she said
believe in your way
everyday i dream of you 

everyday i believe in you

Have you ever asked me what i feel...

Have you ever asked what i am.....
