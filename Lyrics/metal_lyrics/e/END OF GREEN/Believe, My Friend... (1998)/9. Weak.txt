You have to swallow your sorrow please don't ask me what is god and what will you always be
You're like a little child a little child a child like a little child - you don't understand ...

I'm sad when I see myself I'm sad when I don't understand
I'm sad when I see myself I'm sad when I don't understand

You saw the things I hate
It's all the things I've seen and I don't understand
what you tell me what I have to do and that (dead?) what I will be
I have to be myself and not that kind what you always tell
It's boring and it makes me sad

Oh come on haven't you heard that crying?
You motherfucker lied
I don't mind I don't mind I don't mind this life
But I'll never step back in my life
I don't mind I don't mind I don't mind this life
I don't need I don't need you!

Here I don't need I don't need I don't need don't need you! It's time to understand ...
