Can you believe in ...the time we had....
did you ever know what I have felt..
we talk about us but I don't care, I climb inside me..
I'm forever free...
I don't know where I go ...I go away
Have you ever believed in my own words...
you forever dying, inside my mind..
you have to leave me...be forever dead
I don't know where I go I go away

I go away.......
