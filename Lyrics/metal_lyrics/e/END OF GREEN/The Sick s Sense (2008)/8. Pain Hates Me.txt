I walk the line 'till the end of the road.
I never went that far...
I wanna drown myself in your eyeball.
The midnight-pain is on the way.
It seems like this will be the day.
I don't care and I don't think about it...

But hey, you faint me,
you taint me,
like every single day.
You hate me, you fake it.
I wish you'd go away...

Pain rapes me,
pain hates me, like every single day.
It's okay, it's okay.
I cut out shapes of murdered dreams and pin them on your chest.
Painting by numbers, little baby.
You are my favourite number one in a line of things not to become.

I don't care and I don't think about it.
