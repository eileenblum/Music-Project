You are the one, you hate everything.
Like me.
No one could know that it gets too far, against anything.
Our love, our trust and anything.
Our hate, our faith - just everything.

'Cause everything is dead.
Everything is said.
'Cause everything is dead.
We'll never meet again.

You are the one, you hate everything.
Like me.
And no one could know, that it goes too far, against anything.
Our love, our trust and anything.
Our hate, our faith - just everything.

'Cause everything is dead.
Everything is said.
'Cause everything is dead.
We'll never meet again.

Tonight we end up everything, just like we'd never meet again.
We need to sleep, we need to rest.
It seems like it will be the best.
We need to bleed, the world will sleep.
We stop in our one last breath.
No need to sleep, no need to rest, it seems like it will be the best.

All the hate seems far away, we're burning our lives.
I'd like to see you once again - but hey, we'll never meet again.
We're dead!
We're dead!
We're dead!
We'll never meet again.
We're dead!
We're dead!
We're dead!
We'll never meet again.
We're dead!
We're dead! (dead)
We're dead!
We'll never meet again. (dead)
