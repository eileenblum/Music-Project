Killing honesty, keep on selling lies.
On another day you will blow my mind.
You break me.
When this feeling hurts like a burning flame.
Just like everytime, like a hurricane.
You save me.

I, I have a cry on your shoulder.
You're pretending.
You, you make me feel so much colder.
Never ending.

You, you keep me silent forever
I deny you.
I, I thought that we get together.
I surrender.

Killing honesty, keep on selling lies.
On another day you will blow my mind.
You break me.
When this feeling hurts like a burning flame.
Just like everytime, like a hurricane.
You rave me.

You, you have a cry on my shoulder.
I'm pretending.
I, I keep you silent forever.
Now it's ending.

You, you thought that we get together -
we get never together.

So keep on selling lies and go away.
You can't drag me down, you stupid thing.

Killing honesty, keep on selling lies.
On another day you will blow my mind.
You break me.
When this feeling hurts like a burning flame.
Just like everytime, like a hurricane.
You save me.

As you dare, as you stare, it's a shame if no one cares.
Go too far, see my scars and the bleeding of my heart.
As you kill, as you try, feels like everyone will cry.
Go too far, see my scars and the bleeding of my heart.
