The sickness crown, I make you feel.
I'm gonna cut you down.
Come take my life and all from me-
still gonna cut you down.
It's all inside of me, I never feel.

I feel, it heals, I feel.

The crown of thorn must be a thrill-
I'm gonna wear it proud.
Come take my pride and all from me.
Still gonna burn it down.

I think for real, this dream is over and again-
I fear to bleed, you rule me over and again-
I care 'bout things, it's coming over and again-
I think for real, this dream is over and again-
I care, you bleed - it's coming over and again-
I'm there, you leave - it's starting over and again.

I feel you there, you never show me the next thing.
I see you there, the dream is over and again-
I let you drown, I let you feel.
You cut me down, I never feel.
