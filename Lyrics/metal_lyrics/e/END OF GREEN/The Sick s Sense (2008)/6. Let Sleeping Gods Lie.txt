The doors that you opened wide for a world that died long ago.
The rooms, they're closed, and your open eyes are blind.
As the moon and stars collide,
wake the sleeping Gods, they failed-
in this night as something died.
I wish I had never lived.
Never hurt someone like this-
cut my life and take me down...

The truth that you force on me...
Let the world go down for me.
My eyes are closed, and your open eyes are blind.
As the moon and stars collide,
wake the sleeping Gods, they failed-
in this night as something died.
I wish I had never lived.
Never hurt someone like this-
cut my life and take me down...
