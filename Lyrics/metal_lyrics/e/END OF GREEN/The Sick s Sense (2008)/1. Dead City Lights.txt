Down with the city lights.
Burning hearts with grief.
So many times I crawled on this way.
There's a pain in sight.
Everyone's insane.
Same old town and nothing remains.
Damn the city lights.
Burning all you freaks so many times I walked on this way.
You're all insane.
You can never hide the pain tonight.
Fellows on my side, together we will feed on their blood.
Fuck this place up.
Damn those city lights.
All the hearts we break, all the moments we fake, the deadline will be our enemy.
Now the mourning awakes, all the souls that we take the daylight will be our enemy
