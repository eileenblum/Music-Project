See my world is down now-
a little piece of lies.
Empty rooms and sad eyes-
I'd be not surprised.
So come, see what you have done, not scared of all.
Please come, heading for a secret, let me fall.
Send me a little smile.
My crying veins.
My body's still dead, but I'll be coming back.
All the things have faded, let me feel it.
The cure for me is only my decease.
All the things are missing, let me feel it.
The cure for me is only my decease.

All these things I'm leaving, no more feeling-
the cure for me is only my decease.

See, my world is down now.
I'd be not surprised.
See, my world is down now-
I'll be not afraid.
I'll be not afraid.
So come, see what you have done, not scared of all.
Please come, a hello for a secret, let me fall.
Send me a little smile...
My crying veins.
My body is still dead,, but I'll be coming back...
