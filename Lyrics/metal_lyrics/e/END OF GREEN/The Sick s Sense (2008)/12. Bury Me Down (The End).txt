My love decrease.
My heart that weeps.
The years, they used me up,
Left their mark on my skin.
And now I'm old, unfulfilled,
So why should i go?
My youth - a long gone day.
The mood has passed away.
I guess there's nothing left but a waste of different moments in my head.
I cannot feel how strong my love is,
I cannot feel who are you.
I am born for burning, bury me again.
I cannot feel how strong my heart is,
I cannot feel how sickness grows.
I am born for burning, bury me, bury me down.
