The golden years are gone, the world has lost her grace.
Everyone is in rage and seek for better days.
We're living off your broken lives.
Dead before you lived.
We die.
Salvation.

We'll have a good time, when we're dead.
Bad days make us glad.
We need no life to remember.
Worst times, happy sad, wasted like a wreck.
We need no time to remember.

The golden days so far, the world has lost her face.
Everyone is in hurry, the creepers will be saints.
We're living off your broken lives.
Dead before you lived.
We die.
Temptation.

Worst times, happy sad, good times, kill me, dead.
Worst times, happy sad, wasted like a wreck.
Worst times, happy sad, bad days make us glad.
Worst times, happy sad, good times, kill me, dead.

We'll have a good time, when we're dead.
Bad days make us glad.
We need no life to remember.
Worst times, happy sad, wasted like a wreck.
We need no time to remember.

We turn the good times into sad, bad ones into worse.
We need no life to remember.
Worst times, happy sad, wasted like a wreck,
'Cause nothing lasts forever.
