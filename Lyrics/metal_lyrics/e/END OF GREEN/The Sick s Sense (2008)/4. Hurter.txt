You're my favorite thing.
Wondering and think.
Hurt me, if you can.

You're my favorite star.
Wondering how far.
I made a big mistake.

I hurt her, but I didn't know.
I hurt her, 'cause I can't let go.
I hurt her, 'cause she's a killing joke.

I hurt her, but I didn't know.
I hurt her, 'cause it's time to go, to face the cold within.

I will hurt you in the morning,
I will love you in the night.

You're my sweetest thing.
Something strange begins.
Hit me with your thoughts.

You're my favorite star.
I will rape your heart.
Some cruel and ugly things.

I hurt her, but I didn't know.
I hurt her, 'cause I can't let go.
I hurt her, 'cause she's a killing joke.

I hurt her, but I didn't know.
I hurt her, 'cause it's time to go, to face the cold within.

I will hurt you in the morning,
I will love you in the night.

I will hurt you in...
the morning

I will hurt you in the morning
I will love you in the night

Hurt you, hurt you, hurt you

Love you, love you, love you
