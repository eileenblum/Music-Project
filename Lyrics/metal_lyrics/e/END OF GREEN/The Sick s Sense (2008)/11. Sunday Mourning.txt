So many days, so many nights I'll be without you.
So many roads I'll be walking alone without you.
I haven't seen, I haven't seen,
you're so far away from me.
I can't believe, I can't believe that all is ending.
I cannot feel, I cannot feel all the things that you do.
I cannot be, I cannot be the one you need to become true.
I can't believe, I can't believe it's the world I was given.
I can't believe, I can't believe that all is ending.

So many ways, so many roads and no place to feel home.
Too heavy load, God knows I'm not stronger than you.
I should have seen, I should have seen you're so far away from me.
I can't believe, I can't believe that all is ending.
Now and forever leaving these roads.
Never together, never so close.
Dreaming forever, you cover my soul.
Sleepless forever, dead smiles from above...
