I taste the days before i leave, I'm waiting still in grief.
A dissappointed night.
I gaze, i gaze what i have done. The end of things to come.
Not scared what i have done.
I wait, I'm waiting here and bleed, I'm waiting still in grief, abusing all 
the time.
I sink, I'm sinking down tonight, still wait that bitch called life, the end 
begins tonight.
'Cause there's no more feeling, here I am, I am the last one, the last one 
in this night.
I gaze, I gaze my open veins. the morphine makes insane, abuse me all the 
time.
It makes, it makes me feel alive, the drug will keep me smile.
I say the world goodbye, I'm leaving with a smile.
You will see, I'm crawling, use the switch, I'm falling through the other 
side, tragedy insane.
One last pill, I'm crawling, use the switch, I'm falling, I'm falling down.
