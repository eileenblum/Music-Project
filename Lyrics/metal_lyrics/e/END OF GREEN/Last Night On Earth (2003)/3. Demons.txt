It was the night when the darkness came and the
days were getting cold. It was the night when the
angel died and the demon had been crowned.
It was the night when my soul has died and my
Heart was getting cold. It was the night when the
Angel died and the demon had been crowned. Ride
On the same old feeling, something strange and sad.
Ride on, dead wings of sickness, the demon in my
head. a time to go, a time I'm feeling dead.
