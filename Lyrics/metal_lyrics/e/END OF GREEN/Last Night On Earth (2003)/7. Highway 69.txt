I'll be out there all the night, some drugs in my head will make me feel 
alright.
Everynight it's just the same, I get high, I get high, I get high, yeah.
Everynight it's just the same, the drugs in my head are driving me insane, 
but it makes me feel alright.
I get high, I get high, I get high, yeah.
It will be just one last night, the drugs in my head will make me feel 
alright.
It's my one and last goodbye.
On the high... on the highway 69.
