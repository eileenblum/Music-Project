Sad is the moment all the time. Still be surrounded
by pale lights. Sad is the moment when you go.
There has nothing changed when all the days are
gone. but there's one thing now here in this night,
one thing you can't change this life. We are dying
in moments when we're alive. Frozen the moment
all the time. Sadly my soul I can't avoid. Shine
velvet flower on my grave. Dead I will smile my
darkest days.
