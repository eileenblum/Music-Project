Can you hear me cry, my disease, there is so much more
that I should give. In the end, nothing more, it's the end,
but there's so much more that i should give.
Can't stand this pain anymore, my disease, can you see
sad I'm sitting here and waiting still.
The days are over now.
Is there something in my mind, is there anyone outside,
my addiction, give me more.
Is there anyone tonight, is there something in this life,
my addiction, give me more.
Sad and sleepless in this night, cut my veins you
little knife, my addiction, give me more.
Is there anyone tonight, is there anyone outside,
in the end is nothing more.
