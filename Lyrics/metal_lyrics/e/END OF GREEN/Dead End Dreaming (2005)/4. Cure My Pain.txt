Cure my bleeding pain, with razorblade.
It's in my veins, I'm lost in life.
The blood in my veins, feel so sick and tired.
It's in my veins, I'm lost tonight.
Let it end and all those memories.
Born to end - and nothing will remain with all the days gone.
Almost there - and I prepare to leave,
Fall asleep - I lived a life of grief, goddamn, I'm gone.
