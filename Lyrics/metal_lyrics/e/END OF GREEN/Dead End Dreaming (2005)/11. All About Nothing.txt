Time passes by so fast.
My funeral has begun.
No more need to pretend.
All those things will end.
All that we had,
Someday, maybe I'm glad for one day.
All that we had - for nothing, love and hate - for nothing.
Now light seems lost in the night.
Life put out that spark.
No more need to pretend.
All those things will end.
Pictures of you -
For nothing, moments we shared - for nothing,
Tears that we dried - for nothing, all that we said - for nothing,
Now all about all...
And nothing.
