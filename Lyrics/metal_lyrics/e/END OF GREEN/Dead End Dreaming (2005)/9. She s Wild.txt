She paints black pictures, her eyes filled with sorrow than she cries,
The curtain falls.
Raped by her life.
Left alone in these never-ending night.
Her restless times.
Sad in these hours,
These moments, she's walking down the hall.
She begins to smile...
She's going wild, oh she had a knife.
She's going wild, she's not satisfied.
Black dressed appearing, a life without feeling.
No thoughts, no love inside.
Despairing and dreaming, amazed by a bitter taste of joy, her bloody toy.
She cuts again, thens she's leaving with a trial of blood the hall and begins to cry.
All she want is to be loved.
Tonight she goes too far.
She's gone without a trace and now the curtains close again.
She's going so wild.
