No coming home at night
Under dead city lights,
It's all coming down,
Dead sunset is born.
I cannot sleep at night.
Another useless fight, it goes on and on, no new day will come.
Under dead city lights,
Until the dawn will rise.
I'm searching for more
So cruel, my thoughts.
I find no sleep at night,
Another useless fight,
it goes on and on, no new day will come.
Scared about all the things that covered me in life,
I'm on the only way, I leave this world tonight
Scared about all the things that covered me in life,
I'm on the only way, I leave this world tonight

Scared about all the things that covered me in life,
I'm on the only way, I leave this world tonight
And I wasted my ability, I failed, my soul insanity,
I tried all ways - the last one is the way down.
And I'm tired of my useless being, I failed, my soul insanity.
I tried all ways - the last one is the way down (home)
I'm leaving this world tonight.
I'm leaving this world tonight.
