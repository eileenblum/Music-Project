Now here we stand still on the edge
where will we be, we're living like a tragedy
We stand together, we fall together
for our pleasure it doesn't matter anyway

I understand the way you feel
this sorrow hurts
I wanna feel your pain on me

Still hand in hand until the end
and say farewell
let's sing the song of agony

For the sad and the lonely, the useless and the weak
for the sad and the lonely, who lives a tragedy
For the sad and the lonely, the useless and the weak...for the sad, the sad, the sad

I understand the way you feel,
this sorrow hurts
So beautiful you feel the same.
We stand together, we fall together, for our pleasure it doesn't matter anyway

Now here we stand, still on the edge
where will we be, we're living like a tragedy

Still hand in hand until the end
and say farewell
let's sing the song of agony

So come on, come on, let's sing the song, the song of agony.
