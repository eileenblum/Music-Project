Where are you, no view, no sign.
I lied alone in my bed.
Where are you.
Where you tonight.
I lie awake in my bed tonight.
Escape from here.
This is not the fear I fear.
This is your voice and your sweet choice.
Come back now with me.
Come back now with me.
So many voices, I can hear them in the night.
