Every other day,
Waiting for the point called zero,
Every other day, take it back, take it back away from me.
Every other day living like a dead end hero, every other day.
In the end, don't be scared, you're almost there.
It's the end,
One big dance before you smile with the dead,
One last ride before you leave, you're almost there.
No more tears, no more fears and no more lies.
It's the end.
One big smile before you dance with the dead.
Take the ride and join the end and wave goodbye..
Every other day,
Waiting for the point called zero,
Every other day, take it back, take it back away from me.
Every other day living like a dead end hero, every other day.
In the end, don't be scared, you're almost there.
It's the end,
One big dance before you smile with the dead,
One last ride before you leave, you're almost there.
No more tears, no more fears and no more lies.
It's the end.
One big smile before you dance with the dead.
Take the ride and join the end and wave goodbye.
Every other day,
Waiting for the point called zero,
Every other day, take it back, take it back away from me.
Every other day living like a dead end hero, every other day.
You will know, when the last star fades away (at night).
Don't be scared, I'll be waiting on the other side.
Reach for my hand, I'm your last ride home.
Still the end waits, it's over, it's all done.
Every other day,
Waiting for the point called zero,
Every other day, take it back, take it back away from me.
Every other day living like a dead end hero, every other day.
Every other day, (Every other day,)
Living like a dead end hero, every other day.
