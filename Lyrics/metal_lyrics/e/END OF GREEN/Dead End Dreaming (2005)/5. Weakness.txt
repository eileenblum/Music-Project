No more will, nothing more to say.
Another shotgun blow me away.
There is something inside of me,
There is nothing inside of me, no.
Something strange so deep inside.
There is something inside my mind,
There is something inside of me you'll never see.
I don't care about me, let this dead end be.
Through the days we crawl and you will see,
This nightmare turns to misery,
When all the days keep crawling without hope.
No more night without misery.
Another nightmare is killing me.
Like lost souls who bleed.
Nothing else that I can feel, no.
Something screams inside my mind, another weakness, another fight.
There is something inside of me you'll never see.
And this nightmare turns to misery, through all the days we drown in grief.
When all the days keep crawling without hope.
In a time, abused to wait and bleed.
This nightmare turns to misery.
Through all the days we're crawling without hope...
Without hope...
Without hope.
