Pale, sad eyes won't cry.
A face without a smile, the grace, the lies, the fall.
Amused to loose it all.
Sad about all the things you'll never see.
So sad about all, everything.
You and me.
So sad about all.
That feeling never dies.
Sad about all the ways I wanna be.
So sad about all, everything.
You and me.
So sad about all.
That feeling never lies.
Pain grows a lot, but you won't see.
So sad about all, everything.
You and me.
So sad about all.
The things we never had.
