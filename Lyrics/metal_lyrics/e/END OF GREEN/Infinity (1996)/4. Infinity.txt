I sit alone in my cold room
the deadly silence comes over me
all is forever all is lost
all I can see are black candles
they shining on me
where can I go when the light go
out today I drown in a deep black sea
all I can see, all I can see is a light
all I see are black candles
when I die in a black
winter night I'm so far away

No memories into the light I fade
screams and convulsions
breakin' the walls of my innerself
all I can see, all I can see is a light
all I see are black candles when I die
in a black winter night I close my eyes
I sleep forever I fade away
never wake up again
