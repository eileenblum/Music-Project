What I see here is beyond the way I never walk
and I see the mistakes of humans
I'm feelin' my life is killing me

It's the other way the other side I'll be tonight
and I see what my illusions means
I'm feelin' it's time to meet my destiny

What I'm feelin' is beyond the way I never walk alone
my life is the price I have to pay
I be alone when I die in this empty rainy night

And I have to search I have lost my way
where ever I go I nver meet my
