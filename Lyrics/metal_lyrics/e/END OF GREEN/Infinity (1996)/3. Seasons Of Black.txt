When I see the pain and sorrow of this earth
when I see a little child die by a war
then I'm feelin' I lost all what I love and hate
then I know the seasons of black run to my head
when I'm walkin' into the mirror of black
then I know I never come back here again
then I'm feelin' I lost all what I love and hate
then I know the seasons of black run to my head
