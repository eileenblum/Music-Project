I'm walkin' home tonight I walk alone
and I feel the pain deep inside

It's a nice day to die
before the sun has reached the sky

I break down on my knees
and I'm lookin' to the sky
I think heaven come down on my head
my best friend died last night in my hands

It's a nice day to die
before the sun has reached the sky
