Where is the sun, where is the light in my mind
I cannot see my eyes are blind
I hear a voice, all is not lost
but we need help from the god

Help me god help me one more time
again

Why are we born when we must die
guestions and no answers in my life
must we believe, must we believe in god
I walk my way to the end of my life

Help me god help me one more time
again
