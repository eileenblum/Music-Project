Deep black clouds disappear into the void
So dark my soul will be you always shine so bright
And I left it all behind on the right
She'll wash away, she'll wash away my pain
And I left it all behind on the right
She'll wash away, she'll wash away my pain
So I'm running, I'm running anway, I'm running away,
So I'm running, I'm running away, I'm running away
I'll disappear I'll disappear in the void
I'll disappear I'll disappear in the void
Disappear in the void
