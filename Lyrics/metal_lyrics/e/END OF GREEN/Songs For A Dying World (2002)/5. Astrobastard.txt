There is no place I can be oh so lonely I feel when this sadness surrounding  my heart
there must be a way on the end final day when I disappear in the dark
I will never be free my whole life buried me don't know where I do belong
so I live in a dream it is not what it seems so it finally ends when I am...
specially dying for my dreams god has chosen me the one
there must be any other way
I don't know where I belong...
