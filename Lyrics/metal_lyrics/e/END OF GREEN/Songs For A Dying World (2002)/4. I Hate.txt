It's coming down all over me can't feel no love tonight
It is so sweet I loose everything I'm lost in my mind
This life is sick I don't know why
I hate myself I want to die

I hate
I hate
I hate
I hate myself

[CHORUS x2:]
I hate
I hate
I hate
I hate myself

Jesus can you listen to me my jeramaid my ray of light
There is no way of any hope
Sun and moon will never shine I can't go on I apologize
There is no way of any hope
This life is sick I don't know why
I hate myself I want to die...
There is no way of any hope

[CHORUS x2]

Jesus can you listen
My jeramaid
I apologize
There is no way of any hope
It is so sweet I loose everything I'm lost in my mind
In my life
In my life
In my life...

[CHORUS x2]

In my life in my life

If Jesus Christ is just alive
In my life
In my life

[BRIDGE x3:]
Or is it just a lie
Or is it just a lie
In my life
In this life

Its just a lie in my life...

Ohhh...
Ohhh...
