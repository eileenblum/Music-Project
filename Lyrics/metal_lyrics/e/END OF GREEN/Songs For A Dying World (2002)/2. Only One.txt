You are the only one that I ever loved
you are the only one that I ever lost
Dead beautiful romance still sleeps on cold ground a neverending long way
to reach your arms the light can no longer shine emptiness drinking of my  veins
you are the only one still I search for your cold heart grief always embrace my heart
I remember you are my last love you are the only one
I remember you are my last love cold skin and blue cold lips undying in my heart
salvation by a deadly kiss
You are the only one....
