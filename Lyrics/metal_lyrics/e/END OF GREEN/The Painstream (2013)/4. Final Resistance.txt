Here in my house down by the river
that's were i hide, waiting in shivers
here in my house live the saint and the killer
jeckyll and hyde, the rivers of liquor
here in your house, down by my river
tragedy flows, my aching liver
here in my house down by the river
that's were i hide, waiting in shivers
i can break through the stair on the airway and heal my very last wounds
i am the final resistance
gimme one last chance
with these tears in my eyes kill the beast
i'm alive
you can break me in parts
i'm going down
with all shattering lies and the air burns tonight
you can't break me in parts
i'm gonna cut you down
this is the last day in my life
goodbye cruel world
i am survived
these are my last words, should scatter the skies
me and the scars in the airways tonight
