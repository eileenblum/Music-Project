Since i see no sun
seems there is no morning
feel my old bones
i'm so fed up with everything
i stick to these guns
they're pointing at me
i got no place to move
i've been so dead for long
i'm miles away from home
dead, i found you
i'm miles away from home
dead, i found you
make no compromises
see the weight that rises
sacrifice the day before you gonna die
baby, you can't stop me now
make no compromise, see the pretty lies
sacrifice the days you know you're going to die
maybe you can't stop me now
i have seen the sunset of fear too long
i have been the one you forced to be strong
