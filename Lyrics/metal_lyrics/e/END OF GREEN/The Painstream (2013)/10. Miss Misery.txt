Oh life it seems we didn't speak a lot
oh tonight we are a million miles apart
i ride along the empty scattered street
these day it seems i'm out of reach
i'm married to pain, could save my heart
but i see a light out from the dark
miss misery right back from the start
open a fire with your spark
it took a long way on the road
and everybody grows if there's anybody out there
my light was lost in darkened caves of me
i climb, it feels like crawling on my knees
i died, at least a thousand times today
i rise, above the sun in hope to burn, yeah, here i stay
