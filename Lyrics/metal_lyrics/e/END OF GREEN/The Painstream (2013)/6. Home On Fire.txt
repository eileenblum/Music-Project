You burn my hometown
now everything is over
now i hunt you, no, you never can be free, it's over
leave this city let me be
see my home is on fire
see my flames burn higher, leave me all alone
i'm dancing on a wire, waiting for the fire
never let me down
you burn my hope down, now celebrate is over
see i had it, see i had it all before
so useless, leave this city let me be
it can't be broken, my fire is lighting in the dark
i never need you, leave before the new day will come
see my hope's a fire
