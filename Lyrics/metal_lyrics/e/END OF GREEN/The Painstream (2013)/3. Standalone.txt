Sweet bad ugly morning
i'm tired again
everything's so boring
i can't trust in pain
because i stand alone in this life, all alone with my fight
i stand alone in this life, all alone with my pride
i stand alone in this life
there's no heat in your light
i stand alone in this life, there's no end to this strife
look at the devil's tree
oh, it looks like me, it looks like me and you
there's something in your way
how nothing can be saved
all my life goes down
