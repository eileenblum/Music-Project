You see me run, run, run to the station
you've seen me hide, hide all life long
i catch the train, train, train out to nowhere
it doesn't matter where i belong
i'll never be backstabbed, backstab me back, stab my back and i'll be gone
you always want it, you never need it
stop changing everything
you always hunt it, you never get it
stop changing everything
and everyday as the mourning breaks again
overnight every midnight is the same
overtime take a look into the scars
you will see me again
it's in the blood, blood, blood, i keep pushing
i feel you run, run through my veins
i'll let it bleed, bleed, bleed on your ashes
it's in my heart what still remains
i'll never be backstabbed, backstab me back, stab me back, stab me back and i'll be gone
