Raving madness in my head
god loves fun, cause i'm not dead
i'm out of control, the devil rejects my soul
i'm not dead, i just don't live
days just take, they never give
make a wish and burn
hoping my ashes may learn
will it ever leave me, leave me alone
will it ever leave me
it has taken my soul
this night, it's been done
this life has been gone
see what we found and see what we've done
the hangman won't be on his feet back again
so burn down this house for your own liberty
you wanna break through the home of the sin
where do you run, the losers will win
beating me up, tearing me down
don't turn around
