I breathe the air that you leave me
disease
i teach you everything
i need, oh i need everything
so don't stop killing me
thrilling me
just keep on planting your hate on me
i bleed
the blood you leave me
decease,
i teach you everything
i need, oh i need nothingness
so don't stop this killing me
thrilling me
just keep on planting your hate on me
i carry all of yours through landscapes
seems like the scenes will never end
we're walking in line miles from nowhere
i carry your lies, you should smile little thing
watch your world going down at the end of the spring
i carry our lies
i carry our hate
it's better you leave than take your last breath
