How you spend your last evening?
Like a ghost on your way.
High hopes in low places.
Exceed to hide of the shame.
Cruel Games.
Sinful, under your spell.
And you failed.
Leaving the low fields out of this hell.

Can you exit this nightmare?
Is the ghost still awake?
High hopes in low places.
All alone, win the race.
Cruel Game.
Simple life loss.
And you failed.
Leaving the low fields, out of this hell.

Under the rays of the sun it's you're killing game.
I'm not the pain in your veins.
Trail of the ghost.
Grace of the lost.

Cruel Games.

And you failed.
Leaving the low fields out of this hell.

Under the rays of the sun it's you're killing game.
I'm not the pain in your veins.

Grace of the lost.
