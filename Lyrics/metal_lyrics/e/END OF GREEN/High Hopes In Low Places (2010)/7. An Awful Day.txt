I hung my head, I'm feeling dead.I know that I am leaving.I spread my wings, can't see the things.This life has stopped to give.I know my end, I know I'm dead.I know that you want see it.I need a rest,release my breath,I know the word for leaving. Can't you see, it will be an awful day.The world I'm leaving, starts to steal it all from me. I'm feeling dead, I hung my head.I know that I am leaving.I spread my wings, can't see the things.This life has stopped to give.I know I'm dead, I know my end.I know that you want see it.I need a rest,release my breath,I know the word for leaving. Can't you see, it will be an awful day.The world I'm leaving, starts to steal it all from me.Would you say, it's too late.I hung my head.And can't you see I would give all I have.
