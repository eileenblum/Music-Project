Where will we be, when our love is gone?
Where is my home, when I'm alone?
Where will I sleep at the end of the day?
Show me the things that I have to do under the sway.

How can we keep somebody?
How can we let somebody feel?
How can we leave behind the missing?
I cannot sleep when I feel dead.
I cannot love when it's so sad.
Where will we be, when all is ending?

Where will we be, when our lovers gone?
There is no hope, we're on a low.
There is no light, in the grave that you made.
Show me a place I don't feel like I'm already dead.

How can we keep somebody?
How can we let somebody feel?
How can we leave behind the missing?
I cannot sleep when I feel dead.
I cannot love when it's so sad.
Where will we be, when all is ending?

Burning, secrets, my life in chains.
Something, I feel you, my love, in chains.

How can we leave behind the missing?
(Somebody's always missing)
How can you do someone has told?
(Somebody will turn bold)

How can we keep somebody?
How can we let somebody feel?
How can we leave behind the missing?
I cannot sleep when I feel dead.
I cannot love when it's so sad.
Where will we be, when all is ending?
