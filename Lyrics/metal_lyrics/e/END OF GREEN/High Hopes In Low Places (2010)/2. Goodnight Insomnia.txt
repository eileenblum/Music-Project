This city bleeds for us,
broken hearts and lovely crust.
We're never coming back for more,
more more more.

We'll take the last chance,
we'll do the last dance.
We'll never come back here no more,
more more more.

And we sleep the night away,
in the morning it's not over.
Never seen the light of day,
we will have to stay here longer.
And we pleased the night to stay,
every time we feel the hunger.

Too close to care, to blind to see,
this city is killing me.
You brought me up, you got me down,
down down down.

We'll swallow nightmares,
collecting "no where"s,
we're never coming back for more,
more more more.

And we sleep the night away,
in the morning it's not over.
Never seen the light of day,
we will have to stay here longer.
And we pleased the night to stay,
every time we feel the hunger.

And we sleep the night away,
in the morning it's not over.
Never seen the light of day,
we will have to stay here longer.
And we pleased the night to stay,
this nightmare's gettin' stronger.
