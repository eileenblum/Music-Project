If I only have a chance tonight of hiding my demise.
No, it would be wasted time, my world has blackened eyes.
Come on, Lady, do it right, you'll conquer me no more.
You know, it could be a lie what I said before.

Unknown faces step inside.
Keep me weak, prepare to fight.
Show me the backyard, leaving the door.
What I'm always fighting for.

If I only have a chance tonight of hiding my demise.
No, it would be wasted time, my world has blackened eyes.
Come on, Lady, do it right, you'll conquer me no more.

Unknown faces step inside.
Keep me weak, prepare to fight.
Show me the backyard, leaving the door.
What I'm always fighting for.

If I only have a chance tonight to walk a million miles,
I would be too far to be a stranger in disguise.
Come on, lady, do it right and talk to me no more.
You know, it could be a lie what I said before.
