A new day, a new night.
And you're walking with the pain.
Did you sleep?
Did you hide, hide all the tears from me?
It's a cruel way, it's a cruel life if you hope to fall away.
It's your demon, that's calling.
You'll too close again.
Tie me a rope while you calling my name.
Counting the days, is it my last right before you saving me from the insane?
Tell me, dead rose, why you're calling my name?
Counting the days that makes you an insane.
The decay that you hide.
And you're walking with the blame.
Did you see new moonlight?
Hide all the shame from me.
It's a new way, it's a new life.
If we hope to find a way.
It's a new wave that's hauling.
Meet my rose again.
This day I am down on my knees, this day I am out of reach.
Can you save me, save me now?
This day I will be in a blaze, this day I will follow your trace, and you take me, take me now.
