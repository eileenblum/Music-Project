Someone plays with fate tonightHe knows itÂ´s gonna take their lifeAnd they kept going onThey fade awayThere is something you canÂ´t seeThe ghosts are talking straight to meWe are the lost ones on this lonely earthWe all leave in the starlightWeÂ´re all weak in the starlightSomeone was afraid that night, afraid to end up left in lightThe days kept going onThat endless wayThereÂ´s something you wonÂ´t seeSomebodyÂ´s leading you and meWe are the last ones on this lonely earthYou wondering why I walk awayYou wondering why IÂ´m far awayYou wondering why it ends tonightYou wondering, why I say goodbye.
