YouÂ´ll never return, my saviourOn every road I walkIn every way of failureWith every heart I chokeThereÂ´s no place I could beStill itÂ´s coming downOh, I hope I could sleep with you still aroundThereÂ´s no way I could beStill itÂ´s coming downOh, I hope I can sleep, when youÂ´re not aroundBe my saviour, in anyone I seeBurning straight down on meIn everyone I seeBe my saviour, in anyone I seeBurning straight down on meBurning straight down on me.
