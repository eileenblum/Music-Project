[Music: Richie, lyrics: Richie]

Inside this freight train full of mental fears
We got something going on
5.000 hps full of energy
A burst of passion, rage and love

Headlights on towards the unknown
There's just one thing that will make us one

Rock and roll, whoa oh
Rock and roll, whoa oh
Rock and roll, whoa oh
Rock and roll

Exxocet!
It's all you need
Open that bottle, share with me
Bring it up, drink it up
Until you scream
Let the music feed your blood
Pierced and stuck right in us all
A burst of passion, rage and love

Headlights on towards the unknown
Let the fire burn within your soul

Rock and roll, whoa oh
Rock and roll, whoa oh
All for one
One for all

[Lukky's solo]
[Richie's solo]

(This is what you wanted)
It's rock and roll
