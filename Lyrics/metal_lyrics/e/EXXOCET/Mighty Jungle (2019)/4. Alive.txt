[Music: Lukky, Chris, lyrics: Lukky, Chris]

We hit the road, time to reload, you got the set on fire
Every night, let it ignite
You're in the crowd, it's getting loud, you got the set on fire
Lights going out, scream, aim n' shout

Passion and thrill, it's all I wanna feel, yeah
You're in for a ride so you better hold tight

All night, bringing us fantasy
Oh yeah, turning me on
Alright, give me some ecstasy
'Cause you're gonna set me free, it makes me feel alive

You hear the shot, just getting hot, we gotta take you higher
Dreaming away, through night n' day
It's getting late, I cannot wait to quench all your desires
It's in your eyes, the need to be wild

Passion and thrill, it's all I wanna feel, yeah
Hard n' loud we will scream our heart out

All night, bringing you fantasy
Oh yeah, turning you on
Hold on, we ain't gonna stop
With our gain to the top, it makes me feel alive

[Lukky's solo]
[Richie's solo]

All night, bringing you fantasy
Oh yeah, turning me on
Alright, we ain't gonna stop
With our gain to the top, it makes me feel alive
All night, bringing you fantasy
Oh yeah, turning you on
Stand high and max out the speed
'Cause it's all that I need, it makes me feel alive

Oh man, can you believe it?
I just can't believe it!

You make me
Feel alive
