[Music: Richie, lyrics: Richie, Chris, Tom]

The fleshly lights are showing
Ravenous colors in the night
Sacrificeâ¦

Hidden faces, mysterious dancing
Like black panthers prowling in the dark
Think twice!

But she's all I need
Wasn't hard to proceed
I took her out of the crowd
Oh, baby spread those golden wings
N' don't let me out

Now I shake so hard behind her back
Like a snake hunting in the grass
To taste the mango flavor of her skin
And the tension in the air is high
'Cause she knows there ain't no alibis
That she could use to get away from me
Cannibal Carnival
It's everything I need
It's everything for me
Carnal Carnival

I take you, tame you, lay you down
My time, my fantasy
Every time I feel your lips collidin' on my body made of ecstasy
Let me drown my face in your sweat (Sex!)
Until, the mighty drums stop their beats

'Cause you're all I need
I finally got ya next to me
Maybe you ain't got no crown
But you're the prettiest queen I know
That makes me hit the ground

Now I shake so hard behind your back
Like a snake hunting in the grass
To taste the mango flavor of your skin
And the tension in the air is high
'Cause you know there ain't no alibis
That you could use to get away from me
Cannibal Carnival
She's everything I need
She's everything for me
Carnal Carnival

Crank it upâ¦
Go!

Let me grab your hips
While I'm feeling your wild touch
No one can resist
This one-night thing, oh no

[Richie's solo]
[Lukky's solo]

No one cares
No one cares about this love
Cannibal, yeah
