[Music: Richie, Chris, lyrics: Chris, Richie]

We've been waiting for a hundred years
Now the chains are breaking up
No one helped us when we made the call
We moved on

Now we're leaving all behind
Thousands standing by our side
So you better step aside
Just let me go, 'cause I'm aiming high

You're hearing the screams from the south
The sound of our raging roar
Now we remember who we are
The screams from the south

We've been waiting for a thousand years
And the sun is shining on
We are tearing down the wall of fears
Marching on

Now we're leaving all behind
There are thousands by our side
Metal soldiers in the night
So you better stand high, don't give up the fight

You're hearing the screams from the south
The sound of our raging roar
'Cause now we remember who we are
The screams from the south

[Richie's solo]

You're hearing the screams from the south
The sound of our raging roar
Now we remember who we are
The screams from the south

For all those who live in my words
By the sound of this raging roar
Always remember who we are
South!
