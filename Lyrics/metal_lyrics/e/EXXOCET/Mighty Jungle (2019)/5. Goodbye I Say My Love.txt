[Music: Richie, lyrics: Richie, Lukky]

Walking down the streets of loneliness
Time's passing by n' you're not here
Tryin' so hard to put up with this pain
But I just can't win the fight against my tears
Every time the sun goes down on my window
I feel your angel calling through my door

Goodbye I say my love
For the moment
Goodbye I say my love
This is the moment
To leave the place you roam, help me find the way back home
Goodbye I say my love
Please tell me that I'm not alone

Trying so hard to find you
Sometimes not to remind you
Just trying to find my way out of this madness
My heart is shouting at me no more
'Cause I should have been the one who had to go
What would I give to turn back time and hold you in my arms again
'Cause I still love you so much more, much more than yesterday

Goodbye I say my love
For the moment
Goodbye I say my love
This is the moment
To leave the place you roam, help me find the way back home
Goodbye I say my love
Please tell me that I'm not alone

[Lukky's solo]

Goodbye I say my love
For the moment
Goodbye I say my love
This is the moment
To leave the place you roam, help me find the way back home
Goodbye I say my love
Goodbye I say my love, say my love
Save my love!

Oh, baby, baby, baby, tell me what it's like
Goodbye I say my love
Please tell me that I'm not alone
