[Music: Richie, lyrics: Richie]

Open my eyes full of energy
As I feel my temperature rise
It seems that it's gonna be alright!
Loving this girl who has been
Just a sin, a little scene in my life
It seems that it's gonna be
All night

I jumped out of bed as I heard my song (where the down boys go!)
I put on my pants and I walked through her door

Party's calling every time
In these hot, hot summer nights
Palm trees, sand, drinks and fun!
In these hot, hot summer nights
Won't be hard to lose my mind
So save your words and don't ask why
I am loving every gal
In these hot, hot summer nights

Ocean's breeze at this place
There ain't no trace that you can steal from my feet
Luau is already done with Latin beats
And now she goes on with the sun
A beauty I just can't ignore
I can't wait to tease her
On and on
Summer nights!

[Richie's solo]

I'm begging, I'm praying, I'm burning with desire
Party rocks!

Party's calling every time
In these hot, hot summer nights
Palm trees, sand, drinks and fun!
In these hot, hot summer nights
Won't be hard to lose my mind
So save your words and don't ask why
Yes, I am loving every gal.
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have a good time, good time!
In these summer nights!
