[Music: Lukky, Danny, lyrics: Lukky, Danny]

Night by night, 5 to 5
I'm sitting here just doing night shifts
I always thought it's alright
That day by day I've been throwing away my life

'Cause every night across the street I see them going in
Just laughing, teasing, staring, pleasing life away

Ni-ni-ni-night and day
I'll live my life for what it's right throughout this night and day
I'll never be the same again, night and day
Give me another chance, give me another way to find my pleasure everyday
Give me another taste, and nothing left to waste
Night and day

Momma never came back from that door she closed (gotta get away)
Since then I've lived my life in vain
But now I'll go insane!

I'm gonna tear this life apart and make the world obey
(There will be some bad, bad company tonight, don't forget your wallets and come on in!)

Ni-ni-ni-night and day
I'll live my life for what it's right throughout this night and day
I'll never be the same again, night and day
Give me another chance, give me another way to find my pleasure everyday
Give me another taste, and nothing left to waste
Night and day

Ni-ni-ni-night and day
I'll live my life for what it's right throughout this night and day
I'll never be the same again, night and day
Give me another chance, give me another way to find my pleasure everyday
Give me another taste, and nothing left to waste
Night and day
