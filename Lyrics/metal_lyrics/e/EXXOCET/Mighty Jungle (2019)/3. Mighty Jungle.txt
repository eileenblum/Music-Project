[Music: Richie, Lukky, lyrics: Lukky, Richie]

Green and gray, the sunlight fades with the sunset in my eyes
Jungle never waits, we're running late for the carnival tonight
Lethal snakes n' jacarÃ©s who'll try to bring you down
So you better be brave, 'cause you're coming with me
We're taking back the crown

There's no place
Like the one you'll see tonight
So watch your step
If you're willing to survive
(Feel alive)

Mighty jungle
There's everything you want
Mighty jungle
There's everything you need
We will reign this place, this amazonic way of life
Inside this mighty jungle

Watch out! Flashin' lights
Hold on to your hanging vine
We're gonna slide down the hall of fame
To tame all those fuckers n' suckers who leave us to blame

There's no way
There's no chain
The onÃ§a will hunt them, there ain't no escape
Welcome to my place

Mighty jungle
It's everything you want
Mighty jungle
It's everything you need
We will rock this place, until they hit the ground
Inside this mighty jungle
Go!

[Keyboard solo]

[Richie's solo]

Mighty jungle
There's everything you want
Mighty jungle
There's everything you need
We will reign this place, this amazonic way of life
Inside this mighty jungle
We will rock this place
With a different kind of sound
Inside this mighty jungle
