[1]
No longer forces
World turned to black aches
Plague's trace in every home
Today we live tomorrow we're gone
No longer forces
Nowhere to run fire surrounds
Massed death
Infection creeps the agony moan
[2]
No longer forces
Germ of death blood is sisk
Plague's trace in every home
Today we live tomorrow we're gone
No longer forces
Who will save the hopes in earth?
Rotting world follows you
You wanna live but death you do
[3]
No longer forces
Shade of death persecutes you
Pain oppresses throat with blood
Tearing soul with bony hand
No longer forces
Man lives in fean like a rat
Black aches world
I see you in the noose no forces.
