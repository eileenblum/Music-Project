[1]
War don't frighten with gore
I will never follow you
I don't like your way to fight
I don't even think to die
I won't march under your flag
I won't be able to creep undead
You can't make me to kill and fight
I don't ever think to die
[2]
I see your victories are shit
I want my mind to be clear
I don't like your way to fight
I don't even think to die
Cold death is waiting for me
I will never follow you
You can't make me to kill and fight
I don't ever think to die
[3]
I have no need to know how to kill
Don't spoil my way to live
Don't spoil my way to live
I don't need your fuckin rewards
After coffins of total war.
