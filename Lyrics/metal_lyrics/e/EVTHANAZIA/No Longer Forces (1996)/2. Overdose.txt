[1]
Syringe in vein the overdose
Death agony of flosh and soul
A pleasant quake the mind is mist
Life goes away the drug you feel
Overdose blood wants it again
Minutes off you feel the end
Uina a sleep,no vision of death
When you die your pleasuke spends.

Syringe in vein the overdose
Body ruins a fiaht of drugs
Opium mind turns to rot
What's gonna be with you?
Overdose finally came
The scream of fun-inanity
Venom eats away like acid
Brain and soul are omptyness
[3]
Overdose you are did
Syringe in vein meet the end
Acidhead no need to live
Destroyed brain the death is nerk
Overdose blood wants it again
Minutes off you feel the end
There's no friends life fades away
Noone will help you to born again.
