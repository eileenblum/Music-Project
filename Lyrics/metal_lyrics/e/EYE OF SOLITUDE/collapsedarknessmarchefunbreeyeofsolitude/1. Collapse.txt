[performed by Eye of Solitude]All these souls, entwined
In nowhere to grieve
The loss upon us
Calling indifference
Forgotten memories
Fallen like ashes in vain
The scorn evil collapses towards down to earth
Whispering fears
The sins of life to pained existence
In the arms of perdition
On your knees tremble cold
Of denial ascending towards you
Memories torn ever by rendered rain
Entangled by you
Entangled by us
