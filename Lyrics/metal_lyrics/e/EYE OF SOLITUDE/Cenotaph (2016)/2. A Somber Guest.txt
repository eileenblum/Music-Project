daylight has reached its end, fallen from disgrace
witness of my pain embalmed in buried tears
all these years i came from the dark
i kept the screaming
fallen days, your grace,loved and lonely
this warning, i invited him in
a somber guest before me
truth was dead as i was walking in tears
digrace unspoken
all this time i headed above
I wept,haunted...before a somber guest
