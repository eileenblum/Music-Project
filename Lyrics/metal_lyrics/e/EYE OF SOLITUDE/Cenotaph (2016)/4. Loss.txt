the shadows remain and darkness fills me in
deep wounds confide the ashes of all time
the shadows enter my heart
imagination follows now
hidden shadows enter your world
but tomorrow they break
in mourning these are my thoughts
hidden shadows follow now
but tomorrow they break
the mourners follow now
and they'll take all your pain
for your depair
the mourners are marching slow
to weep their souls alone
who enters this void alone?
the mourners
are marching slow
to weep their souls alone
