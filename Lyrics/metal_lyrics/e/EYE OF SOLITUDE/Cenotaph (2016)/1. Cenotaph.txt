scorn and confined, torn and withered,
mesmerised in sorrow
I will suffer, alone, dead and forgotten .
I awake imprisoned
here i am in front of this cenotaph
fallen, alone
scorn and confined, torn and withered,
mesmerised.
alone.
these are my last words
indiferrent, as the sky above
grief is taking my heart
like no one else.
