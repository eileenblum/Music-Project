[performed by Eye of Solitude]I am not dead
I do not sleep
I am the thousand rains
I'm in the tunnel deep
I'm the blooded snow
I, the sinner on lifeless trails
I hear this cancer of the soul
I wish the dark
I'm this cage

Eyes will turn to bliss
The burden of loss
Eternal song
Of grief
The look awoken in the darkened lush
I am the soft mourning of death
The taller voids soon will reign
Do not stand at my grave
And cry
I did not die
Don't stand at my blooded grave
I am not there
I did not die
