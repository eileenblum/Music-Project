Wait for this entagled
angel oblivious I awake from beyond
then the darkness whispers names of the dead
alone I wonder through time
through life

in the end im broken 
I want peace 
solitary weakness 
wakes with the end

one life - pretentious 
infimous meaning 
when life rejects you 
impatiently

it flies forever
infinitly
feel no redemption
forged in deceit

wait for this entagled
angel oblivious I awake from beyond
then the darkness whispers names of the dead 
alone I wonder through time
through time
