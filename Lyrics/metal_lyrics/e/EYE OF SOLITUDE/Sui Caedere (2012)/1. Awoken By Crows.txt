Breathing in inexistence 
open to you
every burnt offer over weeping 
for too long

who am i to judge you? 
bowed down in tears of blood 
who am I but to see the truth 
from the unknown scars 
from the ashes of my soul?

greed paid in eternity every other night; waiting
now follow me
to a place far beyond

all for nothing, devouring, caressing your brain

forging in dreams so bitter
followed by fear 
mourning the carved memory
awoken by crows

i feel tike suffocating, pleased in misery 
i feel my ground is snaking 
the fear of dying alone
