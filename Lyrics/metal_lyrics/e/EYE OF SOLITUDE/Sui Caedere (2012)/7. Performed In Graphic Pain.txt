Bowed down - on the other side 
fate has all those strange encodings 
grieving within for the horrid feelings

almost dead from everlasting pain
paid for with the austere craving
grieving within for the horrid feelings

all for eternity
in inequity
for the life I once had

grieve for the amnesty is eternity 
false in skies
