Crawled inside whispering
with open mind in between
in my mind the cause of death is
you

dreams of war
they follow way beyond myself
with the end between you
with the air i breathe
I fall
in the realms of inveracity
despondency through dreams

I fall behind
for everytime my heart is breaking
within

for the rose in your hand that fades
every strigoi screaming
for every thought and every cross
that i bury inside me with you
