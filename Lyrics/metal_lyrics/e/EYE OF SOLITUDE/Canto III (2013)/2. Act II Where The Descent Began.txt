Bodies of old
Irreplaceable in sin
And you forget your memories
For eternity

They are the scars inside
Die alone
Untrivial
As Death comes near

The tyrrants of the soul
Arrive
Devouring all your thoughts
And life

Sinfully
Await
To die alone untrivial
As my death comes dear

Leave
Leave me here
Turn and forget
Slow and incomplete
Flows this life

Calator prin lume
De sfarsit ma ating
Acolo unde-i lumea de apoi

Take All this pain
Wake From this dream
See the shades
Of nothingness
Through the light
Of your constant shame

Sorrow fell
Hard and blackened
On the altor of broken thoughts
Here and after
Deeper down
Where the descent began
