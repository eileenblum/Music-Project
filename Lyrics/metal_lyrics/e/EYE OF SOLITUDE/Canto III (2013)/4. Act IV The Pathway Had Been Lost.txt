The fall
From this world
Caught within
Remembering to uphold the rotting grief
From beyond the downfall
It lives
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be one
From beyond the grave
It feeds
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be all

Rest
For i have watched over you
Rest
For I am here

Why?
Why in this torment must i sink?
Why must i bleed?

The fall
From this world
Caught within
Remembering to uphold the rotting grief
From beyond the downfall
It lives
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be one
From beyond the grave
It feeds
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be whole
