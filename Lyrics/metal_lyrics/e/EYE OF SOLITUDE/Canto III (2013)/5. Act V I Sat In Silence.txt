In this poor tragedy
All seems veiled in more shame
Are we now dead
Yet
Are we now alone?

Die with me
Devour your shame
Burn with me
Deny your shame

I sat in silence
I sat all alone
I felt the cold kiss of death
Feeling so warm

I sat in silence
Waiting my turn to be judged

I betrayed you
Don't fight it - embrace it with me
Suffer alone - You
Mortally sinned - I wish
That in your hands
Carefully bleeds your pain
In this poor tragedy
All seems veiled in more shame
Are we now dead
Yet
Are we now alone?
