Fear - no one else in this dream
Sorrow - scarring no one else
Stay in my dreams
Follow me
End your soul
Remorse feeds the pain
Even though
The soul bleeds

How hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest
Savaged rough and stern
Which in my every thoughts renewes the fear
So bitter it is
And death is a little more
But of the good to treat
Which there i found
Speak will i of the other things i saw
I cannot well repeat
How there i entered

So full was i of slumber
At the moment which i was abandoned
In a true way breath i have reached
And i saw and i felt
At the point i knew the valley was terminated
Which had when consternation pierced my hearth
Although upward i looked
And i beheld my shoulders

Vested already with the planet's rays
Which leadeth onto the night or day
Then it was the fear
A little quieter
That in my heart's like had endured throughout
And the night...
Oh no the night which i had passed so pittiously
And even as he
He who disturbed my slumber
With his distressful breath
Turns to the word
Perilous
And gazed
And so did my soul
That still was playing ownward
Turned itself to be behold the pass
Which never
Never yet a living person left
After my weary body i had rested
The way resumed
I on this desert slope
So that the firm foot ever was the lower
And lower and
Lower above the rage of Death

Mourning the soul
Prays in void
He
Who meets the sorrow

All left in slumber
Soul dismembered
He who willingly suffers
