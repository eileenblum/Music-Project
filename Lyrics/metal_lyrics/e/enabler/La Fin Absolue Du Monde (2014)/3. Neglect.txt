Letâs burn our home so thereâs no place to go
No coming back with a fire in our eyes, no lies to hide behind
Prey up on the fragile and innocent, no respect for life but our own
Weâll be rewarded with wrath and vengeance
Canât get the bullshit out of the way, canât face our problems on our own
Iâll fight my battles with the words I write
There is no coming back from watching the world turn to ash
Iâll stick it out âtil the very end
I wished for sleep and inner peace, but I canât hide from what is real
If this is my time then I will meet you headstrong with a heart of steel
In this time of desperation, a few are living with ease
Grant my wish for separation from this living disease
No sense of purpose or security
Acting blind witness to hypocrisy
Nothing can stop the future from living in regret
Nothing can stop the future from living in neglect
