âWe all pay for life with death, so everything in between should be freeâ
I could never find the inner link, itâs everywhere and in between
Weâre falling down onto the floor, old wounds to open sores
Suffer through the aftermath of everything and in between
I could never find inner peace where my wounds are open sores
âWe all pay for life with death, so everything in between should be freeâ
I will always find pure nothingness and luxury in glass pipe dreams
Withering with emptiness, heart turns to ash, the hatred is poisoning
Nothing can stop the balance, the balance of terror
Everything is clean where everything is clearer
Look into the future, calm burns the fire
Ashes are the truth when we burn the liar
Nothing can stop the balance where peace brings us terror
Ashes are the truth when we burn the liar
We will burn the liar
