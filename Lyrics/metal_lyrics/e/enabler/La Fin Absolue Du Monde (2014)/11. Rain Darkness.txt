Youâre childrenâs children will be made to slaves, youâre wives and daughters raped and sold
Money and fear have made their claim
Bring about the apocalypse, a better option than giving into fear
All will cease to exist
In a fight to the death the god of war will be raped of his immortality
Fight my way from the inside out, peace will exist when everything is gone
All hail the new god of war, worship with an unshakeable will
Confidence is gained by fear; I have no doubt in my disbelief
Youâre waving the white flag, torn in the face of defeat but never can we retreat
The bells of war are ringing without an army to fight for our cause
My life will cease to exist
Darkness rains over the battlefield, my heart aches at the memories of those who I wonât see again
I know that this is my final breath and I will face it with all of my strength
Peace will exist when I am gone
I will not give into fear
