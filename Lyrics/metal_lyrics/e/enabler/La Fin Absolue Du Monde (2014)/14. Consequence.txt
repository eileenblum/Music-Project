Nothing is sacred and nothing is free
Everyone is feared and no one is left to be
Suffering the truth of our hypocrisy
Some walk through life and never see the sea
Forced to live a stagnant life never living up to your dreams
The consequence will be what the consequence will be
Forced to live a stagnant life never living up to your dreams
The consequence will be what the consequence will be
