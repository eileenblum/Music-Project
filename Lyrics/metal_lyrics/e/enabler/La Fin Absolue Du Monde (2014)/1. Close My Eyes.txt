Thereâs gotta be something; thereâs gotta be something that keeps everything from falling apart
Rather be dead, rather be dead, Iâd rather be dead than say the words Iâve said
Thereâs gotta be some way out of here; thereâs gotta be some way out of here
Rather be dead, rather be dead, youâd rather be dead than feel the hate Iâve fed
Thereâs gotta be some way out of here; thereâs gotta be some way out of here
Close my eyes and wish for death
Thereâs gotta be some way out of here
