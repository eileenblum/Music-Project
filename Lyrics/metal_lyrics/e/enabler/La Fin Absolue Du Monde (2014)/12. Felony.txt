We sacrificed everything because thereâs nothing more that we can lose
Bliss through ignorance when there is everything that we can gain
My heart dropped when you opened your mouth, I need an antidote of goodwill
If this is all you stand for, this is all that I fucking have
And I swear to you that Iâll keep it true through the darkness of night
Lines after line, time after time, carry me on until the dawn breaks
Lives lost â My rent is payable on death
So cold â Feel the burn of my broken heart
Lives lost â You were robbed from us before your time was up
So cold â Feel the burn of my broken heart
I remember your apartment infested with flies, getting so fucked up we couldnât walk
Making fun of your edge tattoos, this never should have happened
Donât worry about the bike you lost, or my dadâs CSNY record
We should have shared the road like brothers, this wasnât supposed to happen
I miss you more and more every day, you were freer than Iâll ever be
We should have shared the road like brothers, this wasnât supposed to happen
âHello my friend, it looks like Iâll never see you again
We lost touch so long ago; you never had a phone or a permanent address
You had a heart of gold, youâll stay young forever, and youâll never grow old
Youâll never hear this song, but know this song is my goodbye to youâ
