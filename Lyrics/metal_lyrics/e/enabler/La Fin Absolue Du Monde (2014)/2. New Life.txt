This is what it feels like with a gun to your back, I realize my own fate and give it a new name
Turn the cards with the ace in your stack, nothing stops the pain, nothing stays the same
I am begging for new life, a new breath to end our unease
We all travel for new life, a new breath in a pity of existence
I walk this path alone, searching for a hint of understanding
I feel this fear in my bones, trying to ignore my sense of loss
The dead will talk; the dead bear witness
The dead will talk; the dead bear witness
Sacred is the breath that breathes new life
A simple touch to share our land
Sacred is the breath that breathes new life
A familiar face to take a stand
I am begging for new life, a new breath to end our unease
We all travel for new life, a new breath in a pity of existence
I walk this path alone, searching for a hint of understanding
I feel this fear in my bones, trying to ignore my sense of loss
