Repeat a circle of defeat, no home to fall in retreat
Soldier on for a lost cause â no benefit, nothing to believe in
This song is a battleground, everyone speaks and no one listens
Bear your burdens on a confidant; expect a handout or a hefty reward
No thought for the children, no thought for the future
No care for a safety net, the lights go out and we lack reason
Letâs pretend like nothing happened
I donât belong
