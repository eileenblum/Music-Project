I feel imprisoned by the choices I have made
I feel betrayed by myself I used to trust
Locked into a future that I cannot escape
No matter who you are, we all share the same fate
This dead end path is no different from the other
Waiting for the end as soon as Iâm awake
Never any sleep, no time away from each other
No matter who you are, we all share the same fate
God save us, weâre failing, weâre falling
Grant me the cure, weâre breeding with disease
Mother of fire grant me a kiss
To sterilize the world, to sanitize this place
When I got to where I was heading, I fell down
Swallowed whole by the ground, I refused to get up
I have no other choice, I refuse to give up
I have no other choice, itâs all or fucking nothing
No future, no fate â thereâs nothing but the lies we make
