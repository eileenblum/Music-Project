What the fuck kind of legacy are we leaving behind?
Sulking in our selfishness alone
Stuck in a war for blood, we are our own worst enemy
Consume, contaminate and crash and burn â the beat of our hearts will never return
I canât keep up with anything thatâs ever fucking going on â Information overload
I canât stop myself from staring at a goddamn screen â Information overload
We all needed someone to place the blame on
It could have been you, it could have been me
Weâre all just too afraid to take a look at ourselves
Who fucked up, was it you, was it me?
I donât know I think weâre all at fault
Itâs too late so letâs suffer the loss together
