Death came down to the center of peace
He wore a white face, covered in hate
No remorse for the innocent
His life was taken as a necessary loss
Iâm sick
Why do you care about what doesnât affect you?
You can live your own life free to have rest
But you carry such weight, you carry such hate
I canât figure out how youâre so fucking stubborn
A wake up call to the population
Prejudice and division is something we canât take
We carry such weight; weâre so full of hate
We hold on to worthless traditions, taking away our own human rights
Iâm sick
Iâm sick of living on stolen land
We are cursed from actions that are from anotherâs hand
Sickened by the wake, sickened by the wake
Iâm sick of living with prejudice
We divide ourselves with no love for each other
Sickened by the wake, sickened by the wake
