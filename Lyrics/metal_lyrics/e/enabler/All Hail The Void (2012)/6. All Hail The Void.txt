I can see the future thereâs an end in sight, there is only darkness there is never light
Revenge of mother earth, no more human rights, theyâve ignored the questions in an angry flight
We take a step forward to an unknown world, face the ugly truth of a bitter tomorrow
Setting up the stages in a fight for survival, weâre living in desolation row
I can see the future thereâs an end in sight, there is only darkness there is never light
Apocalyptic clash from an unknown fear, the war machine turns with well-oiled gears
Daylight is silenced, all order has failed
The wasteland reigns supreme, weâre living in desolation row
All hail the void â there is no light in the prevailing darkness
Cannot move forward â find yourself caught in a standstill of time
All hail the void â there is no light in the prevailing darkness
Cannot move forward â find yourself caught in a standstill of time
All hail the void
The wasteland reigns supreme, weâre living in desolation row
