The tides will turn and seasons change
My devotion will never fail
Love has a will, love has a way
A shield that protects me from anyone
A shield that protects me from everything
I believe in self-worth, trust in inner nature
Something worth living for, something worth dying for
Carry on for truth, carry on for honor
When friendship fails and life derails, a constant struggle that you must face
Nothing can stop the feeling, nothing can stop the fight
Rise above the status quo, I gave up on an average life
We must alter course in order to do whatâs right
The tides will turn and seasons change
My devotion will never fail
Bury me six feet deep and these songs will keep on living
This is my true love â you canât take this from me
Ultimate sacrifice
