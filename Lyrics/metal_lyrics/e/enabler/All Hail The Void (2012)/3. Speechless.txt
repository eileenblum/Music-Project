I picked up the phone, dialed your number when I realized we were homeward bound
I kept a picture of you, caught in the moment â it kept my feet on the ground
With you by my side we could talk for hours without making a sound
You were my anchor when there was no one around
Then one day you never came, you never showed your face
I can feel the taste burning within
Baptized in fire, in fury, in flames â the passion that runs in my veins
Itâs all out on the table, downpour the reigns
There is no shit to be talked, just a walk to be walked
I apologize for all the harshness
You were closer to me than the others could see
You walked me through the darkness
Thereâs nothing left for us to say â you left me speechless
