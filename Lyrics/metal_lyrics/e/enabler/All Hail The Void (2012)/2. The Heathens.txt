Fiend, evoke the diabolical force
Conform to sin serpents of viscera
Dwell in the dregs of civilization
Deter the arteries of existence
Infiltrate the bulk of the worldâs religions
We will drop like flies
Liar, you bear false witness
Hellhounds, evoke malevolence
Feeding off temptation
Feeding off despair
Feeding off apathetic desire
It pretends to care
Traitor [4x]
