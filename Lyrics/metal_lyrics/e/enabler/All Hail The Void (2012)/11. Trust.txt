Iâm suffocating from mediocrity
Give the death blow, cut the heart out
Senseless kids are unstable stepping stones
Use them up for all theyâre worth
Once your feet are wet let them drown with the rest
Iâll shit on your name with my last breath
Donât you know where the fuck you are?
Donât you know where the fuck you stand?
Punk rock cred wouldnât feed the thrill
Corporations are paying the bills
Sharks keep moving with the bottom in sight
Disgraced low life, you canât swim with the best
Justify your existence through a petty excuse
So afraid to face the ugly truth
Iâd knock your teeth out but I fear infection
Youâre not the first train wreck without direction
These walls are crumbling from insurrection
We believe in the same faith yet we are a contradiction
Iâve lost my faith in you, in what should I trust?
