I need you to listen with open ears and an open mind
I need you to understand something that youâve never heard before
The worldâs a lot bigger than the be all end all that you think you are
You say youâll do it yourself but Iâm the one whoâs been doing this for you
You have no respect for living life
Youâre never wrong, youâre always right
You have no respect for living life
Youâre never wrong, youâre always right
Youâre not helping your friends and youâre not helping yourself
So drag your friends down, so drag yourself down
Youâre wasting your hate on the wrong fucking person
So drag your friends down, so drag yourself down
You have no respect for living life
Youâre never wrong, youâre always right
You have no respect for living life
Youâre never wrong, youâre always right
They live, we sleep
