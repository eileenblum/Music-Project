The human infection is coming; weâll show no fucking mercy
Submerge myself in this living hell, rot like thereâs no tomorrow
We all struggle with the will to live; reality will slap you in the face
Life is hard truth that you can love or hate, so fucking bittersweet
Itâs like waking up from the best fuck that youâve ever had
to realize your dick was chewed off and youâre left pissing blood
Inner demons will fuck you like youâve never been fucked before
Life is hard truth that you can love or hate, so fucking bittersweet
Fuck today for all itâs worth, no hope for tomorrow
Fuck the world it all gets torched, nothing to follow
No hope, no feeling â we are so hollow
No mercy, no healing â we are so shallow
