Iâm enthralled by the idea of your savior; I donât believe that the dead will walk
The idea of the martyr is strong until you profit from his will
Belief and hope can fill the soul but reality defeats a false hope
If your savior came back today, he would be a false prophet
No one is coming back from the dead
Godâs children profit off the poor
You can grant me eternal damnation
Iâm not afraid, Iâll see you there
No one is coming back from the dead [4x]
