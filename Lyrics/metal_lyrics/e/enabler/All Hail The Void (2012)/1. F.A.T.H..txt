I wanna see this city burn all the way to the fucking ground
The great lakes could swallow the state, I wouldnât drag them for a soul
Let the dead bury the dead, where sleeping corpses lie
Iâm all heart and no bullshit, Iâm not afraid to take the fall
Life goes on without you
Life goes on with or without you
I wanna see this city burn âtil thereâs nothing fucking left
