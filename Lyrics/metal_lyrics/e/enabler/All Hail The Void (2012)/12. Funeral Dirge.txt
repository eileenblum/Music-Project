I think you want the world to end; itâs all that you live for
Relying on false predictions â the future is late
Inflated egos burn hot with a magnetic pulse
Living with this deathbed curse â there is hope for survival
Call on the gods of rapture â tell them they are late
I was told that tomorrow would never come
This is the last day that you will collect our funds
Canât stop the funeral dirge
Canât stop this deathbed curse
Canât stop the funeral dirge
The song of death that never ends
Apocalyptic march for death
We are one in this funeral choir
Sing the tune of the funeral song
A song of death that that never ends
