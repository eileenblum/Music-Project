Five years ago you were the hero of the day
You inspired myself and others to turn our lives around
You lost yourself in throwing your life away
I donât believe, I donât believe your soul will ever be found
Save yourself from falling down(x4)
No more excuses, no more regrets
No more absolutions to give into
Confrontation lies at your front door
Plead ignorance
Plead ignorance for the lack of inspiration
You are a bane of existence
Life bruised from always falling down
You offer no resistance
Your soul will never be found
I have nothing to offer â you can save yourself
