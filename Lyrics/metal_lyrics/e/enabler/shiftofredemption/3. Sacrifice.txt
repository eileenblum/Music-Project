1, 2, 3 and youâre hittinâ the floor, 5, 6, 7 and youâre goinâ to heaven
4 and 8 canât appreciate the scum of the earth livinâ life on the tracks
We engineer our fate with every breath and every action
The ink is fresh on my own death warrant
There is no coming back from bridges that were turned to ash
The journey home is a faded dream of a pitch black faded abyss
Life in ruins, a simple sacrifice
Life in ruins is equaled by the love we make
Life in ruins, a simple sacrifice
Life in ruins is equaled by the love we take
