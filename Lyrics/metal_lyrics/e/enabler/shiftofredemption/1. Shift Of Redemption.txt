Iâve been looking for answers to questions that have no fucking answer
Staring from the bottom to the top wondering what itâs like to look down
There are truths on every side that you can only find while looking straight
What is there to say when truth leaves no satisfaction?
Snakes turn this place into a desert
Afraid to bite the hand that feeds
Out of comfort we accept a life where we have no control
The higher you climb, the farther you fall in a never ending roll
Break the neck of the one who owns your soul
Fire the warning shot to alarm the masses
Snakes turn this place into a desert
Afraid to bite the hand that feeds
Shift of redemption, consume us all
Shift of redemption, catch me when I fall
Nothing can quench the thirst of a throat thatâs been stripped raw
There is nothing left to feel
But the pain will wake you like a jackal above the law
Nothing can stop the end, never see the light again
