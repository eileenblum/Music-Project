Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you forever
I donât care who are, what youâve done or what youâre gonna do
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you forever
You live by the label but never lead by example
Live life low
âYou ask me how Iâm doing, you ask me where Iâve been, I fake a smile and tell you everythingâs alrightâ
What do you expect when you give up nothing and you work for nothing
No hope, no hope, no fucking handouts, no hefty rewards
We choke, we choke, we choke from the lives we make
No hope, no hope, no fucking handouts, no hefty rewards
