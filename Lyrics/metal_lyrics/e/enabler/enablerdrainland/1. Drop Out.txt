Time stopped, Iâve given up, third world copout
I think itâs time to give in, suck it up
Pissed on, shit on, left for dead drop out
I think you found a hole to fall in
I want you to feel what I feel and see what I see
Blind to love, blind to hate, you canât give in to indifference
Convince me that Iâm wrong; convince me that Iâm right
I donât care because I have myself to carry me on until the dawn breaks
Carry me on until the dawn breaks; carry me on until the dawn breaks
We know the taste of death
We know the taste, the taste of death; we know the taste, the taste of death
We know the taste of death
This is the last kiss of the condemned
