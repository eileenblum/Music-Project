It was the middle of the night; I took a drive to search for you
A game of hide and seek for those not wanting to be found
The rain kept falling, I kept on crawling
I will not stop until the sunrise wears me down
I bled my heart and soul to tape â I wonât let you sleep forever
Iâll stand strong with my brothers â I wonât let you sleep forever
I woke up from a dream last night; cold sweats wonât tear me down
I found myself cuddled in sheets, no pillow to rest my head
I kept on screaming, you kept on walking
If you stray from the path, Iâll put myself to the test
I bled my heart and soul to tape â I wonât let you sleep forever
Iâll stand strong with my brothers â I wonât let you sleep forever
All I want is you to hear this song
All I want is you to hear this song
I kept on screaming â youâre not alone, youâre not alone
Youâre not alone, youâre not alone, youâre not alone, youâre not alone
