I donât mean for this to be a cry for help but more of a plea for awareness
That there is this black cloud that surrounds myself and all of my fucking friends
Giving in is giving up and itâs not a fucking option
One way or another we will soldier on
When the odds are against you â close the fucking door
Turn your fucking back because this black cloud will immerse you
Flash flood, landslide
You have nothing to gain from stopping me
What the fuck is wrong with this world inside and out
Weâll suffocate from the smog in the air
Faster and faster we turn into cancer
Letâs start a fire to signal the heavens
Nothing matters
This is the catalyst breathing my life new air
What a meaningless life to live
What a meaningless life to live
What a meaningless life to live
