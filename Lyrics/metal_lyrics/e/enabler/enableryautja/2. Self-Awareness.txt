I canât speak clearly, Iâm so choked up
Doors lock from the outside, I canât give into retreat
Why live for tomorrow when I could live for today?
So consumed by the fire, exhale flames of defeat
Iâm guilty for charges of arson burning in my heart
My companions are rotting corpses â rotting, rotting, rotting
Humanity can suffer the loss, it doesnât even matter
Weâll have a drink when the world is lost, but weâll remain silent
Donât you know where the fuck you are?
You wanna call me a liar; you wanna call me a thief?
Take a look in the mirror; you lost all your fucking teeth
