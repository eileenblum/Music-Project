No pain save the pain of salvation, no pain saves the pain of realization
I canât help the feeling; I want this to be over
We will crash; we will burn on through the night
Weâll sleep; one will stay up and drive on through the night
Empty pockets, sickness, and starvation â this is a way of life
Inebriation, a vehicle of disease; intoxication, dead to the world but weâll wake in the light
We will crash; we will burn on through the night
Weâll sleep; one will stay up and drive on through the night
A refuge for the scum of the earth, the rejects make a place of their own
A living hell is what some would call it, for us itâs a living reality
We suffer day by day; we lose each other to humanity
Iâm urging for the rapture of heart
Iâm urging for the rapture of heart
