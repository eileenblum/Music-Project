No more will I place my trust in you
No more will I put my faith in you
False hope for everyone thatâs involved in this plan
Fucked up â fuck politics, fuck conscience, fuck reason
There is no one coming to save me, Iâll save myself
So this is what it feels like to be broken by my own hand
Iâm fucking war torn and battered
Iâll meet my match in battle, stay focused, heart and soul blackened
Iâm fucking war torn and battered
