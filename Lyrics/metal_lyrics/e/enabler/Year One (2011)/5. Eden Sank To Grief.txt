Buried in the ashes of the first apocalypse
Worlds collide miles wide, sun blacked out and years go by
Fuel is in our cars and food is on our table
Embrace life with trophies of death, there is nothing fucked here
Iâve gotta live a more righteous lie
Iâll tell my friends that Iâm gonna die
No goodbyes in a fight for survival
No fear in the eyes of those who were bred to die
I can taste life slipping away, drive me into a wall
There is nothing fucked here
