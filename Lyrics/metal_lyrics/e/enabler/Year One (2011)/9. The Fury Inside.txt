I donât know who you think you are, but I know just where youâve been
You pissed on all your friends, you fucking sold them out
Youâre the flavor of the week, you fucking sold us out
Talking shit like itâs going out of style, I will not suffer you
You live with false conviction, youâll fucking sell out
Youâve overstayed your welcome
Donât waste your breath with empty threats
Your blood is mine
You fucking sold us out
We are not a stepping stone for your business plan
Youâll break like glass and wash away like sand
