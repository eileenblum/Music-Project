We have the same agenda but we have different homes
We have the same face but we have different names
Caught up in the selfishness of what is mine and what is yours
Iâve lost myself in throwing a party; letâs celebrate the end of the world
All my friends are here and weâre drunk as fuck
Weâve lost all inhibitions; weâre making love to the air
Weâve lost all hope; there is no reason to care
All emotion is dead and so is everything youâve ever fucking known
Letâs do everything that we never thought we could do
Letâs take a shot for being wiped off the map
Letâs do everything that we never thought we could do
Iâm ready for the moment everything turns black
Itâs an end of the world party and Iâm the one whoâs throwing it
Everythingâs engulfed in flames and I donât give a shit
Weâll all be dead tomorrow
All of the beauty we had was lost
When we gave up our inhibitions and made love to the air
This is the moment we realize how worthless and small we are
These are the last moments that we will spend alive
Iâve drank too much to fuck on my last night on earth
Iâm so pissed at everything that Iâll never do
We knew from our first moment that we were born to fail
Our flaws made us beautiful but they fucked us in the end
