What the fuck are you fighting for, a lost cause in a dying war?
Youâve lost your target, so driven to find a new victim
Someone must always pay, forgiveness will be denied
So consumed by pointing the finger when the finger should be pointed at you
I found a victim, he has no name
Just another face buying into your fucking game
This constant struggle for power â we are at war
If I knew what I was fighting for â Iâd hold the line
