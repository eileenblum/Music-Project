Black Fridayâs burning in the market of hell
Business is booming, my soul is for sale
Consumers are spending their holidays in hell
Liars are preaching the whole worldâs on sale
Black Friday is burning a hole, a hole in our pockets
Celebrate our mortal sin; there is no gift of giving
We are the new pilgrims, we famished the other nations
Satan is spreading his wings forcing cannibalism
Ignite the flames of devastation
Suffer the wrath of hell nation
Liars breathing worm infestation
Satanâs spreading his wings over you
