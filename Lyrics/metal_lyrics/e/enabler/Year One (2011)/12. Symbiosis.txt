It doesnât matter who you are
It doesnât matter what you do
In the end we all fucking lose
Success will not be measured in your financial status
But in how you benefit those who surround you
Weâre all just waiting to be consumed
The earth is patient, we are its food
In the journey to the great beyond your possessions are left behind
To be thrown in Americaâs great pyramids of trash
Burnt alive so fast that the ashes of my past
Disintegrate with the hope of building new life
In the end weâre turned to ashes
To be thrown into the wind
Iâm waiting to be consumed by the sun

âYear Oneâ is a collection containing the album âEden Sank to Griefâ and the EP âWar Begins With Youâ
