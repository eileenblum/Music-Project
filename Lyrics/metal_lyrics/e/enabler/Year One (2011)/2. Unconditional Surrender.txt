My heart rots, a last breath in a plagued existence
My fists lock, a last attempt at negotiation
I canât speak
I canât breathe
I canât sleep
Blood runs cold
Everything turns black
I canât be a martyr without a cause
Our generation wants to see the world burn â no love for anyone
We lack the guts to do it ourselves â so far, move towards the light
Controlled by fear my hate burns cold â this fucking war will never end
No fucking unconditional surrender â hatred forced opposition
Nothing can stop me now
