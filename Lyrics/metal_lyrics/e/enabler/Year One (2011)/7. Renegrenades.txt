No home for the heartless, no love for the lifeless
Donât cry for the suicides, they have made their choice
In the land of the free nothing is fucking free
No jobs for the homeless, just a straight shot to nowhere
Donât cry for the suicides, they have made their choice
In the land of the free nothing is fucking free
In the land of opportunity everyone is fucking lost
I canât stop screaming at these walls, I canât stop screaming before I fall
We think weâre living day by day, weâre fucking dying everyday
I canât stop screaming at these walls, I canât stop screaming before I fall
I wrote these words beyond repair, they taste like bullets of despair
Hope, I gave up; Hate consumes me
Love lost, life lost
Where do I go when every open door leads to nowhere?
All of the doors in this town are locked; all of our dreams are crushed
Thereâs a freight train coming off of its tracks, like a bullet in the night itâs flying
All of the doors in this town are locked; all of our dreams are crushed
