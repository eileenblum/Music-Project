For the liars, for the thieves, for the gluttons, for the cheats
Cut out the tongue of the liar, never will he speak
Never witness the darkness within, conform to infernal lust
Erased from the book of life, deaden the scum of the earth
Lodged in the jaw of the liar, sentenced in frozen seclusion
The lake of fire will freeze, paralyzed with a fire in your eyes, no lies to hide behind
We call on death refuge
For the great betrayer, for destruction of all life, for malicious murderers
We call on death refuge
For the liars, for the thieves, for the gluttons, for the cheats
For the non-believers living at deathâs door
For the fallen angels, we call on death refuge
