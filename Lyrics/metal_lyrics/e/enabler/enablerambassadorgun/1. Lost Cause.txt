Guns blazinâ, there was fire in the sky
The world was coming to an end
If you think that you could front on this, you fucking kid you donât know shit
Trashing yourself and everyone around you, submit to misery
Live fast â die young, work hard â die trying, how will you start again?
Condemn yourself to a living hell, your hatred will prevail
The friends that stay true will see you through
The friends that betray will fade away
One life, one chance â one chance is all you get
One life, one chance â one chance to make things right
I will not contribute to your path of self-destruction
If youâre not willing to save yourself then get the fuck out
Lost cause
