Youâre so naive to believe that you have a voice
Youâre so foolish to think that you can make a difference
Does that mean you should give in? Does that mean you should give up?
You have to stand up for yourself and stay true to what you believe â Black wolf
To all the hate and violence that surrounds us â You canât give in, you canât give in
A lesson in self-control
To the lack of will that this world has â You canât give up, you canât give up
Nothingâs gonna stop you
To all the users who suck the bone dry â Fuck off and die, fuck off and die
Weâre better off without you
Your family and your friends canât be forced to make up for what youâve lost
Your family and your friends are there to lend a helping hand
When everything turns against you, when youâve lost it all
The world will keep on moving with or without you
Hands in the air as an act of defiance
Always on the outside, never looking in; donât believe the lies, never give in
