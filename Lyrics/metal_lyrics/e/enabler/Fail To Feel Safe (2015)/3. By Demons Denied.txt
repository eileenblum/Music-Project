Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Never stop the constant motion
Cannot stop,
There's nowhere to go
There's nothing to do and it's laughing at you

Roll with the punches
Roll with the punches
The dawn will let up when we reach an ocean
The moon will drop staring below
The rife is blue and it's looking at you

Demon

[2x]
Forget the past
Though we can't forgive
There's a hell for me and I'm living in it

[2x]
Fuck this ritual
Daily mass suicide
Demon

Denied

[2x]
Forget the past
Though we can't forgive
There's a hell for me and I'm living in it

Slow death
Rotting masses
Never fail
Never end
Demon speed
Demon seed
Infecting me
Infecting you

[2x and fading]
I'll drive until I reach the gates of hell
Please find me in the place I fell
I'll drive until I reach the gates of hell
I want to tell you that wish you well
