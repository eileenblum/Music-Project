The clouds veiling the sun
a cubic stone in the skies
two brothers work for (the) creation
and only one will survive.

A bastard from the creation,
his mother: the woman incarnation,
his father is the Morning Star.

Injustice back in this earth,
hatred of God made a mark,
banned in skies, (the) sunset dies.

We celebrate your faith,
We celebrate your act, your master way.
Born again and rule,
we're here for you,
this is the Cain's lineage.
Smoke of his sacrifice, ascends!
Smoke of my offering, (is) denied!
His vanity and ignorance, (is) accepted,
my work and wisdom, outside!

Maybe there is no one good,
Maybe there is no one bad,
just two forces fighting for rise.

We celebrate your faith,
We celebrate your master way.
Where are you true God?
Is this justice for you?
here comes the Cain's lineage.
