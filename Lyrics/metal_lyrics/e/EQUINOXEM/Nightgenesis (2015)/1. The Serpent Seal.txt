Through the times of night
Through the ways of lies
Come inside this world
leave the mortal crawl

Walk into this Lodge, starting to know, the Serpent Seal.
and lose it away every mistake, of human race.
Get seasons of light, ages of night, in one stepâ¦
and dissociate the weaknesses, and elevates mankind.

Purify your soul take away your sins.

Serpens sacramentum,
Sigillum,
Ignis et Revelatio,
Sanguis et Victoria,
Solve et Coagula.

See beyond this veil, come and protect, the Serpent Seal.
and trespass the line resting again, in golden chair.
Get reasons for make circles in salt and sulphur squares...

Don't be afraid, to meet the shade that is within.

You're in way to the light,
forgive the Earth, forget all pain.

Sight up to this seal shining on me,
grows inside you, thy serpent incarnates.
