Snowing in the City of Winds,
looking through the glass.
Time is running, in a golden-clock.
Wearing badges and facing the cold.

Growing is the paradigm shift,
unsheathing a flaming sword.
All is shaking, noises are so close
is the fountain and the hidden code.

Can't remember,
why I'm here in the street
With an army,
waiting for my order.

Dark days come
the True Light, fights again.
From this day,
the world will change again.

Is this the oniric state?
Or is real world?
I may wake up now,
or maybe stay asleep for more

Can't remember,
why I'm here in the street
With an army,
waiting for my order.

Dark days come
the True Light, fights again.
From this day,
the world will change again.
