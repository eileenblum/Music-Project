A black halo
over the virgin land,
blurs the wild air
and brings the deepest rain.
Crowning the creation
with the sunset.
It is the end of daylight.

Is the Genesis of Night,
a great door for mind.
With the key that joined to earth,
we can open the Dante's hell.

"The earth was without form, and void.
And darkness, was upon the face of the deep" [Genesis 1:2]

"Do not expect to ever see the sky;
I come to take you to the other side,
the eternal darkness, frost, fire"
[Dante Alighieri]

"At midnight, in the month of June,
I stand beneath the mystic moon." [E.A.Poe]

The light reaches
all his splendour in the dark,
because light
needs the darkness to shine.
Is the anthem of every loneliness.
And is too, the book of dead.
Is the genesis of Night,
a great door for mind.
With the key that joined to earth,
we can open the Dante's hell.

"Above, the gemmed azure is the naked splendor of Nuit." [AL 1:14]

"I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset;
I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky." [AL 1:66]

"I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice." [AL 1:58]

"Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will." [AL 1:57]

Is the genesis of Night,
a great door for mind.
With the key that joined to earth,
we can open the Dante's hell.

Tenebris surgit!
Noctem in secula!

Tenebris surgit!
Noctem in secula!
Tenebris vincit,
et lux superatus est!
