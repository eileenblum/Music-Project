Tenebris surgit!
Noctem in secula!
Tenebris vincit,
et lux superatus est!

The agony of the Sun
in the hands of Chaos.

Erebus,
ruling from the dark
silence of the West.
Filling all the spaces
with shadows and fog.

Under the bright blue night
the Order of Gaia comes with
chants for the fourth winds
to achieve the central beam.
The triumph of the serpent
beyond the holy's trap.

Erebus,
making all the stars
tempest in the skies.
Protecting all the creatures
with shadows and fog.

Attracts the sound of discord.
And will become feared,
and will be honored forever,
loved by the left handed path.

Erebus chao!
Erebus chao!
Erebus chao!

Tenebris surgit!
Noctem in secula!
Tenebris vincit,
et lux superatus est!
