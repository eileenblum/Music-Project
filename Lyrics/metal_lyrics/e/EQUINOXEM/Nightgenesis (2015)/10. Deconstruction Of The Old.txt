Into the enlightenment,
when the structure moves.
The old ideas
change to new forms.

And the end will be
always the question,
because in doubt lies

the path to certainty.

In a new dawn of mind,
even covered
by the darkest night,
with the fire
that is in your heart
begin to deconstruct the old.

To understand
all that was forbidden.

See how the vanity
can defeat even
the wisest king.

And take the tools
to start the adventure
that makes you
truly authentic and new.

In a new dawn of mind,
even covered
by the darkest night,
with the fire
that is in your heart
begin to deconstruct the old.
