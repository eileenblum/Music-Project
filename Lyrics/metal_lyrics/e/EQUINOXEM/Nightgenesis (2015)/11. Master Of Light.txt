In darkness eyes, the light begins...

Banished from Heaven,
prince of the rebels.
A hated warrior
by blasphemy of wisdom.

The Bearer falls, his flame for us...
The Archangel
The Rebel
Great Master of Light!

Oh! quiÃ©n eres tÃº?
precioso Ser...
que has caÃ­do aquÃ­...

Oh! dÃ©jame ver...
quÃ© hay en tÃ­..
es la Noche y su Luz...

Falling through times
all seasons left behind.
Believe in the true path

against the blinded mass .

The Bearer falls, his flame for us...
The Archangel
The Rebel
Great Master of Light!

Now I'm here! remember me!
in the Kairos and the Chaos!
You're a God like me,
a masterpiece of freedom.

Y con mi canciÃ³n
te ayudarÃ©...
a despertar el Ser...

I decline my immortal side,
to bring (the) fire for all mankind!

The Bearer falls, his flame for us...
The Archangel
The Rebel
Great Master of Light!
