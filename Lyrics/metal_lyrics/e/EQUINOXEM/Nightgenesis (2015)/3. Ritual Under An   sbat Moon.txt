Dance, under an Ãsbat moon,
my eyes shine for your beauty light, silent Lady.

Sing again like brothers in faith,
free your mind and spills your blood to be.

Into this coven
I am walk with the spirits of nature.
An old rite, contacts with the Goddess.

Drinking and sharing
the eternal chalice,
an Elected of Nine,
in a real sacred act.

The center of a unique circle,
and a sleeping sun in peace, a ritual under an Ãsbat moon.

Queen in his quiet throne,
Bless the seas with your beauty light, silent Lady.

From neophytes to immortals,
joined in love with flesh and fly tonight.

A pentagram written into earth,
lesser banishing, that calls
for the risen.

Know all the Demons
that chokes the air,
dance with the angels of night.

The center of a unique circle,
the Two transmutes in One, a ritual under an Ãsbat moon.
