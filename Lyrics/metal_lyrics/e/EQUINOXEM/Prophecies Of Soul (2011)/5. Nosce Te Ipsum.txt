Welcome to my dark abyss.
Come here,
if you want to find me.

Your mind is the place
between the earth and the sky,
where (you) find all you need,
where (you) fly to be free.

No religion here, only eternity.

Noscete Ipsum,
and (you) will know the universe
and the gods.

You are in my dark abyss.
All the knowledge
inside you.

Inside you a universe
waiting to be discovered,
and give the powers
hidden for centuries.

No religion here, only eternity

Noscete Ipsum...

The power born,
the mighty comes,
the force in you

Noscete Ipsum...
Noscete Ipsum...
