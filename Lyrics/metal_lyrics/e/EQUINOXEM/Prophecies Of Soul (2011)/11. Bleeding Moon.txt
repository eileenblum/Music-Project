I can see the Moon crawling blood,
it's the time to live inside this power.

Your hands can touch
this endless time,
your soul... is transformed.

The Sun turns to darkness,
and (the) Moon turns to blood

Before great day arrives,
before great time comes.
And will die...

Bleeding Moon,
in the sky appears
Oh, Bleeding Moon

It's the end of this time,
think and fight for your life.

In prophecies the Moon
crawling blood,
and the Earth absorves
(the) anger of gods

Your eyes can see this endless time,
your soul... is transformed.

The sun turns to darkness...
Before great day arrives...

Bleeding Moon...

In the end, of the Nine,
born and die, to survive.
