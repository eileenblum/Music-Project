I wanted to make a perfect world.
I tried to be a loved one.
Once I built illusions
in an unreal place.
I wasted my time
trusting in wrong ones.

Always we want peace and love
in a world of wars and pain.

The Life's Book has a dark chapter
about hypocrisy and love.

The yellow pages of experience
are wisdom for you
and these sad words
will be your sword.

Destroyed pages of fellowship
and confused trust.
Nobody can be saved,
unless (they) want to be saved.

The dark side of my loved ones
a shadow in my mind,
an unpredictable song
with anger notes
and sorrow chords.

Maybe I need to stay alone
one more time before the dawn.

Maybe I will stay alone
always after the storm.
