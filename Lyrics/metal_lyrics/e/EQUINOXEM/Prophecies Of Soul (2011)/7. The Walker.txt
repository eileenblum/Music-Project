Here I am,
stopped in the start of the road
with my travel-bag of wishes.

My ancient memory of feats,
that in other lives happened,
today will be my faith.

A long road
draws in front of me,
surrounded by holes and trees.

The sky guides my path,
a soul like compass,
destiny comes.

I belive in my force,
to reach the end,
and the victory of wishes,
that rules again.

Before I should
travel through,
learn with proofs
and wisdom.

I begin the road,
there will be heat and cold,
but I never will stop
