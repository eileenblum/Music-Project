The Earth changes,
transforms the Heaven
in a darkness landscape
drawing a weak Sun in an old page.

A cold call, soul under this arcane sky:
The shattering of the warmth.

Equinox, transition of Sun
Lament of the autumn

Behold and feel
everything is falling here:
souls fly
and the look (at) all the ache

Golden leaves, in a damned path.
Bringing the cold to your soul
Fall of Sun,
again and again... forever.

Enter and quest,
the real meaning of night,
while stars advance,
breathe the dusk
and moonlight.

From West to North
from North to Orient,
from Orient to South.

In the zodiac an ecliptic,
motion of Sun.
