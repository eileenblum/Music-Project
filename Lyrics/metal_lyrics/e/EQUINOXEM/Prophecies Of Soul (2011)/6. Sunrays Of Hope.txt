Sunrays of hope,
enter in this ancient
virtuous place,
making a grey afternoon
in past images.

Times of tranquility,
Times of reflection,
Times of change,
Times of remember.

Melancholy angels,
receives the rain
in this cold stone temple.
Where time does not pass,
and oblivion comes.

Times of tranquility,
Times of reflection,
Times of change,
Times of remember.

The ominous clouds,
run through the sky
while sunrays of hope
trespass the cenital
playground of time.
