Awakening for a dream,
History becomes a fake.

All that was evil is good,
all that was good is evil.
Oldest cities want peace
and mystic woods to think.

The dawn-bearer says:
"You want light or truth?"

Sorry for you, innocent one,
reality sometimes is not like in books.
Another vision about mankind
a new beginning of thoughts.

In cosmovision tales,
Creators are the writers.

Oh Morningstar!
Inside you, the key!

The hang-man got
an upside vision of all;
a new perception of forms.
Inside this prophecies of soul
to find your own truth in tale.

"Because truth comes with light,
but light not always with truth"

Transmute
the seed in gold,
and gold in light,
and light in truth.
