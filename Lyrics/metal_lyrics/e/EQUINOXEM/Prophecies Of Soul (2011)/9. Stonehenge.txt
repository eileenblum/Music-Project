A tale of the Arcane age,
Druids walk and fly
through the wisdom of time.
His beauty robe and magic hands,
with old books and new ways.

Bring your blood,
to the sacrifice stone.

Mighty power from Nature,
comes to celebrate this gathering,
and a blue-silver light
embrace the stone circle.
To reborn your own self.

Hear...
the sound of myth creatures.
Hear...
the power of Earth.
The apprentice has left his corner;
all the skills live in his mind.

Hear...
the sound of myth creatures.
The Order of Gaia awakens.
Nature and Gods wait for the illumination,
under this Solstice night.

Masters beyond all times
prophets of future insight!
