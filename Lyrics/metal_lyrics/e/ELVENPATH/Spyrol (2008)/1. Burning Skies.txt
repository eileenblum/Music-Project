In the dead of the night the sirens they cried 
Waking up the world for the deadly sight 
What happened in the darkness calm 
They said that the air had turned to deathÂs lair 
Two giant eagles without a care 
Now watch out for the oncoming storm 

The seven plagues came raining down, there was no place to flee 
In darkest pain I watched my brother die 
My family lay in their blood, pure horror I did see 
The terror that came out of the sky 

Beneath burning skies weÂre running for our lives 
Never will our days be the same 
When flashes light the sky man and child will die 
Watch out Â the skies are aflame 

What happened there high up in the air 
No one could tell in their voice of despair 
When the eagles had met in the night 
Death to our world, they brought pain and hurt 
Masters of evil by hellish winds stirred 
What an unbearable sight 

When the darkness of the night burned bright as the sun 
Mercilessly death knocked on our door 
Among the ruins I now stand, the last remaining one 
The wound will pierce my heart forevermore 

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Till OberboÃel]
