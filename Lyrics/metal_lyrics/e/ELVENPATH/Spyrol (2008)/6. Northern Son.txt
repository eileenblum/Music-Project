The saddest day for all the world came in the Moon of Mead 
When the heart of NordlandÂs ever greatest son did cease to beat 
The hordes gathered throughout the lands, fell to their knees in grief 
And cried a thousand tears in agony and disbelief 

Oh bitter came the mourning times, the sun gives no more light 
For one who meant the world to me has passed into the night 
So hordes of warriors in the world, this requiem be sung 
For NordlandÂs greatest warrior that died so very young 

Forever be thy name remembered far and wide 
The thirteen candles burn for you like for all those who died 
The hall up high may welcome you, through blood by thunder ride 
And on your quest for timeless life Valkyries be your guide 

A burning ship of lifeless glory, to nowhere it must sail 
I raise the horn and drink to thee, loud be called out thy hail 
And though we know that life canÂt last, all men must die the same 
I know one thing which never dies, the honour of thy name 

ValhallaÂs gates now open wide for northern son 
Now sits by the side of fathers long time gone 
Called way up high by gods of thunder, wind and rain 
You are in our hearts and ever will remain 

The blood on ice is frozen in the home of those once brave 
Under the runes the wheel of sun, a call from out (of) the grave 
The wind of mayhem brings on day of wrath the dragonÂs breath 
The reaper sings an ode of war and blood and fire and death 

When blood and soul on VinlandÂs blooded shore have turned to grey 
By the lake of fire the mournerÂs clad in black in Asa Bay 
And bearers of a hammerheart know when this world is gone 
After his death theyÂll see the resurrection of the northern son 

And wherever I may ride I know youÂre always there 
And in the thick of fray and fight I know youÂre always there 
Into the dark the hammerheart shall send a shining light 
So let this song of hail to you ring loud into the night 

ValhallaÂs gates now open wide for northern son 
Now sits by the side of fathers long time gone 
Forever in my heart your spirit will remain 
And in the hall of fallen ones weÂll meet again 

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Till OberboÃel]
