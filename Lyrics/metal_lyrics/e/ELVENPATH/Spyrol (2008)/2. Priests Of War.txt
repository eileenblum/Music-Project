A holy war is what youÂd fight, youÂd be the chosen one 
Bringing peace to all the lands, but all I see is misery now 
Who do you think that you are, a man or man made god 
Deaf to all the words of warning, treachery works always somehow 

Down glory road you rode in triumph in the name of liberty 
You came to bring them peace and life and free these lands from all their sorrow 
Fires burning to the sky, the monuments you gave the land 
And if its children die today their fathers will love you tomorrow 

And you can never feel a thing so far away 
And you will never see until your dying day 

Priests of war Â tell me what is it for 
For peace we yearned, you never learned 
And now the fires of hate grow evermore 
Priests of war Â the black oath has been sworn 
And in the darkest clouds of night 
I see your death be born 

How do you now sleep these days, how do you dream at night 
Do you ever feel remorse for all the lies that you were telling 
Not too long we will be waiting, not too long your reign will last 
One of these days youÂll be pleased to meet the Coalition of the Killing 

DonÂt you know things in life ainÂt always what they seem 
Your victimsÂ funeral march shall be your dying scream 

It matters not where youÂll be hiding 
It matters not how long weÂll search 
The price will be paid 
YouÂll pay with your hollow soul 

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Till OberboÃel]
