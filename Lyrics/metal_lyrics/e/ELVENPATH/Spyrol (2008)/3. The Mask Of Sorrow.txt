Again the sun has risen and another day is born
To you it doesnÂt matter, all hope is long forlorn
For you there is no life outside these four white walls
So spend all of your days decaying in your husbandÂs halls

So you hide Â for the veil of black conceals your eyes
Behind the mask of sorrow nobody sees your face
Every day and every night abandoned from the light
Wear the mask of sorrow till the end of your days

The days go by like years, you lost count long ago
A life within a world that nobody must know
A sacrifice fed to the beasts, contempt in every word
YouÂve told your god a hundred times but has he ever heard

Sometimes when night has fallen you think of that day
When you canÂt take it any more and you will run away
DonÂt you know thereÂs no way you ever will be free
You will be found and killed for the honour of your family
So better close your eyes and keep this dream a dream

So you hide behind the mask of sorrow
So you hide beneath the veil of black
