The town is a peaceful place down by the sea 
No strife has been known for the past century 
Now the children are hungry and homeless again 
And a way to escapeÂs out of sight 

High above the place where the young ones must bleed 
A castle of ancient stands without defeat 
Its walls keep a fearless warrior queen 
Her heart lives, her soul breathes for the fight 

Her hair born of flames, her heart forged of fire 
Avenger of dark souls in need 
Till time takes her life sheÂll challenge the gods 
And keep fighting for those who believe 

Angel of fire, warrior of light 
Challenge her power and sword if you dare 
Angel of fire forever will fight 
Death awaits those who step into her lair 

For years and for centuries the legions of night 
They besieged the castle, tried to steal the light 
They brought fear and darkness to land, air and sea 
But never could take down the walls 
Where so long ago ancient free tribes did dwell 
Shall never be turned into slavedriverÂs hell 
The angel of fire in her ragged armour 
Forever will reign in these halls 

With hair born of flames and heart forged of fire 
SheÂll wield her sword for the forlorn 
Until the day salvation comes to these lands 
And justice anew will be born 

The story is told and the time has passed long 
What remains is glory of tale and of song 
The warrior queen has been laid to her grave 
And honour and truth now prevail 
The castle of seafaring heroes still stands 
To tell of the heroine and guard well the lands 
And should the great shadow of fear rise again 
Our firequeen again we will hail 

When children are crying in hunger and fear 
And four horsemen pillage the land 
With hair born of flames and heart forged of fire 
The swordwielding angel will stand 

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Till OberboÃel]
