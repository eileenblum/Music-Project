Your mother lies silently dyingBut you cannot stay with her nowListen son to what IÂve told youThe one choice you have is to goMorgan of Orris is waitingBy treason the heir to the throneThe fate of a world that is tremblingIs placed now in your hands alone Close your eyes and take a journey to the other sideIn the shadows walk and from the claws of darkness hide Ride on across the lands of hateThe queen lies dying in painSave the world from the evil oneGo and find the sacred talisman The setting sun it keeps your secretBe it true or just fantasyThe isle of dark nightmares awaits youChallenging black forces unseen Never let them take your strength and hold your head up highAnd youÂll be crowned victorious when darknessÂ fall is nigh Darkest fears and unknown horrors they will pave your wayOur homes and heartlands in the shadows of decayTerritories of beyond shall not fall prey to sinAnd weÂll see beloved queen Laura reign in light again
