In the east where the sun would riseI know a country in disguiseCanÂt speak your word, canÂt breathe without fearFor every minute death is nearFor 20 years theyÂve been fighting so hardFighting for justice, to live by their heartsWhen the army of darkness cameTo bring them hatredÂs burning flame Clouds of hate blacken the skyHereÂs no sun to watch them dieDeath and terror for the freeIn the land that could not be Forbidden soil that must not existA million hands turning into fistsForever theyÂll fight for their honour and landA million graves in the sandWhat will you do if they carry onThey will come to you next after this land is goneA hungry monster with greed for guiltUntil the last drop of blood is spilt Tell me how much longer will it takeUntil they can see the lightStill the world watches onHow much longer will they have to fight
