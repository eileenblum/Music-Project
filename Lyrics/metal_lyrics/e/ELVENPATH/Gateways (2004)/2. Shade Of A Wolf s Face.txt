He is following the path over mountains
His fellowÂs with him and theyÂre following the sun
Their aim is not to walk just that straight on
Enjoying that time and everything around

Ordinary life Â it seems to him
Like tunnel vision
Is it so hard to live right now
The two were about to find the answer

In slow motion and in silence
There is nothing to lose
He said: fellow shouldnÂt we hurry
To get no sense of passing by the days

Whatever may come we donÂt know if thereÂs one
Life after this one on earth
May someone have been and really have seen
ItÂs hard to believe in a world in Âthe beyondÂ
What I have seen is nothing else but my life
And I have been only on this one side
I know thereÂs no chance to live again
There is no chance to turn back time

HeÂs looking at the clouds up in the sky
Animating fantasies while they are passing by
Some animals laugh and some seem scary
The clouds on these photos he is watching now

Have the shape of the face of a wolf

Watching the photos itÂs so hard lo believe
But this is pure reality
These photos are the last of his friend
He had followed this beautiful sunset

And got where he couldnÂt get back

Whatever may come we donÂt know if thereÂs one
Life after this one on earth
May someone have been and really have seen
ItÂs hard to believe in a world in Âthe beyondÂ
What he has seen is nothing else but his life
And he has been only on this one side
He knows thereÂs no chance to live again
There is no chance to turn back time
