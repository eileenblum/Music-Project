The snow is falling, covering the landA world in white that makes my heart freezeThere'll be no thaw today, there hasn't been for yearsI wonder if the cold will ever cease There's no one in the streets, no smiling faceThe ice has conquered all the heartsAs long as I remember there's never been no greenThe season has been winter from the start Eternal darkness that nothing can destroyIn this cruel winterlandThere's no love here, no freedom and no joyIn this evil winterland I've heard a legend that there could be a sunThough I have never felt her shine on my headA world of endless snowfall, this place is hellMen with zombie brains - the living dead I can't bear this agony any moreBut I'm tied to this land of iceMy chains are icy steel, the frost is in my bloodAnd I can feel my strength's demise I can't take it any longerGathering all that's left inside meAnd I take my fate in my own hands Tonight I'm gonna break my chainsI bid farewell to all of thisTonight I will escape from winterland
