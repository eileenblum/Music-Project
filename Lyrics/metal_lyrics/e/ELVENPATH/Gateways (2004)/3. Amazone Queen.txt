Figures of darkness, eternal nightRuling this land, no sanctuary to findRaping and killing, a murderous gameLegions of evil that no man can tameThis land knows no freedom, this land knows no peaceJust hunger and poverty, crime and diseasePraying for a saviour, they got no more powerAs they kneel crying before the dark tower Hooves sound like thunder, call for salvationA voice of steel rings out for liberation Over the mountains and down to the seaThe warrior princess ridesFighting for glory, her heartland to freeEyes of light, steel at her sideAmazone queen, no trace of fearFace the evil, fight till death and freedom will be hereAmazone queen, before thee we kneelPraise the bravest warrior ever seen She gathers her warriors, she stands tall with prideDraws now her sword, it is shimmering with lightRaises it high up into the airHer pounding battlecryÂs heard everywhereThe battle is raging, the stars they turn blackThey who once were slaves now lead the attackBreaking their chains and their tyrantÂs dethronedThe mighty dark tower crumbling stone by stone The warrior princess led us out of miseryThe land is freed, gone are the days of slaveryAmazone warrior, princess we hail theeEnthroned in triumph, crowned to be our queen
