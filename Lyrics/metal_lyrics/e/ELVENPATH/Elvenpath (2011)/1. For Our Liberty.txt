In the western forests, by the endless seaSurrounded by forces of the enemyLegions of the twilight had come to take their landYet all those tales of conquest were written in sand Celtic warriors gather, watch the cauldron boilDrink the magic potion, defend your native soil Fight for your heartland side by sideInto darkness you will rideTaunt the wrath of gods and set it freeFists in the air we will resistLegions lost in Gallic mistStand together for our liberty Ancient mighty druid, wisest of the wiseKeep the secret safer than your own true eyesSmallest of all warriors, take them on aloneStrongest of all warriors, carve our deeds in stone Not a single one of the invaders shall withstandThose who dare to march ashore will feel our iron hand See the iron walls around their villageYet they never would enter the realm of fearRaise your standards, fly the Roman eagleHope is most likely born when the end is near
