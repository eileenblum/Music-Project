No light in the darkness, weÃ¢ÂÂve opened the gateNo chance to turn back, itÃ¢ÂÂs far too lateOnward through blackness where eyes cannot seeThe ancient realm of the dwarves entered we Magic still lives where they carved for the goldCaves long forgotten yet great to beholdThe silence and dark fills our hearts full of gloomWelcome to the ancient realm of Khazad-DÃÂ»m Of these halls the bards still singBalin, dwarflord, mountain kingOnce filled with life, now theyÃ¢ÂÂre all goneYet the spirits of Moria still live on Moria Ã¢ÂÂ with fearful eyes behold its gatesMoria Ã¢ÂÂ behind the light the dark awaitsMoria Ã¢ÂÂ where Lugburz prepares for attackMoria Ã¢ÂÂ on the bridge thereÃ¢ÂÂs no turning back In the Chamber of Records we found BalinÃ¢ÂÂs tombThe mountain king stood brave until he met his doomThen silence was broken by drums in the deepAnd evil beyond measure awoke from its sleep Hunted by the demons of fire and painWe fled through the halls that gave darkness its nameUntil there was no way out and Mithrandir fellBeneath the great mountain just a taste of hell In brightest light the sun burns redWeÃ¢ÂÂd leave our dear friend there for deadEscaped from the darkness, our hearts in despairOur hope vanished in the fire demonÃ¢ÂÂs lair
