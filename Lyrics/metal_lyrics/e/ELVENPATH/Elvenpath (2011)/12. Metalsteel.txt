Heavy Metal is our church and Judas is our priest
We love Heavy Metal and we live it like a beast
We wear Heavy Metal shirts and Heavy Metal trousers
We live Heavy Metal in our Heavy Metal houses
Heavy Metal life 24 Heavy Metal hours
Heavy Metal bathrooms with Heavy Metal showers
We live Heavy Metal every day till the sun sets
When night has fallen we sleep in our Heavy Metal beds

Metalsteel

Here in Heavy Metal land we live for Heavy Metal
Eat steel and shit Metal like our Heavy Metal cattle
Heavy Metal valleys and Heavy Metal mountains
Molten Heavy Metal springs from Heavy Metal fountains
Heavy Metal armies and Heavy Metal forces
Heavy Metal cows and Heavy Metal horses
Heavy Metal is the truth and Heavy MetalÃ¢ÂÂs real
Heavy Metal Metal and Heavy Metal steel
