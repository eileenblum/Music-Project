I live my dream, my guitar is a time machineA magic journey to the land of the freeI start to play, Heavy Metal is the only way To fly into the dream again Run to the iron hills Where the eagles fly freeFly like the Icarus From here to eternity One - mighty bass from hellTwo - feel the drum machineThree - guitars start to screamFour - hear the voice of steel I'm running free, I am back in the 70'sTo see the birth of the iron priestThe rise of British steel, Metal god and scream machinePurple smoke on the water I see See the rainbow eyes A light in the black behindFrom the dark star cameThe master of reality The beast of steel brings me back to the 80'sThe kings of Metal await meIn the mighty hall of the steel and mountain king I hear the call of the Metal gods Sign of the hammer soulHail and kill, man of war we callBack into the future nowFollow the path of the elves
