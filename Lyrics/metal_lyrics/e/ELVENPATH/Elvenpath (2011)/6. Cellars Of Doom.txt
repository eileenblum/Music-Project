My heritage of wilderness, my legacy of god
Gathering rage and then it explodes
What shall be will be
What weÃ¢ÂÂll be youÃ¢ÂÂll see

Kept in the cellars of doom my friend
Tonight I will take revenge for myself
Kept in the cellars of doom my friend
Forever and ever and thereÃ¢ÂÂs no way turning back

The angel on my shoulder is gone
(And) the devil combines their powers in one
And he grins and he laughs because of your pain
ItÃ¢ÂÂs too late, all your prayers are now in vain
