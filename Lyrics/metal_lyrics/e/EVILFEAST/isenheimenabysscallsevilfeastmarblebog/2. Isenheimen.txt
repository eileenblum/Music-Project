In search for a mental homeland
Far beyond their comprehension
As the first snow falls
I will leave again to dwell in the dark
The vision appears on the glacial surface
In the grim kingdom are built
The palaces of ice among the stone giants
A call beyond thy free will
All the land shall be the winter field
With the faces white and souls black
Then I`ll defend my stronghold of aryan heart
Deep in the woods I`m in equilibrium
At last in the sphere where the filth won`t reach me
Year by year I build there my tower
Of mystic visions and thundering hatred
I cast the wrath unto horizon
Embraces by mist, covered with snow
A vastland descendant, desolate wanderer
And as the land becomes the winter field
Due to one word of the might
The feeble cries, a last sigh is made
Through they die as it beckons
I entrench myself within the walls
To fare, then to reign
And share the sceptre with the forest
The one who outlast the seizure
That came from the pit boiling dirt
A single banner reaises high above
Of annually recurred attempt
The frost recedes the questions
To manage to glance
Upon the wintry landscape below
There kies my kingdom...
