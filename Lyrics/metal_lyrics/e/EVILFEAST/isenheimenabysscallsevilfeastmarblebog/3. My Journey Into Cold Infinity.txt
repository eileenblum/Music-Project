,,...onse again I climb...
the phenomenal dimension left beneath...
the mountains that bear the wisdom...
and the forests, and the lake, and the stars that joined...
singing their song while I begin my last journey...
a glance into the essence..
the time attempts to close its circle...
still no distance between the beginning and the end...
in the cold where no life nor death exists, all is finally done...
me...
and infinity..."
