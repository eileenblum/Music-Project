Above the crest a whirlwind blows again with fury
The crag monument appears in its dark magnificence
Clouds ablaze trying to bridle the space, a single being amidst
I've gone hunting anew to seize the highland spirit
Across the spheres where the streams' ribbons attempt to break the resistance
Unholy forests ascend vanishing before they reach the clouds
A genuine realm of dusk shall be my realm this night
When I'm breathing the frozen wind that descended throughout the Tatra pass
Where no weak endures and the immensity is appalling, I'll be conquering...
The filth always flows down, in a distant valleys it settles
Hateful for they exhibit what's pure for trades
As I clamber isolation rises, sacred dearest solitude is thy end
Though the scum still pester... Nighttime journey
Achieves monumental deeds in a stone freezing interior
As the wolves come out hunting towards the sullen landscape
The mild hide before deceptive moonlight
The old sprits revive, the past returns, the purity of a winter kingdom
That is still left as a primeaval splendour of the fatherland
On a mountainside I observe clouds on a nightsky torn by
Carpathian winder wind. With wolves I'll share my throne...
