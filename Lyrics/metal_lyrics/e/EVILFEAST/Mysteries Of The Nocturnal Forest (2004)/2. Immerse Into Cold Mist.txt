Dawn of time as I began my journey
The fullmoon seem to be this night
The forest was silent and clear
And no signs were bearing witness
That the storm will come to possess me
To walk apparently with no deeper meaning
At the end return to my old sanity
And ignorant imprisonment
Hammered by own limitations
This dawn found me weak
Devoid of hatred in heart
As a weapon against an effigy
Of his earthly hosts
Causing their decease in flames of wrath
I felt the first signs of it
As I immersed into cold mist
And distant visions
Were scarcely loomed
But on the horizon the dark ominous
Clouds slowly gathered
Mighty mother foretells
Of conquering the new throne
Shallow spell which will
Develop into persistent shapes
Has pushed my will there whence
It could not return filthy
Within the ideas of lightâ¦
