After a great encounter
Where triumphant glory meant
To cast off the ashes
Of pathetic old non-ideas
And to stand solitarily
On a snow field that became a place
Of falling the dark might upon
Guided to the verge of solitude
They disappeared then
And I stand before the immensity
That took my breath
As the rays of fullmoon would reveal
That I crossed the boundary
Divine consciousness
Evidently in evilâs sense
Has conquered my heart
Iâll fill the emptiness
With fulfillment of my feelingsâ depth
And the true emptiness which
Used to appear the essence
Will remain so far, far
So I stand there when the wood
Seemed to open its gates
In a stack of offals
Of those Iâve rejected
And what now diverged
In a crystalline majestic cold
Of this great hateful sanctity
And I reached the conscience
Of a victory in the glorious night
And I could behold the black heavens
That opened before meâ¦
