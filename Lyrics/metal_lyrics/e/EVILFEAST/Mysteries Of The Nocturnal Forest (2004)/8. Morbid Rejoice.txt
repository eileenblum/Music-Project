So the mighty space closed
And returned the old woodsâ vision
Plain magic ended
However it remained in spirit
As strong as in transfiguration moments
Cause I saw it with another eye
Reception shallowness retreated
It became my flesh
A dark force which has made me its son
Distant from the rest of herd
Cannot submit to their craft
Cannot bear their compassion
Nothing in common with false humility
Not considering myself a god
Although my hatred is above me and it is pure
My visions run to dead pyres of carrion
Ruined monuments of pathetic life
Crosses shattered to splinters
And this what they builded for cons
Taking themselves for a tending to perfection
Truly plunged into swamps
Lacerated and torn to pieces
I walked out of the wood calmly
On my old snowy path
The trees have been bowing
I walked out different into old enclosure
And I know that Iâll always be returning
When the sun smothered at sunset
When the moon in silvery cold is rising
So I arose in might
With no fear into death no fear into torment
And when Iâll drown in solitude
It shall give me eternal peaceâ¦
