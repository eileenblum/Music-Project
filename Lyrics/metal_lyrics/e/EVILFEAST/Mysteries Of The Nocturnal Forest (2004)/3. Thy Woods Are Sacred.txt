As the shadows were rising
First steps on a path of glory
Confident in my might.  I entered
The path is the only one
Iâm beholding around me
The spirits of trees are observing
This being is at the bound
Which itâll cross before dawn
I realized that Iâm on the clearing
Darker than I could imagine
And the oaken throne has been revealed
With spiritual evil force on it
Thy woodlord knows
How is to dwell into spheres
Of sorrow and evil
There is darkening on my path
The mist is descending from the mountains
And the creations are gradually leaving
Their abodes in depths of this old soil
Theyâve prepared thy rite
Which will release the blasphemer
Instead of trodden heart
Forth coming storm
It cannot retire nowâ¦
