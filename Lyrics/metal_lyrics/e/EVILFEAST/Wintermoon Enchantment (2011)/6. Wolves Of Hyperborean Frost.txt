Among the silence where the woods freeze
The skies remain grim to rejoice the winter wolves
That came from beyond the misty hills
Approached to gather at the immaculate soil
I am of them to obliterate the God's traces
I am of them to disavow the son thrice
I am of them to suffocate the spirit with hatred
I am of them to mock those raped by the luminous realm
Mountains - the calm witness to these
Conjuring and transcending rites
My face adorned with the hoarfrost
Atop the mount unapproachable plateau
Glance upon the grey locust
That drowned their innate pride
Into the mud of idolatry
Out of reach of the failure monuments sight
casting the stones in powerless incomprehensibility
I watch them hovering beneath our feet
Stand as a part of the limited circle
In the sphere I climbed once
Conquering the steps gropingly then aware
Filth nest I've left by my will as so few dared before
Over those of torn off knees and shattered brows
Forlorn attempts to reach beyond
From the grotesque usurper's blessed void
Distinguish the worms creeping in wolf masks
And drag them back into their divine swamp
And then amidst the silent woods
I shall intone the heretic chant...
