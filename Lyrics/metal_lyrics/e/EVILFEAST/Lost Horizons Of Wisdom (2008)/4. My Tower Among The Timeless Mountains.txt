Again I took a glance at the opposite chine
Where abdicating sun left its last sigh of agony
The shivering response at the lunar kingdom
The malediction to unfold myself
From the highest tower I submerge into pondering
To penetrate behind the facade
Where the monstrosity arose in immemorial ages
Strewed into soil of the incapacity conscience
Adorned with the garment of clods pretending gems
A custom hoisted to the absurd level
Of platitudes anyhow obscure
I stir the mountain storm to heavenly dissidence
An overthrowing winds of defiance to the usurpation
Since internal repugnant antilogy
Revealed between each of chain units
I depart to the earthworms' bottom
To behold the swarm rising the temples
The fear altars to praise the lord of craft destructive
Beseech not to tread while wandering
A response to ascending withdraw
Into darker evilness chapel
As the journeys turn oddly mystical
Either I become the old forgotten tale
Spoken silently by the distant winds
In the mist-coated autumn dusk
