The skyline wide expanded awaiting the rite of entering
Involving the mightiest force to absorb the particle
Heralded by the obtoe-angular great mouth of immensity
The single ego imbibes into universe dark
Far north, the throbbing lights
A demister as resting on the meridian
Of the pillars that maintain the infinity
As far as the perceptions capacity reaches
The AlgolÂ¡Â¯s half-range still stands beyond
Yet the light may blacken as the icicle may scald
Something our breadth of glance makes inaccessible
There, a thousands of platonian things themselves
Or just a dimension of inconceivable notions
The spheres where I fulfill the Wesensschau
Lurking to swallow the universe
Or a nominalism enchanted
Within threefold dialectical comprehension
As I enter the northern astral kingdom
My soul becomes the mirror that reflects the worldÂ¡Â¯s entrails.
