The cage is grimly cold yet in the space of purity
Hidden in mine forestland desolate
Sink thy mind's eye seizing the width
Vast fount of time, swallow thine source
Drowning in the aeons grasp
I recede far into endless fields
Alas no present shall indemnify
What each moment deprives from yesteryears
They darken of the oblivion's dust
Fixed to the walls at the reality's bound
Beware of entering the dark realm
As there the inmost hatred reigns
Attachment of life restrained to vanity
These chilling halls testify the ravaged soul
I summon the old wolves
To captivate my affectable sphere
The night evokes hunger
As the consuming force emerges from the mist
The sorrow and wrath intertwined to ill sign
Announcing the funeral of hope for the weak
I've made me a cell of singular force
To haunt with the beloved negative gale
