I don't dwell here despite the apparent dwelling
Truly in dense malevolent abode
Feeling the presence's as inhaling effluvium
So I left the pit years ago
To regain at the sanctified zone
Far beyond the domain of human stench
I obtained the keys to the gate of great mystery
The forest kingdom now extends before my sight
A vertical hierarchy impersonates the rising might
From the carpet of floral dunnage that invites my feet
To the skies growing grey with sinister clouds
Veiling the timid rays of luminosity
Midway appears the main thickness
Of my old wooden companions
Let the woods reject due to proceeding fall
The lonely wanderer
