Touch me
With your lies
It makes you taller
But in the eyes
Of those desiring truth
You seem so small

You've got your desperate measures and old extortions
Got to change yourself to please every person
Got your wasted nights with scenes forgotten
Got you days of drama, but you don't stop them

Because
You like to think that you're special
It makes you feel better that you're alive
I am tearing apart these feelings
That are making me lose my head
For the ones that cause all these feelings
Like the whore that's in my bed
With conversational drama
The words that get in my head
Got to tear down all of these feelings
With the darkness turning red
I'm tired of waiting for healing
By the remedies in my hand
With everyone intervening

Well everything that I am
I have only you to blame
Say it takes time to adjust
But it still all looks the same
Your ship is sinking fast
You should go down with it too
The water's going deep
Realize it's all because of you
