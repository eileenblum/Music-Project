I'm sorry that I left you marooned
On this planet that looks so blue
My name is spoken and you'll forget
Here the sun rises and never sets

I draw the lines between the stars
And watch them bleed as empty scars
There's no one left so who's to blame
I'm numb to all but I feel the same
Because faith and hope have left this place
Encompassing in empty space

I pray to space
And everything is so far away

Once you find one to react
You never quite seem to get yourself back
Once you find one to react
You never quite seem to get unattached
Once you find one to react
You never quite seem to take it all back
Once you find one to react

Everyone I love will suffocate
Because I couldn't just be honest with me
Everyone I love will suffocate
And now the truth is in my face
