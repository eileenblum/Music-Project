He's gone away for a while
Not telling why
He's tired of living nowhere
His face is mine
Where should I be?
Where should I go?
Who should I speak to?
Who should I know?
Sometimes you've go to vanish
To justify your place in life
But I'm praying the moon will fall tonight
It'll certainly make things much better
There's a time when you need to draw the line
And just let it bleed forever
But I'm praying the sun will burn the sky
And reveal the gates of heaven
But nothing concludes when you die
Because the pendulum swings forever

He keeps the remedy at hand
He's playing God
No questions will be unanswered
With every thought
With every hit

And I can't sleep for God may take me
