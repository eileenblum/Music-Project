I'm gonna make you sorry with this end machine
I'm gonna put my name back on the acknowledgment sheet
I'll take your shows of drama and end their scenes
I'll take your narcissist mirrors and shatter the dreams
I'll use the blood your spilling to write a new tune
I'll take your romantic nights and bring down the moon
You know, I know what happened
I knew it was true
But what I can't believe
I cannot believe it was you

I'm gonna push the evolution to fascist extremes
I'm gonna push the faceless egos off their mountain peaks
I'll take your anthems of insurgence right out of mainstream
We'll say God Bless America, but minus the "B"
So I built walls just to shield myself
From the full force of the feelings I felt
With questions no answers so what to do?
Just end your world
Because I cannot believe it was you

Yeah this is the part of the show where we end the hate
This is the part of the show where we end the games
This is the part of the show where we end the scene, for you

This is the part of the show where we end the hate
This is the part of the show where we end the scene
This is the part of the show where we start to fall
This is the part of the show where you see the fall of the Pieces of nothing
Pieces of nothing
Pieces of nothing
The walls are broken down
