Staring into fading light
Miles from where we started and the end line

All that's stable seems to change
And the door of moods is open in full swing
But don't you see the world I've affected
With a million minds that I've infected
And we can see the end is close at hand

I never wanted to leave
Betrayed all I believe
To be without you well I can't take it
I never wanted to stay
But what was true went away
To be without you well I can't take it
Drifting into empty space
The first of those to finish in a no-man race
Because it's a world of questions that have no answers
And you think you've got them like a cancer
That's eating away at your wasted life

I never wanted to leave
Betrayed all I believe
To be without you well I can't take it
I never wanted to stay
But what was true went away
To be without you well I can't take it
I never want to change
But all I had rearranged
To be without you well I can't take it
