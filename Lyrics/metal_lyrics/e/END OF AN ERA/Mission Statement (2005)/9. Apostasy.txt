Devils haunt in my life's obsessions
Living for the deadly seven
We're playing the games and betting our lives
I've hit the bottom and reached a new high
Envious of every persons pleasure
Touching base at desperate measures
We're playing the games and betting our lives
And digging holes to bury our lies

Of our evolutions remaining
And though my heart is always straining
Of our evolutions remaining undiscovered
Ice is forming and the air will leave
When you're trying to find what to believe
We're playing the games and betting our lives
And leaving hope and faith behind
I've come down to my last confession
I cannot purge this new possession
We're playing the games and betting our lives
And digging the holes to bury our lies

See what this did to me

Of our evolutions remaining
And though my heart is always straining
Of our evolutions remaining undiscovered
