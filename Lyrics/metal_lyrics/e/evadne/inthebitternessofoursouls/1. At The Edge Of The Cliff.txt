After a long path,
There's a hope in the reality of my own
On the top of a hill at the edge of a cliff
When sorrow pass and tenderness never came
My destiny is near nearer than you
I'm crying for you

Hearing to my heart I have no pride to life
Thinking in our love, my salvation is the die

Our time has lost
And never come back
Now I'm here at the edge of this cliff
Sorrow in my thoughts, I passed all this time
Searching something who can close my eyes
Finally the search to the end arrives
I'm feeling the fear of my heart emanate
Thinking on you my remains are sad
You were the best of all my life

Fear, sorrow, madness
Too much things presents to end my life
Ruins, I dream
At the edge of my broken desires
My own desires

Hope in my eyes oblivion
Lost in the time of what I was
Since you not are I'm burning
In the closure of myself

My salvation finally arrives
At the edge of this cliff
Jump in to the arms of dead
Jump to end my life !!
