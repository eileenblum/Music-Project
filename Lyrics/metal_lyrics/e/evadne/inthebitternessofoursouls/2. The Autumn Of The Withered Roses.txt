The autumn comes, dies the summer
My garden is all what I have
A gathering of withered roses
A gathering to end my wreath

They are all my life, the happiness for my eyes
I'll never see again my flowers

You break my heart once again
Let my eyes without them, without nothing
You stole the smell of life, smell of dead
For a dream letarged

All for me was your sight every day and every night

I wish youÂ´d be with me always
You know, since I am alone
You are the only thing that plenty my heart
Now, at the threshold of my death
I feel sadness but isn't for meâ¦
Endlessly please remember me !

The autumn comes, dies the summer
I know my life is near to expire
Almighty came the autumn, impassive my die

Sadness, despair for see my garden rotten
The last time, the last goodbye
My flowers, my Eden friends, I want to rest near you
Eternally

My flowers, my Eden friends one last thing I pray you
A wish for the next spring, let me grow together you

Rotten roses on my foot, I feel the incoming of dead
Is the time to my sleep, is the time to made my wreath

My last breath, your last scent, I feel the incoming of dead
Is the time for my sleep, is time for my eternal rest
