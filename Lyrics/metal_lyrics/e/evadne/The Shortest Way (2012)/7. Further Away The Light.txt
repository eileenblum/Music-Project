World of shades, wait for me
Pale paradise, welcome me in your arms
And slowly arrives this pain
Is an enormous void of cold silence
As a black veil that falls over me to wrap me for the rest of the eternity
World of shades, accept me. pale paradise, shelter me in your arms
Carry me as soon as you can, carry me to her side
No way to return, i will sleep in dark arms
The promised light turns into shades. the pleasure promised, unbearable pain
Comes to help me to die how has it been my will to leave this world, to leave it behind
Carry me as soon as you can. carry me soon to her side
No way to return, i will sleep in darkness arms
I long that you are waiting for me
Dream that you are calling me
