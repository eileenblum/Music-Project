And i'm alone in this sad instant of my life. alone in this cold and restless ocean of tears
Without you i am like autumn leaves, falling into the depths of pain
In your memories i retreat, into this hell
In this complete solitude, without you i'll fall down
Into the abyss of the loneliness, i'll tail down
A sheet in white
Deprived of your sweet mouths
Gone aground in a sea of regrets
In this complete solitude without you i will fall into the abyss of distress
A naked space
Missing memories, lacking emotions. gone aground, yes i am
A sheet, in immaculate white
Fragile as the light of a candle
Dying, in the moment of expiration
In this complete solitude like a floe of cold ice
I melt without you, i fall apart
Because i am as the autumn leaves falling into the depths of pain
In your memories i retreat, into this hell
"e vaja jo los sepulcres cercant interrogant Ã nimes infernades
E respondÃ­an car no sÃ³n companyades d'altre que mi en son contÃ­nuu plant"
