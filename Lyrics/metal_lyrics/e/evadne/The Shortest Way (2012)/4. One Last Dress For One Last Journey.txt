Whole alone waiting for your last breath, waiting for your last signal of life
Your soul is going apart from me
My soul has gone descended into hell
I will never see you again
You are so beautiful dressed in white, you're like a bride in the altar waiting for your love
You are so beautiful dressed in white, even angels have cried on having. known that...
The bells toll now for you
I haven't got the chance to give you a kiss of farewell
And you have condemned me to this miserable life
We deliver you to the soil with the eyes full of tears and with the barren hope of your return
That the flowers and my tears gone with you in your last journey
My dreams blur just as blood in water
I can't see you never, ever, again...
