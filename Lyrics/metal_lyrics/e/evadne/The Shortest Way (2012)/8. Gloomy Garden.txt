Now, i'm here alone, wandering across the lands where everything ends
I walking alone looking for my lover, looking for you
It hovers on me the night of the times
The shortest way to meet you under my feet has begun,
The white light is blinding me but let me get closer to you
Against the light i can't see clearly
The white light is blinding me
The same light dazzles my heart
Beyond the light i'm sure that you're there
It hovers on me the night of the times
The shortest way to meet you again
This white light. against the light i can't see clearly
This white light. beyond the light i'm sure that you are
Gloomy place full of light. souls are dancing and laughing around me
Gloomy place empty of life. they are whispering me that i wasted my life
In this gloomy garden i'm searching what i've loved most
In this gloomy garden i have lost all
Is just a dream
Is just an illusion
A broken dream
A foolish illusion
