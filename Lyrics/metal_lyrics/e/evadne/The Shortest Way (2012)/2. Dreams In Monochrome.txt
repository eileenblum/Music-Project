Endless days of gloom and suffering, obscure threshold to my incoming hell
Endless nights of gloom and loneliness, obscure threshold of my daily jail,
Into this darkness i lie. into this nightmare that is the uncertainty
Every night in my dream i lay barren hopes in a new dawn,
Into this nightmares in monochrome, that show me why i am succumbing to the
Disenchantment and why i have this bitter taste of self-destruction that you leave in my heart
You still are by my side, and i'm alone
Why, i don't know why i am succumbing to the disenchantment and why i have this bitter
Taste of self-destruction that you leave in my heart
You still are by my side, and i'm alone
I am lost in this cold silence, good time will never return
I am lost in this cold darkness, now my hearth turns into...
Ash, my yearning turns into ashes
Pure suffering has become my nightmares and all my dreams
Is useless try to escape from this jail where your remembrance
Is now my warder in my dreams in monochrome
