My soul slides towards death because your fire slowly burns out
Stay with me, please feel my hand. don't go alone beyond the light
Because my existence will fuse in black if your heart breaks as a fragile glass
The death surrounds you, and in its breathless is sheltered my hope
Now there is no place for hope
Come with me, please take my hand. let's go together to eternity
We will cross together the threshold of this world and what we find behind doesn't mind
Don't let me behind in this sorrowful world
Because my existence will fuse in black if your way will moves away from mine
