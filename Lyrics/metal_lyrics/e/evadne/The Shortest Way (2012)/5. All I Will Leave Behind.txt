The cold proceeds this time of death
Nothing ties me to this world, but i have one more things to beg for
That the soil swallows us together, is the last beg of my life
Excuse me parents and friends, but this is my sad farewell
Nothing ties me to this world and nothing else remains to say
Please let me die in solitude, please leave me alone
The cold precedes this time of death
My world is falling down, tonight i will be dead
Why do i have to continue living
Why bearing this suffering,
Why am i condemned
For what i see a new sunrise
Â«i hope that you'll understand that all your affection. will never be able to compare with a
Second by her side. i don't want you to accompany me in this feeling i only want that you
Understand that my place is together with her, sincerely yoursÂ»
I abandon this world as i came to it, crying
All i will leave behind will come with me forever
Few have been the tears of happiness and many those that ruined me
I'm crying thinking about all i will leave behind
All alone with your remains
All alone with my time arriving to the end
Tired of this life that i leave behin
