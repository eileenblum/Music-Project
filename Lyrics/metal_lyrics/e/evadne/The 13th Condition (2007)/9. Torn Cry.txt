All in me flow to misery
Drop to drop spill my tears
Because I am the victim of your worst thoughts
Of your darkest desires
My cry, whisper torn in silence
Wounded are my spirit an my heart
Replete of hate against you
The misery floats in the atmosphere
And for me is not a relied to cry
The loathing feed by my agony
Makes that my hate becomes in phobia
Becomes in a torn cry!

Beyond the veil of hope, nothing is real
Beyond the veil of my innocence, ripped dreams

My cry your last mistake
Please, save me to fall into this one
Cold and cruel world
Where born was not my choice

From my grieved soul flow the tears of my rage
From the hidden place of my spite emerge a tear cry

Beyond the veil of hope, nothing is real
Beyond the veil of my innocence, broken dreams

I am a fallen angel
The atonement of your sins
You are my nightmares demon
You bring the emptiness to my life!
