When the night and day quarrel
The reign of a same sky
I will place them to be baptized for the dew
To be withered by the time
As the loneliness is withering me
I will place them
Over your tomb and I will cry

For you Iâm crying
For the wishes we had to leave behind
ThereÂ´s no comfort to me, only a cruel grief
In the solitude of the night
I will descent to the hell
To steal the cloak of the death
I want to cover the firmament with it
From the mourning that covers my heart

For you IÂ´m crying
For you caress, cause you were all my life
ThereÂ´s no comfort to me, nothing in what believe
Remembering times already past
Face to face, desires and pain
Facing to the death

And I will cry

While of knees screaming I will beg
A new chance to be on your candy arms, again
Over your tomb I will place them
In memory of time already past

The cloak of dead
Is covering me
Is covering all
