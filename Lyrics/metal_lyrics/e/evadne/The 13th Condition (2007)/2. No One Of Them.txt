No one of them mercy deserve
To endless torments they will be condemned
Nailed in crosses redeem their sin
And their restless shadows eternally will roam.

By the cross of the sword your end will arrive
Your poisoned doctrine will go away from this land.

For the centuries they have prayed
The sacred icons that you decided to raise
Accept them in your glory.
Give them your grace eternal
Announcing them your fall !!!

By the cross of the sword your end will arrive
Your poisoned doctrine will go away from this land.
The holocaust that you has created to us
Will turn against you
All of you will disappear in the silence.

Eternally will roam
And to your eyes
Centuries of darkness
And to your souls
Centuries of pain.
