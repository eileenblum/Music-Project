In the fire, you should burn
In the resentful fire where dwells your curse
No one could escape from this ethereal flame
From this ethereal world, where dying is the hope
Is full of sentiments that will never be fulfilled.

Sacrifice all for what youÂ´ve fought
Surrender to the evidenceâ¦youÂ´re alone!
Everlasting tales will fill you of suffering
And this torment will guide you to die.

The life, seen from your own eyes
Is antagonistic to what you had desired
The paradise is closed for your descendants
And for us, the paradise is a bleak and ruthless place

Sacrifice all for what youÂ´ve fought and loss
Surrender, the evidence is that youÂ´re no one
You are nothing, following in the attempt
And this torment will guide you to die.
