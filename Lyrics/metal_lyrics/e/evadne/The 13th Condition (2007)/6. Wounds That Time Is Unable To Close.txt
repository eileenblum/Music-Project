You are weary, for each turn that the world gives
Growns in you the certainty that youÂ´re nothing
Unhappy, your life is a tragedy that every day
Gives you more reasons to escape.

And nobody knows that your fight dwell inside.
Every night the demons awaits you on the darkness
All your dreams outcome in angels burning in the paradise
No one for you will hold his hand
IÂ´m not dreaming, is the cruel life.

At the beginning you thought that all your wounds
Could be closed by the time
You believed in the lie of the happiness
Then understand that the life will hurt us until the end
Misfortune real of the every day

You are weary, for each turn that the world gives
Growns in you the certainty that youÂ´re nothing
Distressed your life is a tragedy that every day
Gives you more reasons to cry!

Cry! Search for relief in the cry trying to heal
The wounds that time is unable to close

All this wasted time searching for the happiness
As them showed you a cry of mankind lost in the void of the innocence
No one helps no one

No one for you will hold his hand
YouÂ´re not dreaming, is the cruel life
That will hurt you until the end
Why sustains the pain, for what maintain the life?

Is not the sense you want to feel , and cry
For the sunset of your heart
Will the stars shine in the sky, and cry
The serenity of peace be reached
On the instant of die
