The moon turns off; the sun will never shine
The star are remains and is quiet the land
In the mirror of the time I couldnât see your reflex
I only see my despair, my own desperate
The end of your life has marked me as a fire
You condemned me to life against my own desire
Wherever you are I always be by your side
Better than this I only know the die

Dreaming in the past time when you're all
I can't believe the end of your life
Since you not are I used to cry
Every night, the end of your life

Only I can know how strong is the pain
Only you from the other side how much I love you

Now see in this endemic fire
How destiny has broken our biblic paradise
Becoming in a bleak desert of silence
With no point of reference for me

Unforgiving remains saying what couldnât be
Whispers the moon, you are not for me
I can't believe this cruel reality
I can 't believe why you arenât for me

Believe in my promise, Iâll be on your side
Eternally with you

Feeling the wind I use to cry I canât believe
That destiny decide to me this bleak remembrance
Each night I cry alone as you
The end of your life

How sad is my existence without you
I forget whereâs my path
Your remembrance corrode me
I don't need to be alive
Can you remember all my promise?
Can you remember that
Our souls will be eternal
Our souls will become in one
