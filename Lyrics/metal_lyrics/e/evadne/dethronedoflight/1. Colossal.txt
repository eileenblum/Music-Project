Forgotten
Dethroned
Devoid of all hope
Unseen for the rest
So easy is to lose
So easy to fall from grace
At the feet of a world, that tramples you day by day

Lost in endless days
Yearning worn old times
Drained by sorrow
My thoughts feed your madness
And my soul drowns without solace

Fades the sun, and fade the words
Blind and speechless face off this open scar

Slowly and gently, cradle me in your cold arms every night
Oppresses me and whispers...

Holocaust of a dying soul
That clings to a meaningless life
Screaming and bleeding from within
Dismantling your poor existence
Under a mantle of solitude
Your life escapes through your fingers.
Between my arms, once again

Stranded in a strange world
Anchored to past
Drained by sorrow
My acts feed your madness, one by one
And my soul is drowning...

Forgotten
Dethroned
Devoid of all hope
Unseen for the rest
So complicated to find
A dying ember of light
The sorrow embrace me
AND TOGETHER WE HOLD THE WEIGHT OF THIS COLOSSAL WOUND
