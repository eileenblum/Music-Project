And it is true, now is too late to be alive
Is so cruel the lover waitâ¦
And here I am behind the curtains of solitude
Beyond the veil of my absent gaze
Trying to forget the traces
That you absence leave in me.

Thwart and deceived I am, bitter tears run my checks
I canÂ´t forget you ephemeral words of farewell
Awaiting the beloved who goes in the cold of the night
I donÂ´t have her warm
Every day agonise my love for her
Now no more sadness tears
No more disillusion, she is not going to return.
Constantly in my head resound
Hopeful words that you said,
To made me trust in you, and you lie.

Liar, for you absence I will die
My innards twist inside IÂ´m desperate
Lies,for you lies I want to die
Understand it, without you IÂ´ve lost the sense of life.

Awaiting the beloved who goes
Into my frozen heart no rest place to
All the pain that afflict to my poor heart
Now no more sadness tears no more distress
The desperation comes to take me far away
How can I live without your love?
How t olive without hope? ThatÂ´s my secretâ¦

Every morning rise the sun
Rise for me perhaps for one last time
And the hope is almost lost
The same last hope deceived for your words
Words that hurt up to die
The death, way to escape and find
Go to sky and find your place to rest alone,
Aloneâ¦awaiting

A place to rest where I can remember that I amâ¦
Finally the pain is over my strength and my courage
I want to take my last path
Is better the death is better to die
Forget the ends of my despair
Lighten the penumbra of my heart
But now is too late Iâm convinced
That thereÂ´s no other way to scape
A place to rest where I can remember that I am
â¦.Awaiting
