Lost in this world of emptiness
The echo of my steps resounds all around

Adrift in this path of uncertainty
My restless soul guides me to the arms of death
Searching the cold blaze in the darkness
Of the barren world, no light shines in this empty sky

My mind surrenders to despair
While the complete darkness hovers around me
Only the time will decide my fate
Only wandering relieves my sorrow

Lost in this world of emptiness
The echo of my steps resound all around
