Slashing through a holocaust, breaking through another war
Full on attack, ripping through the armed force
I see a threat that is fucking with an army of merciless brutality

Relentless assault - I engage the assault
Relentless assault - I engage the assault
On the command, with rise of my hand an army of one pound you into nothing

The enemy holds only one right
The right to die by a military strength
Enemy action, fueling my aggression
Counter attack is suicide

Soldiers coming straight ahead
I'll unleash the dogs of war
Smash 'em with the first strike
Walk away and let 'em live, I think I won't

The enemy begging for mercy
The war machine will chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Relentless army trained to perfection
Armed for the assault, march for the onslaught
Extermination driven by blood
Our brutal force pushing the attack
All that you got is not enough
Step in a world where machine guns lead the way

I'm for the assault
Relentless assault
