I'm being pushed toward the wrong way
Given the choice of no return
I got the world as an enemy
And I got everyone inside it trying to rip me apart
I'm headed straight to the point in which
I'm driven to violence
Enforce a threat aimed at me I must react
And then I'm driven to violence

Violence - is looking to me
The only way to show you who I am
And what I fucking stand for
Violence - anyone, anything ultimately ignored
Makes me commit assault and battery
Violence - is what I enforce when I'm enraged
Physically I fuck you up, mentally I overload
Driven to violence

I'm driven to violence
