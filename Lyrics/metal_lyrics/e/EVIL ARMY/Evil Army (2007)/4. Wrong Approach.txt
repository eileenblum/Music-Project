Who the hell are you
Not shit to me and I wouldn't mind if I had to hurt you
I wouldn't care and I'd do it again
Listen to what I say, do what I say or pay the price
Or end up like the rest, end up dead, a casualty

Don't try to give me no answers
Cause I don't wanna hear your mouth

You got me fucked up with someone else, what's your problem
You came to me with the wrong approach, I had to hurt you
You wanna be something that you fucking ain't
You can try to be someone else, it won't work, it's too late
