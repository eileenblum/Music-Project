What is this that's coming toward my way
I'm looking eye to eye at the face of death
I know it's calling me, I know I must resist
One wrong move and I'm caught within it's grip

They're coming to watch me fall

Hand of doom is knocking at my door
But I won't accept defeat in any form
Show me the wrath that hold the ineffective strength
And I'll be the only one to see ain't nothing there
