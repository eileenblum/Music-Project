All over the fucking news
Maniac on the loose
Ain't got no butcher knife
Machete takes your life

Stop hiding, start running
Don't worry, he's coming right for you
Then you're trapped by yourself

Everyone dies on Friday the 13th

A masked murderer
Someone you probably heard of
Don't feel no fucking pain
Superhuman strength

Stop lying, stop trying
Don't worry, you're dying
Too late, don't fight
He's gonna end it all tonight
