Unleashed from the dark
Behold death
I walk alone
But it stands by my side

Reveal the truth of what the future holds
Endless road into the dark
Gates are closed, life has shut you out
And ten you called into the realm of death

Kept from the light
The sacred path
But as long as I'm locked away
I'll die a thousand deaths

I still search
For a reason to stay
In a world I cannot grasp
But hope is lost
