On the attack, ripping through a battlefield
Full metal jacket keeping me alive

He's telling me to kill
Sergeant says to fucking kill

Leatherlung forcing me to destroy, sucked in a trap
Rifle in my hand, enforcer of combat
Commander of death sends the army out to slaughter
Begging for more, ready to eat their own guts

I'm commanded to fight
Take out the order sergeant says
I'm commanded to kill
Take out the order sergeant says
I'm commanded to fight
Take out the order sergeant says

Do or die, gung-ho, blood makes the grass grow
Soldier by will, not by force - sergeant says
Unload my gun in the face of the enemy
Unending strength and artillery - sergeant says
I can see light shining through the smoke
Another day of hell and no hope - sergeant says
Gung-ho as fuck, more than I would ever think
Honor and power ultimately ordered to kill
