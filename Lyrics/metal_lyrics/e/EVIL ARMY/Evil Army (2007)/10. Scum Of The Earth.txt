One day a real rain will come and wash away
All of the scum off of the streets
It makes me sick, I can't eat
All these people trying to be a fucking pimp
Turning 13 year old girls into
Motherfucking prostitutes
I will be the rain to come clean up this mess
The police don't do shit, not a thing so I do the rest
Everyone around me seems to change the way I think
Lowlife junkie shooting dope
To me they're all the fucking same

They're the scum of the earth
Kill the scum of the earth
They're the scum of the earth

A bastard tried to rob a store
I shot him in the head
He got beat with a pole even though he was laying dead
When I found somebody that would sell me a gun
I took it to the main guy, shot 'em he's the worst one
My nickelplated 25 did not come with a case
It's coming out from in my sleeve to shoot you in the face
Death enforcer, psychopath, justice has been served
I done my job, there's nothing left

I've killed the scum of the earth
