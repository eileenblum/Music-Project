From the sky I will descend
Armed force rise from the dead
Soon they'll attack with the rise of my hand
Unleash the fury at my command

[Chorus:]
I must destroy
I gotta destroy

Unscarred, armed to the teeth
All your strength is given to me
Wade through blood in the bottomless pit
Slip and fall into my grip
Reaching out but nobody is there
Follow me to misery and terror
Tortured soul stabbed in the back 
Left to die alone 
Then I attack
