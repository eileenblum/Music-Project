I, Commander send in the troops
Arm them and teach them to fight
You are the enemy destined to fall
Gunfire is my only light

[Chorus:]
I will the lead the way
Hail I, Commander

I, destroyer bringer of war
Take you for all that you're worth
Nuclear warhead coming your way
Wiped from the face of the earth

Massive destructor walks without fear
Ready to die for the corp
Backed by an army ten million strong
Stand in the eye of the war
