[Part I]

[Arlen, High Priest of the Crystal Palace]
...and suddenly...
The Sign of Lor, that warded the ancient tomb of the Adamantine Heart, Guardians of the Crystal Palace, shone heavily in the night.
There, where light and darkness fought their epic battles, shadows leaped into existence, dueling on either side.
But what many failed to see, was he who was darker than the shadows.
Fighting furiously, pounding like the Dragon'sheart, yet carefully considering every single move.
...it was...
The Disciple of the Night under a starless sky

[Arlen]
Ancient graves were violated
Undead awoken by the light
Long gone forces recreated
Joining the Disciple in the fight

[The Army]
Lain to rest, ancient warriors
Revenge! Revenge!

[The Army of the Adamantine Heart]
Put to death by ancient swords
Aeons have passed on since we died
Rejoined honourbound for the Disciple

[The Legion of Steel]
For the glory of the Crystal Palace
And the pride of our beloved lands
We'll unite our forces,
The shadow army will fall by our hands

[The Army]
Lain to rest, ancient warriors
Through magic reborn, revenge! Revenge!

[The Legion of Steel]
For the honour of our king and country
The splendour of our beloved lands
The flame still burns underneath the ashes
We'll crush the enemy with our bare hands

[Part II]

[Arlen]
...and so the Legion of Steel battled bravely against the storming hordes of the former Adamantine Heart, slaying the shadows by the hundreds.
But they kept on creeping into the dark halls.
Knowing they would never be able to win this battle by the might of their blades alone, one of the Legion's lieutenants, Jindereth, fought his way through the evil hordes, in order to reach the Sign of Lor.
Realizing that if he failed to close the seal, the Legion would be overrun, and the Crystal Palace would fall...

[Jindereth]
Follow me into the shadow horde
The path is leading to the Sign of Lor
If I have to sacrifice my life, then I will
With my death I will stop this war

Bring the dead their eternal rest
By closing the Adamantine's Tomb
And bring peace to the Crystal Palace once more

[The Army]
Men of ancient glory wield thy magic blades
Adamantine Heart Guards shadow sentinels
Stand together to avert our tragic fate
Stand together!

[The Disciple of the Night]
Or be damned back into Hell!

[Jindereth]
Follow me!!

[Part III]

[Arlen]
...the battle was long and exhausting, but Jindereth and his strongest soldiers managed to get within reach of the Sign of Lor, using flares and torches to keep the shadows at bay.
But then...
Coming through line after line of shadow warriors, a tall dark figure stepped up towards the Legion of Steel, holding his cold Nightblade high above his head, loudly cursing at Jindereth...

[The Disciple of the Night and the Army of the Adamantine Heart]
Who are you to enter our sacred resting place?
The power of our immortal souls has opened up the seal
From the hour of our demise, since our deaths aeons ago
We have sought revenge and we will reveal our true face

[Jindereth and the Legion of Steel]
For the glory of the Crystal Palace
And the pride of our beloved lands
We'll unite our forces
The shadow army will fall by our hands

For the honour of our king and country
The splendour of our beloved lands
The flame still burns underneath the ashes
We'll crush the enemy with our bare hands

[Jindereth]
To battle and victory!!

[Part IV]

[Arlen]
...the Legion of Steel, under Jindereth' s command, charged towards the seal.
Many brave soldiers found a painful death in that desperate run.
Those who survived could feel the magic pouring out of the tomb, and penetrating their bodies, when suddenly...
...Big flashes of lightning filled the sky, followed by deafening thunder, which numbed even the bravest souls.
But one man was left standing, high on top of the tomb, bathing in bright sunlight shining through the clouds.
It was him, he had done it!
Jindereth had managed to close the seal!
Yet. As he stepped down, he felt the Disciple's icy Nightblade thrusting into his back.
In his fall, he made one final swing with his sword, and slew the Disciple of the Night, sending him back into the fiery abyss that is now his final resting place

[The Legion of Steel]
For the glory of the Crystal Palace
And the pride of our beloved lands
He has slain the Disciple of the Night
While his life was slipping through his hands

For the honour of our king and country
He has accepted the fate he met
For the future he sacrificed his life
Thy name will be remembered brave Jindereth

[Arlen]
Jindereth...
Thy name will forever be remembered in these lands
Forever...
