[I. Solitude]

Under the mountains, deep in the world's core
Hiding under ancient rock and stone
There I have dwelt for a dark timeless age
In a cruel world, cold, lost, alone

Within these caverns of grim shadows
The rock surrounding me
Hides me from the light, brings me comfort
Caught underneath and yet as free
As I could ever wish to be

Under the mountain I can
Hide myself, hide my sorrow,
Hide my deepest pain and grievances of old
All my days seem like endless nights
So dark, not a single star above

Within these caverns of grim shadows
The rock surrounding me
Hides me from the light, brings me comfort
Caught underneath and yet as free
As I could ever wish to be

I can feel it, I feel it, it's near
Now is the time to come to me...

[II. The Oath]

Watching the world through corrupted eyes,
Piercing the shadow with their cruel sight
Nothing escapes from the cunning hunter's gaze
Nothing escapes in White-Face light

And so I hunt down the thief - BAGGINS!!
The traitor - BAGGINS, SHIRE!!
The filthy liar that took away my One

I alone am the rightful owner of the One
The precious, my precious-s-s-s-s-s...

[III. A Twist Of Fate]

A bleak sun rises in the East,
Yet the night's reign is prolonged
Blackest of clouds cast from Orodruin
Darkness falls upon...

...the barren land I have to cross
To aid the master in his quest
Yet my goal remains unspoken,
(I swear that) I will find no rest

Until he holds his precious One
Safe and tight in longing hands
A baneful twist of fate spells chaos
For all of Arda's lands...

For all of Arda's lands shall tremble
And despair under my reign...
They will call me, call me The Great

[IV. Sorrow And The Dreamer]

My sorrow now ablaze,
The call from the Darkland
I shall not heed...
The eye of evil flames

One part of me, corrupted by greed,
One part still dreams of old forests of green
And the beauty of all that remains to be seen
Released from this curse, unbound and free

[V. Of Reason And Lost Ones]

In the Land of Shadows
Under barren rock and ash
The final change was made
That set the final fate

Yet somewhere locked inside
