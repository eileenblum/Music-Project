[LindalÃ«, Elven minstrel of Athelorn]
...Oh hear ye! Fair folk! Gather around
And listen to my song
A fairytale of Sylvan Dreams
And Trolls, mighty and strong

An ancient story written
In the leaves of every tree
Of Dryadfolk and magic oaks
That set the forest free

And so the tale begins
In the snowy woods of Athelorn
On a cold and misty wintermorning

When the Dryads of the North
Heard a warning from the trees
And they started to sing...

[The Elder Oak]
Listen now, Dryad folk
This here is the Elder Oak
Something's prowling through
Our most beloved woods tonight

Trolls are coming, they are near
The trees they all tremble in fear
All my branches warn me
And tell me you must hide

[Dryads]
Oh Mother of the Woods, there must be something we can do
Although we heed your warning, know that we are not alone
We shall sing for the aid of our allies, Pixies, Sylphs and Elves
And Nymphs will come and turn the Trolls to stone

Singing for the dawn in the forest of the Dryads
At the coming nightfall we shall dance along the trees
Messengers of green, sentinels of woodland,
Bound to our magical oaks eternally, but forever we're free

[Trolls]
Bashing and ramming our way through the trees
Slaying and eating all creatures we see
Nothing can stop us from doing as we please
Masters of the wild, the Trollish way to be

Rage, hunger, bloodlust and hate
Must find food before it's too late
Frenzied berserkers, havoc we create
Rending your flesh apart, troll-bait!!

[Nymphs]
My sisters, oh, do not despair
The Sylvan League has come to aid
In the name of the Goddess of the Woods
The Dryad Grove will remain

[Trolls]
What is this puny creature, this useless waste of space
Annoying little treefolk called the Dryad race
Listen tiny buggers, you shall be our food
And all your magic treasure will be ours to loot

[Nymphs]
Turn to stone!

[Dryads]
Singing for the dawn in the forest of the Dryads
At the coming nightfall we shall dance along the trees
Messengers of green, sentinels of woodland,
Bound to our magical oaks eternally, but forever...

Singing for the dawn in the forest of the Dryads
At the coming nightfall we shall dance along the trees
Messengers of green, sentinels of woodland,
Bound to our magical oaks eternally, but forever we're free
