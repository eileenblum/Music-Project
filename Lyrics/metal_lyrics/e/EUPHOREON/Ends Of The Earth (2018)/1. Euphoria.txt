When the shackles are broken tonight
Seize your chance for it may be your last
You opened the door to another world of pain
Then sought salvation on the other side
Acquire the elixir to ease your mind
Donât you feel the need to change
The indifference thatâs unexplained
Unleash me now
You hold the key

All you ever were or will be
Created in disharmony
Decimate the walls of fire
I canât stand the heat much longer

Can you feel the release of pure adrenaline
After the bright lights comes the emptiness inside
Come back to me now as my world crashes down
Will our paths intertwine
Shattering everything
Destroying all I am
Becoming inspiration for the next generation
I am exuberance
I am enlightenment
On the verge of collapse as the next wave attacks
Let me show you my true strength now

Donât go chasing shadows
In the middle of the night
You listen for warnings
Illuminate my sense of sight
On a cold midwinter morning
Itâs all turning into despair
I am destiny
I will exist forever
On the road to immortality
I wonât leave a trace
I wonât make a sound
Exuberant touch
Exhilarant desire
Wake me up so I canât return again
Raise me up when Iâve got nothing left to give
Donât be afraid of what stands in your way
And I wonât forget the reason Iâm here

When your back is up against the wall and you feel strung out
Anxiety will eat me alive
Then suddenly begin to die
As despair turns into delight
Persevering through the turbulence
Bittersweet emotions kill the innocence

Systematic self-destruction (is causing me pain)
Sabotaging all my visions (losing perspective again)
Iâm a master of the darkness (Iâm the poison you crave)
Youâre the chosen one so take it
