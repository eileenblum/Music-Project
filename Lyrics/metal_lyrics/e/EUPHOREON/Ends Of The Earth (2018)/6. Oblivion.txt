The inquisitive eyes of a nameless traveller
Undefined and misunderstood
Only friend is solitude
Only wish is to feel the sun again
Unfulfilled potential
This search bringing me to my knees
I cry for the remnants of a life
Once flourishing
Unraveling

Ride towards the storm
Feel the energy flow through you and guide you through the night
Wonder whatâs beyond
Follow the light at the end of the tunnel thatâs burning bright

Remembering the hopes and dreams of yesterdays
Iâll never let them fade away (coming back from the brink of death)
Sacrifices I canât forget
Now Iâve see whatâs left of me
Tell me where have those feelings gone
Cast into oblivion

Staring at the autumn sun
Will leave me hanging on for someone to get me out of here
The past canât be undone but the world keeps turning for everyone
Through the looking glass of time
Iâve seen through the gates of time and it all will be mine once again
Iâm lost in the game but Iâve got something to believe in

The tide will turn when you least expect
Gates flood open to memories
Everything I touch turns to grey
Nothing will ever feel the same
Superstitious I arrive (and I die)
Silence is the enemy (of our kind)
Hunger for another chance at life
Beyond redemption I ride

Remembering the hopes and dreams of yesterdays
Iâll never let them fade away (coming back from the brink of death)
Iâm back from oblivion
Hapless in the face of adversity
You turned your back on me
Ultimate sacrifice at the end
Iâm back from oblivion

Until the final breath is drawn
Donât hesitate and throw your life away
Nothing can stop me now
The doubts inside will be laid to rest as I fall asleep

I found solace in the rain
Lived to tell a tale of escape
Shouldnât be this hard to understand
Why this land keeps leaving the weak for dead
And everytime I run
I see the damage Iâve done
To the sacred order of the earth
When itâs all said and done
I wonât be the only one
