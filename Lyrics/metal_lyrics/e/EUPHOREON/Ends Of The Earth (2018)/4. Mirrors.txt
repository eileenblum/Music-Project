If we canât accept the reasons why
Weâre out of touch and cast aside
Just a limitless expedition
Through the grand illusion of reality
Losing my balance on the edge of desperation
Aspirations I abandoned slowly return
Consequence for existence
How can I find the way to deliverance

Eternal suffering within
The rise and fall of a tortured mind
Thinking what could have been
Is the death of everything
A strange anomaly
Was it all just a dream
Looking back through
The mirrors of tragedy
The challenge ahead of me
Join me on the journey
As we race to infinity

Take me back to the days when I felt alive
Living with regrets that I canât deny
Iâm crushed by the weight for eternity
To the point where I lost belief
It all went wrong and integrity disappeared
Those days are gone and thereâs nothing left to lose
Turn the page and write something new
Itâs the only way to truly exist

If the wheels fall off and you spiral out of control
Will you find the strength to go alone
Fallen paradise lays forgotten
Torn apart by arrogance and corruption
I donât want to repeat the failures
Mistakes I wish I could change
Everything you do will come back to you
When dreams will come true

Donât know when I lost my way
Donât know where Iâll find the faith
But we all go down in a sea of flames
Thatâs all she wrote for me
Running away from the truth until itâs nothing but a distant memory
Itâs just a fragment of my imagination
The last step in my recovery

Eternal suffering within
The rise and fall of a tortured mind
Thinking what could have been
Is the death of everything
The darkness and light
The screams of innocence
The thorns will follow me
Back to reality
The past canât haunt me
Iâm desperately holding on to the last strings of my sanity

Iâm nothing but a spark in history
For many years I wandered aimlessly
To the stars weâll make it another day
For the futureâs shrouded in mystery

Take me back to the place where I felt alive
Living with regrets that I canât deny
Iâm crushed by the weight for eternity
To the point where I lost belief
In the end weâre just preparing for death
The day the when the light returns to you
Fight or flight
Dark or light
That day I was never the same again

Iâm a scapegoat for an illogical system
Paid the price for a lack of defiance
Walking through the shards of broken glass
Itâs a death by a thousand cuts
Reflecting myself in the mirror won't become any easier
As I crash into the wall
You're the one to wake me up
