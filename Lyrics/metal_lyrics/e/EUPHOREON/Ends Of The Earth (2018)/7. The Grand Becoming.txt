The ultimate prize awaits the ones who seek redemption
In the dead of the night
Uprising for the right to a revolution
Comprehending gravity of the situation
Iâm blazing through a trail of flames (as I search for)
Pioneering the great escape (what I live for)
Shielded from the elements
Relieved to be alive

In the hour of awakening
Do my eyes deceive
Itâs all becoming clear now
Behold the power
Come back and face your adversary
Triumphant return of the great redeemer
The last act
The grand becoming
Donât relent
Let your downfall fuel the fire in me

Brace yourself for the new horizon
A false sense of security is hovering
Awoken to serenity
Engraved in stone and carved into my memory
No longer held by degeneration
Mythological spirits rising from the dead
Guarding your precious life
I will not listen to what they say

Thereâs no way to ease the tension
Creations arise and restore the balance of power
Under cold light true colours begin to show
Seasons will change but desire remains the same

With the dying embers of the flame
Weâre closer to the dawn of a new era
Break free and overcome the odds
Itâs all happening for a reason
Celebrate newfound prosperity
Victorious
Will be our legacy
With the sun weâll rise again
To fight for supremacy

Thereâs no way to ease the tension
Creations arise and restore the balance of power
Under cold light true colours begin to show
Concealing your fate was a curse and all for nothing
Enduring the heat through the ages
A storm will rage with the force of a million stars
Thereâs no end to the tyranny
To end the violence that surrounds our world

Going nowhere on this journey to find out who we are
Iâve become a shadow of myself and it shows
Iâm taking a chance when the night falls
No evil will take me down
Experience gained through adversity
I canât become what they want me to be
Iâm forever, Iâm forever me
