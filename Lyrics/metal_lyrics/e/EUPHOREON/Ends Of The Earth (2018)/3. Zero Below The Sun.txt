As the red sun falls beneath the horizon
Weâve crossed the point of no return
It feels like we are drifting through the twilight
While the stars are echoing signs
Through the fires that rage along the way
In search of a higher purpose
We create foundations for a new beginning
Weâll rise from the ashes of a frozen world

Too long Iâve been deceived
Iâm leaving everything behind
The memories
The shattered dreams
And misfortune that was coming my way
Death foretold as the story unfolds
Nothing will emerge from here alive
Middle of nowhere
Nothing to hold on
A cry for help was never enough to save me

In my eyes Iâve been redeemed
It takes a setback to visualise the changes to the world (darkness all around)
The curtain starts to fall
Hell froze over
The battle has just begun
Iâll march towards the sun
With uncertainty and anger inside

Zero below the sun
Iâm a zero below the sun
Zero below the sun
Is all Iâll ever be

Fading away in the starless night
Iâve fallen from grace
Neon lights awaiting me
Before the rising of the sun
I waste my life on the plains of sorrow
Somewhere in the distance
A voice whispers me to the light

Resurrected by a newborn star
Until the day when death unites
I feel so isolated
One step from devastation
There is no turning back
Crimson sun sets on the earth
I ask myself
Should I trust my instincts now

All those years of insignificance
Roll the dice
Become the catalyst
The days are long and nights unending
I canât see
The eclipse is blinding
Closing in with the fast approaching storm
Will you be forever by my side
Far from vanity
Escape from agony
Hanging onto life with grim dissatisfaction

I have reached the pinnacle of life
Iâve conquered new heights
I have the will to resist the power of the universe
And I wonât deny the glory is mine
Lay your trust in me until weâre out of sight

Fading away in the starless night
Iâve fallen from grace
Neon lights awaiting me
Before the rising of the sun
The day has come and Iâm the last one standing
The leap of faith
Anticipating the fall
