Born on the wings of darkness
Forever lost, concealed in time
The day which shone, yet fell so grim
Death, heartache, endless suffering
Lost in a dream, so hard to see
Life he lived, but strived to be
Something more than what's been before
A greater art, a shining force

Darkness!
Shadows of life fly by in the sky
Evil prevails light
Riders of night, betrayal of sin
Immortal souls once stood proud to kin
Forlorn faces, final traces
A thousand years of fire
Not afraid of what lies ahead
Not afraid to die, to signal the end

As he flies enchanted lines
Fallen stars have scarred the skies
His epic journey has begun
To overturn the dark lords sun
He is strong, yet weak inside
Too many years have slowed his mind
Unbeknownst to him, he will have to pay
For darkness reigns in the black of day

Darkness!
Shadows of life fly by In the sky
Evil rules the light
Riders of night, Betrayal of sin
Immortal souls once stood proud to kin
They thought they could take him
Nothing could ever break him
Prepare to taste the steel
The unforgiving sky reveals

Now the wings of terror are clipped
and the longing sense of hate is gone
Blocking paths, for the newer breed
Once doomed, never to succeed
The state I've left, can never be seen
