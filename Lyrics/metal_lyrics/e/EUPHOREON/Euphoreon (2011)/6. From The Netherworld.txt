Craving for more we deny our inner greed
A lifetime condemned to slavery
Starving salvation, treachery
My thoughts are clouded on the path to

Insanity drives us to deeds we would never dream
Tears apart the very essence of our being
We'll travel paths unknown
Wander fields of gold
Is this what we desire tonight?
In the black and cold, we are light
Through skyline's so frail, we shine
Freezing winds blow stronger
Our withering hope is over

I dream my life away
What I've seen belies reality
This world is too vain
I wish to leave it all behind
Nothing more remains undreamed
Will we escape this hell of ours
Dreaming of the Netherworld

I close my eyes and see
A world without meaning
You can't save me now
Let me go, I'm drowning

The higher we climb the further we fall
Promised lands have failed us all
Burdens hanging around my neck
We're following a blind deceiver

Endless trails lead us round and down again
We grow weary of this numb existence
Resenting the games we're forced to play
Struggling for our own identity
We must obey and conquer (as we fall)
As we fall so ever deeper (where to go)
Where have we left to go?
What more can't we control?
Is this the end of the world we know
The dawn of an age to come so cold
With pure hatred, we cross the line
We will never return

I dream my life away
What I've seen belies reality
This world is too vain
I wish to leave it all behind
Heading for a world undreamed
Finally escape this hell of ours
Now I see the Netherworld

We gave our lives to see
The world inside our dreams
Now this dream will end
A dying light
The harder we tried the further we fell into strife
Into cauldrons black as night
It burned me inside, and swallowed all of my time
It burned me inside, and ruined all I desire
