Let the heavens bleed
We hunt for reverence not greed
From heaven we angels fell
Banished to the kingdom of hell
Holy war wages strong
Mankind stands and looks on
Loyalties meaningless
Our faith in you it now turns to dust
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
Mankind shall face our wrath
Their burning souls light our path
Blood shall cover the land
Sentenced devastation on our command
Guard your heavens gate
You'll fall regardless of fate
We'll take back what is ours
Paradise forever ruled by our hand
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
