A dead dawn's mist, unearthly cries
From shallow earth the cursed rise
A life of death broke and decayed
They walk again to bleed the day

Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead

The periled souls have gained new birth
They march again to reap the earth
Desecration, darkest times
The living suffer for their crimes

Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead

Trapped by terror, hopeless plea's
Last prayer to none, fall to your knees
Save one bullet for the end
On bitter peace you can depend

Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The living dead
