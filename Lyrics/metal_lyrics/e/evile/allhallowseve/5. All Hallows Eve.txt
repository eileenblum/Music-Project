The thirteenth strike
The demons come out to play
The witching hour
They hunt for flesh, the prey
All hallows eve
The dead shall rise once more
Hell unleashed
This evil beats down your door
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control

Start to sweat
The blood runs cold in your veins
Afraid to move
Fear takes hold of the reins
On this night
Your loved ones return like before
Run for your life
Your loved ones themselves no more
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
