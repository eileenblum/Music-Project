Watching over savage grounds
Within his laws, you are bound
Pulling strings, he makes your every move
Bodies mark your path to take
In these fields you'll not awake
Cut down, your final place of rest
In this world he calls his own
The loss begins, the seed is sown
The futile battle for your life and soul
Stalking through an unknown land
Your life is taken by his hand
No one can escape the god below
The skies turn red and wait to fall
Dawn of destruction, await its call
To darkest black this land falls to its knees
Do or die his only words
Say your prayers, can they be heard?
In the chaos you find that you are lost
