Paralysed, cannot move at all
From the imminent strike of the beast
From the depths of hell, the deep blue sea
The demon has come for the feast
Attack is swift, attack is fast
Life flashes before your eyes
When the devil strikes there's nowhere to hide
All around shall hear your cries

With crippling pain, blood spills from your veins
Its time to face your demise
A thousand knives ripping through your flesh
Through your blood the beast shall rise
In the jaws of the killer your blood starts to flow
Salvation is all that you seek
With every bite, the sea starts to change
Your blood shall stain the sea red

Servant of death
Killer from the deep
Your final breath
Death you shall reap
Eyes of black
And a heart made of stone
Shark attack
You've entered the killing zone
