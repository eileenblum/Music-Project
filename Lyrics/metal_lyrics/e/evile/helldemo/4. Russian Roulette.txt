One in six
Forced to die
Barrel to skull
Despair in eye
Finger on trigger
Showers of sweat
Eyes fixed on him
They've all made their bet

Chamber of death unknown
Silence becomes your home
Testing the execution
Russian roulette

Down in the pit
Waiting to die
Turn soon to come
Terror makes you numb
Taken to the chair
Deadly game unfolds
Five shots at life
One shot to death

Chamber of death unknown
Silence becomes your home
Testing the execution
Russian roulette
