Blood, on the sand
Where the gladiators stand
Thunder, from the gods
Who deal in the fate of man

Hail Caesar
Those about to die
By the turn of his hand
Commit your blood to the sand

Roar, from the masses
As they bay for blood to run
Hail! Caesar stands
To bring this game of death to life

Hail Caesar
Those about to die
By the turn of his hand
Commit your blood to the sand

Silence, a warrior stands
With an axe held in both hands
Hail! Caesar stands
All eyes fixed on his hand
