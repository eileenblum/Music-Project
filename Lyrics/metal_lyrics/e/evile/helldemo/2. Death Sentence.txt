Jury, sentenced me to death
My twisted memories are all I have left
Left to rot in a cold empty cell
The people judged I should burn in hell
I pray for mercy but it won't come
Ten thousand volts my life is done
An empty shell, a dead man walking
All I hear are the voices talking

You're strapped in
Draw your final breath
You're strapped in
Sentenced to death

Salvation, of my empty dreams
The flames of hell shall imprison me
People grin as I'm strapped to the chair
The padre speaks the final prayer
A family grieves their loved ones last breath
Their dreams are haunted by the visions of death
A heartless killer, that's all they see
In their memories I'll be free

You're strapped in
Draw your final breath
You're strapped in
Sentenced to death

Capital punishment
No escape from what I've done
No redemption
I can't pretend
Flick of the switch
Now's the end

Revenge, of my death so sweet
My soul shall kneel before the demons feet
I've paid the price for my unholy sins
But in the darkness the nightmare begins
Its time to face the god almighty
In the darkness the light shall bind me
Can't escape the reality
All I see is blood wash over me

You're strapped in
Draw your final breath
You're strapped in
Sentenced to death

Sentenced to death
Sentenced to death
