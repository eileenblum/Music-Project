The trespass I have committed
The distant sun and the storm are witness to what I've brought you through
There's nothing else left to save
I've taken all else but blame
I've left you with a tortured view

Never the same
Descent into madness
Seasons enslaved
A new fixation
Wakened from slumber I show you just what obsession offers
Greater the forces that push you to make
Your descent into madness

Surfaced again for air
In seas of torment I cleanse
Await my reward, the chance to redeem
Release from the unseen creatures
Everything's not as it seems
Reality not the same as the dream

Damned are the unfortunate
Branded as the guilty
Into their madness descend

Descend into madness
Descent into madness

Damned are the unfortunate
Branded as the guilty
Into their madness descend
