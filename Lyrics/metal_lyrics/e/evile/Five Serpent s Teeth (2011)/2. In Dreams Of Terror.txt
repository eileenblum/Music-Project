In dreams of terror leave me be
Look straight at me
As near you fear to stand
Questions, answers I have all in hand
Confused, Unwanted your universe becomes
Our obsession our deeper curse

From beyond us
Dealing madness
Only rising to breathe
The horrors
Illusions
Infinity to be
You have to let me free

Movement lurking deeper down it leads
Make it live I keep it here with me
In dreams of terror leave me be

Share your thoughts
Be they fixed on birth or death
Learnings, teachings, a purging breath
Careless reasons for words we have obeyed
Far sight into what distant lays

From beyond us
Dealing madness
Only rising to breathe
The horrors
Illusions
Infinity to be
You have to let me free

Am I hearing the voice of reason?
Let me save myself
Let me suffer, my way

Terror
Unleashed the nameless descending
Promised released to mystify
Horror
Thoughts of what must be inside me
Deliver the oath to keep me alive

This tomb animated unaware it calls
Drifting further beyond us all
Beware they hold the darkest discipline
Cutting deepest where the virtue thins

From beyond us
Dealing madness
Only rising to breathe
The horrors
Illusions
All this is real

Real terror
Ancients awake
Let knowing that which I take

Movement lurking deeper down it leads
Make it live I keep it here with me
In dreams of terror leave me be
