When the darkness takes from me
Cruel hands are scorned
How our light dims carelessly
Bringing bare minds torn

Come with me
When the darkness comes
We all must leave
When the darkness comes

Sifting through my memories
Lifting spirits once more
Ones we lose forever breathe
Through the past reborn

Come with me
When the darkness comes
We all must leave
When the darkness comes

Wasted seasons surround us
Take not for granted your time
Such a thing waits for no man
Stone gardens stand before us
Lifelong the memoirs always rhyme
Try to live before one dies

Come with me
When the darkness comes
We all must leave
When the darkness comes
