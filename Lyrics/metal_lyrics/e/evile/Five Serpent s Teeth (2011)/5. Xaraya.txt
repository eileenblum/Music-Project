Left always to be among others needs
Please someone hear my cries
Just who will see that I long to be
No partner in misery?
No, never she hears, mother I call
Curse she has said
So self aware, the habit she wears
Sedation before a care

I breathe deep
Inviting sleep
I beg
Save me and take me home

How we all soon forget
Born another vague regret
All I ever wish to be
Buried in my screams
Dehumanized
Dehumanized

This world I never wanted
For this world I never asked

Eyes opened to sin, a struggle begins
Wherever was the choice?
Are these the ones I trust upon?
They canât even save themselves
My fortune in doubt, living without
Life within self
Others the same accepted in shame
A cycle without an end.

I breathe deep
Inviting sleep
I beg
Save me and take me home

How we all soon forget
Born another vague regret
All I ever wish to be
Buried in my screams
Dehumanized
Dehumanized

This world I never wanted
For this world I never asked

I never knew, I never saw
Given no choice to bear a voice
Prisoner in a empty life
No one can see until too late

The winds of black will sweep me up
And take me back to where I know
The only thing in my control
Is I can be one more lost soul

For this world I never wanted
For this world I never asked
I breathe deep
Invite sleep
I am dehumanized
