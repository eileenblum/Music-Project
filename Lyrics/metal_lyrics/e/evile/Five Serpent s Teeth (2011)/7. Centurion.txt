I guard the great dominion
State and realm I honour first
Fear me, the great protector
Strength waiting the perfect curse

Prepare
Prepare for war

I give orders, obey
I live for glory of the powerful legion
And nothing more
I am Centurion
(One of the gods)
The warrior
(Defy the hordes)
Superior
I am Centurion

Break dawn with screaming soldiers
Crash through mists with demon eyes
Death hunt near a hundred rising
Tread towards the troubled skies
Stare down the great immortals
They release their darkest force
Hold now prepare for warfare
Surge the power from its source

Prepare
Prepare for war

I give orders, obey
I live for glory of the powerful legion
And nothing more
I am Centurion
(One of the gods)
The warrior
(Defy the hordes)
Superior
I am Centurion

Strike for blood across the fields
Claim my real gain
Meet my foes with sword and shield
Fear my eternal name

I give orders, obey
I live for glory of the powerful legion
And nothing more
I am Centurion
(One of the gods)
The warrior
(Defy the hordes)
Superior
I am Centurion

Centurion
