Breaking beyond the path
Betrayer of my thoughts
Thereâs no way to stop
This venomous shot
Intentions become remorse
My blood electric with
Desire to smash restrain
As measured in blood
Still punishment should
Come to the one unnamed

Serpents connected
Potent and set to kill
Serpents perfected
Settle the scores one by one

Gathered for the revolution
Fortunes ever intertwined
One of these Five Serpentâs Teeth
I save for you

Complete the coil we set
Where buried the sorrowed crown
Stand off and face
A point blank embrace
Thereâs no other way but down
Waiting before the sign
With anger the chambers inject
Find clearer sights
Disorder ignite
The spiraling law protects

Serpents connected
Potent and set to kill
Serpents perfected
Settle the scores one by one

Realize, isolation
Take your place
Terminate, by formation
Reveal your guilt
Manifest, retribution
You served yourself
Demonstrate, evolution

This world will one day break you
To show you yourself so we may see
What lies beneath the mask you wear
To cover yourself to deceive

Born unto greed
Living to deceive

Lay the coins on dead men's eyes
Malevolence
Hide no more

Gathered for the revolution
Fortunes ever intertwined
One of these Serpentâs Teeth
I save for you
I save for you
One of these Serpentâs Teeth
I save for you.
