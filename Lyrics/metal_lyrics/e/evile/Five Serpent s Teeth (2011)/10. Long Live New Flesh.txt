Long live the new flesh!
Long live the new flesh!

Why must they destroy what they cannot understand?
Imprisoned dreams are further slipping through old hands
Ruler of the world alone becoming something never known
What's real the void will terrify

Infamy it will occur, be always seen and ever heard
In disbelief you will remember

Long live the new flesh!
Long live the new flesh!

Passages of time blurring ever changing lines
Visions of temptation, the destroyer awaits the sign
Empathy a solemn weight for captive thought within the gates
A stain of mind with no reprieve
Curious the mind aware delivered of inhuman cares
In disbelief you will remember

Long live
New flesh
Long live
New flesh

Misgivings
No control
Dark secrets
Long live new flesh

Long live the mind possessed
Long live the one request
Long live the new flesh
Replace the man before
Resolve uneven scores
Protect the clear law

Long live the new flesh

Reinforce, become aware
Separate, within I stare
Cure me of unrest
Conceive the outcome
Mirror be undone

Long live the mind possessed
Long live the one request
Long live the new flesh
Replace the man before
Resolve uneven scores

Long live the new flesh!
