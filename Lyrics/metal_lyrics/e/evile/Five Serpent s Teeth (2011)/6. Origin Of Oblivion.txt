Release my sense awareness
Dead to the world, we still have connection
Become one with the structure
Looking on their projections
Soon to be moving forward
Our foresight has always been so blind
Answer calls universal
Listen to that you find

Swallowed by blame
Subconscious reclaimed
I wander this earth regained

I am witness to all creation
Origin of oblivion
You are warned

Abandon all hope, he who enters
Suffer the pains that be
Abandon all hope, he who enters
Death becomes machine

Bound as servants we would be
I will never become machine

Beware for gone is the order
Even when they promise to protect you
Destroy me to revive me
Replace cause to become new
Reason with hell and rapture
Give to the world a measure of decay
Never be as my visions
Still minutes fall away

Swallowed by blame
Subconscious reclaimed
I wander this earth regained

I am witness to all creation
Origin of oblivion
You are warned

Abandon all hope, he who enters
Suffer the pains that be
Abandon all hope, he who enters
Death becomes machine

What you seek you'll find
Where the unreal meets the skies
If only you could see what I've seen
With your eyes

Bound as servants we would be
I will never become machine
More than human we could be
I will never become machine

Swallowed by blame
Subconscious reclaimed
I wander this earth regained

Abandon all hope, he who enters
Death becomes machine

Become machine

I will never become machine
I will never become machine
I will never become machine
I will never become machine
I will never become machine
I will never become machine
