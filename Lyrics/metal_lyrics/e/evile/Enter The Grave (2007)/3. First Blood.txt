Vietnam veteran
Memories of atrocity
Trained killing machine
With no place in society
Incarceration
With no justification
Of law deprived
Escape to survive

First blood
Search and destroy
A fugitive from the law
Unaware they're hunting
A one man war

Master of combat
Rivalled by none
Silent hunter
New war begun
Violent ambush
Fierce fast attack
Fighting injustice
No turning back

To survive war
You must become war

Ex green beret
Shown no remorse
Swift brutal vengeance
On a lawless force
Fearless survivor
Haunted by horrors within
Retaliation
To a war he cannot win
