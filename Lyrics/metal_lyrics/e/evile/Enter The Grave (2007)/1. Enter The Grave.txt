Craving screams to satisfy
Feel the need within
Thrill of the hunt, thrill of the kill
Roam the night again
Mists of dark he leaves the mark
A life is his tonight
Live for death, kill for life
Insanity brings them down

Violent premonitions of the death
Butchered and maimed
Enter the grave

The hunt begins for end to life
To bury in shallow earth
Knife in hand, cut the throat
Bleed the victim dry
Lifeless eyes stare through the soil
Into the killers soul
The gathered dead prey on his mind
Should the death be his own?

Violent premonitions of the death
Butchered and maimed
Enter the grave

The craving scream is satisfied
The hunt begins again
The voices rage a soul's unrest
The killing need consumes
Mists of dark, he leaves his mark
A life is his tonight
Live for death, kill for life
Insanity brings him down

Violent premonitions of the death
Butchered and maimed
Violent premonitions of the death
Butchered and maimed
Enter the grave
