Gagged and bound
To the post of execution
Condemned to this fate
I face incineration
Watched upon with torment
Expectant of demise
Touched upon by evil
To disorder I gave rise

Held up high
To expose my incrimination
Innocence I proclaim
With frantic desperation
Seeker of ruination
Conjure the spirits of the dead
Darkness will consume the earth
Rivers will run red

I vow to return

Burned alive
Burned alive
Burned at the stake

Gathered for the flames
Consuming fascination
Masked executioner
Crazed anticipation
Judgment extermination
Heat begins to rise
I will not repent
Defiance in my eyes

I vow to return

Burned alive
Burned alive
Burned at the stake

Burned at the stake
Evil will not die
Burned at the stake
Send me straight to hell

Lost in hell
I swear retaliation
Servant of suffering
I pledge my dedication
Vengeance on those who sought
To end my rule of pain
Fire will be their judge
Burning skies will rain

I vow to return

Burned alive
Burned alive

Burn!
