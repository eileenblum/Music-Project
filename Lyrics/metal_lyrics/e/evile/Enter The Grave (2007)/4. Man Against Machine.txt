Societies collapse
End of days begins
Men and women young and old
Fight a war they cannot win
Democracy in ruin
Battling in vain
End of modern era
Tyranny rules again

Man against machine
Hunger in its eyes
Man against machine
Killing through the lies

Wake up to the nightmare
Innocent legions fall
Rich or poor strong or weak
Iron fist crushes all
Indiscriminate killing
Reasons unknown for years
Pleas and screams for mercy
Falling on deafened ears

On and on it rolls
Taking apart the weak
Designed to terminate
Killing as they sleep
Crushing as it moves
Nothing does it need
Indiscrimination
Fuelled by pure greed

Political assassins
Blood falls on the lands
Violence in black and white
While money changes hands
Keep the fires burning
Fighting to the last
Objective: new beginning
Concept hard to grasp

Man against machine
Hunger in its eyes
Man against machine
Killing through the lies
Man against machine
Hunger in its eyes
Man against machine
Profit through demise
