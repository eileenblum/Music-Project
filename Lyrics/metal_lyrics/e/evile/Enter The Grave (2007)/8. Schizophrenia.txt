Frantic personality
Twisted dance of despair
No grasp on reality
Of the voices beware
Grotesque mental images
Burning in the mind
Breaking down, shattered pieces
Chains of madness bind

Hellish voices multiply
Distort and report to the mind

Schizophrenia
Splitting of the mind

Psychotic delusional
Beliefs are not your own
Violent harsh illusions
Affliction unknown
Extreme paranoia
Irrational distrust
Merciless destroyer
Existence starts to rust

Hellish voices multiply
Distort and report to the mind

Schizophrenia
Splitting of the mind
No end to paranoia
Disorder, disease
Schizophrenia

Trapped in psychosis
At you they stare
Trusting no one
But no one's there

Thoughts of persecution
Everyone's out to kill
They want your execution
Your skull they want to drill
Destructive phobia
Suspicion tears you apart
Fragmented poisoned view
Your decline they start

Hellish voices multiply
Distort and report to the mind

Schizophrenia
Splitting of the mind
No end to paranoia
Disorder, disease
Schizophrenia
