Thunder through the darkness
The curse of war to come
An armoured force invading
Serenities undone
Disciples of pure hatred
Like lightning they attack
They carry a torch of evil
The flame that burns is black

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun

Cities burn in flames
Only ruins will remain
Blood stains the earth
Defenders fight in vain
Crushing all before them
With metal armoured might
Futile prayers for mercy
Unanswered in the fight

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun

Locked in bitter conflict
Let devastation begin
The iron fist of evil
Condemns you and your kin
Destruction of subhuman race
Innocents shall die
The plague of war corrupts the earth
They're fighting for a lie

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun
