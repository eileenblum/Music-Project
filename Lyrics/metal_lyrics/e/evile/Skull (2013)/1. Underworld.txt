No sight of the journey's end
A place where the weaker dread
Condemned to remain forever
Across earth oblivion spreads

Crushing the world we built
With power and focused will
The death we created detached
Our reach had exceeded our grasp

Fight to be set free
From suffocating needs
Witness to new ways
Layers under earth
Discovering our worth
Our eternal maze
Through the underworld

A whisper of life all that's left
The forces have shown contempt
Pushed by human nature
The sword hangs above our head

Dethroned are the ways of old
Defied and left breathing cold
Sentenced to covered chambers
We rebuild our broken world

Fight to be set free
From suffocating needs
Witness to new ways
Layers under earth
Discovering our worth
Our eternal maze
Through the underworld

Living in ruins
Buried beneath
Haunting and timeless
Embrace our release
Under the world
We seek sensing the deep
Back to the dawn
Further we crawl
Under the world
Under the world
