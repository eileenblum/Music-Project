Can you take what I want to give
A gift that crawls with life anew
Thereâs much more that I see in you
Than an open door to walk through

Close your eyes
Surrender
I breathe your sighs
Consuming you
Strong release
Controlling thoughts
Take my time
In breaking you

When you dream its me that you fear
You already know what you become
When you wake itâs me that you see
You already know
What youâve become is mine

In the view of those watching eyes 
Trust not a thing in what they see
In the dark perception can shift
Youâll see me as Iâm meant to be

Close your eyes
Surrender
I breathe your sighs
Consuming you
Strong release
Controlling thoughts
Take my time
In breaking you

When you dream its me that you fear
You already know what you become
When you wake itâs me that you see
You already know
What youâve become is mine

Mine
Mine
What you've become is mine
