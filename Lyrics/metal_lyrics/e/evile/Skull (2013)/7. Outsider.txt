Born a curse somewhere out of sight
Lost beings have cared for my needs
Years have passed me by
Another being has never been seen
Labyrinth, undying solitude
I pictured myself set free
I made a vow to one day rise
From the broken existence I lead

I am the outsider
Outsider
Escape and behold the day
Outsider
Unswayed by what the world will say

Breaking through layers of my cell
Upon the hallowed ground I now stand
I meet the glare of the beast
But the horror makes no demand
Terror stares in its form, unknown
In the golden arch itâs framed
Beckoning I touch the glass
The terror and I are the same

I am the outsider
Outsider
Escape and behold the day
Outsider
Unswayed by what the world will say
Outsider
Forward into the wild domain
Outsider
Unknown forever to remain

Frantic I crave the light
For I know not who I am
Voiceless I canât relate
To the ones I once belonged

I am the outsider
Outsider
Escape and behold the day
Outsider
Unswayed by what the world will say
