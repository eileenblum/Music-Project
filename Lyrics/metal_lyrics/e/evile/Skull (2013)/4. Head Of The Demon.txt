Ancient deceiver
Creeping forward through the land
Age old curse of centuries
Moving silently across the sand
Once seen as immortal
Evidently as it stalks
Far too long the people wait
For the blood red sun 
As thousands warned

Bring me the head
The scriptures say it will be so
Bring me the head of the demon

Daylight a memory
Only whispered to return
Shades of death
Have come to life
To remind us power must be earned
Faithful the keepers
And the ritual they believed
By the dawn the demon comes
And they see the child for which they grieve

Bring me the head
The scriptures say it will be so
Bring me the head of the demon
Bring me the head
We pray beneath the blood red sun
Bring me the head of the demon

Feeding on faith of the helpless
Leaving them more than the hand of fate

Bring me the head
The scriptures say it will be so
Bring me the head of the demon
Bring me the head
We pray beneath the blood red sun
Bring me the head of the demon
Bring me the head
The head of the demon
