These visions are haunting me
Iâve nowhere left to run
I carry the weight of guilt
For the things Iâve done

Temptation led me down
I found the pages cold
Aloud I read the words
Summoning spirits old
Old

I severed the ties that bind
The afterlife has claimed
Forgive me for what Iâve done
With madness face to face

I read the blood scrolls
Time has left behind
I wanted to bring them back
But to consequence Iâm blind

Speak the words of the dead
Speak with me
Words of the dead
Sorrow to be
Words of the dead
Delusion made real
Words of the the dead
Speak now and reveal

Those words are burned onto my cruel tongue
Intention, well meaning, has been undone
Fierce warnings are turning inside my head
As we chant the fateful words of the dead

Summoned from the bound writings
Summoned awaken from slumber
Join us like others before you
Join us one by one we will take you

Words of the dead
Speak with me
Words of the dead
Sorrow to be
Words of the dead
Delusion made real
Words of the the dead
Speak now and reveal

Words of the dead
Words of the dead
Words of the dead
