Take whatâs pure
Remain secure
Supreme behind glory they hide
Give no more
Enslaved ignored
What we once believed in is dead and gone

New truths
Immortal disguise
New truths
Serve only old lies

Life laid down
In chains and bound
A victim of darkening times
Speech confused
Freedom refused
Behold every word ringing false to all

New truths
Immortal disguise
New truths
Serve only old lies

Wealth all they seek
Freedom taken while we sleep
Trapped underneath
Reason staying unrevealed
Hell living free
Injustice for what might have been
Change in our grasp
Becoming what they cannot see

How do we see what waits ahead
To their ambition weâre blind
How do we trust an empires fate
To those in who conviction expired

New truths
Immortal disguise
New truths
Serve only old lies

Break the game
Restart, reclaim
The liberties taken revealed
One and all
Corrupt control
The boundaries are set to consume
The soul
