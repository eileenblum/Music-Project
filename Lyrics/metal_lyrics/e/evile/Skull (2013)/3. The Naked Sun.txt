Welcome to judgment
The trial under the sun
Night never descends
The eye sees all thatâs done
Judgement
New fear
Froze beneath the surface there to stay
Confined
The genesis of multiplied decay

We can be born again
Eyes open wide
Now crawl outside
Honesty in what you need
Just bare your soul
All should rise in the naked sun

Always in absence 
You creep under the ground
World within a world
And moving ever down
Divided 
New fear
Froze beneath the surface there to stay
Confined
The genesis of multiplied decay

We can born again
Eyes open wide
Now crawl outside
Honesty in what you need
Just bare your soul
All should rise in the naked sun

Distant are the secrets 
Hidden from the gaining light
In myth we see the motive
So enchanting upon sight

Guilty as faithful
To ways youâve always known
Time never stands
Still enough to overthrow

We can be born again
Eyes open wide
Now crawl outside
Honesty in what you need
Just bare your soul
All should rise in the naked sun
