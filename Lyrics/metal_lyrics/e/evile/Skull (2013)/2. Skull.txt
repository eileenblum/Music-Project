Skull awaits your soul

Taken to the edges of the void
To see a universe in great division
The living and the dead are now one
Wrapped up in a state of pure transition
Searching for the answers never told
Circling around the unvoiced questions
In the grip of panic pulled apart
Grasping at the fabric of existence

Dark words are spoken as the fear creates itself
Weaker minds are dreaming of deceit
Looking much deeper as we pass into the abyss
We wonder how we still exist
Skull awaits your soul

Distant is the line not to be crossed
Holding back the hidden world invaders
Destiny has cast an eye on you
Knowing what you see invites delusion
Once you see the light no turning back
Power of a thousand suns compelling
Can you feel them turning in your mind
Thatâs the guild of all the damage rising

Step to the edge to begin your trial
Regret descends to take you to exile

In-between awake and dream not knowing where to turn
Seek the place of demons where they show you what they yearn
Hypnotized by images of every path you take
All your senses struggle with the dark side now awake

Skull
Pulled in deeper swallowed whole
Skull
Demons hunger for your soul

Heading for the gate created by immortal minds
Twisting through unending space and time
Searching for a way to free the crushing weight of doubt
Many take the easiest way out
Skull awaits your soul

Soon to reach the point of no return
They will not relent until they break you
Keep your mind on whatâs laid out ahead
Longing for redemption far overdue
Try to get beneath fierce beliefs
Take a leap of faith and find your meaning
Great is the decision that you face
Once you see the purpose of your making

Dark words are spoken as the fear creates itself
Weaker minds are dreaming of deceit
Looking much deeper as we pass into the abyss
We wonder how we still exist
Skull awaits your soul
Skull awaits your soul
