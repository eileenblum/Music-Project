[Bonus track]

Scower helping hands
The aid in chase I crave
Remedy the prowl for
A hindrance of due grace

Living bounded
Shifting enduring guard
Follower, evasion absurd

Hunt for the fight
To kill my parasite

Demon eternal
Anticipate
In danger
Myself I concentrate

Living bounded
Shifting enduring guard
Follower, evasion absurd

Hunt for the fight
To kill my parasite

Parasite
If dies the keeper
Parasite
The sycophant's demise

Living bounded
Shifting enduring guard
Follower, evasion absurd

Hunt for the fight
To kill my parasite

Parasite
Parasite
Parasite
Kill my parasite
