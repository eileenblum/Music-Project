Changing out the face you wear
Turning from the guilty stares
Listen to the fables you tell
You're giving the game away
Aren't you ever man enough
To face your consequence
Did the fire burn too bright
So you launch more offence
Thought
Devoid of thought
Devoid of thought
Fiction crossing in with fact
Caught up in creation's frame
Honestly, the greater act
You're too far to go back
Wanting not the world you walk
Living in the one that's made
Negative a positive
For your weak masquerade
Thought
Devoid of thought
Devoid of thought
Devoid of thought
Devoid of thought
Come forth with the truth
Come forth
Be who you are
Not who you want
Be who you are
Not who you want
Devoid of thought
