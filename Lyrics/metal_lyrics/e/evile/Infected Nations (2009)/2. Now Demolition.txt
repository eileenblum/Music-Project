On the path to lose his mind
His punishment in sight
Face the man on the other side
Keep hidden thought with rhyme

Take vengeance where all the guilty you find

Demolition
Demolition
Now demolition
Demolition now

Searching blind for answers near
Nightmares reveal to thee
Scores of watchers over see
Where secrets dare not be

Look behind the eyes that see past time
Take vengeance where all the guilty you find

Demolition
Demolition
Now demolition
Demolition now

From the void they take the stars
They rip and tear him down
In his eyes they steal the sky
He'll never wear his crown

Take vengeance where all the guilty you find

Demolition
Demolition
Now demolition
Demolition now

Demolition
Demolition
