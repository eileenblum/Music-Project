[Music by Evile, lyrics by Matt Drake]

From the skies I see a rising storm
A problem breed of thoughtless born
Aggression runs along the lines
Influence pushes the mass design
Infected nation
A faulted creation
Show us salvation
Infected nation
I see our freedom taken
Powers that be have lost ascension
People buried in the walls
Knowledge will hold no power at all
Infected nation
A faulted creation
Show us salvation
Infected nation
All these creatures
Are blind to reason
Fear the day when
No one can stop them
Stop them
Infected nation
Infected nation
Infected nation
