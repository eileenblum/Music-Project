This haunted longing soul
Keep under lock and key
A straight line walked upon
passed over for his needs
Where finding nothing real
Wanting for nothing more
This mirror beckons closer
To show himself ignored
Brave the fall
Wolf you call
Time no more
This way you could take it all
Others climb to the sky
While monsters grip him tight
Chance is a faith unknown
It's driven deep from sight
Given a thousand keys
To open many doors
They could have healed his soul
There is no other cure
Brave the fall
Wolf you call
Time no more
This way you could take it all
Look into the staring void
Wake and curse yourself
Time to start another page
Chance may gift you change
Wasting all the breath you save
You lose it while you know
Life can heal every pain
Friend it's time you grow
Brave the fall
Wolf you call
Time no more
This way you could
Brave the fall
Wolf you call
Time no more
This way you could take it all
