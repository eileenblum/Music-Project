I search among the layers
Reaching beyond what lives out there
These trials I have to take
I tread the wild lands awake
I've been where others dwell
They know not where I go
Possessed by deeper sense
Eternal life a quest intense
So follow me
Far off the line
I'll lead you all
Into the light
Unending life
Throw yourself to the sun
Where you find you've become
Infinite eternal
Unknown land
Under the earth it sleeps
Tempting for those that it keeps
Inside the void it drives
Rising to open up and take alive
Throw yourself to the sun
Where you find you've become
Infinite eternal
Unknown land
Leave the cold hands of the past
Pressing strong and fast
Free myself from their hold
In warming light unfold
Turn, leave the line
Take the wheel, living
Breathing
Walk where no one stands guard
Fire walk with me
Further through, growing
Being
From roots we touch the sky
