Drag me down
Depths I dread
Where I pass million dead
Conflict wraps me in waves
To show kings and slaves

Sinking deep as I find
Just was lurks in there minds
Let me go as I rise
I hold no more life inside

I have seen through others eyes
Such things I fear to see with mine
Vision of a future denied
Pull me away from genocide

Staring down the face of time
Far I drift through the lines
More I see morbid ways
Down I cannot stay

Try and surface from the truth
As it's pulling down on you
All these demons we detest
The demons are
These demons are only men

I have seen through others eyes
Such things I fear to see with mine
Vision of a future denied
Pull me away from genocide

I held my breath I was pulled below
From the earth that I wanted for
These hands that hold
Press me to the past
Are the same that bring
Me back from the dead

I have seen through others eyes
Such things I fear to see with mine
Vision of a future denied
Pull me away from genocide

Genocide
Genocide
Genocide
Genocide

These demons are only men
