Take the world by the throat for pleasure
Ask forgiveness not once
Are you sat on enough possession
Living with what tempts you

Would you give for the mountains you made
Wealth is all in your eyes
From here I see even in peace
You find a way to war

Plague to end all plagues
Plague to end all plagues
The plague to end all

Turning fast far below the skin
Greed demands that you rise
Never trust the man who seeks power
Loyalty comes at a price

As you gain from another's misfortune
More ideals turn to sand
Try deny power breeds corruption
With the stains on your hands

Plague to end all plagues
Plague to end all plagues
The plague to end all
Plague to end all

Plague to end all plagues
Plague to end all plagues

Plague to end all plagues
Plague to end all plagues
The plague to end all
The plague to end all
