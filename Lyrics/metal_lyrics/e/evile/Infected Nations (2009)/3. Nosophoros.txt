Far beyond our grasp
Within eyes burn with hate
Blinding appetite
With a lust to separate
Striking at the line
Preaching from a hollow throne
Scarring humankind upon poisoned words they've grown

Strength we need
Seeking peace

Denied of the choice
Of who they are to become
Need to educate
So all the wrongs can be undone
Hiding underground
Face deep in disguise
Misguiding all the young
Seems that elders aren't so wise

Strength we need
Seeking peace

Strong will be our pride
Pushing on without divide
Look how far we've come
Ever closer to one mind

Strong we'd be
No divide
Ever closer
To one mind

Are we caught in madness?
Still no complete union
Some are walking madness
Stood in the way of progress

Strong we'd be
No divide
Ever closer to one mind
