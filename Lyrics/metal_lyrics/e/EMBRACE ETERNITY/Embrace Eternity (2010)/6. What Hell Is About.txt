[Verse:]
Wake me when tomorrow is over
I cant stand the thought of my life
Tell me when the night is sober
Walk me like the carpet I am

Dodge these bullets get hit and fall
All this light will build a wall
Rise again and step up the pace
Count those times through bitter end of days

My ears bleeding at the sound of your name
The criticism I get means I am to blame
Creeping out the cracks, everything has to change
I'm the dead one now, there is no energy

[Chorus:]
This is the time
This is the hour
We stand as one
Forever into the light
This is my hell

[Post Chorus:]
Blinded by my choices
Becoming what I hate
Clear the way so I can
Breathe again

[Verse:]
In the name of those who call
I know I gave it my all
Go ahead and cry another tear
Hiding away from all your fears

It tastes like the last kiss goodbye
Feeding the current to her eyes
Creeping through like the endless night
Only the poison can save us now

[Bridge:]

This is what hell is about
