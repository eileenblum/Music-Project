[Intro:]
Bridge the borders
Of this empty river
Untie the knots
And down we go

[Verse:]
Crawling out the woods
Straight into the fire
I like the look
Of the city at night

Above the heavens
The angels look down on me
I know I cannot
run from my past

Pull yourself together
Travel back in time
Commit to your mistakes
which have become crimes

I'm stuck in a dream
Cornered by these walls
Trying to get back over
The darkest unknown

[Pre-Chorus:]
WHAT WILL - be becoming of you
IF I - stab you in the heart
I KNOW - what dwells inside of you
THIS TIME - I focus on whats right

[Chorus:]
Lets go to the city
Lets go to the city at night
Lured by the sounds

Drawn to the light
Leave all your enemies
Bring only memories
Attracted to the light
The city at night

[Post-Chorus:]
The cries of my name
The hate, the anger again and again

[Verse:]
It was long ago
Taken from me, I will never know
Story of the legends
The battle between heavens

I will climb the heights
An opportunity to switch the lights
A revelation in the sky
My name she cries

Constantly divided
By the hole in our hearts
Never to fill as one again
Proving the soul is hollow

Change your opacity
To the colour of my blood
Forgotten history
To rid my mind of you

[Bridge:]
What has become of me?
I am not the same person anymore?
