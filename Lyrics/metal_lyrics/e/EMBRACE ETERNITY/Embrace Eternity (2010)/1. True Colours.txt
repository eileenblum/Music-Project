I'm running, down a stream of crystal clear blue water - YOU WONT SUCCEED
In an attempt to reach the dreams which dwindle before my eyes - BLINDED

I ask myself, how is it possible to accomplish so much in life - YOU HAVE NO ONE
When I have so little to offer to the world, and to the ones that I care for, respect and love  - WHATS THE POINT?

Now is the time I show my true colours
