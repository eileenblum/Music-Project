[Verse:]
The stench in the air is as ruthless as your mind.
Facing your demons is facing the devil himself.
Commit to your fate, the impotent will not defy you.
The Countless times you have been betrayed by your own

Death, creeps upon you, as you stand, at his side.
Kneel, at my feet, and I might spare your life.

[Verse:]
The innocent witness gazes as you hit the pavement.
Staring expressionless, your heart misses a beat.
Look to the masses but do not expect any answers
Disgraced and dismayed the face of the world is unveiled

Your skin, turns to white, as you feel, cold inside.
Be, not afraid, your soon to, depart - this life.

[Chorus:]
A god among men, yet still you cower,
Your people await your judgement
A god among men, yet still you cower,
Forsaken lies every word, you ever spoke

[Bridge:]
So pray, so beg, so plead for your life.
Its the last thing you own.
So pray, so beg, so plead that you may,
See the sun rise again, one last time
