[Verse:]
I wait slowly timing something that never will
I wait slowly fighting why does TIME STAND STILL
I keep all my hours inside you and me
I fight mighty power cant wait TILL I GET FREE

An explosion to the face make you realise
Destroyed in every single place nothing left to hide
End of our times are near means that we will die
Confide to all that's left time to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus:]
You and I
We will fight
Blood drawn swords
We will not lose

[Chorus:]
Who will come and save me before I die
Who will see the truth reflecting behind my eyes
Who will come and save us before we die
Who will turn their back on every in life

[Post-Chorus:]
Why I'm holding on oceans very strong
Cant get myself there drown in my own fear

[Verse:]
Something to blow your mind make you see all the violence
Kept away from time waiting to see true colours
The path we made is there don't you dwell on the past
Forget what lies within don't you under estimate me

[Pre-Chorus:]
Free to roam
Curse these hands
Fight for truth
Stand up for myself

[Bridge:]
I turn out all my rage
