[Verse:]
Remember the days we shared together
Now its all gone because of you throwing it away

[Chorus:]
Burn burn burn
Its all gone to the sky
Changing your name
To hide all the lies

Repeating the thoughts
I cannot die
Look inside my heart
These ties that bind

[Verse:]
Ek hou nie van die vel wat ek in is nie,
Maar ek dra dit met soveel trots as wat ek kan
Fear is its own
Kind of darkness
Your words don't mean
Anything here right now

[Bridge:]
Theres a gun
Pointed to my head
You have pulled
The trigger on me

[Verse:]
Dead in the beginning
The killer has no face
Time to bury the hatchet
The mystery remains

[Outro:]
Its time to pull yourself together
And understand that
You need to either
Focus on whats lost
Or fight for what is left
I don't understand how
You can just stand there
And not attempt to cry blood
I just want you to know that
That I can see inside your mind
Are you going to let me in
Are you going to let me in
Will you let me in
Or are you prepared to die
