Look ahead to the years
Realise what you desire
Hold your visions close for
Constant memories of this past life
Defeat, Devolve, Repeat, Resolve

[Verse:]
Distance, Fades away
And we become one - UNITE
To all, those who cant
Sleep or dream at night - UNITE

Who will take from our rights
Faded goals - death in sights
Stand your ground   take the hit
He who cant be told
I who cannot see
You don't believe in me
Courage I will throw
Into this hole

[Chorus:]
Slivers of light
They shine through me
They shine through you

[Verse:]
I destroy myself
To relive my past
Stuck in the beginning
The years disappear so fast

Like the heavy snow
Covering the ground
Layered by protection
That you never asked
I who cannot see
You don't believe in me
Will we see tomorrow
Into this hole I go

[Bridge:]
Constant Memories
Nothing will stand in my way
You wont stand in my way
