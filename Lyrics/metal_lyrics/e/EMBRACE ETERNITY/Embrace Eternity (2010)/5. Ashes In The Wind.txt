[Verse:]
We've traveled this road together my friend,
Hand in hand together until the very end.
This master plan we re searching for.
Two souls embraced so sweet for ever more.

[Chorus:]
Don t look back little girl
This path you chose  can only lead to your own demise
Don t look back little boy
That bridge you set alight is ashes in the wind

[Verse:]
Now the road forks and divides,
Two souls embraced never to re-unite.
