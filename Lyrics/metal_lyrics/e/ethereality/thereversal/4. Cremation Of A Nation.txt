Lying here, as my breath taints the sky. Did the idea of me die?
A ghost lying in the past, death follows where shadows are cast.

Surrounded by the pretenders, I will never surrender.
I will fight to exist, a human no more.

Pain sears through my wounds as gas is drenched upon my body.
People I saved point and they laugh, mock and spit on me.
I will never stop, I'll scream 'til the end.

Vision distorted, the smell won't fade. It's nauseating.
Stuck, I can't run, I suffocate. As I struggle to peer through the stinging ignition to my death.
I'll look you all in the eye, and whisper to thee: "Please don't tread on me." You won't tread on me.
