This world is fucking corrupt.

Can't you see? Obviously there is no one left with a little motherfucking basic common sense.
So we stand decisively. We must eliminate, then wipe the blood off the slate.
Disarm the masses. Establishing a new reign of global tyranny.

Clouded in mass secrecy, yet they claim transparency.
Why do we fail to ask why?
Hypnotized we're eating all their fabricated alibis.

Tonight we stop all of the gears to their machine, its end is near.
We the people will finally crack.
Gleaming semi-glossy black we've got the hammers clicked back.

Sometimes when I open my eyes, I wish they'd close forever!
I wish they'd close forevermore never to return.
Filled with rage, we've got a lesson they'll learn.
They underestimate, we'll leave them at a loss.
Put that gun to their head, as you take your fucking shades off.

We'll show them who the ones are that are actually strong.
We march at dusk, and we kill at dawn.
Propaganda: It's destroying your mind.
Their agenda will leave us dead and left behind.
