This is the only life we have now, or so they make it seem.
Our hands are too dirty, our sins are just too unclean.
The devil's advocate, I'll start the heresy.
I'll be the first to say there's more to you and there's more to me.
Programmed against each other, I swear there's a better way.
We need to see the light for hope to see another day.
Divide and and conquer. That's the name of their game.
My voice is reason, leaving your life forever changed.

Why do we lie?
Why do we steal?
Why do we maim?
Are you for real?

This is our nation, divided among the god's sons.
Social rankings exist in creation.
Leaving our land, no longer united as one.

We the people, begin the revolution.
It's in our veins, in our constitution.
Fighting commenced with our fists
Hell to the fields since 1776.

Welcome to a world of apathy.
Chained by greed, halted my man-made hell.
Your train of thought makes progression impossible.
Free your mind and our survival is possible.

"It's better to live one day as a lion, than a thousand years as a lamb."

Break down the walls.

Defiled by a lack of innocence.
Beguiled to a loss of tolerance.
My child how could you do this?

This is a path everyone will take.
It spares no sex, religion, culture, or race.

Gazing into the abyss, I see no light.
But that does not change what is wrong and what is right.
Sail beyond what you've been taught and reach for higher planes of thought.
This could be a world we'd all want to be born into.
