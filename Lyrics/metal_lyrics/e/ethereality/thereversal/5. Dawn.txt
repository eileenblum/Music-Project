This is the process: Dehumanization.
We are the victims, strangled under regulations.
Show me your tags, and papers please.
Blinded by fear, mindless philosophy.

So take fucking Congress and the Senate, and the president for every lie he's represented.
Expel them from their vile thrones. Pull them down, and burn their lavish homes.

Make them an example at dawn, chop their heads off on the White House lawn.
Make them pay for their wrongs. This is rebellion, the revolution song.

The Martial law takes control of the land.
The world as you know it is hanging on by a strand.
This is the time, it's up to you, you decide.
Will you rebel, or support freedom's genocide?

Exercise your amendment.
This second it's now or never. Our legacy will last forever.
So storm towards the White House. One shot. Don't choke, make it count.
Rewrite history, change everything.

The tyrants will fall with time.
