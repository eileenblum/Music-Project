(Concentrate on these words I have to say. You've been deceived. You've been lied to.
There is no democracy. Wake up.)

Admit one for freedom. The end of all light. Darkness on the horizon.
The sickness that lies inside me.
The sickness that lies inside you.
The sickness that lies inside them.
The sickness that will bring the end.

The vile crevice, necessary for social tension. Taken from the uneven beams of weighted justice.
Fools blinded by their own individualism. Eyes closed from our collective infrastructure.
Morals spawn from scripts instead of our own minds. Led by wolves in shepherds clothes.

We choose to sleep, sheltered in our own lives. What we don't know: Out of sight, out of mind.
The world we've created - imploding in on itself. There's no one to blame, no one except ourselves.

The sickness that lies inside me.
The sickness that lies inside you.
The sickness that lies inside them.
The sickness that will bring the end.

I know you're scared, 'cause I am too. There's not much one man can do, but we can fight and choose not to run. Millions to rot under the scorching sun.
You turn your head and hide from the awful truth. You're trapped and blind so what can you do?
Wake up, man up, realize now that you have control. Real men change the world, the question is can you?

We choose to sleep, sheltered in our own lives. What we don't know: out of sight, out of mind.
Admit one for freedom. The end of all rights.
We choose to sleep.
