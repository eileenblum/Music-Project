Suffering insomnia, sleepless by nightmares
Beaten by unknown disease, flesh departs the flesh
Licking fresh wounds, feel the agony's bite
In my devourment syndrome

Satisfaction in perversion, fed by rotten parts
Prosthetic, slashing your guts, lungs on my hands
Last heartbeat, no salvation or forgiveness
All life ends

Poisonous knives dancing on your throat
I will break your spine, cruelty above life
Brutality above life, serenity's lost

Sacrificial horror, venomous infection, murder

Pathetic against pain, tortured by hooks
Abuse this little core, bathe in maggots

Red clouds, blood clouds, red rain, blood rain

Move if you can, swim in this vault
Feel the agony's bite, in my devourment syndrome.
