Pleasure demands pain
I'll divide you, I'll conquer you
The depths of essential senses
Hospitality of a broken neck
Anal domination, a broken neck

Privitism, a broken neck
I'll writhe this open blossom
My art, a tribute in pain

Sodomy, sodomy, sodomy

The liquids of my lust
Are feeding your brand new opened mouth
The one I drilled on your chest
Welcome, divine, erase

Flesh apart from face
You should see your face now
No fucking disguise now
You should see your grace now

Soiled but graceful.
