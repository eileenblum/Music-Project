Grind all minor life, spoil these spotless souls
Bent on your knees, enjoy the grandeur of loss

Feel the chains of occupancy, you're votary to your God
Fucking this impudent puberty, child molesting.

Dyers weed now feel your eyes
Unebutrolled bleeding, scald all the new-born.

A fulcrum of lever less, scald all the new-born
Unebutrolled bleeding, child molesting.

Smile upon opened chests, dance upon screams and cries
Divine homocide, leppers that shouldn't exist.

You pay for your contumancy, I'll fence your mouth with eels.

Soon you'll be forgotten, repose before final subversion.
I'll reform disorder, obligatory recreation.

Innocent glances and sinless bodies
Provoke your voluptuous mind
Speaking straight to your cock
Their sweet skin replaces your rippled one.

Little hands cut, still offer you pleasure
Removed eyeballs, always stare on you.

Grind all minor life, spoil these spotless souls
Bent on your knees, enjoy the grandeur of loss.

Abominations eternally decorate your empty place
Tight assholes fucked only from their own shit.

Time to taste your huge cock
Their miserable life will never live
Gutter soul, child molesting.
