Innards exposed, the project failed
Surrounded by stiffs
Connected for so much time in this chair

System default, drowning in my own blood
No part is allowed to waste just life

Innards exposed, the project failed
Surrounded by stiffs
No control of this deranged mind

Entangled in liquid flesh

Severe default, loss of life
All expandable
All parts disposable

Entangled in liquid flesh

Bewail you, of human pain
I'll teach you the repugnant belief
The torture domain
My guidance to this abattoir

All his thirst, your serum
I'll hedge this sore with acid.
