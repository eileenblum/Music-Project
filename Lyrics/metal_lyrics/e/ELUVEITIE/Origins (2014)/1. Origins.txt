He who has ears to hear, let him hear
For this is a tale of an ancient kind
In the word there lies existence and the word became flesh
And dwelt among us and we saw its glory
Let him hear it who will

Every soul heard
Some ran and hid away
Some listened
Some laughed
Most just stood there
Motionless
Silent
And forgetting
