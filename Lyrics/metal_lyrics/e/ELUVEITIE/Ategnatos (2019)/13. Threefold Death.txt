Will you remember me
Still know my name
When I'm set free?

Is this the way it ends now?
The last thing to see is
The bottom of a fucking cask?

Feeding the crows
Dangling and putrid
In the presence of my own hollowness
Kindling the flames
Scorching and charred
The incarnation of my vainness

What once was believed to be glory
Paled into a scorn, left to derision

Time stood still as I bode the cold iron
And the tendonds coiled around my neck
The carnyx shrill and a world once known
Slowly sank in numbing red

Will you remember me
Still know my name
When I'm set free?

Is this the way it all ends now?
Sense wrest from me
And dignity stripped off it's meaning
A plenary sacrifice

The carnyx shrill and a world once known
Slowly sank in numbing red
The carnyx roared twice and once more
Afore pervasively
The raven's call rang out

Will you remember me
Still know my name
When I'm set free?
Will you still bide awhile
At the great rock
In the evening light?

Will you remember me
Still know my name
When I'm set free?
Will you still bide awhile
At the great rock
In the evening light?

Will you remember me
Still know my name
When I'm set free?
Will you still bide awhile
At the great rock
In the evening light?
