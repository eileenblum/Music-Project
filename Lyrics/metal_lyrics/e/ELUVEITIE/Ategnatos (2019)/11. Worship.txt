And I saw a beast ascending up of the sea of the West
And the beast whom I saw, was like a colossus
Having a crown with ten teeth, and on the ten teeth the names of blasphemy
And from his mouth ran the blood of men
And a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given to it
And all men, worshiped it that dwell in earth
Whose ears be not tethered to the divine tongue
If any man can hear, hear he
And I saw another beast ascending up from the abyss
Alike a Taurus, and it had two horns made of gold
And it spake blasphemies and did all the power of the former beast in his sight
And it made the earth and all men dwelling in it
To worship the first beast

RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI! RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI!
RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI! RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI!

RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI! RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI!
RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI! RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI!

O, come, ye little children
O, come, you one and all
To the mangle come
In my bloodstained realm

Sing glory to me on my throne above you all
Give thanks for nemesis to your golden calf

Like sheep to the slaughter
Like moths to flames

And on your knees
You shall remain
And you shall praise
And fear my name

O, come, ye little children
O, come, you one and all
Come here by me
'Tis your vocation call

Sing glory to your noble saviour and lord
Unshackle the fetters of Ogmios' ploy

Like sheep to the slaughter
Like moths to flames

RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI! RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI!
RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI! RÄªGEI SESRONEÅªI!

And on your knees (on your knees)
You shall remain (shall remain)
And you shall praise (shall praise)
And fear my name

And on your knees
You shall remain (shall remain)
And you shall praise (shall praise)
And fear my name

I shall lift my face upon thee and give you peace
I shall lift my face upon thee
I shall lift my face upon thee and give you peace
I shall lift my face upon thee

And I saw another beast ascending up from the abyss
And it made the earth and all men...
