O bright sun of the night
I lift my eyes up to thee
O ye amber golden light
Let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, o nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness
When nothing is left

O ye fathomless night
I give myself up to thee
And when my time is nigh
Let the silent swallow me
Sacred bosom, o dear grove
I offer thee myself
And I shall rejoice when nothing is left

O bright sun of the night
I lift my eyes up to thee
O ye amber golden light
Let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, o nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness
When nothing is left

O ye fathomless night
I give myself up to thee
And when my time is nigh
Let the silent swallow me
Sacred bosom, o dear grove
I offer thee myself
And I shall rejoice when nothing is left

O bright sun of the night
I lift my eyes up to thee
O ye amber golden light
Let the dark sweep over me
Mighty cauldron, o nidus
I surrender all to thee
Panacean nothingness
When nothing is left
