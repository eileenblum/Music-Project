Blind and beset
They lurch towards pale void
A ghostly host of exiled souls
They've haunted us
For they cannot see
And burned the ones
Who set them free

I've yearned for you
I've yearned for way too long

I'm coming home
Home again
I'm now born again
I lunge into you
And I'll breathe again
I'm coming home

Behold, I have fought my fight, I've run my race
I will be gone, I will be reborn
Into the dark, into the rock
Bright sun of the night, I'm coming home

Home, home again
I'm now born again
I lunge into you
And I'll breathe again
I'm coming home

Forsaken!

Everything that was became what is
And what withers and dies is but alike the larva in its cocoon

I'm coming home
Home again
I'm now born again
I lunge into you
And I'll breathe again
I'm coming home
Home again
I'm now born again
I lunge into you
And I'll breathe again
I'm coming home
