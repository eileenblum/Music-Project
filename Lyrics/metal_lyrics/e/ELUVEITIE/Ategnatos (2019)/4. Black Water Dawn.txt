At the gloaming shore, neither sea nor land
The heaving immeasurable darkness ahead
Moonlit the stannic waves swell up and threat
And the nightly breeze is calling my name

I gaze into the night, as if I could see
No land in sight but a voracious deep
I resign myself onto the barque
To set sail to perdition, a fate so dark

Can you feel them, can you see them
The green hills, the silver stream
Can you not see the newborn sky, the auburn sun
You are so near the sun of the dawn

Across the waves of the fever sea
The lashing billows hurling curses at me
Bawling the cormorant mouths open wide
Snatching and gnawing, bane at my side

Deathwards the ferry glides across the waters so deep
To the foul land, athwart the venomous sea
Resistance worn down and a broken will
A crippled heart, sense come to nil

Can you feel it, can you hear it
The oaks song, the raven's call
Can you not see the newborn sky, the auburn sun
You are so near the sun of the dawn

Can you feel them, can you see them
The green hills, the silver stream
Can you not see the newborn sky, the auburn sun
Can you not see the sun of the dawn
You are so near tir' jovincon
