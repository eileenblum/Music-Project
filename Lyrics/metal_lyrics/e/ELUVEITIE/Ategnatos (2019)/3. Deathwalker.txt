In distress, chased and locked in stalemate
Into the cauldron, to embrace eclipse
And inhale the harrowing
Withering, the sear flesh and blood
Elapsed is the momentary host
Limp, the broken will, worn down the last stand

Extinction!
Extinction!

And I soar up high into the haven
Of the starless night
Borne by black wings of dawn
I fly away from the bygone
As I crossed alone
The gold turned into dead stone
And I did not look back
Nor did I mourn

At the gate in a place between dimensions
I swathed myself, to embrace eclipse
And to sink into the void
And I chased through the nightly brake
Unseen, shot through icy streams
High above the crowns and down into the dark

And I soar up high into the haven
Of the starless night
Borne by black wings of dawn
I fly away from the bygone
As I crossed alone
The gold turned into dead stone
And I did not look back
Nor did I mourn

(Aidus esti - io gnÄtÄ uer axsin
Bitous uertassit in uextlon)
On this bridge so narrow
The shoddy rags fell off me
Robed in nakedness I entered the gate

Deathwalking o'er the searing bridge
At the time between the times
I witness and herald
We do not perish but only slough

And I soar up high into the haven
Of the starless night
Borne by black wings of dawn
I fly away from the bygone
As I crossed alone
The gold turned into dead stone
And I did not look back
Nor did I mourn
