With insatiable hunger the godsent avengers
They feed on the volatile and evanescent
Raving across the face of the Earth
Cheering the gods in untamed frenzy

Feel the bite of the flames, cathartic firestorm
The seas of flames dance in ecstasy
See the billows smother cleansing away
Pruning of all filth

Voracious blaze
Engulf and erase
In one colossal feast

O deep blue flood
Roar your symphonia
Until there's nothing left

Like a relentless wolverine the ravenous unleashed
The blood-red swarm is devouring
Inferno divine
Revelling in sanctity

Voracious blaze
Engulf and erase
In one colossal feast

O deep blue flood
Roar your symphonia
Until there's nothing left

Mine is the fury
In my hands is justice
I bring atonement
And herald a new dawn
I ring the knell
I bring to life
I am the healing
I am the erasing

I am the beginning
I am the end

The end

With insatiable hunger the godsent avengers
They feed on the volatile and evanescent
Raving across the face of the Earth
Cheering the gods in untamed frenzy

Feel the weight of the waves, the cleansing storm surge
The invincible shall pacify
The wheel shall turn as it is foretold
Exult and rejoice

Voracious blaze
Engulf and erase
In one colossal feast

O deep blue flood
Roar your symphonia
Until there's nothing left
