Step by step
We trudge on
On this scarlet road
Adrift and immured
Keen and uncured
Grimly walking the will of the one

One foot in front of the other one
On this steep road paved with our blood
Step by step we march a long walk
And breath by breath we just plough on

And I long to wake
Come up for air

But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand

One truth after the other one
Given and served we swallow down
Day by day we drink the blood of our sons
So they will walk this road again

But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand

Whitedreaming
One, two! One, two! Forlorn, march!
Linewalking

Lift your eyes
I can see the light
March on, march on
Lift your eyes
You can see it too
March on voidwards

Lift your eyes
I can see the light
March on, we march on
Lift your eyes
You can see it too
March on voidwards

And I long to wake
Come up for air

But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
But we stagger in slumber
Sleepwalking and lost
The long march we wander
Dreaming of the promised land
And mocked by the death knell at hand
