[English translation:]

Were you at the rock
Or did you see my love
Or did you see a brightness
The beauty of this land

Or did you see the apple
The sweetest and most fragant blossom
Or did you see the meadows of Nantarora
Are they blossoming as they say?

Oh I was at the rock
And I saw your love
Oh I saw your brightness
The beauty of your land

Oh I did see the old town of Brenoduron
The sweetest and brightest beacon
And I saw our love
And she is blossoming as they say

Were you at the rock
Or did you see my love
Or did you see a brightness
The beauty of this land

Or did you see the apple
The sweetest and most fragant blossom
Or did you see the meadows of Nantarora
Are they blossoming as they say?
