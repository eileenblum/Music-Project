In a virgin world primeval
A newborn bullcalf emerged
Wondrous and celestial
Three cranes to be its witness and droves
Its honour mantled the face of the earth

A blessing unleashed to the earth
Unseathed the embodiment of life

Tarvos - the embodiment of life
Tarvos - the genesis of time

The earthy heathlands roamed by esus
Questing condign sacrifice
A divine yearning hushed by the prodigy
Three cranes to wake up the slumbering taur
To warn him 'gainst the imminence of a huntergod ravenous

"A drawn struggle through innominate days
As ultimately the sword of esus
Pierced the bulls heart
Three cranes to lament as its blood laves
Creation wept under an eclipsing sun
As gloom descended upon world
Three cranes to catch a drop of blood
And leave far away..."

A blessing depraved from the world
As snow fell for the first time on earth

Three cranes returned
Pouring out the blood
To the ground of tarvos' death
And out of nothing
The soil sacrified, the divine bull was reborn
Under a newborn sun nature rejoiced
Thus spring came back on earth
Overcame the brumal reign
Through esus came back
To fell the bull, the eternal cycle has begun

Tarvos - will always be slain
Tarvos - ever to be reborn again
