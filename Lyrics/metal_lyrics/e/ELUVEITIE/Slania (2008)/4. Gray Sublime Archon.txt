I raise my hand against ye, thief!
For we're accustomed to receive,
Not to give hostages
Hear these words! deeds are overt!

As chaos evolves
In worthless lies

A crucial congress
At saÃ´nes banks

Gray Sublime Archon I've been called
Through all these years I bore up
Now may we all stay the course
This day

I raise my hand against it all
I question now, did I fail?
Or retain our dignity
And shelter of this defilement?
