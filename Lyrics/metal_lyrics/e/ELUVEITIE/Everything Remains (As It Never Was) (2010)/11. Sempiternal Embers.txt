Glowing and blazing
In the wind of times
Ever lit
Searching and fathoming
The fire's arcane
Consuming flames
Sparks to imbue
Our very souls

Pervading the very breath of life
Flickering from the depths of eternity

Never asleep
Never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear
The sempiternal embers
Never profaned
Never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit
Never faint
The sempiternal embers

The essence of being
The form of existence
Forever inflamed with passion
Heart of hearts
Burning so bright
Yet clandestine

Gleaming in the lair
Of the powers to be
The four mighty ones
The high kings concealed

Giving birth to the glimmer within
Incessantly fostering the flames...

Glowing and blazing
In the wind of times
Ever lit
Searching and fathoming
Sparks to imbue
Our very souls
