Who will measure the dimensions of antumnos?
Who can tell the gauge of its veil?
Who can manifest the size of its maw?
And infer the value of its stones?

Yet the glowing wick will not be quenched
The sown fire will never die

What is
What ever was
What ever is to come
What would
What ever should
It will remain as it never was

Eternity's past was repeated in time
The eternal knot will be unbroken
Whence comes the motion in this picture?
Where does the moment go when it steals away?
Who will pen the pages of the time?
Who will be the audience when the curtains rises?

Where do we go. question mark.
What have we become. question mark.
Whither went what was. question mark.
Shall there ever be dawn. question mark.
Did we ever change?
