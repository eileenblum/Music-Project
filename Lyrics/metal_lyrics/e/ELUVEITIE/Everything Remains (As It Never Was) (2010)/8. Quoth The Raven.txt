I am the mystery
And I am the bringer of the moonless night
I bear the wisdom arcane
I, harbinger from the burrowed isle

Once you break forth
Hearken the flap of my wings

I haunt tour fears
Though you don't know of my duty
To lead your path
Because I'll take you home to rest
In my black wings enfolding you

I am the icon sublime
The guide of the voyage clandestine
I sing the verses bewailed
I, torch of the radiant way

Once you step out
Hearken the strokes of my wings
Once you will leave your cocoon
I will be there

And death will smile his barefaced smile
Initiating your final anguish
It is not before my arrival
that you will be led to feel
the natural serenity of leaving this world...
Hear my wings caressing the wind!
Hear my cry!

I haunt your fear
Though you don't know my duty
To lead your path
Because I'll take you home to rest
In my black wings, enfolding you
