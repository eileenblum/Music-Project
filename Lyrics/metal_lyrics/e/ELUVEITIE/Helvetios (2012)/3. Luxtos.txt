At the rise of a new dawn
Rose the children of the sun
To inhabit a kingdom
augustly crowded in rock mass vast

All lakes are sanctuaries
Like covert nemetons
All forests are hallowed
Blest groves of an invictus tribe

Nertom woloutom que
etsi snis karamos-e

Nertom woloutom que etsi snis
emmos snis riyi emmos snis
widomor-e karamos-e
emmos snis riyi emmos snis andometi
nertom woloutom que etsi snis
emmos snis riyi emmos snis

[English translation:
We are strong and we are rich
And we gladly are
We are strong and we are rich
We are free, that's what we are
We know it and we love to know it
We are free and we are untamed
We are strong and we are rich
We are free, that's what we are]

a kingly tribe sublime
arose in its golden time
in a prosperous era
the age primordial reign

a horde of untameables
invincible armada
a dashing bold host
of venturous fearnaughts
