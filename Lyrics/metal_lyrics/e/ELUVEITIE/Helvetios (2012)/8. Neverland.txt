(Behold, behold, behold, behold)
Behold this proud crestfallen parade
Dead bodies towered up like this dividing rampart
The hopes of yesterday forgotten and interred
Burnt to the ground

Lacerate
My Neverland belauded
My Otherworld elapsed
My silver lining

Another false dawn collapsed
A glimpse of our safe home (home)
Perished in Bibracte
Another hope dearly payed
When we all were betrayed (betrayed)
The end to our exodus

Behold this egregious mockery
We refused to bow down
Our own goddamn blood was the price we had to pay
Santones land we never got to see

Lacerate
My Neverland bore down

Another false dawn collapsed
A glimpse of our safe home (home)
Perished in Bibracte
Another hope dearly payed
When we all were betrayed (betrayed)
The end to our exodus

Lacerate
My Neverland belauded
My Otherworld elapsed
My hopes were dead

Another false dawn collapsed
A glimpse of our safe home (home)
Perished in Bibracte
Another hope dearly payed
When we all were betrayed (betrayed)
The end to our exodus

When the fiends come marching in
When the fiends come marching in
