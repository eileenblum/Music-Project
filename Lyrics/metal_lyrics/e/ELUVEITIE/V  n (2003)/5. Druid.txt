Mysteries of life, mysteries of death
Mysteries of mountain and forest, mysteries of nature
Mysteries of the sky, mysteries of the earth
Mysteries of dreams, mysteries of love

Mysteries of the soul, mysteries of mankind
Mysteries of thoughts, mysteries of words
Mysteries of pains, mysteries of healings
Mysteries of answers, mysteries of mysteries

No objectivity lies there to be preached, but yet no relativity
No doctrine shall be found on my lips, for its thruth I seek to give

Drus, Animongaro
Lover of God
I give the love, that I am given
With the truth against the world

Through the mysteries of life, I wander on my path
And seek to give some wisdom, that I am given
This little flame of mine. I will always let it shine
For all who wander, to the glory of the mystery
