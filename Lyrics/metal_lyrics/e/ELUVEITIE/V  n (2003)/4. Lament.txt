I wonder what we've become...
A land so full of ritches bought with blood!
A land so free, yet chasing for wind...
As we look up to false giant emperors
We've lost our pride of old, the innocence is gone!

Clan of Elveti
Weep for your land
....and your children!

What if we'd still be proud and simple minded?
What if there would not be so much blood on our invisible hands?
What if there would not be billions to feed the lusts of war?
What if not all these subtile hidden injustices?

What if there would not be a state church
Built on hypocrisy, instead on faith?
What if we'd still be a simple clan of nature
With all its frailties but with some knowledge of righteousness?
