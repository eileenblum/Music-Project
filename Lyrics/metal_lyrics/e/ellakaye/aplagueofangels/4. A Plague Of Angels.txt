YOU REALLY MADE AN ENTRANCE, YA I SUPPOSE
YOU STRIKE A NERVE WHEN YOU STRIKE THAT POSE
BUT I'VE SEEN YOU AT YOUR WORST
I'VE SEEN THAT FABLED MORNING AFTER
AND YOU'RE A COMPLETE DISASTER

TAKE OFF YOUR COSTUMES, YOU'LL NEVER STOP UNDRESSING
AND I ADMIT THIS TONGUE WILL NEVER STOP CONFESSING
I'VE GOT THE HEART OF A SHARK AND I'M ALMOST SORRY
BUT YOU, YOU'VE GOT BAD BLOOD AND YOU TRY TO INFECT ME

THERE WAS AN ALTERCATION AT THE ALTAR, I TAKE BACK MY VOWS
LOYALTY IS A NOVELTY, OH IF YOU COULD SEE ME NOW
YOU LEAD A PLAGUE OF ANGELS, BUT ANGELS HAVE NO SOULS
YOU LEAD A PLAGUE OF ANGELS. YOU ARE A PLAGUE 

AND YOU'RE COMPROMISED
BURNED OUT THE STARS I SAILED BY
FLOODED THE BOW, WE'VE RUN AGROUND

YOUR BED WAS MADE BY YOUR LACK OF GRACE
NO DIFFERENT FROM THE REST
THE QUICKEST WAY TO THE HEART?
THROUGH THE FUCKING CHEST

DAMN RIGHT I'M A ROMANTIC
AND I PREACH WHAT I PRACTICE
I'LL PULL THE VANITY FROM YOUR EYES 
THEN DESCRIBE BEAUTY TO THE BLIND

AND YOU'RE COMPROMISED
BURNED OUT THE STARS I SAILED BY
FLOODED THE BOW, WE'VE RUN AGROUND

YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF ALL ALONE
NO WINGS, JUST TEETH AND BONE
DEAF TO THE SOUND OF YOUR HEART BREAKING
NUMB TO THE FEEL OF YOURSELF SHAKING
