IT'S NOT JUST HEAVEN WHERE ANGELS DWELL,
I FOUND THE PLACE WHERE ONE FELL.
FROM HER HEART HUNG ICICLES, 
WHAT'S THAT SAY ABOUT MIRACLES?

I THOUGHT THAT CREATURE WAS HEAVEN SENT,
BUT NO, SHE'S JUST HELL BENT

SHE'S A GLACIER
A REAPER
AN ICEBERG 
A KEEPER

BUT THEN THAT BATTLE AXE, MY ARIES, SHE HAD A RELAPSE
AND HEAVEN WANTED HER BACK.

IT'S LIKE A HOLOCAUST WITH ALL THE LIVES I'VE LOST

BUT COME HELL OR HIGH WATER, I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HER
DEFY THE STARS, REWRITE THE NIGHT

BUT WHEN THE CADENCE CAME SHE SIGNED HER MAIDEN NAME

SHE'LL NEVER SLEEP ALONE 
I'LL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN

SO CUT ME OUT AND
CUT ME UP
