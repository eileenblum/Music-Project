POSTPONE THE AFTERMATH FOR A MOMENT
AND LET THE CHAOS REIGN.
RESONATE RING TRUE, LET THE FLAMES CONSUME
BACKWARD MENTALITIES

OVERCOME! SHELL SHOCKED!
I DISPOSE OF THE WAYS OF THE WICKED
OVERCOME! SHELL SHOCKED!
I PRESENT YOU A NEW WORLD ORDER.
RISE, YOUR NEW FOUND KINGDOM.
THRIVE WITHIN YOUR KINGDOM.

INSCRIBED UPON THE INSIDE OF MY EYELIDS
MAPS ILLUMINATE THE WAY I SEEK
TO REACH AN ENDLESS SYMPHONY
OF LOVE INCARNATE REVERIE.

LIKE SIRENS IN THE SEA, MY FREEDOM'S CALLING ME.
ASPIRE RESTLESSLY TO OWN THE LIFE I LEAD.

AND FROM THE FOREFRONT
YOU WILL HEAR OUR SCREAMS.
AND IN THE AFTERMATH
WE'LL GLEAM IN VICTORY.
