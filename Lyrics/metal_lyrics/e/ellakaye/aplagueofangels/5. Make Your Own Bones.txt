YOU'LL FIND ME AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART
SCREAMING "THERE'S DEATH IN THESE WALLS!"
"KILL ME NOW" I MAY HAVE SAID TO THE SKY AS I ROLLED MY EYES
I WAS HOMEWARD BOUND BUT THIS IS HER TOWN NOW
AND I'LL HIT THE ROAD WHEN I'M GOOD AND READY
BECAUSE I MAKE THE BONES I BURY

MY EYES ARE SINKING SHIPS,
MY HEART STRINGS PLAY THEM DOWN IN MINOR CHORDS.
MY EYES ARE SINKING.

NOW THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN SOUNDS LOVELY,
DEEP WITH MILES OF WATER ABOVE ME.
UNTIL I RUN OUT OF AIR
AND MY HEART BEATS IN MY EARS.

SO YOU'LL FIND ME LONE-WOLFING FROM TOWN TO TOWN
SEARCHING FOR MOUTH TO MOUTH.
FORGIVE MY OVER-CORRECTION, ITS JUST FOR MISDIRECTION

MY EYES ARE SINKING SHIPS,
MY HEART STRINGS PLAY THEM DOWN IN MINOR CHORDS.
MY EYES ARE SINKING.
