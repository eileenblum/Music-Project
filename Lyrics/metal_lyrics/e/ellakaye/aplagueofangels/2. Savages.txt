FUCKING LISTEN, DO YOU HEAR THIS SOUND?
THE DEAF LEAD THE DEAF FOR TOO LONG NOW.
THIS IS NOT A FASHION
IT'S OUR PURPOSE, OUR LOVE, OUR PASSION.
OUR VOICE, OUR ART
OUR MINDS, OUR HEART

AND IT'S PURE GOLD, BUT NOT YOUR CURRENCY
THIS FORTUNE, OUR HEIRS ARE MELODIES.

NOT FOR THE SIMPLE MINDS, THE PRIMITIVES
OR THE WASTE OF LIVES, THE SAVAGES

FORGED BY THE FIRE INSIDE US,
SONGS WE SING REMIND US
OF A LIFE WORTH LIVING,
A FLAME WORTH BURNING.

A LITTLE CONVICTION GOES A LONG WAY

NOT FOR THE SIMPLE MINDS, THE PRIMITIVES
OR THE WASTE OF LIVES, THE SAVAGES

WE ARE A DYING BREED
THIS IS A CRUMBLING SCENE
BUT WE'LL BE ENGINEERS.
WE ARE THE ARCHITECTS 
AND WE WILL REBUILD.
