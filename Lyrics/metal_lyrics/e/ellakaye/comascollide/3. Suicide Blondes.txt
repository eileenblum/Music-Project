[feat. Michael Barr (Volumes)]Youâre as shallow as the water you were never baptized in.
Iâve got calloused finger tips from your pull-string Barbie rhetoric.
You speak with less conviction than a hopeless romantic.
Fortune favors the bold
but attracts hearts so cold.
It lies dormant in our bones
and brings us together alone.
As we conspire to inspire
the stakes have never been higher.
Keep the suicides away from knives
or theyâll connect the cuts.
Letâs call a spade a spade.
Clip your wings with your shoulder blades.
Temper, temper. Would you eat your young?
Would you join the feeding?
I canât be your tourniquet. I canât stop the bleeding.
Fortune favors the bold
but attracts hearts so cold.
It lies dormant in our bones
and brings us together alone.
As we conspire to inspire
the stakes have never been higher.
Keep the suicides away from knives
or theyâll connect the cuts.
Guard your heart.
