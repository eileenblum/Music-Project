[feat. Alexia Rodriguez (Eyes Set To Kill)]She fills my eyes like she was made of gold.
And oh yes she glitters and she glows.
Thereâs nothing that I regret.
Donât want to give into bitter envy.
I would rather forget.
Donât want to relive it, donât want to relive it.
She clings to purity so she can cast her stones.
I withdraw but i know sheâs never alone.
If these sheets could talk, they would not stop,
saying that they miss her, my blood feels thicker.
Donât leave me alone.
Once upon my mattress, we became a classic.
We burned hot like matches and outran the panic.
Once upon her sadness, we became so tragic.
We burned out like matches and only spoke in static.
If these sheets could talk, they would not stop,
saying that they miss her, my blood feels thicker.
Donât leave me alone.
Sheâs burning the bridge that leads her home.
Sheâs running away, sheâs leaving me alone.
