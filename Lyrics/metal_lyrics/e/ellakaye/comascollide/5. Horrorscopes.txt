[feat. Aaron Matts (Betraying The Martyrs)]I'm an escapist. Secretive and vague.
Thatâs what the horoscopes say.
Cursed by timing and fucking patterns,
finding light by broken lanterns.
Iâm a grave robber,
wrong doer,
home wrecker,
blood sucker.
Choked on swallowed pride,
no light in these eyes that this shiner outshines.
Iâll drink your blood, your love, your joyâ¦
Iâm just a lost boy.
Iâll be the life of the pity party,
the guest of honor.
I wait with bated breath
for you to just be honest.
No matter what you want to believe,
these city streets is where I cut my teeth.
Open a tab, Iâll turn blood into wine.
Iâve stained your dress with less, Iâve killed myself with time.
Choked on swallowed pride. No light in these eyes.
Iâll drink your blood.
Iâll be the life of the pity party,
the guest of honor.
I wait with bated breath
for you to just be honest.
The slings and arrows make me shiver.
The slings and arrows make me quiver.
