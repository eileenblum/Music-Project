From anchor to deserter.
For you, I would murder.
Nothing to see but I canât keep my eyes closed.
Lights out with my head against the window.
Taking blows from the burdens that I bear
when it rains it pours, when it pours, I sit and stare.
Like rolling eyes, blackness soon will be.
Like ocean tides, carry me out to sea.
This too, this too shall pass.
Hold fast, I must hold fast.
These idle hands are tied to keep them from sin
but with arms bound, how am I to swim?
Water everywhere, a thirst I cannot quench.
The fins come circle closer, my limbs are hanging over.
Carry me out to sea.
This too, this too shall pass.
Hold fast, I must hold fast.
Mermaid theories to no avail.
Iâll meet you in the belly of the whale.
From anchor to deserter.
For you, I would murder.
