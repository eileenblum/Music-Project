[feat. Jared Warth (Blessthefall)]Sinners rejoice, youâre not alone.
Iâve come to reap what I have sewn.
Sinners rejoice youâre not alone.
Canât change the seeds from which weâre grown.
Been haunted by the same old ghosts.
Red lips, white teeth, and they smell of smoke.
So I curse the heavens, reveal my maddest edges.
Up on mountains where trees canât breathe so they rot.
I try to break this curse. Iâm more trouble than Iâm worth.
I try to break this curse.
I rework navigation, Design my constellations.
A cartographer mapping the dark.
Count your blessings while I count sheep,
While youâre resting, I canât sleep.
My empty heart, my will is weak.
While youâre resting, I canât sleep.
So I curse the heavens,reveal my maddest edges.
Up on mountains where trees canât breathe so they rot.
Tempt not a desperate man with ripe fruit in barren lands.
Tempt not a desperate man.
I rework navigation, Design my constellations.
A cartographer mapping the dark.
Count your blessings while I count sheep,
While youâre resting, I canât sleep.
My empty heart, my will is weak.
While youâre resting, I canât sleep.
Iâve spent years losing nights
purging poison from my vile vices.
Swallow blood til my stomach aches,
feed the wolves til they asphyxiate.
I gave em hell. I shook the foundations.
Those who knew me well will skip my procession.
