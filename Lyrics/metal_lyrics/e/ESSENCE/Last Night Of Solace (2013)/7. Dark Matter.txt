South polar region of titan
Atmospheric haze of frozen nitrogen
Liquid hydrocarbon lakes
Still horizon on a core of silicate

Radioactive decay of subatomic particles
Initiates the process known as hydrogen fusion
All light is but a specular reflection
On a natural satellite so dense

Wrath - extreme power
Channelized by dark matter
Intervention in the planetary ring
Shepherd moons and shadow gravity
Existing and ruling in the gap
We cannot see

Radioactive decay of subatomic particles
Initiates the process known as hydrogen fusion
Stellar magnetic field
Solar atmosphere
Staring into the sky

All is on a collision course
Since the dawn of time
Space itself has been
Twisting and turning our lives

Fade - ultimate fate of the universe
Ripped apart by phantom dark energy
Reaching out for the galaxies
Crush all into unbound particles
The end of our universe - state of singularity
The expansion rate becomes infinite

Quintessence - hypothetical form of dark energy
A fifth fundamental force in the fourth dimension
Repulsive - attractive
Dynamic in equation and in state because it changes over time
Silence is the one who rule a frameless world
Potential energy by kinetics

All is on a collision course
Since the dawn of time
Space itself has been
Twisting and turning our lives

The lives that live is nothing but
And illusion of what I see so clear
As I stand under the night sky at my home
And I think to myself
I need to lay my head down to rest
So that I keep dreaming about the stars
