Light fades away and the shadows take its place
A natural phenomena like nothing ever seen
Result of any observable event
From the interaction between light and matter

Don't believe what your eyes see!

Prophet Muhammad described zodiacal light
In the five daily prayers - to be the false dawn
Viciously lurking beyond the horizon
Reflected - Refracted
Reflected - Refracted
Sunlight Scattered by space dust

Nothing will ever last
Nothing will ever be
Eternity and life together is hypocrisy
Nothing will ever last
No one will ever be
Ready to give all up for
The final eclipse

Feeling so alive when I don't believe my eyes
See the universe collide in a fracture of my mind
As the galaxy itself is falling from the skies
Solar winds bless me the northern lights
I fall to my knees - this geomagnetic storm
In the earth's theromsphere brings emissions of photons
Ionized collision

Earth shadow is an atmospheric phenomenom
Dark band, clear sky - look to the horizon 
Always in the dead of night and visible at twilight
Sunset - sunrise
Sunset - sunrise

Nothing will ever last
Nothing will ever be
Eternity and life together is hypocrisy
Nothing will ever last
No one will ever be
Ready to give all up for
The final eclipse

All is illusions - the final eclipse awaits
All is illusions - the final eclipse awaits
Ravaging the world as we know it
Don't see the light - don't see the way
It's burning through the shadow of our moon
It's all too late
All hope is gone - end of the life we lived too long

Nothing will ever last
Nothing will ever be
Eternity and life together is hypocrisy
Nothing will ever last
No one will ever be
Ready to give all up for
The final eclipse
