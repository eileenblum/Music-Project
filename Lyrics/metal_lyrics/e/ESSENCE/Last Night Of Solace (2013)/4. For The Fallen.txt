Sitting all alone by the door in 1945
Waiting for her children to return
It's been so long now
So many winters have passed
Without the slightes sign of life

Calling from the front
Calling in - Calling out
Calling from the fronr
Calling home
My letter was not sent
And I dont dare to even hope
When all is gone then nothing's left
The pressure's on - it's so intense

Germany to France and from Paris to Berlin
From the sores of Normandy we brought the war
It followed us close and we always brought 'em hell
No matter what they did we always endured it

Lock it up - suck it up
Don't ever go to war with us
We're bringing all the power in the world
And we don't take no shit
So you better think twice before you roll the dice
'Cause the snake eyes is craving your lives

Remember what I did for you
Remember what you didn't do for me

Every now and then
This feeling inside
Open up the wounds
And let it out

Every now and then
I get lost in time
Forget myself - hope
To take back my life

I count the hours passing by

1 year at the front
2 years at  the front

3 years coming up - at the front
I only serve the front
And I don't care what others say
'Cause they don't know a fucking thing
Of what it's like to fight for your life

With a cross in my hand
And with hope in my heart
I maintain a strong belief
That this willl change the world
And if not at least I tried
Now I know That
United we fight and divided we fall

Remember what I did for you
Remember what you didn't do for me

Every now and then
This feeling inside
Open up the wounds
And let it out

Every now and then
I get lost in time
Forget myself - hope
To take back my life

All I get is hate from all sides
The only thing I did
Was to win your fight
In honor there is hope
But this hope is not for me
You ripped me from pride
And stripped me from my life

Hell
You should try what it's like
To be in hell
You should try what it's like
To burn in hell

At last I found my way back home
In 1946 I returned to the door
Where my journey began with a step outside
But the door was locked and on it was a sign

No one is alive - I can't believe she died

Every now and then
This feeling inside
Open up the wounds
And let it out

Every now and then
I get lost in time
Forget myself - hope
To take back my life

Every now and then
When the rain is pouring down
It hurts my bones and
I wish you were here

Every now and then
I need you near
To remind myself
I lived my life without hate
