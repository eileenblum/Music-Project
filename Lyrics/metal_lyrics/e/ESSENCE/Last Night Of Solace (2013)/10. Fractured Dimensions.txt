[Bonus Track]A line is drawn, a stage is set
A battle is upon the curtain moves
The audience anxiously awaits
As the final act is starting to take place

Gracefully they're striking from above
Judgement blasting out of heaven
Hammering the anvil from the skies
Banging in the nails one by one

There's fire in the night

Trapped in an alien reality sentenced to die
Lost in a deserted world used to be mine
Searching for intelligent life to help get me out
Cover, no one must see me
Look to the sky and feel the fire
The fire which flames burn into my skin

Here is lighting skies
In the night
Falling from above
Hear the blast
Feel the clash
The hammer's striking hard

Shattering
All the things
Getting in its way
Splitting time
Fractured my
Dimension made of clay

Have mercy

What to do? I need someone
To help me find what I'm looking for.
Earth's core is overheating
And time's running out. life's nowhere to be found

Locked up
In a fractured dimension
Awaiting final death
Locked up
In a fractured dimension
Holding my last breath

Grains of sand keep me running blind
I can't seem to find the light
Leading me to inner peace
I want to be free

Locked up
Locked up
Locked up
Locked up


Locked up in a shattered dimension
Feelings of apprehension
Burning all the light and my energy
Needed to flee from the storm

Timeless is a fleeting hope
It's fleeting this dimension to escape
Euphoric master piece of heart
You're lying if you're saying you don't care

Locked up
Locked up
Locked up
Locked up

Fire
The fire which flames burn into my skin

Here is lighting skies
In the night
Falling from above
Hear the blast
Feel the clash
The hammer's striking hard

Shattering
All the things
Getting in its way
Splitting time
Fractured my
Dimension made of clay

Have mercy
Free my soul
