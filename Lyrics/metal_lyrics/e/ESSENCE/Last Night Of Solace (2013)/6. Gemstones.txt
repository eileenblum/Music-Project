Fractured minerals lurking as quartz in the deeps
Hiding from the world - waiting in their sleep
Silicon - oxygen harvested to
Satisfy needs - satisfy greed
Never ending heartless quest for indulgence cause
Nature's free - money me

Ruby, diamonds, emerald, crystal
Jade, jasper, gold, pearls,
Silver, amber, opal, garnet,
Coral, topaz, xenon, sapphire

These are the words that lead to aggression
Weak souls react to what blind their hearts
Emptiness - feel depressed
Now inject - to release the press
Why pay the price
When you can get what you want for free
Invest in me and exploit your oppurtunities

Digging hard and deep to achieve what the stockholders need
Financial support to breath fire in machinery
You must never feel ashamed to get in the game
Satisfy needs - satisfy greed
Never ending heartless quest for indulgence cause
Nature's free - money me

Ruby, diamonds, emerald, crystal
Jade, jasper, gold, pearls,
Silver, amber, opal, garnet,
Coral, topaz, xenon, sapphire

No more words that can lead to aggression
Not for the rich and minority of man
Religiously on the knees
Bow your head and receive the
Diadem of death - no time for a crown of thorns
What the hell do you take me for
Give it to the poor

Deep in my soul
Is a prism shaped heart
Containing no blood
Beating by the will of my mind

I rest my head all far away
Escape the pain and live for today
By the shore of a sandy beach
I'll live my dream - the golden fantasy

When I lay down to rest
I feel a knife in my chest
It's not a sign of consciousness
It's a fully grown cardiac arrest
It chills down my spine
As I feel the hand of time
I don't want to leave what's mine
But now it's time for me to

Die, die, die

The words are ringing in my head
All I will be ever forced to regret
Are all the things that I have done
Will not matter when I'm gone

Deep in my soul
Is a prism shaped heart
Containing no blood
Beating by the will of my mind

I rest my head all far away
Escape the pain and live for today
By the shore of a sandy beach
I'll live my dream - the golden fantasy

Fractured gemstones
The soul will blast away
Fractured gemstones
It was more than you could take
