Crawling in the shadows
Crawling down crawling down
Crawling in the shadows
Crawling down from the nest in the night
Darkness hides
All concealed from the world
Fallen asleep - all alone in the dark
Free to wonder off in the night

Spin a web - spin it wide
Spin a web of deadly lies
Watch yourself - you must hide
Watch yourself or you will die

Arachnophobia

Stalking down the walls
Stalking down to hidde in your sheet
Silence is a virtue in the mist
REM sleep - a sign of fear twisting crystal dreams
Progressive nightmares
I taste your salty skin in the night

Spin a web - spin it wide
Spin a web of deadly lies
Watch yourself - you must hide
Watch yourself or you will die

Arachnophobia

Paralyzed - stunned by fear
Stare into cold black eyes
Fangs revealed - bite of death
Injecting what seems to be a
Ruthless medicine called

Neurotoxine, liquid PHTX3
Live for spreading the disease
A deadly fantasy becomes reality
Venomous terror, venomous pain
Killing at night, lurking at day
Venomous terror, venomous pain
Endless aggression stalking the pray

Spin a web - spin it wide
Spin a web of deadly lies
Watch yourself - you must hide
Watch yourself or you will die
