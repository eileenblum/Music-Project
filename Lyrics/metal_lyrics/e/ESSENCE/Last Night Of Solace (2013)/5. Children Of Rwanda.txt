One hundred days of aggression
Three months in the absence of light
Cruelty and violence as obsessions
A conflict causing a millions of crimes

A land torn into pieces united by hate

Let the blood spill and be flowing in the streets
Creating a river of guilt
Leading the nation into war against its own
Demanding everyone to search and kill

All ist the enemy - It is as simple as this
Now the world is mad
Hunger - terror - blind corner of the eye
Executing the most dreadful - genocide of our time

Children of Rwanda left to die
One million bodies piled high
Rise from the ashes and obey the call
An empire stands and an empire falls

Ashes to ashes - in a civilized world
Blood for blood - spilled as it turns
Not a day passes by
Without the innocent getting
Violated for some blood-dripping cash

Nothing is forbidden in the essence of a lie
Eyes of glass see all - you can't hide now
Sixteen years have passed but I will never forget
The crimes they did - the lives they took
The day you let them

Take away my son - kill my loved ones
Shatter all my life
A broken heart drained for life
A broken heart drained for blood
Empty words when you said that
Nothing could be done

Children of Rwanda left to die
One million bodies piled high
Rise from the ashes and obey the call
An empire stands and an empire falls

Ashes to ashes - in a civilized world
Blood for blood - spilled as it turns
Not a day passes by
Without the innocent getting
Violated for some blood-dripping cash

Darkness in my soul leaves my body cold
I can't see why I shouldn't commit suicide

Ashes to ashes - in a civilized world
Blood for blood - spilled as it turns
Not a day passes by
Without the innocent getting
Violated for some blood-dripping cash
