[By L. Skov, T. Nefer]

Fighting forever for human cruelty
Holocaust on battlefields is my specialty
I decide millions of fates
And in my trench hole certain death awaits
Now you march forward to die
Feel now the hatred come alive
Full metal jackets of death in the air
Piercing the helmets of privates with fear
Endless killing, endless death
Machine gun fire in the night
Fight to live
Fight to serve
Fight to win
Fight to die
Fight to feel
Fight to kill
Storming up in a frontal attack
The killing is on - there's no turning back
All I see is blitz in the night
The blasts of bombs and pain-filled cries
Running under an all-seeing eye
Lighting green and lighting in the skies

Time to shoot - kill
Endless killing, endless death
Machine gun fire in the night
Fight to live
Fight to serve
Fight to win
Fight to die
Fight to feel
Fight to kill
Ripped from life and tossed into a violent war of death
Every man for himself - shot you in the head
Nothing ever last and neither did your life
Prepare for total war as you step into the night
Blackest of night in your mind
Darkness fills your eyes tonight
Black knights of death
Are marching forward to take your life
Darkness descends
An everlasting war to terminate the saintly
Destruction of the world
From the heart of darkness
The ending of all life
