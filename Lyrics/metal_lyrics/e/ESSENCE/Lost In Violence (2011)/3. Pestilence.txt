[By L Skov, T Nefer]

In the night when the hordes come out
A whole new world is born from pain
Shredding light and destroying what's good
A graceful mist of pure darkness
Tearing the souls of greater men
These wicked creations stand proud
Leading the way for those who follow
A blackened star for children of evil
It doesn't matter if we stand alone
It doesn't matter if we die
Still we will reign in terror and fear
Just as long as you keep us in your mind
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence in your head
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence takes control now
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence designed to kill
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence bringing worldwide death
Shining in the dark and always victorious
Living in the shadows though we are glorious
We do not exist and yet we are here
We do not exist and still we are feared
Exterminate - wherever you go
Exterminate - we're coming for you
Exterminate - prepare for attack
Exterminate - no turning back
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence in your head
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence takes control now
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence designed to kill
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence bringing worldwide death
Trapped in hell - now die
Death by terror - don't close your eyes
'cause the nightmares have just begun
Look into your deepest of thoughts
We will haunt you no matter what
When the hunt is over and its time to execute
You'll know that death has arrived
Stare into our eyes and take your life
Finally you decide to die
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence in your head
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence takes control now
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence designed to kill
Pestilence annihilation, pestilence bringing worldwide death
Were you supposed to die tonight? we don't know
Few days left and they would have let you go
Why did you take the choice you made?
I wonder if there could have been another way
Still remembered though you're gone and
In our hearts all the memories live on
Time won't change what we feel
Forever missed and nothing ever heals
