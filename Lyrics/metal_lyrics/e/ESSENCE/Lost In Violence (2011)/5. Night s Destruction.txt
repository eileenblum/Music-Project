[by L. Skov, T. Refer]

born from pain and fire
Direct descend of hell
Born from pain and fire
Where the flames are burning well
Follow the misery
Kill all - leave none to be
Reign now; control the land
Justice by your hand
Only the dead have seen the end of war
Roam throughout the land
Lead by the darkest of commands: kill'em all
From the front line a massive roar fills blackened skies
Deploy your blood shredder and take some lives tonight
Believe us to be heroes
In a war so meaningless
Terror knows no glory
Stop and do not pretend
All of our lives we search
And by death of others we know?
This pitiful life is cursed
To the blackest of ends I must go
Only the dead have seen the end of war
Roam throughout the land
Lead by the darkest of commands: kill'em all
From the front line a massive roar fills blackened skies
Deploy your blood shredder and take some lives tonight
Fighting all the wars all alone and on your own
Serious mental illness waiting for you to get home
All the damage you haven't done; waiting for the kill
Lurking in the kindergarten
Shooting at everyone, firing at will
Night's destruction
