[By L. Skov, T. Nefer]

Trace of terror - it is time
Trace of terror - left behind
Leave this world - on your own
Leave this world - never alone
The battlefield seems so far away
Nothing can stop you or block your way
Certain in your mind you rest your case
For the greater good and for the human race
Cold eyes reflects a life time of sadness
A life of despair from broken souls
Always remember the pain which you bear
Wherever you go I will follow you
Trace of terror - what is the course?
Trace of terror - is it yours?
Leave this world - you've got nothing left
Leave this world - leave their death
Do not obey the orders you take
Deny their rules and turn away
Your life is our own - remember this
Just walk the line - here's nothing you will miss

Shot down in cold blood - you tried to run away
You tried to prevent a tragedy
These revelations all came to you too late
The deed is now done - nothing can be changed
All is pitch black and my pain has gone away
Still I see clear as it was in the day
Embraced at night by the shadows of a tear
Hell awaits my life - I die without fear
