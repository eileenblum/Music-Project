[By L Skov, T. Nefer, B. Drastrup]

Chaos in a world of shattered souls and
False believes encouraging a fading hope
Keep the world in a suffocating grasp
Incompetent humanity - a mindless mass
Take your life and die but you cannot escape
Death is always the answer to your prayers
No matter what the question might be
Despair is a feeling you share
With all those who too care
Resulting in: deadly and bleeding nightmares
I feel no hope. I hear no prayers
Has god forsaken this world?
Why are we here? when does this end?
An empty future, is this worth still fighting for?

Out - running in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out killing on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out - bombing from the skies
A thousand more will die
You take so many lives
Now its time to stand and fight
Now the war is a beginning to the end
Thoughtless, self destruction
If you worship your gods and do as they command
Then nothing is left to be
Shoot to kill or shoot to live
It does not matter now 'cause
Death is stalking - hell is calling
The terror in your eyes defines your life
Out - running in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out killing on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out - bombing from the skies
A thousand more will die
You take so many lives
Now it's time to stand and fight
Order from chaos and shattered souls
Shot to die and left alone
Hordes of soldiers march to kill
No one cares about human will
You did nothing and stepped aside
You let the slaughter take place tonight
Why did you do this?
Where will you run to now?
I can't take this I cant take this any-
I can't take this. I can't take this anymore
Out - running in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out killing on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out - bombing from the skies
A thousand more will die
You take so many lives
Now its time to stand and fight
