So what did you expect
That I would walk away and leave everything behind
You have betrayed me once more
We're standing on a sinking ship
This time its over
This time were done
So what did you expect
That I would walk away and leave everything behind
You have betrayed me once more
But I will put an end to your masquerade
Your words remind me
Why I despise you so much
I would love to burry you
Burry you beneath my feet
You destroyed everything
Everything that I have ever loved
I have loved
How does it feel to know
You've destroyed everything I know
Everything I know
So what did you expect
That I would walk away and leave everything behind
You have betrayed me once more
We're standing on a sinking ship
This time its over
This time were done
We're over
I'll never forgive you for what you've done
Guilt may tear you apart till your nothing but a hollow shell
I will put an end to your masquerade
When this cold steel meets your flesh
Your venomous words remind me
Why I despise you so much
I'll never forgive you for what you've done
