The truth is what we'll have to face
And we're running out of time

Running from the here and now, here and now
After al that happened escaping is easier then letting go, then letting go
We're forever bound to this tragedy, to this tragedy

We can never escape our destiny
We're caught in an endless maze

Running from the here and now, here and now
After al that happened escaping is easier then letting go, then letting go
We're forever bound to this tragedy, to this tragedy

We can never escape our destiny
There's no way out, no way out
We can never escape our destiny
There's no way out, no way out

Trying to find our way home
Trying to find our way home

Everything will change in the end
You've got to find your way home
You've got to find your way home
Make your own fate

To this tragedy
Running from the here and now, here and now

We can never escape our destiny
We're caught in an endless maze, in an endless maze
There's no way out

We can never escape our destiny
There's no way out, no way out
We can never escape our destiny
There's no way out, no way out
