"Lost in a dream...
Drowning in the eyes
Of a statue who dreamt a little dream of me...
Incipiunt hic tenebrarum lectiones secundae,
Cum Lucifer receptaculum noctis evasus,
Demergitur in undis somniorum suorum...
...Quem statua observat.

But here there is no light."

[English Translation:]

Here begin the second lectures of darkness,
As Lucifer becomes the chalice of the night.
He drowns in the sea of his dreams...
... Him, whom the statue beholds.
