At night we were drowning
Mesmerized by your songs
We were lured
Into the maze of your love

When the drop of life bursts
An ocean of joy
And freedom for the newborn sailor

Through aeons of time
Our eyes were smothered by the sun
Now even in the dark we see ...
Wanton light steers us no more
Eyeless we sailed

When the drop of life bursts
An ocean of joy
And freedom for the newborn sailor
