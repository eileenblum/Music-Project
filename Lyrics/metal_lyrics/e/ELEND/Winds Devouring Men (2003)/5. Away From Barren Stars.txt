Worse than mourning
Disdain, dances at my side

Another wasted day
And shadows stained your silent face
Yet
Weary with passions
The sevenfold seas were young

Your sibilant eyes, bloodied with tears

I'll pray for you, I'll stay away from barren stars

The land is just an ocean of fear
And your love has vanished
