I became the great deciever
To see what fair eyes still can't see ...

A tear in every sea
A fragment of light exhausted

Vision, is all that matters
To a wayward traveller

Through centuries of burning
We have waited so long
Cloaked in a serpent's skin
From the portal, I was calling you

You lay me, in the dust of the dead

A swan in agony
