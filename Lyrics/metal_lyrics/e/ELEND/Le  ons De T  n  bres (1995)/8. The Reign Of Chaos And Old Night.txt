Abject and lost lay these legions,
COvering the flood
Under amazement of their hideous change.
Lucifer, above the rest, stood like a tower.
He calls his servants, host and knights.
Horrid appeal, at which the Universal host up sent
A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.
