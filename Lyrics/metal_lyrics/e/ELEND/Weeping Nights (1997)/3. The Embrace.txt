From your embrace
Where sleeps an eternal Night,
Let me emerge and sing this Elendian plaint,
For all the pearls have vanished that shone before.
Teach me in pure melodious songs to move
With sirenian might
These hearts who died in joy.
Lord, let the soul of music tune my voice
For death and despair have soiled the shores of Heaven.
Ah! Let the soul of music tune my voice
And cast down with sin oppressed I'll be longing
For your embrace.
