Dying into a dance,
Dismal the tide of woes,
Your eyes still can't see
A wave in the foaming streams
Turned loose our prayings son.

The crawling snakes of massacre mesmerize the worn-out.

Blood And Grey Skies Entwined

We gathered the first drop after the bite
And spilled the poison
Over
The earth.
The taste of rain was bitter
The crawling snakes of massacre mesmerize the worn-out.
Blood and grey skies entwined.
