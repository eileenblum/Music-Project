Struggling upon the Threshold that leads from sanity to nightmare
Not knowing that your altered perception blackens the Freedom
Of your Terrible Mind
Of the very existence
you're fighting to deny

Haunted by murderous demons and guided by your own fears
You seek haven between the shadows of your true enemy

Of your only enemy
The one that lies
behind your frightful eyes
