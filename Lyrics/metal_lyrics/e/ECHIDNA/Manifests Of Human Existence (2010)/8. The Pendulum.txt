What a marvelous beauty that is
That of an incomprehensible abyss
As astonishing as the sun,
yet so hideous in its vagueness

What an agony to exist
Balancing between matter and nihil
As simple as the feel of the wind
Yet vast like a cosmic ocean

How the subconscious is able to provide
A layer that severs perception from nothing
An amalgam of incoherent entities
that form the essence of life
Dwelling on the brink of void

In the shade of the eyelid
A scarlet shape crawls
Inside the eyes a projection
An organic machine
slowly molding reality

The pendulum demands
To cherish the relentless pace of time
Amidst eleven dimensions
Matter collapses to the glint of a moment

The failure of the abyss
It's inability to judge
beyond the terms of its likeness
Bound to its very being
An eagle untethered in its cage

Pondering upon the human potential
The social reflection of the abyss
Condemned to be biased against its own existence
Still meant to transcend its natural limits

In the shade of the eyelid
A scarlet shape crawls
Inside the eyes a projection
An organic machine
slowly molding reality
