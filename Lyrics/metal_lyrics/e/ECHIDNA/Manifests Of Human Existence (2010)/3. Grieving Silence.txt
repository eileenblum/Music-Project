Defaced you stand
a single nobody in a mindless crowd
Surrounded by a system
where corruption triumphs
Here every suspended solid
rests on top of our affliction

Grieving silence
a lament to our own death!

Shut down your eyes and ears
protect them from the truth
Avoid reality to suit your pitiful life
An alliance of deception
a conformist masterplan!

Grieving silence
a lament to our own death!

Ignorance pawn
You care for nothing, but your self
Just for what prosperity demands
But you can smash their greed for power
Just open the mouth and speak out loud
