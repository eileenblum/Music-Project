In fathomless depths
There where logic dissolves
into the obscurity
of instinct-driven behaviour
One challenges oneself
to defy

From non-canonical patterns
Randomly picked from endless streams
Massive figures are formed to recreate
Facts that already exist
or not...

In fathomless depths
One's dreams are manufactured
One shall silently surrender to them
For dreams are the most
Kafkaesque manifestation
of oneself
