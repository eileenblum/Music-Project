Noir and moments of change
Shadows swim in the lakes of chaos
As I redeem the hopes in my grasping hand
I feel my glacial prison quiver!
Questions? Swarming through my mind
These words descent from desolate realms
Seeking ways to reach my devastation

Forlorn I have foreseen the dark
Shall dwell in the fortress of past

Whispering n your ears
Holding the back of your neck
Judging their infinite lies
Tempting your self for the end
In my moments of faith
My aura kneels to embrace me
I subtracted life with my grasping hand
as I perceive my prison... Shatter!

Forlorn I have foreseen the dark
Shall dwell in the fortress of past
Forlorn I have foreseen the dark
Whispers in the dark

A window with no view
The Lies they told you were true
Their love gave birth to a spark
yet almost torn apart... Whispers in the dark
