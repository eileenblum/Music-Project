The images are all the same
A moving spiral that devours
All consciousness and truth
An altered state of mind
Experiment on mass hypnosis
Your own inescapable inertia!

Go on and spit your lies
Seduce / Provoke / Defile
Every precious truth...
a rosebud in your dangerous hands

Under a storm of information
Minds succumb to gradual possession
To be used and then reformed
A passive service for the "righteous"
A place for the void to rest
A means for the incapable... to rule!

Go on and spit your lies
Seduce / Provoke / Defile
Every precious truth...
a rosebud in your dangerous hands

Entertainment through torture
The infliction of psychosomatic pain
deifying every suspended solid
A basis for corruption to spread
A method to discard all guilt
A reason for the useless to exist
