An essence drawn beneath the surface
Coiled into human form a Human Serpent
Craved its form for human flesh
But still inside a rigid reptile

Until we die
force fed we swallow
a vicious way of living

Born from the seed of deception
Came this unexpected guest,
a human serpentine
Initiation to an eerie convention
The feelings unfaithful
and unable to feel the change

Until we die
force fed we swallow
a vicious way of living

No escape from materialistic frontiers
Now everything gets a whole new meaning
Hunted but still straw
Initiation and grinding infestation!

Encounters between those who stand for faith
As everything shatters,
blood gives a warm flow
Terror but nothing to fear
The thirst finally won the test
no hope to stand against

Until we die
force fed we swallow
a vicious way of living

Venomous serpentine and evil
outdated seals contain our ego!
