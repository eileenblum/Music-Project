Theories of superior existence
An ancient relic of human vanity
A trigger for abnormal social behaviour
Faith is a mind disease
An instrument of torture
Forcing man to suppress his own instincts

The nature of Cain
was the final design
for the creation of man
Lurking in the most secret paths
of the human subconscious
the Dogma of Cain

Faith in God killed the trust to man
As Cain did to his own brother
The best seller of cheap hope
In a sick bargain of life denial

The nature of Cain
was the final design
for the creation of man
Lurking in the most secret paths
of the human subconscious
the Dogma of Cain

and there...
within the silent vertigo of Babel's fall
Arose the fear for the uncertainty of demise
And upon it were built
churches and temples

The nature of Cain
was the final design
for the creation of man
Lurking in the most secret paths
of the human subconscious
the Dogma of Cain
