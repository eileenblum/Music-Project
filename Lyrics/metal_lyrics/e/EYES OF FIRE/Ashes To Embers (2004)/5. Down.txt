Wounds don't heal right when carved from the inside.
Scars don't go away not even in time.
I wanted to be what you needed from me.
You're blind but when will you see?
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
It's cold and it's dark and I don't want to feel it anymore.
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
And I don't want to know.
Cries go unheard when laid upon deaf ears.
An embrace once shared, replaced by a cold stare.
I would give you my heart, it's worth everything.
You're blind but when will you see?
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
It's cold and it's dark and I don't want to feel it anymore.
It feels like I've been down here one too many times before.
And I don't want to know.
Why does it have to be like this?
Why does it have to feel like this?
Why does it have to end like this?
I feel like I've died, I've been down so long.
When I've never been so alive.
