I'm wasting time here.
I'm hopelessly waiting: For someone or something new.
I'm still here.
Hopelessly waiting: Waiting for something, something or someone.
You were the one who was there from the start.
So where were you when it all feel apart?
You were the one who was there all along.
So how can these feelings I get be so wrong.
I don't know if I'll ever be here again
I don't know if I'll ever be here again.
I don't know if I'll ever feel you again.
But until the end I'm hopelessly waiting for you.
I'm losing time here.
I'm hopelessly waiting: For something or someone new.
I've lost it all.
Hopelessly waiting: Waiting for something, something or someone.
You were the one who was there from the start.
When I needed you most you were far from the heart.
Yes, I've fallen from grace and I've lost once again.
Now it all falls apart, now it comes to an end.
I don't know if I'll ever be here again.
I don't know if I'll ever feel you again.
I don't know if I'll ever be here again.
But until the end I'm hopelessly waiting for you.
There will come a time yes I know.
A time for you.
I don't know if I'll ever be here again.
I don't know if I'll ever feel you again.
I don't know if I'll ever be here again
But until the end I'm hopelessly waiting for you:
