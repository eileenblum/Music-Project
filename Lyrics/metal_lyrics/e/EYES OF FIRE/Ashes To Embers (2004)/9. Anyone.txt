It's alright now, if you don't need me.
It's alright now, that I can't see you.
Well it's now alright for me to be a victim of your tragedy.
It's not alright for me anymore.
But is there anyone there for me?
I know, I know there's gotta be someone out there somewhere.
There for me. I know, I know.
Well is there anyone there for me?
I'm good enough to be.
There's gotta be someone out there somewhere, there for me.
It's alright now because I don't need this.
It's alright now because I don't want this.
Well it's not alright that you don't see that I was good enough to be.
