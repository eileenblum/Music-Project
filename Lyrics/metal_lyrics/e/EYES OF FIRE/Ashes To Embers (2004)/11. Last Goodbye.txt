Seeing through my eyes.
See your life, selfish and cold, I know.
Seeing through my eyes.
See my life fall down this hole, I know.
Beautiful eyes bring me lies.
Seeing through my eyes.
See my life, a heartbroken soul, I know.
Seeing through my eyes.
Feel me heart but don't let me go.
Don't you let me go!
Beautiful eyes bring me lies.
Through your eyes, I see lies.
Cold from inside and it's my last goodbye.
Until the end I'll feel this way and until my dying day.
I swear I've never been so betrayed.
Until the end I'll feel this way and until my dying day.
I swear I will never feel the same!
When you start believing those beautiful dreams, you will know it's over.
It's not as it seems.
When you start believing those beautiful lies, then you know it's over.
It's you last goodbye.
