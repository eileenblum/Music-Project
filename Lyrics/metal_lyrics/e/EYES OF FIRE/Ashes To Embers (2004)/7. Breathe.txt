Where do we go? Where do we go? From here?
I crawl to you. Through fields of scorn. From here
I call to you. My arms outstretched. From here
Breathe, what has become of this life
Life, I have waited for you
Breathe, nothing will ever become
Out, of the burdens I went through for you
I tried to love but where were you?
Breathe, I have waited for you
Life, will she ever come for me
Breathe, I can no longer try
Out, to be who you want me to be
Breathe, breathe life, breathe, breathe out
I tried to love but where were you?
I can't believe I'm here again, still alone
I gave you all I had in me, never again
Fade away this life from me, breathe out
