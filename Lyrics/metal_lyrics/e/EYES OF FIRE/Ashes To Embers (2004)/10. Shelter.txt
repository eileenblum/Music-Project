Look in me. Can you see that some things should never be?
There's no shelter, so this is really me.
When you look in my eyes you see something that's just not right.
There's no shelter, so this is really me.
When I fall once again. I will fall like there is no end.
There's no shelter, so this is really me,
Crush the walls, built together.
Piece by piece, like no other.
Now you see what it's done to me.
There's no shelter, so this is really me.
Crush the walls, built together.
Piece by piece, like no other.
Now you see what it's done to me!
