So sick and tired of getting my dreams stolen right from under me.
So many times, is this all there is? There's got to be more to this.
Rid me of this burned free me from this endless pain
This world is leaving me empty.
Leaving me empty
So you see me here, I've lost again. I feel you feeding off my suffering.
Take one last look into these eyes. The product of western skies.
Rid me of this burned free me from this endless pain
This world is leaving me empty.
Leaving me empty.
I'm at the end of my days and I don't feel as I should.
I don't feel like I should. I never felt like I could.
I don't feel like I should. I never had what I could.
I'm at the end of my days and I don't feel as I should.
