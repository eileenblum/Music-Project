Broken wings don't fly away.
Is this what you want me to say?
Caught up in your web once again.
This time I just can't get away.
All I ever wanted was to be in this world.
Alongside of you in this life.
All I wanted from you was one more time.
One more!
One more time I believe in the lie.
Broken dreams don't fade away.
The pain only lingers and stays.
I've seen this before and I know it too well.
This time I will make no mistakes.
All I never wanted was to be in this world.
Alongside of you in this life.
All I wanted from you was one more time.
One more!
One more time I get kicked to the side.
One more!
One more time I bleed for you.
One more time, one more lie.
