Feel all my suffering.
Fear what it's doing to me now.
You're gonna see a side of me you have never seen.
Walk away from me or feel what is gonna be now.
For all it's worth now all I can say is this:
For all it's worth now I can say you never knew me.
No!
For all it's worth now, you never knew me.
It wasn't worth it, you never knew me.
Once so lost in my mind.
The anger burns deep inside.
Remnants of a callous life.
You're gonna see a side of me you have never seen.
Walk away from me or feel what is gonna now.
No!
