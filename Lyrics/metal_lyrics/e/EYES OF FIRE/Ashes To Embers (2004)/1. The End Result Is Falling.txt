Here I am left here holding this empty heart
You reach inside and try to feel what's left of me
I fall back to the sea and try to forget this dream
I peel the skin that holds me here inside of you
I fall back to the sea and all I have left is this black heart
I can't feel these arms around me
I can hear your voice inside me
(Release me from this empty lie, I don't want to feel this anymore)
(Let go from this cell, I never wanted to feel this again)
I didn't ask for this. I didn't try for this. I never asked for this.
I never wanted this inside me
