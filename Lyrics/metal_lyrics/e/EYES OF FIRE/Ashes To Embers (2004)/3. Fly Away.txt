You fly away to your heaven so far away with another soul in your arms
Fly away my angel fly away and leave me here to stay
Leave me be my angel leave me here to wither away
All alone my angel with nothing but this black heart
Fly away my angel fly away and leave me here to stay
You fly away to a heaven so far away with another soul in your arms
I wither away
Fly away my angel and leave me here to stay
Take these dreams my angel take them from me and cast them away
Throw away my angel this life you gave to me
Fly away my angel and leave me here to stay
This felt so real
Your love you gave to me
Left behind once again
Tonight I'll fade away
Fly away...
From me
My angel
My heart
My love
My everything.
