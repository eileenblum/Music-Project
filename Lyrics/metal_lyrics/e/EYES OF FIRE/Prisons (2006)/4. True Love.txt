She's coming. Can you feel her? She's warming and growing.
Listen to her and you'll feel her. Her hand caresses my life into a warm and blissful world.
I feel her cold steel in my arms. Fall into the same routine.
Over and over, there's no escapse from this trap.
Tried and failed once-again. Wrap myself around her steel hand.
This time I know. Tomorrow will fade away. This time I know.
Failure will end today. It's love inside of her.
Her steel is kissing, inviting, and welcoming. Please don't fail me today.
Push your steel through my flesh. Show us your power to save.
Please don't fail me today.
