Bring me my salvation now. Tearing away all the restraints.
It has to be, it's the only way. Finding a way to break through thie weight.
It has to be, it's the only way. Can you save me from myself?
My heart-strings have snapped. I collapse in myself.
It has to be, it's the only way. The black turns to red. It's all I can see. There has to be some other way.
