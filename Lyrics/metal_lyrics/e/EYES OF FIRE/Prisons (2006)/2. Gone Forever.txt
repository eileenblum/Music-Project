Watching as my world slips away. Still holding on to what I used to be.
I never meant no harm. I never hurt no one. I never knew it would end this way.
Watching as my world slips away. All at once it is gone forever.
Say goodbye to me forever, if forever feels like this.
I don't want to see tomorrow, if tomorrow feels like this.
I was born to cross the line. Born to suffer. For all the things I never was...
For those who thought I never would be...
Erase me from your memory. I don't want it. I don't need it. If it's gone forever.
Love is never gone forever. Love is never gone for good.
