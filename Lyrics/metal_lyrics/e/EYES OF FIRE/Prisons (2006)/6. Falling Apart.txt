Once in your life there will come a time when your world comes alive and you become part of this grand design.
Once in your life there will come a time when your hope is so bright, then it all fades away in the blink of an eye. It's been gone so long.
Straight through the heart now I'm falling apart.
Everything that's holding us together is falling apart.
Everything that's keeping together is falling apart.
Once in your life you may realize that your one greatest love, it was nothing.
It was nothing but lies.
Once in your life you may realize when it's all said and done, you have go to let go of the pain that's inside. It's been there so long.
Don't go away. From now until the end I will be here for you. Don't go away. I will always remain. I will be here for you.
