Does it hurt you? Do you feel pain? Does it hurt you to be here with me?
Does it hurt you? Can you feel pain? Does it hurt you?
Because I need this for me. Does it hurt you like it's hurting me, to see you let go and just fade away?
I know I've hurt you. It's time to let go of all that you are and all that you know.
Walk away from everything and everyone. It's all said and done. I feel I've known this for far too long.
