I wish you the best through all these hard times.
You know they're coming right down for you. I wish you could make it through all these hard times.
I know they're coming right now for you. This is my life.
You see my eyes and the sadness in them.
Now you are dead to the world and you are all that I know. All that you are is all that I know.
A look from inside and it's time to let go.
Dead to the world is all that you are and it's all that I know.
