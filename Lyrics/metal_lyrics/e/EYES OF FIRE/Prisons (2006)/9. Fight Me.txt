Crossed the line once again. Come on make it stop!
Over and over will this ever end? I've had it with you.
Pushing and scratching and digging into my skin. Now I feel this burn. You pushed me to the brink this time.
Now you must burn. Come on! You want a fight?
Bring it! I want a fight with you. Come on! You want a fight?
This time there's only one way to get through. Fist to bone and knife to heart.
There's a bullet aimed at you. Broken bottles cutting your skin.
You should have seen this coming. I told you time and time again.
Now it's time to deal. Plotting your demise this time.
I will enjoy this end. Fight me! I'm rid of you for good.
