Wake in a haze. Was all this a dream? Searching for answers beyond my reach.
Over and over the same answers gained. Nothing makes sense with all that I see.
Blood on the ground and blood everywhere. How could this happen? This can't be me.
Torment and rage consumes this soul. The final exit is beyond our control.
Broken glass all through this body. Blood-stained sheets.
Scars on my body. Gouged-out eyes. I feel this rage. Broken bones.
You had this coming. I feel it. You can't take it away.
Flows through me like water down a stream. Why is there blood? This consumes you.
