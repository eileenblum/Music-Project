There is one thing I feel from within. I know what it is I just can't explain.
I've given everything I have for this life.
I'm breaking down from the inside out. I feel the life drain from my hell.
I feel what it is to burn from the soul. I will ascend from the ashes again.
Forgive me, bring the end. Bleed from your sacrifice.
Burn from the fire inside. There is one thing I know from within.
You know what it is, no need to explain.
I will never give up, never give in but my time is wearing thin.
The truth makes it hard to carry this heart. Sometimes I feel it but it just seems too far.
Through all the black my soul will transcend.
Forgive me this must end. When the pain finally starts to subside.
When all that you know has curled up and died. When all the good things you know end.
It's the way the world works here, my friend.
