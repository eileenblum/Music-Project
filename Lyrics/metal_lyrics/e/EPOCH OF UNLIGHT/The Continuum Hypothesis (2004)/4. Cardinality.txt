"Bending thoughts to the sky
I choose the path my will to try,
And through it all the night."

Frozen seeds of finite thoughts barren in less minds.
The untilled planes of higher thought-a waste in midnight sky
Silver beams on eddied streams the foolish wish to cross
The arrogance of ignorance while another watches on

Days to weeks as months will span
The epoch lengths of mortal man
To further seek the all

A flawed approach to reason what has wandered must be lost
Set upon a legions task with barely light of sun
A dimming mind in motion is as clay to one more skilled
Providing folly for the one that was caught from within

Layer upon layer unbound in time and space-seeking the naught within the all
A Looking glass spanning what was and is to be
And in it all a piece of me!

Impulsive drive to categorize the time invariant night
Misapplied derivatives convoluted in pride
End point limitations to a limitless existence
Folding back the edges to a point at which I claim

A furtive move to elude the frozen barbs of times
So washed away, the minor player in his role in mine
As guided through another's fate to seek the path forgotten
So guided through another's fate to seek the path verboten
And in it all a piece of me!

Blinding Infinities the naught becomes the norm
Receding boundaries to night's apprentice
A claim laid, now lies in wait
A call, a call to those that might!
