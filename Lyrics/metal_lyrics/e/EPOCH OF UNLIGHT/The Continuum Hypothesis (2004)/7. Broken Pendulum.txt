An inevitable cycle structures fail to stand tall upon this broken Pendulum
Descend into the great fall with arms to govern and minds to crawl
Beneath this frame frail and small

Grinding teeth and cracking bones
Metal splinters and pins
Money to dust gold into rust
And everything in between will die with time

Industrial soil erosion craters fill with blood
Rivers of hydraulic fluid form canyons below
Filling the air with sounds cutting metal

Cranks turn and gears move
Cracking the surface aged and weathered
Her tears will burn the face you'll fail to recognize when she's in pain

Growing withered and tired
Charred from the sun's poison
Burning sight and melting our Future
