Faster... footsteps fall upon Swain's lane
Echoing... the frenzied turn to flight
Alone.... Careless youths caution less
Indurate... the sallow will carries on

Hallowed grounds for a hallowed home
Deep Within the Highgate crypt

Privy by a chanced encounter fated by the glimpse
The bitter loss of innocence upon the crimson lips

A year ahead... the lonely path is tread again
A union made... and broken in the night
Fears allayed... by thoughts of each and future plans
Fears displayed... as darker thoughts are shown

Hallowed grounds for a hallowed home
Deep Within the Highgate crypt

Held in thrall while the sweeter flesh is tried
Filling the warm core with my essence

Always the same, to make a name, the "others" came
A trophy of the highest order, to bring an end to the one
The source of all, will not fall, what time itself ignored
The folly of man to hunt a shade within the night

Set to work on a moonlit night
In the haze of a predawn mist
Not a sound but the clanging gate
Swinging free by the northern wall

FIRE IN THE NIGHT!
Lesser ones are put down
As further into the crypt they seek
With no sign and the thickening smoke
They retreat to seal the way

BURIED WITHIN THE VAULT!

Fresh walls of cement and kneblasch permeate
Premature satisfaction as the hunters......... they abate
Known to me alone this manse of mine and all its ways
A safer route free from taint and burning rays

Safety... deep within barren soil
Deeply.... dreaming of the next embrace
Castled... and always one move ahead
Hunting... the hunters using them as pawns

Hallowed grounds for a hallowed home
Deep Within the Highgate crypt

Privy by a chanced encounter fated by the glimpse
The bitter loss of innocence upon the crimson lips
