Solar zenith long surpassed
The waning light in lunar path
Leads the westward lagging edge
In a crimson hue

While the few belabor still
The greater mass their bliss reveals
Credulous, indolent flesh
Dulled by time

Shadows under guise of a passing day
Shadows of loathsome time and odious place
Shadows in the Stygian caves forlorn
Shadows of an ancient night

Analemma in contempt
The one and seven nine descent
Where light begins its wayward course
Felt by those below

For in the stead of absent rays
The scintillating, cerulean haze
Accents the ambient gelidity
Spread from northern plains

Shadows under guise of a passing day
Shadows of loathsome time and odious place
Shadows in the Stygian caves forlorn
Shadows of an ancient night

The fluid spread of tenebrous mist
As blanket to the fertile fringe

Freed from the confines, the elliptical-avail, the beginning of aphelion the force that none may quell.
The turning of a world, the balance was destroyed, a caliginous return to the primal void.
The upper plain long denied by light, the former claims of what was once by might!
Resurgence, an out flow from wells long thought dry oozing into night!

"Deeper, deeper, deeper, down I lie"
From the calcite depths unknown slowly I arise

The tyranny of persecution, the curse of broken oaths,
The condemning of interment... where others would lose hope
Tenacious, the lust left to fester on the Cimmerian recursive dreams of those below the dawn
Banished by the sulphorous gaze, no longer holding sway,
As final rays expire so in legion they awake.
From the deepest sumps to cesspools far below they arrive as innumerable shades over all

Locked below the stagnant earth the stale air permeates
Through fallen stone and earth the amalgam makes its way

Another fool dispatched
Another's end for sport
Iniquity's return in crepuscular glory!

Shadows under guise of passing day
Shadows of loathsome time and odious place
Shadows in the Stygian caves forlorn
Shadows of the ancient night!

Another fool dispatched
Another's end for sport
Iniquity's return in crepuscular glory!
