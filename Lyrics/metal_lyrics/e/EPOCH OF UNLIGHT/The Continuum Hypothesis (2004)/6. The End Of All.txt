Blinding where it tore the sky and fell from cosmos grasp
Blinding where it fed the lust and steals the thought of man
Blinding where it seeds deceit in the waning lure of light
Blinding where it seals the fate - bringing the end of all!

Not to be heard, not to be seen another quest in darker dreams
A slate devoid of yesterday now makes his way
Deeper through the catching limbs the forest path seems closing in
Footsteps on the foreign trail fall by vestigial engram

"Eternal return into the night
Disambiguation in the Unlight"

Stranger here, yet stranger still the underlying pull of will
The source of a recursive force since the dawn of time
Ineffably at Haven's end, the fading rays as light rescinds
Sets the stage once again for the final act

"Confrontation, the two arrive
Comprehension the two collide"

The dichotomy embodies the whole and provides the key
Gathering on a starless night as in times of old
Always the endless struggle played out the same
A never-ending conflict across infinite planes

Across Infinite planes

"An ever-changing background
To the ouroboros tale"

Immured in forgotten woods locked in eternal embrace
Yellow feral eyes linked with a crimson gaze
Glowing orbs seething, a time-immemorial lust
The sylva air permeates with the sounds of

The sounds of bitter steel!

"The curtain draws as the dawn arrives
A new champion stands"

Blinding where it tore the sky and fell from cosmos grasp
Blinding where it fed the lust and steals the thought of man
Blinding where it seeds deceit in the waning lure of light
Blinding where it seals the fate - bringing the end of all!

Not to be heard, not to be seen another quest in darker dreams
The lone survivor makes his way from dark woods path
Indifferent to the battle's end, one day the paths will cross again
When Legatee and champion meet by fate's design

"Eternal return into the night
Disambiguation in the Unlight"
