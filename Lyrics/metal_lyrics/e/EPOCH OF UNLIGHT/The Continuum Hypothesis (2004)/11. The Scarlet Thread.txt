Hunting the hunters, the cold justice of wrath
Avenging those that strayed onto a darker path
Fallen lays another prize, this night-quest drawn to end
Disposing in a manner fit, with no hope to ascend.

Each day ends the same I follow through
The door my will alone conceives and yields to form
Retracing my life's strand through the naught
Where twisted colors taint the metaphysical hue

An ancient destiny scrolling through my mind
With access to the Chronosphere I pursue them into time
In a place where thoughts echo and equations carry weight
I seek the source within the source as key to my fate

A unified infinity derived from chaos trace
I track the change in the line of man
To shift the balance - a return to cerulean haze
I seek the end to the scarlet thread

Further into time a crimson glow is felt
It guides me through the night
Navigating Infinity's seas
To another scene in time!

Hunger in the night
The primal force urges on

As if by fate the other one appears.
In a path known only to feral eyes
With force the flesh-honed gauntlet ends the act.
Always the same since the fall.

Each slowing breath as though my own.
I probe the reeling mind.

A line blurred without distinction
Spiraling through the twisted knots.
Clarity's disillusionment.
This path returns to me!

Further into time a crimson glow is felt
It guides me through the night
Navigating Infinity's seas
To another scene in time!

An ancient destiny scrolling through my mind
With access to the Chronosphere I pursue them into time
In a place where thoughts echo and equations carry weight
I seek the source within the source as key to my fate

A unified infinity derived from chaos trace
I am but an Ouroboros in time
To shift the balance - a return to cerulean haze
I seek to end - the scarlet thread in me!
