[Lyrics: Losicco '95]

Argentum Chains, Blind My Eyes
With Silver Spikes, I'm Crucified
Ignorant Fools! Upon This Pyre Am I To Burn?
You Can Not Win For Life's To Short For You To Learn
I Am Immortal And Shall Be When All Is Not
I See The Flesh To Life And Then To Ground Upon Which It Rots
Within The Night, A Tribe Revolts
(I Was) Caught From Behind (With) A Kneblasch Bolt
Now Return To A Scene Of Foolish Pride
A Camp Surrounds A Fire Whose Fueled By What Was Flesh Of Mine
The Meek Pray, The Timid Shield Their Eyes
A Brilliant Flame Reflects Upon The Chains Held Fast Inside
A Pool Of Essence And Dripping Fats
Seep Into The Charred Grass
What Light Rejects Can Not Pass
I Will Rise From The Ash
Taint And Earth Combine
As Nature Of My Will
With Years Between The Flames And Now
A Wounded Tribesman Nears
His Lifeblood Issues Forth
Into My "Resting Ground"
And Occupying His Vacant Shell
I Walk The Earth Again
I Am Immortal And Shall Be When All Is Not
I See The Flesh To Life And Then To Ground Upon Which It Rots
I Rise, I Am The Immortal Crucified
I Rise, I Am The Immortal Crucified
I Rise, I Am The Immortal Crucified
I Rise, Your F***Ing Light Has Died
I Rise, I Am The Immortal Crucified
I Rise, I Am The Immortal Crucified
I Rise, I Am The Immortal Crucified
I Rise, Your F***Ing Light Has Died
