[Lyrics:  LoSicco'96]

Once upon a star-less night
Within my sky fell rays of light
(Who) chanced upon a path unknown
To all the path ends here.
To  approach me in my land
Is to release the strongest dam
Behind which oceans once duressed
now flow to Ever's end
I have become
What is now and ever shall be
The whisper of the timorous
The Scarlet hue of the blood
Once upon an ancient time
When still I searched for truth
I chanced to view a mortal's death
Upon  a cross a of wood
Now as crest is to wave
So time and time has passed:
And brought an end to my quest
Within this foreign land
Tu-mul-tu-ous
Years within the light
Are now dispatched with swollen eyes
And gaze towards blackened bliss
Be for me and only me:All that can forever be
A midnight cloak in ravens' black:To steal the jewels of night
The lens through which as willed to be:The scenes of all Infinity
Scroll through Chapter, line, and verse:And falls upon the page
(No More) Traveling through Space and Time
The spectrum collect lays at rest
Stasis again now restored
The day that the light was destroyed

Be for me and only me:All that can forever be
A midnight cloak in ravens' black:To steal the jewels of night

Again to face the marvelous mysteries
The Keys of Time are mine to employ
To view again in triumph of blasphemy
That which cannot shine anymore
Fetid Pallid Death
Cast down from the red mountain cliffs
Cosmic earth and clay
Upon your mother terra now lay
Ancient puissant hands
Now reach towards the heavens for all that I can
(The) Final mendacity
The End - a boundless lust may never see
[Hunger:] For the fruits of time
[Ethereal:] Ardor divine
[Clarity:] In a now darkened sky
The jewels of the night are mine!
I have become
What is now and ever shall be
The whisper of the timorous
The Scarlet hue of the blood
Tu-mul-tu-ous
Years within the light
Are now dispatched with swollen eyes
And gaze towards blackened bliss
The spectrum collect lays at rest
Stasis again now restored
The day that the light was destroyed!
