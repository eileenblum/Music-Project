[LYRICS: LoSicco '96]

Thirsting: With a lust that knows no bounds
I Ride:Into night and further into
Battle:With gauntlets raised and piercing cries
The infinite flow of her womb
The poignant spring from which all life doth bloom
Now matched alone by the myriad of bones
Broken seeping life, within the ravaged battled garden
(The) Mother:of man must now dry her wetted
Eyes for, it is upon her bitter sweet
Nectar, I wish to glut
And so doing ascend in might
With power over all I rule
(Ere the War)
Storms on horizon, the ancient hands of time align
Thunders toll the final hour of the mortals down below
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?!
Earth shakes and gales break upon the red and cracking clay
And spewing forth the raining slag begins to cleanse the fallen ones
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?!
You'll slowly burn
In hates black fire
Realize the lie
And the truth in pain
Choked by thorns
Blinded by "light"
The living lie
Burned Away
Father inequity, bending down on broken knee
The time of the fiery wrath has now come to pass
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?!

You'll slowly burn
In hates black fire
Realize the lie
And the truth in pain
Choked by thorns
Blinded by "light"
The living lie
Burned Away
The blaze that began in the soul of the one
Now sent upon the children of sun
The child of night has now his ascent
And crushed lay the feeble in death's stalwart grip
Searing phlogiston as child rises high
Blinks into darkness when through time he flies
And onto a new terra firma he stands
The cleanser of worlds has arrived!
I Ride:Into night and further into time!
