[Lyrics: LoSicco'95]

Argentum chains, blind my eyes
With silver spikes, I'm crucified
Ignorant fools!  Upon this pyre am I to burn?
You can not win for life's to short for you to learn
I am immortal and shall be when all is not
I see the flesh to life and then to ground upon which it rots
Within the night, a tribe revolts
(I was) caught from behind (with) a kneblasch bolt
Now return to a scene of foolish pride
A camp surrounds a fire whose fueled by what was flesh of mine
The meek pray, the timid shield their eyes
A brilliant flame reflects upon the chains held fast inside
A pool of essence and dripping fats
Seep into the charred grass
What light rejects can not pass
I will rise from the ash
Taint and earth combine
As nature of my will
With years between the flames and now
A wounded tribesman nears
His lifeblood issues forth
Into my "resting ground"
And occupying his vacant shell
I walk the earth again
I am immortal and shall be when all is not
I see the flesh to life and then to ground upon which it rots
I rise, I am the immortal crucified
I rise, I am the immortal crucified
I rise, I am the immortal crucified
I rise, Your fucking Light has died
I rise, I am the immortal crucified
I rise, I am the immortal crucified
I rise, I am the immortal crucified
I rise, Your fucking Light has died
