Festering half-rotten limbs
Slaughtered beyond recognition
Mixed with products of savage decapitation
I glance at my gore dripping apotheosis
Monstrous sculpture of abhorrence
Kneel before my creation
My lust becomes euphoric 
My head pierced with my victims moans
Intensely ejaculating
Abominable divinity
I'm peeling off the skin carving on a dead flesh
Slowly chewing vomiting and gobbling it again
Filled with stomach juices and belch
To devour is to become a part of my artistry
Asymmetric altar of disfigured beauty
Masticating the skinned
Sanctuary of deadly sin
Cannibalistic euphory the cult of desecration
