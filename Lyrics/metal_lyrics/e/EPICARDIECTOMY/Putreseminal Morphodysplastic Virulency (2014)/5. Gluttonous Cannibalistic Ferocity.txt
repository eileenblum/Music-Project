Can't fight the endless hunger like and abyss inside
Devours my twisted mind
Psychotic impulses pushing me for the hunt ferocious gluttony
Maniacal gore greed ripping the shacking convulsively resisting victim
With a barehand claws pulling off the flesh
Monstrous rapacity tearing off the limbs
Devastating the joints bones are crushing
I drown my teeth in soft juicy intestinals
Sucking out the sweet fecal mass of the guts
Choking on dismembered genitals 
Repugnant feast
On degenerated victim of necrotic debauchery
New target is seeked soon no escape
