Entortured pregnant whore
Just one piece of my collection
Tight to the table twitching in convulsions
Dissecreting the belly wide open cutting the womb
Repugnant piles of wasted infants
Warped pregnant bodies impaled in the row
Vulvar decortication placental disclosure
Cottecting the pipes to mutilated genital organs 
Releasing mephitic liquids into the rusted cesspool
Drowning myself and reveling in putrescent sewage
I cut my wrist and throat
Spasmodic premortal defecation
Gore is flowing from terrifying wounds
Swilling on that mass
Chocking on rancid clots
Finally dead and embalmed in mephitic placental substance
