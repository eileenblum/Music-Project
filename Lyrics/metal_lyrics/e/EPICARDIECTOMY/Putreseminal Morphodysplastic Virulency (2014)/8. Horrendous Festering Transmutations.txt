Filling my basement with worthless corporal body cases
Recollection the human components lifeless material
The tools and the operating table are ready
Don't hear my victims screams let the experiment begin
Bi-polar hemisphectomy compressing 
The cerebrum eyes are popping keeping my patient alive
Spasmodic entorturement sub-atomic extraterrestrial injection 
Objecting the reaction
Rapid contamination of intravenous system black bubbles are boiling out
Of exploding veins fluorescent aura around
The half-decimated ones 
Bursting arteries
Stomach is erupting with acid green mass
Unidentified hungry for mankind extinction creatures are rising
Horrendous transmutations 
Too late to decontaminate
