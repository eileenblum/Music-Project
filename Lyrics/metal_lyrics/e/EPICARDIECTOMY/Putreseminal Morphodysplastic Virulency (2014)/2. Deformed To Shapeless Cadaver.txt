She's caught in the dark traced for an hours
My stomach collapsed attacked by last portion
Of putrescent human meat
Hunger won't go away
Frenzy face punching till she's without move
Faced down choked with my boot 
She's now in my kingdom of everlasting pain
The tools of affliction are ready
Devastating her head with bludgeon
Can't stop beating the shit outta her
Intense body decimation
Rupturing her thorax breaking the ribs
Making the mass of broken bones and mingled intestines
I start devouring the sweet warm flesh
Sucking on gore and fractured bones
Gorging on guts stuffed with half-digested
Food and feces
Smearing this vomitous mush all over my body
As I walk away the shapeless cadaver is what I leave 
Slaughtered and brutally deformed
