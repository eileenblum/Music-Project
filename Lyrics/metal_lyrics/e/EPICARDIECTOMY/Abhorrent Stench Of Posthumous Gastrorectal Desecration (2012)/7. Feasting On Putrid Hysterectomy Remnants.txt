Staring at my new art 
Several bodies fall apart
Horrible stench magnetize me
Empty mind reflecting the scenes
Of basement butchery
Slashing amok dementia
Disemboweling the cleansed torsos of dirty whores
Lay down gutted inside out 
Trash body bags
Mockery on the bodies 
Shitting into the wounds of decapitation
Ulcerous anus fistfuck 
Feasting on a rancid regurgitated wombs
Masticating the putrid hysterectomy remnants
