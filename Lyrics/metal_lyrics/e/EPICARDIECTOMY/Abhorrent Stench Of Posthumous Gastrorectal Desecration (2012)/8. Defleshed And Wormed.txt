Soulless torso
Laying on the ground 
Fatal dismemberment
I'm watching the worms feasting 
Making thousands canals
Through defleshed carrion 
Just a few weeks ago a vital human body
Now without limbs
In inhuman position 
Full of decomposed urethral organs
Brutally smashed head 
Brain remains flow down the walls
I'm drowning my hands 
Into the pulsating putrescent mass
Covered with pus and gore 
Abhorrent stench of rotted body juices
After some time the worms are done nothing left
