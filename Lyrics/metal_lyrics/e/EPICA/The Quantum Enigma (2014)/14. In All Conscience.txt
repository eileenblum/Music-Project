[Digipack Additional Track]Allow me to write my final words
I can't stand this anymore

Hold me when the time has come
'Cause I don't want to be alone

In my heart you're still here
It's the bond that we share
I can feel you're around everywhere
Even though you are gone
Our spirit is strong
We're honouring all the work that you've done

When there's no chance for a defense
I'll have to bend and give it all

All that I've been standing for
Was an illusion after all

In my heart you're still here
It's the bond that we share
I can feel you're around everywhere
Even though you are gone
Our spirit is strong
We're honouring all the work that you've done

I'll see you somewhere again, away from all insanity
We can't beat injustice, now and for all
I'll see you somewhere again, away from humanity
We can't beat unfairness now on our own

Even though you are gone
Our spirit is strong
I've felt you around all along

In my heart you're still here
It's the bond that we share
I can feel you're around everywhere
Even though you are gone
Our spirit is strong
We're honouring all the work that you've done

I'll see you somewhere again, away from all insanity
We can't beat injustice, now and for all
I'll see you somewhere again, away from humanity
We can't beat unfairness now on our own
