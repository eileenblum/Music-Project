[Earbook Additional Track]Try and define eternity
No beginning and no end
A world upside down
Countless clouds on the ground
I'm a figment of my imagination

Hunt for tricks of light
Thoughts painting colourful dimensions

If we could roam through fantasies
No more dusk and no more dawn
Every little grain of sand shapes the endless land
Mirrors showing limitless reflections

Hunt for tricks of light
Thoughts painting new dimensions
You can make our time stand still
Come and read the sky
Fly with the wings of true emotion

And this time again
It won't be the same
Silent symphonies playing eternally
Every step I take, every bone I break
Every memory shares a symphony

Hunt for tricks of light
Thoughts painting new dimensions
You can make our time stand still
Come and read the sky
Fly with the wings of true emotion
