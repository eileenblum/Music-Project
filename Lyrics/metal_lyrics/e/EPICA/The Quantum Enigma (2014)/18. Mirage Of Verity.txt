[Japanese Additional Track]Hate me as I am
For what I stand for and achieve
Hate me as I am
For all the lies that you believe

Break the spell
Defeat the silence
We can't lose ourselves in reticence

Can't feel my heart
Can't feel my soul
All I have done has been controlled
It's time to break free

Can't live my life
Like this no more
All I have done has been ignored
It's time to break free

Hate me as I am
For all the wounds that I can't heal
Bring me down to justice
For the truth that I've revealed

Break the spell
Defeat the silence
We can't lose ourselves in retinence

Can't feel my heart
Can't feel my soul
All I have done has been controlled
It's time to break free

Can't live my life
Like this no more
All I have done has been ignored
It's time to break free

We cannot free ourselves
As long as
The truth won't get a chance
To break through pseudo-omniniscence

Can't feel my heart no more
Can't feel my soul
All I have ever done was mind controlled
Break out, be free
Can't live my life this way
I can't, no more
All I have ever done has been ignored
Break out, be free

Can't feel my heart
Can't feel my soul
All I have done has been controlled
It's time to break free

Can't live my life
Like this no more
All I have done has been ignored
It's time to break free
