[North American Bonus Track]You're eternal my love.
For me you're all there ever was.
Every limit overcome.
As we are tangled we are one.

Words are left unsaid burning in my head.
Now I only wish I could hold you again.
Being there with you I feel at ease.
Being there with you is all I ever need,
My one belief,
We share a common energy.
Iâve flown a far beyond the sea,
To find the other side of me.
Iâve waited long and patiently,Â 
To find the one to balance me.
To live without dubiety
This is my covenant to thee

Life feels empty, my love,
It pains me so to give you away.
Sentence untold never to unfold.
Now I only wish I could hold you again.
Being there with you I am whole again.
Being there with you is all I ever need,
My one belief,
We share a common energy.
Iâve flown a far beyond the sea,
To find the other side of me.
Iâve waited long and patiently,Â 
To live without dubiety
This is my covenant to thee

My belief.
My one belief.

Youâre all I need, my one belief.
The winds of time will carry me.
To live without dubiety
Donât let this ever end

[Chorus:]
We flown a far beyond the sea,Â 
To find each other finally.
Weâve waited long and patiently
To build a bridge between dualities
