[Lyrics by Simone Simons]

Black was the night when I did surrender
I did give in to my weakening sight
Now that I'm empty my dreams once were many
Soul's bitter cry to unleash the divine

When you think there's no way out
And all you see collides
Hope will in the end chase all your fears away

Fighting the source was not recommended
Trails of a wish were the hope to survive
Skins full ablazing release crystal gazing
All of it led to a deeper demise

When you think there's no way out
And no one comprehends
Hope will show your smile again

What I left behind
Another night
Of weary dreams, unravelling
What's been left behind
Another time
Where days of late are far away
Far away

Losing my reasons,
No lies to believe in
Left the obscure to
The means of escape

Core has been shaken,
There is no more pain to break me
Time has commenced and I long to awake

When you think there's no way out
Leave everything behind
You can live your life anew

What I left behind
Another night
Of weary dreams, unravelling
What's been left behind
Another time
Where days of late are far away

Far away

Dark days behind me
Won't ever break me now

All that I left behind
Another night
Of weary dreams, unravelling
What's been left behind
Another time
Where days of late are far away

Far away

Just another night
In another time
