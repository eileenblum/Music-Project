[Bonus Track]How can we conduct
Symphonies of our destruction
Without having a clue
How to interpret the darkest notes?

There is no need to feel so depraved.
A spotless disease is what I am.
All those fools that I have enslaved
Were so long ago already damned.

There is no need to be so engaged.
The master of the stash is what I am.
All this distress is what I have engraved
Is forming the path that I defend.

Come with me. Acquire the key
To unlock forbidden doors.
Come with me. Be finally free.
The incentive, your decree.

How can we conduct
Symphonies of our destruction
Without having a clue
How to interpret the darkest notes?

There is no need to feel so alone
When your white guide knocks at the door.
Don't you disappoint her, no don't you dare.
She'll destroy you to the quick, to the bone.

Come with me. Acquire the key
To unlock forbidden doors.
Come with me. Be finally free.
The incentive, your decree.

Come with me. Acquire the key
To unlock forbidden doors.
Come with me. Be finally free
The incentive, your decree.

Come with me. On your knees.
The celebration ends.
Come with me. Never flee.
Save me from this.
