[I. Hold In Derision]

Pioneering, big breakthroughs
Proceeded by the opposition
Hold in derision all that's new
Afraid to lose their own esteem

Scorn shall be directed at the genius
Represses subtle theories of the light
To the questions of life

Quantum physics lead us to
Answers to the great taboos
We create the world around us
God is every living soul

Science, spirituality
Will have to meet along the way and
We need new drifts, another view
Expand our grip on the cryptic soul

Scorn shall be directed at the genius.
Represses subtle theories of the light
To the questions of life.

Quantum physics lead us to
Answers to the great taboos.
We create the world around us.
God is every living soul.

Hope is more than a postponed disappointment.

Non intellegens nil explicas.
Videre nolens nil capies.
Non intellegens nil explicas.
Incognita non vides.
[Lacking understanding, you explain nothing.
Unwilling to see, you will grasp nothing.
Lacking understanding, you excplain nothing.
You do not see the unknown.]

Open your Sahasrara

[II. Children Of The Light]

Light creates us all.
Pride will make us fall.
Life is meaningful.
Life delights us all.

Light creates us all.
Pride divides us all.
Life is meaningful.
The soul survives us all.

Misled by science.
Our wake up call.
Conditioning cannot fool us 'till the end.

Light creates us all.
Pride will make us fall.
Life is meaningful.
Life delights us all.

Light creates us all.
Pride divides us all.
Life is meaningful.
The soul survives us all.

[III. Bardo ThÃ¶dol]

Guide us safety through the gates of death

[IV. Paragons Of Perfection]

Nothing here will be the same
I'll see the world through different eyes and
I was given clarity
And the wisdom I can't deny

All that we can ever see
Until we leave this frail existence
Is just a shadow of reality
Death is not the final instance

It's not your time
You have to go back... back!
Now!

No, no, I don't want to return,
Please let me stay here, don't make me go back

Go back, you've got work to do

We're not alone, we are all one.

Nothing here will be the same
The smallest bit is as big as nature
Our limited capacities
Gives us trouble to comprehend

We are linked in every way
And we're strong as our weakest fragment
Every word that we convey
Is an act with consequences

[V. The Harsh Return]

Misled by science.
Our wake up call.
Conditioning cannot
Fool us 'till the end.

Light creates us all.
Pride will make us fall.
Life is meaningful.
Life delights us all.

Light creates us all.
Pride divides us all.
Life is meaningful.
The soul survives us all.

Greed will make us fall.
Light will bind us all.

Greed will make us fall
Light will bind us all
