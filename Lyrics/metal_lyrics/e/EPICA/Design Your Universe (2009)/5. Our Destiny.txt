So many days we've spent together
Trying to get ahead with our dreams
Now we have come to the goal forgotten
Hurting within left us torn

The road is open
We find out way through ties where broken
So the means to the end
Was the peace that was meant
To be ours since it all began

We fight to win

I won't give up, we'll fight to win
To move along from where we'd been
I'll sing this song for you again
I'm looking up around the bend
We're so much stronger than before
Our fraying edges on the mend

Life as we know would be so different
Had our paths continued the same
Seizing the day with all that's offered
The good and the bad,
The clear and the haze.

The road is open.
We find out way through ties where broken.
So the means to the end
Was the peace that was meant
To be ours since it all began.

We fight to win.

I won't give up, we'll fight to win
To move along from where we'd been.
I'll sing this song for you again.
I'm looking up around the bend.
We're so much stronger than before,
Our fraying edges on the mend.

To move along from where we'd been
I'll sing this song for you again
I won't give up, we'll fight to win.
We're so much stronger than before,
Our fraying edges on the mend.

Don't let go.
Don't let go.
Don't let go.

So hard to face what we've done wrong.
We shared a life that can't be.
We cannot hide from destiny.
So hard to face what had gone wrong.
We've got to make this work
And give it our all.

Give our all and won't let go.
Waiting so long for the answer.
We've been waiting oh so very long and
Now we're ready to accept our fate.

I won't give up, we'll fight to win
To move along from where we'd been.
I'll sing this song for you again.
I'm looking up around the bend.
We're so much stronger than before,
Our fraying edges on the mend.

- (I won't give up this fight,)
Our melodies
- (The sacrifices made.)
Will be remembered
- (We gave our all)
Forever and ever.
- (And won't let it go to die in vain)

- (I'll sing this song again.)
Our memories
- (We're stronger than before.)
Will fade away
- (We have the chance of lifetime.)
When the leaves have reached the soil.
- (We'll never close this door.)
