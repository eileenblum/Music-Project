[Instrumental][Malcolm X Speech:]
"No negro leaders have fought for civil rights;
They paid for civil rights.
They have begged the white man for civil rights.
They have begged the white man for freedom,
And any time you beg another man to set you free,
You will never be free.
Freedom is something you have to do for yourselves,
And until the american negro lets the white man know
That we are really, really ready and willing to pay the
Price that is destined for freedom,
Our people will always be walking around as second
Class citizens or what you call twentieth century slaves.
What price are you talking about sir?
The price of freedom is death."
