[Bonus Track][feat. Amanda Somerville]Declining
All color fading.
Defining
Time coming for me.
Rescinding
My inspiration.
Receding consciousness.

Back in the day, I can recall that
My thoughts were unclouded and sage.
There was no black
Staining the walls of my memories.

Now there's a haze pushing me sideways,
And leaving me nothing to gain,
Taking me back,
Locking me cold in disparity.

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream.
Long for the day I can be myself.

When I'm free,
When my sun has set,
Released my soul forever,
I'll have no regret
To be free.
I'll exist again.
No more lost endeavors.
Nothing to contend
When I'm free.

Color declines all that defines me
Is falling away, far behind.
Nothing to keep me with the time,
The here and now.

Where am I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream,
Yearning again only to be myself.

When I'm free,
When my sun has set,
Released my soul forever,
I'll have no regret
To be free.
I'll exist again.
No more lost endeavors.
Nothing to contend
When I'm free.

- (Cure me, free me, help me, see me
- No more worry, no more losing)

Time is just a concept
- (Save me, near me, help me, hear me.)
And always the first thing to fade.
- (No more heartache, no misery.)
Agony and weakness,
- (Cure me, free me, help me, see me.)
Nothing we can never evade.
- (No more worry, no agony.)

Years are cruel, they break us,
- (Save me, near me, help me, hear me.)
Bringing on decay and despair, (we despair)
- (No more heartache, no despairing.)
Awareness and perception.
- (Cure me, free me, help me, see me.)
Something we can never repair. (No repair)
- (No more worry, no repairing.)

Freedom for me is all I'm really wanting, needing.
Give me power to break out,
I can't hold on for any longer.
My time has come to end it all.

No one to blame,
Fate's only random.
It's nothing we'll ever explain.
So it remains.

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself...
(Free...)
When will I be unleashed?
It's not the way it should be,
Yearning again only to be myself.

(Unleash my consciousness!)

When I'm free,
When my sun has set,
Released my soul forever,
I'll have no regret
To be free.
I'll exist again.
No more lost endeavors.
Nothing to contend
When I'm free.
