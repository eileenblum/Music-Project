Can't move an inch
But for the act to
Leave fingerprints.
Freedom farewell!
Look in the lens.
Answer the questions.
Are you a threat?

Nec plus ultra [No further]
After all the grabbing, it's time to bite the dust
Leave behind the breaches of my trust
Cleaning up the mess is up to us

Non plus ultra [No further]
Now that all hands are tied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Demolition, the damaged pride

The price of ambition
Nec plus ultra [No further]

The current system leads to profit seeking deeds
Leave behind the traces of our blood
Now the course for change is up to us
Non plus ultra [No further]

Now that all hands are tied,
We're panic stricken,
Wealth out of sight.
Demolition, the damaged pride,
The price of ambition.

Access is now denied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Intuition, forgotten guide
The price of suppression

Terre eos vi
Augearis
Perde eos vi
Nobis imperium
[Frighten them with might.
May you be exalted.
Destroy them with might.
Power for us.]

Can't move an inch
But for the act to
Leave fingerprints.
Freedom farewell!
Look in the lens.
Answer the questions.
Will you behave as required?
When we think the end is here
With nearly all faith gone.
There is hope along the way
And there are new age dawns.

"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe that they are free."
[Goethe]

Nobis victoria.
Non plus ultra
[Victory for us.
No further.]

Now that all hands are tied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Demolition, the damaged pride
The Price of Ambition

Access is now denied
We're panic stricken
Wealth out of sight
Intuition, forgotten guide
The price of suppression

Can't move an inch
But for the act to
Leave fingerprints.
Freedom farewell!
Look in the lens.
Answer the questions.
Will you behave as required?

When we think the end is here,
With nearly all faith gone,
There is hope along the way
And there a new age dawns.

When we think the end is here
And our faith will disappear!
When we think (when we think)
The end is here (the end is near)
And our faith will disappear!

Chasing our addictions, we're stunting our growth.
Once we get rid of this ballast, we'll be able to
Restore the balance and distribute our wealth.
