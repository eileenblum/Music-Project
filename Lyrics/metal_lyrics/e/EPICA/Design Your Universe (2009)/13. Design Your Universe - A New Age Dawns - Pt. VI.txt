We're blind and eager.
Avarice will set us back to blank.
Those who wager all will have to name a reason.
(If you can't let go,) you will end up empty handed
(If you can't control,) you'll live your life in vain.

Who decides about my time to come?
Who is able to break through the circle of life and doom?

Don't look back.
Keep on track to break the curse.
Take the chance:
Design your universe.

We can't undo what we have done,
So show us now what we've become.
Confront us with our viciousness
And our weakness.
We can't evade our destiny,
So show responsibility,
For we all surely have a sense
Of our consciousness.

To take for taking's sake
Will leave a path of loss and strain,
And endless breaking of faith can warrant acts of treason.
(If you can't let go,) you will end up empty handed
(If you can't control,) you'll live your life in vain

Who decides about what's true or false?
Who is able to sift through the treasures from the flukes?

Don't look back.
Keep on track to break the curse.
Take the chance:
Design your universe.

We can't undo what we have done,
So show us now what we've become.
Confront us with our viciousness
And our weakness.
We can't evade our destiny,
So show responsibility,
For we all surely have a sense
Of our consciousness.

The time has come. We have to see
That total wisdom is in reach.
The time has come to colour in the lines.
We must identify the signs.

So many people are full of hate,
While love and light are in their reach.
So many people will harm themselves,
But life can be so beautiful.

So many people will idolize,
While their own success is in their reach.
Don't forget you're able to
Design your own universe.

Find your balance.
Sink into rumination.

Ipsum te reperies.
Potire mundorum.
Potire omnis mundi.
[You will discover yourself.
Become a master of worlds.
Become a master of the whole world.]

We can't undo what we have done,
So show us now what we've become.
Confront us with our viciousness
And our weakness.
We can't evade our destiny,
So show responsibility,
For we all surely have a sense
Of our consciousness.

Can't undo.
Show us now.
Confront us.
We're the weakness.
Can't evade.
Show us how.
We have our sense.
