I see an angel in the sky
Sheâs reaching out to me
The light around her is divine

I see the ocean in her eyes
Our thoughts will intertwine
In the fullness of our time

Then she takes me by the hand
And whispers in my ear

Walk up the stairway to heaven; weâll wander far beyond the stars
You only have to confide in me and Iâll be yours forevermore

Not knowing if Iâm wide awake or if Iâm vast asleep
To realize whatâs going on
Her presence is taking over me, caught in a reverie
We know our worlds lie far apart

Then she takes me by the hand
And all becomes so clear

Weâll walk up the stairway to heaven; weâll wander far beyond the stars
You only have to confide in me and Iâll be yours forevermore
Weâll walk in the heaven so high above, where we will be in celestial spheres
If youâd only depend on me, I shall be yours forevermore

I SHALL FIGHT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH
TO HUNT YOU DOWN (TO HUNT YOU DOWN)
I SHALL CHEAT WITHOUT REMORSE
IF THATâS THE ONLY WAY

He whispers in my ear

Weâll walk up the stairway to heaven; weâll wander far beyond the stars
You only have to confide in me and Iâll be yours forevermore
Weâll walk in the heaven so high above, where we will be in celestial spheres
If youâd only depend on me, Iâll be yours forevermore

You and me forevermore
