On the way to sacred shores
And in the arms of the life that we adore
Moonlight shows a white design
That's been waiting for a chance to seize a soul once more

Sweet lad, o come and join me, do!
Such pretty games I will play with you

On a road
Changing course

Lightning strikes where we depart
An eerie voice as the night embrace the heart
Resonating from the life that is moving on
To new windows of the soul

Will you, sweet lad, come along with me?
My daughters shall care for you tenderly

Hear his mystic voice

I love you, your comeliness charms me, my boy!
And if you're not willing, my force I'll employ

He feeds on stainless souls

We are stuck in the night
Ancient power will strike
Feel the fire
Now run into his arms
Leave your shelter behind
We are going to fly

Higher than high
We will take on the sky
Feel my senses
United by the night

Now it's time to close the door
And open up like before
New windows of the soul

The silence of the void
A father's life destroyed

Stuck in the night
Ancient power will strike
Feel the fire
Burn inside
Run into my arms
Leave your shelter behind
We're going to fly
See us fly
And hear our cry
We're out of sight
Higher than high we will
Take on the sky
Feel my senses
Out of my sight
But live on in my mind
New windows of our soul
