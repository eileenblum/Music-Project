[Previously Unreleased Orchestral Version]

Searching for what she can't find
For her own peace of mind

She can't forgive, nor forget the past
These ineffable feelings and hurt that last evermore

Bewail the truth, the face of fate, and conquer all the past

Don't enthrall yourself, let the penance begin
You've got to open your heart to see the confinement

Bewail the truth, the face of fate, and conquer all the past [2x]

It seems so futile, forgiveness, your freedom
The present state of veniality

Bewail the truth, the face of fate, and conquer all the past [3x]
Search for the light, and then you'll find your own peace of mind

Thanks to maybeth for sending track #4 lyrics
