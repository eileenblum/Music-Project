[Bonus Track]

[Originally By Fear Factory]

There is no love!
No love!

I am a duplication
Innocently
I was conceived
So violently
There was no love
There was no love for me
There was only hatred

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

Every day I feel anonymous hate
Forever in the shadow of disgrace

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

I am so filled with pain
A bruised and darknened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

I don't want to live that
Way!
I don't want to live that
Way!

There is no love!

Every day I feel anonymous hate
Forever in the shadow of disgrace

I am rape
I am hate
I am rape
I am hate

I am so filled with pain
A bruised and darknened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

I am so filled with pain
A bruised and darknened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

I don't want to live that
Way!
[X3]

I am so filled with pain
A bruised and darknened soul
Spare me from the
Life that's full of misery

Spare me from the
Life that's full of pain
Spare me from the
Life that's full of pain

I don't want to live that
Way!
[X6]
