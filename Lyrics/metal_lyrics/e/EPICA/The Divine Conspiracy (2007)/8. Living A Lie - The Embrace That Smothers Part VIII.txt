Don't believe what you see
Believe in me
In my reality
I am a man of God

God, can't you hear that I'm begging you?

Don't believe what you hear
Believe in me
And I will reappear
Salvation here at last

At last someone to answers all my prayers

Hope is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts
But pray for life
Find salvations in distress
We will wait
For the day you'll break out and
Re-awake

Lies

Don't believe what you see
Believe in me
And my reality
Eternity indeed

Indeed i'ts the end all and be all there's

Hope is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts
But pray for life
Find salvations in distress
We will wait
For the day you'll break out and
Re-awake

Lies

Domine lesu, demitte nobis debita nostra,
salva nos ab igne inferiori,
perduc in caelum omnes animas
praesertim eas, quae misericordiae tuae
maxime indigent.

In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen

Living a lie

Human power
Will devour
Our senses
Bring us to forget
Human sources will not save
The power of faith
Heals us all

Hope is a desert running dry
Deep inside
You refuse to face the facts
But pray for life
Find salvations in distress
We will wait
For the day you'll break out and
Re-awake
And we wait for the day
To discover there's no way
I can't wait at this rate
It's too little and too late
To live this lie

Living a lie
