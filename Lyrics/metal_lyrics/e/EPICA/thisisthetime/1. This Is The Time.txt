This is the time
We've waited too long
And I'm wondering where I belong?
We have lost
We're out of control
When we fail nature speaks to us all

This is the time
I'll tell you why the world's left alone
Now's the time to make right what's wrong
We have lost
We're out of control
If we're stray can we hear nature's call?
When we fail nature speaks to us all

This is the time
So what's the world to be?
Just a luxury?
A temporary scene?
But what have we got when it's gone away?
And we need to come to see
What the earth should be
A sanctuary free
A renewed paradise is still alive

This is the time
The sky and the sea
We speak the paragons
We planted the seed
We have lost
We're out of control
If we're stray can we hear nature's call?
When we fail nature speaks to us all

This is the time
So what's the world to be?
Just a luxury?
A temporary scene?
But what have we got when it's gone away?
And we need to come to see what the earth should be
A sanctuary free
All that we've sacrificed in the end has its price
A renewed paradise's still alive in our eyes

This is the time
So what's the world to be?
Just a luxury?
A temporary scene?
But what have we got when it's gone away?
And we need to come to see what the earth should be
A sanctuary free
All that we've sacrificed in the end has its price
A renewed paradise's still alive in our eyes

It's still alive in our eyes
