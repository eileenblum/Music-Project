[Choral:]
Declining, all color fading
Defining, time coming for me
Rescinding, my inspiration
Receding consciousness
Set me free!

[Amanda:]
Back in the day, I can recall that
My thoughts were unclouded and sage
There was no black staining the walls of my memories
[Simone:]
Now there's a haze pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back, locking me cold in disparity

[Amanda:]
Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

[Simone:]
Color declines, all that defines me
Is falling away, far behind
Nothing to keep me with the time,the here and now

[Amanda:]
Where am I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Yearning again only to be myself

[Simone:]
When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
[Amanda:]
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

[Choral:]
Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no more losing
Save me, near me, help me, hear me
No more heartache, no misery
Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no agony.
Save me, near me, help me, hear me
No more heartache, no despairing (We despair)
Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no repairing (No repair)

[Simone:]
Time is just a concept
And always the first thing to fade
Agony and weakness
Nothing we can ever evade
Years are cruel, they break us
Bringing on decay and despair
Awareness and perception
Something we can never repair

[Choral:]
Freedom for me is all I'm really wanting, needing
Give me power to break out
I can't hold on for any longer
My time has come to end it all

[Amanda:]
No one to blame, fate's only random
It's nothing we'll ever explain
So it remains

[Simone:]
Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

-Free-

[Amanda:]
When will I be unleashed?
It's not the way it should be
Yearning again only to be myself
When I'm free

[Choral:]
Unleash my consciousness

[Simone:]
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free
