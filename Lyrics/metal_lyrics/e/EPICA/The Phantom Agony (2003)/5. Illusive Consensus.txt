So sweet caress, never long to last!
You entered my soul and gave hope to my life.

So sweet caress, never hope to last!
You left me behind all alone and aghast
Captured inside such an austere Elysium

Imperfect feelings, futile grief
Love a device against all solitude
As it all went on, the love became
A field in a dream that once had been real

So sweet caress, never long to last!
Destroy this illusion we need a change of fate!
Your frantic thoughts are only a condemned cry

Primo somniare videbamur deinde veritas se praecipitavit

I secretly longed for something which had never existed

First I thought it was a dream but then it smashed into reality
Beautiful on the outside, decayed deeply within

I secretly longed for something which had never existed

Devoted to a body without a soul

Numquam non tibi diffidam
