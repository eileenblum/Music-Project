Somnia cum clamoribus
Linquite corda plena ravoris
Videte pompam horroris
Paries scaenae perditorum

Within the corners of a waking mind
(Awaiting the count)
Distant dreams are not too far behind
It is the architect of light
(That's shown in the night)
A passage through a sleeping mind's myriad dreams

Somnia cum clamoribus
Linquite corda plena ravoris
Videte pompam horroris
Paries scaenae damnatorum

Forever guided by the great design
(In moonrise we drown)
Crystal circles will create a sign
Tangled streams of endless energy
(Unseen enemies)
A mosaic of insanity a million fears

Approximate the minds debate
In the night your eyes are blind
The wicked beasts are well disguised
My inner wounds will never heal
The dark of night has now arrived
Within the corners of my life
Lift up the shadows of the heart
Prepare for what your eyes will see

What we cannot see
We should not believe
What lies beneath the gravity
We all see the architect of light
That pulls you down
What we cannot hear
We no longer fear
Nothing is ever what it seems
We all see the architect of light
That pulls you down

As now devotion will unfold
Take in the fear of truth untold
And now the diamonds are aligned
We'll wear jewels of the night

Approximate the minds debate
In the night your eyes are blind
The wicked beasts are well disguised
My inner wounds will never heal
The dark of night has now arrived
Within the corners of my life
Lift up the shadows of the heart
Prepare for what your eyes will see

What we cannot see
We should not believe
What lies beneath the gravity
We all see the architect of light
That pulls you down
What we cannot hear
We no longer fear
Nothing is ever what it seems
We all see the architect of light

What we cannot see
We should not believe
What lies beneath the gravity
We all see the architect of light
It pulls you down
What we cannot hear
We no longer fear
Nothing is ever what it seems
We all see the architect of light
That pulls you down
