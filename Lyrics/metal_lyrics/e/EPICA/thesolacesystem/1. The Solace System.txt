Razor lights on the path of progress
To gain new insight
Lose control, give in to your senses
To reach brand new heights

When a grandeour of scenes arrives with the night
Revealing the author of fear
The reason why all of my virtues are shut down and hollow

If the light that sinks in is changing all shapes
And magic is brought down to it's knees
Will not be the one
To lose it all over again

We will take you to the mire
We will show you shattered rhymes

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world
With true transparent eyes

Razor lights on the path of progress
To gain new insight

If you trying to see when all lights are have gone
A silhouette without a face
Imprinting a vision that opens my eyes to creation

It's identity will reflect what I see
Control is the way to prevail
And lift up the shadows that keep me from reaching the bay

Shadows bring the night to life
Anguish harbors depth of fright

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world
With true transparent eyes

All that is real
You alone welcome the other side

Far from the distant shores
Lies another paradise unlighted
Unlock the hidden heart inside
See the wonder of my world
With true transparence

Deep within forlorn stream
Lies the wonder of my world
In a true transparent dream

I make progress
I walk
The path of self-mastery
Let go of all agony
