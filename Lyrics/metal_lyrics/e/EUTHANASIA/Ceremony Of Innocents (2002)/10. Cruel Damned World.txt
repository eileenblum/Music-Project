You may hope to see wake up the sun.
Joy and happiness, strangers to your minds.
Your only certitude in this damned world is
The innocence is lost.

The songs of your fatherlands, undesired pride.
Tons of live arms are the flags of fire.
You lost all brothers, so suddenly.
This cruel damned world we still cherish.

Just silent memory sounds in my head.
So many ways to destroy mankind.
We have chosen the shortest way ever known,
Do I hear the song of freedom?
