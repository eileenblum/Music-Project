In an empty house, where I had seen your face
Eternal silence came you disappeared without trace.
Behind the empty house smell of arms like a witness.

One cruelty is over, hatred breed fear
Maybe you disappeared.
If loving means losing, then love in the afterlife.

Light and dark, we always fumble at the bottom of conscience.
Slave and time, all stories of horror go repeating...of violence.

Light and dark, why do I keep the seeing wraith of your soul.
Slave and time, all stories of horror go repeating...of violence.

Stay alive, another sunset. No time to cry, I must tell you.
Oh, how I would die for you. Stay alive, another dawn.
In the meadow full of flowers and scared with crosses.
Please, wait for me!
