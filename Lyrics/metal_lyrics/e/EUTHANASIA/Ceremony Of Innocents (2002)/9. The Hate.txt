We want to be honest and satisfied till the end of our days.
Millions eyes so often are blind it's agony of mankind.
The hate is born, the hate arose from perfidious love.
The wicked people rule over this world and children's cry
In the anthem of mankind.

We know the prophecy of our ancestors of the truth,
Turning into the light.
He, who promises true love and peace, then sells the war and fear.
The hate is born, the hate arose from perfidious love.
We live together in poverty and wealth,
We destroy hearts, loving their own lives.
