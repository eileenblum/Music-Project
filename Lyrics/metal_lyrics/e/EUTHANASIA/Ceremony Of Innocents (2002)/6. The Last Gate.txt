My life, I loved you so, but can't dream about
A never-ending, sacred night.

Honesty was not my oath in the fields of love I heard
The weeping of her glowing eyes.

My time has come and I pray for all my life sins.
Maybe I will confess to god but without tears.
I'm daze by the light of the eternal way
Behind the gate of times.
Echoes of calls pray for my return,
Calls of known voices.

But she didn't stay with me behind the gate.
I know she didn't stay with me, my only love.
