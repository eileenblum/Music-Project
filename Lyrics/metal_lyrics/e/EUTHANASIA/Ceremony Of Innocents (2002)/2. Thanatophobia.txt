The sun means day and night for us is resurrection.
Wings of years don't save our weakness
The bells of churches our joy, our care.

The room is darkened I can't hear the voice.
The dream is alive and I see you all of us again.

I crossed the dark and I see the past, here am I?
Maybe I'll breathe maybe I'll stay with you or
Beyond the gate?

We're smiling and crying, your name sounds in our ears.
I don't believe, I'm on the way between the death and eternity

And I'd like to wake in your kingdom on one day.
We're just puppets you haven't changes us, we're
Afraid in your arms.
