The members of NIM (National Identity Movement),
friends, brothers and sisters to Kathrin.
Under the mask of understanding, they sway in their hands
the tools of annihilation
the planned violence is changing the vision of revolution
The reality of these days is spinning roulette wheel
Removing Erin takes its toll

The idea of a struggle for their own conviction
Fails in attempts to declare the ideal
The message engulfed in the joy of emotional motives
Turns into the hunt for the renegade
It's hard leave under the threat of uncompromising attack

Every time she turns round the corner
She is afraid they will be there.
I don't wanna be there when they break through her door
Every day now is the day of the rope.
