I promise, as I see you crawling on the ground -
Everything will come to be.
Everyone can see behind the screen
a reflection of heavenly light, but....

We lost our faith
We became lost in the future
Nothing lasts forever.
Where there are damned skies and oceans,
There is time for the pain...and for eternal abandonment.

This human race has overstepped its condition
A deformation of souls and thoughts.
We're dragging a bloody flag, colored
by the night and the reddest tears.

We lost our face
We lost our identity
Standing on the threshold of a new evolution
Which will be for us the final destination.

I do not believe anyone remembers
What exists around us.
We close our eyes and we know why
We fight for money and the children cry.

We lost our pain,
We lost our judgement.
Nothing lasts forever.
Whoever wants to stare at empty hearts
Can lift up his eyes....and thousands of phrases echo from faraway

Who cannot cross over must find his end...
That is what we chose, there can be nothing else.
