In the gardens of deafening amazing
I have fulfilled my destiny
beyond human understanding of life
When unspoken wishes found freedom
And the desire to awaken frozen time
And open the gate to illusion

In a solitude and understanding of human vanity
I walk through the landscape of forgetfulness.
Foggy curtains hide misunderstanding.
Not everyone can see the unwritten words
Of our destinies,
As we search for the path to sensuality

Permanently trying to leave our trace
We bring nothing into this world
And a simple life offers only a little
Of what we can carry inside of us.
In the gardens of discovered silence
I have fulfilled my destiny.
