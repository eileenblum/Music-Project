I'm takin' a look, one was all it took to center my attention.
Need to know your name, need to feel the stain of your lips break this tension.
I reach out to touch the soul of tonight.
My eyes (I've lost my head) have finally seen the light (where have I been?).
I'll rest where love can't find me (these tired eyes), to complicate my life (are wearing thin).
My eyes (it's in my skin) have finally seen the light (where have I been?).
Reflecting all the suffering (I lost my head), I now can leave behind (and I'm giving in).
This mirror reflects all that I project.
No amount of truth can take this back.
Too many lines, and these tired eyes have seen enough tragedy tonight.
I reach out to touch the soul of tonight.
And we crush our dreams away, gripping tightly as they fade, falling into this design.
