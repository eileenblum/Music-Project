As we sit down to this lovely gourmet meal, the candle light is shining off your face.
I gaze into your beautiful eyes, you give me this hideous look, a look that's meant to kill.
Coming from a face so dull, open up your eyes and see what you have missed.
I thought this night would be so perfect, if only you'd give a damn.
Did you really think that I did not know how to save you from choking on your own tongue?
This is what I call revenge, held in for so long.
Now you're swallowing my pain instead of your desert.
Each slice you cut, to filet cuts into me.
Bite hard, chew fast, I hope you choke, on more then just your ignorance.
Cough up my love, given a dish that's best served cold.
I never regret the days that I see you, I just regret that day that I met you.
