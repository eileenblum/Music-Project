I never knew the day we met would be the day I died from this overwhelming need that burns inside.
Tragically, I had the world within my sights.
Little did I know, this was all in my mind.
Where did you go?
Where have you been?
What kind of world am I living in?
Please pull me from this hell I live.
I'm burning up, and you're over this.
In every pill I take, each night I lie awake, your face is all I fucking see.
Face buried in a pillow, all I see is the silhouette of you dancing in my dreams.
Just pull the plug and end what you've begun.
This love is hell, my heart is dead.
