You push my buttons and open these scars, just to watch me bleed what I've already bled a thousand times before.
Agonizing, you make me scream and shout.
I always look to you, you're the reason that I'm always coming down.
Always coming down.
I'm just a bruised and broken heart, but the memories you left are of a girl who's lost and broken.
Now it's a shame you've lost your touch, and you can't control your lust.
I was only a heartbeat away from forgiving you.
Let the past be.
I'm learning lessons, while you're still breaking hearts.
If you could see the world is not as cold as you had thought before.
Always trying to break and keep me down.
You're the reason that I turned my life around.
You were everything I'd ever need (but we are through).
And I'm everything you'll never be (I'll see this through).
And now I'm giving you all that you've earned.
How's it feel to see the tables turned? You will never see this face again.
I have no more tears to be shed.
You will not see this face again.
