The water's overflowing and carrying away the picture on the edge of the tub.
I held it close to me, to try and keep up hopes that you would see I have no more air to breathe, and I'm hoping for you to come and save me.
One more time, that I find myself drowning in thoughts of you.
Holding my fleeting one last breath, praying that this hole in my chest will heal.
I'll find another way for me to fight my pain.
The water seeps into my lungs, I tell myself I'll try to emerge from my prison I have built from loneliness.
But, I'm failing at my attempts to leave.
You're reaching your hand out.
I can't believe it's true.
My prayers have been answered and I know that only you can breathe life into me.
Completely resuscitate, and help me to escape, and take it all away.
