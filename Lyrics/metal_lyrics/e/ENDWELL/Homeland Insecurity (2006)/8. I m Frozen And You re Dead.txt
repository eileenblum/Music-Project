She stands so picturesque, heart beating through my chest and my mind cannot take what she is setting off in me.
A feeling so unique I'm crippled by its ecstasy.
Feel free to take it away.
Feel free to take this all from me.
Strap on your wings and fly away.
Fly away (from me), fly away (from me), when life leads you astray, and there are no more games to play.
Just fly away.
As this tale unfolds, the story's growing old.
Once again I'm sleeping all alone.
And through this pain I've grown.
My head is still your home.
Nothing is the way it used to be.
Strap on your wings and fly away.
Now I'm breaking down your heart of stone, waiting for the winds to change to bring you back, back to me.
Everyone can see, you're not the girl you used to be, so, steal another's soul.
I'm breaking down your heart of stone, taking you off your throne.
I'm frozen and you're dead.
