I twist and turn in bed as you spiral through my head.
I won't continue to let these games be played.
I never wanted, never wanted any of this.
In here I feel so out of place.
She kills me with a single gaze (she ends me).
Infatuations turn to needs (don't need this anymore).
I stumbled into her embrace.
All this time, you've tried to make a new excuse to justify why not to hate you.
Stumbling through fate, games are played again.
I should take control and put you to an end.
These years have come and went, so many things I now regret.
For me there is no saving grace.
My heart is not equipped for this torment.
