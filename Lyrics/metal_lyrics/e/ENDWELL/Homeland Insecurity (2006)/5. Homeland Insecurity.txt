Light speed ahead and I can't see us turning this ship around.
Born and bred to live this dream we've started, started breaking down.
This is something that we never thought we'd see.
We are finally where we want to be.
With all the rapid progress, we can't forget our promise.
I was ready to give up on all of this.
All my insecurities are turning this to tragedy.
Now all my doubts and fears are somehow getting the best of me.
All these complex feelings, once again my worst enemy.
With all this daily nonsense, I can't forget this promise.
We hold this close to our hearts.
A promise I made to keep.
I won't let this dream fade.
Always searching for what's next.
Never looking where we stand.
