Can you feel it coming? Nothing as it seems.
Everything so perfectly wrong, so intoxicating like the fury of the seas.
Let it crash just like the waters to my feet.
I've traded memories for wings, and I'm ready to get high.
No more chains around my feet, liberated, I take to the sky.
As this dose begins to peak I'm free.
You, you have a certain way of imposing ideals on me.
But, I've no more demons to slay, no more unwelcome company.
There are no more chains restraining me from where I want to be.
I've traded memories for wings and I'm free from all your games.
You underestimated me.
I'm stronger than you'll ever be.
I hate the way that you impose yourself on me.
The weight upon my shoulders could have turned coal to diamonds, but I set my demons free.
I let them reign.
