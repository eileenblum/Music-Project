Consequences...
Whatever happened to second chances?
Ow I'm standing here empty handed.
Nothing turned out just like the way I planned it.
I brought this down on to myself, burning every bridge on my way out.
The roads ahead are paved with fear and doubt, but there's a glimmer of hope; that happiness can be found
