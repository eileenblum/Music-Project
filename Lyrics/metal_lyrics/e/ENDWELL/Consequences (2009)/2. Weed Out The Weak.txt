Most who were facing me have turned around.
There's not a day that I don't think about the choices made that lead us to this place, but you chose to take the easy way out, with no support when we needed you most.
Cut my losses cut you the fuck out.
I'm so fucking sick of Judas friends and sell out jokes.
You're the reason that I'm living void of faith and hope.
Just give it up pack it in the fucking hype is dead.
The hear you never had will bring you down in the end.
Weed out the weak.
Who had a choice to make.
True colors shining through
