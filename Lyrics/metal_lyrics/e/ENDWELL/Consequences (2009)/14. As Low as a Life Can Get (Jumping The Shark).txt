You know I never had a bone to pick with you
Get fucked, goodbye.
You let your insecurities shine through your broken ties.
So honestly just tell me what I did.
To make you turn
your back on me time and time again.
I'm not wishing you the best,
and this is not the end.
She told me every word,
Everything you said and every fear you had
all the jealousy and bitterness.
This issue of respect
and how you came too quick.
You say this wont 'endwell',
but I promise you that this will never end.
You're out of place.
You're talk is cheap.
No message to convey.
No virtue or integrity.
you ran your mouth I stood in place.
You live your life in such bad taste.
Holding onto every grudge and every ounce of pain
you think that you're on top but this whole thing is crumbling.
The negativity you spit may help you through the day,
but when all is said and done and you look back you will regret the role you play.
Are you content with your legacy?
Longing for better company
you're hearts no good
are you content with your misery?
You're crying for sympathy you feel rejected?
and all you wanted was to be friends,
but your actions were unbecoming as can be.
Your worst intentions.
Wishing the world to fall on me.
I've had enough... you're act is up.
Wishing the world to fall on me
We've had enough... your act is up.
Bottom line
You're an awful fucking human being.
What's done is done
you will never get the best of me.
Nothing you say could effect or inspire me.
Your worst intentions.
There, will be consequences.
You're free to speak...
But nothings free
maybe your bleeding wrists
will bring us both some peace.
Karma has not come yet
