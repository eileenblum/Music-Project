Throes of fear and apathy.
Stale air that I cannot breath.
Melancholy empty dreams
where days of woe meet nights of grief.
Broken heart
dying light fades away.
Broken hope
striving for what you can't be,
and every move I never made;
and I'm looking for pieces.
Pieces I left in you.
Pieces of me in you.
Start over.
Fuck all the flashing lights
That blind us.
Fuck every sleepless night.
It's only us left in this fight.
Inspired through trails,
I'm giving up this time.
Our light will never shine.
All bets are off,
and day by day
I will refrain from regression
and concerning you,
with everything I said,
I'd never say and ill never say
the words that mean the most to you.
Sometimes happiness is just not an option.
what's done is done let this go
