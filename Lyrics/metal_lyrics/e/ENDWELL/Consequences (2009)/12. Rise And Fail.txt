This sorrow somehow conforts me.
Solace is found within defeat.
Once a boy with dreams I held so high,
but those dreams will never see the light of day.
Life takes away.
No answers.
No sympathy.
I've called on every fucking deity and none of them will answer me.
I try to question all my suffering
Must be the price I pay for existing.
Extinguish me.
Give up on me.
Life takes away
