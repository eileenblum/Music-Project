COLD SWEATS and VERTIGO/I'm back in hell again
I've been expecting this/the cycle never ends
waiting for signs again/waiting to lift this curse
eyes to the sky again/waiting for NO RESPONSE
this place is starting to resemble a tomb
I hear the dirt dance above
must be in over our heads
maybe its time to give up?
sometimes it doesn't add up
sometimes you know when to stop
sometimes the grief is too much
and when push comes to shove
sometimes the shove ain't enough
waiting for signs again/waiting to lift this curse
eyes to the sky again/waiting for NO RESPONSE
every step is in the shadow of death
as the change begins to take it's effect
the life you've led has brought you to this
sometimes your hard on your luck/the world just cant give a fuck
it overwhelms/and overstays its welcome here
it comes in waves/until they carry me away
all the way BACK HOME/if I had my way
so this is living life?/Im not waiting to die
cant go back/cant go back
I just keep telling myself
its not so bad/so bad to be like everyone else
Its not so hard to fake your life
Ive been living like a ghost
so kiss fucking ground
you can't escape the sound

of all you've built falling down
too far to turn back around
too far to turn this around
I keep my eyes to the ground
I'm gracefully bowing OUT
this all has to end and I'm sickened by the thought of it
there's no common sense &amp; the crime doesn't fit the punishment
if I can't exact my revenge I'll face the consequence and come down again
waiting for signs again/waiting to lift this curse
eyes to the sky again/waiting for NO RESPONSE
waiting for NO RESPONSE...waiting for NO RESPONSE
waiting for NO RESPONSE...waiting for NOTHING
