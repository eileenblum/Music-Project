No more ghosts
No more living life in limbo
No more ghosts
No more home
you will never know just what it's like to watch your life get up and walk away
with nothing you can do this time can't be replaced maybe another day
maybe another life you'll find another way/ ashes are all that you'll leave behind
live each day like its your last and keep the pain inside
so you outlived your dreams? all your passions have died?
this my friend is not the end in time you'll come to find
that life goes on but life's not long just move along
keep moving on
Moving On
trampled by the world
time and time again
Moving On
Til I Die
All your dreams have passed away
and your faith in life is lost
take the pieces of your life
burn them all
move along
