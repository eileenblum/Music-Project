Cut away/because nothing stays
but the ghosts that just won't seem to leave
stay awake for 3 days straight/or spend a week beneath my sheets
I've compromised my state of being
for this UNCOMPROMISING WEIGHT
I'm building burdens/faith deserted
I don't know how I ended up this way
but the damage is here to stay
how much longer can I keep PUSHING LIFE away?
another month?/another day?
the longer I keep doing this the more I'll have to pay
another stab?/another swing?
the world is throwing punches and I can't keep up the pace
another tour?/another state?
another fucking year without a penny to my name
give it up?/push it away?
ive always been a fan of change
but never when that change involves me
I'm not a righteous one/no I'm not a spoiled son
I gave it all of my guts/but I guess that all just ain't enough
I mourn stability/I'm sick of singing over a dead beat
the high life is coming down/and I got nothing left to say
that you would understand anyway
I'M ON MY OWN
even if I throw this away/the memory will always haunt me
of the days when the sun was shining
so fucking bright that it's light was blinding
now the sun wont rise again/now the sun wont rise my friend
NOW THE SUN WON'T TOUCH MY FACE
I've accepted my fate/I'm DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE
