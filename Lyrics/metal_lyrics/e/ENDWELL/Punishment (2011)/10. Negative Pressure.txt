Always the same/bad luck for me
my plans are shot/my hopes erased
I know I've fucked this up/and I cant just turn the page
bitterness that wont let up/every thought is fueled by rage
COLD WINDS CAST DOWN UPON ME
for months and months/torment my thoughts
I've played the fool/I've played the king
a throne of guilt/kingdom of shame
now I think I know exactly how you felt/when you made your last cry for help
when everything was caving in/and you were so close to the end
COLD WINDS CAST DOWN UPON ME
for months and months/torment my thoughts
so where did the time go?/these days have got me so low
the lights off in the distance resemble armageddon
and the fires would be welcomed/every single burning ember
let it burn/end it all
I've played the fool for too long
