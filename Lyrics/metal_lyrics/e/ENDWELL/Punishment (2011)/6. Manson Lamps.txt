Change is coming/change is coming now
this world has forced you down/time is running
time is running out/signs are all around
life has shut you out/beat you to the ground
been looked down upon/hope has led you on
lifted your spirits just enough to break them down
ALL VULTURES...you'll burn in HELL
snakes and thieves with horns and scales
all vultures burning
passive dreams lead to discontent
you're blindly led by ignorance
all the malice burning in your eyes
from failed attempts at living life
YOU'VE FAILED AGAIN/you don't deserve this life
you're failing/ALL VULTURES...you'll burn in HELL
all the power you could have held
all the love that you could have felt
all the people you pushed to the side
all for nothing/you've wasted your life
WASTED/your life...
you're wasted
