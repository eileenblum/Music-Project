I'm waiting for your call, keep waiting till you fall 
As the night turns to day
I've waited here so long, it's almost time I'm gone 
As my tears meet day 

Dream the night away 
You know I would have everything, if this all wasn't fake 
Sleep our love away
I've never asked for anything 
Sleep on, I'll be gone
Before you're awake 

I'm waiting for your touch, keep waiting for too much 
As my fears, all await 
I've waited here so long, it's funny how you've thrown 
All these years away 

Dream the night away 
You know I would have everything, if this all wasn't fake 
Sleep our love away
I've never asked for anything 
Sleep on, I'll be gone
Before you're awake 

Dream the night away 
You know I would have everything, if this all wasn't fake 
Sleep our love away
I wonât blame you for anything 
Sleep on, I'll be gone
Before you're awake
