Once upon a time, in a land far away 
Where the fairytale lied, you would have it your way 
I would always have wished, as I stood in the mist
To undo the spell I was under 

Years went by and the story goes on 
I'm here wondering why I did everything wrong 
Always hoping that I find the wings and do fly 
And be no more the prey but the hunter 

All seems like the perfect ending 
Still I'm close to understanding 

I still breathe 
But you're killing me, I believe 
That I need a reason to live
I can no longer hide in my dreams 
Gotta still breathe 

Tables have turned, as I'm drifting away
Now the lesson is learned I can no longer stay 
I am finally freed from your hurting and greed 
I see oceans of joy and laughter 

Turning my head for the very last time
In a distance you stand as I leave you behind 
As our fairytale ends, hear my very last words
That I'll happily live ever after 

All seems like the perfect ending 
Still I'm close to understanding 

I still breathe 
But you're killing me, I believe 
That I need a reason to live
I can no longer hide in my dreams 
Gotta still breathe 

No more fairytale, I'm tired of it 
I am no longer brave to fight for all this 
No more fairytale, I'm tired of it 
I am no longer brave to fight for all we've had

I still breathe 
But you're killing me, I believe 
That I need a reason to live
I can no longer hide in my dreams 
Gotta still breathe
