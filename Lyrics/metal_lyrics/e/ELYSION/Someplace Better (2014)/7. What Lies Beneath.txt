Whenever the rain comes down
It carries memories of a prime long gone 
When we used to seize the day 
And drain the nights from all the great Unknown 

Weâre running away 
From colours to grey 
Breakin' out 

To the past I call, wish we never let it go 
We couldn't see at all, it was heaven in disguise 
To the past I turn, when you used to hold my hand 
We could not understand 
What beneath lies 

Inside the diary entries breathe again 
The old days come alive 
Then fading away before 
I even get to wave my dreams goodbye 

Tears running away 
From eyes betrayed 
Dryin' out 

To the past I call, wish we never let it go 
We couldn't see at all, it was heaven in disguise 
To the past I turn, when you used to hold my hand 
We could not understand 
What beneath lies 

To the past I call, wish we never let it go 
We couldn't see at all, it was heaven in disguise 
To the past I turn, when you used to hold my hand 
We could not understand what beneath the future lies 
To the past I call, wish we never let it go 
We couldn't see at all, it was heaven in disguise 
To the past I turn, when you used to hold my hand 
We could not understand 
What beneath lies
