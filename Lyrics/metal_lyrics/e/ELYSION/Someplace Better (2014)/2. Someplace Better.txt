Deep inside, day by day 
There's no wind to blow your sins away 
After all could you be wrong? 
When your heart is broken walkin' alone 
Walkin' alone 

You're sayin', I'm sayin' 
Memories won't last for ever 
You're strayin', I'm strayin' 
Won't you take me someplace better? 

It's all there, everywhere 
In your time of need there's nothing to bear 
There's a light that you can find 
When you're gone see all got left behind 
Left behind 

You're sayin', I'm sayin' 
Memories won't last for ever 
You're strayin', I'm strayin' 
Won't you take me someplace better? 

You're sayin', I'm sayin' 
Agony is not your prayer
You're strayin', I'm strayin' 
Won't you take me someplace better? 

Another day
Just goes on by 
Don't drift away
