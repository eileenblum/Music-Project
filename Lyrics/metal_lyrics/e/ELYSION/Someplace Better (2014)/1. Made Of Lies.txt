What if I wanted to stay away?
What if I wanted to run and hide?
Vows and promises break, oh, hey no
It always ends like this

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles 
And love to dust

Deep in my heart I've been prayin', cravin' for
Someone like you to come and stay
Innocence died in my childhood
I would trust you, but I'm afraid

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles 
And love to dust

Can you heal this human nature wound?
Can you feel for all eternity?
Can you speak for once what is the truth?
Can we rise from our identity?

Lies is what we are made of...

Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dreams to crumbles 
And love to dust
