Here I'm sitting 
One step too far 
For you I'm reaching, my falling star 

So out of words 
So full of wounds 
I wander here, among my ruins 

Is this what we fear, what we have become? 
Is this what we are? 

Come take me back, carry me home 
Unbreak my heart, conscience is gone 
Come end the rain, for all I know 
Among the teardrops I can't reach 
Can't see your transparent love 

Here I'm sitting 
One step too far 
For you I'm reaching, my falling star
