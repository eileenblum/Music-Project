Here I've reached that point again 
I search, but I can't find you 
This tension I can't bear 
I have to dare to fight you 

I run - you hide behind this wall
I'll break your pride, I'll make you fall 

Don't wither inside, stop running away 
Your mirror will fail, you're losing the game 
Don't try to hide, don't try to fade
It's not the same, cause I'm changing
