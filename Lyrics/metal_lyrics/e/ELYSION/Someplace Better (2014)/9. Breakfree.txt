Lead on your crucifying me 
Dream of your great escape 
Keep on electrifying me 
Fire on and break away 

Plan on your sacrificing me 
Scan on the breathes I take 
Keep on electrifying me 
Fire on and break away 

â There's no waking up from you â 

Forever, drift away with me 
Surrender to the heartbeat 
This murder lingers over me 
Could you ever kill to break free? 

Fear on my dominating Thee 
Clear on your mind and pray 
Hear on your inner hating me 
Fight on and run away 

â There's no waking up from you â 

Forever, drift away with me 
Surrender to the heartbeat 
This murder lingers over me 
Could you ever kill to break free? 

More than a thrill, more than unreal 
More than a dream you are inside me 
More than I dare, more than I share 
More than I bear it's you who trapped me

Forever, drift away with me 
Surrender to the heartbeat 
This murder lingers over me 
Could you ever kill to break free?
