Take me
Carry me in your lair and break me 
Feed me your despair 
Many times I've bought every lie you sold 
Will this get me killed? 
Kill me if you will 

I gave you my all 
I dare you to fall 
To slide down to hell, you see me yell 
Can you hear my call? 

Make me pay in tears, but don't forsake me 
I've been dead for years 
Many lives I've seen pass before my screen 
Will this get me killed? 
Kill me if you will 

I gave you my all 
I dare you to fall 
To slide down to hell, you see me yell 
Can you hear my call?
