For heaven you're craving, of which you're deprived 
The lust that you're having is never satisfied 
A moment of weakness, that's when you appeared 
The cruelty I've witnessed is no more present here 

No more lying
Self denying 
You've sealed your fate 

No coming back to you 
All the tears I've cried get your coming back to me denied 
A million lies you've put me through 
Now the spark has died 
There's no coming back to you, no coming back to us 

I'm shutting all windows and sealing the doors 
I did let you come close, but I'll be never yours 
I'll shiver in fear, for memories to fade
I've wished you were here, but now it's just too late 

No more lying
Self denying 
You've sealed your fate 

No coming back to you 
All the tears I've cried get your coming back to me denied 
A million lies you've put me through 
Now the spark has died 
There's no coming back to you, no coming back to us 

For long I have waited for tears to dry out 
Now everything in my head cries out our chance is long gone 
No matter how badly I've wished otherwise 
Everything whispers that you have sadly sealed our fate 

No coming back to you 
All the tears I've cried get your coming back to me denied 
A million lies you've put me through 
Now the spark has died 
There's no coming back to you, no coming back to us
