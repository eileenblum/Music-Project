Should the sun not dawn again 
Should the birds not fly 
Should this world come to an end and all left's you and I 
Should the stars all lose their shine 
Should the oceans dry 
Should the angels drop their wings, fall to earth and die
I'll reach for you 

Don't leave me be 
Don't kill my thrill 
Iâve been waiting for you 
Don't leave me be 
Don't kill my thrill 
I'm forever lovin' you 

Should the sun not dawn again 
I will burn the sky 
Should this world come to an end 
I will make it right 
Should the stars all lose their shine 
I will light up mine 
Should your angel drop his wings 
I will help you fly 
I'll reach for you 

Don't leave me be 
Don't kill my thrill 
Iâve been waiting for you 
Don't leave me be 
Don't kill my thrill 
I'm forever lovin' you 

Don't leave me 
I'll be thereâ¦
I'm forever lovin' you

Don't leave me 
I'll be thereâ¦
Forever
