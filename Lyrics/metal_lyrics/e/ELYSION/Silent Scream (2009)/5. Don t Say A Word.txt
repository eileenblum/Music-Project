I feel youDon't say a wordI know how it feels to lose somebodyI see youWalking upon your life aloneLike everybody Nobody knowsWhat's about to happenThe feeling's getting strongHow I long the years of serenityNobody caresWhat's about to happenThe feeling's getting strongHow I long the years of serenity I feel youDon't say a wordNow all I've ever dreamedIs feel somebodyI see youWalking upon your life aloneLike everybody
