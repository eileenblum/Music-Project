Walls between us have become so highI can't bare the lossCan't stand the fightMy devotion turns to dustAnd your guilt won't make it betterAll my feelings for you froze inside Now you want me to forgetCause you know I have no resistanceLook I'm fighting with myself againAll the loss you caused me feelsLike a wound that can't stop bleedingHave to face the truthNo trust in you
