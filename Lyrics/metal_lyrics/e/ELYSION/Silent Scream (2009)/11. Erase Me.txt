I hear noises in the darkAnd hope I only dreamMy head is the only placeWhere I can hear myself All I do is breathing inAll I do is breathing out Erase meFrom all hoping and dreamingAnd wishing on starsErase meInto lonesome obsessionsAnd unhealing scarsErase meThere is no other dawnI am longing to seeErase me... I'm near but my heart is coldMy eyes can't hold the tearsI'm here and my mirror showsMy childhood's ghastly fears What if I want to fade away?Making mistakes I've always made...
