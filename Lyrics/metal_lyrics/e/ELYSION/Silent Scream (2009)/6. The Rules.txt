All our paths are full of thornsBleeding us for realMaking our way so impossibleAnd time is standing still Breaking all the RulesNever thought it's cruelI just wanna see them hangingBreaking all the RulesRising of the foolesI just wanna see them hanging By my rules, yes it's trueThey held me backThey stabbed the knife to the boneBut I'm still alive
