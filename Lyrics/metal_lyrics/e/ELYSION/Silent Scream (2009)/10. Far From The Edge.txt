Far from the edge I'm goingI'm holding my last breathSo many left unsaidIf you could only see meI'm living in your handsYou'll never understand Life or DeathCan you find me the answer?I beg I can see you walkingI can hear you talkingBut in the endI'm alone againWith my eyes of fireBurning my desireAnd in the endI'm alone again Far from the edgeI'm holding my last breathI feel so close to deathIf you could only hear meI'm crying while you standI'm dying feel my hand
