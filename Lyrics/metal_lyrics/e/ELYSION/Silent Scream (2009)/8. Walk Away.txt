Hold your breath until you blowDon't breathe in because they will knowJust where you've beenAnd where you're goingTheir inspiration, stop ignoring Why are you hiding from their sight?There is no winner in this fightThey've been haunting all your lifeThere's no need running, through the nightStand up, wipe away your tearsYou've been against the tide for yearsDon't surrender to this frayJust walk away Now they think you're not that strongYour doors keep shut and prove them wrongYou're soul they wantTo keep it bottledAnd throw it in the dark sea's bottom
