This is my time you will forget itAnd leave it all behindThis is my crime you will regret itFor once you had to fightWhat I'll always will? And I'm bleeding in a meaningInsecure is how I'm feelingI'm bleeding in a meaning This is your timeI won't forget itWon't leave it all behindThis is your crimeI won't regret itFor once I had to fightWhat you'll never will?
