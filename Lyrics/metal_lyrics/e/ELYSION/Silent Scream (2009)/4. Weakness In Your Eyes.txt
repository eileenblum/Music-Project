My eyes are heavyMorpheus comesThe gift that he's carryingIs me in his armsBlue is his veil andStars are his eyesI lay on his handsMy loneliness I cannot stand I've been needin' a handFor too longI've been needin' a friendI'm not strongWill you give me the strength? I believed in youAnd you fooled meWhy? I can see weakness in your eyesSeems you need a handI'm taking your soulAnd I can smell the fear in your heartSeems you need a handI'm taking your soul away Gotta wake upLet me wake upGotta wake upFrom this dream
