They're waitingPatiently for you to make a wishAnd they break itLike a dry leaf under their feet I will be always a dreamerAlways fighting for more than I can haveI will be always a dreamerAnd I'll never think I've had enoughDreams come true if you believe itHit the breaks let no one on your wayI will be always a dreamer SatisfactionUnder the mask of compassion they showTheir reactionTo my standing tall I yearn to know
