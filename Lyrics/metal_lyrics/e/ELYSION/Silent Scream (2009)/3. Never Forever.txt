Im standing alone in the rainFacing the fear withinInside nothing but painWhispering those wordsOnce again inside nothing butEndless darkNever forever senses makeThe love crimesNever forever bloody tearsFor a blind manNever ending love becomes blazeEmotions rape my bodyOnce again lies bleeding at your feetInside nothing but endless dark
