I must have been
Written in pencil
Somewhere on your surface
The depths of you
Reserved for someone else

I lift and flake
And then Iâm gone
With one quick breath
Soft and bruised
I linger
Soft and bruised

And you are there
For all the world to see
My shell translucent
And you are there
For all the world to see
And you are there for all the world

The depths of you are now carved
Carving in my bones
The depths of you are now carved in my bones
On my surface.
And you are there
For all the world to see
Carving in my bones
The depths of you are lost
