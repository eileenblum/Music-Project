I'm sure you don't see me staring into your pale face
I'm sure

I'm sure you do not see me staring into your pale face
Counting the lines around your mouth
A method precise
As I paint your lonely blank sigh onto my minds blank canvas
I make my careful unpenned notes reflect
The red rims around bloodshed irises

Your blotchet skin and cracked down lips
As I paint your lonely blank sigh onto my minds blank canvas
And I'm sure that my image and my fragments reflect in your eyes
And now I will

Now shatter these fragments

They tell me my own sad stories
At night
They tell me my own stories

And I'm still sure you don't see me staring into your pale face
I'm sure

I'm sure you do not see me staring into your pale face
Counting the lines around your mouth
A method precise

Fragments!
Now shatter these fragments
Shatter!
