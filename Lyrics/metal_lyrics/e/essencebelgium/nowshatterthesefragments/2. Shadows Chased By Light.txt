As a drop of rain dries on my lips
And the wind rustles through my hair
The moment has come to say farewell and the seconds tick away
As shadows chased by light

The sound of your voice has vanished
And the memories make my blood calcify
And they scar my own image
Last words you said made me feel so fucking helpless
And the last breath you took made me feel all alone
All alone

I try to walk away
Away from it all
But my own footsteps are hunting me
Night falls along with me

Last words you said made me feel so fucking helpless
And the last breath you took made me feel all alone
All alone

As a drop of rain dries on my lips
And the wind rustles through my hair
The moment has come to say farewell and the seconds tick away
As shadows chased by light
Shadows
Chased
By light

They scar myself
They scar my own image
Make my skin crawl and whisper

Last words he said made me feel so fucking helpless
And last breath he took made me feel all alone
So fucking alone
Fucking alone
The last words he said made you feel so fucking helpless
