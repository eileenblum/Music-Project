Did something snap inside of me, sicken and deform
Tap a hidden illness deep inside.
Release my violent energy, repeat the senseless kill.
Caught red handed in the act of crime.
Fear engulfs my state of mind, numbs my train of thought.
Future hanging in the balance, will the state require my demise?

Time, the space of empty years to pass me by.
Solitude, life repossessed, parole to be denied.
Without panic, a loophole found.
Fragmented inner workings of my mind.

Time has slowed, the trial is near, the lies will pave the way.
Truth evaded, conjuring excuses to be made.
Memory is fragmented I wallow in decay.
My dreams are blurred with consciousness, the night seeps into day.

My day of trial draws closer still.
Emotions burned as pressure builds.
Collect your thoughts, act the charade.
Will freedom call, which road to take.

Immoral acts stain my brain, horror from within.
No remorse for victims who have passed.
Now on judgment day I pleas insanity.
Cold blooded murderer at heart.
No bargains from the state, the court becomes my prey.
Pass the buck, shift the blame.
Fuck the system, free to kill again
