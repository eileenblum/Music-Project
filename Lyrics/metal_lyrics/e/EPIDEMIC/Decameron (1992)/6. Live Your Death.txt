Burning fire in your brain, having no control of this game.
See your empty life all around, life and death both around.

Scream in pain, for life.
For death...live your death!

Not knowing which way you want to go.
Indecision for yourself.
Not making sense of past events.
Complacency itself.
Life will take a life on this frightful day.
Searching for the truth.
Can the chance be taken to end it all.
The never ending quest.

The pain within ceases to halt.
Frenzied state no one's fault.
Execution of your soul.
See the light but you can't.

Scream in pain, for life.
For death...live your death
