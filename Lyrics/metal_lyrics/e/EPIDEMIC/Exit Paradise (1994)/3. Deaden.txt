The making of a mind without
The process of error
To lose access, to control
The greater of all thought without
Fear or emotion
To program to think to learn
Technology abyss
Mass productions of the errorless
Minds
Soon a helpless maker
Robotic genetics
Limitations in reality
Artificial intelligence

Assemble, construct the thought
Pattern
Deadly repercussions of science
No thoughts of self
Breaking down the mind
Under one control, forging
Obedience like a dog
Complete domination
Electricity the life's blood
Walking thin lines
To deaden is to live
Efficiency without feeling
Now your soul is lost

Wielding immense power
Without fear or emotion
In man's struggle
The rights of life
Uniform command
Erosion in all unity
Imprisoned by intelligence
Imprisoned by progress
Industrial empire
The greater of all thought
Production of a mind
The power of creation
Now a silent God

Trapped in this hollow shell
Trapped in the abyss
Technological cell
Electronic living hell
In this anarchy lives
Among the strong
I shall stand
I will never surrender
I live
