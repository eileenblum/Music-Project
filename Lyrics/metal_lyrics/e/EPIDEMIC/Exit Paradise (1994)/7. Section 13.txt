Hammering pulse pumps blood of fear
Gut centered dread
Now builds inside of me
Conceal the crime, is it worn on my
Face
To cross the border free
Cornered and trapped, secret
Revealed
Cold press of chains
Wrapped around my wrist
Mind sinking, flooded with fear
Captive alone to an unknown future
Why?

My action I wish I could deny
Tension to flood awaiting trial
Feel the panicked regret
Drowning my mind

Deny my fate, oppression
Strengthened
Manipulate and overcome,
Await no longer
Status down, section 13
Commanding sacrifice
Frreak parade, well past insanity
Life of the old machine
Bury pain, shoving, nonexistent
Will to surpass is reigning power

Constant watch, guarded and caged
Living day to day
Broken feet, broken will
The beatings numb my frozen mind
Example set, freedom denied
Plotting escape of these four walls
Prison life, kept below
Reaching the end I snap and
Overthrow

Fifty three days turned into forever
Endless solitude
Status revoked, from a man to a slave
The dawn of my decay
Deterrent, in human form
I rot for all to see in misery
Controlled by a force still unknown
For a gram of the black
I'm imprisoned a lifetime

Attempting escape, all hope set to
Rise
Snatched from my mind
In one swift motion
Scapegoat conceived, precedent set
Feelings of safety fade
Submit and die, against my will
Discipline, lock down,
Endure this punishment
Backstabbing pigs, pushing me further
Rip the tongue from my mouth
Beat and tear the animal is born

Will to live
Strength will give
Now I'm free
They can't hold me
