Numb body blank emotion
Senses dulled feelings frayed
Life chord severed torn betrayed
Now born avoid I've never known
Blank stiff stare
Focus on nothing
The blur between my severed mind

Can you feel my voids in yours
Can you feel my rage below
Deeper down I push the pain
Could not foresee the final blow

Tightening knot clenched innards
The numbness ebbs and fades
An anger burns
Ripped from within me bled dry
Drain exit complete
Escape the emptiness

Mindless motions of each day
Here in the after
Nothing feels the same
What was to burn
What flared then broke
Beneath the strain

And to the past I steer my mind
And sink into my thoughts
For here I see you clearest
As the present blurs
And slips from vision
But as each day fades to the next
Your place in my mind deepens
I resist, tighten my loossened grip
And feel the void consume

Feel the cruel fade of time
Image sinking, open wound
Smothered flame once burned
To ash descend, lifeline to end
So cold
