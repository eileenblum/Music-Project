Stressing the fracture
Breathing brings pain
Though infinity remains
Strength is gone
Provoke the confrontation
Building strain burning combustion
Everlasting stain

Hunt begins, over time
Inching closer the pray am I
Then divide, circle low
Into the system vultures go

Lashing out at those who are pure
You stare right through me
The dull rusty edge
That has become my mood
You are sold you bought the mold
And now your eyes see only
The place you think I hold
In the machine
That owns your sold

I defy your sunken mind
To judge me by your own design
Hypocrite laughter, averted gaze
You drift through life in robotic
Haze

Breeding, slowly shaping
Manipulating, twisted shape
Conforms
Now locked in motion of the blind

When did they start
To mold your thoughts
Trained to be one of many
When did you shut off
Questions in your mind
Betray yourself and fall in line
Where status now dictates the rule
Loss of all hope, failed source
The hardened mold constricts
What once was free
Society's victim, you

You choke on yours
I'll choke on mine
To your hypocruÂ­sy you're blind
Below the surface
Who do you despide
Your feeble self stripped of their lie
