Investing into lies
Preaching opinions to the masses
The views of one
Controlling the thoughts of others
The power of lies
Influence on weakened minds
Retaining thoughts
Lowering value of human minds

Manipulated trust
To oppress imressionable lives
A movable mass
To achieve what they want
Fuelled by ignorance
A symbol of the teacher
The blind lamb
A symbol of the masses

Confinied, imprisoned, caged
My thoughts restrained
Distorted and contorted
Selfish thoughts aborted

Tom, wom, conformed
The young newborn
Incarcerated
Raped of their minds
Institution of ignorance

Paralyzed intellect
Building on the fear of others
Susceptive mental state
Naive personality
Freezing of minds
Judgement impaired, deadly
Subjects lacking faith
Those in power lacking knowledge
