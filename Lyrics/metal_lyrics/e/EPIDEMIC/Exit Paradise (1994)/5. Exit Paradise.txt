Day of exit, forever stained
The final choice to pass the pain
Racing heartbeat, panicked breath
To trade useless life for death
Passage out, strength caves in
Dismal flame flickers from the din
Thread disconnecting, you shiver
Away from the sick of it all
Which way is up
Which way is out
Sinking, screaming
The abyss opens down

If you could deny
If you could forgive
If you could just let go

Behind those sleepless eyes
Blinding fatal light
From yourself you fall

The day would you deny
The world could you forgive
It's crime that led to yours

Step further away
