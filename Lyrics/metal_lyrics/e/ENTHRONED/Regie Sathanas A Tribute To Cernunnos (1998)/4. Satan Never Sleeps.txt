My life, hatred, nights beside your dreams, branding our souls,
when the forces of hell make total mayhem on earth.
A silence in the night reign with fear in honour to never lost Satan!
A silence, before the fight which is near.

Invoking you to clear myself oooh! Unholy dark father,
Invoking you to clean the world of the bastard Jesus Christ
Invoking your far from your depths by my own death dark father.
Invoking you far from your depths by my own death Lucifer!

As malicious as a fool "fire",
charged with perverseness never before seen on earth,
He treats Christians as the lost souls in hell are treated
He has a multitude of names and is capable to disappear at will,
He will spread more ecclesiastic blood than anyone could imagine.

Satan never sleeps!!!

Horrible pestilence, total armageddon, made more marvellous by
the famine before, and the great strife and tribulations which have
never happened since the foundation of the Christian church, will
descend upon the land after twenty five years, the worst of all wars
will be fought and the most evil, of atrocity committed in the name
of Satan almost the entire world will be defeated and desolate.
