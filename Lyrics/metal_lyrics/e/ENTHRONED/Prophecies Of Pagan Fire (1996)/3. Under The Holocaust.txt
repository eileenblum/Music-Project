Reborn through the breeze in a snowstorm
in front of thirteen black brilliants candles
reflecting under my eyes, and letting reappear
the Medieval visions of my ancient empire.

Prince Lucifer, powerful you buried my corpse
and keep my spirit, to challenge the good in the
name of evil and to declare an endless war,
with the torment of the infernal legions.

I'm the son of the moon, emperor of the war,
I'm the one who unleash the hate
I'm the denial of all benevolence
I prepare my holocaust
I shall kill without pity...

"I raise the inverted cross, in the nightside eclipse...
His eyes shall watch me in battle.
Under the storming holocaustsky,
thy kingdom of heaven will be destroyed forevermore,
under the throne of the horned king,
under the sign of the horned one..."

The whole universe, will then recognize
the supreme power of Satan, who will retake
his throne for eternity and will reign forever.
Beyond the snowclad hills, and the icy mountains
a vast field of crucified, and impaled is stretching.

They're perishing in the blackness of darkness
and soulless of their soul
for centuries lost in Lucifer's kingdom.
And endlessly the bloody rivers flows!
And the maleficiant strengths delivered from
their abyss are raging.

Again the empire of evil,
will shine and my domain of terror,
will keep his powerful majesty,
under the glittering brillance of the moon,
and under the sign of the great iron hammer, sign of Thor.
