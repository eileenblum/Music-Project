Judas the only one who hasn't lied to us
You remain faithful by showing,
the world hypocrite and merciless
in the name of the demons and the powers of hell,
Christians I damn you making the sign of pentagram

I do call you great Master Satan
from the bottom of darkness, the strengths breakout
I feel them ready to bit,
I made serious offenses, and lived like a sinner...

Ave Satan... ave, ave, ave...

To satisfy, my love for you
Oooh Satan's servant!!!
I grave my soul
I adjured the blood, that flows in my veins...

And shall continue to an immortal life
life in your name, life...
