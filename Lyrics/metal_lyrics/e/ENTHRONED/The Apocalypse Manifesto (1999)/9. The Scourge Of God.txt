Known as "The Scourge of God" Attila united the Huns who were various tribes of mongoloid warriors, invading the Roman empire from 436 to 453 c.c.
Attila murdered his own brother to gain sole control over the Hunnish empire, which ranged from the Rhine river to the Ural and as far North to the Baltic Sea.
The unholy king conquered land to the Danube river to form the southern border of his almighty empire.

By now Attila, The Great One, will share a throne of pain with Bleda The Weak:
"But a half king is nothing, there's no place in my ranks for feeble souls.
So, my brother, it is time for you to die."
Attila king Etzel he became to ride proud through Illyria destroying all feeble Christian dogs from the Black to the Mediterranian seas.

452 c.c.

Twenty years full of victories and pride had passed !
with the Ostrogoth's allegiance whom he had conquered, the son of fire invaded the barbaric lands of Gaul, without an ounce of fear trusting in his faithful archers.

Stopped by Roman general Fabius Aetius in Mediolanum lord Attila held his march to claim his strength.
Fabius proposed a pact to leader in war.
