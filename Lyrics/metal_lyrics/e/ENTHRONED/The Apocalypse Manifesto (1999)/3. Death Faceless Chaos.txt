Near the voice of NASTUR in his almightyness hear the whispering afflicting 
the crapulent stormrace in the middle of the unspeaking eye. In the black 
night maze !! near the yell his breadth through his serpent-fangs...Tearing 
the holy silence apart. For the holy silence apart. For the cursed faceless 
one is processing the funeral sound of our almighty. Blackend Hordes our 
hate our wills are his power released for the glory of our redeemer.

[CHORUS]
Who has know all the evil before us,
The tyrannical secrets of time?
Though my match not the dead man that bore us...
Though the heathen outface and outlive us...
And our lives and our laughing are twain
Forgive us our virtues, forgive us our lady of pain.
DEATH FACELESS CHAOS

&lt;&lt; I am the master-spirit who live down below
Below any human kind, behind evevry sorrow
Down in hell my obscurity evolve in the way of hatred
For the splendour of torture and the joy of pain.

I m NASTUR the great black one king of the damned.
Prince of destruction through these arts
I puke my passion of uninvited dissection and drown myself into 
putrefaction.... &gt;&gt;
My delite of disgust my disgust of delight lead me to the
irremediable thought that all the one live the darkness.

In the middle of all lives the one who is all darkness..
And darkness will be eternalsince everyting bows before the lord !
Under the Nellish frozen chants of our demons.
The faceless one is processing through god's own decandence !
Screaming to death, the laws of ouyr infernal chaos !
Die with company in eternal hell of the most tormented souls !!!

[CHORUS]
Who has know all the evil before us,
The tyrannical secrets of time?
Though my match not the dead man that bore us...
Though the heathen outface and outlive us...

DEATH FACELESS CHAOS.
Cursed faceless one defying the holy dogs.
DEATH FACELESS CHAOS.
The ultimate hammer of war in the face of god.
