For all tortured soul down there. Listen......I m the satanic spirit who 
commands all the Romans the oruel ones to crucify the bastard christ. when 
the eagle of Rome perscute god's children, I had drunk their blood and raped 
their daughters.

For all tortured soul down there. Listen......I m the hatred who to the 
slaves of evil teh blind ones to crush the holy son when the industries of 
inferno burnt teh children of god. I had breath their ashes and crush the 
holy son when the industries of inferno burnt the children of god, I had 
breath their ashes and vomit war out.

[CHORUS:]
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !

I m the invincible force who command to your leaders, the unholy ones who 
shall set the world on fire, when the nuclear sword rape the earth from part 
to part. I shall set the flames of impurity and small the stench.....Of 
thousand million martyrs their ashes shall be blast by the storm to form 
black cloud and cover the sun.
A dead cloud planet is all that shall remains and let my spirit free 
forever.

[CHORUS:]
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
volkermord, antigott !
