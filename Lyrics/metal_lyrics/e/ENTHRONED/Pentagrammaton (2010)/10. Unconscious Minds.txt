Lost in the hunger of knowledge
Hungry for more
Incapable to satiate the addiction of truth
Deaf to all
The power is as a deadly narcotic swirling in veins

Wander endlessly into grimoires and pamphlets
Until the gasp gets no more
Drowning within an own self affliction
Blinded by what was once preached

To the call of humility shall join the patterns of experience
To the call of ability shall join the characters of intelligence

One might be cursed by his own flock
By no meaning shall this close the door
Refusing your gifts due to the mistakes one should do

As every steps no matter what
Is another goal crossed in our evolution
To what made us what we are
As beings parts of the plot
But so easy it is to fail when hunger goes beyond
Our primal senses and their unconscious minds
Never forget thy fate shall be sealed on the path of wisdom: "Learn and keep silence!"

To the call of humility shall join the patterns of experience
To the call of ability shall join the characters of intelligence
