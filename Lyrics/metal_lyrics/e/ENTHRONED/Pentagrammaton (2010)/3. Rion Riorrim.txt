The light will spawn clear, bright and white at dawn
Suddenly deep in the Black Iris, piercing as the eyes of Apophis

The light will shine and I will stand in line
To be blessed so many times, every day and as much as I'm worth

The light will rise on the path of the wise
Cleansing the dirt at once, the dirt of ignorance

Forneus will bind and open the eyes of the blind
For it's time to see the brightness of darkness
The light is here to reveal myself to me

As Buer smiles in the mirror
Introducing himself with my name
Through the scrying void
I command my self to thee

Bestia Centavri Imperivm
Maxime hvc homines
Bves praeses Magnvs
Ocvla habens Serptentinam
