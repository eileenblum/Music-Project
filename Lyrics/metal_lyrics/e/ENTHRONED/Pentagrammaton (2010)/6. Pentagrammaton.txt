There is more than one God, more than one path
Through the vast multi-verse of potentialities
The Quantum Kabbalah eternally branches out
I have come into being: Hermanubis Nexhagus
Elder Jester of the pre-created, weaver of chromosomes
I have risen, to reveal the new aeonic formula

By the same mouth which earths us
Birth us and devour us, Od and Ob entwine
So shall we all be divine
We come and go, to and from the fifth
For it is the axis of the other four
So the name also shall be mine: Xeper

Yeshva, Yeshva, Yeshva
Vestri sperma nomen
Diapente vox astrvm
Cvrator ab Senivm

There is more than one God, more than one path
Through the vast multi-verse of potentialities
The Quantum Kabbalah eternally branches out
I have come into being

By the same mouth which earths us
Birth us and devour us, Od and Ob entwine
So shall we all be divine

I am the keeper of my ways
The sabbat goat now on the burning Pentagram
Revealing he who is Octinomos
The eye on the wheel, now again spinning widdershins
Re-versed from creator to destroyer
Grunting his five divine letters
By the same mouth which spoke the new words of truth
Pentagrammaton re-turns
