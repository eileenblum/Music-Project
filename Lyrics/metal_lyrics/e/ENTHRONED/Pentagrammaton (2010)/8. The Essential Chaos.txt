Thou Creator of mortals
Ascribe ye praise to my shade, the lord of all
Life, Strength and Health, the maker of the gods
Give ye thanks unto me in my beneficent form
Which is enthroned in Tuat
Thine enemy, the serpent hath been given over to the fire
Let me destroy Aepep at the moment of his greatest power
Honor me as the essential chaos

Open is the land of Unu
Shut is the head of Thoth
Perfect is the eye of Horus
That I have delivered as the ornament of the eye of Ra

I am the whisper by my brother who dwelleth in Amentet
Who knoweth his day, which cometh to an end
For I am Set, the Father of the Gods
I shall never come to an end

Perished enthroned in Tuat
Thine enemy, the serpent hath been given over to the fire
Let me destroy Aepep

I shall forever be reborn
Again and again...
To speak these words of truth
Honor me as the essential law
Honor me as the essential chaos
