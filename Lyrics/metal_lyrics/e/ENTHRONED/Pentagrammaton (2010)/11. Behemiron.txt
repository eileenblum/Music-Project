I believe in the seed of Behemoth
Pater of matter and Ether
Nothing is true, all is permitted
Order is nil and Chaos is king
Liberty above truth
Pestilence and putrid doctrines

Reign! Behemiron reign!

We are his breath, his dishonoring sword
We ask, we want the bate of our sins
Now the world, tomorrow solar extentions

We breed through Eschaton, invoking Pandaemon!

Reign! Behemiron reign! At last!
