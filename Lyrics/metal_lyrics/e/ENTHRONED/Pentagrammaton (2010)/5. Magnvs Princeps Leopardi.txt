Look not thou upon my swine
Thou that tarry long at life's own wine
As there stare the eyes of disclosed secrets
Reveal the lust and rejoice
When thine envy falleth
The candle of the wicked
Shall never be put out
Thine heart shall utter perverse thoughts
Thou shalt be as he that lieth down

In the midst of my crimson sea
Magnus Princeps Leopardi

Be not thou envious against the seeking men
Neither desire to be amongst us
For our heart studieth construction

Incendit virum mulieris amore
In the midst of my crimson sea
Magnus Princeps Leopardi

Mulierem vicissim aeterius
Desiderio incitat
Thine heart shall utter perverse thoughts
Thou shalt be as he that lieth down
