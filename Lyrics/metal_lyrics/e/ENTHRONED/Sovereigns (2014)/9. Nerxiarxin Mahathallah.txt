Hear your child!
Born of a voice untimely
the echo of men's ordure
dropped in a wood consciously.
Nurturers!
What do you want from me??
I shall bring thee to honour
when thou dost embrace me.

"Bringest me my due" as thou sayest
I will not bring it to thee!
Ask me not, what thou canst not learn from me.
I am she who reflects unto thee!

I am Deception
I deceive and weave
Thoth-out-Thoth
I whet and excite heresies
Thoth-out-Thoth

"Bringest me my due" as thou sayest
I will not bring it to thee!
Ask me not, for thou canst not learn from me.
I am she who reflects unto thee!
Slithering...
towards a lonely logic truth
I cause you unworthy to scatter and fall
I shall bring you a well deserve misery!
Yk Nerxiarxin Mahathallah!

Thus spoke Machaloth
