Forsooth, surely and without doubt
what is below is similar to what is above
and what is above is mirrored with the below
to produce the miracle of one thing

As all things are born from the unique
the meditation of the single
as derivation are born from the unique
when we become "Whole"

Split the Earth from the flames
what is precious from what is rough
and rise what is earthly to the skies
Conquering therefore the light of the white
and feed the light of the shades

Sole reverser of mentalities
...the two faces of the divine
Sole reverser of mentalities
...the two faces of the end
Sole reverser of mentalities
...the two faces of the start
Sole reverser of mentalities
...those two faces of mine

It is the strength amongst strengths
as it is a victorious one
the elusive which fornicates all that is solid
and extraneous to my realm,
a divine coagulation;
the two faces of the divine

Thus spoke Haagenti
