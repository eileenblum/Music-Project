Fire!

Mine is this yesterday of the tails of cobras,
that Ennead, beings of the West
Whom Horus has illumined,
and who witnesses against Seth
I emerged from the Primeval Waters of Nu
Came into being by My Own

Heru-ra-ha
By My Cry the world got filled
Heru-ra-ha
By all which I had not known
Heru-ra-ha
my house is the Pride
that comes before the fall
I am the Light, the Shining One
And the pyre that devours all

Enter my child with woe, with mirth
I am the Alpha through Omega
Phenex, Binnu Bird
Heru-ra-ha!

Mine is the cycle dividing today from tomorrow,
Ascension and descent, wisdom revealed
for everything great is built upon sorrow
in all that is sweet goes terror concealed.

Thus Spoke Phenex
