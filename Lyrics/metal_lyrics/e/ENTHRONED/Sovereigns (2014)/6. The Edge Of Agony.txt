Triumph is the first syllabus
I despise your kind
weak, frightened
in the face of reality
do you feel my blade inside your pluck?

You proved your worth, earn my awe
Now shall you call upon the second Mercurial Count,
I shall be obliged, I shall be obliged,
SamaÃ«l be my witness...

Do not foul yourself with joy
as victory is not eternal.
The man staring back in the mirrors of old
will always reflect your triumph of failures.
Keep it high and my guidance will be yours
let it go and my blade will kiss your flesh.

You proved your worth, earn my awe
Now shall you call upon the second Mercurial Count,
I shall be obliged, I shall be obliged,
SamaÃ«l be my witness...

but thou art toddler and my blood
and until we meet again I'll love and slaughter
your siblings with all my heart and rusted...
...steel!

Thus spoke Botis
