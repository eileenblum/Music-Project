Primigenian fluids, emanating black nectars from the hidden path.
A forbidden fruit still to be devoured.
Through poisonous breath we invoke the ancientlores.
The Primigenian call to the ones of Azoth...

Sepulchred Within Opaque Slumber.
Debetvr Soli Gloria Vera Satanas.
A whispering call.
An Invocation in the helix of the red Gods.

Stellar Mantras call my name
In Tongues of fire we drink the elexirs of immortallity.

A shimmering call...
The voices within my blood gathers as one.
Canting the lores of our ancient path.
Splitted then forged within.

Sepulchred Within Opaque Slumber.
Consecrated unto our hidden masks we rise.
Primary valued atavisms from the shadows.
The hidden face of the spirit I am!
The mask of deathis my name!
Sepulchred Within Opaque Slumber.
