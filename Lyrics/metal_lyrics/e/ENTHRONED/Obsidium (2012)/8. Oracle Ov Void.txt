Lost and blind through desert sand.
Enlighten by the secret eye, 
Pale horns shining through dense black corridors, 
A sacred fire burning, 
A sacred fire burning inside, to self-wisdom.

A path has shown crossroads to the void. 
A path has shown crossroads, 
a translucid dreaming.

Quintessence: a voice of silence 
crawling within the nature 
of self evocative serpents fire. 

I am the flame: I am the gate 
and the key of hidden mysteries, 
of unknown visions, 
of unspoken words!

Beyond the gateless gate, 
a sun... an eye... an opal eve... 
lo Sethos! 

I am the flame: I am the gate 
and the key... 
I am all. 
I am nothing.

Upon the sea of stone I float, 
under the desert and I shall burn. 
Wooden mirrors masked 
in pale faceless forms 
Grey shadows, show me the path.
