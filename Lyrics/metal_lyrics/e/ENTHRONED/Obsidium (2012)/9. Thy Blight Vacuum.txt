Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
I have sworn and I shall perform, that I will keep thy righteous judgements.
I am afflicted so deeply, quicken me. 
O Lord, according to thy word.
The wicked, the devil have laid a snare for me. 
O Lord are you listening to my prayer.
Filthy worm! Father, the silent ones call out to me gambling from the time we wake till the day ends.
But how am I to get you? Rising truth to the skies, and "clarity" shall be taken up into the heavens.
"Accept. I beseech thee the freewill offerings of my mouth..."
Faggot! I shall be the spear within the heart of humanity cleansing your innocence within urine &amp; blood.
Through the vacuums, we are born! I shall be the spear within the heart of Christianity cleansing your innocence within urine &amp; blood.
Through the vacuums, we are born! The dark lord offers us vacuums of assessment the waves of torment are there for us all forever more, 
the waves of salvation cleansing futility away.
The waves of depression will wash away them all to the waves of serenity I am invitede to go.
My virtues may be red as crimson .
Through the vacuums I am reborn. I shall go on and on and no soul in this world will know where we are. I shall go on and on.
