As a corrupted spring.
The "righteous man" falls down before the wicked.
For the men to search their own glory is not glory.
He that has no rule over his own spirit is like a broken edifice.
Without its walls.
Recognition is not seemly for a fool.

Sew the lips and nail the tongue of the pretender.
Thorns through the limbs of those figures of great failure.
Swarm of rats, vermins of the saviour.
as the dove tangled within barbed wire.
Limping oblivious shades.

Come behind my eyes.
A whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod as for the fools daily bread.
As coals are to the burning coals and wood to the fire.
So is a contentious man to kindle strife.

Thy ghostly self shall be chewed and disappear within the depths of your own deceive.
They call out o your blind sight.
Canting from dusk 'til dawn, on and on the Gospel of blood, but howis it to become whole?

Shall you come to the edge f reason or stand which eyes tight shut?
Thou so gracioulsy ill shade of grey.
The face of righteousness shall be the everlasting embrace within thy blood and devoured soul.
