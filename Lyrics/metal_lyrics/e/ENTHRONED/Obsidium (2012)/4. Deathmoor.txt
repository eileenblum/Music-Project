It is that I am of pure heart and steady soul that I undertook these paths in sacred trust.
No will for curiosity or thrill's sake enters the house of death.
Free from fear.
Substance I do notrecognize for havereplaced it by symbiosis and violent humility.

Deathmoor.
It is that I desire to be Azrael's emparthy.
Willingly taking on his burden.
To know all of death's forms and shrink away from none greeting each as one would welcome firm flesh into thy bed.

Never for my own device.
Violated the sanctity of death's domain nor the catalysts that lays within.
Nor shall I force invitation when none is extended to me, myself and I.
To know all of death's forms and shrink away from none greeting each as one would welcome firm flesh into thy bed.

For to do thy will grand, to do the will of the one is glorious!
