Distant stars in wintersky,
Blood on a frozen fields at dawn of a chaotic doomsday,
The battalions of immortals gathered
Under the heretic banner at the portal,
Where the fire inflamne the holy ground.
Coming from a blind light,
A formation of angels consume, by the abyssical vortex,

Another forthcoming age without sunlight,
Just a dead star above a plaguewinter wolrd,
Cold like a corpse carved in stone.
Several nuclear stars have damaged the earth surface.
Now the world is materialized without any alive cells.

A vision of Holocoust ridingon the wings of Human hope
The crimson Legions scorch the earth under TIAMAT'S eye,
The servants of the light,
Aspotels of god are enslaved by the forces o chaos
And chainfed to the walls of hell for eternity.

Humanity decayed, their souls are rippin'appart,
Their flesh grilled by XAPHAN'S fire,
Their bones crushed into the dead soil.
Crimson Legions.
