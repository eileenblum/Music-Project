[Lead: Nornagest]

Sunset night's gloom falls on folorlorn horizons
I wander the wasted pahts of the barren land.
The blade sunning in the moonlight, sharpend to slice thru the soul of God,
And bring forth the Demon Hordes, from the bowels of the Earth... (Night Stalker)
I walk upon the scattered corpses lying down the fields.

Hatred burning inside me, vomiting blood upon the cross
Hatred burning through my heart, needing to reap the Christian God,
Hatred filling my veins, the mark of Satan upon my skin.
Tonight is the night of blood,
You shall all be taken by the Night Stalker...
Murderer... Darkest Reaper!!!
Night Stalker!!!

[Solo: Nornagest]

Hatred binding my force, willing me to crush the bones of Human kind,
Hatred blending my seed, with the blood of Virgins I ride.
Hatred burning through my pain, to condemn humans to breaking strain...
This night the bounds of Terror shall be broken he will be unleashed,
The Night Stalker... Night Stalker... Night Stalker...

[Solo: N. Daemon]
