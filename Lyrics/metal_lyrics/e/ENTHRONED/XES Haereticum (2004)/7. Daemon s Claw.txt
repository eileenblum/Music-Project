Many scripts i wrote about the way to torture the holy,
My soul's still hungry...
I cannot turn around... Try to forget it.

I came out nowhere, born from ashes.
My blood's boiling, inside me, the Demon of anger I'll alaways be.

Reaper of morality,
I'll take your forevermore.
Bringer of Agony... die by the Demon's Claw.

Frozen memories of what they did to me are ripping me from inside,
Am i born to kill???

[Solo: Nornagest]

Occult powers are not even enough to appease my dementia,
I am a infernal breed, forever condamned to hell.
