Lead Nornagest

Take Me!!!

[Nornagest:]

Blank eyes in sight
Empty body for a soul full of sorrow
Confusion is growing in me,
Spining wihtin my blood,
"Razors are hammering"

[Sabathan:]

Despair: silent screams are hurting my hears,
Anger: motionless, hatred is burning my senses,
Feelings: frozen scarves of my darkest past.
Solution: self-destruction.

Endless waitings, slow sufferings,
The SATANA-test is exciting my wond... my wound...

[Chorus]
[both Nornagest/Sabathan:]

It's turning and turning into my head, confusion's turning me to insane,
Tell me your choice, tell me my destiny across the Vortex of confusion.

[Solo: N.Daemon]

[Nornagest:]

At once, the kiss of the wolf sat my heart on fire,
Yet another scarve melted into Lava's spellbound,
My body's burning and my soul once again petrified in time... In time!!!

[Solo : Nornagest]
[Solo : Nornagest]
[Lead : Nornagest]

My scarves are still bleeding remains of my darkes past,
A new age shall erise, a new man is born... Oh Lord....
Take Me!!!

[Lead : Nornagest]
