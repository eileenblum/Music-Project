I, the personification of hatred
Destrictive being, attendance of the Meratreg
I bring to thee the endless turbulences of "my death".
I, the personification of wrath
Infectious virus, bringer of sickness.
My twisted tempts,
Are covering the sun of "your miserable existence".
I, the personification of perfection
Splendor and Almighty creation of myself
I am the filthy seed, procreated by the horns.
The heart of darkness, the eye of the beholder.

Phantasms of the living
For a stink called world
Illusions of human realism
Only sterile blackness prevail
Emptiness and loneliness...
Blacker than black

"Black blood within human flesh....
Prevail the anti cosmic essence of times!!!"

I am the reminder of what men forgot:
THe reality of death, the mirage of life.
At the edge of existence I stand, waiting in silence, the moment...
I am the representation of despair
I am the stone around your leg, the canon watching your brain.
Suicide incitation, I am here e there just for my listeners.
I am blacker the black

Phantasms of the living
For a stink called world
Illusions of human realism
Only sterile blackness prevail
Darkness and lifeless...
Blacker than black
