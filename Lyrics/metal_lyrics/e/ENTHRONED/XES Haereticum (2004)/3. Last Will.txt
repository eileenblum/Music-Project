Listen, the insane sound of my last thoughts
Like cut-throat your mind and darken my eyes,
Rule all directions, turn Altar to grave,
Sacrifice on reasons and catch the will of men.

...And under all rodies, the enslaved nature is done,
The hunger for insanity spring through everything.

[Chorus]
Raise the arms forged in misfortune,
BReak the silence from far away and their mysteries.

I'am the onte who'll take the Path
From below in sulphurg landscapes
Where hope can never dwell,
Rule all directions, turn altars to grave,
Sacrifice on reasons and catch the will of men.

[Chorus]
Raise the arms forged in misfortune,
BReak the silence from far away and their mysteries.
