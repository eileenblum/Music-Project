No other words could be found to explain those verses i sing,
My hatred created by human fag, can i live? should i die ?
My lord is calling me, my father sing for my return...
I know that my time isn't finished yet on these grounds
The mission that he gives me to spread his laws,
I haven't completed! no fiction, no lies!!!

Father, hear thy son acclaiming your grandeur,
Dweller, give me them back what they gave you...
We're only waiting for your...

ARMOURED BESTIAL HELL....
......Till the end......!!!

APOCALYPTIC revelations after "THE MANIFESTO"
the ones who sang the hymns are back... we know that the "time"
isn't finished yet on these grounds...
OOOHHHH, i feel thy presence within my blood

[lead norbagest]

Worms, the sky of your heart will be fulfilled by rain and thunder
The strangulations of your hypocrisy will fell
Your health will turn into an incessant fire... burn...f ire... burn

The kingdom of my father has arrived, he brang with him all his gifts...
be the one fo us,
Be the chosen one. Flesh, blood is all we need...
your sufferings will exalt your sense...

ARMOURED BESTIAL HELL.... ARMOURED BESTIAL HELL.... ARMOURED BESTIAL HELL....
