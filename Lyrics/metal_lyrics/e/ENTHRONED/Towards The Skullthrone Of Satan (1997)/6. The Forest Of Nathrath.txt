In the nocturnal fog, shadows dancing
and whisper the Satanic Glory,
before the flags of hate and lies
embrace themselves, there on the hills.
The pentagram hordes, the riders of doom,
drink the christmen blood.
tomorrow we'll hunt them
beyond the dark forest, beyond the blood...
In the forest of NATHRATH!

War til death, war til the end.
Spilling the ecclesiatsics blood,
invoking the supreme shield of eternity.

Annhahal NATHRATH!
Huffah Bethud urieh dielveh!
HAIL SATHANAS!

From my altar, I invoke the dark age,
the battle against Christianity.
now the day of perveristy, our day!
Today we treat Christians
like damned souls were treated by their god!
After the master will be the infernal prince,
again by the last time
all Christian's kingdom will shive by fire.

The flag of hate, sons of perdition we arise us.
black souls against god's concept to slay you all.
In the forest of NATHRATH!

Annhahal NATHRATH!
Huffah Bethud urieh dielveh!
HAIL SATHANAS!

From my demon-horse I observe the battle against Christianity.
now the nearest victory our will, the carnage is done.
there in the woods... in the forest of NATHRATH!

This was the tales... of the Satanic wars.
the battle of hate and lies!
Of hate and lies!!!
