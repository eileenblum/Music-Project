[music: Morbid Death, 1989, lyrics: Cernunnos]

Satanas, fallen one by this nail commences, Nazarene,
mutilations, morbid death, suffering awaits him while he is
crucified on the cross...Go away blessed whore...
Blessed whore...blessed whore!!!

Hellish strenght, grand-Goat war, antichrist,
from the pits of Hell!!!
Diabolic Force...Diabolic Force...Diabolic Force!!!
Rising high, grand Goat-war, antichrist,
from the pits of Hell!!!
Diabolic Force...Diabolic Force...Diabolic Force!!!

[Lead: Nornagest]

Suddenly the pest is growing inside me, 
the devil invest my soul with all my pride.
The dismembered remains of the nazarene
lies beneath my feet,
now covered in blood, I hold the spear which pierced
his holy heart, longinus is my name!!!

Hellish strenght, grand-Goat war, antichrist,
from the pits of Hell!!!
Diabolic Force...Diabolic Force...Diabolic Force!!!
Rising high, grand Goat-war, we are possessed by his blood
BLOOOOOOODDDDDDD!!!
