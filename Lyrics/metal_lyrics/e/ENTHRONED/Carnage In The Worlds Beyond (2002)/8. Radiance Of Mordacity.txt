[music: N.Daemon/Nornagest, lyrics: Nornages]

Valorisation of hypocrisy
perpetuated by the glorious weakness
Tribulations from below
engendered by the wicked.

The revolution from our altars,
will be the fire towards the sky
Desecration of your believes,
for thousand years of tyrrany!!!

RADIANCE OF MORDACITY

[Lead: N.Daemon]

Hear my bestial mockeries
Profanantion of your secrets
For our thirst of sincerity
Fornication of the blessed whore
for the procreation of Blasphemies

RADIANCE OF MORDACITY
