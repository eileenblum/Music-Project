[music: N.Daemon/Nornagest, lyrics: Nornagest]

A shadow is walking by my side...holding a gun
Looking at me with somber eyes
Step by step caught in the ground
Each strides synchronised on me...every wills, every faces
The manifestations of my soul, materialized in black
No love, no compassion exist in our blackened heart.

Is there a place for affection in my being???
Hatred under will, massacre of mortality
The blood which taint my face
Is the evidence of our inhumanity
Ligaments of guts around the canon,
the proof of our dedication,
our father purification process.

Shoot!!By commandments from hell
Kill for pleasure, burn human leather
Explode!!Their chest...
We are the resorliers of life!!!

The blood which taint my face
Is the evidence of our inhumanity
Ligaments of guts around the canon,
the proof of our dedication,
our father purification process.

INFERNAL FLESH MASSACRE

Now that my body is trapped
Behind the walls of human justice...

[Lead: Nornagest]

The shadow is still there, as I look at it,
from the head `til my feet
the voice still whispering my name...
