[Lyrics: Nornagest / music: Phorgath]

From the venom of the Earth
to the king of the sky.
A mighty hunter before the Lord
whose spiritual deception of civilization
was frustrated by God,
consequently vilified as...
My divine vengeance!

Forsake me not, o Lord!
Cover the light of ignorance
and stab the world
Rise through me Ak-rab!

"Thou shalt go
upon the lion and adder
the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread
under thy feet"

Feed me, for I feed the flame!

Make haste to strengthen me
O Lord my salvation.

Forsake me not, o Lord!
Cover the light of ignorance
and stab the world
Rise through me Ak-rab!
