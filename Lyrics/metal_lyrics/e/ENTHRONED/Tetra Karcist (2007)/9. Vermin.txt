Relevant to the next level of pain
I'll behave myself proudly
as the disease I became!
Thoughout my flesh
My pestilence sweats from the poison I am!

Your divine touch
made me sick
a sickness oh so sweet!
O Lord of the North
Your punishment I accept
and become your chosen Vermin!
For a thousand years, grant me as your messenger
for thee I choose my life as a living scare.

Exorcise my hate, purify my love
purify my love, exorcise my hate.
Let the vermin come upon them
Who gnashed upon me with their own teeth!
For I am thy virus.
"Let thy will come unto me
So shall I have wherewith to answer him
that reproaches me
For I trust in thy word!"

O Lord of the North
Your punishment I accept and become your chosen Vermin!
For a thousand years, grant me as your messenger
for thee I choose my life as a living scare.
My deceiver
my God
from the North, South, East and West
