[Lyrics: Nornagest / music: Nornagest - Nguaroth]

Sanctvs Diaboli
Sanctvs Erus
Sanctvs Vestri Nomen...

Helmsman of the dim
Which bestows him the bread thou have not
Which feeds the follower on his grounds

My Lord, my patronizing,
I know your cogency,
namely: A help to the high arm!

Sanctvs Satani
Diabolvs Dominvs
Sanctvs Satani
Pater Cvstodiam

Sanctvs Satani
Veni Omnipotens
Sanctvs Satani
Aeterne Diabolvs

Father,
Thee who knows compassion,
Thou pay attention to our calls.
King,
Thou hold the power of my breed
I pay my honor to you
O rejected Son of the dawn...
We bleed for thee!

Sanctvs Satani
Diabolvs Dominvs
Sanctvs Satani
Pater Cvstodiam
