[Lyrics / music: Nornagest]

For my guardian trinity,
I raise up the truth, that bitter and hasty nations...

Terrible and dreadful: their judgement and their dignity
shall proceed of themselves.
Thou art of more pure eyes than to behold their thoughts,
and cannot look on iniquity o Lord!
Wherefore lookest thou upon them
... that deal treacherously.

Give ear, unto my prayer
Father, I have called upon thee (listen to me!)
Incline thine ear unto me!
Give ear, unto my prayer... My prayer!

Behold ye among the plebe:
for I will not work his task in your days.
Hold not thy joy when the wicked devoureth
the man that is more righteous... Righteous
... Righteous than he?

Give ear, unto my prayer
Father, I have called upon thee (listen to me!)
Incline thine ear unto me!
Give ear, unto my prayer... My prayer!
Granter of our flesh, Muse of our minds.
Granter of our lives, dominion of our decadence
O mighty Lord. O mighty Father
we pray to thee...
