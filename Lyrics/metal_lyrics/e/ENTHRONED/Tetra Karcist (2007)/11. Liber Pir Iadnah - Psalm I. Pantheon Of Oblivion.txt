[Bonus track]

[Lyrics / music: Nornagest - Nguaroth]

Kneel for me and praise the son of my sinful joy
You who sees things as hollow
The senses that even the blindeth cannot capture them completely.
You who only see and make a model of things...

Centuries have kept the secrets of men
in such way, the real truth behind them is to be seen.
Time has come for the serpent
to sneak out and devour...
Truth is just unknown and not forgotten.

"O ohorela taba Ol nore od pasbs
ol zonrensg Vaoan od tooat nonucafe gmicalzoma
Pilah Farzm znrza od surzas Adna od Gono de Satan,
ds hom od Toh..."

Revelation will rise in its time and will
Pending this moment of glory
peaceful without a thrill
I dwell within the realms of oblivion
in harmony with the Lord.

The choirs of the deeds accompany my solitude
through the lumps of truth,
chanting the glorious lampoons of chaos
... in harmony with my Lord.
