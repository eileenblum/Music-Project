[Lyrics: Nornagest / music: Nornagest - Phorgath]

Theology began
in an empty womb
Hidden to us by a lost Providence
And so the night became, mother of eternal life...
"In the beginning there was none but Chaos
Nothing but the Immortals
and the unexplainable worlds
Powers of utter consciousness revealed by the Oracle"

O immensity of the night sky
N.R.M.D.S.
Hearken the voice of The Light
C.F.N.N.

Nox!
The truth is unlocked
Counter Clockwise to an eternal fall
Mother!
Far away from the light
To the most inscrutable silence
Splitting the tasks with Erebus
Shall thou bring back the void in place
as when the empty space
was separated from the Earth and skies?
... but Present in between.
As it is meant to be...

O immensity of the night sky
N.R.M.D.S.
Hearken the voice of The Light
C.F.N.N.
Nox!
The truth is unlocked
Counter Clockwise to an eternal fall
Mother!
Far away from the light
To the most inscrutable silence
