In those insane, and yet familiar places, where death lies beckoning.
It is the unseen, of metaphysical nature, That pierces through, beneath the veil.

Rise - Eu Daimon

Face to face - with one and the many, the terrible truth of rememberance.
For the horned god, of infinite seed, Read into platonic verses.

Rise - Eu Daimon
