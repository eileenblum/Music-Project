Black, black as my mind.
I can't see the light, it's eluding me.
What can you say, when the feeling has gone.
When you're just like me, living in distress.
Black. Darkness inside.
What can you say when the feeling has gone7

Existence running out of sync.
Living out of your time.
Out of your time...

Never, you will never, will never get home,
(out of your time) Never...never get home...

Btack, black as my mind,
I can't see the light, it's eluding me
What can you say, when the feeling has gone.
When you're just like me, living in distress,
Black. Darkness inside.
I can't see the path, it's eluding me,
What can you say when the feeling has gone ?
