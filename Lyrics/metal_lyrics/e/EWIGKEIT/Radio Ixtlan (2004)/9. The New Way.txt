The time has come, to head the call. Days of darkness are abound.
We've lost our way somewhere in time, There's no compassion to be found.
I fear you're near me, but you don't hear me in cold and distant ways.
Dark surrounds with silent sounds, Tomorrow's debt paid for todays.

The only way...
I hear you calling, it's like a warning, I don't know who you really are.
I kept on dreaming an end is seeming not to be so far...
The only way...
...the time has come to head the call.
