When I heard ideas igniting in my head,
Thoughts of defraction and change,
My reaction to the crashing of this machine,
Was one of chaos - to disconnect the plug

Powerplant - give me the eye to see the other side.
The see the technicolours of my dreams.
Powerplant - give me the eye, give me the power
Give me the power of my dreams

Doors of perception ore banging in the wind.
echoing through the corridors of the mind.
Khock-knock - it's only me
(I'm coming around again)
Are you still working out the game?

Powerplant - give me the eye to see the other side.
The see the technicolours of my dreams.
Powerplant - give me the eye, give me the power

Give me the power of my dreams
Can you hear those doors Otazka
Are they mine or yours?
Can you hear those doors Otazka
The Door swings both ways!

...this is the end.
