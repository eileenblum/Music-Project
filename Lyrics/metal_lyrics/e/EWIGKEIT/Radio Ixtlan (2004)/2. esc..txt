it's a premature feeling, that the end is drawing nigh. Distraction from the truth that you're never'going to die.
Impending doom - not based in reality, but the darkness of your mind. A close shave with sanity (never going to die...)
Climbing the walls - there's no way out at all. A last action to take - Escape, escape, escape...
Paranoia has dug in deep, the last few days I've had no sleep. Seems like there's no hope to find - running through my mind...
Take a pill, think it through - the world goes on and so do you. There a world left to conquer, but its running through my mind...
Climbing the walls - there's no way out at all. A last action to take - Escape, escape, escape...
