When your last year seems like yesterday
And an end feels not too far away
Think of the things you know are true
That destiny holds a lot more time for you.

Fear can't keep you down.
Make your weakness your crown.
Conquer the fear within your mind
- take hold of your own destiny...

Keep up that hill, don't stray from your path.
Choose not to follow temptation's way.
Integrity's my pride - loneliness my bride.
The struggle never ends - day after day after day.

Fear can't keep you down.
Make your weakness your crown.
Conquer the fear within your mind
- take hold of your own destiny...

Conquer the fear - day after day.
Conquer the fear within your mind
- take hold of your own destiny...
