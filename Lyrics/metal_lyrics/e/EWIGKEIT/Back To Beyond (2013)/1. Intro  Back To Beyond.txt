"We're about to begin a journey through the cosmos. We'll encounter galaxies, suns, planets, life and consciousness coming into being, evolving and perishing. Worlds of ice and stars of diamond, atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms; it's a story about us... and what our fate may be..."

The night sky sings;

Solitude reigns, black sun risen again.
Dark night of the soul, no one to share my pain.

Back to beyond â back to where I belong.
Symmetry of passion and hatred, borne beneath these wings; the night sky sings.

Higher and higher and higher; mountains graze my feet.

You cannot save me now, destiny intrudes.
Summers are now gone, contentment eludes.

Falls are not so great when heaven's winds guide your way,
Tomorrow's eternal light, born in the darkness of today's... today.
