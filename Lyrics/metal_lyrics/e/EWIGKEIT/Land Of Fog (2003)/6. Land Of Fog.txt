Challenge the very essence of sanity,
By constantly shifting normality.
To you I am a clown dancing alone,
But I am a conductor of the stars

In the land of Fog, I am King.
The Lord of my own creations.
Will you pass the gatekeeper and come in,
To hear my inane proclamations?

Strip the truth bare, see it naked and cold.
See it in perspective to where you are.
"But remember the orbital transcendance illusion"
By the time you've seen me, I'm gone.

Forever passing to the land of Fog,
Shooting stars are the glints of my heels
There is thunder at the door waiting to come in,
I should go now to answer its call.

'Sky surfing stars in a sea of everness.
Their screeching breaks, echoing in the blackness.
They turn and gather, flying flends of hell.
Trying to trap you in their webs of doom!'
When stating destinations, the price must be paid.
To pass the test of time, through which the mind is decayed.

Caught now in my own shrunken world,
The transmission's broken down.
Danger sirens are echoing from within,
Only time will tell if I get back home.
The key to unlock insanity is hanging from the stars...
