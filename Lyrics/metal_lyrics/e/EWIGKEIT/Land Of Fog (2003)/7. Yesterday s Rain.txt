When the rain starts to fall, I feel at home.
No matter where I am, that's just the way it's meant to be.
My way of solitude, is second to none,
It's just the only way I remember.

Like drift-wood on the tide, I'm carried out.
Onto the sea, from thereâ¦ (who knows?)
As long as it keeps raining, I'm home and dry.
I float on into the depths of my mind...

Those melancholic feelings, so damp and dark.
To me are like a summer's cooling breeze.

Memories from a time of life,
That seems to me now, so far away.
Young and innocent, black with child eyes.
The way I used to see, it seemed so clear,
From here, everything's so unsure - everything so unsure...

Them years before my birth, they seem so much to me,
A nieve face looking into the sky.
And now that sky's uncast and un-clear,
And I'm so sure - like yesterdays rain.
