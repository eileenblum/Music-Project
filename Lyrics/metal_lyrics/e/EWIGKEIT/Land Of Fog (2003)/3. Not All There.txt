It's not up and not down, neither East nor West.
This feeling is all around me.
From here I see no stars for I am far, far away.
My mind is on another plain,
Just a blade of grass in an ocean of shields,
To tempt the wrists of Gods.

Have I become a thorn in the side of this holy ground I grew in,
Destined to go up in smoke and leave the rest in ruin.
This poor man's tale, of a mind now lost. I can't conceive what his sanity cost
Never to be seen again...

A voyage of contrition, through mad abolition,
I am the seed of angels tears.
Glistening on a bed of emerald green,
Waiting to be sown again &amp; again &amp; again...

A survivor of time, I'll show you the way.
Which many have lost, in the world today..

"While heaven wept, I held a cup to catch the falling tears.
And from this prison released my mind, held under all these years.
So on and on I've sown the seed, like chapters in a book.
And freed my dreams from constraint, to have a second look".

Have I become a thorn in the side of this Holy ground I grew in ?
Desined to go up in smoke and leave the rest in ruin.
This poor man's tale of a mind now lost, I can't concieve what his sanity cost.
Never to be seen again...

A voyage of contrition, through mad abolition,
I am the seed of angels tears.
Glistening on a bed of emerald green,
Waiting to be sown again &amp; again &amp; again...
