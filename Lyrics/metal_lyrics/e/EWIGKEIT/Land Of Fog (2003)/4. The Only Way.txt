The time has come, to heed the call.
Days of darkness are abound.
We've lost our way, somewhere in time,
There's no compassion to be found.

Lost in the dark years, an entity of light.
Breathing life to it's future, mankind's past holds the key.

Search through the pages of history,
Find that which is lost.
Find that which is lost!

An empty cask, an ark of souls.
An ocean of feelings lies within.
Release these auras, unto the world.
The flock shall learn the way...

Speeding through alien terrain,
All colours of the spectrum,
This flight of rapture enflames my soul.
The only way, the only way...
As the aeons pass, so we fade.
