In my head, distant thunder rolls on,
Blue thunder with distant hooves.
Cloud formations in my head,
Are looking set to burst anytime.

A satellite in time, drifting on the waves.
Eternally spinning round and round.
You can't find me, far away.
And your mind cannot say which way I am,
For I am gone...

"I'm drifting and spinning on the web of thought,
trying to anchor onto something of substance.
Now I am falling like an angel from grace,
but with a soul-felt emotion of being free..."

A paranoid fly on the wall,
I cannot be caught by mysterious webs.
At sundown I travel to the stars,
To gather my disciples at the sonic boom.

Gods of blue thunder, riding chariots of gold.
Super-sonic sound blast, heed one and all.
Sub-atomic lightening, it shatters your soul,
And it's echo resounds on and on and on and on...
