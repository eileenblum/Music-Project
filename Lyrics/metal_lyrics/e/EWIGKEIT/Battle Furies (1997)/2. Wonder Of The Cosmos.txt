As sleep takes my body and will, my true soul
wanders free.
To the stars and beyond...
Time I traverse with my soul to witness the
times before.
When will I see my future, or hear the
whispering tales of the stars.
All the times that I have wandered, I have
been free.
And yet bound by my conceptions of this
existence.
It is not for me to know the secrets of
the cosmos.
And yet, I wonder.
Beaten to concession I fall
Back to where I came, yet none the wiser
This is uor wonder of life, to think all and yet to
know nil
Shall rise like a phoenix from my ashes
Or shall I fade the essence of time
