Battle honour and victory shall be ours
To commemorate our dead
To banis their "evil" from this world
And recreate the pagan paradise that was
tramppled under-foot
The witches shall again become the wise,
in this our new land of the young
We, who contorl the storms. Our victory is
their demise
The "harmony" has broken and as
christendom falls
They will see the horror of that which they did
do unto us
We shall prevail

[J. Fogarty 8/1/96]
