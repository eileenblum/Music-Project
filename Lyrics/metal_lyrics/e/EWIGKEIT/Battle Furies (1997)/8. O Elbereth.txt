Rising into a blackened sky, an elven sword
held aloft
'o Elberth' I hear their cry, glamdring
cleaving orken flesh
The battle is high, give your light unto us
Orcrist foe of the dark smite those of
evil wrath
Casting spells, crafting nature's path, calling
your power
o Elberth queen of souls, elven runes hold
your power
o Elberth light in dark, grant me
enlightened visions
o Elberth
