I shall overcome this feeble world,
This place of the dying and the dead
The quest for eternity is at hand,
Tomorrow's end closer at every breath

"Overcome the fear within thee,
Knoe your place amidst the foolish
Elite are tou among the spirits of this world,
And your reward shall be ascension"

On into infinity, to the eye of immortality
Behold the power of perpetual dusk
Eradicate the sub-huan conscious,
To reveal a sky of shinig stars
Their frail light reveals the castness of their web
Seeming too remote to be so close to thy heart

Open your mouth to their music and hear the power
Which is the thunderous roar of the waves of life
Crashing on the cliffs of failure

On into the starscape- drift into destiny

[J. Fogarty 10.1.98]
