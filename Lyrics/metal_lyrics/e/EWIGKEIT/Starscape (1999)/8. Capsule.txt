No more waiting
The time has come,
For me to leave this mortal existence
My mind is cleared by visions of exalation
The silence of infinte space

Mechanised drifting,
An elegant movement
Never colliding,
Those great speheres of light

Mo more waiting,
My final deed is done
My soul is drifiting into space
Behold the rays of our sun,
Are but tears in the flood yet to come

"This I cannot comprehend,
my feelings, the ovwerwhelm my soul..."

So I come to face destiny,
My place among the stars
Mesmerised by blackness,
In my capsule of thought
I drift eternally...
