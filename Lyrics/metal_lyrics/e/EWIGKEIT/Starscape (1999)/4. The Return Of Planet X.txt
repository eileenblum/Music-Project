Take me to the twilight kingdoms,
In your inter-planetary craft
Give to me your wisdoms,
Of truths yet to be revealed
Sanctuary in the faceless landscape,
A vacuum of emotional content

Your dark eyes of sleeping discontent,
Revealing to me the horrors foreboding
Flee my loved ones to your heavens,
To perpetuate your brothers of man
You shall guide my heart when the time is come...

Hope from the heavens, gods manifest,
Must I wait till the end,
While I alredy know the way?
Tenth planet, nameless and black,
Home of gods, my salvation...

My salavation...
