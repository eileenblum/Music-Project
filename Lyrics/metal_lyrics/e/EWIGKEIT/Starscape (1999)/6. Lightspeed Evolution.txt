An atom of prior insignificance,
Pulses with devastating potential
To be more than this mortal coil,
To devide time and space

Atomic diffusion!
The blinding of eyes that see into the heavens
Incineration of the macrocosm

The life spreads out, as the death unfolds
The heavens erupt an earthly hell
Old gives way to the new, the one remaining law
The microcosm envelops all

Bear witness to the miracle,
That shakes the earth's foundations
Lightspeed evolution
A man-made god
