Eternal prism, dividing light, time trap of the stars
Deriving all power from the will of the great architect
Supreme being, shifter of light,
Dwelling in void-less space
Bound only by his own imagination

"The shape-shifting disruption of time
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence"

How I dwell upon the immensity,
To find the truth before I die
When my time has gone,
And the world no-longer mine,
I shall rise beyond death,
Up to the ether to live as a god among gods
A new level to descover

"Souls drifting disruption time
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence"

From whence I came. I know not
But I have decovered this;

"Souls drifting disruption time
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence"

That by analysis of one's own soul
It can be learnt how to achieve eternal life
To once again return to the forlorn heavens
Back to the point of origin

"Souls drifting disruption time
Incomprehensible puzzle of existence"

[J. Fogarty 22.9.97]
