Heed conspirators! Hear my call!
The abyss is waiting for you all.
The truth is in demand...

Smoke and mirrors hide the lies
It's time to tear down the thin disguise
What you find there. You'll not believe

Theory or reality.
The truth or the lie.
Which ever path you choose to take.
Be sure the reason why

A time is coming. When we will see
Behind your veil of reality.
Don't change your shape now.
Stay in the shadows!

Point the finger, deflect the blame
You have the power, but we'll die the same.
Your one-eyed god-he watches you...

Theory or reality.
The truth or the lie.
Which ever path you choose to take.
Be sure the reason why
