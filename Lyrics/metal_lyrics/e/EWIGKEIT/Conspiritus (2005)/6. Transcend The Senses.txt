There is an indefinable mysterious power that pervades everything.
I feel it through I do not see it.
It is this unseen pwer which makes itself felt, and yet defies all proof.
It is so unlike all that I percieve through my senses:
It transcends the senses...

People do not know who rules or why and how he rules.
And yet they know that there is unseen power that certainly rules.
I feel it, though I do not see it.
It is so unlike all that I percieve through my senses:
It transcends the senses...

In the midst of death, life persists.
In the midst of untruth, truth persists.
In the midst of darkness, light persists.
Truth persists, light persists.
I feel it, though I do not see it.
It is so unlike all that I percieve through my senses:
It transcends the senses...

It transcends the senses.
