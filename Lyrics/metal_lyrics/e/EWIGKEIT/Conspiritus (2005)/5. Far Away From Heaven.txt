Imagine there's no heaven, just open your eyes.
A distortion of reality, war-torn reddened skies.
Values are shifting, to the left and to the right.
Is it paranoia, or is the end in sight?

Far away from heaven, what is this place I see before my eyes?
Far away from heaven, conspiracy's a great disguise.

The past keeps repeating, or so I heard today.
When black becomes white, it's time to turn away.
Truth is distorted, the lies within your mind.
It's time to open eyes, because the blind lead the blind (lead the blind) ....

Far away from heaven, what is this place I see before my eyes?
Far away from heaven, conspiracy's a great disguise.

Where is the truth? Far away...
Where is the life? Far away...
Where is the meaning? Far away...
Where is the justice? Far away...
Where is the love? Far away...
Where is the joy? Far away...
Where is the peace? Far away...
Where is reality? Far away...
Where is the good? Far away...
Where is the light? Far away...
Where is the sanity? Far away...
Where is the freedom? Far away...
Where is the reason? Far away...
Where is heaven? Far away...
Where is heaven? Far away...
Where is heaven? Far away...
