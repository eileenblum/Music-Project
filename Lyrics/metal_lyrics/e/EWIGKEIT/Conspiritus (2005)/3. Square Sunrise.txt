Everything exists the moment you think of it,
And nothing does the moment you forget.
Looking through the holes of your tattered sanity,
When you see the end, there's nothing to regret.
Time to realize - See the square sun-rise.
Sometimes it feels like you're waiting for something,
Something that shows you the way to go.
Deep in this shelter, waiting for 'impact',
When will it fall - nobody knows.
Time to realize - See the square sun-rise.
Now I see it coming, there is no escaping.
Trying to discover, then running for cover.
The whole world is changing, prison of our making.
My mind feels like breaking, freedom's for the taking.

See the square sun-rise.
