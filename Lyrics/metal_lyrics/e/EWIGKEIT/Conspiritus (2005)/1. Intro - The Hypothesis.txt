Let us suppose for a moment that the world is not quite as it seems.

Let us suppose that all society is controlled surreptitiously by covert, rather than overt dictatorship, all modern wars, disease and famines are manufactured to happen and that the true meaning of our life here on earth hidden from us by the "illuminated" elite and their tentacles of media, banking, religion, politics, mis-education and centuries of lies.

Let us suppose that there are fundamentalist, paranoid and merciless governments that would willingly attack their own people under the guise of terrorist attacks (employing the Hegelian Principle - or - thesis.anti-thesis.synthesis). Through mass-media manipulation and censorship these conspirators are then able to convince the rest of the world that we need to follow their utopian vision and establish a "new world order".

Let us then imagine how the realisation of this hypothetical truth would affect us mentally, emotionally and spiritually?
