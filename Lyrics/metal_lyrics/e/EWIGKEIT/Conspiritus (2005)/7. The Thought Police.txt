The Thought Police are watching you, they listen to your calls.
They're controlling your mind.
Chained by debt and the T.V set - they're coming through the walls!
I won't break!.....

And I know it seems the truth is far away from you,
And it's hard to know what's real.
But their house of cards is falling now, there's nothing they can do.
And what's true is what you feel.

A wise man once said "ignorance is bliss"
Ain't that the fucking truth?
I'm starting to believe in "paranoid psychosis"
I won't break!....

And I know it seems the truth is far away from you,
And it's hard to know what's real.
But their house of cards is falling now, there's nothing they can do.
And what's true is what you feel.
