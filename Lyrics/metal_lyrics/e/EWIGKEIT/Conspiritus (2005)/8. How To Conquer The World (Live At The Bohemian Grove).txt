Manufacture consent right from the start
To get this global governing down to an art.
Kill those who oppose and see through your lies
Fund corrupt politicians for a disguise.
Brainwash the masses through media control
Tear down religion and belief in the soul.

Destroy education to remove any threat
Indenture the workers in un-payable debt
Create your opponent in a neighbouring land
Attack your own people with the hidden hand.
Fund both sides in a global war
Arm them to the teeth so you can settle the score.

When peace breaks out, the hit them again
Remember they are cattle and we're better than them.
Create killer disease and withold the cure
It won't affect us because we keep our blood pure
The time is at hand to remove your disguise
You've conquered the world - the ultimate prize.
