Inside the nightmare institution,
For your sins, no absolution.
Better draw up a constitution,
And start to free your mind...

Truth is lies, and white is black,
Sometimes the way through's going back.
In reverse on the wrong track,
Their heaven is my hell...

Walls are built with bloodied hands,
History lies beneath the sands.
Don't give in to their demands,
They'll take it all away...

When you can't find a way,
Then perhaps it's time to pray.
But if god is your all,
The he won't return the call...
