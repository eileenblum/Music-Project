Trend of events
Is logical
Horror and death
Blood and regret!
He takes their souls,
Their bodies are on fire!!!

Burn them - they will die and they'll regret
Burn them - I want see the great spectacle
Burn them - they will die until sunset
Burn them - I want see the great spectacle

They stand on helish ways
They leave the peaceful place
They have not any names
They will burn in hell.

Give me power, give me glory
And I will tell you all the story
Deadly faces, totting corpses
Bloody eyes, burning fields.

Give me the axe, give me the sword
Then I will kill them and I will Devour
