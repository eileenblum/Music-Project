Fast explosion of the war
Evil against the angels
Brutal murders and so on
Fast explosion of the war.

Pulsing eyes, rotting brains, 
Angels die, he blind them.
Ugly faces, pungent stench
Broken hands, violence.

Fast explosions of the war
Evil against the angels
Brutal murders and so on...
Fast explosion of the war.

Soldier of the dark will come
Depending on the dark and fire
Now, he appears from nowhere
And he will kill the angels there
Soldier of the dark will come
Depending on the dark
The revenge of the demon is coming
And he will rape the angels there
I will tell this evil story
It's about the angel's death
He drink their blood from their veins
He eat their hands with their fingers
Angels return to the sky
And now they cry, then they die
The revenge of the demon is coming 
And he will rape the angels there
Now I tell so evil story
It's about the angel's death.

Cruel Faces
Bloody corpses
Evil eyes
It's so nice.
