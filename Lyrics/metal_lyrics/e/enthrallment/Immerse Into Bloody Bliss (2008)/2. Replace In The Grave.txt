Somebodyâs walking in the Cemetery,

Pulling feeble female and walking drunk, unsuspected,

Some one disturb the sleep of other.
Replace in the grave, Replace in the grave,â¦
Step by step, he is coming to my grave.

He tried to banging me.

I grasp girlâs leg in the Dark,

Before the abductor trow a glance at me. 
Sign of drunkenness-expiate.

Sign of the quilt-cruelty.

Sign of sadism is fist-law.
Murdered.

Drown in the Grave.

Burying for Eternity.

And took the girl.

Her blood is for me.

Iâll keep the corpseâ¦weakling. 
Step by step, he is coming to my grave.

He tried to banging me.

Animal instincts will burn again,

The earth tease my rotten flesh. 
Replace in the grave, Replace in the grave,â¦
