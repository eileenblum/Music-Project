Cane the messiah with the crook,
Cane the messiah with the crook,

Cane the messiah with the crook,

Cane the messiah with the crook!
Ask him for the truth, heâll never tell it.
To trust him is a mistake. Hypocrite!

He is not your savior, just an impositor,
And insolent coward. Punish him! 
Cane the messiah with the crook!

Cane the messiah with the crook!

You are part of an everlasting circle,
Manipulated by some liars.

Take the crook from his hands!

His effords to protectâ¦are funnyâ¦
His spine must be pounded into dust.
The ribsâ¦,tooâ¦Break his limbs!

He has to be a molluskâ¦,what he really is,
Not just a spinelessâ¦creature.
