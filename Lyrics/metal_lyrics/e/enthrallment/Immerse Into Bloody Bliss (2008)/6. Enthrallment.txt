For those who think the world is heaven.
For those who think the life is a gift of god.
For those who hopeâ¦who pray

And virgins that stay awayâ¦
Enthrallmentâ¦
Away from us your haevenâs burning!

Your god is low creatures. Useless!
Virgins Iâll find you, Iâll possess you!
Alive or dead!

Enthrallmentâ¦
Your heaven is turn to âBurning Fieldsâ.
The scarlet has no difference already.
Your brain is part of my collection.
Immerse into bloody bliss!
