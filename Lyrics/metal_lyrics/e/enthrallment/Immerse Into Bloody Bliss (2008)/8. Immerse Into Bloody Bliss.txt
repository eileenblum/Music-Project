A few tortured females,

Are laying down, obsessed by killing fear.
The hope for end of suffering

Make them to be a thorough.
I smell their blood, their appetizing wounds,
My tools, my acts of violenceâ¦

Make their bodies bleed.

I drink their vaginal and anal bloody fluids.
I feel the pleasure

To enjoy their sexual acts.

Make them do it

By force!
Furious kicks before,

Sadistic penetration.

I adore the heap,

Of their naked, spent bodies.
Forget about the world around you!

Iâm involved with that mixture,

Of naked, spent bodies.

Iâm immerse into bloody bliss. 
Immerse into bloody bliss!

Immerse into bloody bliss!

Immerse into bloody bliss!

Immerse into bloody bliss!
