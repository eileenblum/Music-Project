Your decrepit body,

Will die slowly and hard,

Reeking of decay,

Squilling like a pig.
You are starting process of rotting.
Warms will take a good care for you!
Your thoughts enjoy another heads,
Youâre already dead.

Tones of badmoonâre fulling your head.

Intellectual death.
Defalcate supremacy. Iâm those revive the despite.
Diabolic power. I love my realm of freaks.
Porkers, corpses the warms and rats.
My realm is divine.
So,I adore only young flesh.

The rising generation is next.

Break and grind every bone.
