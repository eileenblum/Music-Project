Away from our territory covered with bones,
Weâre waiting for you at the right place.
Your meat is building our bodies.

We smellâ¦ weâre looking for you!

Our tools are prepared for human meat.

I want to hear your scream before you die!
Youâre so easy to hunt down.

Weâre following you â donât turn back!
Weâll make your blood runs cold.

We can see you through my eyes.
Youâre tired up and I look around so pleased.
The flames are roasting parts of you.

Cut and dismembered bodies,

Ate laying at my legs.
The fire is touching me.

I have the skull.

I hold the evil power.

The blood supports every vulgar ritual.
