Why is
He everywhere, the faceless man in tears?
His screaming flesh awaiting the eternal night
The night when all mortals lose
Their borrowed souls facing the brightâ¦

â¦ void
Last swing by cut off wings
To embrace my urge to breathe
There will be or maybe not...
There will be no next dawn
The seas flood the mountains
With their lifeless poisoned waters
When I speak these words
Soaked in hopelessness,
I suffocate
Empty world around me
Covered in nothingness
I'm blinded by a fit of scare
From all I thought that existed
My screams are exiled to lie in books
Written in branded words
An image sealed within colourful portraits
Lunacy painted with swords
The hate slaughtering my mind
I despise
The scorn that's turning into fear
I hate
I don't regret
I'm dying
Since death shall free me
From all of you
But the incurable disorder obsessing my immortality
Remains locked solely in the imagination of a madman
I won't return to tell no more
For I've found the dreadful reality...
I was never ever born
Empty world around me
Covered in nothingness
I'm blinded by a fit of scare
Enslaved by my own seed...
