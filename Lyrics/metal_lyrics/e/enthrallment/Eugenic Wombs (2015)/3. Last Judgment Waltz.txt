Crowds of slaves more numerous than all the cavalry of
Antichrist's apologists
Praying hands outstretched like dry branches
Exalted crowds began singing in chorus a rapturous song
Adulation for the merciless echoing in mournful screams

[Solo: Andrey Gegov]

Savage howl from a bloodthirsty mouth
Final strike with a sinister sword
Instead on the ground,
The reptile armies crawl on sticky mucus of half dead bodies
No holes are deep enough to bury my grief
No walls are high enough to hide your deceits
A pale face looks down at me, a freak on the great throne of darkness
Some strange force he used against me, a force unknown to humans
Finally, it's time to finish the tragic plan
The evil's order lurking through the centuries has come
The descendants of all wicked exiles from the planets of black shine
Chained my advices as screams etched within the crags
Mass castration for all who know the truth
Mortals, I beseech you...
Burn the nest of this self-bred vermin
Adulation for the merciless...
All of us died in mournful screams
