The Possessor of lives is standing somewhere in nowhere
Under a veil of interlaced transparent figures
Free and harmless...
All eager to dive in the mud called earthly life
And ready to provide their purity for sacrifice

He who holds their lives moved his tallow body forms
And thundered with divine voice, "Why do you want to incarnate?"
"I want to perceive forgiveness"
"But how? You are not programed to sin or do anything wrong"
"Don't cry, I'll teach you to forgive us", spoke another voice
"We'll punish you after we incarnate, then you will forgive us"

Flesh and blood filled the spirits
Becoming people they met with evil
Forgot about the deal and who they were
And took their earthly form too seriously
They began to brawl and hate each other
Anger seized their souls
And incurable evil possessed their minds
As they furiously rode their doom
They played their roles so cruelly that they would never ever again
Be a part of that pure, homogeneous spiritual essence they once were

Flesh and blood filled the spirits
Becoming people they met with evil
Forgot about the deal and who they were
And incurable evil possessed their minds
