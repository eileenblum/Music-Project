Even before the elements of air combined
And the fire wasn't planned to harm the species
The galaxies were a foetus inside an infinite womb
And the counting of horrid repeats had begun
Told through glorious tales
A mythic landscape is painted by swords
But from the forbidden fruit
Evil's new allies are hatching too
Deceptive human idols
Appearance beautiful, but bespattered by the wicked
The rise of such monstrous kingdom
I didn't suspect at all
I kept the seeds of mankind close to the nest of evil
Spawned before all the elements
My pure intention
Has turned to sickness
Scavengers are born from my flesh
Why did you ripped it then?
My black thoughts will never be sealed
Within the mental grave of deserved fears
My guilt cries despondently
An urge just to breatheâ¦
Beheaded hopes turn to failure
Inferno blows all unearthly light
The servants of the new kingdom
Force each goodness to die
Righteous unbelievers baptized through mutations
Different than their own heredity
Interference in the human population
Imprisoned inside eugenic wombs
My black thoughts will never be sealed
Within the mental grave of deserved fears
My guilt cries despondently
An urge just to breatheâ¦

[Solo: Nikola Ognyanov]

Told through gloriously tales
A mythic landscape is painted by swords
But from the forbidden fruit
Evil's new allies are hatching too
Deceptive human idols
Appearance beautiful, but bespattered by the wicked
The rise of such monstrous kingdom
I didn't suspect at all
Still
I remain eternally in the empty space
So dark but delightful for my final place
And to all who do not hear,
I pray..
And scream these words with pure hate...
