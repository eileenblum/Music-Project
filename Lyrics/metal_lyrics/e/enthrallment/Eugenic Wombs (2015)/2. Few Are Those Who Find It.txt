Exilic minds for centuries
In a virtual dungeon of souls
Crystal cages control the sanity
The past is locked behind invisible doors
Allowed to wander everywhere as ghosts
My dried remains are already free
Severe punishment is what I see
A stronger evil has conquered hell
Death after suffering...
The blood on all levels of insanity is so real
Cowards and their true identity
In morbid panic not to be revealed
I crashed on the walls of my knowledge
Hard as stone and scattered like dust.
From high above
I saw my memories there
And my past fled beyond the invisible doors
Narrow is the path that leads to my words
And few are those who find it
Wide is the road and huge are the gates
To the temples of sick imagination
Kingdom of cowards is pouring darkness
Upon your already dark world
Fellow humans attend the convicts
From time to time to take their blood
Faceless monsters hold your souls
With thunder they fry your brains
Clones vomit fire upon the cage
That hides your thoughts obscured

[Solo: Vasil Furnigov]

Death after suffering...
The blood on all levels of insanity is so real
Cowards with wicked minds
In morbid panic not to be reviled...
