The long-expected light
Is comming to heal the soul enraged
And draw it out of the cursed lake
The lake of thousand spineless creatures
Dwelling at the bottom
Unable to get out
Or change their miserable existence

Their tentacles are gripping my soul
Trying to keep it, trying to fail it
Their small eyes are unable to see
Unable to see the shining light
The light of inspiration vomits pulverizing energy
Upon the speechless figures shocked by the cold

Their twisted figures are deeply rooted down there
Staring through the dark you can see their maggot life
And their hollow universe full of horror and silence
Bred by the hysteria of their utter unimportance
Isolated, blocked, pulverized, self-destructed organisms
Torn to peaces useless parasites
Each screaming from its own hell
Rewarded to watch forever
The wild mocking dance of insanity

[Solo: Nikola Ognyanov]

[Solo: Vasil Furnigov]

A storm caused by themselves
A cold bringing them to their hell
A hell isolating them all
Turning them into derisive and paltry squits
Locked inside their new cocoon they shout
But all sounds are lost within their hell
Unable to get out, bespattered by
The soul of this inspired lunatic
