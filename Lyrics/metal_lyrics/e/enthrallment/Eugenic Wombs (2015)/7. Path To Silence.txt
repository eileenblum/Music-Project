Creeping ghost on an infinite path
Telling stories with plaintive cries
Silent steps echo hollowly
I realised the joy of life does not exist
Terrifying mirages from my past
Walking with my shadow hand in hand
Could be theyâre whispering by chance to me
âDo not escape the trap of human flesh?â
Silence at last
Burned are the roads to my nest
Path to silence
Fear of the delusive calm
I found myself imprisoned
In cycles of slavery and bloodshed
Fierce sparks are flying endlessly
Infernal tears from the eyes of freaks
Flashing in the mirror of centuries
The infernal tears blur my clear thoughts
But the small stars are an invincible weapon
And they lead my wisdom from life to life
It all begins at the very start
Where life rises as a stream and turns into a river
Deep wisdomâ¦ sad end.
Iâm writing a book about the beautiful flowers
Touched by the hands outstretched for life
But a flock of vultures darkened the sky
And I found a shade under their horrid wings
My weary soul takes a breathâ¦
Iâm not eatenâ¦
Stabbed, bleeding and emaciated
Iâm heading for the holy peaksâ¦

Miscreated repeats...
Nature takes their form
Cloned populations enslave themselves
The cages are open
But thoughts are flying ahead
To the temples of sick imagination
Despondent world of human wrecks
Buried under blue skies
From the mirror of my existence
Rotten sadness is kissing me with poison lips
