I fly through a universe of great sadness
Tied to the darkness of vice
Sadistic pleasures blind the generations
No place for me down with the filthy kind

[Solo: Nikola Ognyanov]

Invisible they come and mighty they stride
Hostile hordes from the planets drowned in black shine
Darkness is the path where they come from
To keep all human souls in depravity
Ethnic abuse with the homogeneous
Primal conspiracy leading to delusion
Enthroned by all blasphemous faiths
With so many names,
I stayed far away

[Solo: Nikola Ognyanov]

Youâre not the first to whom I serve
Iâm not the last that youâll betray
A glimmer of hope in this cave of pain
A belief become the chopper of my innocent dreams
Righteous unbelievers fight for the guts of my remains
Scattered and dragged by these same perverts
An image sealed within colourful portraits
Licked by the tongues of bloodthirsty mouths

[Solo: Nikola Ognyanov]

Invisible they come and mighty they stride
Hostile hordes from the planets drowned in black shine
Darkness is the path where they come from
To keep all human souls in depravity
I fly through a universe of great sadness
Tied to the darkness of vice
Sadistic pleasures blind the generations
No place for me down with the filthy kind
