Moan Of The Mob,
Smoke On The Moatâ¦
Devoid Of Everything Forever.

Sables And Plaque-Deadly Pleasure.
Real Hell On The Earth!
Sables And Leprosyâ¦Haunting Ghostâ¦
There Is No Way,
They Need The Maceâ¦
Thatâs What They Wait.
Why Itâs Lordâs?
Lord Of The Depths-Master Of Dead.
The Lord Is Coming From The Meat.
His Mace Will Blow The Mob.

Lord Enjoys The Victory Of Evil.

He Leads His Freaks

Between The Bones And Meat.

They Fall Upon The Corpsesâ¦
No Escape,
Total Devouring!

When All Is Done-Who Is The One!?
