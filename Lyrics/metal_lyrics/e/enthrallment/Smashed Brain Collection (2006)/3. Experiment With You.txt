Broken Bones,
Maggoty Meat.
Scattered And Stinking Bowels.

Exhume And Desecrate,

Torture And Deform!

Cruel Mental Experiment

Scorching Heat And Gore.

Ground Skeletonsâ¦
Only Dust And Stones.
Onward To The âExitâ!
But Itâs An Illusion.
One Thousant Mirrors Around And Sepulchralâ¦
Back Off!
Stay AwayFrom Me And Back Off!

Warningâ¦One Grunting Figure Is Coming!
Murder,
Wounds,
Abscess And Fracture.
Corrosion And Erosion,
Rot Of your Emotionsâ¦
Devotion And Commotiomâ¦Experiment With You.
Terminated Bodies,
Blood Skin Bones-Donât Brail!
Executed Bodies In Your (Mind) Territory
