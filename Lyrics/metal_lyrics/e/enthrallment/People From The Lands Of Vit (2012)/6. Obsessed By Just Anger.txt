[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Vasil]

Before I learned to hate

A hot storm of everlasting scorn burnt me
When I had the greatest need to confide in you
I revealed an unexpected conspiracy.
My memories did not spare me
The lies are striving to eat the truth.
When I had the greatest need to confide in you
I revealed an unexpected conspiracy.
I would like to throw out the gloomy thoughts that twist and spoil my soul.
The strongest weapon is the anger
Buried deep down in my mind

Its exhumed repulsive power

Shall forever hunt through me.
And if my victims should have a face
My religion would not be obsessed by just anger.
The strongest weapon is the anger
Buried deep down in my mind

Its exhumed repulsive power

Shall forever hunt through me.
