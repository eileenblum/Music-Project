[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Vasil]

Staring through your scared eyes

The blood rushes to your face

After that you turn pale

As pale as death.
See the dying freaks

Coming from the dusk

Many freaks are crawling slowly

They are everywhere.
The nearest to me

Is speaking

Unintelligible

I smell its rotten nature.

[Solo: Vasil]

All the rest are attacking me with their infected prongs.
I put on my gloves

But I pricked my finger tips

I felt the viscous blood

Of someone else.
See the dying freaks

Coming from the dusk

Many freaks are crawling slowly

They are everywhere.
