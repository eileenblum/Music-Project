[Music: Ivo &amp; Plamen / Lyrics: Plamen &amp; Vasil]

The treacherous snake of your religions
Slowly and surely strangles the mass of fools
Hypnotized by the greedy dark in her eyes
Deceived and blinded
Her Hypocrisy is the food for me
And I got used to its futility

And I can not and I will not

Feel her flesh upon mine!
The snake created by few

To manipulate the ignorant and favour just the âblessedâ!

[Solo: Vasil]

Screams fill the darkness

Iâve seen the face of your butcher
Violent horror is growing in your eyes
As the riot of insanity gets out of control.
The treacherous snake of your religions,
Slowly and surely strangles the mass of fools
Obsessed by the greedy dark in her eyes
Wretched flock
