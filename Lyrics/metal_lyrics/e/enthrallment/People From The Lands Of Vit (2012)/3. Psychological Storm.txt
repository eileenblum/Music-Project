[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Plamen]

I will never rest till my adrenalin is raving
Thirst for justice is growing and destoying my mind
Every voice inside my head whispers on and on
Just take a look behind the wall that stops me to
Free myself from their advices
Voices manipulating me

A wall built up by lies

Storm, psychological

[Solo: Andrey ]

Vortex formed by poured out thoughts
Stimulated by sweet psychosis

Fall into the arms of spree and rehab
All doomed to failure watching me regenerate
Voices coming out of my head, need somebodyâs help
Visiting another mind, manically keeping the cycle Finding their new place
Colonizing, planting internal suffering
Bestowing me my memories

Iâm enjoying the spectacle that has just begunâ¦
