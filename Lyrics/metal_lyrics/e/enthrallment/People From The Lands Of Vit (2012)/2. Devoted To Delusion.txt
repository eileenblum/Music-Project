[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Vasil]

Two lives entwined in one entity

Forced to share one only hope

Devoted to delusion

But the sanity of one will soon be backâ¦
The enemies are hiding in the shadows

In a new and unknown form

Penetrating the souls through the power of deceitful words
To never be free but left alone in oppressive void
Two lives entwined in one entity

Forced to share one only hope

Devoted to delusion

But the sanity of one will soon be backâ¦
Confusion is dwelling in your body
Horrifying creations torment every thought
With repulsive grinning human faces

They preach against the will to live.
If itâs only a dream,

Then what are these tears for?

What are these tears for?

What are these tears for?
Two lives entwined in one entity

Forced to share one only hope

Devoted to delusion

But the sanity of one will soon be backâ¦
