[Music &amp; Lyrics-Vasil]

Gone out souls to be born again
Creatures begot in this beautiful moment
Somewhere in the tears beyond the magic light
You will find the immortality of life

Let me stay here a little more
To draw a picture called "Neglected Love"

[Solo: Andrey]

I hear the sorrow cry of flies' mÐ¾thers every day

The poor fruits of pain and blue sky
Despondency and grief are daubing the rainbow
A rainbow in dark range of colors
You are standing by a river

But its water burning all of you
With flames of heaven's fire
Your devotion to pain shines
Let me stay here a little more

To draw a picture called "Neglected Love"

[Solo: Vasil]

Gone out souls to be born again
Creatures begot in this beautiful moment
Somewhere in the tears beyond the magic light
You will find the immortality of life

[Solo: Andrey ]
