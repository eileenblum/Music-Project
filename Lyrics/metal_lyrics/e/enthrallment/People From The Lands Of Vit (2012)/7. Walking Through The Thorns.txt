[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Plamen &amp; Vasil]

Walking through the thorns

Weâre doomed to saber and go on

Bleeding and mentally deranged

Exposed to cruelty forever.

[Solo: Vasil]

Summon the most disturbed

The path from the thorns to silence

It is in his eyes

There is our flight in the fiery rain.

[Solo: Andrey, Vasil]

The glory of holy baptism is beheaded

Hypocrisy is the butcher

If you can not help us out

Better stay away

You can not choose when youâll be born

But you can choose when to die.
Walking through the thorns

Weâre doomed to saber and go on

Bleeding and mentally deranged

Exposed to cruelty forever.
