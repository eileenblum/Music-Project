[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Vasil]

Creeping light, rotting silence

Just a reflection in each next existenceâs mirror
Nothing bothers the mind no more

Welcome children to create a new world

[Solo: Vasil]

My soul is trying to fly away so free

But the emptiness is pressing me down
Creeping light, rotting silence

Just a reflection in each next existenceâs mirror
Nothing bothers the mind no more

Welcome children to create a new world
I appeal to all present in my dreams

As ghosts that bring the sorrow

Overstep the sanity and invade my life

Stronger than devastation
Let them come with me

To feel the pain and observe the hate

The old raven is flying from the mountain of lost faith
Telling me my time has come

Iâm falling down with frozen smile
And broken wings.
