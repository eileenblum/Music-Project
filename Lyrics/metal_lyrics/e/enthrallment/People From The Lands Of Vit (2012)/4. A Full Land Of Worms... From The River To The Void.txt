[Music: Ivo / Lyrics: Plamen &amp; Vasil]

You think you're watching an ugly face
No name, no choice but joyful calm
Looking for the holy voice...

Ð land of no way out

A land full of worms

A land full of worms
In my short period of time
Painful thoughts lead my acts

The soul hates its home
Everlasting torture upon my world
Wherever I take a look round

I always see you squirming worms
Your insane eyes stare at me

I hope the river will help us out...

[Solo: Andrey]

The river is our joyful calm
Drowning and carrying us off to the void
Looking for the holy voice...

A land of no way out

A land full of worms

A land full of worms
