A young lad
With the force in his hand
Ordered to kill

Put him down
Execute the prisoner
Steel against skin

Exploitation and starvation
Unnatural extinction
Explosives and ammunition
Intellectual stagnation
Destruction is an ambition
The goal is annihilation
Death is rather a salvation 
Beside life in this damnation


Mercilessly eradicating nations
Savoring the bloodshed
Humanitys incineration 
An earth sweeping tidal wave
The green current flows red

Serve and you shall live
Obey or you'll be killed
Your will shall be done
Behest be filled

Lords of war.
greed and power
Monarchs of gore,
anguish and slaughter

The virulent militants are praised
Knights around the table of

Pestilence and decay
The deprived are enslaved
Treated like a pile
Of disgusting fecal waste

Inadequate lust to rule them all
By the glitter of gold enthralled
The independent breed will fall
Trap them all
Chain - them - all!

Seeing pain 
Makes them smile
With their lidless
Demon eyes

No compassion 
Bathed in blood
False justice
Playing god 

Belligerent supremacy
Armed diplomacy
Belligerent supremacy
Absolute entropy 

An Old man
Nothing in his eyes
Memories stuck in his mind

Time to erase the history
Steel against skin

Belligerent supremacy
Forced democracy
Belligerent supremacy
Creators of atrocities
