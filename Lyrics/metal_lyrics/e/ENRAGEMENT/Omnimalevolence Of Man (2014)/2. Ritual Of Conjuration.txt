Time is right, stars aligned
Lightâs era ends, darkness descends

Lured, trapped,
drugged with venom
she no longer resists

Empty stare
Dead gaze perceives
nothing but pain

Coerced, bound
To the altar
Ritual offering
Black candles
Flames of the abyss
They burn!

Astral Possession
A vessel for the 
Evil spirit
In trance, spellbound
By foul magic
Cast to conjure the restless essence

Witches of the ancient
Take this soul
May the excretions of life
Moist this unblessed soil

Witches of the ancient
Heed my call
May the messengers of light
Scorch in condemnation

The priest
Comes forth
He speaks
In the language of the dead
The flesh is decorated
With marks of summoning
Smear the blood on her! 

Effigies of this chaotic origin
Reflect to the red sky
When the dawn turns to dusk
Never shall it rise again!

Malevolence inhabits
The once disgraced body
Of a person whose mind
Was made to obey
The will of its master

Awake!
The queen of decay
Contaminate and
Grant us your
Undivine powers

Horrid!
Limbs twisted, pale skin
Veins pitch black
The mouth
Covered in needle sharp teeth

Dreadful!
The harlot rises
Eyes white blind 
And in
Agony
She screams

No longer human,
hovering above the altar
the abomination speaks
With an unearthly voice
she commands

Witches of the ancient
Take this soul
May the excretions of life
Moist this unblessed soil

Witches of the ancient
Heed my call
May the messengers of light
Scorch in condemnation
