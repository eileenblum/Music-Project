Deep within the forest
the sunâs last warm rays
caress those in unrest
through the cold haze

As frigid as the mist
are the decomposing carcasses
Frozen by rigor mortis
Posing like athletes of antiquity

Still lively although deceased
Marble white skin, limbs like hardened clay
Absent breath, absent heartbeat
Reeking of decay, displaying the dismay

Serving a feast for scavengers
the garden draws in hungry four-legged guests
to feed on the putrid cadavers,
to treat themselves in a gory excess

As did the dead when still alive
Forcing the Earth to scream in despair
Forging nature to please their minds
Gorging on the fruit it used to bear

Another statue is erected
by the gardener, the artist
Another effigy dissected,
in honor of Gaia and Artemis

Deep within the forest
the dark of the night grows black
concealing the cadaver garden
Tomorrow the sculptor will come back
