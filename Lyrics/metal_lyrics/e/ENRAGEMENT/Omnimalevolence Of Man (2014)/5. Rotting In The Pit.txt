You open your eyes but see nothing
Every muscle aches, you have not eaten for days
Fumble around, smell something rotting
The flame of a match reveals the bodies

Dancing shadows make the bodies come alive
Death grins turn into putrid smiles
Scream your lungs out, only echoes will answer
The dead tremble with laughter
Every time your match burns out they crawl closer
Your flesh will be their last supper

They surround youâ¦
Now they can almost reach your throat
They mock youâ¦
They tell you how theyâll crush your bones
Theyâll force you
to join their undead putrid rows
Theyâll make you
lose your body, mind and soul

This is the place where you will die
Living dead will eat you alive
Teeth sink into your flesh
It will be their bread
Blood spills like the sweetest of wines
Your veins burst and you bleed dry
Blood is their elixir of life
You know youâre dead, you know youâre dead,
You know youâre fucking dead

Hunger, thirst, darkness
awaken your madness
The bodies around you
they stare, they whisper
Their voices ring in
your ears like shouts
They tell you, ensure you
that thereâs no way out
They whisperâ¦
They shoutâ¦ 

Cold stone walls, no way out
Thereâs no door, no exit
Nowhere to run or hide
Thread of life spun, measured and cut

Blood, all over
Your limbs are missing chunks of flesh
Game over
Your skin is pale and torn to shreds
Exposure
of intestines and organs
Death creeps closer
Stone floor â your dying bed

Hunger, thirst, darkness
awaken your madness
The bodies around you
they stare, they whisper
Their voices ring in
your ears like shouts
They tell you, ensure you
that thereâs no way out
They whisperâ¦

At the very end you realize
Thereâs been no one but you all the time
Your teeth in your flesh
You ate yourself to death
In your thirst you made yourself bleed dry
You drank your blood like it was wine
Madness made you take your own life
You know youâre dead, you know youâre dead,
You know youâre fucking dead
You're dead
