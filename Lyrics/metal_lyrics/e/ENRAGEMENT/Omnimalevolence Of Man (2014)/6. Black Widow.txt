A look in the mirror
will not reveal
the putrid form
hidden beneath
an inch of make-up.
Expensive clothes
to hide the cheap
nature of the mind so low.
Inside the decay grows.

Forked tongue, a breath so foul, empty promises as empty as your soul â you have no soul
You donât see it, but with every lie the rotting flesh falls off your bones â still you stand bold

Behind it all â the money shot plan,
the one goal that you know
Find and marry a rich old man
The bald dome shines like gold

Feline stalker,
Feminine hunter
Look for the unsuspecting prey

Wealthy widower,
unhealthy oldtimer
Sink your claws in the human game

Like sirens you sing your song
You smile and flash your thong
Viagra could be confused with
rat poison, just make him consume it

Wed him, bed him
Wait for him to die
Collect the good wifeâs prize
The good wifeâs prize

Heâs dead, youâre left
Now you feel alive
But youâve been dead all the time
Dead all your life

You have dug
your own tomb
Ground has sunk
upon you
Thereâs no one
left to fool
