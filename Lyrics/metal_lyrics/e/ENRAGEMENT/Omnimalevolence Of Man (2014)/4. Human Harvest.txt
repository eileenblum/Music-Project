History repeatsâ¦

On the border red dawn rises
Fields fill with fear
Merciless murder of masses
Will begin here

Machetes no longer cut crop
But sever heads
Serving as the bloodbath spot
The river overflows with dead

Harvesters become the harvest

Madman comes up with a remedy:
purity of race
Weak minds abandon sanity,
embrace the craze

Madman comes up with a remedy:
bad blood erased
Weak minds abandon sanity
and blindly obey,
gladly obey

Shibboleth
One question trial, one word defense
Racial predation

Life and death
hang by a thread before one sentence:
decapitation

Perejil! 

History repeatsâ¦

Once again the river is baptized
by massacre
Its history forever vocalized
with its name whispered

Organized extermination
A despotâs scheme
The product of segregation
in this tyrannical regime

Harvesters become the harvest

Madman comes up with a remedy:
purity of race
Weak minds abandon sanity,
embrace the craze

Madman comes up with a remedy:
bad blood erased
Weak minds abandon sanity
and blindly obey
Minds led astray
