I came here to fulfill my dreams
I came here for you to kill me,
to take torture to the extreme
Make it slow, take the time you need
to ruin my body completely

I bleed internally
You bludgeon me frantically
Wreak havoc in me
Keep hammering furiously

Pierce my lungs with burning stakes
Catching flames, my midriff bakes
Tears of joy and pain I shed
Masturbation perfected

I inhale the sweet pain
Then exhale a blood rain
Basement floor wets with red
But I am yet more wet

Fill my mouth with razorblades
Get creative, add two-inch nails
make me chew, make me swallow
From inside theyâll carve me hollow

I fall to the floor
Torture me more

Hit me, kick me, beat me
Tread on my arms and legs

Hit me, kick me, smack me
Hack me to pieces

Sound of my bones breaking,
the cracks, exhilarating
With hammer, you devastate
I ejaculate

Now it is the time
for you to end my life
Slash, mutilate,
stab, eviscerate

Donât hesitate
Do it, decapitate me
