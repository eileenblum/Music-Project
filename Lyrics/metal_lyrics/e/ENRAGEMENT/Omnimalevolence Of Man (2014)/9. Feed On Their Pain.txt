Nothing can quench your thirst
Bloodlust has taken control
You need to witness suffering,
Youâre thrilled by death and tragedy,
atrocities and agony

Piles of fresh corpses rising
as high as mountains
Blood splatters shine to your eyes
like stars on pitch black skies

You witness people starving
But empathyâs long gone
Not a single fuck is given
Their hell is your heaven

Disasters, genocides,
war zones, lost human rights
and cities torn asunder
are like attractions to wonder

Destruction, loss of lives,
human natureâs darker side
are the things that make you smile,
they make you feel more than alive

Death calls you like moths to light
A sick wish to see people die
Welcome to the other side
Thereâs no turning back this time

You can no more hold
yourself back, not a second
You must inflict pain
by yourself, you canât refrain

Sanity is vanity,
youâve lost your sense of reality
Depravity, insanity
youâre lost in your sick fantasy

Now you know you have gone too far,
but you cannot return
When watching is no more enough,
your bridges have burnt
You pick someone no one will miss
you torture, rape and kill
You kill!
