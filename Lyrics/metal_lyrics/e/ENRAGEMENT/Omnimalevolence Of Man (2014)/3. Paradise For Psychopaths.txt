World turns its back and shuts its eyes,
sticks fingers in its ears and cries

Chaos swallows this land
Turmoil licks the plate clean
Man unveils its poison glands,
and commits horrors unseen

Welcome
to the place where life is as cheap
as the bullet that takes it

The thrum
of gunfire is more mundane
than the sound of pouring rain

Purgatory for inhabitants
New infernal fall of man
No laws to control the wrath 
Paradise for psychopaths

Child soldiers are hired to fight
in a war of religions,
exposed to inhuman sights
to grow aggression
Follow orders
of warmongers
Fuel the anger
Hate grows stronger

Burn down their home villages
Rape, spread the lethal disease

SÃ©lÃ©ka takes advantage of
the vast disarray
Sanity is allowed to rot
Humanity fades away

Follow orders
of warmongers
Mob of braindead
has just been bred

Beat down the children and wives
Feed the men to crocodiles

Infants left behind for serpents
No funerals, not a lament

Judge, jury, executioner
incarnate in a single soldier

Death knell
plays and the ocean of flames
rages as the self-proclaimed

angels
of death come to bring judgement
Will we bow down and repent?
Will we bow down and repent?
