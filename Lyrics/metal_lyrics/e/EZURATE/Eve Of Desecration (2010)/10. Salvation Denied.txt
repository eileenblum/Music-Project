For the helpless mortals, know the end is coming.
In the thrones of Armageddon, we seal their fate.
I am the unholy misanthrope, who crucified your leader.
When the forces of evil are aligned, I will take the throne.
Fear falls upon the faces of the helpless.
Unholy extermination of this hypocritical society.
Fools of the false religion, that pray for salvation.
God cannot save you, you are the chosen for termination.
Pray to the God that I have captured.
There is no salvation God will die, I am the master.
Burning higher are the flames of hell, a world in disaster.
Salvation Denied for the sinners, as they pray death comes faster.
Destroying all that is holy, entering Satan's realm, and watch you perish.
I am the demon of war, apprentice to Satan, sent to destroy, and inflict pain and misery.
I destroy the Edens of the earth, and bring God to his knees.
I am the reality, and reign as the chosen burn for eternity.

Holiness falls to defeat, Christianity finally extinct.
Impaled is God, so the promise pf Salvation Denied!!!

Unholy sacrifice another Christian dies, for Christ has died in vain.
Satan's law prevails, for this, the realm of eternal suffering!!!
