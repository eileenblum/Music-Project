Celebration!!!
I am he, who was created by the Catholic Church.
Tried for heresy and burned at the stake.
I am first and most powerful of my kind.
Who kills the living and drinks their blood.
Reenactment of my exorcism will shift the balance.
Unstoppable in the rays of the sunlight.
Ever widening the pattern in search of.
The Black Cross of Berziers!!!
Using an ancient forbidden form of the ceremony, and a medieval astrological sign of the sun.
Bring me the blood of the crusader, and crucify him upon a burning cross.
Reenactment of my exorcism will shift the balance.
Unstoppable in the rays of the sunlight.
Ever widening the pattern in search of.
The Black Cross of Berziers!!!
"You who have created me, holy crusader, and you hate what you have made."
"And why do you hate me so? "Because you fear me, because I am superior to you!!!
[Solo: Blackthorn]
For six hundred years I have fed off your kind at will.
I am immortal, eternal, vulnerable, and I am alive in darkness.
Them climax of the inverse exorcism must coincide with the first rays of the sun.
Then I will finally be transformed into a creature of light.
Now I am a master of light I will stalk the earth. Telepathic visions are present in me.
The ritual is now completed, my body destroyed. But my possessed soul remains.
Reenactment of my exorcism will shift the balance.
Unstoppable in the rays of the sunlight.
Ever widening the pattern in search of.
The Black Cross of Berziers!!!
