We are the unholy and yearn to see Christ die!!!
The Son of God must pay for their mortal sins.
The prophet of the New Church must be crucified.
Kill the Savior and complete the will of Satan!!!

Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, a servant of Satan.
Death by suicide on the tree upon the sorrowful hill.
Nail the Son of God for the lies he has bestowed on thee.
Onward to Golgotha, the Roman Sanctuary of Blasphemy!!!

Nail him to the cross!!!
Nail the spikes through his veins!!!
Stab the spear through, and pierce his heart!!!
For your king, a crown of thorns, see Jehovah Bleed!!!

[Solo: Blackthorn]

Nail him to the cross!!!
Nail the spikes through his veins!!!
Stab the spear through, and pierce his heart!!!
For your king, a crown of thorns, see Jehoviah Bleed!!!
Death to the Savior, for the sins of man will prevail.
Sent by God to save the world from the unholy.
Jehovah Bleed for you enemies.
We are the ones who see through the lies of the Holy Scriptures.
Beaten without any mercy.
Crucified with the burden of sin.
As he was once warned by Satan.
I am the vessel for which evil speaks, see Jehovah Bleed!!!
