Demon legions preparing for war, awaiting the apocalypse, the ending.
They are pure hatred, pure evil, and pure merciless slaughter.
When worlds collide, no more dawn will shine.
The warlords of hell must prevail, in this final war, destruction of the Holy Lord. 
Unleashed are the unholy regiments.
Bloodshed is the means of their existence.
They break the spells of the holy laws.
On this eve of desecration!!!
Revelations has been written, eternal dusk in a blood red sky.
They hunger for the purest blood, the blood of Mother Mary!!!
Sabbatical goat of lust watches God fall to his knees.
With merciless hatred, victory is ours, Destroying Divinity!!!
[Solo: Blackthorn]
[Solo: Velac]
[Solo: Blackthorn]
[Solo: Velac]
The angels of God, endlessly beaten into submission.
Spreading their fears throughout the Holy Land, see the fear in his eyes.
Demons of the blasphemous hierarchy, the onslaught of hell unleashed upon the Holy.
Now begins Satan's reign for all eternity, by Destroying Divinity!!!
