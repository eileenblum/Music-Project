I must travel in silence to the seven zones above the earth, to the last temples of Ur. 
Entering uncharted territory, taking a path that leads to equality with God. 
I have solved the enigma of the ancient races that preceded us. 
I must travel alone and bring forth the key and unlock the Seven Gates!!! 
I call to thee!!! Thou must observe the moon of purification. 
I call to thee!!! Thou must approach the gate with awe. I call to thee!!! Thou must light the lamp of the summoning respective star. 
I call to thee!!! Thou must recite the invocation of the watcher.
[Solo: Blackthorn]
Ignite the spheres of the seven demons of the flame.
Erase me from the book of life, my master.
Transcribe me in the Black Book of death.
And lead me to the Seven Gates!!!
I call to thee!!! Thou must take the seal and whisper its name.
I call to thee!!! Thou must recite the incantation of the walking.
I call to thee!!! Thou must fall to the ground at the center of the gate.
I call to thee!!! Unlock the gates and reap the fruits of discovery.
[Solo: Velac]
[Solo: Blackthorn]
I will prepare the altar to face the Northern sky.
I will light the fires of the Four Gates of the earth.
I will walk the steps of the Ladder of Lights.
And will go forward through the secret passage.
Wanderer throughout eternity, among the dark spaces between the stars.
Gate keeper of the Celestial gods, open thy gate to thee!!!
God of victory over the Holy Angels, from the world between the spheres.
Conqueror of the serpents of the sea and keeper of the Seven Gates!!!
