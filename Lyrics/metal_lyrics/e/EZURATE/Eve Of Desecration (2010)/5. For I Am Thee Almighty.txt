I the most vile spirit, the truculent one, the inducer of incest, the teacher of heretics.
I despise the one who shed for man his most precious blood.
I despise the Holy Ghost, through
His blessed apostle, tried to expel thee!!!
I am Satan!!! The most highest one!!!
I am Satan!!! The most deceitful one!!!
I am Satan!!! The most unholy one!!!
I am Satan!!! The Almighty one!!!
I who deny the one crucified, the power of Christ does not compel thee!!!
And I come forth by thy might defend thy cause!!!
I, who trust in no one, will behold a fortified tower in the face of the Holy One!!!
I am Satan!!! The most highest one!!!
I am Satan!!! The most deceitful one!!!
I am Satan!!! The most unholy one!!!
I am Satan!!! The Almighty one!!!
I crush the cross of the Lord, evidence of my hostile power.
I transcend the serpents and the scorpions.
I instill terror into the beast!!!

I am Satan!!! The most highest one!!!
I am Satan!!! The most deceitful one!!!
I am Satan!!! The most unholy one!!!
I am Satan!!! The Almighty one!!!
I, who condemn the Holy Trinity, let God's cry come unto thee.
I, the tyrant of everlasting hell, my power will reign supreme forever!!!
The blood of the Legions commands thee!!!
I Satan the father, commands thee!!!
Lucifer the prince commands thee!!!
The mark of the beast commands thee!!!
