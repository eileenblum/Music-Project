Under the light of the moon. I will metamorphosize into a supernatural being.
Into the forest I will roam. With a sadistic craving for blood!!!
The powers of darkness, the undead surround me. My victims walk the earth in Limbo.
When the moon no longer holds its sway. Witness the Metamorphosis of a Lycan!!!

As the smell of blood fills the midnight air. Feel the thick aerial effigy of the beast.
When the crescent moon takes full form. Deep into the woods, hear the unleashed. The powers of darkness, the undead surround me. My victims walk the earth in Limbo.
When the moon no longer holds its sway. Witness the Metamorphosis of a Lycan!!!

I adore the moonlight. Its beauty calls to me!!!

Avoid the bite of the beast. Try to sever the bloodline.
Armed with a pentacle of pure silver . A pentacle branded in blood!!!

I will transform, into a beast formed in shadows!!!

[Solo: Blackthorn]

The powers of darkness, the undead surround me. My victims walk the earth in Limbo.
When the moon no longer holds its sway. Witness the Metamorphosis of a Lycan!!!

The shapeshifters feel the moonlight. With increased strength, and heightened senses.
They beware, the pentagram, a five-pointed star. But beware the carnivorous, lunar night!!!
