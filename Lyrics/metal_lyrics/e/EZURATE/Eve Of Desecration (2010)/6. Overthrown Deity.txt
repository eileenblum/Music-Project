The gates of hell are open wide.
Unleashing the beast and the hellish might.
Flames engulf the earth, effigy of hell.
The angels we kill, are sacrificed, under Satan's spell.
The beautiful angels turned to sinful whores.
By the darkest evil demons from hell.
Their souls are raped from their angelic beings.
And fall helplessly into the abyss, Overthrow the Deity!!!
We attack the followers of Christ, with black hatred.
Their false beliefs not backed by faith, turns them vulnerable.
Under the sign of the Unholy Arch Goal God is slain.
Show no mercy, attack with vigor, ignore the cries of the Holy!!!
The beautiful angels turned to sinful whores.
By the darkest evil demons from hell.
Their souls are raped from their angelic beings.
And fall helplessly into the abyss, Overthrow the Deity!!!
Thy deity is soon to be overthrown, God's demise.
Ascend into heaven, and kill the one called God.
Reign in torment, led by the Infernal Majesty.
We are Legion, we are the Infernal Horde!!!
[Solo: Blackthorn]
I see the angels fall into the fire, their wings have burned away!!!
He cannot save you now, God has led his world astray.
We burn haven's gate, Christ again crucified at the stake.
We are the fallen ones, we have returned for our vengeance.
We have killed the one who is forgiving.
Satan takes his throne, know the wrath of eternal suffering.
Overthrown Deity's lifeless soul.
Nailed upon an inverted cross.
For all the dying angels to see.
As he sits upon his throne, all shall witness.
The unholy coronation, death of the Holy Ghost!!!
Lucifer is now master, for the new eternity.
God has proven to be weak, he is the Overthrown Deity!!!
