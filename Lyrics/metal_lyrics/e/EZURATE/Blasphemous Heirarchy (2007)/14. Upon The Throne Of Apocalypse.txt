[Music - Valac]
[Lyrics - Holocausto Inferni]

It's the dawn of the Apocalypse
Satan's wrath will prevail
At the end of existence there is no resistence against the wrath of damnation
Pray for salvation, begging for your soul knowing there is no hope
Witness the kingdom of Satan and his throne
The wrath of damnation, end of creation, upon the throne of apocalypse
End of life as we know it, Earth becomes Hell, the world is ruled by the angel whom fell
The dawn of a new age, new world order
You were a hypocrite hiding behind the cross you bear
Once you were so high and mighty, now you are a mirror of your former self
Witness the new day of suffering bowing down to the throne of beasts
It's the dawn of the Apocalypse
Satan's wrath will prevail
As the old world dies, and the new one is born
[solo: Blackthorn]
Impaled servents upon inverted crosses, whilst they're ablaze
This is the wrath of damnation
Upon the throne of Apocalypse
