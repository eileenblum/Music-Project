[Music - Valac]
[Lyrics - Holocausto Inferni]

I am the dark apprentice serving Satan's will
I lie amongst darkness, Christians I kill
[chorus]
Resurrection of ancient evil
I kill the god of the feeble
Promised an eternal life, slowly fades away
I mock the crucifixion
I exist to create Christian extinction
As their souls fall to Hell and burn for eternity
[repeat chorus]
I have been summoned by the evilest souls
To kill the Christians that plague the earth
[chorus]
I am from the black dominion
Beyond the infernal gates
Where their fate awaits
Taking the immortal soul
From the lifeless body
Evil from below, Hell is where they reign
[solo: Blackthorn]
[repeat chorus]
