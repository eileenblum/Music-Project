[Music - Blackthorn]
[Lyrics - Holocausto Inferni]

Your pathetic life has come to an end, Judgment Day has now arrived
Will you enter the gates of Heaven?  Or will you descend into the realm of eternal shadows?
[1st bridge]
Fall into darkness, the eternal said
Burn for eternity
God has turned his back on thee, you've lived a sinful life
As you are cast to Hell, the smell of Hades upon you
[repeat 1st bridge]
[2nd bridge]
In the lands of everlasting darkness Satan's realm now reigns supreme
Father Satan save me from the spell of Christianity
Eternal darkness now surrounds thee, eternal suffering now is upon thee
Master Satan has spoken to thee, vengeance is mine, now for thee
Burning in Hell for eternity!!!
We are all servents of Satan!!!
What is thy bidding my master!!!
To serve in the lands of everlasting darkness!!!
[solo: Blackthorn]
[repeat 2nd bridge]
