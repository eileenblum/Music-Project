[Music - Blackthorn]
[Lyrics - Blackthorn]

A star burns across the midnight sky, crack of thunder
A bolt of lightning breaks the deaf silence
Show me the secret number, show me the secret shape
Keeper of the secret names, show me the signs
Look across the black seas, look for the black horizons
Look for the eclipse of the sun, look for the signs of Armageddon
Bring together which has been thinded, bring together the bible
Utter his name in reverse the last name of God
[chorus]
Make me the one begotten son reveal to me upon this hour
Make me the one begotten son reveal to me upon this hour
The visions of a world start to uncreate, heed thy blackened sun
Axis of evil at my command, let him reign upon this hallowed night
Bring in darkness, shade the light fulfill this tonight, my destiny
[solo: Blackthorn]
Look at the midnight sky, look for the black horizon
Look for the sweat upon the beast, look for the sign in the prisms
[repeat chorus]
