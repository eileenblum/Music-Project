[Music - Blackthorn]
[Lyrics - Blackthorn]

The clock struck at midnight, the six conspirators met
He hid in the shadows to conceal his complexion
Cursed by a vile disease, leader of a leper colony
Under a full moon we planned his death
[pre-chorus]
Set ablaze a fire on the shore strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist
Out of the night, an unearthly fog rolled in
For a moment's time they could see nothing
[chorus]
The ship crashed against the rocks, the wreckage sank to the bottom of the sea
The fog recessed back across the waters and never came again
But when the fog returns the crew's lungs filled with salt water
Their eyes open staring into the darkness will search for the fire
That lead them to their death and my death
[repeat pre-chorus]
[solo - Blackthorn]
In a moment's time it will vanish, watch as it recedes back across the seas
When mercury freezes, when everything turns to mist
Look across the water into the darkness, look out for the fog!!!
Were it possible to raise the dead, I would return his fortune
I am the sixth conspirator, lead me to my death for the witching hour
From twelve to one belongs to the dead, I am a thief, I hold the keys to the tomb of gold
Set ablaze a fire on the shore strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist
Out of the night, an unearthly fog rolled in
For a moment's time they could see nothing
[repeat chorus]
Is this anything, but a nightmare is all we see or seen a dream within a dream
When mercury freezes, when everything turns to mist, look across the water
Into the glowing darkness, look out for the fog
Look out for the fog!!!
