[Music - Valac]
[Lyrics - Holocausto Inferni]

Rendered to dust, dead in your crypt
Die for your mortal sins
Nuclear holocaust, die for the sins of man
Rendered to dust, ashes remain
Don't believe in the lies of eternal life, there is no God
There is no existence after you die
You pray to a false god, for He does not exist
Your destiny is to be buried in the ground
Or entombed in a mausoleum
Dead in your box, maggots infest
Divine smell of rot, as you are laid to rest
You're just a soulless corpse, dead in your box
For you I have no remorse, forever trapped you'll rot
You suffer from the incurable Christian faith
Laid to rest, you are deceased, won't escape the rotting
Resurrect eternal pain obsessed with death
Born to suffer punishment
[solo: Blackthorn]
Rendered to dust, there is no afterlife
Only the end, eternal strife
