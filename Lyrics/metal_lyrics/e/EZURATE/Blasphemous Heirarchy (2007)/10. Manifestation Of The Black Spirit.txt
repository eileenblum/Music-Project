[Music - Valac]
[Lyrics - Holocausto Inferni]

Manifestation of the black spirit!!!
[1st verse]
I am the one that dwells in darkness, I serve the will of evil
Hatred and disgust fills my soul
An undying hatred for Christianity
On the night of the crimson moon a metamorphosis now occurs
Within my black soul
Soon to bring the day of wrath, in my black heart
[repeat 1st verse]
The black spirit manifesting in me, I am now an unholy creation
Having no memory of my former, I am reborn
For I am the great manifestation of the black spirit
The burning desires of lust now fill my spirit with the women of holiness
I fornicate, incubus of shadows, and in their dreams
Planting deep my evil seed, in the disciples of God
Procreating a new race of demonic drones, unleashed upon the earth
To make Christianity extinct, feel my vengeance upon thee
A holy death, another Christian is murdered
[solo: Blackthorn]
In the name of Satan, lord of the undivine, destroying divinity
I am the manifestation of the black spirit
King of the nether world, all will praise me
As all the churches burn to the ground!!
