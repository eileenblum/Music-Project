Constantinople has fallenAn evil of invincible forceSwept across the Carpathian MountainsOut of Transylvania arose a great roman knightFrom the sacred order of the dragons, Known as the Dracu's. Victories of that great race are a tale to be told. For I am the last of my kind I condemn you to living deathTo eternal hunger for living bloodYou impotent men with their foolish swellsCannot portect your from my power I renounce GodI shall rise from my own deathTo avenge with all the powers of darknessThe blood is the life and it shall be mineI bring you from the light into the shadowsDarkness is my lightLifeless, soulless, hated and fearedI am the monster that breathing men would kill Across the icy seas to my landI will grow strong, wolves howl, the children of the night. Do not put your faith in such trinkets of deceitI will release the powers of darkness What devil or witch was ever so greatAs the demon that flows through my veinsBeyond the grace of GodWonderer of the outer darknessYou will be my devoted discipleI walk to feed upon precious blood Condemned to hell I commandWinds!!! Winds!!! Winds!!! You think you can destroy meI have sereved the cross, the light of all lightsHundreds of years before you were bornLook at what your God has done to me My land, the most beautiful place in creation A land beyond a great, great forestSurrounded by majestic mountainTo be found nowhere elseIn the catacoms of my castleYou will enter through my haunted caverns
