Repudiate the protection of the Virgin MaryDisclaim the baptismal chrismTrample under foot the cross of ChristNever adore the sacraments Demon lord I offer to theeA virgin of Christ by sorceryBaptized in fire Renounce the trinity, Jesus ChristBaptized in fireDeny the sacraments of the holy churchBaptized in fireCommit myself, body and soulBaptized in fireAdjure the statue of the Virgin and the SaintsBaptized in fire I deny the oath of the churchI deny the creator of heaven and  earthI deny the Christian faithI adhere to Satan, baptized with unholy fire I swear allegiance only to himWithin the burning circle marked on the groundBaptized in fire The mark is scorched and drawnBaptized in fireIn exiled depths unknown to the lambBaptized in fireDemon lord I serve only theeBaptized in fireThe day of wrath has come forthBaptized in fire Thou who wills to master the artsMust covet the seals beyond the gatsBaptized in fire
