Blackened sun has set
Full moon harvest
Spells are of one with the natural forces
Root of evil grows in the ground

Red Celtic wolves appear from the forest
Watching a congregation of witches and druids
Cautiosly are they with the root
For they know death will follow

Dark and cold as ice
The season of evil demoncy
On this black and bitter night
Demon lord shall arise

In the book of shadows, Pan and Lucifer are one
The cross of Christ angers them

Celtic and Nordic runes
For they're horned god has come
Virgin sacrifice
Screams through the freezing night

Season of the witch!!!
Season of the witch!!!
