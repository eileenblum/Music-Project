Irrevernt to the one called GodArch angel falling from the skyOnto the fog covered frozen earthCrack of thunder, Black storms arrive Burning angel rises from the ashesA new lord is bornEyes glaring watching over the planesAnd reclaim the throne of paradise Angels weep in heaven aboveIrreverent to the holy oneLight shall be no moreAngels decent from black moon skies Attacking the kingdom above with vengeance and hate. Holy angels fight, yet powerful hordes destroyBattles in the sky, holy angels dieThrown to the ground God has died Upon darkened horizonEvil shall reign, lord of the nightDarkness will conquer the right of GodAnd reclaim the throne and kingdom of paradise Angels wept in heaven aboveLrreverent to the holy oneLight sahll be no moreGod descending through black moon skies
