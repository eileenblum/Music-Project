I am ruler of blackness, full moon terror
In daytime eclipse
I am lord of eternal night
To my lord Lucifer, I am servant

I am master of nature
In bloodlust of howling wolves
Darkest fog and torrid ice storms
I have crossed oceans of time to conquer

Adoration for the immortals
Possessor of souls
Those who were born
And aged without life

Beautiful women I possess
To do my blackest magic
The weak I show no mercy
Condemn them to the abyss and dark horizons

I am he, the tast of stale and stagnant water
I am he, who hungers for Mother Mary's blood
I am he, the black fire of hatred
I am he, Chorozon possessor of twilight shadows

I live immortalized since Christ was slain
I summon the most darkest evil souls

Forever I will rule
Over land, Sea and the winds
Possessing all that dwell in my kingdom
The whores, the insane and the weak

I enslave the innocent to be dark
For they have no life
I the shadow lord, the fire walker
I the creature of the night

Over fog and shoadows I am master
Bloodlust and unpure hearts
All I adore is my midnight lust
Evil, unthinkable magic

In my kingdom of diabolical wilderness
Order of the Seraphim
A warrior, a king, a prince of darkness calls
Upon the souls of the underworld

War and Armageddon will rise
Nocturnal creature I behold

So to whomever I conjure I am God
I drank the blood of Christ
On the day of his death
I now will live forever.
