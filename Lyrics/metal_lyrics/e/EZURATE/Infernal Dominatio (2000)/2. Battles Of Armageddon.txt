I awaken from the blackened sea
Rising up with the name of blasphemy
I am the dragon which gave power onto the beast
Behold I am thee

Spirits of the devils go forth unto the knights of the earth. Gather them for the battle, that great day to dethrone God the almighty

Shed the blood of the saints and the prophets
Evil poured upon the salts of the earth
Scorched from the great heat from the sun
Powers given unto me, voices of thunder and lightning

Unholy spirits descend from the mouth of the dragon.Gater them into a place called Armageddon

Cast upon the earth burn the great mountain
Fire cast into the sea as rivers and sea became blood

A great star burning through the blackened sky
Listen not to the voice from the four horns of the golden alter

Spirits of the devils go forth unto the kings of the earth. Gather them for the battle, that great day to dethrone God the almighty

The dead angels of God scattered across the ashes of Sodom. Upon the blackened horizons, God will watch thy kingdom rise

Battles of Aemageddon!!!
