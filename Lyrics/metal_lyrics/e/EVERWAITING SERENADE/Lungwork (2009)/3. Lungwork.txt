It's time to choose your friends
Let's gather for the hardest chapter life put aside for us
And when the clouds assemble you better make sure to be around
Sailors, iceberg ahead

If I shall drown, I drown enlaced with you
Enlace the memory, an act of bravery

To where tomorrows are wrapped in wisdom
Rudders forever steer, our eyes forever stare
To where tomorrows are wrapped in wisdom
Rudders forever steer, our eyes forever stare

Apparently, we're all sharing a boat, remember the iceberg
Remember, just remember, remember the iceberg

Let's gather for the hardest chapter life put aside for us
And when the clouds assemble you better make sure to be around

Just remember, remember the iceberg
I'm barely talented to straighten things out
But for once I set aside poetry and focus on your mind:

It's time to chose your friends
Define your allies

If the floods fill my lungs promise to shut my eyes
With these scarce grains of sand whirling in the stream
Forever, I cement my ground, enough to face the flood

Apparently, we're all sharing a boat remember the iceberg
Prepare to split and segregate my former followers
