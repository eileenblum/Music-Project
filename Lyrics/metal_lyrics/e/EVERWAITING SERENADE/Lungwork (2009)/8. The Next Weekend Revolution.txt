Frail steps of the most brave are doomed to failure
No one will ever catch you when you fall

Within these walls
We give it all

Let us share the most beautiful and honest way to be ourselves

Within these walls we're dancing on our own remains

we're dancing with the skyline

do not dare to barricade our way
within these walls we blossom

time runs out and we go down in history
for short-lived moments of truth

the next weekend revolution
you'll be my witness
this is the next weekend revolution
enough said, we'll handle this on our own
Revolution! Revolution!

Time would swallow us in one piece
But we promise not to move until it scatters our ashes

With every strike you stand up stronger
But you may never erase the trace left in your heart

Testify the next weekend revolution
Testify the next weekend revolution

The next weekend revolution
You'll be my witness this is
The next weekend revolution

Within these walls
We blossom, we wither
