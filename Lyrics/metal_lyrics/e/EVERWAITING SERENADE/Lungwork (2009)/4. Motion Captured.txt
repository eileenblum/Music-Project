The silence of this view we're sharing is the most stunning sound that comes around when our voices fade away

Stars would kill the greatest poetry
If your conscience wasn't built by godlike purity

Eyes wide shut, try to perceive
What of this world I could receive
I reach out for your silhouette

My senses lead me to the purest of every sin
Thrown back to the moment where everything began

But I'm rising again, sheltered by your light
Again, I am slowly taking the beat back

To explain what you mean to me
And yet another failed attempt
To explain what you mean to me
And yet another failed attempt
To explain this rationally

And if one day, I'll catch a glimpse of any sense
You'll deserve better than me
Cause if I could define this
I wouldn't love you enough

Fading away, lost in the wires of formulations
I want to forever choke on words
