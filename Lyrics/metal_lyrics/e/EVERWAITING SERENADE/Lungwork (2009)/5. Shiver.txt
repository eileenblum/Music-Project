You may never erase the trace left in your heart
You may never erase the trace left in your heart

There is something that will forever remain
There is someone that will forever remain
There is something that will forever remain

The shine in your eyes is sending shivers down my spine
From here and there unite for genuine exchanges
Nothing could tear apart this bliss

We gave it all for the shiver
Harbor this inner peace

We gave it all
You may never erase the trace left in your heart
And there is something that will forever remain
There is something that will forever remain
