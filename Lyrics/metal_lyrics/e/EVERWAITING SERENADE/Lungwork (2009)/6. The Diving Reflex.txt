Jump into our magnet's spectrum
Escape, pull back
You wouldn't be here if you didn't want to lose control
Fuse the soil with the ceiling
Dive with me into the invisible
Dive with me into the indivisible

...but you really wanna get moved
you really wanna get moved
I know why you're here, be welcomed open-armed
you really wanna get moved
and when you open your eyes, I've finished torching your skies
you really wanna get moved
your world burns upside down, crossfire hell and come back for more
you really wanna get moved
