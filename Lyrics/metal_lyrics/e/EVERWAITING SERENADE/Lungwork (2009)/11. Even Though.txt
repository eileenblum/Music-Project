This fight is long
And I am weary
Never before have I faced such fear
Endless, I burn my eyes
For I made this promise
To keep you safe from harm
But this might be the last time
I can call you by name

This fight is long
This fight is long
This fight is long and I am weary
Never before have I faced such fear
Endless, I break my eyes
For I made this promise
To keep you safe from harm
But this might be the last time
I can call you by name
The last time I can call you by name
And I know your name
Speaks things I cannot describe
These failures will not prevail
In the face of defeat
We strive what's in our hearts
We strive for what's in our hearts
