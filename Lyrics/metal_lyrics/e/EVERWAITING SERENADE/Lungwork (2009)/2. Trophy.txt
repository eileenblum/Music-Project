Anyone? Interested in collecting my parts from this dance floor?
Anyone? Interested in connecting my lungs to a breath of fresh air?

This is where I learn everything they failed to teach
Wrap up your lessons and bury your books
Witness life in merciless proportions

Everything they failed to teach
Five members means four commitments

I've been a pupil for too long
In the academy of life I gave my best to stand strong

This is the testing, boiling and uprising
This is the trial they put me through
Five members means four commitments

Can anyone honestly pretend to fail one single person?
When he constantly has to guarantee satisfaction for four?

Anyone? Anyone interested in switching chairs?

We gave our inner most
We gave our inner most to stand strong
We gave our inner most
We gave our inner most and we stood strong

Welcome to annihilation, welcome to the fold
Welcome disintegration, welcome to passion
Prepare for a heart attack
Beware of the side effects

Four implied promises
This is where I learn everything they failed to teach

I've never been closer to a heart attack
But I wouldn't trade this for anything in the world
The hottest contestant to the jackpot never jeopardizes chances, Hunter, never prey
I am about to decorate my chimney with another trophy
