Keep it surreal
Let's just keep it surreal
Since the day that I've been denying gravity's embrace.

Still I wonder what it's like
Wonder what it's like to fight
Still I wonder what it's like to fight for you

I could not
Mention one thing I would rather do
Than nourish the flame that supplies your desire

Still I wonder what it's like to fight for you tonightÂ 
Let's keep it surreal
Have you ever seen magic so close you could feel it?
Let's keep it surreal, we keep it surreal. Period.

I could not mention one thing I'd rather do
Than nourish the flame supplying your desire

But still I wonder what it's like to fight for you
Have you ever seen magic so close you could feel it?
We keep it surreal
To find comfort in drying tears
Breathing in the purity of instants coming back

If supremacy faltered, if levitation trembled
Would we accept and concede mistakes
Raising motion for solution
Finding comfort
Finding comfort

Do I want to know?
Do I really need to know?
I must be jaded, I'm teasing the throne of perfection.
