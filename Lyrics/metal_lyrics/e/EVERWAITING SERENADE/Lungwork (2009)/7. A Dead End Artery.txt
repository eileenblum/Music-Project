So long it's been
Since my reflection's not giving in
The sands of time forced their path through me
Now leaving half things behind
I choose one leading role

Hold high the sacrifice to never compromise myself again

I gave up so many dreams just to protect this one
I gave up so many chances just to protest this time
I could not be more stripped than this
Be more defenceless
A target for every attack
A blank outline in your hunting sight
I'm running wild with your barrel pointing south

I shall hold high the sacrifice to never compromise myself again

Running wild with your barrel to my mouth
But now I blaze through a sparkle
I shine through a whisper

I shine through you

So long it's been, since I
Hold high my commitment,
this is my commitment to life
this is my commitment to you
I shine through a whisper
I shine through you
