No limits for the restless
The trust we got in music will
Never move these mountains
Again we lose our hope in
Melodies to provide the shelter we need

Our hopes and dreams will always turn to
The granted values of education, work and family
Things we can hold on to
In real times of trouble
Wired in restrictions
We will always struggle
To reward our passion, to reward our passion with wings

Common everybody this is for the restless

But within the limits of these shadows
I find my own way to be free
Forget the American Dream
Our fertile grounds are soaked in safety
Forget the American Dream
Our fertile grounds are soaked in safety

"Success is a few liquid dreams away":
A complex we still need to overcome
A complex we'll always have to overcome

We've been painfully holding on to our routine
IÂ âm not sitting here trying to lament over myself
Not being a part, of the American Way of Life
Self-inflicted complex of inferiority

"Success is a few liquid dreamsÂ away"
Success...dream away.
