This is the story of all life's emotion
Wrapped up inside one heart
I can be your love for the rest of your life
And always play the part

Someone to love and a family
Someone to hold and protect me
I remember when I left your side
You asked me why

You said goodbye Cancer baby, goodbye
Take care of yourself inside
Goodbye Cancer baby, goodbye
You just broke down and you cried

The years I remember seem all to endless
The shifting of moons and tides
One minute I'm up the next I'm down
I'll leave you to wonder why

Someone to stand by me
Someone to look to for security
I remember when I left your side
The look in your eyes

You said goodbye Cancer baby, goodbye
Take care of yourself inside
Goodbye Cancer baby, goodbye
You just broke down and you cried

Goodbye Cancer baby, goodbye
