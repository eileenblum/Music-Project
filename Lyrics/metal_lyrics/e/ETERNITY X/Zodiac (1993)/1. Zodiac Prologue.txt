There is a place within every living thing that holds the key to its 
creation
It is in this place we find who we are
It is also in this place we find the secret of the Zodiac

Welcome to my world
Step into my mirror
There's twelve stories to be told
And a billion souls to hear

There's fire that burns so brightly
There's water that flows through lives
There's air that we never see
And earth the mother of life
And the Zodiac
