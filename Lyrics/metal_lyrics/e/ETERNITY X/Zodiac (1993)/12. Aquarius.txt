You need something different
And you don't know what it is
You're tired of playing that same old game
We'll look no further I'm the one to work it out
You'll really be glad that I came

I need peace of mind
Easy - all the time

You could say what you want to
I'll leave the work to you
Don't get too attached now
You're in the world of Aquarius

I breathe independency
Make no mistake this is the life
No one can get close to me
Emotions are the last thing on my mind

Making - my own pace
I won't - play their game

Just settle down now
They'll wait for us
No matter how things look now
You're in the age of Aquarius
