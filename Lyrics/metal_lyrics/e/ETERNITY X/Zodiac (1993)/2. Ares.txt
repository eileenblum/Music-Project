From the burning fires
The flame of intuition
The leader of the Zodiac he screams

The god of new beginnings
The lord of war and killings
The Mars ruled Aries rules my dreams

The rise of swords precedes Aries dreams
The flags and the march and the colors of the battle call
I have done more than they have dreamed
Protect your world and never let it fall

What's the point of waiting
What's your conscience saying
The ram never waits for you to move

I call it like I see it
No I'm not gonna take it
Oh Lord, I got something to prove

The rise of swords precedes Aries dreams
The flags and the march and the colors of the battle call
I have done more than they have dreamed
Protect your world and never let it fall
