Two sides to every story, one mind split in two
Changing our basic instinct
Communication will break you through

I want to see the other side
Another place in another time yeah

I wanna set your mind aflame
Perfect order countless ways yeah

Talk to me for I will talk with you
The twins of Gemini fly high
I will see, I will see you through
I will help you, I will try

Everything, I want more
Never happy with just one
There's two sides to every story
Every reason, everyone

Persuasion, I can change your mind
Anywhere, anytime yeah
Look into my eyes again
Mirrors of common sense yeah

Talk with me for I will talk with you
The twins of Gemini fly high
I will see, I will see you through I will help you
Lord I will try
