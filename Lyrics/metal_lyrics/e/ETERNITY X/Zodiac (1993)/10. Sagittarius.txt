So you need to learn about the centaur tonight
Take the heat the fire rules again
With me you'll learn the undiluted truth
An arrow set upon its sights

I got a prophecy for you
I'll take you to a distant place - (Where maybe)
There's nothing we won't do
I'm gonna take you to a place where we can be free

Sometimes I'm always on the wire
Name one of you that hasn't been there too
Most of us trust in something higher
Devoting all our lives to all of you

To a Sagittarian there's no discussion
About their freedom and the truth - (and maybe)
Creativity is our intention
Devoting all our lives to all of you

We see the world through a wild stallion's eye...
And we always do
