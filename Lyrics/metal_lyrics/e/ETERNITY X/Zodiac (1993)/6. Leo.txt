Turn the lights on I have arrived
And I got pride to burn
Just give me your admiration
Court is adjourned

The world is a crowded kingdom
And the sky is my crown
Some people say the room lights up
When I'm around

I'm the roar of the lion
I'm the call of the wild
I was born a superstar
Cause I'm a Leo child

There's gonna be a party tonight
We're gonna celebrate life
I'm not the ruthless one
I Just want the limelight

No air of mystery
No lines or lies
No cheatin' or possessive love
God I hate the kind

I'm the roar of the lion
I'm the call of the wild
I was born a superstar
Cause I'm a Leo child
