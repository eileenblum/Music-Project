In the story books when all of them give in
I'm the only one who is left standing
Venus, god of love reigns high in my life
Just remember that and understand me
Oh, I'll tell you what I want
I want you to be true
Most of all I wanted you

Look inside and maybe you will find (maybe someday)
A sentimental dream like no other kind (maybe someday)
Stick to the thought, never give up on me (maybe you will)
The Taurean trait, dependability

Don't push too hard, I'll never give in
I won't get it done if you keep on pushin'
The bull never looks for you, he never starts the war
But he'll always stand up to your challenge
Right - I'm fixed onto my sights
I'll get what I want tonight
The music takes me away

Look inside and maybe you will find (maybe someday)
A sentimental dream like no other kind (maybe someday)
Stick to the thought, never give up on me (maybe you will)
The Taurean trait, dependability
