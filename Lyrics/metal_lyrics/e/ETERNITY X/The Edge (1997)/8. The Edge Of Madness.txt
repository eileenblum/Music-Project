Through rose colored lies
Calling you names from my social island

Why can't I be happy again?
It's the way things are and I can't change them

It's the way

There is no cure!

A lust we can't control
It's a rather sick position dont'cha think?

In a talk that I had with a man who was mad...

It was here, it was there
Couldn't find it anywhere
It was up, it was down
Squares rolling round and round

It was crowded, it was lonely
A show written only for me
Had this sick and happy feeling
I was home again

It was old, it was new
Too many and too few
It was numbing, it was high
And I was laughing the whole time

It was cold, it was warm
It was clear but I saw the storm
Had a clear, distorted feeling
I'd be back again

Call me what you will
Satisfy yourself
Justify your position

Money
It's a problem
It's so much more
I can suppress this hole if I try

It's the way
There is no cure
It's a lust we can't control
It's a rather sick position dont'cha think?

In a nightmare that I had, with a sick, demented man...

Had no fear and no love
No faith in God above
It was truth, it was lies
The searing, burning kind

It was random, it was fate
Too soon and too late
Had this wild mixed up feeling
I was back again

It was death, it was life
A victim's last rights
It was playful, it was hurtful
And I loved it the whole time

It was there in my head
A lusting for the dead
Had this sick and happy feeling
I was home again

This is the slow part
Where the man always finds his way
A sad reflection, a resolution

So safe where you are, listening in your own surroundings
Where are you now, do you have me on while your driving?
Maybe your at home, perhaps in position compromising?

Then there's the five bastards
Playing this song right now
Cashing in on my plight

And who the fuck are they?
Do hey have the nightmares you and I do?
All right, it's okay, let them whore me, they'll get their due
And how 'bout you? You bought this song now just listen

No matter what you think of me
I'm the soul who'll be behind you one day
Tearing your life into little pieces

Hey I'm jealous of you
I can say that now but there's so much more to tell
I have the resolution, the quick solution to your problem
It's a rather sick position dont'cha think?

And the love that I have with this crazy, sick, old friend

It was dark, it was bright
A cold and stormy night
It was real, it wasn't there
I couldn't help but stare

It had started, it was over
Looking over shoulders
Had intense and lonely feelings
I was home again

It was here, it was there
Couldn't find it anywhere
It was up, it was down
Squares rolling round and round

It was crowded, it was lonely
A play written only for me
Had this sick and happy feeling
I was home again
