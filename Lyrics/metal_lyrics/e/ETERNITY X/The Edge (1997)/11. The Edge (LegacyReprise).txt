Hello, Lord, I'm here again
It's like I feared and then some more
It's gone, away

Cradle the calm and calm the weary
I must put this all behind me
It's like you said before
Here in silent dreams

Understand the way I see it
It seems like the world can't feel it
I know they don't need to Lord
No one takes pity on what they don't know

Here in a world of fate
The answers they come too late for me
The fire streaks the bloodstained sky

Drain the oceans and turn out the sun
Silence the laughter I have no need for them
Anymore
It's all been a dream from this day on

Holding the torch and torching the theory
Reaching for something to save me
Nothing I have known can save my soul tonight

I find that I'm all alone
Same as I've ever known
A voice from the edge, screaming something

Something from a fantasy
Screaming the final plea
The echoes they remain...

We'd like to take you to a place so far from here
A world of lost and shattered men

We've seen the world through their solemn fears
Spare all the pity that you can

Because we all walk on the edge at times
Holding on for our very lives

Only the ones who ever risk are truly free
Only the ones who risk ever fly

Now we see...It's a long way down
We believe...Is there an end?
Ours to stay...Find a reason
Ours to leave...Before you turn away

All alone...It's a long way home
Free to go...I'm really free
Time to see...I can see the end
Time to know...I can make it through

Where am I?
Have I really made it here?
You have reached the
You have reached the
You have reached the
You have reached....

The Edge
