"If you'd like to make a call please hang up and try again,
If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator"

Those times
When there was something inside
Something to fight for!
Something in you
(But) I don't care
Anymore....

I've wasted too much time already
I can't take anymore of your manipulation
I can feel my patience breaking!
You wanted me to come down with you?
Well here I am!!

You said somewhere that I oughta know
And you weren't gonna let me forget the pain I left you in
I can see your promise breaking!
Isn't it ironic?
You oughta know!!

There isn't anything left in me
That your sick, repulsive ways haven't taken away
Stop your suicidal faking!
Oh, you're so persecuted

You oughta know!
You oughta know!
You oughta know!!
