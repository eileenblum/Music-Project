Is this what you are?
Is this what you have become?
Reflections of your demise

All the things
Made for kings
You'll find them here

Your people, too
They'll bleed for you
You've made that clear

Look one time at your reflection
A broken looking glass what you've become

We all wonder what's in the conscience of the king
Does he think of the dead or the heroes gone?

Has he a life does he think of everything?
Is he hurt by the word does he rule on the edge?

Placate the sinners
Vanity is all around you
Blood leaves stains for life

All the men
They can't defend
Your stratosphere

Suddenly
Out from the calm
You feel the fear

Another glance at your reflection
The looking glass will now look back at you

Sire do you know what it is to be alone?
Can you ever be yourelf? Is it hard to be?

What is Heaven like? What's it like to live your life?
Is it everything it's all made out to be?

Sovereign we're alive and we're here to save your life
Tell us what to do here, your majesty

Should we weild the sword? Should we fight for you my Lord?
What's the matter, paramount, can't you speak?

We all wonder what's in the conscience of the king
Does he ever think of us? Does he hear our song?

Regal do you know what it is to be alone?
We will always pray for you in your kingdom on the edge
