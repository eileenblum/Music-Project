Was like I walked inside your mind
A darkened place with no windows
Was like through you I saw me

A gaping hole inside
The words never come out right
We must leave this room, take my hand and...

Come fly away, at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here

And the shadows fading
The mysteries upon my wall
Are there any angels anywhere?
I hear the cries all the time
Baptized by fire, in the holy light...

Come fly away, at last forever
Heaven can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
And all you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here

We can be healed
And we can be sacrificed, I know
(I know)
We can be healed
And we can be sacrificed, I know

Come fly away, at last forever
Heaven can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands....

Do I hear you laughing now?
Is that a sword I see?
This saga has an ending after all
Endless halls...It's so hard to see the answers
Burning dreams...A life for me, you are falling....

Come fly away, at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
Come fly away, at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
