It's time again
Fate demands that I think again
About my life and how it feels to be all alone
And the wizard of my mind
Oracle of all that's mine
Comes from deep inside
In a closet-size world of golden stories

This is...
This is my Imaginarium
This is...
This is the heart that pumps the golden blood

Where to? I don't know

This is...
This is my Imaginarium
This is...
This is the vent of hate, pain, and love
Stay awhile? I don't know

Come in, step inside my son
Do you see all that could have been?
Do you fear what you see my friend?
Do you have the heart to return again?
Do you?

Come in, step inside my son

Can you imagine staring at unreality, immortality?
Breaking away from all that used to be
And it's not even a dream
Or like anything that I've ever seen
You just close your eyes and the world is in your mind
It's a scary place to be

Here it comes!
Here it comes!
Here it comes!

This is...
This is my Imaginarium
This is...
This is the place where all the dreamers come

Stay here? I don't know

This is...
This is my Imaginarium
This is...
This is a world of death, fear, and love

Stay with me? I don't know

This is...
This is my Imaginarium
This is...
This is the place where all can be one
This is...
This is my Imaginarium
This is...
This is the vent of hate, pain, and love

Come here? I don't know!

Come in, step inside my son
Do you see all that could have been?
Do you fear what you see my friend?
Do you have the heart to return again?
Do you?

Come in, step inside my son

I'm back again
And what I've seen and done
Brings me down when I realize where I've been

Now that I've lived my fantasy
Life is no longer good enough to me
It's a scary place to be
