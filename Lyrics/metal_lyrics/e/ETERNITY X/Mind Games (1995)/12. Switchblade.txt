A million thoughts have passed me by, it's hard to keep the rhythm
Someone like me is gonna lick it clean I'm gonna fuck up the system
Who turned out the light, why are these chains wrapped around me
The pain breaks the soul, screw this man I'm gonna pay with blood

Cutting like a switchblade
Pray to your god tonight
Oh what a beautiful, beautiful day to die

They call these streets the animal zone
The slaughterman makes the killin'
I'm the saint with the balls to carry it out
Hey man what you lookin' at?

There ain't no reason for me, to give a damn about the blood I'm takin'
God without a cause, I'm sick and tired of everyone screamin' at me

Cutting like a switchblade
Pray to your god tonight
Oh what a beautiful, beautiful day to die
