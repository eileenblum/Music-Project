It's 10:00 AM, it's time to rise, make sense of the world again
My pain is too great to hide

Oh I feel it, yes I see it, almost as if time had saved the day
Not a matter I decide

But down here time goes slow
Down here time goes slow
The forgotten people and the dreamers that it left behind
Down here time goes slow
Down here time goes slow

Burning feeling, romantic pressures seem to be right here
And so the story goes
When I told of this, a casual look of care
But the feeling, doesn't lie, I was alone now:
Not a matter to decide to bare

And how do I fight against the feelings from an iron soul?
And how far did you come on the quest of the story told?

Down here time goes slow
Down here time goes slow
Acting on its captors as if they should never know
That down here time goes slow
Down here time goes slow

Now I'm feeling, slowly tortured, abiding to the task
Feeling captured, repeated torture I take off the sadist mask
Eternity (X) will you ever do me wrong?

Down here time goes slow
Down here time goes slow
Hoping that one day maybe the world will know
That down here time goes slow
Down here time goes slow
