Eyes so cold, hope so far away
The vision never goes away
A prison called my home, these same four walls
I wish I could turn back time

I know that feeling when all else is gone
And I will be here for you to take you within the final song
Despair and loneliness, as fleeting as a kiss fades with sound
And you can bask in the mist, emotionless, desire's going round and round

Memories set in, the sound of the wind
The tales of despair plague me
There's no way out of here, there's no light for me
I'm just a man with his dreams all gone

I know that feeling when all else has gone
And I will be here for you to take you within the final song
Despair and loneliness, as fleeting as a kiss whispers without sound
And you can bask in the mist, emotion bliss, desire's going round and round
Despair and loneliness, as fleeting as a kiss it fades without sound
And you can bask in the mist, emotionless, desire's going round and round

Light
I want to be near you
So come tonight
I can't see you
Fades without sound
