Do problems have endings where are you now
In my gravest hour of need
Soldier, all you do when I come to see you
Is point the way and tell me that I must believe

So crying deep inside I push into the shadows
Waiting for the end to show
Soldier, can you tell me even to sedate me
Who is my fortune and who the hell is my foe

And yes the star is rising higher
But must I pay with so much pain and the passage it changes
Moving its walls low enough to meet the ground, the passage it changes
Throwing at us darkness and forcing us to lose gained ground
And yes the star is getting clearer
But must I pay with the torment of my brain

As I make my stand and take the endless journey
I know I'm all alone again
Fighter of the faith, defender of the Journey
As I walk into the distance I see a full moon rising
And demons of the freedom make their stand
Having no choice I run the other way
Swearing not to give up and never to meet their demands

And yes the star is getting bluer
But still it seems far beyond my reach and the passage it changes
Moving its halls until there is no way out, the passage it changes
Throwing in decoys, always leaving that doubt
And yes the star is getting closer
And yes I do have to pay with far too much pain

Do problems have endings where are you now
In my gravest hour of need
Soldier, all you do when I come to see you
Is point the way and tell me that I must believe
