Imagine if there was a dream upon your stage
And all the time, a battle raged on within you
How could you end the war for good?
Amethyst valley bound engulfing every sound

Silence, never close to enough
Conquest maybe just too much
Insight in the clutches of heart and soul
Dreamscapes, you cannot outshine the firestorm

Struggle to see, night and day or, blackness fills the sky
Entrapped within the, blinded by the brightness of your eyes
All of the wasting, all of the wanting, beating down your walls
As your heart burns in the flames of the firestorm

Wait for the match to spark the flame
A way to find warmth and shelter once again
Fathom, tomorrow's yesterday
Apprehension, firestorm burns its way

Feel like sense has found its way, phoenix defiance that it's made
Waiting for our prophets hope to come, knowing that we'd surely die
In the firestorm

Struggle to see, night and day or, blackness fills the sky
Entrapped within the, blinded by the brightness of your eyes
All of the wasting, all of the wanting, beating down your walls
As your heart burns in the flames of the firestorm

Fighting a need to escape, and twisting these bars that I have made
Soldier, soldier, soldier, screaming to begin
Deep pain, it happens all again

Struggle to see, night and day or, blackness fills the sky
Entrapped within the, blinded by the brightness of your eyes
All of the wasting, all of the wanting, beating down your walls
As your heart burns in the flames of the firestorm
