Now's the time to hold the wind
The fire, the flames, the beast of prey
And the viper must feed

Hey you foolish one do you think it breaks my heart
To see, see you bleed after you tore at me: as the viper feeds

Think before you do, no, not you, you play to lose
And hell it's more than hurt, it's more than just a word
You can't just walk away: the viper will feed

Hold on to my hand we'll watch this once again
Eat, fill yourself oh viper
Sink your teeth into subjugated meat
Tear down their will please, viper

But now we can get through, my viper's near, all over you
My hate is spewing forth with lightning force, I must eat
So the viper has got to feed

Hold on to my hand we'll watch this once again
Eat, fill yourself my viper
Sink your teeth into sacrificial meat
Tear down their will please, viper

Now's the time to hold the wind
The fire, the flames, the beast of prey
And the viper must feed
