The smoky mist it hovered over the distant echoes of your voice flow through 
my soul
The wind blows silent like a mystery standing on a mountain top within my 
dream
They comfort me

And I don't know how I'm supposed to feel
None of this makes any sense at all to me
Lullabies sung by a distant memory, seems to hold me when I'm down
In this world of quiet sadness
Golden chalices filled with madness they come for me
Broken hearts lie all around me
A flowing pastel red upon the ground in the place I'm in

I gazed up into the night sky
Shivering cold from a brave man's destiny
As I opened up my eyes a strange light seemed to shine all over me

I heard this voice from nowhere surrounding all that wasn't there
Confirming all believing it was the time it said
You have to:

Crawl, crawl before you walk, walk before you run, run before you die
You have to feel, feel before you hurt, hurt before you learn, learn before 
you try

I feel like a wheel turning, turning on midnight - distorted - faces
I feel like a wheel lights up my eyes, happiness befalls me in some peculiar 
way
I feel like a wheel turning, turning on midnight

You have to:
Crawl, crawl before you walk, walk before you run, run before you die
You have to feel, feel before you hurt, hurt before you learn, learn before 
you try

Now the mist was clearing I could see the stars that lit the sky
I waited silent calls for a voice, a vision I could not find
Never heard but I wasn't jaded and that voice of reason never left my mind

You have to:
Crawl, crawl before you walk, walk before you run, run before you die
You have to feel, feel before you hurt, hurt before you learn, learn before 
you try

Oh no it's looking right at us but you don't have to like this
