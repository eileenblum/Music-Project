You don't starve through these fucking hardships

Of seclusion and hate.
My Soul is bloodsoaked and stained.

I still keep the Promise I gave.
I overcome my tears thoughen up and brave.

Even if I die alone.

And this is my Fate.
From the beginning to the grave.
I never betrayed myself.

Cos I'm down to concrete.
Cos I'm cold to concrete.
Cos I'm down to concrete.
Motherfucker I'm cold as concrete.

Watch you walking by.
you never shared a second of my fucking up life.
Show me off. Drag me Down.
You'll never know the innocence was mine.
You never gave a shit. Now matter how hard I tried.
I would change everything, if I could turn back time.

You don't starve through these fucking hardships.

Of seclusion and hate.
My Soul is bloodsoaked and stained.

I still keep the Promise I gave.
I overcome my tears thoughen up and brave.

Even if I die alone.

And this is my Fate.
From the beginning to the grave.
I never betrayed myself

Betrayed myself
Betrayed myself

Watch you walking by.
you never shared a second of my fucking up life.
Show me off. Drag me Down.
You'll never know the innocence was mine.

Cos I'm down to concrete.
Cos I'm cold to concrete.
Cos I'm down to concrete.
Motherfucker I'm cold as concrete.
