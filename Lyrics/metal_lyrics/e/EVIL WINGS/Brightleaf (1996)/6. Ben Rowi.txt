Walking slowly not to slide
on the rocks wet dew
Ben Rowi asked himself if he'd be able
of falling in a twilight world.

The branches, the different shades of green
the dead yellow leaves made him feel at home
laying in the underbrush,
his stare toward the sky
he talked with the silence

[Ben Rowi]
"I didn't hope you'd come"

[Brownie]
"I couldn't be missing,
it doesn't chanc every day
to meet a madman who wants
to know the small people"

You can find yoursekf in the kingdom of fairies
if you swallow a primrose

Everything had suddenly become queer
the rain poured upside down,
the pools reflected several moons
I sawheavenly creatures
dancing around, dancing around,
I joined them

[Brownie]
"Pay attention it's
a fay circle
don't dance with them,you might..."

[Ben Rowi]
"Don't worry , it's funny!"

"The dance was getting more and more frantic
I realized that time was flyin' away.
I was an old man"

During the dance time runs quicly,
minute last for years

[The Fairy]
"If you give me your eyes,
I'll open your mind
and you'll discover the secrets
of the small people"

I don't know how it came
I was made of steam
i was whirling in the air
I was ruling the skies

Maybe the fairy had joked me
maybe I was dead,ut death was not so bad
I was captured in a black hole
I woke up into the underbrush
I had finally fallen in a twilight world
but something seemed different
I was,now I am...

"I didn't hope you'd come!"
