Leaves are falling around

Drops of rain I smell the rain
keep on climbing
upon the misty mountain
waiting for...

Catch the wind if you're still alive
catch the flowers
the water and the sun
catch the wind if you're still alive.

Leaves are falling around

Dance all night
around the sleepy lake
waste no time,
the moon is high
the season of forever
waiting for...
