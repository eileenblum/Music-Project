And the time is still...

Rain and Mist embrace the cliff,
they hide the trees,
and cover the meadows.
Lady Shore is getting stroked
by the warm touch
of warping water.

And the time is still...

Reefs are dipping in the sea,
and seagulls sleep,
inside their shelters.
The almighty Wind
has flown away,
the air is dark, the sullen sky.

And the time is still...

I am sitting on the oak root
Oldman winter sist aside me
we look each other in the eyes
to seek something yet unknown.

And the time is still...
and the time stands still...

How many are
the colors of the ocean?
How many are
the songs of the birds?
All of my life was spent
in search for emotion.

And the time is still...
and the time stands still...

(as the smell of damp
grass crawls from the heart
of salty earth)

Runya's waiting at the harbour
for the journey of tomorrow,
but before I leave my land I need
to stay here for a while,
i will reap the sounds
and harvest the images
of the landscape
I will dream of once again...

I will dream them once again...
