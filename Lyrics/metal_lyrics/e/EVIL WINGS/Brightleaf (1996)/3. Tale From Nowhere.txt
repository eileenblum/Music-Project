It was a full moon night
one of those night that might go on forever.
The mist was dancing on the stone floor
of the strange medieval square
a silent wind entangled through the archways
was ringing with the sound of distant steps.
A minute or a century later
the man was in the middle of the space.
It was a special night
the strangest night from now until forever...

Then a cloud concealed the moon
and when the sky was lit again
the Mad Jester in a hood
stood beside the roving man
and though his eyes were shining
the man took on step back
because his lips were smiling
of a smile that chills to death.

[Jester]
"i was waiting for you
for it's time to begin
we've got something to do
I guess you know what I mean"

[Man]
"Why should I listen
to the idle things you say?
Tell me one only reason
or get out of my way!"

[Jester]
"It's written in your name
It's screaming from your voice:
You were born to play the Game
D'you still think you have a choice?"

So the man stood up in silence
while the jester took a band
then He wrapped it on his eyes and
put a gun in his hand.

[Jester]
"Within a century by now
I'll throw a coin in the air
from somewhere hereabout
you have to venture when and where.
It's the coin of Good and Evil
It's the Guardian of the Dreams
If you get it with your one shot
you'll be free"

The man was left alone
within his darkest world
and soon the deafening silence
was broken by a crowd

They crawled against his feet
they swarmed around his body
and all of them were blindfold
and covered with a shroud

"On your own you have no hope:
Give the weapon to your Pope!"
"Listen to a Nobel Prince:
I can do it with closed eyes!"
"I'm your favourite politician
don't you shoot without permission!"
"Need an expert? here I am
I'm a military man!"

The square was full of voices
and faces of undead
a hundred million noises
resounded in his head...

[Man]
"go away!Stay far from me!
You don't even let me be!"

Many years have passed by then
an still the night goes on
The full moon shines above the man
reflected in his gun
One day the man will break the spell
one day the man will see
that when he claimed to be himself
and when he strained to be himself
and when he chose to be himself
he was already free.
