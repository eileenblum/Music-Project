Once more I left the labyrinth of madness
I acted the part within the mirror.
Don't be mistaken
about what you are seeing
are you acting as yourselves
or are you wearing someone else's dress?
The curtain rises...

Only here, only now
I'm the one I want to be
at last I am myself.
Open your minds!

Come in, let the farce begin!
The curtain rises...
