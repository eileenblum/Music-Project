But still the rope goes on and on...

Sometimes i feel like a moth to a flame
we live, we die
and still we don't know why.

Sometimes i feel the stone of Cain
the rain, the sea
won't wash the blood on me.

I'm walking on the tight rope
bowing at the empty chairs
that shade into the darkness.
Is anybody out there?...

Sometimes you guess you're a prayer left undone
too thick to fly, too thin to fall and die

You're walking on the tight rope
like a thousand times before
surrounded by the silence.
You're walking on the tight rope
surrounded by the wall
of a thousand bolted doors...

...I used to dream we'd meet one day
and find a place called home
but still the rope goes on and on...
Do we live to walk alone?

I'm walking on the tight rope
like a thousand times before
surrounded by the silence...
You're dancing on the tight rope
don't know what you're fighting for.
Do we live to walk alone?
