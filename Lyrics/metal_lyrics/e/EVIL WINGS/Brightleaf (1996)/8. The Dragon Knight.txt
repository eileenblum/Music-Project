The Dragon Knight will be as one with the Dragon
The Dragon Knight will fly as the Dragon
He will skim the night woods with eyes of Ithil
He will oversoar the Oceans, beyond the Gates of Twilight

The Knight will dwell in the Wings of Evil
The Knight will walk beside the Fire and the Storm
He will hold the Might of Anor
He will know the Ancients Wisdom

Those of you who will master the Power of the Dragon,
Those of you who will claim to be a Dragon Knight,
Those of you will earn to ride the Eternal.
