[Oracle]:
"Lay your head, fall asleep,
find the door to my dreams,
and see the mistress of the silent sea."

[Wise Man]:
"Cast in an everlasting now,
far beyond the Rainbow
and deep inside your heart.
Lost among the holy walls of fire,
looking for the temple of the silent dreams.
the time has come to see the unseen,
to find the one.

Never throught I'd ever come so far,
rising from the darkness
to the frontiers of the sky.
Passing throught the guardian of Sapphire,
staring at the doorstep of the silent dreams.
The time has come to see the unseen,
to find the one.

Can't believe I'm standing
on that shore tonight,
staring at the mirror of her eyes,
dreaming about music floating
like a sorcery, on silent wings.

Caught between two heartbeats
of a butterfly,
trapped within a cold and angry world.
Elorah whispering the words
of self oblivion,
born to be the mistress of the sea...

Breath another consciousness inside,
eve of new beginnings
like a mighty wind of life,
now I am the master of my guide,
now i am the master of the silent sea!

The time has come to dream my dream,
to be the one,
and all I've seen,and all I've done,
are part of me,the silent one."
