[PRELUDE:]
While the time spirit is getting away
and you seek confusion
and it takes you far away;
you can see the writing on the wall
and now you're in a land
never seen before.

No voices only pain so deep inside
and while the Exodus Angel
overlooks the sky,
his eyes stand for all the mankind
and only a tired and deaf wind passes by...

[INQUIRER:]

[Man]
"Now King of darkness you tell me truth,
and no disguise for hell fire
burns in my soul.
Torture for m but now
i stand in front of you
and I'll find the Reaper
who made the worold fall"

[Angel]
"Your lips send strong words as stones,
I feel that you're chilling to the bones.
But why don't you hear the endless rhyme,
Why seeker of reason do you
want the Reaper of Time?"

[Man]
"I swallowed the pill of disillusion
and I know the hypocrisy,
the taste of reclution."

[WHEN THE NIGHT HIDES THE MOON:]

[Angel]
"Your believes are like tears in the rain,
you came from the light
to the darkness way...
I'm looking at the shadow of a dead man,
so I will take you where the Reaper stands."

They escape from within,
they break the wall close in,
no one dares to enter here
where a day is a year...

[THE REAPER OF TIME:]

They see an old woman alone,
she's beyond a cell of stone.
She pronounces an old sing-song,
her delights come and go.

[THAT FATE IS BLIND:]

[Angel]
"Look at her blind eyes
just to see a glimpse of light.
This woman is the Reaper of Time,
but come with me and leave her behind..."

So he knew the void meaning,
he saw the hystory of man,
of man screaming,
and still and quiet,disillusioned mind,
for he knew the Fate is blind...
