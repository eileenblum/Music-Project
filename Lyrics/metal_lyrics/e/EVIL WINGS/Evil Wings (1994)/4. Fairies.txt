Look at the shades that crawl on the bed,
those are the flames
of the living and the dead.
They call me by name and empty myself,
they promise me Heaven
with fire made of Hell.

Now I know my leaving time
has come, my last hour,
iin a desperate need for more,
all of my life was nothing
but steps on the shore, and the sea
is tiding up until the end...

Where is the stregth
which dwelt in my hand,
I'm lost through the land
of the living and the dead.

Dancing with the Fairies
in my eyes, one last time,
while they're taking me to the Door,
nobody knows the streets
where I'll wander and go in the cold,
and maybe then I'll live again...
I'll live again...
