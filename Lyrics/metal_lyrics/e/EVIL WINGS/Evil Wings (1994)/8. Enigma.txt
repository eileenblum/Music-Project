[PROLOGUE:]

Drippingon the forest of neverending fear...
Shegazes at the winter,holy silence,
withwide emerald eyes.
Andshe sits,and she waits,
andshe cries without a noise.
Whilethe timeless snow keeps falling
onthe roots upon her face...
Softand cold covering her ivy necklace,
coveringeverything like eternal oblivion.
Andshe sits,and she waits,
andshe cries without a noise,
andshe dream...

[DREAMOF THE VOLCANO:]

Avision out of madness
ofhellish fire and stream
whilethe thunder in the Earth
isthe mighty scream of anger
ofancient forgotten Gods.

(Red Apocalypse above him)

Whilethe solitary old man/not a word,
slowlytries to climb the Mount
ashe bends beaneth the years weight,
ashe reaches for the goal,
hethrows away his garments.

Nearthe bloody river stream
there'sa strange light in his eyes
anda quiver of emotions
whenthe white hair catches fire...

Andhe's getting nearer still,
andthe sweating of his brow
starsto sizzle upon his body,
butthe stare is still exulting.

Whilethe solitary old man.../not a word,
ashe dives into the flame,
ashe jumps into the fire...

[DREAMOF THE HUMAN CHESSBOARD:]

He'sjust a little pawn in the middle of the
sacredhuman Chessboard...

Withblack and white emotions,
inblack and white squares.

Heebony bishop stands in front of him,
thehate each other
butthey cannot touch...

[Bishop]:
"Whilepawn, your failed
tochoose you colour!
Forours will be the final victory,
throghyou may fight
withcleverness and honour,
perhapsthe one who'll take your life is me!"

[Pawn]:
"Ilove my lily clothing,
andI don't fear your brand;
youjust deserve an only promise:
I'llkill you if I can!"

Thenight falls slowly on the battlefield
hidingthe World within the shades,
theblack time keeps on crawling
tothe white time of the day...

...Asudden touch on the shoulder,
asudden hissing stab,
somebodyfalls at the pawn's feet,
leavingblood on the palm of his hand...

Andhe shouts when he sees the colour,
theunseen shiny Red...
Andhe shouts when he hears the laughter
ofthe one that should be dead!

[Bishop]:
"Whitepawn, white pawn,
whathave you done?
Haveyou wakened from your dream?
Somewherein a black and white hell,
somebodyawaits for you,
foryou killed the lily Queen..."

He'sjust a little pawn in the middle of
thesacred human Chessboard...

[DREAM OF THE MIRRORS:]

Ameaningless extent of broken mirrors
eachwith a broken image in its face,
andeveryone is different from the others,
ansshines within his frame...

Apicture of a man on a volcano
forgottenin the corner of the view,
thelight and shady vision of a chessboard
hiddenthrough and through,
andlaying on a thousand other pictures
thebiggest mirror dims
withmeaningless extent of broken mirrors
inthe landslide of dream...

[EPILOGUE:]

Wavingon the forest of neverending fear.
Thegentle snow has covered with a mantle
herpale and precious face...

Andshe sits, and she waits
forthe time of blooming life...

Whenthe flower sealed inside her
ina dewy crimson dress
willunfold and watch the Sunlight
andthe world outside her head...
