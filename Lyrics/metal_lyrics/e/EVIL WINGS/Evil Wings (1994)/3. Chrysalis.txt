Sweat upon my brow in this timeless night,
sudden feelings running through my veins
shroud the torture and the pain.

I remember now,everything combines,
all the flesh I've been enfettered in,
all my true self hidden in my skin.

They trapped me again,
the tried to get me stained.
Beast is my name and Beast is what I'll be.

Watch me as i free my velvet shining wings
in the heart of Midnight.
