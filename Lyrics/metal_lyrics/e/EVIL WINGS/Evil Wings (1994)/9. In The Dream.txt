Yesterdayi had a strange dream:
rebornfrom the ashes of ground
therewas a phoenix spreading his wings,
andhe was flying after the storm of Dawn.

Justa shadow in a desert land;
iwas looking at my hand
holdingmy memories,
andevil eyes staring
throughsad walls of debris.

Chainswere stronger than before
Iheard voices of his soul:
"I'mfantasy, so let me be!"
Hewas trapped in the gates of dream...

He'sdrowning in tears,in the dream...
He'sstanding in fear,in the dream...
He'sdrowning in fear,in the dream...

Thismorning when i awoke
theSun was rising,the day broke.
Iwas in my dream room and now I'm sure:
thephoenix will do come soon...

Chainswere stronger than before
Iheard voices of his soul:
"I'mfantasy, so let me be!"
Hewas trapped in the gates of dream...

He'sdrowning in tears,in the dream...
He'sstanding in fear,in the dream...
He'sdrowning in fear,in the dream...
