I feel the rain on my back
a lear sky within my inner self.
Grey clous cast darkness on my heart,
i need the sinlight in my eyes.

Unfold your wings agaist the stream,
cleft in the sky, rise to the Sunlight.

If I could only let them know,
each one is all and none's alone.

You're wasting your claws
in this fucking fight
amongst hopeless souls,
you're wasting your time
in this filthy swamp...
you pride begins to revive!

Unfold your wings agaist the stream,
cleft in the sky, rise to the Sunlight.

You can fly high and high
to reach the bravest of your dreams
I've found the place where
my soul's roaming free
here I'll dwell, I won't return no more...
