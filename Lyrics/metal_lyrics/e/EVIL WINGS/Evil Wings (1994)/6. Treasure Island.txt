Clouds far high in this summer Sky,
steady wind blows in the sails.
Straight beyond that close Horizon,
Trees grow green in my hidden Island.
Soon the Sunset then the night,
and the waxing Moon will rise.
At the harbour of my Land
merry people are shouting laughs.

Bones scream freedom from the black
of my high-hoisted Flag.
My Evil Wings clear free my path
leading to the Treasure Island.

Far behind us battle memories,
taste of salt chokes my throat.
Sugar cane spirit of my cellars
will this evening warm our souls.

From the Skull Cliff I'll watch,
as the dances join the shores.
Fire will shine in my proud eyes,
standing on the Treasure Island.

"Runya my vessel and I
sailed across the four Ghostly Seas"

Clouds far high in this summer Sky,
steady wind blows in the sails,
straight ahed my Vessel heading
rising trees of the Treasure Island.
