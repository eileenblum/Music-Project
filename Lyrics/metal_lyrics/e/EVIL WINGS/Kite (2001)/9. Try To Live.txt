Wake up,wake up now;
let's fight with the tide
Until the end
we can hold out...

Try to live, 'cause it's time to live:
it's such a shame to waste your time
Try to live;stand up and breathe:
it's such a shame
to waste your days like this!

This is your lifeline;
make up your mind
Can you feel the sun?
the spring has come...

Try to live, 'cause it's time to live:
it's such a shame to waste your time
Try to live;stand up and breathe:
it's such a shame
to waste your days like this!
