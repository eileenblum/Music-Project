Welcome to the New Millennium
take your seat,enjoy the show
I guarantee you won't believe your eyes

We got Mother Nature stripping naked,
Adolf Hitler's brand new clones
and Christ may call to let us know he's fine

Man, we're goin' insane!
Are we losin' our brains?

Teachers,preachers,politicians
talking 'bout a "new transition"
no-one has a slight idea where to

Win more money,win new cars
to win more friends and win more love
but what about that gun if you should lose?

Man,we're goin' insane!
Are we washin'our brain?

God must be out on a date;
we're spilling beer on His carpet
on this New Millennium night...

Welcome to the biggest party;
everybody's in the street
like foolish cattle driven to the shed

Hug your children, kiss your wife;
it's time fof biding them good-night,
and checking porno sites within the Net

Man,we're goin' insane!
Are we stormin' our brains?

God must be out on a date;
we're pissing into His garden
on this New Millenium night...

God must be out on a date;
we're spilling beer on His carpet
on this New Millennium night...

...Sorry for the carpet.
