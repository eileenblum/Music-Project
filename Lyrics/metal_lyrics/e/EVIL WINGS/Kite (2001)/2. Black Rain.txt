Black rain keeps falling down
on the concrete of this ugly town
and it seems that everything
in stained forever

Dull noise of a billion taps
like poison drops in a coffee cup
and the sunlight is a dream
I can't remember

It's too late
for another bedtime story
All the demons are awake
while the sentinels are snoring out there
It's too late
even for a rescue call
so baby here we dive,here we slide
here we fall
just like black rain...

Black rain keeps haunting me
it runs on glass like fingertips
with its radioactive marks
of evolution

Uncanny symphony
through earth and sky and stormy sea
have we come to find
the permanent solution

It's too late
for another bedtime story
All the demons are awake
while the sentinels are snoring out there
It's too late
even for a rescue call
so baby here we cry,here we drown
here we fall
just like black rain...
