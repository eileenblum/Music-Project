Lonely Star was just a shy boy
from the wrong side of town
but he was made of music
and needed to sing it loud

So off he took with a guitar
and with an old bag full of dreams,

facing the world alone and free,
singing a different song
for anyone;
the look of sorrowful angel,
a smile that will never forget
the cold
of a night(in South End)...

He never took the road back
though there were times so bad;
maybe some day he will happen
to walk down a City Strand

and cross a guy with a guitar
carrying an old bag full of dreams,

ready to risk it all like him,
singing a different song
for anyone;
the face of a slovenly angel,
a brother who'll never forget
the pain of a night in South End...

...another cold night
in South End...
