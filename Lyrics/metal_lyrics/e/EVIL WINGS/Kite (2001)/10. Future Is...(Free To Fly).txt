The future is now,
it's running in our hands:
a fine orchestral tuning
before the very dance

The future is here:
there's always one more page
to write a brand new statement
forgetting old mistakes

So,how does it feel
to know that you can choose your own
direction?
How does it feel
to find out heaven hates to much perfection?

This is your Time
This is your Place
The mighty wind of life
keeps blowing in your face:
This is the Chance
you don't have to waste...

The future is free,
a fruit-tree meant for shaking;
the breathing of a world
forever in the making

and sometimes I think
it's just ahead of dreams:
if we can dream them strong enough
they'll get reality

So,how does it feel
to know that every step will lead you
farther?
How does it feel
to see your footmarks followed by
another?

This is your Time
This is your Place
The mighty wind of life
keeps blowing in your face:
This is the Chance
you don't have to waste...

...I'm a kite
as the time goes by
sometimes I dream
you cut my string
and let me free to fly...
