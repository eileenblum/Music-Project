You cut me deep
you watch me bleed
and then you cut again

I never show.
The pain I feel.
I keep it from my self.

But you'll never get.
deep enough inside of me.
the very thing you want.
lies deeper,can't you see?

You take new pins
you stick them in
and still you're not content

'cause you'll never dig
far enough inside of me;
the very thing you need
lies deeper,can't you see?

No,you'll never get
deep enough inside of me:
the prize you're killing for
lies deeper,can't you see?
