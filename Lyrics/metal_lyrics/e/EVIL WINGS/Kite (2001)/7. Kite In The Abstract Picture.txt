I'm a kite
flying in the sky
Watch my shadow dancing
like a dot against the sun

Feel the wind
running on my skin,
lighter than a feather
as I'm turning upside down

And the world below,
seen from here,
it always looks so small...
doesn't seem to matter at all.

And the Human Show
of hopes and fears
doesn't seem to matter at all,
my dear,I am a kite

I'm a kite
waving' up so high,
poetry in motion
with the sunshine in my eyes

Cloud-shapes change,
minutes last for days,
captured in a blue spell
I get lost within the haze.

And the world below,
seen from here,
it always looks so small...
doesn't seem to matter at all.

And the Human Show
of hopes and fears
doesn't seem to matter at all,
my dear,I am a kite

I'm a kite
as the time goes by
sometimes I dream
you cut my string
and let me free to fly...
