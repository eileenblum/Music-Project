Watching the end of a day
streets and city walls vanish into grey
The night is a whisper;
it spreads like a hand
over this world...

Follow the tide of your emotions,
running your river to the ocean...

When the earth is still
feels like the is nothing left to feel,
all the universe's inside your head
Over the rooftops
the stars begin to dance;
it takes just one glance
to feel petty...

Follow the tide of your emotions,
running your river to the ocean...

Should the world around you fall,
should you have to change it all,
always find the courage to hold on...
