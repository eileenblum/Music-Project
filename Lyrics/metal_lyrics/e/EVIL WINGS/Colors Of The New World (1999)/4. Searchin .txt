Feeling cold
flying to the bottom of our soul
waiting for this night
emptied like sand
from a sandglass.

I'm searchin' for the silence
inside of me
to find a shelter in a corner of my soul.

Threads of throughts
are getting distant
to the centre of the universe
like bams from a star
and I stay safe and sound.

I'm searchin' for the silence
inside of me
to find a shelter in a corner of my soul.

I broke the mirrors and at last
I could see myself as a man.
