The House of Cries and Laughter
is standing on the reef
surrounded by the wet fog
and the silence
The tall and slender spires
are shining like a jewel
in the setting sun
It doesn't matter where you
come from or  when it all began;
now the Final Quest is through:
the House awaits you...

Beyond the open door there's nothing in the hall
but the dust upon the floor and a mirror on the wall
with something wrong inside it:
it shows a different place,
and the visage of a Stranger
instead of your own face

[You]
"Can you see outside the mirror?
Are you bound to stay in there?
I will take you to the real world,
if you show me the way..."

[Stranger]
"You must be a joker of a fool:
how do you plan to set me free
when the queer reflection's you
and the very man is me?"

[You]
It's a dirty lie!
Keep your fake and flat reality,
and the Devil by your side!"

[Stranger]
"Then you must be blind
or a pray to your insanity,
for heaven knows I'm right!"

Then a puppet Angel comes
losing stuffing from his head,
with dirty wings of patched wool
hanging by some threads;
and the squeaking rusty root
of a Devil does the same,
each inside his private Mirror,
each inside a separate frame...

...They keep staring at you
dancing in their silver screens
with eyes as hard as rusty nails
that wound you deep inside
with their silent screens...
the House is cold and dim
as you shiver and wail
and still you don't know why...

[Angel]
"So you want to know the meaning
of the morbid sights you see,
no matter what the price will be..."

[You]
"I only wish to understand:
tell me what to do;
tell me who I am!"

[Devil]
"Yet i have more than a feeling
that you won't rely on me,
no matter what the price will be..."

[You]
I only try to understand:
tell me what to do;
tell me who I am!"

[Devil]
"First of all you're dreaming
for only when you sleep
your mind has got the heart to face reality
The truth you keep concealing
is more than you can keep;
it's poison in the nightmares of Humanity"

[Angel]
"We're all trapped within our Mirror
we're all lost inside ourselves
(as it's always been),
and to touch the cold glass border
is to find our Secret Hell:
Welcome In..."

Every night you dream that Dream
and just before you get it
you're woken up by your own scream,
and each time you forget it...
Perhaps some day you'll stand so near
the surface of the Mirror
to mist it up with one deep breath;
perhaps it'll be Tomorrow...
