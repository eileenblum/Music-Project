Starship,yur wings are shining
Starship,you silver lining
is daring the darkness,
the cold and the silence;
what a trip into the Never...

Out there,
looking for meaning
out there
or just my heart beating...

Starship, the night is colder
Starship,I'm growing older
by slowly realising
I travelled inside me:
will this trip go on forever?

Out there,
looking for freedom
out there
or just a deep breathing...

Starship,
gone through the Big Sky
Starship,
your trail is my Goodbye,
Goodbye
