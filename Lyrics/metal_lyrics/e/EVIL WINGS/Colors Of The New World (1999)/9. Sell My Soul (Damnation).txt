Maybe you should tell me
that what I did was wrong,
messing with the Devil
to give me what I'm longing for
Velvet and golden rings,
fast car and kisses,
everybody staring up at me...
Sell my soul
Did you ever lose control
thinkin's of the things that we leave behind,
all that we're missing?
Everything is waiting there for you...
So,when I cross the stageline
He's always there with me
to show me what to do now,
to find a new way to exceed
Bright lights and photographs,
sweet pills and parties,
everybody keeps his eyes on me...
Sell my soul
Did you ever feel so cold
dreaming of the Sun and the Summertime?
Just stretch your fingers
anything is waiting there for you...

Sell my soul
I will sing the mighty Call of my Master
He's watching you,my friends,
He needs more puppets:
let the Freedom Strings get down on you...
