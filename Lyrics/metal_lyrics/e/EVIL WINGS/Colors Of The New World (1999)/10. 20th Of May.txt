So,there you are
in front of me
with a new world
shining in your eyes
I look at you
and all I see
is rescued from beneath
the dust of time.

The scent of the evening
the swallows in the air
when anything was rare
and it all was different...
The fall of the red leaves
the thrill of the chimes
when anything was mine
and now it's your time...

Just close your eyes
and dream for me
the dreams that have been
hidden in my mind
You will be Sunshine
when I am cold
You are my Story,
don't remain untold.

The scent of the evening
the swallows in the air
when anything was rare
and it all was different...
The fall of the red leaves
the thrill of the chimes
when anything was mine
and now it's your time.
