Rivers of emotion
flying free to the sun;
Bright and cosmic visions
waking up my consciousness.

Leaving all your throughts behind your shoulders,
far beyond the barrier of your senses
open up your eyes and watch the

Colors Of The New World...

Everything is written,
we live on, n'n' we live as one
Stars and Moons and Planets
will remais to show us the way.

Leaving all your throughts behind your shoulders,
far beyond the barrier of your senses
open up your eyes and watch the

Colors Of The New World...
