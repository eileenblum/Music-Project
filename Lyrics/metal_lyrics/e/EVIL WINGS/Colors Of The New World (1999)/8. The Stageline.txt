Whisper my name
and I'll be back on the stage again
here to go on with the show
Lost in my play
I will be acting my part again
screaming the words that you know.

But pay attention:
never cross the line between us,baby,
or you will see
the master of this world is me,
and you will be
my host for evermore...

Look at my friends
they're coming back to perform again
ready and aiming at you
See how they dance
their funny ballet will never change
waving in time till it's through.

But pay attention:
never cross the line between us,baby,
or you will see
that anything you fear is me,
and I will steal
your soul for evermore...
