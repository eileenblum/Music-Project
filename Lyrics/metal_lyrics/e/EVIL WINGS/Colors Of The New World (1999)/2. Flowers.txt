This is my prayer
or just despair
that's what I need now
that's what I want now
Flowers on your hair
Lay back and groove
waterfall of flowers
so all we got
wings and evil side by side

Flowers in my hands

Inside your fairy garden
I've gotta be free
sweet feeling
this will be the last

Flowers,or just illusion?
