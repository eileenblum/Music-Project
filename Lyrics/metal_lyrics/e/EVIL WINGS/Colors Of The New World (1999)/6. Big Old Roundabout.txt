Whispering water
did we miss it all?
Feverish sunlight
tell me the truth:
are we foolin' ourselves, now?

All of our lives spent searchin' for
something ready to happen
but do we search in vain?

Moon in the dark night
can you answer me?
Shivering north wind
show me the way
the way of breakin' the spell,now

Just like a Big Old Roundabout
full of beautiful horses
put there of rust in vain...

Maybe we're living by mistake,
nothing's ready to happen;
Maybe the Big Old Roundabout
is the Dream of a Madman,
but we will search the same...
