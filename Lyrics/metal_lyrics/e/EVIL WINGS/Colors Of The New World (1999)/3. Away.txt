Lost in the night
never turning back
Holding the steering-wheel
with both hands
Deep down beneath all your loneliness
I hear your body,it's screaming:

Away from the pain
away from the rain
Away from the sorrow
I'm making my way
just leaving the world behind me
and keeping it far from my back
'cause that's what it takes to be free...

All your life
full of emptyness
'n' all of your memories
speed up with you
Under your car dipped into the black
your hear the highway, it's screaming:

Away from the pain
away from the rain
Away from the sorrow
I'm making my way
just leaving the world behind me
and keeping it far from my back
'cause that's what it takes to be free...
