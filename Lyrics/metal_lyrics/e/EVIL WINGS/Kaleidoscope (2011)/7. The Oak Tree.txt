Springhtly and warm
the raindrops are falling down
pouring on the wide wood
in the maze of greenery

Flowers and shoots
are dancing the dance of life;
birdies run for cover
underneath the sodden leaves.

The Oak Tree is watching it all,
King upon his throne
Everything keeps changing,
and yet standing still;
he knows and stands alone...

After the rain,
the bees and the butterflies
hover through the branches,
with their queer trajectories.

Quick as a wink,
a squirrel is running down
sniffing at the new scents,
in a bright burst of life.

The oak tree is watching it all
from the greeny dome
Through so many seasons,
the chill and the heat,
he's always stood alone...

The Oak tree is watching it all;
one more year has gone...
Sheltered by his leafage,
a new oak will spring;
he'll be no more alone...

All the nature, wild and free,
keeps on whispering its tune
in a hydroponic greenhouse
orbiting around Neptune...
