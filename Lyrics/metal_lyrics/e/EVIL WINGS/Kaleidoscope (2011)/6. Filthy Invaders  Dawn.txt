They came from out of nowhere,
a distant galaxy;
we didn't even know
'bout their existence.

A little dying planet:
they ravaged everything,
and moved to further worlds
within their system.

A trail of mass destruction
just anywhere they go,
bringing the mark
of violence and madness.

We came across the vanguard;
the shot without a word:
not even an attept
to set a contact.

They are coming
like a bad dream at night;
cruel eyes shining
as our little ones cry.
Now we know what's hatred,
ugliness and fright:
the most terrible days have begun,
on the Filthy Invaders' Dawn.

Across the barrer deep space
and on a thousand worlds,
the battle rages on
in all its fury.

Their weapons ar so deadly
no sign of mercy at all:
these monsters came to smash
and spoil the beauty.

They are coming,
and we fight to survive;
cruel eyes shining,
as our bastions boom high.
Blaze of burning planets
lightening up the skies;
if we fall,any hope will be gone,
on the Filthy Invaders' Dawn.
