The feverish flaming sunset
is staining with its blood the far horizon;
the burning waves are running to the shoreline
where they die whispering at his feet.
Seven moons high in the sky;
a small space-ship waits nearby;
an old man cries in silence on the white cliff;
his tears run off his face into the sea.

[Man]
"I spent my whole life
searching for an answer:
the meaning of the very Vital Flame.
It's time for me
to give up and surrender:
I spent my days in vain".

[Sea]
"The meaning of a gift
is in the way you give it;
the sense of every life
is in the way you live it.

You can turn back
the Clock of inner time
feeling your life has just begun
if you just see and feel:
everything is different
yet everything is One"

Now the old man's face is smiling,
while the Clock turns back to youth.
The man is wimming
in the purple ocean.
The man is you.
