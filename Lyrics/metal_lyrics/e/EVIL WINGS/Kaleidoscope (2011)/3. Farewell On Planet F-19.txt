Is this the end?
Is this what was meant to be?
You're staring down in silence,
but your thoughts are somewhere else...

Just like fine sand
that runs down my fingertips,
the star-wind led you to me,
now the star-wind takes you back...

And you know the pain that i feel
just behind my smile,
standing at the trap-door
with nothing to say
I watch you pass me by...
I know it well,
I guess it was meant to be:
a Spacer says "Forever",
but there's always one more trip...

And you know the pain that I feel
deep inside my soul;
standing in this space suit,
my eyes to the sky,
I have to let you go...

And I know the pain that you feel
as you meet my eyes:
staring from the cockpit
at all that you love,
you have to say goodbye...
