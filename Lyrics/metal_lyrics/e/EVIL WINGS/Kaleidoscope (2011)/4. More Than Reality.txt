Let me cyber-hold you
with sexy virtual machine arms;
you will show seductively
your brand new software charms

We will choose the setting:
"Caribbean night dot four";
I like the way the pseudo-waves
run fast across the shore

Everything's just perfect
as I set my eyes on you
(hold on,let me fix the blue)...

This is more than reality:
this is living in the Dream
It doesn't matter where or who:
it just can't be more real,
so let's down together
in this GodPuter Heaven,
my little morbid Eve...

Holograms and fractals
are glowing endlessly;
what a fading memory,
the wires tapped in my skin

and it makes no difference
if you're forreal or not:
who cares if you're a program file,
as long as you're so hot!

Everything's just perfect
as you lead me to the bed
(hold on,let me fix the red)...

This is more than reality:
this is living in the Dream;
I swear some day I'll find the way
to do without these strings,
and live here forever
leaving behild the nutshell,
the hollow man called me.
