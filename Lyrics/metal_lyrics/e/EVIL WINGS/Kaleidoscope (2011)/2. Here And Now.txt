Time to wake up:
the world's waiting there for you;
twelve million different colours
to chase and dive into.

Why d'you quit it
and stay just by yourself?
No sigh of doors and windows:
you've built your prison cell.

(So,listen honey)

Life is here;
here and now :
you cannot stop this planet
from spinning round and round.

Life is here;
here and now:
the rhythm of your heartbeat
is worth twelve million stars.

You can't help it:
it all looks empty and wrong,
'cause things are always shitty
'n' there's nowhere you belong.

Stop this moaning:
you're wasting precious time,
and that is just the one thing
you mustn't leave behind.

Life is here;
here and now:
a flavour to be tasted,
don't leave it the denied.

Life is here;
here and now:
the whole world as we know it
may disappear tonight.

Use every minute,
every spark of light:
the whole world as we know it
may dissapear tonight.
