Kaleidoscope of stars,
of comets passing by,
and shining supernovae
in the darkest of the nights.

So many different worlds,
inhabited or not,
spinning around like marbles
on the floor mat of some God...

We are children of the sky,
kin to Space and Moons;
shall we listen to their tune?

Kaleidoscope of strings
throughout the Milky Way,
like delicate synapses
of a Universal Brain,

that dream amazing dreams;
each throught is made of light,
and travels in the blackness
to the edge of Space and Time...

We are children of the Sky,
kin to Space and Moons;
the whisper in our heartbeat...
We are children of the sky,
kin to Space and moons;
shall we listen to their tune?
