I've been sleeping here for day.
hope I die before my dreams drive me insane.
when you're not around I might let my guard down.
don't keep me waiting.
you can't understand my nightmares.
bad dreams are all that I can keep..
locking in a room where all my dreams come true.
scrape my mind off of the walls painted pretty blue.
collective thoughts fill my brain, but every night it's just the same.
don't keep me waiting.
you can't understand my nightmares.
bad dreams are all that I can keep.
you can't understand my nightmares.
don't you close your eyes to see.
(blindness is overwhelming.)
