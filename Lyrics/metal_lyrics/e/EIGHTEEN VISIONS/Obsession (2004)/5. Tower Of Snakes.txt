you told me no apologies but I'm sorry it couldn't cut the mustard and it's 
absurd.
hey, you turned the light off, you gave me darkness.
you sucked the blood right out of life.
are you running away from me?
are you running away from you?
you showed me what I should see, but I'm still blind and I can't breathe.
you swallowed pride like someone died.
you chewed it up and spit it out but no one's to be found now.
are you running away from me?
are you running away from you?
hey, what are you running away from?
you told me what I should see, but I'm still blind and I can't breathe.
are you running away from me?
are you running away from you?
