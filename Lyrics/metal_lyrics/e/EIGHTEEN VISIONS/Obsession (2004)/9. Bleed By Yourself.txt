I haven't met you lately.
I know it's been so long.
I haven't seen you lately, I know that you've done wrong.
think time has made you crazy.
your mind is oh so gone.
think time has more than raised me.
don't need you anymore.
shooting you inspiration.
bullets don't feel so good.
turning to desperation.
I always knew you would.
think time has made you crazy.
your mind is oh so gone.
think time has more than raised me.
don't need you anymore.
this is where you stand.
this is where you pray.
this is where you sit and this is where you lay.
I left you there to bleed by yourself.
you left me here to die alone.
think time has made you crazy.
your mind is oh so gone.
think time has more than raised me.
don't need you anymore.
