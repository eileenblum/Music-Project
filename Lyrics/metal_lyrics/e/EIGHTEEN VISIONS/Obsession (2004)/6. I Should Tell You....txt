I watched the falling rain splash upon your face.
I know those aren't your tears.
you know it's me and where I've been.
it's just circumstances.
don't let her down.
so I should tell you why it's so hard to tell you.
you know it's me and where I've been and the million words I'm thinking.
I burned my time today as I start to waste.
you were my one and only and now I don't know why.
you know it's me and where I've been.
it's just the circumstances.
don't let her down.
and I know what you're feeling tonight.
and I know for now you're mine.
I watched the falling rain splash upon your face.
I know those aren't your tears.
you know it's me and where I've been.
it's just the circumstances.
don't let her down
