close the book and turn the page.
exit players from the stage.
count the moons and stars but please stop fighting wars with me.
after all is said and done you still try.
after all is said and done you're not mine.
turn your back on all hope.
this sheep has shed his winter coat.
you send your notes and ranting.
this pigeon has hard times landing.
after all is said and done you still try.
after all is said and done you're not mine.
