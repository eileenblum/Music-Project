could you, maybe, stop this from happening?
I know it hurts but you don't have to walk away.
I don't know why I want to stop myself from feeling low.
I don't know why lies know my name and lies I show.
I don't know why I want to stop myself from feeling low.
I don't know why I even try.
I can't be that way when my life looks this grey so I let go.
I've got to leave it alone this time or I'll wallow in my mind.
I've got to leave it alone:
I can't be that way when my life looks this grey so I let go.
I don't understand why clouds sit on my head.
it looks like rain.
I feel shame.
