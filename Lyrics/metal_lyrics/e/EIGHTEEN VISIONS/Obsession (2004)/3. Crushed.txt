you could ease my pain.
you could bring the rain.
yet all these clouds have washed away so why does my life still seem grey.
you can't save me from yourself.
and I should put you in the grave.
these dead flowers aren't in bloom but still I picked them just for you.
you don't mean anything to me yes I say.
you can't save me from yourself.
why did you give up on me when I was young?
why did you give up on me from the moment I was born?
and I should put you in the grave.
you can't save me from yourself.
and I'm bleeding from you leaving.
you don't mean anything to me yes I say.
