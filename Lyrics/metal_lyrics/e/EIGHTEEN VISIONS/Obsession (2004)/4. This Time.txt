can I make this madness go away?
again I wake at 3am, can't lose these creeps inside my head.
reality seems far away and all my dreams will slowly fade.
the sun breaks the silence that the night divides.
the moon might be the perfect place for me to hide.
I can't stop my mind.
this time, my mind.
can I make this madness go away?
my mind to fade has turned the page cause dead and gone is where I lay.
the enemy in black and flame.
within this hell is where I play.
the sun breaks the silence that the night divides.
the moon might be the perfect place for me to hide.
I can't stop my mind.
this time, my mind.
this time on my side, the moon is alive.
it's time to resign the devil in my mind.
as darkness takes me to the brink of devastation:
I can't stop my mind.
this time, my mind.
I know that I'm close to finding my salvation.
