God help me save tomorrow from fear of darkest hour.
this world in pain, it's time to rise again.
this life is so called murder.
staring at angry horror.
don't want to live today when all I feel is pain.
and I pray that I would fall apart.
I know this world's the enemy.
you don't know what it's like and I don't think you even care.
you don't know what it's like and you've never ever even been there.
God help me save tomorrow from fear of darkest hour.
this world in pain, it's time to rise again.
my life is going under.
staring at angry horror.
don't want to live today when all I feel is pain.
and I pray that I would fall apart.
I know this world's the enemy.
you don't know what it's like and I don't think you even care.
you don't know what it's like and you've never ever even been there.
this life is so called murder.
staring at angry horror.
don't want to live today when all I feel is pain.
I know this world's the enemy.
