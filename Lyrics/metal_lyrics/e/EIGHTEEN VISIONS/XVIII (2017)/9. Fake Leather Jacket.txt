["Wild At Heart" sample:]
[Idiot Punk:] You look like a clown in that stupid jacket
[Sailor:] This is a snakeskin jacket! And for me it's a symbol of my individuality, and my belief in personal freedom
[Idiot Punk:] Asshole

You made a promise you just couldnÊ¼t keep
Said youÊ¼d make me famous, the year of the âv.â
But youÊ¼re just so epic full of shit
And I donÊ¼t wanna hear another word
Your arrogance, it makes me sick as I feel my stomach turn

And I donÊ¼t need a reason, I think youÊ¼re aware
Of all the hearts youÊ¼ve broken, but you donÊ¼t seem to care
So donÊ¼t you dare
Cause I think you know
DonÊ¼t you dare face me alone

One day I will rise and have my revenge
Your crown has been stolen
No more to defend
And youÊ¼re just so epic full of shit
A lesson that youÊ¼re gonna have to learn
Your ignorance, it makes me sick, but this time youÊ¼re gonna burn

And I donÊ¼t need a reason, I think youÊ¼re aware
Of all the hearts youÊ¼ve broken, but you donÊ¼t seem to care
So donÊ¼t you dare
Cause I think you know
DonÊ¼t you dare face me alone

Now itÊ¼s too late to walk away
ItÊ¼s time to settle the score
And now youÊ¼ve run out of time
Cause youÊ¼ve been equalized
Tongue tied without a lie to speak
Liar, sadist, corporate, rapist
IÊ¼ve got nothing to lose
Cause itÊ¼s all been taken from me
No longer will I be denied
(Liar, sadist, corporate, rapist)

And I donÊ¼t need a reason, I think youÊ¼re aware
Of all the hearts youÊ¼ve broken, but you donÊ¼t seem to care
So donÊ¼t you dare
Cause I think you know
DonÊ¼t you dare face me alone
