A single truth that we shared, our philosophy
We traveled far beyond
Imagination, the picture's taken
Immortalized in my mind
The ground is shaken, your grave awaken
Deep inside

You live again
Live again
You live, never far beyond the page
Broken pieces perfectly arranged

A life in total despair
Always hurt to breathe
You couldnÊ¼t carry on
Violation, a love forsaken
Now teeth are starting to grind
The ground is shaken, your grave awaken
Deep inside

You live again
Live again
You live, never far beyond the page
Broken pieces perfectly arranged

I know you suffered and we suffered the same
Can I deliver you, deliver you from the pain?
Stay inside me
We'll never forget the days
We made the most of our memories
Stay inside me
We'll never forget the days
We made the most of our memories
We made the most of our memories

So pure
Your passion, your pain
So pure
We keep your memory
We keep your memory
We keep your memory
We keep your memory
