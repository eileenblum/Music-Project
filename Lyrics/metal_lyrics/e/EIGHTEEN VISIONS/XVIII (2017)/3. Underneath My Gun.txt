[Intro - "They Live" sample:]
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass
And I'm all out of bubble gum

There is no mercy for what youÊ¼ve done
And no forgiveness underneath my gun
And it was only just a matter of time until I killed your pride
I killed your pride

Buried by the look in my eyes, by the look in my eyes

And you canÊ¼t take away what you donÊ¼t own
And you donÊ¼t own me I thought you should know

And it was only just a matter of time until I killed your pride
I killed your pride

(Buried by the look in my eyes, by the look in my eyes)

You donÊ¼t own me

I know the darkness, IÊ¼ve broken bones
IÊ¼ve been to hell and back but didnÊ¼t lose my soul
Yeah, you couldnÊ¼t strike me down
Yeah, I stand above you now
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

I know the darkness, IÊ¼ve broken bones
IÊ¼ve been to hell and back but I didnÊ¼t lose my soul
Yeah, you couldnÊ¼t strike me down
Yeah, I stand above you now
