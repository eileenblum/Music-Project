Still crucified
Still crucified
Still crucified

I've never been consumed
Never conformed like you

Still crucified

You once were a king, but you've become a pawn
Go!

You once were a king, but you've become a pawn
Now a slave yeah you've been so deceived
And oh what a crime that you're living a lie
When the truth was right there to be seen

Still crucified
Still crucified
Still crucified
