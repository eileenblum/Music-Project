["Gangs of New York" sample:]
I know your works
You are neither cold nor hot
So because you are lukewarm, I will spew you out of my mouth
You can build your filthy world without me

I will spit
Spit you out

I kill just to justify
Before I take
Yes I kill just to feel so alive
Yes I feel so alive

I could be the reason you canÊ¼t fight off your demons
Cause itÊ¼s just so fucking chemical
Mind has got you going
The needleÊ¼s got you showin' that you're just so fucking chemical

Spit you out
I will spit you out
Spit you out
I will spit you out

I will leave you here to die
Your soul in chains
Yes I kill just to feel so alive
Yes I feel so alive

Now IÊ¼ve got you thinking the shit has got you twisted
Cause itÊ¼s just so fucking chemical
High is getting low and sweats are getting cold
Because youÊ¼re just so fucking chemical

Spit you out
I will spit you out
Spit you out
I will spit you out

I am the one you see
That brings you to your knees
I am the one to behold
I am the fear inside
Now look into my eyes
ItÊ¼s time to lose your soul

You let it all just slip away
You didnÊ¼t know the price to pay

This is my war, this is the war I wage
This is my war, this is the war I wage

I will spit you out
I will spit you out
Spit you out
I will spit you out
