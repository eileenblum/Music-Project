Picture perfect with your rock cocaine
Smoking glass, ainÊ¼t got no shame

You never told me what you really were
Another lie, but now I see right through you
Sitting pretty. âLeast you thought you were
Until your walls came down and now I know your game

Picture perfect with your rock cocaine
Smoking glass, ainÊ¼t got no shame
I know youÊ¼ll end up on the floor
YouÊ¼re such a fucking disgrace yeah

You gave me a reason to hate
Gave me a reason to hate
Gave me a reason to hate myself for ever knowing you

You breathe while others die
AinÊ¼t that a fucking lie

Picture perfect with your rock cocaine
Smoking glass, ainÊ¼t got no shame
I know youÊ¼ll end up on the floor
YouÊ¼re such a fucking disgrace yeah

You gave me a reason to hate
Gave me a reason to hate
You gave me a reason to hate
Gave me a reason to hate
Gave me a reason to hate myself for ever knowing you
