By now thereÊ¼s nowhere to hide
Your lifeÊ¼s become a fucking waste of time
IÊ¼ve watched you slip, IÊ¼ve watched you fall from grace
IÊ¼ve watched you bend and now IÊ¼ll watch you break

You find the weakest mind
You force your way inside
Feeding upon their soul
Until they bleed no more

Too many times IÊ¼ve bled for you
Too many times IÊ¼ve tried
Too many times IÊ¼ve trusted you
Too many times you lied
IÊ¼ve watched you burn every bridge
I hope you know how to swim
Choke on the air you breathe
Too many times IÊ¼ve bled for you
YouÊ¼re just a fuckin leach

YouÊ¼ve got a fucking disease
The broken glass has brought you to your knees
IÊ¼ve watched you crash and now IÊ¼ll watch you sink
Your thirst for fame has put you on the brink

You find the weakest mind
You force your way inside
Feeding upon their soul
Until they bleed no more

Too many times IÊ¼ve bled for you
Too many times IÊ¼ve tried
Too many times IÊ¼ve trusted you
Too many times you lied
IÊ¼ve watched you burn every bridge
I hope you know how to swim
Choke on the air you breathe
Too many times IÊ¼ve bled for you
YouÊ¼re just a fuckin leach

This is a new kind of hell
This is a new kind of hate
This is a new kind of hatred

This is a new kind of hell
This is a new kind of hate
This is a new kind of hatred

You have broken the bond of friends
Now we witness your bitter end
