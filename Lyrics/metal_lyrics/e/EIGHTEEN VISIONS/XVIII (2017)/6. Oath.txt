Take your shame exposed for all to see
Your broken oath
Prosecuted
Judged and buried
Soul convicted

Torn apart exposed for all to see
Ripped to shreds
Now let the poison bleed

Your broken oath
Prosecuted
Judged and buried
Soul convicted

Made of stone so hard weÊ¼ll never break

And we will keep this oath

We keep this oath
We keep this oath

We keep this oath
We keep this oath
We keep this oath
We keep this oath

We keep this oath
