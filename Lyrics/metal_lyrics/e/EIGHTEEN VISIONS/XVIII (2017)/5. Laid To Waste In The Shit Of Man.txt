Raised in filth, the misery laid in slop, the race of man
[?]

I know IÊ¼ve been taken down this road before
If you could see what I have seen I think youÊ¼d want to choke
Is there anybody out there listening?
Can anybody hear me screaming now?
Now I'm bleeding out

If this is the end, where do I begin?
Do I leave all that IÊ¼ve ever know behind?
If this is the end, will I be born again?
Or will I self destruct by killing more than time?
If this is the end

Now I think IÊ¼m breaking down, but I want more
I wonÊ¼t give up, I can't give in, cause IÊ¼d hate to never know
I wonÊ¼t stop until my heart stops beating
IÊ¼m in a hole with no way out
Now IÊ¼m bleeding out

If this is the end, where do I begin?
Do I leave all that IÊ¼ve ever know behind?
If this is the end, will I be born again?
Or will I self destruct by killing more than time?
If this is the end

In this shit I lay to waste
In this shit I lay to waste
I lay to waste
I watch the chaos rise
I watch the chaos rise

If this is the end, where do I begin?
Do I leave all that IÊ¼ve ever know behind?
If this is the end, will I be born again?
Or will I self destruct by killing more than time?
If this is the end
