Love, love
The only way I can erase the day
Love, love
The only way I can erase away

["Blade Runner" sample:]
[Deckard:] Do you love me?
[Rachael:] I love you
[Deckard:] Do you trust me?
[Rachael:] I trust you

This song has never ended
Feed upon it
This life is so complicated
Deep inside it
Shut down, donÊ¼t think about it
I pull you in, I canÊ¼t live without it
I just want you to know

Love, love
The only way I can erase the day
Love, love
The only way I can erase away

The sweetest sound that we created
For this I sacrifice
This love is not overrated
For you I lay down my life

This song has never ended
Feed upon it
This life is so complicated
Deep inside it
Shut down, donÊ¼t think about it
I pull you in, I canÊ¼t live without it
I just want you to know

I just want you to know
I just want you to know
I just want you to know
I just want you to know
I just want you to know
I just want you to know

Know, know, know, know, know, know
