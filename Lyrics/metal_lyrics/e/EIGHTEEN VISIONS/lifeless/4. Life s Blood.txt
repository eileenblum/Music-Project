peel this flesh from my face ripping you from my mind.
pull back the layers of skin.
knee deep in piss.
crawling in spit.
i thirst for life.
i've watched this passion slip through my fingers.
prayers of these few parish in the clouds of emotion.
feed my depression with ain and excursion.
drop the hammer on life.
stone this tired soul and caste this body to rot.
taste the life.
greet this pain with open arms.
the blood is life and it shall be mine.
i envy you.
