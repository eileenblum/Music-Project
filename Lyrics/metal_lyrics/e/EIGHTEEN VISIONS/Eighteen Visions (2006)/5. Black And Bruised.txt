My days are numbered down on my life
I know I can't quite make it
You've got your crown so quit your fucking around

[Chorus]
I've broken you
You've broken me now I'm alone

You let the killer kill me tonight
Wounded I'm down on my knees
You hang around like a fucking disease

[Chorus]
I've broken you
You've broken me now I'm alone

Yeah now this world has got me down
It's on my shoulders
Black and bruised I go insane
I go insane

Yeah my mind is gone it's so fucking lost
So please get out of my head
You've leeched on me like a fucking disease

[Chorus]
I've broken you
You've broken me now I'm alone

Yeah now this world has got me down
It's on my shoulders
Black and bruised I go insane
I go insane

Yeah now this world has got me down
It's all but over
Black and bruised I go insane
I go insane
I go insane
I've broken you
You've broken me
