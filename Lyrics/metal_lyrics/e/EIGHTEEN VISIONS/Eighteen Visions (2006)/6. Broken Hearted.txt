I need a beginning again
I want to feel how I used to feel
When everything was in the plam of my hand
And you were here with me

[Chorus]
Ya know I just don't get it
Ya know I really don't get it all
That you would leave so sudden
Well did you know you would leave me all alone?
I think we've fallen apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

Some days I wonder where I would be
Cos I don't think it was wasted time
I always thought you you'd be waiting for me
And now I'm facing the world alone

[Chorus]
Ya know I just don't get it
Ya know I really don't get it all
That you would leave so sudden
Well did you know you would leave me all alone?
I think we've fallen apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted

I wonder what you are doing today
I wonder if you could've ever changed
I wonder if you still think of me, the way it was, the way that it used to be
I need a beginning again
I think we've fallen apart
I don't know where I should start
You left me here to be broken hearted
