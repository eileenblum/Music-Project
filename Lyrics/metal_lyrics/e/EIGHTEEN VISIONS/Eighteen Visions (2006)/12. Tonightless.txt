We can't wait another moment
Our time will come before you know it
With your heart you've got to open up this time

[Chorus]
I don't want to be alone tonight
Am I gonna be tonightless again?
All of the loneliness has got to end
I know the years have been so bittersweet, but you don't have to go so please don't leave

Our souls are lost without each other
We've gotta find time to recover
And if you hold me close this heartache will subside

[Chorus]
I don't want to be alone tonight
Am I gonna be tonightless again?
All of the loneliness has got to end
I know the years have been so bittersweet, but you don't have to go so please don't leave
We'll be tonightless
You know we will
We'll be tonightless again baby
We'll be tonightless
