Rows and rows of white lies keep trying
Is that any way to live?
Don't come to our home thinking I don't care

[Chorus]
Do you think we can't feel it too?
Do you want to see this last or do you even care?
Our sweetest memory is gone
Give it up
Because the end is near
Our sweetest memory is gone

Years and years between the lines gone tainted
Is that any way to live?
I hope it's worth it
Worth all the pain

[Chorus]
Do you think we can't feel it too?
Do you want to see this last or do you even care?
Our sweetest memory is gone
Give it up
Give it up because the end is near
Our sweetest memory is gone

Here we are
Do you want to see this last or do you even care?
Our sweetest memory is gone
Give it up
Give it up because the end is near
Our sweetest memory is gone
