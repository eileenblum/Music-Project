Three days gone by in the desert
I've broken down on the side of the road
The cars drive by and the dust starts rolling
Will I ever find my way back home?
Damn
Beaten down
I can't stand up now
I see it all flash before my eyes
Beaten down can I give up?
Cos it's only three more days till I die

[Chorus]
I'm highway bound for another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound and I don't know where I'm going

I see a face but I can't decide now if it's real or just in my mind
I see a face and he says with a smile
"Welcome to hell cos this is where you'll die."

[Chorus]
I'm highway bound for another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound for now
I can drive
I'm highway bound for another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound and I don't know where I'm going
I don't know where I'm going

Bleed
Let me bleed
Now the love is gone so just bury me
Bleed
Yes I'll bleed
Now the love is gone so just bury me

[Chorus]
I'm highway bound for another pretty suicide
I'm highway bound and I don't know where I'm going

Bleed
Let me bleed until there's no life that's left in me
Bleed
Let me bleed
Now the love is gone so just bury me
Bleed
Yes I'll bleed
Now the love is gone so just bury me
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know but I'm going down
