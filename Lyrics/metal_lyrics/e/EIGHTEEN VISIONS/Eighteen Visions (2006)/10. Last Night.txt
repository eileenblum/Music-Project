I remember all the time you spent with me
It broke my heart to see you go
And I remember those times that you were there for me
And I remember the drive home

[Chorus]
Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night you had to die alone

I remember always looking up to you
But you were never looking down
And I remember that warm September afternoon
And I remember all the sounds

[Chorus]
Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night you had to die alone
Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night I didn't want to say goodbye

You meant the world to me
And I know that we will be together in the end forever baby
Yeah forever baby
I'm feeling alone now
More than I've ever been
I just want to feel you in my arms again

[Chorus]
Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night you had to die alone
Last night
I forgot to tell you
Last night I didn't want to say goodbye
