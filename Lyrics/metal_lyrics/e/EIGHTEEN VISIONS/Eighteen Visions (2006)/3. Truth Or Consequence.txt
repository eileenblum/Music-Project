You've cut it down
Down to the bone
You begin to spite yourself and all that still surrounds
You've been deceived now
By what you've sold

[Chorus]
Truth gave you the consequence and let and left you all alone
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When I was holding you think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
It's killing me so slowly I think...
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight

These streets seem empty
Not a ghost in sight
You walk alone now while you become one with the night
Black cold and heartless
You'll reap what you sew

[Chorus]
Truth gave you the consequence and let and left you all alone
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When I was holding you think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
It's killing me so slowly I think...
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight

This ghost
This town
Has been turned upside down
I don't want to believe
But this ghost is all I see

[Chorus]
Truth gave you the consequence and let and left you all alone
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When I was holding you think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
It's killing me so slowly I think...
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
