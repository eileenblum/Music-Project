You feel the waves as they begin to crash and wash your life away
It strapped you down and made you a slave to the taste
You've messed it up made a mistake and now I think it's time to pay
For all the promises you start to break

[Chorus]
Yeah
In these flames you've burned us alive now
You could've been someone
In these flames you've burned us alive now
Now you've left your impression
I think it's coming back again
And I can't fake the way I feel inside
I don't want you
I don't need you
You've burned me once, but you won't burn me again
Yeah
You mother fucker
You've lost all you loved and all the friends you've made
I picked you up
Gave you another chance to waste
You point your finger at me
But you still won't assume any blame
Think your conspiracy's lead you astray

[Chorus]
Yeah
In these flames you've burned us alive now
You could've been someone
In these flames you've burned us alive now
Now you've left your impression
I think it's coming back again
And I can't fake the way I feel inside
I don't want you
I don't need you
You've burned me once, but you won't burn me again
Yeah

Your misery tears away at your lungs with its sharpest teeth
Your misery has got you down now
You can't come crawling back now running your mouth
I'm sick of all the games
All those years
They seem like yesterday

[Chorus]
Yeah
In these flames you've burned us alive now
You could've been someone
In these flames you've burned us alive now
Now you've left your impression
I think it's coming back again
And I can't fake the way I feel inside
I don't want you
I don't need you
You've burned me once, but you won't burn me again
Yeah
