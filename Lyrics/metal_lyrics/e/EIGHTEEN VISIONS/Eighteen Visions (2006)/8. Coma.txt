On a bed of rusted nails I lay
Just waiting for the sun to fade
I try to escape this, but I'm lost inside
I'm lost forever
I try to escape this, but I've lost my mind so God please save me
I slide away
Into the night
I slide away
Am I dreaming again?

[Chorus]
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now
My head is racing through the night
Comatose don't feel alright

I've got an obsession, but the pain is gone so God please save me
I slide away
Into the night
I slide away
Am I dreaming again?

[Chorus]
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I think it's over now
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now
And now comatose again
I slide away
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And now I think it's over
I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I'm in a coma now
