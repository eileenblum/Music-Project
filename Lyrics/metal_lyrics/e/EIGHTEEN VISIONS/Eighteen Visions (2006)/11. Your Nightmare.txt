You're so meaningless and forgettable
You gotta figure it out figure it out and let it go
You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck to do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say, but don't think that I don't know
We wanna bleed for more
We never wanna get old
We don't wanna get lost in the fashion
Come on
You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck to do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say, but don't think that I don't know

[Chorus]
This is your fantasy
This is your darkest dream
And it's become your nightmare
We'll smash your fantasy
Cos it's not what it seems
And it's become your nightmare

You'll be the one
Dropping to your knees
Begging for us to put you at ease
When the light goes out on the darkness will subside
You'll be running for your life

[Chorus]
This is your fantasy
This is your darkest dream
And it's become your nightmare
We'll smash your fantasy
Cos it's not what it seems
And it's become your nightmare

You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say, but don't think that I don't know
Yeah
You're so damn pathetic
