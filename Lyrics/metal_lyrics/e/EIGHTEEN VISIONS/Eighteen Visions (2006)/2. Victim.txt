You can't be saved
You've gone and dug your grave
And it's getting deeper by the minute
Well you had to turn your back
Ain't cutting you no slack
Hooked on your lies you had me going

[Chorus]
So give me one good reason I should be forgiving you when I don't care anyway
So give me two good reasons I should be forgiving you when I'm the victim today
You through it all away
Still getting high today
You'll crash and burn before you know it
Yeah
Addicted to your lies
Think I've been victimized
Same day, same night, same situation

[Chorus]
So give me one good reason I should be forgiving you when I don't care anyway
So give me two good reasons I should be forgiving you when I'm the victim today

And I feel like I'm the victim
I feel like I have been criticized
Yeah
By every little thing you've said
Now I don't care cos you're the one that's going down
And now I've left you here for dead

[Chorus]
So give me one good reason I should be forgiving you when I don't care anyway
So give me two good reasons I should be forgiving you when I'm the victim today

And I feel like I'm the victim
