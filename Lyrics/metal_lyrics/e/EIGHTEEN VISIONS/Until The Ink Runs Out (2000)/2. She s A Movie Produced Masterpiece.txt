she's a pretty girl.
she's a model in the studio.
she's a beauty queen.
she's a knockout.
she's my beauty queen.
she's a fucking knockout.
blonde bombshell, blue eyed beauty you rock my fucking world.
and she turns me on.
like her names lit up on sunset.
a model in the making and i've fallen for her.
and ill fall for her tonight.
you are my gleaming goddess.
fashion was coincidence.
and shell be my supermodel.
blonde bombshell, blue eyed beauty you rock my fucking world.
can I find myself in the arms of her insanity?
heaven says to beware, I could still end up crazy.
i'll shiver to hold my thoughts,
but the ghosts in my dreams still seem to creep through my head.
and this where my night ends.
slipping across the slides of my dreams.
this is the end.
awaken for the hundredth time.
she's so confusing.
if she only knew she rocked my fucking world in all her glory.
she's a girl.
she's a beauty queen.
she's a fucking knockout.
i'll see her on the silver screen.
her name in lights burning bright.
i'll see her.
she's burning up. yeah.
blonde bombshell, blue eyed beauty you rock my fucking world.
