the piano players dead.
someone shot him in the head.
I want to make sweet love to his fucking music.
who would've wanted the show to end this early?
I guess it's time for the curtain call.
listen to the symphony.
can you hear them play our fucking song?
listen to our fucking love. yeah.
the king said to rock it.
shake rattle n roll.
but who's behind the piano if the piano players dead?
it sure as hell ain't elvis so cut the fucking music.
