sit down and shut up so i can sing you your fucking love song.
yeah so sit down and listen to me.
i've got something to say.
you took that line with too much pride.
so sit down and listen to me i've got something to say.
i'm not gonna let you die.
the money's on the table baby.
the lunatic sits on the glass.
emotionless and white.
just sit back, relax and hold tight.
you're not the big shot anymore.
it gets worse.
you've taken this too far.
i say i should give up on you.
i say i'm giving up on you.
he makes the cut long and wide.
it hurts to breathe.
your suicide.
so where's your lonely cigarette?
cos it's time to come clean.
you won't have the last laugh.
so chalk up that line and hit it hard.
now can you feel the rush?
that rock hits hard.
hits hard as hell.
now i can see why you left.
the taste there was all too good.
and that gloss across your eyes is just shining way too bright.
no one can help you anymore.
could you come back down?
would you come back down?
