Contemplation.
Revelation.
You've tried to bury us with pure hatred.
Cos what you think and what you say is loud
so start eating that shit we're gonna feed you now.
I can't believe that you think you're right
when everything that you say comes from out of spit.
So keep living off that shit you wrote.
Say it again and again and again I'm gunna slit your throat.
You're not the only one alone here.
I see names without faces and the faces hid in fear.
Have you felt humility?
Insanity.
It'll drive you crazy so hey you big critic.
Come and get it.
You won't admit it but you'll spit it out.
And you're the one with the scapegoat.
And it's shameful.
You should be hiding your face now.
You'll take a swim and you'll take a dive
and when you're found facedown will you be alive?
You think that you can be heard in your own little world.
You think that you have the time to be writing those lies.
And you all hide your face so I can't see you smile.
Contemplation.
Revelation.
You've tried to bury us with pure hatred.
Cos what you think and what you say is loud
so start eating that shit we're gonna feed you now.
Have you felt humility?
Insanity.
It'll drive you crazy you'll take a swim and you'll take a dive
and when you're found facedown will you be alive?
Can you? Will you?
Keep it down?
I can see why you're jealous now.
The lights shine on us and your lights shut down.
In a sweat you break.
As we take stage: in your mouth is a 12 gauge.
Why don't you pull the trigger.
Or shut up before your head gets bigger.
I think it's time for you to come clean.
So come clean.
Before your envy bleeds blood green.
Misery is placed and I'm talking to you.
Are you feeling alone?
Your tragedy comes son.
Are you feeling alone?
Because your words at you?
