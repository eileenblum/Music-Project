Can I get away?
Get away from you.
Cos your broken edge is what told the truth.
Standing: in the corner you start facing the wall alone.
Shaking: you crawl away.
But by now you've been so consume.
You gave it up for a dirty dime a dozen now you're layin in the corner so lonely.
Locked up. Locked down.
So down and out.
I'm watchin you die slowly.
Standing: in the corner you start facing the wall alone.
Shaking: you crawl away.
But by now you've been so consumed.
Can I get away?
Get away from you.
Cos your broken edge is what's killing you.
And I choke at the sight of you.
And I choke.
Yeah you're turning blue.
Do you feel fine now?
Can I get away?
Get away from you.
Cos your broken edge is what's killing you.
Do you feel fine now?
And I choke at the sight of you.
And I choke.
Yeah you're turning blue.
