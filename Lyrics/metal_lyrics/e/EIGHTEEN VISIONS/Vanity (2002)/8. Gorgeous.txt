One whisper from your breath is all I hear.
One gaze of deep green eyes is all I see.
We don't need to meet to know.
You're all the same to me I hope.
One touch of fingertips is all I feel.
One kiss from your sweet lips is all I taste.
We don't need to meet to know.
You're all the same to me I hope.
One scorn from all your wrath is all I need.
To know of your typicality.
We don't need to meet to know.
You're all the same to me I hope.
