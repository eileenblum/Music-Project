Let me be the one to breath.
I bathed in mud to wash away the dirt.
Blaming you for all that hurt.
I let you down and soaked up the lies.
But you're the one that opened my eyes.
I let it go and dropped to my knees.
For your forgiveness I'm begging you please.
Cos I broke down and soaked up the lies.
You're still the one that opened my eyes.
Let me be the one to breath.
How did you find me?
When I was layin so low.
I've been hiding.
I've been breeding.
Disgust. Disgrace.
You'll slap that look right off of my face.
I'll play god. I'll play dead.
You'll be the one to shoot me in the head.
And I'm waiting and I'm wanting.
Still hating. Still haunting.
Disbelief and denial.
You're the one that put me on trial.
And I'll try and find out why all these things leave me in doubt.
But this time I'm wrong.
Let it go. Let it out.
And I'll find you. And I'll touch you.
And I'll see you. And I'll trust you.
I've been wanting.
I've been craving.
All these thoughts are real and I'm shaking.
So cover me in this dirt.
Bury me with all that's hurt.
What luck have I found?
My head spins round and round.
I found the feel. I found the flow.
I found what I've been looking for.
I've been wanting.
I've been craving.
All these thoughts are real and I'm shaking.
So cover me in this dirt.
Bury me with all that's hurt.
