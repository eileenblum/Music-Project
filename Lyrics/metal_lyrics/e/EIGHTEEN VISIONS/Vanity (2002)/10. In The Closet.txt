What do you want them all to see?
A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin enemy?
All he wants to do is survive this painful cancer.
You should be looking for the answer now.
And as the silence breaks.
Give him what he can take.
And he finds it hard to be alone.
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take: a way out.
Why don't you set it aside cos he's got nothing to hide you just put him down.
And as the silence breaks give him what he can take: no way out.
He hides behind the door.
You've got it locked and bolted down.
Cant' see behind the door.
Come out. Come out. Come out.
It's time to show the world.
God gave you wings to fly.
So fly the fuck away.
Come out. Come out. Come out.
And Jesus saves.
God gave you wings to fly.
And as the silence breaks.
Give him what he can take:. A way out.
Why don't you set it aside
cos he's got nothing to hid you just put him down Go!
What do you want them all to see?
A blind man with blind faith is he your fuckin enemy?
Come out. Come out. Come out.
