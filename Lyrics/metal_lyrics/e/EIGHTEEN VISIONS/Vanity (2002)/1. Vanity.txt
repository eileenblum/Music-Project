And I wonder?
Where do you get your inspiration?
Where do you find your motivation?
And what motivates me to hold your hand?
And I don't want you to see all these things hid.
When you were holding my hand I didn't think I'd die.
And I wonder?
Why do you make that midnight drive-by?
When you left me out to hang dry?
Well this rope is tightening
and I don't want you to see all these things I hide.
When you were holding my hand I didn't think I'd die.
Yeah. Yeah.
You couldn't tell me that this was the best that you could do.
And now you've left me to hang here all alone.
And she waits for me.
In her Sunday dress laced with pink and white.
You shouldn't have shut me out.
When you're the one that changed your mind.
You could've change your mind.
While I was sitting here alone.
If you should die before you ask me. . . .how am I?
If you should die before you ask me. . . .for my life.
If you should die before you ask me. . . .if I'd die.
If I'd die with you.
She's innocent but she's got a gun yeah.
She'll hand it over and then she'll run yeah.
I'll pull the trigger. Yeah.
I'll pull the trigger. Yeah.
I'll shoot her up. Yeah.
I'll shoot her up bang.
I want you plastic perfection.
I want to see your vanity.
I want you sexy psychotic so I can see your lunacy.
And I wonder?
Where do you get your inspiration?
Where do you find your motivation?
And what motivates me to hold your hand?
Sweetness. . . This isn't working.
I thought the breath that you'd bring would give me life. Yeah.
And she's a mellow dramatic.
She that that I was romantic, but then the gun went off.
And now I've left you to bleed here all alone.
And I look so beautiful.
In her Sunday dress laced with pink and white.
