Red lights gleaming screaming.
You entice this time.
Can't you see I'm teething?
Bleeding from inside.
For you I will not lust.
For you I will not bust.
Which way should I go?
Or should I know.
I can't take it back.
I don't want it back.
For you I will not lust for you I will not bust.
So lay me down.
So I can find my peace now.
So lay me down.
Let me be at ease this time.
So lay me down.
Can't stop the way I feel this time this cancer's eating me inside.
Can't stop the way I feel this time this cancer's eating me alive.
For now I'll weep and wallow.
Cos inside I feel so hollow.
Make me out.
Take me out.
Make me out.
To be the one.
