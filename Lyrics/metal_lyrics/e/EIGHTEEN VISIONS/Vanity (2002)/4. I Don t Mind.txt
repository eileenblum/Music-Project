I don't mind.
If it goes or if it dies.
I don't mind.
If it shows or if it hides.
I don't mind.
If she's low or if she's high.
I don't mind.
If she flows or if she tries.
I don't mind if she rides.
Don't know if she.
I don't mind.
If it goes or if it dies.
I don't mind.
If it shows or if it hids.
I don't mind.
If she's low or if she's high.
I don't mind.
If she flows or if she tries.
I don't know if she rides.
Don't know if she.
Will she show her face?
Will she name her place?
If she shows her face will she show disgrace?
I wanna see her standing alone.
She wanted me to drive so she could go for a ride
I said ~Hop on~ cos it's time to get high.
I can't get away from what I got.
She said she'd be my mind.
She said she'd be the one.
Tempt me. Tease me.
Touch me. Please me.
So come trip into my garden lazy.
So come trip into my garden crazy.
So come trip into my garden.
So you stumbled in.
I don't know where to begin.
Why don't you pull up a seat.
It's time for us to get acquainted.
Start ripping.
Start tearin at me.
Start ripping.
Start tearin.
Blue eyes and I'm starin.
So come trip.
Come stroll.
I think it's time for you to high roll.
I can't get away from what I got.
I don't mind.
