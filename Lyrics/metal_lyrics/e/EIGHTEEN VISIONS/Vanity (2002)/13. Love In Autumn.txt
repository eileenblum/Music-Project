I remember when things just weren't the same.
My life went up in smoke.
The end came crashing down on me.
Just when I found this piece of sympathy.
You turned your back.
Walked away after the eulogy.
Can I touch your lips?
Feel the motion of your kiss?
I remember when I first saw your face.
You took my breath away and left without a trace.
So here I stand empty handed point of view.
I took some time.
The search is up and I found you.
Can I touch your lips.
Feel the motion of your kiss?
Where did you go?
It's not the distance keeping you from seeing me.
It ain't the weather changing minds or changing dreams.
It's not the sight of you when I stepped off the plane.
I think that things will be much better off this way.
And when my seasons change:
I might have to pray for rain.
Now that I've found you, you're not leaving me.
Please stay right by my side.
I'll give you everything.
There she goes.
There she goes with me.
Another lonely winter I don't think we'll see.
Where did you go?
