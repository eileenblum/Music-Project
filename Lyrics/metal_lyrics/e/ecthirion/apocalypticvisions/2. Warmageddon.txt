Dominum amarvimus
Christum expectavimus

Fight, good against evil, fight, it's finished
Forbidden from the light of day
Caught in a world of dark dismay
Lost souls in eternal pain
I'll never see your smile again

It feels like you're falling to the land of death
Where I'll never see your face again
Don't leave me here to fight alone
I need your love to keep me strong
