Day is dawning on this fallen world
The morning star is rising
Eagles are soaring in the sky
And the sun is glistening on the water

The heart of the lion will set you free
A sacrifice for all to see

We ride over mountains
We sail across the seven seas
We fight for your glory

We ride over mountains
We sail across the seven seas
We fight for your glory

Ride over mountains
We sail across the seas
Fight for your glory
We will be free

The heart of the lion will set you free
All you mus do is truly believe

Ride over mountains
We sail across the seven seas
We fight for your glory
