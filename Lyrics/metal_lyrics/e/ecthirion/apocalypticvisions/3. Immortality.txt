Death is chasing after you
Run fast you fool it's catching up
Satan's tearing at your mind
He wants your soul and bones to grind
Life's no game, it's real as hell
You think your mask will hide it well
Don't let yourself fade away
For I will miss you every day...

You cannot destroy my soul
Your filthy lies won't make me cold
My heart will never fade away
You cannot destroy me
I have immortality
You cannot destroy

Can't you see you're slowly fading
In this frozen world you're dying
I can see fear within your eyes
In the night I hear your cfrying

Pain is devouring your soul
Lies will slowly make you cold
Life is ebbing from your bones

Cannot destroy
