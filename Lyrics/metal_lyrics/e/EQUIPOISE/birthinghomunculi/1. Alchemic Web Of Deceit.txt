Oh foolish King of Xerxes, you seek immortality?
The means to your end? Forsaking morality. The price? The lives of those that you rule.
A worthy sacrifice to pay the toll.
You've taken the bait, a lust for power has sealed your fate.
Scribed throughout the sands of these tainted lands,
Alchemic sigils weave my twisted web of deceit. You've been ensnared. Your life now fodder for my flame. Hands reach forth from beyond the gate to collect my offering.

The all seeing eye, it beacons me into a realm mere mortals dare not see.
I'm called onto the void. Once more I've seen the truth, the apex of all space and time.
Finally at long last, I will abandon this flask.
The land falls silent as millions are sacrificed, granting me fathomless power and eternal life. The limits of my abilities are unknown, a living philosophers stone.
