"Homunculous what have you done?"
"Brother of mine... Von Hohenheim... I have escaped..."
"What have you done to me?"
"I've gifted you a body that will last all eternity!"
"At what cost? The lives of my countrymen have been lost! And Now you stand before me draped in what appears to be a suit of my flesh... Answer me Homunculous!"
"I was born of your blood for that I've given you a name, awareness, knowledge, and purpose. A new life! A vessels what I've needed so this elaborate scheme I did arrange... I suppose you could say its equivalent exchange..."

Blood brothers entwined till the end of time. The depths of my schemes will haunt your very dreams. I'll shed this facade and become a god. Blood brothers entwined til the end of time.
"Can you feel them pulsing within? The chorus of your comrades, slaves, and your King, echoing harmoniously in a wave of infinite screams..."

"Homunculous... For this you will breath your last. I will return... For now there is much to learn."
"Go then Hohenheim... You're trapped in this web of mine."
Blood brothers entwined till the end of time. The depths of my schemes will haunt your very dreams. I'll shed this facade and become a god. Blood brothers entwined til the end of time.
