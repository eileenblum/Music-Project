Arcane arts we call into the everblack
On this day we shall bring you back
Our blood for hers
Equivalent exchange

Dematerialized before my eyes and devoured by the void
To save his life I'll sacrifice yet another limb

[Solo: Jimmy Pitts]

Deformed, but not defeated
We will get our bodies back

Cursed are you who have broken the taboo, for your prying eyes have seen the truth
Damned to suffer symbolic deformities, for a fleeting glimpse of eternity

Unforeseen complication, ripped you from my womb to the tomb
Distraught I sought reclamation, an eerie calm before the storm
Ill cries cracked thunderous skies, as I gave birth to gloom
For what lie in the center circle, was no longer the fruit of my womb

[Solo: Hugo Doyon-Karout]

From shadows abound, out of sight, without sound
I find myself hopelessly pinned to the ground
A dastardly qualm, a blade impales each palm as homunculi psalm a grim requiem
Shadows swell in as my nightmare begins
Forced to complete human transmutation
Banished from light for this perilous plight has cast me into a realm of eternal night

Cursed are you who have broken the taboo, for your prying eyes have seen the truth
Damned to suffer symbolic deformities, for a fleeting glimpse of eternity

Cursed are you who have broken the taboo, for your prying eyes have seen the truth
Damned to suffer symbolic deformities, for a fleeting glimpse of eternity
