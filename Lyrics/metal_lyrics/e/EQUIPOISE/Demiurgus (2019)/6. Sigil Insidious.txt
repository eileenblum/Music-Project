[Stevie Boiser:]
Shrouded in sinister secrecy.
Arcane alchemy births pieces of me.
Willing my children into existence,
A force from which there is no resistance.

Birthing homunculi, embodiment of sin.
Casting out these imperfections, my ultimate scheme begins.

Using my seven deadly children and desires of man.
I string and harness the military of this chaotic land.
Pushing its borders beyond boundaries once perceived.
Alchemic atrocities, these puppets have been deceived.

Wrath, pride, gluttony, lust, envy, sloth, and greed.
Our goal is strangulation.
For each task will be assigned, children
We will reap the souls of this nation.

Populating propaganda, a constant state of war.
Blinded solders commit deeds of which they will abhor.
Orchestrating ominous onslaughts the Shadow King unspoiled.
Our territory stained by scarlet soil.

[Guitar Solo 1 by Nick Padovani]

[Guitar Solo 2 by Christian Muenzner]

Beneath the Surface... Sigil Insidious
Transmutation Circle... Unparalleled

Guiding the flow of this nation the Shadow King..
Homunculous!

And artificial children fit to do his bidding.
Terrifying powers gifted by their crimson core.
Indispensable tools of war.

[Guitar Solo 3 by Christian Muenzner]

Wrath, pride, gluttony, lust, envy, sloth, and greed.
Our goal is strangulation.
For each task will be assigned, children
We will reap the souls of this nation.

Seeking sovereign sacrifices who've been beyond the gate.
Human transmutation has forever changed their fates.
Perilous preparations, the promised day is near.
The birth of a new god all the cosmos will revere!

Limits of my abilities are unknown,
And the depths of my schemes will haunt your very dreams.
Perilous preparations, the promised day is near.
The birth of a new god all the cosmos will revere!

Limits of my abilities are unknown,
And the depths of my schemes will haunt your very dreams.
Perilous preparations, the promised day is near.
The birth of a new god all the cosmos will revere!
