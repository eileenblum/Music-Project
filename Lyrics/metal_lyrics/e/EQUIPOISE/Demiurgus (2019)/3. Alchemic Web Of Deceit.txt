[Stevie Boiser]

Oh foolish King of Xerxes, you seek immortality?
The means to your end? Forsaking morality.
The price? The lives of those that you rule.
A worthy sacrifice to pay the toll.

You've taken the bait, a lust for power has sealed your fate.

Scribed throughout the sands, of these tainted lands.
Alchemic sigils, weave my twisted web of deceit.
You've been ensnared, your life now fodder for my flame.
Hands reach forth from beyond the gate, to collect my offering.

[Guitar solo by Sanjay Kumar]

The all seeing eye, it beckons me, into a realm mere mortals dare not see.
I'm called into the void, once more I've seen the truth.
The apex of all space and time.

Finally at long last, I shall abandon this flask.

The land falls silent, as millions are sacrificed.
Granting me fathomless power and eternal life.
The limits of my abilities are unknown.
A living philosopher's stone.

The limits of my abilities are unknown.
A living philosopher's stone.
