Oh, this fate was unforeseen calamity
Dethroned by flesh-born treachery
From a gaping hole in my chest, emissaries outstretch
Pull me back to the void
Back to my genesis

[Solo: Jimmy Pitts]

Shrouded silhouettes reach forth, penumbra tearing me particle from particle
Beckoned by the ageless entity to palaver, the failure of my deeds
Why, God, why would you refuse to become one with me

Back to the void
Back to the truth
Cast into exile

Many names have I: the one, the all, the truth
They call me god, the world, the universe, and atom
For this eve I've summoned thee, you who so desperately wanted the all
The plot you sought, the onslaught
Defeated by humanoid squall

Why was my pursuit of the arcane a taboo
I merely sought to know the all to attain the truth

Dwarf you have not grown beyond your days in the flask
Merely expelled desires and acquired a flesh mask
The power in which you possess was stolen from those you detest
All of that so called knowledge, such arrogance must be repressed

For those who leave me besotted a special hell there is allotted
A fate truly tailored for your sins, symbolic retribution

Oh, you who have failed to see enlightenment
Out done by flesh-born quintessence
Behold your barren portal of truth, bleak with rancor
Once your genesis, now your terminus

Tell me what it was that I was supposed to do
Before I'm bound once more, I'm begging for the truth

Dwarf you have not grown beyond your days in the flask
Merely expelled desires and acquired a flesh mask
The door to your destiny is open wide
Do you dare take a look inside

Listen closely for the words on my breath sentence you to a fate worse than death
You who sought to have it all, condemned to a fate infinitesimal
Banished is your free will, now you shall be a nameless iota that dwells within me
