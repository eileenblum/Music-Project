Welcome to the halls of this, my unhallowed bastion
Sequestered deep beneath the stirring city streets
Sovereign sacrifices seized by my sickening silhouettes
Each bare a burden of sin steeped in hubris

Impetuous alchemists, you who dared to gaze upon the truth
Hopelessly trapped in this web of mine
For our fates are intertwined

For centuries I have waited
Now soon it shall come to pass
Fifty million amestrian lives
Will put untold power in my grasp

Closer now my offerings
For the moon has eclipsed the sun
Through you my desires will finally come into fruition

[Guitar solo]

[Bass solo]

The knowledge that Earth's collected since birth from iota,
To complex organism, is now mine
To complex organism, is now mine

Celestial waves wash over new graves
As I ascend to the heavens

[Guitar solo]

Tendrils reaching through the void
Bridging the realm betwixt gates
Into the eyes of the infinite cosmos

I am he who swallowed god
Omnipotence courses through me
No longer a mere philosopher's stone
Waking divinity

No longer bound by flask, nor suit of flesh
This planet, my throne
The cosmos, my quest

Impetuous alchemists, you dare to defy your deity
Your efforts are futile, your alchemy frugal
But this I'll grant of thee

Brother of mine
Von Hohenheim
I'll grant you the chance to speak your mind
For this eve you die
