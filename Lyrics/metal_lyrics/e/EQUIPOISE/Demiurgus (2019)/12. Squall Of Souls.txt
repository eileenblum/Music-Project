With each year's passing
Centuries seemingly everlasting
I walk amongst man, for they know not what I am
Born of fabled atrocity

Entombed within me are the lives of the lost
Tormented whispers and wails echo a great many tales
I carry with me the burden of your sin
Hundreds of thousands buried just beneath my skin

[Solo: Sanjay Kumar]
[Solo: Jimmy Pitts]

Those who reside inside have aided me in this plot
Centuries of strife
Your sins shall be for naught

Together this army of lost should stand to counteract your atrocities
This is the fall of the Demiurge
The death of a deity

A squall of souls coalesce in sky
Crimson clouds rain back departed lives
