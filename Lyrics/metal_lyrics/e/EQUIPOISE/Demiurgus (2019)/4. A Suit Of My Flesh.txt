[Julien "Nutz" Deyres:]
Homunculous, what have you done?

[Stevie Boiser:]
Brother of mine...
Von Hohenheim!
I have escaped!

[Julien "Nutz" Deyres:]
What have you done to me?

[Stevie Boiser:]
I've gifted you a body that will last all eternity!

[Julien "Nutz" Deyres:]
At what cost? The lives of my countrymen have been lost!
And now you stand before me, draped in what appears to be
A suit of my flesh...
Answer me Homunculous!

[Stevie Boiser:]
I was born of your blood for that I've given you a name, awareness, knowledge, and purpose. A new life!
A vessel's what I've needed, so this elaborate scheme I did arrange...
I suppose you could say it's equivalent exchange...

[Stevie Boiser &amp; Julien "Nutz" Deyres:]
Blood brothers entwined, 'til the end of time.
The depths of my schemes, will haunt your very dreams.
I'll shed this facade, and become a god.
Blood brothers, entwined 'til the end of time.

[Stevie Boiser:]
Can you feel them pulsing within?
The chorus of your comrades, slaves, and your King.
Echoing harmoniously in a wave of infinite screams...

[Julien "Nutz" Deyres:]
Homunculous,
For this you will breathe your last.
I will return,
For now there is much to learn.

[Stevie Boiser:]
Go then Hohenheim...
You're trapped in this web of mine.

[Stevie Boiser &amp; Julien "Nutz" Deyres:]
Blood brothers entwined 'til the end of time. The depths of my schemes will haunt your very dreams. I'll shed this facade and become a god. Blood brothers entwined 'til the end of time.
