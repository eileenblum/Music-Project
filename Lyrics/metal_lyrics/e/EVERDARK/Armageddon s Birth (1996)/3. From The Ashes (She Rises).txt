born from fire
angel of darkness arises
creation of desire
heart of blackness sears

opposes holy father
daughter of satan
temptress of thee
come and take me

such beauty indeed
my evil queen
she shall arise
like a dark phoenix
returns from the ashes
may you grace this night
none can stop your spell
you're beyond death's reach

a vision of glory and seduction
from the ashes she rises to the earth
not even death can claim her soul
beware for she is evil itself

I ride the wings of death
I laugh at god's face
I escape from the grave
to rule over you all
