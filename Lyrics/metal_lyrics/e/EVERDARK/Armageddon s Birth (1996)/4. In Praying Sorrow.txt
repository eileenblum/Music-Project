I remember your words
to go forth and be strong
I forgotten their lies
and the walls between you and them

maybe the sky you'll ride
or the ocean you'll drift
but I know you will
ride the winds this eve
may your spirit upsoar
let us not depart forever
but be enraged to do battle
to avenge your death father

so is "god's will" the fool claimed...
