welcome to our gathering
once you enter you're eternal
come to the tombstone acre
your soul shall be his
we love you but tonite you die
you have been chosen
as the sacrificial victim
in our gravesite rites!

I can taste the blood already
the night is young like virgin flesh
what is pain you shall feel
for only death is truly real
by the order of the black goat
we offer your souls to the horned god
bleed upon the mass desecration

"prepare your flesh for his taking"

dark silhouettes move toward us
shadows amidst the fog
winds of demonic coldness blow
red eyes and a growling voice
tells you not to fear...
for death is the beginning
"yes death is the beginning"

we must confess our morbid desires
the world's sepulture shall be reality
we rejoice the death of christ
we celebrate the fall of the heavens!!!

blasphemous intent, chants of hell
whores of vile sodomic pain
sacrilegious cult, pissing on the church
legion of the unpureest perversities... perversities!

kill all who defy the order
blacken them out of the world
we are one and one is many
deface the words of christ

let your life be free of hypocrisy
rejoice and live under blasphemy
join us and our splendor
laws of death and unholiness
unholiness! on the tombstone altar...
