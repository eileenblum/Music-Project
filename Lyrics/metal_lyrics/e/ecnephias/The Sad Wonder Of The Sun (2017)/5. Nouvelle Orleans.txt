I put my mouth on you
Like a flower on a beach
Now comes the rain and then
The beat gets near to the end

No one cries/dies Nouvelle-OrlÃ©ans
(and the) river flows
'Til the house of the sun.

We get lost suddenly
Under the alcohol
Swing out from the windows now
It opens the night's doors
In every place a smoke
That rises from the coke
And summertime is gone
