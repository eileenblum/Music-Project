Now it's dark, shadows fall on me
I need faith but I've lost my soul
A dark room, the room of my life
Where is our future now and where is your smile?

I need you, you want me
Now the blazes burn my will
A dark room, a grim space
This is the emptiness on things
I've no words in this fog
You know that desolation kills
I cast out in the skies the venom inside

Maldiluna â now we meet again in this time full of tears and pain
Madre luna â your light shine again in this night please hear my cry

Twilight hides our sins
Violence shatters inside dreams
I close my eyes and lay on the ground
Like a great hail on our fields
I've no fear, no desire
You know that constellations guide
I cast out in the skies the venom inside

La luna Ã¨ in cielo e tu risplendi in terra
Nell'oscuro mare tu sei la lanterna
