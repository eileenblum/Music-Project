What is this rite, my father?
It's dance and music, daughter!
This is my answer now
A memory of light
That story, however, is rooted in pain
Millions of slaves, chained by human hate

Let me show you what's inside us
Let me tell you what's behind us
Povo de santo
Let (me) invade you by the magic
Let me free you from the panic
Feel the power of black magic
We're povo de santo

What is good and why?
We suffered hard and died!
This was our tale and now
Our journey has come so far
That story, you know, goes ahead and again
A lump of flesh, of every race and faith
