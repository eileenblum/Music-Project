Only the stars can hold the lonely camp,
Only the desert leagues can understand this
Waterless wastes, a wilderness of wit,
Embattled cold, imagination's cramp.
Now were the desolation fain to stamp
The congealed spirit of man into the pit,
Save that, unquenchable because unlit,
The love of God burns steady, like a lamp.

It burns beyond the sand and stars.
It burns in me, my heart, my arms
The serpent creeps beneath the sea
His mother feeds his energy
O bitter love, you waste my will!
O insane love, you drain my life
Of all those springs of blood that fill
My tired flesh, that's cut by knife

And so the game of fate, veil by veil,
Burns inward, still folding over it
The broken heart of lover, sleeps in me
The angel wings now fly over the Grail

And now your knife slip in front of my eyes
Please take my hand don't tell me lies again
And all your fire rises before my mind
Please take my heart don't make me cry again
