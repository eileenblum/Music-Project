I look at the stars over me
In a thin air and scorching wind
Night falls on earth, the dark comes down
On flocks of dark and motionless birds
There's no cry and there's no noise
Which can break this stunned silence
I sit now at the side of this lake
I'm watching the clear and cool water

The sun is dead by now
It brings the past time that
Comes back and flies away
In a sad summer night

When I touched the sky
It opened another world and then
I kissed the wet and sweet lips
Of young and virgin lives
I dreamed of a world, a world now lost
An oniric strange desire
Every smile and every cut on me
Every knife fostered my spirit
