I've changed at every moment
I always feel like a stranger
I've never seen or found myself
From being so much, I've only soul
A man who has soul has no calm
A man who sees is just what he sees
A man who feels is not who he is

Attentive to what I am and see
I become them and stop being I
Each of my dreams and each desire
Belongs to whoever had it, not me
I am my own landscape
I watch myself

That's why I read, as a stranger,
My being as if it were pages.
Not knowing what will come
And forgetting what has passed,
"Was that me?"
Don't know my life

A weariness of existing
Of being,
A sickness of living beyond
