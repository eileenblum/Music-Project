This night it's raining on the streets, the sky is red and green
And we are far again
This night the memories come back to what we did and said
And now I see the end

You are the true light of these days
You are my flesh and fate
My innocence in chains
You are the sun in the night
The silence of the woods
A caress on my face

I know that your scent is my life
The only smell that I want
And your eyes are my eyes
You know I'm going crazy for you
I don't sleep anymore
We, two black stars in cold
