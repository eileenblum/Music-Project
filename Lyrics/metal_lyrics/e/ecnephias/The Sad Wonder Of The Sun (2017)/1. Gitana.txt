Your hair was full of roses and red snakes
Your eyes were filled with blood and gloomy charm
From the hot sunny land you reach the icy Polar Star
From the filth and the fog you reach the magic land of Spain

Your soul was full of devils and black smiles
Your hands were cold, the skin was shiny and bright
From the cold choppy sea you reach the torrid volcano
From the sand and the dust you reach the ancient land of Cain

Ah! My sweetest Gitana,
Shall I See you in hell? (in hell and pain)
Shall I find you or kiss you one more time
In the summer of the south?
