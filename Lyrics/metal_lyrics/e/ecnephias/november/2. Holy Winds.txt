I search between the vast skies
I can see through the line

Like a cat on snow stalking in the night
I will try to run and take you by my side

Seven winds will rise Holy winds to die

Shadows for two days cover all the towns
In the silent realm hear angel's cry...divine!

Sacred words rip the dark
Ancient gods show their might

Misty lights A new hope?
Now I know There's no sun
The hell...rises!
