Chaos from the past ascends to spark the light
The flame of northern wars relights the evil signs

I am he the king of nocturnal angels and whore
I'll come to extend my lust and my dreams behind you

Take away the wine Pan is never died
Under witched music feel nocturnal pulse in veins
Recall of the wood!
Recall of the wood!

I am now alone crying on my dreams
Raped by satanas nothing belongs to me

Oh , white moon! Bring me high!
Oh fullmoon! Sacrifice!
Again
