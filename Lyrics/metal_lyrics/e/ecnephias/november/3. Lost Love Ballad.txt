Black is my heart white is my face
Looking through the window memories despair
Raise your eyes and watch me the man, the human soul
We have spent our time let me drink the blood...of love

Dark lights twist me like ice
How can live I without her fire
Mother of all abominations
Heaven is so far expect no love

Under pagan trees with a stone in hand
I will kiss your face the serpent in your hair
Now the time has come we can rise again
Too long have these emotions too long for you and me...my dear

Forgive the days forgive the bright days
Deep crimson stains only pain remains
But still we'll live...
