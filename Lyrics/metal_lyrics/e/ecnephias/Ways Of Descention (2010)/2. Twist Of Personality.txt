Iâve come to this place
Full of black hate
Filled with lost souls
That worship my screams
They hope in me
Like in a King
Will I be able to accomplish their will?

Inside my mind
Inside my heart
A war is raging
That crushes walls
Am I in the light
Am I in the dark?
Will I be able to flee destiny?

Iâm in this sea
Full of black oil
Of ships and ghosts
That hear me scream
They bow to me
As to their King
Will I be able to accomplish their will?

A spear through my soul
Pierces through joys
Crossing my chest
Inside my breast
Am I in the light
Am I in the dark?
Will I be able to flee destiny?

I live this hell among two states
The first one brings me to wear a mask
I burn in this street among two fires
The second brings to reveal my beast

VâÃ¨ una doppia essenza in me, Una luna a due facce che piange
Twist of personality that leads to hell, Death of personality that kills the hope
VâÃ¨ una doppia presenza in me, Un sole a due volti che ride
