In the first morning I pray
I invoke my God
I mortify my sins
And I walk over the fog
Over the wall of the unknown

I have paid my price
I am Satan and Christ
I am an infernal saint
And I walk over the fog
Over the wall of the unknown

Deus Inferi
Beyond suspicion I look at you
In umbra domini
My desecration perverts the souls

I see me in the mirror
I look at another me
My eyes shine
And I walk over the fog
Over the wall of the unknown

In my bed I sweat
Nightmares torment me
Black shades dance on me
And I walk over the fog
Over the wall of the unknown

O Mater pietatis et misericordiÃ¦
ego peccator ad te confugio
