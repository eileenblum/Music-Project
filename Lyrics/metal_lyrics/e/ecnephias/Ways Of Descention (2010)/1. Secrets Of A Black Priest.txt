DeÃ¡lba me, DÃ³mine, et munda cor meum

ImpÃ³ne, DÃ³mine, cÃ¡piti meo gÃ¡leam salÃºtis,
ad expugnÃ¡ndos diabÃ³licos incÃºrsus

A dedicate life to serve the Holy Order
Mentoring souls that he led astray
Shaded by faith evoked hidden strengths
Craved he to know what faith cannot grant
Two masters he served with double devotion
The fame he walked with arose no suspect
Then he killed his servant his power he grabbed
Three novices made vanish by demons command!

Silvae Daemonium
Decipit Inprudentem
Requiem Aeternam
Domine Ei dona

A game for the priest to live in disguise
Between daylight masses nightly horned gods banquets
His books arcane letters smelled sulphur and blood
Mysterious events his parish disturbed
Among dawning fogs he roamed far and wide
Black talismans cloths worthy of sacred terror
His dug face those eyes a gloomy charm gave him
But what was believed had come to an end

Silvae Daemonium
Decipit Inprudentem
Preces non dignae
Requiem Ei dona

Terra ed ombre
Occhi che guardan dentro me
Soli come le foglie
Crollano i rimorsi e i pentimenti
Io ora evocherÃ²
