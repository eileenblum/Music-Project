Can't recall ever being alive yet I know I will cry
Can't recall ever being in love yet I know I will hate
I am the godless heaven
I'm the moonless night sky
I'm the endless nothingness

Can't recall ever understanding but I know I will go insane
Can't recall ever being listened but I know I'll cry out loud
I am the godless heaven
I am a mirror without reflection
I am the endless nothingness

My icon moves under twilight trees in the water
I canât see my lost innocence
I will not survive
Maybe I donât exist

And deep inside of me
Nothing but empty veins
A heart that throbs
Just to breathe
I'd want it to stop
Forever
