Your fatherâs turbid deceit
Indelibly stains your wicked conscience
Your love of the idols
Condemned your age to a fierce loneliness
The sins of your liberteen-age
Have made you a syphilitic wench
You cannot deny your essence
And bargain it for any idea of Heaven

So sweet whore just kneel
Kiss your Monsignor
And reckon your lustful whims
As of fate a sinister gift

I beg you Marilene
Give up your prayers
Iâll save you and return you
Back to perdition
I beg you Marilene
Give up your tears
Iâll save you from remorse
Iâll bring you to pleasure

PraecÃ­nge me, DÃ³mine, cingulo puritÃ¡tis,
et extÃ­ngue in lumbis meis humÃ³rem libÃ­dinis;
ut mÃ¡neat in me virtus continÃ©ntiae et castitÃ¡tis.
