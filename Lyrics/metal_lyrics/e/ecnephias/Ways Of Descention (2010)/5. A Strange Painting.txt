Sangue nero dominerÃ 
A strange painting haunts my mind
Sangue morto risorgerÃ 
A thornlike anguish inhabits my chest

Alone on this earth
Sinister shadows and colours
Flirt in a circle of lava
Painting a silent death

A prophecy said
In the old abandoned chapel
On brimstone walls
My whole life was painted
Branded be the fate
Of those who cross the meadows
And sacrifice the Lamb
To the false Master

Sangue nero dominerÃ 
A strange painting haunts my mind
Sangue morto risorgerÃ 
A thornlike anguish inhabits my chest

The old witch she said
On the old wall of a churchyard
Hidden by red veils
My parable was written
Branded be the fate
Of those who cross the meadows
And sacrifice the Lamb
To the false Master

A way through art
A path through death
