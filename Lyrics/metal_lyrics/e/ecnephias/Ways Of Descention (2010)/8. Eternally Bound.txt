Vuole lâanima, vuota e gelida

Iâve travelled for long through ruins and plagues
Iâve lived through the horrors of war
That scattered my hopes my very own soul
Through demons and sorrows untold

Exorcist
Yet your barren face reveals not unease
A morbid pleasure instead I sense that you feel

For Horror pleases
the ones who dare beat
the Ways of Descention!

Exorcist
You shall forever be bound
To the pacts of your ruin
To Darkness â¦

Iâve listened to voices arising from graves
The piercing cold chime of old bells
My moral was lost before I could rot
Amidst fumes and perfumes of hell

Have mercy upon me oh God
After Thy great goodness
Wash me throughly from my wickedness
And cleanse me from my sin
