The stars are covered, the clouds will bring a storm
Darkness in the air, in the roaring wind
I see the souls of the dead escaped from prison cells
Uprooted trees with roots, swept away by rage

The sea is as black as the endless night
Like the sky without peace in a time of suffering
The darkest mother gives disasters and pain
Dancing crazy with joy, terror is her name

The Death is on her arms
She brings fright to your life and destroys a world forever
She is the Mother of the black face
Kali hear the cries
Our flesh burns, a shiver down the spine we feel now

A flash rips the sky from the ashes of hell
Through the gates of fate as a stream of a snake
It will give light on the sand, gold in the dust
A mirage of salvation hidden by a mask

Have you the strength to love the pain?
Can you embrace the death?
Dancing in Destructionâ¦
