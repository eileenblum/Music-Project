[SAKIS:], [MANCAN:]
Voodoo Houngan, Voodoo Mambo
Voodoo MystÃ¨re, Voodoo VÃ©vÃ©

[SAKIS:]
Now you're afraid of the darkest curse, you are no longer safe I'll come for sure
The hour is now late to change the plan, and my evil doll will strike again

[MANCAN:]
Enter the cave and kiss the goat, write with your blood your name on the stone
Beyond the matter is your dream, witchcraft will change your reality

You'll come back, you are mine
slave of the black demon, ruled by the saint ku-bha-sah
mÃ¬rame yo soy Bokor!
And you'll enjoy, daughter of idols ,
daughter of the blood you will lick
Comme un serpent sur mon corps
You have now decided that in your dark fate
There is no peace, join me as you are
Never hate me too, Iâve you in my eyes
I give no life, I will never love

[SAKIS:]
Now you are trapped into this doom, forever sad and without hopes
The light has gone out to draw a trail, but you know the way under your steps

[MANCAN:]
Your soul now bleeds, you feel so strange, you fear that this game will never end
You run through the swamps of misery, because now you kneel in front of my name

Memories from the past come back here dancing around fires
I can see all my thoughts, I whisper to my spirit at the sunrise
