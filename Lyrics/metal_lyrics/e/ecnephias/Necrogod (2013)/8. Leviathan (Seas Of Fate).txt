Every night my soul walks across the seas
To hear the abyss speak, feeling no more pain
Blinded by the lightning I cross my memories
Whispering in the breeze I hear their ghostly speech

The best things in this life are the treasures we canât get
When the sand is red our years have passed away
You could look into my eyes now Iâm a lifeless bone
Dressed like a pirate, hands raised to the sky

Now I sing for you and Iâm hunting you
Itâs an Evil symmetry that leaves you in despair
Now I celebrate the black mass of fate
An Evil liturgy that gives hatred in the air

Every night my mind goes through the rocky cliffs
To listen to the east winds, feeling no more hate
Blinded by the moonlight, I walk through my mazes
Whispering in the breeze I hear the screams of the undead

In the deep of Leviathan we sit in the court of agony
In the abyss of all sins we join in blasphemy
