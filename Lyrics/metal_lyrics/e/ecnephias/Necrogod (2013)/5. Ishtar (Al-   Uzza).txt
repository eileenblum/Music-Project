âAnd now Iâm falling on my way, I look back and down.
The sun of summer now is gone, with its warm breeze I dieâ

Sacrifice is starting, the prophecy unfolds
Lost into your memories, youâre victim of the fate
Rise above the ruins, you want to cry alone
Armageddon warrior, waiting for the end

Oh Motherless Children who walk across the river
For you all I pray Ishtar (Isis), dying for salvation
Oh Motherless Children who crawl across the mud
For you all I pray Al -'Uzza (Inanna), dying for salvation youâll rise

In the claws of time you become thy enemy
Nothing now can scare you, let your fire walk
Day after day you live with your obsessions
Night after night you hold your vocation
