Necrophile
I am the Necrogod
I am the Necromind
Necropain

Hades, oh Hades
I see a world thatâs falling
In Kali Yuga time
I am the God of Terror
Of Chaos and Fantasy
I sacrifice the virgins
On the altars of my rage
I am the doom maker
My name is Hades

Osiris, oh Osiris
I see a peace thatâs ending
In Kali Yuga circle
Iâm the God of the Afterlife
Of the Dead and the UnderworldÂ 
I sacrifice your plans
On the altars of my will
I am the death maker
I am Osiris
