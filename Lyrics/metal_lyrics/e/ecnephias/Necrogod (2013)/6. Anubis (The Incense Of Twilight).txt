Now we are on the border
And the cold is upon us
While everyone is sleeping
In a dream of storm

Open the eyes of your mind
and look to the mountains of lies
admire the blaze of the gold
the incense of twilight has come!
Anubis god Anepu
arise from the necropolis!
Osiris god Asar
command from the afterlife!

Standing on a grey tomb
Weâre waiting for the sign
Look high to the moon
In a dream of fear
