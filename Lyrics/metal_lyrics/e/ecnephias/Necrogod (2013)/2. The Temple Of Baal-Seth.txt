Thereâs a life to win and a night to die
Alone I invoke the gods on earth
I hear a scream of pain, a shout from hell
While a wizard stands on the Temple of Baal

I want to go far away where the wild wind blows
I want to be on my own locked in my soul

Peste Negra , sangue sujo,
caem do cÃ©u sobre os campos do Ã³dio
poderÃ s ver o tormento e a morte
quando a lua fica vermelha e chora

A father kills his bastard son
A mother eats her evil child
I hear a scream of hate, a shout from flames
While a wizard speaks from the Temple of Seth
