Hard is the way to come back
Among the houses and stones of our past
The forest is full of black shadows
They move slowly behind the trees
Nothing and no one will be free
The sun no longer rises

Bullet the sky
Refuse the master
Resist and live
Kukulkan is over us
Shout to the sky
Deny the master
Resist and fight
Kukulkan is killing us

High is the moloch to climb
Among the skulls and bones of our slaves
The village is full of black lava
It moves slowly into the souls
Nothing and no one will be free
The life no longer rises
