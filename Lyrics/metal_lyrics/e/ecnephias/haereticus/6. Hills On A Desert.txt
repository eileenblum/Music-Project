Pray what you can see with beads and idols in your hands
In the hall of celebration obeying unchained laws

Can you feel my presence through the clouds of air 
Silent is the storm a new flash arises
Once you have control so never be the same flesh
Leave behind all you were dead is your world
In the dark and endless deep thereâs a fire - un fuoco
What I see around myself is black - che Ã¨ nero
Iâm a desolated creature - salva me

In your darkest hour enthroned in your silent dwell
Pan will tame your soul anxiety murders Hope

Walk with shadows you cannot be me
Iâm the ruler of this bloodstained throne
Can't you see the rise of the moon
Never cross this land all your torment spreads 

Tra fitte nebbie e boschi umidi
dai miei deserti ombre sâalzano
il nulla si spande e vive dentro te in te
