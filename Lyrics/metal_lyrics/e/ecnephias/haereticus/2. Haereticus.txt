Awful famine the soldiers are dying for bells
During the war the body of muslims devoured
Open the gates the sky is turning red
Boil in the pot the heads of the opposers

Army of Dragon moves! 
From the wings of God

Darkness is complete the stars fall from the sky
Black ecstasy no beast will be so cruel 
Triumphant crusade impaled women on spits
Maâarrat is wrecked christianize this land! 

Mark the Sign of the Cross eating childrenâs flesh 
Slay the scum of the earth crucify them all!

Bafeus  occhi fiammanti
Mater  solve et coagula
Idolus Immondus Mascheri la tua realtÃ 

Awaken to see a desertion war
A twisted lie your faith has left you blind
