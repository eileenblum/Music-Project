Creeping into the dawn the mad wind you welcome
I am seeking for power desire or deviation?
I am the true enemy of your silent embrace
Destroyer of quiet I make bitter your days

A slave state  in you a lifeless discard

Youâre haunted by my cruelty
Horrific rage or sad reality? 
You will feel the spell of lust
Your wings will split and turn to dust
Open to my wishes tasting all my gruesome sin

Bring me home there in the forest
My gloomy world I swear I am honest
Iâm a beast in the wild scent of wicked love
Raping your brain twisting your eyes

No light in your pain another piece of you is gone
I move The shadows

Noia che porta a spegnere le vite che si nutrono di me

Night surrounds you itâs time to drift in the dark
In the eternity of times

Odio che porta a uccidere le vite che si perdono in me
