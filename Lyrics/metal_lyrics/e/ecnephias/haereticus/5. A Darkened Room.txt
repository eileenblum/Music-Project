In that morning shadows fell on me
I need faith now blazes taint my will

Incappucciati fratelli neri
Schiudiam le porte dellâeternitÃ 

A darkened room haunting my soul
Emptiness now hides everything

Canât see the light, prison of silence
Dancing on leaves, searching for answers

Lies and ruins
Abasing my shell
I cast out in the skies
The venom inside me

Fornication with a filthy whore
I have no other mission
How many words been heard?
In my fog disappear
