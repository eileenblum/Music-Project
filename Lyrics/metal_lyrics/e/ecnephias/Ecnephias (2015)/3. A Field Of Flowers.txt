A field of flowers
and my blood now falls
it flows in the years
and I lose everything
and thereâs only death
and it calms this thin air
and everyone sleeps
and dreams in the dark

A field of nothing
an empty memory
Iâm losing myself
and leave everything
a field of white bones
a distant grey sky
a slow oblivion
enlightens me

But the clear and windy night
that touches my memory has passed
sometimes it comes back in the day
in the sultry heat of summer
Among the leaves there in the dark
many curious eyes appeared to me
and my life was made of wind and sky
a life absorbed in the light forever

A field of flowers and nothing moreâ¦
A field of nothing
I canât see the sign
Iâm not afraid and again
I see white walls around those hills
a distant sky and a strange light
