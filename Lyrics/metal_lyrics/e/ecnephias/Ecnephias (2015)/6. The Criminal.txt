Rainy night I hear the screams of the damned
and I'm a sinner a thief of souls
in my dirty hands all things become hot lava
everything around me is consumed
and I push push push

I live a strange life underground
I won't ever see the sun
I live a crazy life with whores
Like a piece of wood I burn

I live in chains
(I am the king)
I canât see the sun
(I am your fear)
I am your drug
(I donât seek love)
Like wood Iâll burn

Empty streets I see the streetlights on me
and I'm a criminal an homeless outlaw
In my dirty thoughts all degrades
even the angels run away
and I push push push

â¦and where are you now?
brother of my past
dark friend of my soul
â¦and where are you going?
terror of my past
dark secret of my hell
