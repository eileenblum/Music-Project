In the night I am here
Iâm the look of your fear
I make the dark and light a fire
I bear your soul so much higher
I sing to heal the wounds
of your cold heart and in your soul
itâs all the best I can show
the darkest cry and the perfect tunes

I feel so alone in this land
(I am a God in this land)
the dense fog binds my legs
(the Lordâs wrath binds my legs)
around me high dunes of red sand
but seems much less
Now itâs the time you know from where I came
Light of your life Firewalker is my name

In the fright I can live
a dirty love I can give
I bring the spark and kill the mind
always one dark step behind
I sing to show the truth
within yourself and in your thoughts
it's really all that counts
the saddest cry the sweetest tune
