Now at the crown of the year
the decadent days of October
I come to thee without fear
Pious chaste and sober

Hear me Lord of the Stars!
Hear me O lily-white goat!
Hear me Mighty Pan!
I come to Thee come to Thee crying

Hear me Lord of the Stars!
for thee Iâve worshipped ever
with stains and sorrows and scars
with joyful endeavour

Here in the dusty air
I build thee a shrine of yew
all green is the garland I wear
but I feed it with blood for dew !

La luna ambrosia risplende
Oscura sinistra e potente
