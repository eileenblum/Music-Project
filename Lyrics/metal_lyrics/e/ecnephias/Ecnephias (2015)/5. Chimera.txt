Death will come and will have your eyes
this death that awaits us
from morning to night
like an old absurd vice
your eyes will be a vain word
a silent cry a silence
so you see them every morning
on when you bow alone

O dear hope
that day we
too will know
that you are
life and nothingness
O dear fate
that day we
too will know
that you are
the master and the end

Death will come and will have your eyes
it's like having a remorse
like to see in the mirror
resurface a dead mask
like listening to closed lips
descend into maelstrom
chained in a long line
dumb and crushed forever
