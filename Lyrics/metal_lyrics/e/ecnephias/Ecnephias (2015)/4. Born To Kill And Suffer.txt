I was born to kill and suffer
To make chaos and pain
I will enter in your useless lives
Iâll bring the wrath of the beast

I was only a child
when I heard that voice
It spoke to me and I was cold
A secret hidden by hate

The trees stood in the dark
and the moon was high on me
An owl showed me the way
The way to meet the shadow

While all the blood flows on the ground
(floor)
my life and your life now meet again
(come together again)
and an ancient melody for children
(to fall asleep)
goes through houses, nightmares,
mountains and streets

Thereâs only one way to know
you have to try
and I was curious and bold
but I was trapped forever

When you fall into the pit
you canât go back
you canât understand my mind
you can only die

La la la la
