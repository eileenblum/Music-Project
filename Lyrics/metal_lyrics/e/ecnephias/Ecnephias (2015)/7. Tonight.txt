Deep in my soul in every silent corner
I feel so cold empty as I am
I can betray my poison kills
proud to be a different thing
I lie to explore from the abyss
can I scream my pain?

I see the starlight madness surrounds myself
I can see this darkness cloudy sky and rainy day
I don't know what it meant to me
a funeral or something deep
here in my house I see no sun
there's no peace for lovers into sin

Face to face you and me tonight
the prophecy of the second sight
now I know the way
and fall again

As night hath stars
more rare than ships in ocean
faint from pole to pole
so all the wonder of her lips
hints her unnavigable soul

Such lights she gives as guide my bark
but I am swallowed in the swell
of her heart's ocean sagely dark
that holds my heaven and holds my hell

In her I live a mote minute
dancing a moment in the sun
in her I die a sterile shoot
of nightshade in oblivion

In her my self dissolves a grain
of salt cast carelessly in the sea
my passion purifies my pain
to peace past personality.
