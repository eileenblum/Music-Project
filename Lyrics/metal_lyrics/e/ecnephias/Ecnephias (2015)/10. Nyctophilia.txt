Notte io la vedo e la sento e la vivo

Night of wind and dust
a memory of a dream
it digs in my time
and opens its black doors
as a sigh of death
as a wicked look
it wraps me in his veil
it frees the blackness in me

Night of rain and thunder
a memory of a place
it digs in my time
and opens its black doors
like a cloak of mist
empty silent space
it wraps me in his frost
and brings dismay on me

If the darkness kills the world
and the fire calls you back
the black abyss drags you with him
with all his wicked devouring greed

Night and I see it and I feel it
and I know it

Nellâaria Ã¨ un vento che va
consuma la mia anima
Ã¨ un suono in terra arida
che brucia la mia vita
