I see nine red snakes around me
an arid desert and black swarms of madness here
surely itâs a nightmare
that obscures my view
and now falls from my hands the antidote

Seven yellow stones stand on me
and golden sand on the edge of nowhere
maybe it's an idea that haunts my old soul
and now falls from my lips my last word

Bright is the moon
so deep the sea
I came before
the wind of doom

I wonât fall from grace
I came before the day and the night
letâs get away from this world this time
