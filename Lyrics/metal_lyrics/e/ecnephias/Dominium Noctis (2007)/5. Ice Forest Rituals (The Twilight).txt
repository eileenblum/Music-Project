I close my eyes and feel, a cold silence on my way
Blackness rising now the time has come, rain is falling on my skin

Deadly Rituals of darksome origin
Here comes the tyrant, the king of ice forest rituals
Now begins the war of pentagram
Ecnephias of hate, women and children in pain

Twilight will hides our sins, a redemption to forgive
Bless me in this velvet dreams, all my sorrows take my brains

Deadly Rituals of darksome origin
Here comes the tyrant, the king of ice forest rituals
Now begins the war of pentagram
Ecnephias of hate, women and children in pain
