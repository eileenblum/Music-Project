Playing with the fire
victim of my lust
in the name of love
suffer my desire

OPEN YOUR EYES, TAKE MY HANDS
KISS ALL MY INNOCENT SINS
YOUR PAIN IS MY PLEAUSURE
YOUR TEARS ARE MY ECSTASY

Look at my own faith
chaos and slaughtering
the only game i admit
is your complicity

Hear my anger
serve you master
you're the virgin
motherfucker

Imprecation
on the murder
you're the victime
of the abuse
