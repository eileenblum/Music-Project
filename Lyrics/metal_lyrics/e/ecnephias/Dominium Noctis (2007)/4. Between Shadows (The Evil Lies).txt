All is grey
as the altar of pain
No remorse
we're the evil ones

From the earth
they call your name
violence
and dark force show their face

RISE â¦â¦.FROM NIGHT.........BETWEEN SHADOWS
LIES........IMMORTAL..............THROUGH THE CANDLES

Natural
the way of pagan faith
Animal
the spirit to survive

Bloody chains
thy world now shall burn
Victory
hipocrisy must ends

RISE.......FROM NIGHT.........BETWEEN SHADOWS
LIES........IMMORTAL..............THROUGH THE CANDLES
RISE.......TO SKY.........BETWEEN SHADOWS
LIES........BEHIND YOU..............THROUGH THE CANDLES
