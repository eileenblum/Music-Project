Eyes to see the endless darkness wind
Future ends where evil takes his race
Raise the fire and dance around his cross
Desert lands obey to your command

Ite maledicti in ignem aeternum

BURN WITCH BURN
ON THE FLAMES OF GOD
FELL THE HORRID FIRE
SLIME YOUR SOUL AND DIE!

Dominate with holy magic ring
Bound by lies to children sacrifice
Morbid priest of nature so divine
Beast arise in your soul in your mind

IUDICIUM ECCLESIAE DAMNAT FLAGITIAM
ROGUS INCENDIT REAM IMPENITEM
IUDICIUM PONTIFICIS DAMNAT FLAGITIAM
REQUIES PERVENIT AD REAM MALEFICAM
