Sunlight fades away, shadows form in clay
Through the darkest realm, desperation claims
Between life and death the throne of nature ends
The ravishing king of hate is coming to show/take his rage/crown

What will remain under the nightfall
alone in flames, look at the mountain

We have arrived to the cross
the spring of eden now falls
deep in the vaults of our blood
to the forgotten we speak

Like a ghost in the air, i wish to be what i'm not
the misery paints our life, now it's the time to die
i've never seen things as now, we resist without control
falling back in the past, black visions of war return

The dark goddess on the tree of life
shares the snake and stands around his fire
Now all is desert, the poison moves in me
Now all is desert, I drive through my dreams
