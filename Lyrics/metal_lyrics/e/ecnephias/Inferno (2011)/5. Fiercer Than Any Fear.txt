I rejoice as black as sin
Today Christâs not with me
My heart craves for every lust
While the nightâs upon us

Oh Dio del Male della Sorte

Away from the sky and its torment
I find solace midst the flames
Iâm immortal as God
Where Light fades I wear the crown

Oh Dio del Male della Sorte

Iâm Fiercer than any fear

Iâll drink the blood of pigs and you men swine
Iâll crush the love of poets and dreamers
Invert my fall and ascent of the faithful
At stake Iâll burn all prophets and seraphim

Here I come and feed my lust
Between naked corpses
Deny that abomination
That you men call Love

Each and every cry of sorrow
Is an ecstasy of pleasure
Thereâs no priest thereâs no prayer
That can save your rotten soul
