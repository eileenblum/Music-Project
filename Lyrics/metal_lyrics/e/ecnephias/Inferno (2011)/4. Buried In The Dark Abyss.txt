O dei, che avete il potere delle cose
ombre silenziose muovete
date a me quanto immerso nella terra
profonda e nel buio

God of faithful murderers
Lord of disbelievers
Hand of greedy thieves
Mentor to ancient whores
God of blood and wine
Gate to filthy sex
Throne that shines on the ashes
Of incestuous cities
God that nails provokers
Inspires black magicians
Compass to errant spectra
Prompter of the priests
God of doubts and monsters
Haven to hearts gone rotten
Muse for deviate verses
Of us renegades

You who bear us in your womb outcasts of the Maker
Children of the night progeny of the wickedness
You who bear us in your womb outcasts of the Maker
Buried in the dark abyss progeny of the  wickedness
