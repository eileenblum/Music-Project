Under my watchful eye
Not a creature can elude me
Your faith tumbles as Iâm near
The idea of sin is an illusion

Death is what you fear the most
But itâs only an awakening
Go(o)d and evil are the same thing
Come and dance free in my circle

Join my light as I'll take you home

Salute o Satana o ribellione
O forza vindice de la ragione
Sorvola i baratri poi si nasconde
Per antri incogniti per vie profonde

If you tremble my smileâs on you
Thereâs no peace that I defend
If you escape me I'm on the back
I demon will conquer you

Life is tiring and trivial
And your priest is but a fool
Light and shadow same old game
In my realm of opposites

Right into the flames I will take you home

Satana luce in tenebra sarÃ  per lâeternitÃ
