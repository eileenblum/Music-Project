A stealthy hand of an occult ghost
Between the folds of the dark of the numbness
It shakes me and I wake up but in my heart
I canât find a gesture nor a face

And I feel as if my life were tied with a thread
To an unknown hand towards the unknown
I feel that I am nothing but the shadow of a face
And I donât exist I exist as the void.

An ancient terror unburied
I bear in my chest as if from a throne
It descends upon me without forgiveness
I am made his servant without insult
