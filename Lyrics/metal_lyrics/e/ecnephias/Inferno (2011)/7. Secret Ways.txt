All sacred codes Gospels and Bibles
have been the cause of the following errors

Separate are those two entities
Soul and Body Body and Soul
Energyâs wicked corporeal
Reasonâs divine spiritual
Godâs hand will punish
the hedonist who knows
no other path no other path

But the following is the one truth

No non câÃ¨ un corpo distinto dallâanima
lâenergia Ã¨ vita lâeterno piacere

Without contraries thereâs no progression
Attraction Repulsion Energy and Reason

Right out of these springs what we call
Good and Evil Evil and Good
Good is the passive it obeys Reason
Evilâs the active Energyâs outcome
Good equals Heaven
Evil is Hell
Excess of sorrow excess of joy
