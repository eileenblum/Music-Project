Well, it's just another day in my life
that's swept away.
And it's just another piece of my heart,
that's torn away again.
But my eyes can not pretend.

[Chorus:]
And I can feel you in my soul
I know sometimes my heart's so cold
I know your here right by my side
The scales have fallen from my eyes

Well, it's just another thorn in my side
That bleeds today
And it's just another spark in my eye
That fades away again
But my mind will not descend
