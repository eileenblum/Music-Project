Lord, you know who I am
And You know me better
Than I know myself
You gave Your love
And now I give you all

You take my shame
You take my pride
You take it all away
You take my shame
You take my pride
I give you all today

Lord, you know I fall short
But you've always loved me
In spite of all my faults
You came for me
Now my heart is Free
