Feeling low, drowning in this pain
Reaping what Iâve sown
And I feel Iâm dying
Should of known not to dive right in
Tried to look away but now I am crying

And I lost myself in a love that kills
And now I canât feel
And now I know, this hell
Itâs time to turn away, from this sin I hate

Feel alone, in this pit Iâve made
Scratch to climb the walls but thereâs no use trying
You didnât know, couldnât look you in the eye, Feeling like a snake when I know Iâm lying

Iâve lost my way from You now, Iâve fallen again. Iâll find my way to You now
Iâm reaching again

After all the Love Youâve shown me
Why do I still put other things before You
Things that can never fill this void inside
Because the only time Iâve ever truly felt whole Lord, Is when Iâm with you
So Iâm.. Iâm reaching for You

Feeling low, Should have known
Not to dive right in
Reaping manâs 1st Sin
