I don't belong here, stranger to this world. This place is not my home, alien. This land of darkness, I do not know. My streets are paved with gold. I am an alien. 

We have traveled on this far, far away from home. With His love to guide our way, we will carry on. 

So unfamiliar to these selfish ways. New life is born in me, alien. I see no more crying, I see no more pain. There is a better place, I am an alien.
