All I am and all that I will ever be, kill my flesh I'll live for all eternity. 

Beyond I fly with eagle's wings. Beyond by hands that eyes have never seen. 

Tear me down, try to stop these words of life in me. I'll rise beyond what you imagine me to be. 

And I'll fly away with You. And I'll fly far beyond. And I'll fly up to the sky. And I'll fly away with You. 

Eyes have not seen all the plans You've made for me. Nor have ears heard all the songs you've born in me. 

I'll fly away, away with You. Far beyond, beyond my dreams. Beyond what I could be, far beyond.
