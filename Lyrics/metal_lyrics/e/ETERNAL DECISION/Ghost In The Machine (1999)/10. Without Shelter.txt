I was a beggar on the street, a lonely soul. I was lost without a home. And I had nothing that this world has to give. Thought I'd always be alone. 

Without shelter, without You. Lost and all alone, trying on my own 

I need You now, and I need You forever. And You first loved me, now I'll love you forever. 

I was the prideful one, it seemed I had it all, but You've shown me I was poor. And I had everything this world has to give, but inside I need more. Now I love You forever.
