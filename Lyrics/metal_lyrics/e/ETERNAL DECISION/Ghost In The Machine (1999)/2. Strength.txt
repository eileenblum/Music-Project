All my life I've lived my way. No matter what was said to me. I fought to be a prideful man. Independence in my head too long. 

When I am weak I am strong. In my weakness I find true strength. When I am weakest, I am strong for You. 

Ostracized I've lived with pain. I've thirst for more than worldly gain. Thorn in my flesh has broken me. My prideful heart's been released for Him. 

Flesh and blood, the old nature dies. Shed my skin of this selfish pride. Cast down but not forsaken. I find my strength in life from You.
