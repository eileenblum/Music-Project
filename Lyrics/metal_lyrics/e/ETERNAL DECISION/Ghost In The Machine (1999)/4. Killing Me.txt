This poison pervades my flesh, the thing I love and hate. I ask for another chance, I pray it's not too late. 

It's killing me, I need Your strength. It's killing me, I need release. It's killing me, please God help me. It's killing me. 

Desire holds and breaks my will, it grips ahold of me. Too weak within myself, strength comes when I believe. 

Die to myself so Christ might live, I know it's the only way. To break this bondage that I'm in, I know it's not too late. I'm killing me.
