Inhale the smoke, take it in. Hold it in till I choke, here I go again. 

Breaking, my addiction is breaking. Hating, my condition I'm hating. Taking, my conviction is taking hold of me. Breaking, never make it if I do it on my own. Breaking, I can't make it if I do it all alone. Breaking, I need you to be there when I'm going down. Breaking, I'm breaking free. 

Shoot it into my vein, feel the flow. Till I block out the pain, fallen down so low. 

First the man takes a drink. then the drink takes a drink. Then the drink takes the man. Now I understand.
