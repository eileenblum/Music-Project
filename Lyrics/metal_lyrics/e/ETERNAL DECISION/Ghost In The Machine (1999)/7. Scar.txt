Help me help you, in your season of desperation. Take my hand my dear friend, I will lead you home where you belong. 

Laying pride aside. I know you've realized just what was lost inside you. I can see it in your eyes, the cost of many lies. I see the scar on your soul. 

This love you gave should have been without condition. You search without for needs within. I will lead you home where you belong. 

So low you fell in the midst of your conviction. You cry for now from broken vows, God will lead you home where you belong.
