Darkness fallen around me, I've known of better times. But now I can't breath, lives taken away from this life. Only You can help me when I am weak. 

Oh Lord, gotta help me make it through all this pain. Oh Lord, gotta help me make it through all this pain inside. 

I need you now to help me with this pain I feel inside. And when my faith is low I need you more to show me where to go in this life. 

Blackened skies all around me. A sullen image is all I see. Time's wasting away all this time, only You can lift me when I'm weak. 

And I feel You come inside. And I feel You like the rain that washes out my heart, heals all my pain. And you take me by the hand, You are my friend. I cannot understand Your love for me. Oh Lord gotta help me make it through all this pain.
