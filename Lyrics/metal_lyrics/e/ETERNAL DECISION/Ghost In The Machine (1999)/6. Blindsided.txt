Should have watched your back, you should have been on guard. You got hit when you least expected, now I see you falling hard. 

You've been blindsided. Hit where you live. You've been blindsided by the things you hid in your heart. 

Sure of yourself, you had no fear inside. You've been fooled by your own deception, your fall came after your pride. 

Didn't count the cost, you stepped across the line. You've been jailed by your own confession, I see you're doing time.
