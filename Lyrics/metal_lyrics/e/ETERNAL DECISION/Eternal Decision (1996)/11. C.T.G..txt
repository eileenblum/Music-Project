Disillusioned, by all you've seen
Men who tell lies and hypocrisy
You take all your pain, you stand alone
Struggle with life, peace never known

Come to God, come to peace
Find real love, find real strength

Things of the past, are leaving you scarred.
You have become, bitter and hard

[Chorus:]
No greater love, a man has known.
To lay down His life for you alone.
For you are my son, dead in your sin.
But you can be made alive again.

[Chorus:]

[Solo: Tommy]
