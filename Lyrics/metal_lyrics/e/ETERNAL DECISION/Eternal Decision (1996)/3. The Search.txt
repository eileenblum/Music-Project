My search for You has come to an end
My hopes and dreams were not what they seemed.
Christ is the truth and the way
(I found out for myself.)
He lifteth me up and carries me away

Seeking for the truth. And you will find.
Find out for myself, no more lies.
Lies were told to me, but truth has set me free
Freed my mind
I have found the way, Know the only way
Seek out Christ.

I try to help you, cause you are my friend.
Your hopes and dreams are not what they seem.
Christ is the truth and the way.
(You'll find out for yourself)
He'll lift you up and carry you away.

[Chorus]
