Hunger, a hunger in my soul.
I hunger for your word.
I hunger , only you can make me whole.
You satisfy my thirst, I hunger.

I have strayed from your will on this path I've chosen.
I had closed up my heart, but now it's open.

Here, here am I.
Come, come live inside.

Hunger pains in my soul, telling me I'm empty.
Well I can see what I need, Your word can complete me.
Cannot move, cannot think, without You with me.
What I need, You freely give. Renew my thinking.
