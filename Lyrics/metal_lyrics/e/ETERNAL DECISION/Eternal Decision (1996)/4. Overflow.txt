The day of atonement has come and gone.
Christ sacrifice sufficient for all.
The only son of my God above is my scapegoat.
His love for us it overflows.

Overflow, God fills me

When I was in a pit, God lift me up.
When I'm least deserving, He shows his love.
Jesus took my place on the cross.
He came looking for me when I was lost.
