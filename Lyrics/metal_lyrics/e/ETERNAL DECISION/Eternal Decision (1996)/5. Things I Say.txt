I am afraid I've let time slip away.
Do you feel betrayed now that you've turned to clay.

Things I didn't say to help you find your way.
I let you go astray, and now you've gone away.

If I had portrayed, would you have fallen prey.
Reaching out to late, gone is yesterday.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Cory]

On my knees I pray, help me learn Lord from my mistakes.
Those I meet try to persuade.
No more living a pale charade.

Things I always say, to help you find your way.
So when you leave this place, Jesus you will embrace.
