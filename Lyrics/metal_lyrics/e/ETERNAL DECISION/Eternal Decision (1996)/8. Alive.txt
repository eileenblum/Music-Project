Resurrection, Eternal life. I live through Jesus Christ.
Because He lives, inside of me I shall never die.

I am alive. To die is gain, to live is Christ.
I am alive. I'm saved by grace let God arise.
Let God arise in me.

Separation from my sin, as far as east from west.
Be magnified in my body, whether by life or death

[Chorus]

[Solo: Tommy]

For God so loved the entire world
that He gave His only Son.
That whosoever believes in Him
Is covered by His blood
