Study the Word of the Lord, learning lessons taught
If God is for me who can be against this child of God

Not by might nor power, but by Gods spirit.
Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ has removed all fears

Look at me can you see, strength and boldness.
I'm Fearless

God has never given me a spirit of fear.
But of live and peace of mind, and words for you to hear.

[Chorus:]

[Solo: Cory]

I will serve the Lord my God, even unto death.
And I will praise His holy name, With My Dying Breath!
