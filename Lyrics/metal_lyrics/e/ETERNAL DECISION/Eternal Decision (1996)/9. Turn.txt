Seeking your face. I'm in need of all your grace.
Patiently I wait, for you to show the way

My open wound, in my pain I turn to You.
Choosing to believe, you return my hope to me

I will turn to You again, help me lay aside my sin.
Take my shame and make me whole again

More of You in my heart, solid from the start
Fill my cup, lift me up from this pit I'm in

[Solo: Cory]

I will Turn

[Solo: Tommy]
