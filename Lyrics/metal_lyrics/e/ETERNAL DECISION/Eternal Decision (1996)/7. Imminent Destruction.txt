Woke up this morning, shot out of bed
When I heard the sirens running through my head. 
Turned on the TV, saw my darkest fear.
Imminent Destruction was finally here.

Spoken by the prophets so long ago.
We should have seen the signs, we should have known.
So blinded by our wealth, we are spiritually poor.
Materials we worship will remain no more.

In the last days, like a thief in the night.
World peace deception, Imminent Destruction.

So much I've never done. I'm to young to die.
But the fear within me as I pray subsides.
Although it's not your wish, some will never see.
I want to thank you God, for your mercy on me.

[Chorus:]

[Solo: 1st Cory, 2nd Tommy]
