I was a zombie, rotting.
Dead flesh, lifeless shell doing evil.
Then God gave me what I needed to find.
To bring my soul to life.

Risen, renewed in mind.
I am Risen. Risen with Christ.

My old sinful nature has died
and my new life is kept with Christ.
I am becoming like the one who raised me up.
He is the son.

Risen, I'm filled with love.
I have my focus on God and things above.
I am risen, renewed in mind.
I am risen, risen with Christ.
God gave me life.

[Solo: 1st Cory, 2nd Tommy]

You, you too can rise
Renew, renew your mind through Christ.
