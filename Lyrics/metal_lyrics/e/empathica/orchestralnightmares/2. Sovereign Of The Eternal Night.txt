Chaos!
â¦
Light from the fire
See the bloody king
Beg for mercy
Kneel to the night lord

Comes from the nightmares
From the dark side
Of eternal night
Sovereign

Sand is his throne
Of spikes is his crown
Now forget all the hopes
You are damned

Fear is his reign
Now youâll know the pain
Here he commands and you
Will obey

Sovereign

Of the night
In aeternum

Stolen of your skin
Cry in pain
Laugh the Night Lord

Comes from the nightmares,
From the dark side
Of eternal night
Sovereign

Sand is his throne
Of spikes is his crown
Now forget all the hopes
You are damned

Fear is his reign
Now youâll know the pain
Here he commands and you
Will obey

Sovereign

Of the night
In aeternum

Hear your soul that begs for the death
Feel the darkness, fill your heart
Keep your belly, bowels fall to ground
See your blood is drained from your veins

Forget sun that shone on your face
Now the pain is all you will have
There's no sky in this land of the deads
Only fear reigns sovereign
