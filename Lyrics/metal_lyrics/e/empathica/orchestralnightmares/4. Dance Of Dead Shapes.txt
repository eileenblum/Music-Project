Dies the sun
over mountains' top
The moon tonight
won't embrace the sky
The crimson shapes
forgot the god's form
Sabbath dance
this macabre dance

Blood
trough the mountains rivers
Flame the night
will paint the darkness
Their lights
their lights...pulse

Dance of dead shapes
Over damned
Moutain's top
Dance of dead shapes

Ad diabolum tripudium aeternoum est

Dance of dead shapes
Over damned
Moutain's top
Dance of dead shapes

The storm
is fading out
When the first light
bathe the clouds
Ashes to ashes
dust to dust

Ad diabolum tripudium aeternoum est
