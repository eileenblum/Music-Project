Open eyes and see the void
Close your mouth and listen death
Tolls of bell that scan your life
Music from the deep

These are the last words breathed
Youâll never forget

This is time to say your last adjurations, this is time to remember darlings and hail them before you see your worst nightmares become reality and swallow you up in a vortex ofâ¦
Delirium

Thereâs no light in this land of fear, dug into an abyss of unspeakable horrors and infernal pains. Now you cannot open your eyes, this is not an horrible dream, this is yourâ¦
Hell

When you cry I start to laugh
My orgasm is your scream
In the void you shout your pain
None can hear your voice

In this grave you cannot die
The death you cannot reach

God
Forgive me

Free
My curse

In this life
There's one sun
You won't be
Eaten by the light

Forget smiles
Forget laughs
Fear and horror
Are your only friends

In this life
There's one sun
You won't be
Eaten by the light

In this life
You cannot die
We compose your
Orchestral Nightmare
