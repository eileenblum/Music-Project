Into the deep sky
I saw the end of the clouds
The cold dark side
Of the infinity
The stream of souls
Shines as bright as stars
Through endless pains
My spirit searches forâ¦

Blades shine in the night
As a fire of stars
Lightning in the dark
Another warrior

Fight for the Life
And fight for the Death
Thereâs no rules
Just fight and kill

Screaming mortals
Kill the mortals and the immortals
Thereâs no moral
For the spirit of the sword

â¦The hall of the gods
Where immortals fight forever
This is the glory
Of warriors and their swords

Blades shine in the night
As a fire of stars
Lightning in the dark
Another warrior

Fight for the Life
And fight for the Death
Thereâs no rules
Just fight and kill

Screaming mortals
Kill the mortals and the immortals
Thereâs no moral
For the spirit of the sword

This is time
To fight
And cry
Now die!
