Unlogical pictures begins to compose together.
But what that Force doesnât know, was that We are Immortal.
We know no downfall, we know no Death.
We are the offsprings of the Agelesses.
Only once, when I was young, I broke the Law. I know no remorses, it was necessary, it was so sadâ¦

Proud nation KÃ¤rgerÃ¤sâ¦
Proud nation KÃ¤rgerÃ¤sâ¦

They defied my Power
they wanted to steal The Black Crystal.
They created their own Gods,
RodÃ¤xx wanted to oppose me.

Rulbrah just wanted to rule
but love she always defied.
Stone, child, TrygÃ¤n Sexton
she spawned Dygon to them.

Itâs not possible to stand against
Order of the Universe.
I was send to intervene,
I created them and so destroyed them.

I broke the Law
but was it my guilt ?
