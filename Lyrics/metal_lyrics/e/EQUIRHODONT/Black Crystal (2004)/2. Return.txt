Father, Father, Father, Father !
Nothing, only empty silenceâ¦

Noisy always have been here,
palace full of Wizards and Mentors,
Fatherâs voice resounds around,
but now sad silence I hear.

Father, Father, Father, Father !
Nothing, only empty silenceâ¦

Where is Raon ? Where is Lykorian ?
Iâm confused, woeful, tired.
And someoneâs voice speaks to me,
dire words, full of despair.

Father, Father, Father, Father !
Nothing, only empty silenceâ¦

Where from these words come ?
And what does this all mean ?
Why everybody disappeared ?
Am I forever alone ?

Father, Father, Father, Father !
Nothing, only empty silenceâ¦
