So what they want to tell me, those unknown voices ?
What Lar wants to tell me?
Why do my dear suffers ?
Who avenged on them ?
I shout with anger and scare.
I will find you and i will return.
I will find you.
I will avenge you.

[Voice:] âI laugh to your wail, Grandiose Magus !

I laugh, however my eyes glow.
Just remember who I am !

Once you find me, you will understand all !
The guilt falls on you.
Just remember who I am !

Remember, my Father !â

I donât know who you are. I donât know your voice,
neither your minds.
But I will find you.
I will find you !
I will find you !
I will find you !

â¦and the eyes of the Daemons are upon you !
