In the wasteland of my arid heart I donât find an explanation.
Ancient, mysterious Symbols of my Ancestors are silent. I donât cry.
Iâm just standing and listening to the whisper of the Spiral.

Vanitas Vanitatum et Vanitas !

I put away my staff and hold The Crystal,
red lightnings across the sky,
fiery circle holds my Soul,
Iâm leaving the place where everything Iâve lost.

Iâm leaving the place where everything, everything Iâve lost.
Iâm leaving the place where everything, everything Iâve lost.

Trapezoid of Fate defined my Way,
where to search, I donât know, He will lead me,
centuries of learning, bones and dust,
Iâll cross the line of Death.

Iâm leaving the place where everything, everything Iâve lost.
Iâm leaving the place where everything, everything Iâve lost

With a single groan I burn the Bridges,
with a single sight I crush the revolt,
with a single move I sweep all from my Way,
Iâll find what I have to find.

Iâm leaving the place where everything, everything Iâve lost.
Iâm leaving the place where everything, everything Iâve lost

I will return with them !
