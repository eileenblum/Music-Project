When I am born somewhere once more.

They say there is nothing!
There, on the other side!
They say there is nobody!
There, on the other side!

But We are living there!
There, on the other side.
Nobody knows that We are there!
There, on the other side.

I created a nation I called KÃ¤rgerÃ¤s. It was my initial work and what was 
its fate you must know, because Dwarves spoke a lot about it. I wasted 
plenty of Time by my fighting against Other Forces, despite Time have never 
played an important role in my Being. But I missed it. You'll never get rid 
of Other Forces anyway. They are here, because We are here as well.
