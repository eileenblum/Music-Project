Ages ago I tried to inspire life to Creatures once more. I have called them 
People! I heard this word from Rodaxx once and I liked it. Oh, what an error 
again. Again there appeared Other Forces on the stage. This time they have 
brought things they have called "gods" to help them. A smart move, really. 
The Others are more and more perfect.

With bewitching whisper
I will conjure up everything
I will recite the mysterious Words,
Gates to the Unknown - wide open.

I know glittering worlds,
And also worlds treaded down by Destruction,
I penetrate into Depths
Which you will never see.

By fiery whirlwind I will cure
The insanity and doom of the world,
With the icy breath I make sleep
Everybody, who have survived.

Flaming bodies, weeping and laugh,
Icy tears, Magic of Masters.
I will curse you forever,
There is no Return from my words.

And so Rodaxx's People turned out to be my big mistake, too. That time, 
after their infamous termination I decided to live only in our Higher Orders 
and dream cobwebs. The Lives with RÃ¡on and Xerida were wonderful.

During my wandering travels I came to the Empire I did not know and which 
had not been created by anybody. It existed by itself, it was the moving 
power of the very essence of Magic and Mystery. In human words, I spent 
there millions of Ages and if I had not been evoked once again, I would have 
stayed there forever. But somebody was calling me, somebody was invoking me 
tenaciously and toughly. So I went.
