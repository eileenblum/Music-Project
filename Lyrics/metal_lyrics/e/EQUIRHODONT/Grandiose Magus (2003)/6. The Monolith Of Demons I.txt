In the abyss of the shining Dark,
The Monolith towers upwards,
So dark and beautiful,
That my eyesight is failing me.

The Force lives in it!
The Force of Demons.

Since the Rise to the End
It has been receiving their gifts,
It knows their Curses and Wishes,
It knows their lusts and Names.

The Force lives in it!
The Force of Demons.

Who will pass the exam,
The Nine Circles of Magic,
Will see its Beauty and Power,
But who will be the chosen one?

The Force lives in it!
The Force of Demons.

My Mother has born me,
My Father have initiated me,
The Old Man has accompanied me
Through the Nine Circles.

The Force lives in it!
The Force of Demons.
