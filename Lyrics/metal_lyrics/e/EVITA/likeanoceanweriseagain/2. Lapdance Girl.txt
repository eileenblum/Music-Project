For far too long I have bared this secret, I cannot bare these lies no more.
I swear to you my love, your kingdom will fall.
Everything you loved will be mine.
Everything you fucking love will be mine.
Your sacred throne will be mine.
You were the crown of disgust.
I won't pray for you today.
I severed the head of your son, like a cattle to the butcher.
Everyone has their price.
Everyone has a price to pay.
Like an ocean we'll rise again. We set sail.
