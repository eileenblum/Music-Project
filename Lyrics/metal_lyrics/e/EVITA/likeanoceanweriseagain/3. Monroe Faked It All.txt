I will not lie again you know what lies ahead, your face is covered in blood and sin your scars show no remorse.
Remember what was left, discovered what was left.
Oh, what we left.
That was what was left.
Like me.
You're taking it all away.
These words they speak, these lines they break.
I pay.
Monroe faked it all.
You can make your own destiny.
As the light becomes what we need, we pay.
Showing no evidence of what was left,
Relief runs through your veins.
You can make your own destiny.
As the light becomes what we need.
We pay this destined.
Monroe faked it all.
You faked it all.
We pay on this destined day.
