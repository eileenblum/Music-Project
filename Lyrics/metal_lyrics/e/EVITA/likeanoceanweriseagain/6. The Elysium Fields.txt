I lay in the dusty sands
Of swords and the bloody hands
My fleshy tomb Cradle's me
This tyrant won't rest.
I lay in the dusty sands
Of swords and broken hands
My fleshy tomb Cradle's me
This tyrant.

This tyrant will never rest
This everlasting nightmare
Will never, end!

I will rest,
Tyrant will rest

And as I fold, my dreams fade away
(I have no dreams. I have no lies)
The darkness becomes my only escape
(Nightmare will end. Nightmare will end)
All that I've seen so far,
All the mistakes I've made,
Darkness claims me

I lay in the dusty sands
With the swords and the broken hands
My fleshy tomb will never Die.

This tyrant will never rest
This Devil's laughs behind me.
Will never, end!

As We Perish!

As we perish, We forget
As We Perish!

And as I fold, my dreams fade away
(I have no dreams. I have no lies)
The darkness becomes my only escape
(Nightmare will end. Nightmare will end)
All that I've seen so far,
All the mistakes I've made,
Darkness claims me.

Tormenting me, 'til there's nothing left
Tormenting me, 'til there's nothing
As We Perish,
We Forget!

Forget!
