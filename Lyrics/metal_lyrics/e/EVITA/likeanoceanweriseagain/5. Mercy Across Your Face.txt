I pressed my face across the window.
It won't get any easier.
I drown in my consideration.
I am changing from within this corpse.
Reality has been taken from me, seems like this happened just gone yesterday.
I wave goodbye to a world I once knew I pressed my face against the glass, I embrace the end.
I promise this won't get any easier.
Now I drown in my consideration.
This is mercy across your face.
I am changing from within this corpse.
Reality has been taken from me, seems like this happened just gone yesterday.
I wave goodbye to a world I once knew.
