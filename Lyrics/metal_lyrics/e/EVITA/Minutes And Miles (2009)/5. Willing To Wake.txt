You can finally call yourself a decent man,
Together we will discover a new tomorrow

Don't try to disguise this is greater than you and me,
Do you need a little time to think for yourself?
Don't try to disguise this is greater than you and me.

And finally call yourself a decent man?
Are you willing to wake up,
And finally call yourself a...

Do you need a little time to think for yourself?
Don't try to disguise this is greater than you and me,
Do you need a little time to think for yourself?
Don't try to disguise this is greater than you and me.

You've got to ask yourself,
Would it really be worth it?

I just need a little time to think for myself.
