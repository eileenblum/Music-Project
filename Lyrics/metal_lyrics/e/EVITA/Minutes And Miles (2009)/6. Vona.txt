All hope is lost.

Shattered in two.
I lay here a broken soul,
Waiting for this to be over.

Will this ever change?
It seems what I held on to has been forgotten.
I will not stand by and watch as innocents bleed.
All hope is lost.

There is still hope left.
Along this empty road.
It is up to us to fight.
For what we're owed.

Even with the pain I still see through.
All the lies that stop the truth.
This kingdom was meant for us all.

There is still hope left.

I'll
Hold
On
To this

Even with the pain I still see through.
All the lies that stop the truth.
This kingdom was meant for us all.
