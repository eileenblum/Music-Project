I am broken
Torn apart by misery
I wait behind locked doors
Hoping they will never find me
I hear your voice through the cracks in the wall

Bitterness now fills me
My eyes are closed to reality
Bitterness now fills me
My eyes are closed to reality

I'm sure I've been here once before
I feel it's me against the world
(Me against the world)
Will this ever cease to be?
This misery

I'll walk you to the edge
Just to see you fall
Tides will come crashing
But we still stand tall

Bitterness now fills me
My eyes are closed to reality

I'm sure I've been here once before
I feel it's me against the world
(Me against the world)
Will this ever cease to be?
This misery

I'm sure I've been here once before
(Been here once before)
I feel it's me against the world
Will this ever cease to be?
This misery

I feel it's me against the world

I'll walk you to the edge
Just to see you fall
