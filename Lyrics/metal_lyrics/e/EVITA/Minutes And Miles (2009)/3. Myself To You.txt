Can you see me?
Can you even see me or have I faded into the background once again?
Do you even see me, 'cause every time I see you it seems the distance grows between us.
Can you feel me?
Or has my presence faded into the corners of my mind.

These false impressions that I seem to convey,
Without intention, they've already judged me.

How can we be so sure in the decisions we make,
When all we see is the world through the thoughts of others?

I have always seen you,
Through the decisions you make and the roads you walk down,
I have always felt you and the presence you have made,
Maybe one day you will realize this,
I no longer see the world through the thoughts of others
These false impressions that I seem to convey,
Without intention, they've already judged me.
They've already judged me.

Why can't they trust me?

How can we be so sure in the decisions we make when all we see is the world through the thoughts of others?

I no longer need to prove myself to you.
