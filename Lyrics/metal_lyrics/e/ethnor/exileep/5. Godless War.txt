The stage is set
The strings are stretched
The pieces are moving

Fragments of past
Reveal themselves
In downfall's debris
Of godless war

Enslaved by the power of fear
In searing chains of Almighty Sun
We lived, we died

We craved the truth of the unknown
We searched for reason to have hope
We followed the signs with passion
But nothing hadn't happened
So we yearned for change

Lifetime has passed, aggression overthrows the fear
Struggle for nothing never ceases
Mankind is on the brink

So strong, yet so fragile
So timid, yet so lustful
So brave, yet so afraid
The path of glory leads you nowhere but the grave

If we are to drown shall You die with us?
If we are to burn shall You die with us?
Divided we stand
Divided we fall

Rulers of Seven Seas Arise!
YOUR LIFE MEANS NOTHING TO US NOW
Hail the genesis of the master race!
YOUR FATE, YOUR FUTURE, YOUR TORTURE, YOUR PAIN
WE COMMAND YOU
OBEY

In the presence of eternal death
You're to breathe as to our demand
Extinct, you are to be
Suppressed slaves

Storms beneath the blackened skies outburst
A taste of power leaves a mess of thoughts
This madness, this hatred, this wrath...
For what?
All is lost

All things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old
(Are) wronging the image that blossoms in deep of my heart

Wheels of warfare are rolling again now
The greatest battle is about to come
The ones who won't die for a thousand years
Are prepared to spill their blood

Time drops in a decay
The sand in hourglass stands still
The moment of no turning back
The years of darkness' reign

It's almost dawn
Yet down is the sun

No feelings left
No pain or remorse
The cities lie in ruins
Fighting to the death
With all their strength for
Dominion delusion

The last blow
To take control
The final solution

THE SIGNAL of OBLITERATION

Night turns to day
Skies melt with fever and rage
Gasping for air, they choke
With stench of burning flesh
Their burning flesh

As the sun sets
In this dying world of ashes and dust
He's alone to pay
The price for extinction and distrust
Ruler of all that remains

This other world I've made
These images I've created
I tried them with a chain to tie
I gave the shape to all
I granted them appearance
Yet with no name
They're destined to fall down

The light we were searching
The light we were waiting for
Is gone
