Is there a place in this cold world,
I am to call home?
Is there a greater wrong to be told,
The things I have done?
The sum of all my fears in the darkness of light
Serene dying eyes

A sleep I'm too tired to awake from
The time is running dry
The sweet music of oblivion
The loudness of the sky
The desert winds call out my name
A chant so pure, so bright
It soothes me with its tranquility
It warms the depths of my corroded heart

Lost is everything I own
Gone is everyone whom I adore
The battle banners are folded
The wind has fallen still
The pain had overcomes me

I cry the heavens, in vain
The earth, the stars, the water
As witness against the questions that remain unanswered
I am a shadow, a void, a long lost and forgotten spirit in a shell of someone who once was there

Image of dying land
Erased and decayed
I saw in fires of war
And yet I hunger to
Build it anew
Emotions deep inside of me
Keep burning and burning...
So burn!

The storm is coming
The winds awaken

The shadows of my past
Aspire from the deep
Grasp me, as I begin
My final journey
To Master of halcyon stars
