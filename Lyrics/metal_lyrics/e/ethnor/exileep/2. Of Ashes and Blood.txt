The spawn of lifeless weak king,
Whose death has brought them from a sleep, plant seething seeds
The War rages on
For all false heirs and hexes to clash for the throne

AN-NU-SHALAMU!
WE PRAISE YOUR NAME!
WITH FIRE AND SWORD, WE STAND TO DELIVER YOUR WORD!

In years to come
Petty despots with their constant feuds will tear the Land apart
We are here to unite and stand for common folk
The sturdy men who address only to The God

The Brotherhood of Steel
Our Master guides us and we follow his will
Purifying flame shall cleanse your body and soul
The passion and the pain as one â torments of past, be gone!

AN-NU-SHALAMU!
WE PRAISE YOUR NAME!

â¦the enemy's nearbyâ¦

ATTACK! CHARGE!

Filthy and witless creatures
Living their miserable impulses
Spread out their rot;
Rangers have found their camp at hand
Then we shall have them slayed

IT IS WOMEN AND CHILDREN!

The One gazes from above, as I rush to see it myself
The scattered remnants of foul mistake we had made
These were not the rebels but the refugees' camp!
The disgraceful act by my own command

And in the dark of the night
We set out torches
We see our fires to rise

And in the dark of the night
We set out torches
We see our fires burn HIGH!

AS IN A DREAM
I SEE MY KIN
NIGHTMARE AWAKE
I SEEâ¦ MY WIFE AND SONâ¦ DEAD

Bereft of life they lie
As my whole world collapse
Their faces are fixed
With silent scream of agony

It's time
We make headway
The pyre for the fallen has faded out
Sleep dear child
No one shall bother you from now on

What was the sound?
I focus to see soldiers on shattered ground
The burst... the bloody mess...
They're trying to stand on with what's left of their legs

I see them crawling back with wailing
I see the madness in their eyes
Their bodies are torn; their spirit is broken
But they keep reaching out their handsâ¦
â¦to the skyâ¦

AN-NU-SHALAMU!
WE PRAISE YOUR NAME!
WITH FIRE AND SWORD
WE STAND (WE STAND!)
AND THEN WE FALL!

I can see hatred in their eyes as they unsheathe their steel
A handful of men blaring loudly, the cause of doom is me
I say:
My kin, my love, my child, now you, my brothers
With all the strength and power in my body I have now
I strike you down!

â¦cursed be your nameâ¦
â¦cursed be your dictateâ¦

A Victory
With one man standing
Lone survivor
To leave the desert

Demons of sand shall welcome me
Underworld wights will clench my hand tight
As far as all the Realm can see
I am to blame and nothing's left behind

In years to come
Bounty hunters with their curved blades will tear my frame apart

Do you feel flattered now, Lord of Crimson Light?
Is that a hint of smile, my Lord of Barren?
Is that your raving howl I hear above the clouded sky, O Lord of Flies?
