As I felt this grace depart
it was a pain I never thought I'd feel
afflicted me with a double loss
as even the track was lost, and lost for real
The heart beats faster in the wake of disaster...
The spiral to her soul, guiding a schizoid to his goal
with pantomime gestures as the god sent decoy
it's a matrix to the heart, lodging happiness to art
leading me to this genuine perception of joy
That penitentiary passivity, imprisoned by negativity
the pandemonium was defeated by the touch of a dove
like a million wild engines roaring through me with vengeance
turning my digital soul into circuits of love
Nothing could measure my love for your treasures
fluent and blooming, I swear this is true
sparkling I followed, no longer feeling hollow
the paraphrase is simple, I fell in love with you
I get so disappointed when in the end it seems
that life is but a sheer revolt to the dream...
Nothing could measure my love for your treasures
fluent and blooming, I swear this is true
sparkling I followed, no longer feeling hollow
the paraphrase is simple, I fell in love with you
