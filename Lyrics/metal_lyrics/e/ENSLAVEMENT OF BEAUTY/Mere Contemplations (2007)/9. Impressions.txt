Reaching heights at the shores, only dreamt of before
while the mountains rise tall in my view
my poisoned heart beats, crystal water's at my feet
as I hope to catch a glimpse of the swans
A sudden calm rise as I watch the blue skies
a soothing chill comes with the breeze
I lay down to rest while the sun sets in west
with an itch in my cold urban soul
I glance upon the hills, carpetbombed by thrills
as the forrest bestows peace upon the void
possessed by dim light, desire sweeps the night
and the climax shines through bluebell mist
As I awake from sleep, desire still sweeps
and the echoes thunders from afar
hours are plundered by the post orgasmic slumber
as the sun seeks shelter in the skies
The sky upholds the rush with a sudden strange blush
passing oceans to reach these shores
the woods sing despair as ruins appear
changing course, sailing into the sun
Exhausted by pleasure I cherish this treasure
I stand naked admiring the view
I behold the purple sky as the summerwinds cry
and the trees turn red beneath the sun
Entangled in sleep as the nightwind weeps
dreaming from dusk 'til dawn
a grey day follows, but far from hollow
I awake to the voice of an angel
If I dream on tomorrow, I will know no sorrow
and if I do I'll just blame it on the rain
leaving the beach in favour of the breach
bounding stronger by every touch
