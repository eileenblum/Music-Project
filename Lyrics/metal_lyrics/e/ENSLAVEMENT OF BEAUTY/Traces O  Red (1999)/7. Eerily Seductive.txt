Eerily... I explore the lacuna in her impurified virginity
Trample these dreams, I still wish for her flesh to be deserted
Gracefully, jetblack and green eyed I suffer the havoc in praise of
profanity
Speak of the devil, even devils get seducted
Fait accompli...
Crown me for being eerie

Eerily seductive... led astray by lesbian allegretto
In impressive overture
Adultery in fucking fugue
The space is pitchblack, bewitched by its blankness
I still wish... lost for words
There is movement in the desert, my poison passes on...

"What does one want when one is engaged in the sexual act?
That everything around you give you its utter attention
Think only of you, care only for you...
Every man wants to be a tyrant when he fornicates"

Eerily... I explore the lacuna in her impurified virginity
Trample these dreams, I still wish for her flesh to be deserted
Gracefully, jetblack and green eyed I suffer the havoc in praise of
profanity
Speak of the devil, even devils get seducted
Fait accompli...
Crown me for being sick, sick, sick!

"It has moreover, been proved that horror
Nastiness, and the frightful are what give pleasure when one fornicates
Beauty is a simple thing, ugliness is the exceptional thing
And firey imaginations, no doubt, always prefer the extraordinary thing to
be simple thing"
