Thou greet my soul with a gesture of oblivion
And bid me to immortalize

Fare thee well, ghastly theatre of mortal flesh
I relinquish all believes

Saddened I pinpoint the world's tragedy:
The itinerant existence eroded by gravity

I sought but did not find
Now I leave the earth in favour of the mind

Dazed and confused, I extinguish the fire
Evoked by tragic memories

Ah, I sail into infinity with thee
Finally able to kiss the stars...

Rapt in galactic beauty, I contemplate and collapse
Reflecting the blasphemous symphonies
