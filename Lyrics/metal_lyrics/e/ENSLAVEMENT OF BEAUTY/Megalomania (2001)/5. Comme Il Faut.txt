[Lyrics: O.A.Myrholt]
[Music: T.E.Tunheim]

The envious audience is chasing us through the cold slop of reality
Exhibited in the dying drama, our design became their wounds
We will never follow their sickening script, never pass them but a fake smile
And every fucking motion is motley, dispelled from morals...

All the little girls have turned into the women that will suck us off...
(Comme il faut...)

Legions of tiara clad virgins are sifting my fairytales,
Morbidly possessing my crayons... and it truly fucking hurts

All I ever wanted was everything and then some
All I ever wanted was to love someone
All I ever wanted was the joy they sell
All I ever wanted was a heaven in my hell

Everything I ever wanted was to disappear here
-all I ever wanted was all they ever wanted...
Everything I ever wanted was an attempt to care
-all I ever wanted was all they ever wanted...

Everything I ever wanted was a pill to make me gleam
Everything I ever wanted was the paramount dream

All I ever wanted was everything... and then some...
All I ever wanted was to love someone...
...The joy they sell...
...A heaven in my hell...
Everything I ever wanted was to disappear...
Everything I ever wanted was an attempt to care...

Everything they ever wanted was a taste of my fluency
Everything they ever wanted was a piece of the tragedy

All I ever wanted, all they ever wanted
All I ever wanted, all they ever wanted...

All I ever wanted was everything and then some
All I ever wanted was to love someone
All I ever wanted was the joy they sell
All I ever wanted was a heaven in my hell

Everything I ever wanted was a pill to make me gleam
Everything I ever wanted was the paramount dream

All I ever wanted, all they ever wanted
I am the drug they always wanted...
