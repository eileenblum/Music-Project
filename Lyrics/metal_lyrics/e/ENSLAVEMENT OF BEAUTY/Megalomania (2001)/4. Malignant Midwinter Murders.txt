[Lyrics: O.A.Myrholt]
[Music: T.E.Tunheim]

The artifice virginal air became the odour of sinful obsession
We subsequently trespassed the boundaries of apt behaviour
A midwinter night's gleam, almost bereaved of sympathy
We drank from all those feeble hearts, we were the masters of deceit

Bohemian soulmates in violent rapture, way beyond the mortal surface
The temptress and Mr Misery, a twosome of unhibited gracedays
We traduced the world with a touch of havoc; fuck everything
She painted the drifting cupid and crowned me; the tranquil king

I recall the glorious days of our malignant midwinter murders
Oh, how benignly malignant we were...
I recall the fragrance of our malignant midwinter murders
Reh rebmemer syawla lliw I...

Bohemian soulmates in violent rapture, way beyond the mortal surface
The temptress and me, a twosome of unhibited gracedays
We traduced the world with a touch of havoc; fuck everything
She painted the drifting cupid and crowned me; the tranquil king
