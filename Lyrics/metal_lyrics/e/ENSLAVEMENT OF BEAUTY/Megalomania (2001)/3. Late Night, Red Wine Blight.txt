[Lyrics: O.A.Myrholt]
[Music: T.E.Tunheim]

Craving hands carved in my back
If love was present I'd make it crack
Cynical tripping from here to there
It'll turn out less painful if I don't care

Sweetest dearie
Mother Mary
Ramble, rumble
The sanguine stumble

Discipline
Disciple queen
Smell the pyre
Death rate dire

I trance in a cynic snakepit eden
The apple of sin seems so easy to sell
I need no love to define this climax
All I need is pure Hollywood hell...

Love is dead and hate ruins the set
Eve goes down on the fair Juliet
Date rape dogma and hell supreme
I am the artist that paints the extreme...

Rapping simmer
Always shimmer
Scent the quibble
Always nibble

Solve the quiz
With a kiss
Kiss the hustle
Solve the puzzle

Taste the mire
Lust, desire
Rape and struggle
Finally snuggle...

I trance in a cynic snakepit eden
The apple of sin seems so easy to sell
I need no love to define this climax
All I need is pure Hollywood hell

Solve the quiz with a kiss
Kiss the hustle, solve the puzzle...
