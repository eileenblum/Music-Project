[Lyrics: O.A.Myrholt]
[Music: T.E.Tunheim]

I whirl like wilted petals in blissful reverie affected only by the recession
Your sinful(glittering) eyes, gentle with concern, windburn my (quasi)famous expression
A thin strip of white appears at the sky and I cherish the soul's retrieval
'cause even when you tempt my soul it's not enough to make you evil

Even though we have never met you seem eerily familiar
As if I have known you forever... oh, blissful dismay
So many similarities...

I bloom like poison, cling to the earth and maintain my imperceptible glare
Sometimes even the devil gets blinded by guilt but I just waive my attempts to care
Voyeuristic and white hot you stare at the expression on my face
My fluency becomes you in a vivacious smile of unearthly grace

Even though we have never met you seem eerily familiar
As if I have known you forever... oh, blissful dismay
So many similarities, bohemians in equal brilliance
Soulmates rejoicing in the fall of a vivid summer day
So many similarities, so many hearts left dead in the breeze
So many equal thoughts of glittering cold
So many patterns black of malicious gold

We could enter eden with hellfire love...
Imagesque addiction transformed into the next intervention
Worship the pleasures of celebrity, exit reality and dream with me...

So many similarities, bohemians in equal brilliance
Soulmates rejoicing in the fall of a vivid summer day
So many similarities, so many hearts left dead in the breeze
So many equal thoughts of glittering cold
So many patterns black of malicious gold
