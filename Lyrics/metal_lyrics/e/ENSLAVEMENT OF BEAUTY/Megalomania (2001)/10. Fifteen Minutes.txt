[Lyrics: O.A.Myrholt]
[Music: T.E.Tunheim]

I am Mephisto in a sanctified guise attired in robes of silk and fur
I was the will o' the wisp of devilish fashion, the glamorous aura of adventure

All the kisses you have ever missed
Wheresoever you may desire to be kissed
We'll kiss and cuddle, we'll fuck and cling
I'll be your decadent plaything

And I only want to be the only one they want...
Oh, their sweetmeat revelation

I'm flying on the wings of my desire
I'm floating on the sea of your lust
Strung out from the burning need to get higher
Beating hearts in an unison of angel dust

I am the hunger of your chaste vulva, beware, your wishes may backfire
I am the traitorous wretch, I inflame satisfaction, celebrity and desire

All the kisses you have ever missed
Wheresoever you may desire to be kissed
We'll kiss and cuddle, we'll fuck and cling
I'll be your decadent plaything

And I only want to be the only one they want...
Oh, their sweetmeat revelation

I'm flying on the wings of my desire
I'm floating on the sea of your lust
Strung out from the burning need to get higher
Beating hearts in an unison of angel dust

15 minutes was all I needed to break free
15 fucking minutes of you and me
15 minutes to leave hell behind
15 fucking minutes to ease my mind

Love is such a great coincidence, lust paces on like a fucking machine
Tearing me in a million directions, thrilling me softly in between
