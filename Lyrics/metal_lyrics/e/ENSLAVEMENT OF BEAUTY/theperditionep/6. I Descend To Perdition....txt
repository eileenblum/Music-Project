[Ole Alexander Myrholt 2008]

We came down from a heavenly high
avoiding the fall with a delinquent late night blight
kissing the darkness while closing our eyes
closing the curtains to extend the rhythm of night

I see the demons gleam
vile opponents beyond redeeming
we all hail the same new dawn
and we'll keep reaping the fruits before they're sown

I remember the rose you held in your hand
as virtue was raped by a vile intent
we shared the late hours of a sweet lone descent
your cunt spread wide to greet the demand
Do you remember the rose I held in my hand?

I used to utilize these tricks to deceive
as I kept pointing to the skies
sneaking it up my sleeve
leaving me with a counterfeit high

I caress you by the waterfall
you lay naked beneath the bright blue sky
and I cede to the light summer breeze
seeking shelter between your thighs

I might not be the one that you were looking for
and I might not be the man you should love
we're tripping now baby...
and I'm coming down fast, hitting an all time low

I'm coming down baby, coming down
I'm coming down baby, down, down
I'm coming down baby, coming down
I'm coming down baby, down, down

I'm coming down, coming down baby
I'm coming down, coming down
I'm coming down, coming down baby
I'm coming down, coming down with you

I analyse the current condition of my demeanour
it's bewildered by the ultimate temptation
I am reliving the pages of this magnificent composition
it's held in weird esteem and I am quite alarmed by all these dreams

I will suppress the detest and ignore the faith
curb the repulsion and the depression and the dread and the hate
I will get back up on the stage because I love you all
I'll keep pouring my heart out cause this is fucking rock n roll...
