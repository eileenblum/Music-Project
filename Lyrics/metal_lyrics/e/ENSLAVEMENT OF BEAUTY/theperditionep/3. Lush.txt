[Ole Alexander Myrholt 2008]

I bestow you my vilest dreams
I awake on the verge of tears

Let's take the lords name in vain
let's take the highroad again

The heaven cracks and all my fears unite
the storm is approaching and Christ, I was right

Let's take the lords name in vain
let's take the highroad again

I felt her hands
fondling my flaws
I saw the eyes of the devil
when I dove into prose

I shrive...
I admit...
I confess...
I am still lost
bewildered by my own thoughts
slicing the muse
reflecting the confusion

I awake on the verge of tears
I will bestow you my vilest dreams

So let's take the lords name in vain
and let's take the highroad again

I feel your hands
fondling my flaws
I see the eyes of the devil
when I dive into prose with you
