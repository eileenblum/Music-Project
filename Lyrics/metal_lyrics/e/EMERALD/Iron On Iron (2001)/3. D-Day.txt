The rain was cold the wind was Sharp, we had to fight to give our part
For freedom we came a march to death
A bullet kills but our soul's wont rest
Were going on to our final breath
Were marching on a hundred miles

Were the force were a fist
You regret that we exist

The fight is hot no time to stop we must go on so make it short
We have to march a hundred miles
Sneaking enemies around surviving that s only what counts
Damn that man who started this war

Were the force were a fist
You regret that we exist

Don't think your nation is indestructible
Cause we come and we will conquer
Don't think your power is inexhaustible
Because you know that we will survive

The rain was cold the wind was sharp we had to fight we gave our part for freedom we came a march to death
Sneaking enemies around surviving that's only what counts
I damn that man who started this war
