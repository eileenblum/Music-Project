You close the door with that feeling inside you,
Something is happening tonight
You bought a ticket that cost you a week pay
You're fool your old man says (fool)

[Chorus]
It's like the beating of the hammer on the anvil
Iron on iron. On iron
It's like the beating of the hammer on the anvil
Iron on iron

Look for the boys the ones they are all right
Look for their dates for tonight
And soon the people are coming in
Than the band begins to play

[Chorus]

Flashing lights and the smoke is coming up
First you hear the guitar scream
You all feel that rhythm of the bass in you
That makes you feeling in a dream

[Chorus]

You closed the door with that feeling inside you
Something is happening tonight
You bought a ticket that cost you a week pay
You're a fool your old man says

[Chorus]
