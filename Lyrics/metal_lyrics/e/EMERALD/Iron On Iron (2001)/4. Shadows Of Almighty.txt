There was a time going out off my head
That I couldn't think I was going mad
People laughed but I could have cry
No one could see my mind was dying

There was a time that I walked in the streets
But no place to go ,no one to meet
I played the clown but I was a fool
For being alright men made some rules

God what makes you afraid Oh shadows or might
what makes you afraid oh shadows or might shadows or might

I learned this rules for being all right
I tried to be them and thought I did nice
But it ain't me to walk the lines
Signs on the wall tells me I ain't alone

God what makes you afraid Oh shadows or might
what makes you afraid oh shadows or might shadows or might

There comes a time going out off my head
That I just cant think I'm going mad
People will laugh but I can cry
No one can see my mind is dying

God what makes me afraid Oh shadows or might
what makes you afraid oh shadows or might shadows or might
