You're gone for good,you're choice to step out your life
The mess you lived in made you cruel you know  it made you so wild.

Now you're gone for good the funeral is tomorrow

Suicide what's the use of life, in hell you died.
No one would see no one who heard your cry.
You know you payed so hard for getting free.
I know you tried so good but no one understood
I know you cared for all.

You're gone for good, you're choice to step out your life
the mess you lived in, it made you so cruel it made you so wild.

Oh lord, take my friend

Suicide what's the use of life ,in hell you died.
No one would see no one who heard your cry
And I know you you prayed so much for getting free
I know you tried so good no one understood
Oh no you cant be forgotten
