All right you decided that night for a jump in the dark.
You packed your things in small bags and hiked from the north to the south.
This place was to dull and too small Johnny is on the run.

You didn't know what was coming; you didn't know what you threw away.
Leaving home forever but you didn't know where to stay.
This place was to dull and too small Johnny you're on the run.

Now you are independent, and no one tells you what to do.
Following the sun and sometimes you follow the moon.
This place was to dull and to small Johnny you re on the run

Tell me what you want, the world ain't a place just for fun
The boring be there all the time, always alone.
Hear me what I say you moving still further away
Each day will be a day without fun you are on the run, run.

You are living in silence, but silence is not what you wanted.
Look to the horizon, to north cause that's where you belong.
This world was so big and so wrong, Johnny you re on the run
This place was to dull and to small .run john run.
