Dark clouds are hanging over the shore
Thundering and lightning
Heaven in rage
Evil is lurking
The good has to fall
One lonely rider standing 'gainst all
Hero draw your blade
It's long-foretold fate
Ride towards your enemy
Fight evil eternally
Feared by his enemies
And deadly to them
Hailed by his people
A hero he is
Fighting with honour
Fighting with pride
His soul is immortal
He dies at his fight
Hero draw your blade
Valhalla is your fate
Odin by thy side
Forever you will fight
Some bards are singing
Storytellers telling
A Hero he was
A Legend he is
Hero draw your blade
It's long-foretold fate
Ride towards your enemy
Fight evil eternally
Hero draw your blade
Valhalla is your fate
Odin by thy side
Forever you will fight
