When the times are dark
And the evil's strong
When it seems that all is lost
Give up your honour
Give up your pride
But never give up your hope
Then... There are marching men
Brave and firm
Fighting for the land
As long as they stand together
Always will be hope
Friendship and loyality
Brothers for the land
As long as we stand together
Always will be hope
There are loving hearts
Faithful and willing
To make sacrifices
As long as they love each other
Always will be hope
Friendship and loyality
Brothers for the land
As long as we stand together
Always will be hope
Even when the light has gone
There are brothers bound to you
Give up your fear and lethargy
Take courage from the hope
And... Take your sword and ride with me
We'll seek justice for the land
As long as we hold together
Always will be hope
Friendship and loyality
Brothers for the land
As long as we stand together
Always will be hope
