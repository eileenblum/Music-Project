Last day on earth
The sun has gone
Darkness and evil rising from the dawn
I'm alone, I'm on my own
I feel the evil in the night
Looking at me, trying to rob my soul
Eyes are glancing at me
Trying to rob my soul
I'm afraid of the night
There's something in the dark
The ground is shakin'
Heaven's on fire
The walls are bleeding the end is near
Evil grows, monsters around us
The wolf is coming bringing the end
The gods are dead and mankind will go down
Eyes are glancing at me
Trying to rob my soul
I'm afraid of the night
There's something in the dark
I will fight
I will win
Kill the master by the power of light
They're strong, light is fading
Only shadows left behind
Am I lost or will I die?
Eyes are glancing at me
Trying to rob my soul
I'm afraid of the night
There's something in the dark
