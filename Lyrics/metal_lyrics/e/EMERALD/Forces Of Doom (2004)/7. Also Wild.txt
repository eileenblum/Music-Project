In the first centuries
There were cavemen
They were real barbarians
Didn't fear anything
Then the great vikings came
They crossed the seven seas
To take it up with everyone
In search of new loot
Today's our turn
No, we don't wanna fight
But nevertheless
We're also wild
Don't forget the knights
Strong men marched to die
To defend their kingdom
To let their lives
Nowadays they talk a lot
About skinheads
That they destroy everything
They don't accept
Today's our turn
No, we don't wanna fight
But nevertheless
We're also wild
In the near future
I can see non-human cyborgs
They'll gonna fight at wars
Our wars
But you know that...
Today's our turn
No, we don't wanna fight
But nevertheless
We're also wild
