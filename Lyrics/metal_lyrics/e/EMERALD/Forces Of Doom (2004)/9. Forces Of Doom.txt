Evil Priests are hiding
Behind the shadow wall
Expecting us to fail
But no one breaks our will
You cannot conquer greatness
Immortality at last
Your brotherhood is black
Unwanted spells are cast
We are united in the end
Steel Vultures on our side
Carrying our bloodline
Until the evil has gone
You are Forces of doom
Your magic cannot help
Resistant we all stand
Against the whole infected world
Many lifes have past
And Darkness has survived
Destroyed their fractured souls
But our hearts still are the same
Revolution is our aim
Metal Conjuring our land
Now we smash your darkened lies
Until all evil dies
You are Forces of doom
Your magic cannot help
Resistant we all stand
Against the whole infected world
You are Forces of doom
Your magic cannot help
Resistant we all stand
Against the whole infected world
