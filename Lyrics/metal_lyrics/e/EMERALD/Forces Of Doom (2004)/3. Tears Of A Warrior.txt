Standing above you with his sword of steel
Looks in your eyes, the blade in the sun
And you know what you're going to feel
The pain of the sacrificed one
Tears of a warrior
When life is lost, the final cost
Tears of a warrior
The only time to cry, is when you die
I know I'm not afraid of dying
The time is here and now I am crying
To my gods I pray "please have mercy"
Or I'll be with them at their courtesy
Tears of a warrior
When life is lost, the final cost
Tears of a warrior
The only time to cry, is when you die
Tears of a warrior
When life is lost, the final cost
Tears of a warrior
The only time to cry, is when you die
