Do you think we are evil?
Premature figure of disease
You don't look proud enough to us
Do you think we are guilty?
Just because we don't look like you
There is one way and it's down for your
Bright stars, breaking apart
As you're blinded by the noise
True soldiers, stick together
As we're marching for the blood
For the blood of our kings
Now your're still believing
In the trash without value
And wasting your precious lifetime
Do you think we're evil?
We're just pawns in this game
At least not like you - lame
Bright stars, breaking apart
As you're blinded by the noise
True soldiers, stick together
As we're marching for the blood
For the blood of our kings
Bright stars, breaking apart
As you're blinded by the noise
True soldiers, stick together
As we're marching for the blood
For the blood of our kings
