Lies of oppressing masses
How long will I stand
Can I live on
In this factory-made land
I'm hearing the call, freedom belongs
It's time to unite
March forward brave one
Crushing the emperors - the emperors rite
Fight for honour
A soldier of fortune is sharing his pain
Fight for power
Another day passed
And we still grow stronger
Until freedom returns
Future's lights have passed by
Blood on my face
Sweat and thousand tears
Still inside my hiding years
Fight for honour
A soldier of fortune is sharing his pain
Fight for power
Another day passed
And we still grow stronger
Until freedom returns
Fight for honour
A soldier of fortune is sharing his pain
Fight for power
Another day passed
And we still grow stronger
Until freedom returns
