You came into my life
Like a bolt from the blue
I'll never forget the day
When we met the first time
A fire flamed up in my heart
Forever will I love you
Forever will I stay at your side
Forever will I honour you
Forever... You're all I need to live
When I look into your eyes
I know that you're the one
You are my destiny
And you mean everything to me
Everytime we're not together
I'm longing for you
My thoughts are always with you
You made all my dreams come true
Forever will I love you
Forever will I stay at your side
Forever will I honour you
Forever... You're all I need to live
Together we reach out for the stars
Noone will ever separate us
I know that our love will last forever
Cause we belong together
Forever will I love you
Forever will I stay at your side
Forever will I honour you
Forever... You're all I need to live
