You
You look at me
I don't look like you
And I donât act like you

My hair is long
Blood and monsters on my shirt
And the war I talk
makes you feel like something better

But you must know
But you must know that I...

I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna live like you
I don't care about your rules
I'm going my wayâ¦my way!!

You
You think that you represent
The standard for us all
That we should accommodate to you

But I don't give a fuck
About your expectations
My will is stronger than steel
You will never break me

And you must know
And you must know that Iâ¦

I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna live like you
I don't care about your rules I'm going my way... my way!!
