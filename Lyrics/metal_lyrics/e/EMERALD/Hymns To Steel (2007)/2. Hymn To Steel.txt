Turn up the volume to ten
A guitar starts to scream
Pounding drums, pumping bass
And a scream in the night

Hot girls in leather, ready for action
Banging metal maniacs raising their fists
Chains and leather, skulls and beasts
This is what heavy metal needs

So metatheads unite
And sing with us this ode to steel

This is our Hymn to Steel
Hail!
The spirit of metal will never die
This is our Hymn to Steel
Hail!
United we'll keep the flame burning

It is our life and it's in our blood
We don't give a fuck about today's trends
We don't want to be like the others
Poor normal creatures and their boring life

So metalheads unite
And sing with us this ode to steel

This is our Hymn to Steel
Hail!
The spirit of metal will never die
This is our Hymn to Steel
Hail!
United we'll keep the flame burning

Metal - Brings glory to us all
Metal - We dedicate our life to steel
Metal - If you're not born as a metalhead
you will never understand!!

So metalheads unite
And sing with us this ode to steel

This is our Hymn to Steel
Hail!
The spirit of metal will never die
This is our Hymn to Steel
Hail!
United weâll keep the flame burning
