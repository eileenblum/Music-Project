The day when we met
I'll never forget
Silent snow was falling
My broken heart was calling

You were the colour in my life
You gave me warmth, love and hope
Now that you're gone
My life turned back to black

Will you ever return again?
From these wars, battles and pain
Watching you riding away
Waiting for messages day by day
Tears falling down, seasons change
Still I've heard nothing to calm down my fears

The war has come so quick
Marching orders had arrived
Soon you were gone
Leaving us behind

I look into our children's faces
To see you live in them
To look upon a living picture
Of my love again

Will you ever return again?
From these wars, battles and pain
Watching you riding away
Waiting for messages day by day
Tears falling down, seasons change
Still I've heard nothing to calm down my fears

Will you ever return again?
From these wars, battles and pain
Watching you riding away
Waiting for messages day by day
Tears falling down, seasons change
Still I've heard nothing to calm down my fears

Will our children see you again?
'Till then nothing will cease down my pain
Hearing your staggered goodbye
Praying that you wonât die
Tears falling down, seasons change
Still Iâve heard nothing to calm down my fears
