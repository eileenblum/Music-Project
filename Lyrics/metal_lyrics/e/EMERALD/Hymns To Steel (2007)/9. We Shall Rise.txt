We shall rise... to the heavens, in the epoch of steel
Hide... from the evil, tempting with might
Fightâ¦ against the forces, holding us back
Feelâ¦ the powers awakened in us

We shall riseâ¦ by the strength within our own
Command... the forms of inner control
Rule... with mercy for all the believers
Consent of Conflict... laid on our souls

It's the end of a century
The new era has begun
Itâs too late if you haven not seen by now
We ride into the setting sun

We shall riseâ¦ among the warlords, devoted to battle
Defendâ¦ our legacy, the right to be free
March onâ¦ until no one left to pretend
In gloryâ¦ to light, we shall transcend

We shall riseâ¦ unbroken, victorious at last
Burning... the bridges, behold our past
Ignoring... the pain and all of the tosses
Final Solutions... have always been fatal

It's the end of a century
The new era has begun
It's too late if you have not seen by now
We ride into the setting sun

Oh, great one, hear our call
We've come from distance, we come from afar
The message was always here in our hearts
Protect our soul and spirit
As we fulfil the prophecy
The message was always here in our hearts
Burning desires to reach to the stars

We shall
We shall
We shallâ¦ rise!
