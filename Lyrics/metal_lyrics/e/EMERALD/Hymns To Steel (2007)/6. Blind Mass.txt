Reincarnated souls without memory
Running around in search for sense
Everything has been prepared for you
Just listen and follow the blind

They teach, they preach and youâre just nodding
They cloak our history and cipher the truth
Bread and circuses to distract your attention
Religions to slave our mind, to reign mankind

You're a victim of your past
You're a victim of your blind mind
You're a victim of the illusion
You're a victim of the...
Manipulation!

Science is caught in dogmas
Media is filtered through political might
The truth sold for money, the spirit killed
No one to ask questions anymore

You're a victim of your past
Youâre a victim of your blind mind
You're a victim of the illusion
You're a victim of the...
Manipulation!

So open your eyes
Open your heart
Can't you see what's going on around you
Don't be a part of the Blind mass!

Do you believe?
Do you believe the lies?
Do you believe?
Believe the lies?
Do you still believe?
Believe the lies?
Do you believe? The lies!

So open your eyes
Open your heart
Can't you see what's going on around you
Don't be a part of the Blind mass!
