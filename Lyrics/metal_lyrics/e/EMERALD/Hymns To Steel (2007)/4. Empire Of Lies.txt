Take a look around and breathe deep the dark
Stop for an instant, observe your busy life
Something is wrong on this planet
But for millions life just goes on

Time is running, faster and faster
Efficient production, only importance
Best benefit, all that counts
Were daywalkers, the matrix works

War - A TV sensation for masses
War - A human tradition since thousands of years
War - Their way to decimate us
War - Their billion dollar business

The new order is near
The agenda can't be stopped

Manipulated masses
We're living in a...
Empire of Lies
Shut up and go back to work!
We're living in a...
Empire of Lies

Blinded by luxury
And stupid TV shows
Our spoiled consumer society
Forgot what life was all about

Politicians and presidents
Are just puppets on a string
For money and fame they sold their soul
Never know who laughs behind the mask

War - The new TV sensation for masses
War - A human tradition since thousands of years
War - Their way to grow stronger
War â Their billion dollar business

The new order is here
An unstoppable force in control

Manipulated masses
We're living in a...
Empire of Lies
Shut up and go back to work!
We're living in a...
Empire of Lies
