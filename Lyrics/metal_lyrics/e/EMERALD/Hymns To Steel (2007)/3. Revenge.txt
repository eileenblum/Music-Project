Brothers, we were, blood that bounds
Until the death of our father
The king is dead, long live the king
But which one is stronger

Twins are evil, not divine
Locked me into the dungeon
So many years I stopped counting
But I won't wait, no longer
No longer

Because I, I swear Revenge
Someday I'll overthrow your reign
And be my own king
And I, I swear Revenge
In the castle of tyranny
Taste sweet Revenge

The seconds pass faster than light
Escaping the prison, running for my life
Inside my mind, it hurts so deep
But I will return

Because I, I swear Revenge
Someday Iâll overthrow your reign
And be my own king
And I, I swear Revenge
In the castle of tyranny
Taste sweet Revenge
