Once upon a time
When heroes walked the earth
Bards were singing aloud
Of deeds so proud and fine

A young singer rose
To the bard that the king chose
Engaged for telling lies
The sinister he denies

Bard of the king
He's cursed to sing
Lies about tales
'cause the king never fails
No freedom, no choice
About his own voice

The king as dragonstayer
With force, a demonkiller
A saviour of maidens
Invented deeds to deceive history

He let his soldiers fight
For himself and his right
The bard was singing loud
Of the king as warrior proud

Bard of the king
He's cursed to sing
Lies about tales
'cause the king never fails
No freedom, no choice
About his own voice

No freedom to win
As bard of the king
He quit his cursed job
To sing now for the mob

Soon he was found dead
A bloody mess in his bed
No one betrays the king
No freedom to win

Bard of the king
He's cursed to sing
Lies about tales
'cause the king never fails
No freedom, no choice
About his own voice
