He thinks he's sweet and kind
He's in everybody's mind
Spends all his money
for drugs, it ain't funny
He thinks he's the king
of the world

He tries to influence little children
He makes them gifts
Theyâre happy with
Yeah, they think
That he is their hero
But they are wrong

He treats others like slaves
And let them do his work
He tyrannizes everyone
Who doesnât listen to what he says

So Lord if you want me to pray
Then listen what I've got to tell
Show no mercy and
Send this Bastard to hell

Everyday when the school's out
He's waiting behind the wall, oh yeah
He catches the first guy
And tells him to try

He treats others like slaves
And let them do his work
He tyrannizes everyone
Who doesnât listen to what he says

So Lord if you want me to pray
Then listen what I've got to tell
Show no mercy and
Send this Bastard to hell
