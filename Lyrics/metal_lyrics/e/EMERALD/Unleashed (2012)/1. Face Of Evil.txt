He is a neighbour, a nice guy it seems 
No one knows of his sick fantasies
Mothers and fathers would cry as they'd see 
All his pictures stored on PC

The devil hides his face 
Living in disgrace
He works in subtle ways

She is a housewife, a good spouse they say 
Her husband loves her, a perfect family
He is a man that works every day
While his wife commits adultery

Face of Evil 
Veiled by a mask
Face of Evil
You'll be revealed one day

The devil hides his face 
Living in disgrace
He works in subtle ways

They wear a dark suit, a tie to match the shirt 
Business is flawless, fine feathers make fine birds
Endless avarice, no time for sympathy
For those who will die because of poverty

Face of Evil 
Veiled by a mask
Face of Evil
You'll be revealed one day

Idolatry, witchcraft, murders, heresy ... 
They which do such things shall not inherit 
The kingdom of god

Face of Evil 
Veiled by a mask
Face of Evil
You'll be revealed one day
