Last night I had a dream
Where every step I used to take 
Lead a second back in time

I knew it was not real
But now, now that I'm awake 
I'm not so sure anymore

When I think of how I felt before...
I was sick, my body frail
But now I'm hale!

No one has seen
The places I have been 
Into my dreams
Exists another universe

My heart it yearns so hard
It's longing for this single dream 
To turn back the hands of time

When I lay down to rest
And close my eyes forevermore 
In this dream live again

When I think of how I felt before...
I was afraid of what might come 
But now I know!

No one has seen
The places I have been 
Into my dreams
Exists another universe

No one has seen
The places I have been 
Into my dreams
Another universe in me
