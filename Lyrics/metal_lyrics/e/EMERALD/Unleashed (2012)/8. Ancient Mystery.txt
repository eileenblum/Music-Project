In our modern society 
In the 21st century 
We do believe

We have all the theories
We can explain all mysteries

There are many who live a lie 
The truth is hidden or they deny 
The verity

There is more than what you see 
Be aware of eternity!

Man. why oh why do you turn away?
Why do you run away?
Why have you gone astray?
Will you ever see?

Science, seeking, trying
Delusive prophets are guiding 
Mankind lost and denying 
Ancient mystery - undying

There's a place beyond our earth
The origin of our mankind's birth
And our home

One answer they will never find 
A mystery, the source of life

Man, why oh why do you turn away?
Why do you run away?
Why have you gone astray?
Will you ever see?

Science, seeking, trying
Delusive prophets are guiding 
Mankind lost and denying 
Ancient mystery - undying
