I am the creature, that doesn't exist
I have no history, I am like mist

No evidence and no prove there is 
For my existence, and yet I live

Hear my music, hear my song 
And you know where you belong

I am the Harleking
Wild and free
Free as a man can be 
Loud I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking 
All night I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking

If you say yes then I say no 
And if you cry then I will laugh

I live your dream and I enjoy 
Your fantasy is my reality

Hear my music. hear my song 
And you know where you belong

I am the Harleking
Wild and free
Free as a man can be 
Loud I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking 
All night I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking

I own the joy, I own the night
It s in my hands to turn the tide
You cannot find me, I don't have to hide
Look forward and throw it all away

I own the joy, I own the night
It's in my hands to turn the tide
You cannot find me, I don't have to hide
Join my world and leave it all behind

I am the Harleking
Wild and free
Free as a man can be 
Loud I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking 
All night I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking

I am the Harleking
Wild and free
Free as a man can be 
Loud I sing
Cause I'm the Harleking

I own the joy, I own the night 
It's in my hands to turn the tide 
You can't find me, I don't hide 
Join me, leave it all behind

I am your fantasy 
I am beyond reality 
I am your fantasy 
I am beyond reality
