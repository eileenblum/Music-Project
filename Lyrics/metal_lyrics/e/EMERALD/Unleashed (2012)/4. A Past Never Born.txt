Every day I wake up lying on the floor
I know it will be a day like all my days were before

I am alone but there is a dark something in me 
A thronging voice, and it won't leave me be

I curse these shadows that are clutching at my heart 
But I am too weak now to search for a new start

I know it's too late to turn back the hands of time 
Soon comes the day I'll just fade away and die 
And when I'm falling asleep forevermore
I will remember a past never born

When I turned thirteen, it's when my fate took its course
The day I lost childhood innocence I remember with remorse

Now I am sitting on the snow-clad curb stone
God if you can hear me, please don't leave me alone

I know it's too late to turn back the hands of time 
Soon comes the day I'll just fade away and die 
And when I'm falling asleep forevermore
I will remember a past never born

Now I am just dreaming
Of a new dawn
Where my heart is whole
Not scarred and torn

The day draws nearer
A herald of the end
My life shall he a monument
To you my friends

Now I see clearer
What I gave away
I am aware I'm lost
I've gone astray

When my time has gone by
Angels will mourn
For a wasted life
A past never born
