For centuries we were sleepwalking - Without light 
Guided by fear - So much sorrow and misery
We were lost - Our time had not come

Kings and emperors in the palm of their hand - Without fear 
Religion in control of all the world - Acting under orders

But more and more of us awakened - Brave!
Courageous we stand
To fight for all and fight for freedom
And we look (discard the book, take a look) without fear

Into the eye of the serpent

We recognize the game
We will change the rules now
Our numbers increase every day
Well retake all control
Now we fight for genuine freedom

And we look without fear
Into the eye of the serpent
Were no longer afraid
The veil has been lifted
The charm has been broken

Discovering the world beneath the surface - Enlightened mind
Crack genetic codes

The moment of truth - Is finally here
The secrets of the moon now lay exposed for us to see

But more and more of us awakened - Brave!
Courageous we stand
To fight for all and fight for freedom
And we look (discard the book, take a look) without fear

Into the eye of the serpent
