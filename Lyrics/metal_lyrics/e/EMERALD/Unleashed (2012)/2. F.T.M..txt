I ask myself about the oil disaster 
Are we so blind that we cannot see? 
I ask myself about the financial crisis 
Are we all fools that ignore the truth?

If you wanna see the truth
F T.M.
If you wanna look behind the lies
F.T.M.

Always the same names
At the end of the line
Always the same malicious games they play 
We do not realize
We must wake up and see
Our social malady is to Follow The Money

All the wars... Just for money 
All the injustice...
All the misery... Just for money 
All the suffering...

I ask myself about the reign of terror 
Are we so blind that we cannot see?
I ask myself about the power of the industry 
Are we all fools that ignore the truth?

If you wanna see the truth
F T.M.
If you wanna look behind the lies
F.T.M.

Always the same names
At the end of the line
Always the same malicious games they play 
We do not realize
We must wake up and see
Our social malady is to Follow The Money
