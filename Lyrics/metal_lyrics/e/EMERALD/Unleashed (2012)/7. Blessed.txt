Ignoring danger, they see no threat 
We're strolling on the path of death

Exploiting nature, a wreckful progress
But still they make us believe that we are blessed

Blessed by the light 
When nuclides unite 
Blessed by the light 
Posterity in blight 
Blessed by a might 
That irradiates the night 
Blessed by the light 
Contamination for all mankind

Devastation wrought by the hand of man 
An invisible monster is eroding the land

Only time will tell
The mutation of our human cells

Creeping death 
Befalls us all

As we are leading a life in excess
They'll always make us believe that we are blessed

Blessed by the light 
When nuclides unite 
Blessed by the light 
Posterity in blight 
Blessed by a might 
That irradiates the night 
Blessed by the light 
Contamination for all mankind
