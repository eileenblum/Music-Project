How can I stop that burning fire deep inside
I can feel that it's searching it's way out
How shall I show you my feelings I use to hide
They won't turn out - alone
I have to find a way to confess my love to you
I think I cannot stand it any longer
Must overcome my fear
When you're standing next to me
I won't be no fool anymore
I don't wanna walk away
With a broken heart
Come on girl make up your mind
When you hold me tight
In your arms tonight
I'll never let you go
When I'm feeling your heart's beating next to mine
Then I close my eyes and I realize
That you were made for me
Together we will spend our lifes you will see
You belong to me
I must overcome all of my doubts
I need more self-confidence
And that's what it's all about
It's all about me and you
Me and you
Please don't let me all alone
See the tears in my eyes
Girl you know it hurts so strong
Don't you realize
When you hold me tight
In your arms tonight
I'll never let you go
When I'm feeling your heart's beating next to mine
Then I close my eyes and I realize
That you were made for me
Together we will spend our lifes you will see
You belong to me
