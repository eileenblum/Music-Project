Now our time has come to pay
The eagle will lead our way
Let the crusade for metal begin
With "The Emerald" as our sign we'll win
We're brothers bound by our desire
Our swords are made out of fire
A metalfire we will ignite
To bring glory to metal we fight
Hail to the metalgods
Hail to all metalmaniacs
Raise your metalfists
Bang your metalheads
We are the Emerald Knights
The defenders of metal and steel
We are the Emerald Knights
In front of the metal gods we kneel
We are the Emerald Knights
Warriors from the start
We are the Emerald Knights
United forever by heart
Our fight is for honour and pride
With thunder and lightning we ride
Like lions we are the defenders
Never will we surrender
With witches and wizards on our side
The beast is rising tonight
Into the metalfire we fly
And metal will never die
Hail to the metalgods
Hail to all metalmaniacs
Raise your metalfists
Bang your metalheads
We are the Emerald Knights
The defenders of metal and steel
We are the Emerald Knights
In front of the metal gods we kneel
We are the Emerald Knights
Warriors from the start
We are the Emerald Knights
United forever by heart
