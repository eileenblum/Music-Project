I watch the lines of our enemies
Bathed in cold sweat I am
So afraid to meet the kiss of steel
I don't want to die, I don't want to die
The first crash is made
By the power of hate
Many men are dead
The ground is gleaming red
We stand as one
And as one we will fall
The nobles sent us all
Into war where innocents fall
But still we stand and fight
For our land and for our rights
Defending our lives with mortal fear
We're standing side by side
Many friends are dying a cruel death
Heroes are falling into the dust
Thus ends the battle
Dead bodies everywhere
Vultures with their dreadful meal
The reaper is laughing still
We stand as one
And as one we will fall
The nobles sent us all
Into war where innocents fall
But still we stand and fight
For our land and for our rights
