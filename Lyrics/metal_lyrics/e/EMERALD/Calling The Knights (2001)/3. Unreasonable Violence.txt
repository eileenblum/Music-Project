Who gives you the right to decide upon life and death
Some government put you in charge, civilians now you can spare
For our country, forcing others to do the dirty work
Megalomaniac greed from your so called leaders
Sitting on your seat commanding, blinding, sewing hate
Innocent minds, believe, risk their lifes or just die
Watching all the injustice that has been done by now
Why is war not so long past, ancient stupidity
Would you kill for glory
Would you close your eyes
All this unreasonable violence
The wrong ones pay the price
Would you kill for glory
Would you close your eyes
All this unreasonable violence
The wrong ones pay the price
I still believe that freedom can be
I still believe in peace
I just can't change the world on my own
Can it be that nothing is learned
Can't you hear my call
And tomorrow, the fighting, it will go on and on and on...
Would you kill for glory
Would you close your eyes
All this unreasonable violence
The wrong ones pay the price
