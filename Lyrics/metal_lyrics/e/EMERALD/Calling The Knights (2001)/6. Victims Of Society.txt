Since your birth
Everybody wants to control your life
You have to do this and you don't have to do this
Everybody has expections for your future
But no one knows your own desires
Your parents want only the best for you
They make plans for your whole life
And so you squander your life in stupid
Schools where you learn so many things
You'll never need again
You have to interrupt this circle
Before it is too late
And you're a victim of society
No more standards-Break the rules!
Everyday you are unhappy with your life
And you waste your time with sorrow and sadness
Problems are getting bigger and bigger
And so you forget
To see the wonderful things in life
You have to interrupt this circle
Before it is too late
And you're a victim of society
No more standards-Break the rules!
