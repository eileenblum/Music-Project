Evil forces have bounded together
Soldiers of the rainbow fight forever
Armies of skeletons, armed and poisonous
Demons and sorcerers are against us
Our stone towers crumbled and fell
Warriors died, on earth there is hell
Shadows appear, where's the helping hand
Shadowknight comes, to save our land
Shadowknight
Fight the dragon with eyes so bright
Shadowknight
Win the war or day turns into night
A sword of steel breaking the bones
Heads being smashed on filthy stones
The land of our king, he's fighting for
Destroy the evil dead, to win this war
Slashing off the head of a demon
Shadowknight appears to be screaming
The last one of the legion is here
The devil's dragon spreading fear
The dragon is dead, killed by him
The evil light disappearing so dim
Look upon the shadowed skies
Our savior, the knight who never dies
Shadowknight
Fight the dragon with eyes so bright
Shadowknight
Win the war or day turns into night
