Memory
Melodies
Silent cries
Shame on the world
Your made me grow up in all that you give
Now, I can't erase my mind
A sign of the stars, point me
To what there is to live for
Can't stare into the moving circles
Making me forget, what I can't stop thinking about
How can it be, through this scattered view
So hard to be true
Dreams
Conceptions
Captured in
And time slowly fades
Still giving me all for nothing at all
Ignorance can't be the key
Twisted truth, cloning reality
Decline and fall
Can't stare into the moving circles
Making me forget, what I can't stop thinking about
How can it be, through this scattered view
So hard to be true
So hard, so hard, so goddamn hard
So hard to be true
