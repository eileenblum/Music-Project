The wind was blowing
The crew prepared for a new adventure
The "Crusader" a royal frigate
Was ready to leave the port
So they sailed away
With hope and pride
In the front the sunrise
And in the back the wind
Across the sea
There are forces we'll never know
When stormes are rising
The sea opens the gate to hell
Then across the sea
There is another world
Across the sea
We're just figures
In an old and mystic game
Played by the ancient gods
With clouds on the horizon
The darkness arrived
Roaring thunder louder than hell
Lightnings like fire in the sky
Water water wherever they look
Screams fade away in the night
Winds of death are blowing over the ship
No one has a chance to survive
Across the sea
There are forces we'll never know
When stormes are rising
The sea opens the gate to hell
Then across the sea
There is another world
Across the sea
We're just figures
In an old and mystic game
Played by the ancient gods
Then across the sea
There is another world
Across the sea
We're just figures
In an old and mystic game
Played by the ancient gods

Sometimes
When a thick fog is hanging over the water-surface
Only the ripple of water is in the air
Old wood es creaking
Then the "Crusader" is returning from the depths of sea into the pitch-black night...
