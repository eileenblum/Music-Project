A scream in the night
Another innocent child bestial killed
Satisfaction in his eyes
With an unquenched lust for blood

They put him into psychiatry
Where they tried to heal him
For thousands of dollars
And 10 years later, he leaves the institute as a "healthy man"

[Chorus:]
There is no prison on this world
For men like him
Let the lightning strike
Death is the only way for justice

His soul is black as hell
And his evil instinct lightens up anew
The next victim raped and ripped up
A ten year old girl on her way back home

A scream in the night
Another innocent child bestial killed
Satisfaction in his eyes
With an unquenched lust for blood

[Chorus:]
There is no prison on this world
For men like him
Let the lightning strike
Death is the only way for justice
