I didn't think about
Finding to your heart and soul
Because you seemed unreachable
Unreachable for my love

You changed my life so much
I really care about tomorrow
Can we exist, you and I
Without pain, without sorrow

Even when you're old
I'll always take care of you
I promise..
I promise

[Chorus:]
You and I
Together we master our lives
In good and in bad times
I'll always stay by your side

Everytime I hold you in my arms
I feel this magic spirit
I don't wanna let you go, never let you go
Never let you go alone

Even when you're old
I'll always take care of you
I promise..
I promise

[Chorus:]
You and I
Together we master our lives
In good and in bad times
I'll always stay by your side
