It's time for a change
Let my dream come true
If we don't take it now
It will be too late
Starting the engine
Gasoline is in the air
The wheels starts burning
Far away thunder is rising

[Chorus:]
So take my hand
And we ride into the sunset
Our hearts will burn like fire
We'll be forever free

Down this highway
From coast to coast
Living from day to day
No more problems or sorrow anymore
We follow the eagle
In the sky
Together we are strong
Noone can stop us

[Chorus:]
So take my hand
And we ride into the sunset
Our hearts will burn like fire
We'll be forever free
