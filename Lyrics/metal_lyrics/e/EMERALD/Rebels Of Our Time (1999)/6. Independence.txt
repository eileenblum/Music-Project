I'm sitting in this bar
A beer in front of me
She's talking about a lot of things
But I'm absorbed in thought

Former we were here
At the same fuckin' place
Yeah we had a lot of fun together
We didn't care about anything

I know that it's a long time ago
But to me it's like yesterday

[Chorus:]
Hey I will remember
These days we were together
I will remember
All the good times we had
I will remember
No one can steal me these memories

Time is passing by so quickly
What was going on in our minds
Why do we now go separate ways
We didn't use our chance

Now it's too late for us
Everyone has his own life now
Nothing lasts forever, but I hope
That you also remember sometimes...

I know that it's a long time ago
But to me it's like yesterday

[Chorus:]
Hey I will remember
These days we were together
I will remember
All the good times we had
I will remember
No one can steal me these memories
