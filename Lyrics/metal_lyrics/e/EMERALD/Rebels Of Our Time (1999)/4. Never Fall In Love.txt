Me and you
We could have had the paradise on earth
Every single day was like a gift from above
Our hearts were connected
Together as one

You told me lies
It hurts me like a thorn in my eyes
A thorn in my eyes
You won't believe it
But it does

[Chorus:]
Never fall in love with someone
Because you never know
Who's behind the mask
Behind the mask of seduction
Never fall in love

You deprived me of my confidence
I don't know
Whom can I trust
Why did you do this to me?
Tell me!

[Chorus:]
Never fall in love with someone
Because you never know
Who's behind the mask
Behind the mask of seduction
Never fall in love

Maybe it's best for us all
You go your way and I go mine
And we won't meet again
Never again
But one thing I've learned...

[Chorus:]
Never fall in love with someone
Because you never know
Who's behind the mask
Behind the mask of seduction
Never fall in love
