Oh no
Oh, God, where am I now
Why can't I recognise this place?
It's not the same
It is not the same
Before I closed my eyes
It wasn't such a mess

This is the isle of emptiness
This is the isle of emptiness

[Chorus:]
Is this real?
(Is this real)
The answer I seek
(The answer I seek from you)
Scared like hell's around
Show me the way home
Or just let me go

Or just let me go

Blind eyes can't read lines to deaf ears
We cannot hear this
We have lost the horizon
I cannot breathe
Out of sight
Out of mind
It's hidden here
It appears in my dreams
Gatekeepers, tell me if it's real

[Chorus:]
Is this real?
(Is this real)
The answer I seek
(The answer I seek from you)
Scared like hell's around
Show me the way home
Or just let me go

I stand alone

On this isle
Of emptiness

[Chorus:]
Is this real?
(Is this real)
The answer I seek
(The answer I seek from you)
Scared like hell's around
Show me the way home
Or just let me...
