Whispering voices
Next to my ear
Undefined forces
Could I be free
Sort out the sky
Define the lies
Eating up all their shit
I draw the line
I draw the line

The message isn't clear
Where are the words I need to hear
I hear no sound, no meaning
Against the wall I'm screaming

[Chorus:]
A signal flies
Through bloodshot eyes
They hide the signs
Behind the lines
To spread the lie
The message isn't clear
Where are the words I need to hear from you
Could you please repeat
What are they telling me

I've been stuck here for a while
How could I rewind
What should I change this time
Feet on the ground
Eyes to the sky

I'll show you the exit
I'll show you the exit
Making my way out
The message isn't clear
Where are the words I need to hear
I hear no sound, no meaning
Against the wall I'm screaming

[Chorus:]
A signal flies
Through bloodshot eyes
They hide the signs
Behind the lines
To spread the lie
The message isn't clear
Where are the words I need to hear from you
Could you please repeat
What are they telling me

What are they telling me
Repeat, repeat
What are they telling me
Repeat, repeat

What are they telling me
Repeat, repeat
What are they telling me
Repeat, repeat
