All the bridges are burned
The trails behind run cold
It's an unseen world
The sight before me
Is getting bright and clear

I am beginning to see the end
The end of questions from the heart of swarm
Gaia drags me back to the roots
To the roots
I want to stay with the truth
And my revelation
To not leave the undoubted
The only cure is to rally the remaining
And this time we make our own rules
We're through with this
With all of you
We're through with this
With all of you

[Chorus:]
This is where I want to be
Looking back
To what I used to see
An unseen world
A new found me

[Chorus:]
This is where I want to be
Looking back
To what I used to see
An unseen world
A new found me

They can take my body
But my mind is
What no man can have

This won't be happening
As long as I breathe
The sight before me
Is getting bright and clear

[Chorus:]
This is where I want to be
Looking back
To what I used to see
An unseen world
A new found me

[Chorus:]
This is where I want to be
Looking back
To what I used to see
An unseen world
A new found me
