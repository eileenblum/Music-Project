I'm a mess
I cannot get out of this
Hear the white noise call
Still locked behind the great walls
How long will I survive
My time is up
Hold my hand
Take me back
Turning hourglass

[Chorus:]
Here we are
Standing still
Looking ourselves
In a timeless wind

[Chorus:]
Here we are
Standing still
Looking ourselves
In a timeless wind

It's a reminder
It is a punishment
It's a way that I could live again
One chance for me to say
I will break the chain

It's a way
That I could live again
Eye to eye I say
I will break the chain

It's a way
(It's a way)
That I could live again
(That I could live again)
Eye to eye I say
(Eye to eye I say)
I will break the chain
(I will break the chain

[Chorus:]
Here we are
Standing still
Looking ourselves
In a timeless wind

[Chorus:]
Here we are
Standing still
Looking ourselves
In a timeless wind

Tear down these walls
Set us free
Do what you can
For the will of the free

Tear down these walls
(These walls)
Set us free
(Set me free)
Do what you can
For the will of the free

Tear down these walls
(These walls)
Set us free
(Set me free)
Do what you can
For the will of the free

[Chorus:]
Here we are
Standing still
Looking ourselves
In a timeless wind

[Chorus:]
Here we are
Standing still
Looking ourselves
In a timeless wind
