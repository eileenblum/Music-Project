This alarm is ready, set, go
Summon the heroes
There's been a terrible accident
There's been a terrible accident

[Chorus:]
Can you see the light from the ocean
With your eyes closed
You feel this tension grow
Can you hear the sound from beneath
With your ears shut
The pressure overflows

Gather all remaining forces
Shelter the strength of all the
Aimless people running around and round
Makes me feel
They're only chasing someone else's life

[Chorus:]
Can you see the light from the ocean
With your eyes closed
You feel this tension grow
Can you hear the sound from beneath
With your ears shut
You feel this tension

Just try

Call for help
Just plead guilty
Call for help
Just take the measures

Cry heaven, cry
Change this pond into an ocean
Into an ocean

Cry heaven, cry
Change this pond into an ocean
Into an ocean
Just cry
