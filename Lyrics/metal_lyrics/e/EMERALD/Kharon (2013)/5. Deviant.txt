I don't know where you're at
Can you please enlighten me
I'm running towards you
With no destination
I'm running
I'm running

Curse me away
And make me feel
That we are not the same

Curse me away
And make me feel
That we are not the same

The path seems so unclear
My glasses are turning vague
Is this all that you left for me to see
To see the black plague

Bwah

I am not the same anymore
Keep safe from me
I'm not quite here
I cannot control the temptation
Of craving you
Of craving you

Curse me away
And make me feel
That we are not the same

Curse me away
And make me feel
That we are not the same

Oh, I cannot see you
Please help me out now
I cannot see you
Please help me out
My eyes burn
Don't let the light burn out

Don't let the light burn out
