I decided to head back home
Lies lurking between crashing waves
I cannot get sleep
I can't wake up either
Obey you say
But you cannot grasp
You can't read the signs

[Chorus:]
Sunrise will cut like glass
Cries of the past
Survivors will go down
As names on the stone

Open up your eyes and ears
Take notice
Show no fear
No mercy
No pain release
You are the ones who'll pull this through
Your raft stays unbroken
Shore close at reach

Don't let them trample on your head
Fight as long as you can
Take a hold of yourself
Don't let them in your head

[Chorus:]
Sunrise will cut like glass
Cries of the past
Survivors will go down
As names on the stone

Oh

You're falling on your knees
The horizon darkens

You're falling on your knees
The horizon darkens

You're falling on your knees
They're the lords of the northern sea
Survivors who did last
Sunrise will cut like glass
Come wounds, comes a fist of resistance
