Bruises on the wrist
Everything is done by a list
No mistakes are allowed in here
Fill in the blanks
Replacements
No mistakes are allowed in here

[Chorus:]
We are machines that feed the masters
Our blood is fueling the fear
We are machines that feed the masters
Our blood is fueling the fear
We are machines that feed the masters

Ankles aching
Backs are breaking
Shaking hands
Machines are our new lords
No freedom in this blinded heaven
Humanity is taken

[Chorus:]
We are machines that feed the masters
Our blood is fueling the fear
We are machines that feed the masters
Our blood is fueling the fear
We are machines that feed the masters
Our blood is fueling the fear
We are the masters
Our blood is fueling the fear

Storm of blades is rising from the earth
Storm of blades is rising from the earth
The only safe place is in our heads
The only safe place is in our heads
We are already dead
We are already dead
We're dead
