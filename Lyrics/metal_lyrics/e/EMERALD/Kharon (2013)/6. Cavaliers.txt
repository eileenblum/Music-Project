I see the cavaliers coming after me
Four pawns of the end

They all call me
To let me know my blame
I've got to understand what I really see
For we're made to swim
With the flow of the river

At the end of the day
All that counts is hope
Of escaping thee
Are we scared to leave
Just like leaves in the storm
Like leaves in the storm

[Chorus:]
Push me away so I can remain
This rotation keeps us still
Push me away so I can remain
This rotation keeps us still

I see the cavaliers
Four pawns of the end

Go inside I say
Go inside I say
Go hide yourself, mate
Go hide yourself

[Chorus:]
Push me away so I can remain
This rotation keeps us still
Push me away so I can remain
This rotation keeps us still

(This rotation keeps us still)
(I can remain out here)

(Push me away so I can remain)
(This rotation keeps us still)
(Push me away so I can remain)
(This rotation keeps us still)
(Push me away so I can remain)
(This rotation keeps us still)
