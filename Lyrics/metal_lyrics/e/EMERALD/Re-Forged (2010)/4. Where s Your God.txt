"Kneel down and pray
Kneel down and do what we say
For remission of sins, subscribe and pay
You'd better follow the rules or hell awaits"

You always live in anxiety
To comply with the orders of a church decree
Never ask who wrote these rules for men
Never ask who benefits by them

Time is passing by
A life as slave to man-made rules

Where's your god?
Don't look at the church
Where's your god?
Don't look to the sky
Where's your god?
Just look inside you!
Where's your god?
God's in you!

"Obey to me
Obey or you won't be free
Your blind devotion is the key
To save your soul eternally"

Judging others is the easy way
In the name of the cross they damn and slay
Ignoring nature and the miracle of life
Heaven and hell, here on earth, made by mankind

Time is passing by
A life as slave to man-made rules

Where's your god?
Don't look at the church
Where's your god?
Don't look to the sky
Where's your god?
Just look inside you!
Where's your god?
God's in you!

Where is god? Not in a church
Where is god? Not in a temple of gold
Where is god? Feel it deep inside
Where is god? God's in you!

Where's your god?
God's in you!
