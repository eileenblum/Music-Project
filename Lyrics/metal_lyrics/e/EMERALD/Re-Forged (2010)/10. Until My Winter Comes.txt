I remember bygone days
Dreams were blooming like an aster in the haze
In the springtide of my life
There was convincement my desires all would thrive

Then the winds were getting bleaker
But my hopes didn't wither away

Seas may roar
And storms may scourge the shore
Trees may bow
As they wait in fear for snow
Leaves may fall
Cause they obey the autumn's call
But though time runs
An aster stands tall until the winter comes

Summer passed away so fast
Safe in the knowledge that an aster still would last
Though the days got gray and cold
I'm still wondering what boon life will unfold

Though the winds are getting bleaker
My hopes won't wither away

Seas may roar
And storms may scourge the shore
Trees may bow
As they wait in fear for snow
Leaves may fall
Cause they obey the autumn's call
But though time runs
An aster stands tall until the winter comes

Until my winter comes...
