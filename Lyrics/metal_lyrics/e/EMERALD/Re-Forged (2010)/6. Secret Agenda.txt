You should be afraid of terrorism and extremists
A permanent danger - New pandemics
Misery and distress in the third world countries
The climate change, the world's new worries

âDear citizen of this free country
We have fantastic solutions for all your problems!"

Camera eyes everywhere, the eye in the sky
Microchip implants for everyone, don't ask why
Gene mutated food and seed
Ordered mass inoculations, now we lead

You don't want these fantastic solutions?
Soon you will beg for them!"

It is already too late
Our temptations encouraged you
The apocalypse is due

The old plan - Near to completion
Mankind is slaved - Invisible chains
Freedom and democracy - The perfect delusion
Secret Agenda - World's intrusion
Secret Agenda - No illusion
Secret Agenda - World's intrusion!

All the different religions - an endless fight
We reign from other dimensions, out of your sight
Soon humanity awakes and smells the fuse
We changed the code of law, no more chance to accuse

âAll sheeps into the stable now, one after the other
Get yourself your brand, the mark of your new master"

It is already too late
Our temptations encouraged you
The apocalypse is due

The old plan - Near to completion
Mankind is slaved - Invisible chains
Freedom and democracy - The perfect delusion
Secret Agenda - World's intrusion
Secret Agenda - No illusion
Secret Agenda - World's intrusion!

The world is a madhouse near the last hour
All hungry for riches, recognition and power
Humanity - a lost and blind mass
Such an easy game for us

The old plan - Near to completion
Mankind is slaved - Invisible chains
Freedom and democracy - The perfect delusion
Secret Agenda - World's intrusion
Secret Agenda - No illusion
Secret Agenda - World's intrusion!

Secret Agenda - To destroy the light
Secret Agenda - To slave mankind
Secret Agenda - To reign over you!
