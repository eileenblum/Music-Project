Unconcluded days of old
Don't come back, the story's told

Still they stay in my life
Like a part made to fit
The spirit has survived
And returns to come alive

Are we bound by our desire?
Can the spark revive the fire?

We might fail in the end
And would have to move on
Fate cannot pretend
Our future we'll defend

The time is here
I will not fear
To choose my path

Embrace the light
Rejoin the fight
We are standing tall
So we will not fall

To the Mark of the Beast

Get down on your knees
Be grateful to the gods
We get a chance to be born again
If we deny the profane sign

The Mark of the Beast
