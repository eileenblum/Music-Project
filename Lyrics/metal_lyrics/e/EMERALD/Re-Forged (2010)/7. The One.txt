Forces of doom
Turned our world into ash
An empire of endless gloom
Heading for the final clash

Seeking for the one
Who divides the dark from the light
Even though all hope had gone
His presence expels the fright

Drums of doom awaiting the hour
To herald the gloom
They will roar soon...

Standing alone
On these fields of war
He'll carry on
The truth forevermore

All by his own
Following destiny
In the unknown
We'll perceive
He is... The One

Lying in wait
Under the darkened sky
Ready to devastate
The spawn of lie

Through the valley of shadows
The evil troops shall reach
Onto these once green meadows
Where the one waits in his breach

Drums of doom awaiting the hour
To herald the gloom
They will roar soon...

Standing alone...

Fuelled by anger, but without hate
Defeating one by one
His will to resist will never fade
Until this fight is won

Standing alone...
