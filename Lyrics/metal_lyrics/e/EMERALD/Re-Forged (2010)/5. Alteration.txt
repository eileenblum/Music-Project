From our birth until our death
We are constrained to adapt
the dogmas of society

We must exploit our life
And burst our chains of duty
Let us break out!

Forget all expectations
We are free and here to live
and experience

Your life will turn
Your world will change
Life is so short
Don't waste your time

Did you know you are diseased?
Your infect is an illness
Which we all call death

Therefore use your energy
Savour every moment of your time

Forget all expectations
We are free and here to live
and experience

Your life will turn
Your world will change
Life is so short
Don't waste your time
