A fierce force took possession of my mind
Letting in all the wicked thoughts and greed
Keeping out all the signals of warning
Subconsciously I stay forever in her need

Oh... Oh.... Caught in Witches Tower
Oh... Oh.... Subdue to her power
Oh... Oh... Lost in witches fortress
Oh... Oh.... Be slave to her caress
until the final hour

Many men before were trying to escape her
One by one she left them lying in the dust
Hooked, the minute she eyes upon her victim
You can take her up, but never handle her lust

Oh... Oh.... Caught in Witches Tower
Oh... Oh.... Subdue to her power
Oh... Oh... Lost in witches fortress
Oh... Oh.... Be slave to her caress
until the final hour

I sneak in with a sword to strike her dead
She would not wither me with a glance
Win or die, I credit this to my bravery
Suddenly her burning gaze takes me back
to the trance

Oh... Oh.... Caught in Witches Tower
Oh... Oh.... Subdue to her power
Oh... Oh... Lost in witches fortress
Oh... Oh.... Be slave to her caress
until the final hour
