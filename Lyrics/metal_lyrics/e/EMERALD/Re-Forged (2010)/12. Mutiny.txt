Darkness swaps over our ship
The night falls and replaces the whip
Tyranny is the captain's name
Torture is his favourite game
But I won't close my eyes no longer
I won't close my eyes no longer

Quick wake our men and tell them to
Fight with us or die with the captain
There is no other choice
And if they stir some noise
Then strike them down to death
Strike them down to death

Light the torch, load the gun
Kill the guards who stand against us
Known faces, comrades of yesterday
Their loyalty is their doom

Unlock the door of the weaponry
Take gun, powder and sabre
Get armed - be prepared
Be ready for the final battle

I smell gun powder
The sound of clashing iron fills the air
Blood spills around
Bodies covering the ground

Oppression has to find an end
I'll break this tyranny
Oppression has to find an end
I'll break this tyranny

Fight with us
Or die with them
Mutiny
Take over the ship
Gun powder in the air
Ending this nightmare
For our freedom
For our freedom

Time for steel - time for blood
Cutâem down, a bloody harvest
Open fire - no one shall be spared
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth

Swarm on deck as vengeful sailors
Storm the wardroom - a sanguinary pack
Kill the officers, enchain the captain
We're ending now this brutal regime

I smell gun powder
The sound of clashing iron fills the air
Blood spills around
Bodies covering the ground

Oppression has to find an end
I'll break this tyranny
Oppression has to find an end
I'll break this tyranny

Fight with us
Or die with them
Mutiny
Take over the ship
Gun powder in the air
Ending this nightmare
For our freedom
For our freedom

Taste your whip -
I took over your ship
Taste your whip -
I took over your ship
Taste your whip -
I took over your ship
Taste your whip -
I took over your ship

The reaper is dancing to the final clash of steel
A last drop of blood spills over the planks
The moon is shining through the lifting smoke
Tired and wounded, but conquered we have

Outlaws - now - hunted and despised
Though - alive - and free
In our hands - the ship - and our destiny
We - will sail - to new horizons

Fight with us
Or die with them
Mutiny -
Take over the ship
Gun powder in the air
Ending this nightmare
For our freedom
For our freedom
