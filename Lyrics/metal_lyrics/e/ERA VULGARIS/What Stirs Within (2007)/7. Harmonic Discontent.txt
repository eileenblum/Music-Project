I lie beneath my emotions
Aligning childhood mysteries
Knowing not my own needs
I perpetuate your legacy

I lie beneath my emotions
Aligning childhood mysteries
Knowing not my own needs
I perpetuate your legacy

Forgiveness has cleansed my soul
From the sunless dawn âtil evening
At last I have found my own light

Discontent with harmony
Faulting the way things had to be
Now I cast the stone at me
As your actions by my hands repeat

Discontent with harmony
Faulting the way things had to be
Now I cast the stone at me
As your actions by my hands repeat

Forgiveness has cleansed my soul
From the sunless dawn âtil evening
At last I have found my own light

I am my own master
I am my own father
By me I am matured
My peace I have structured

I am my own master
I am my own father
By me I am matured
My peace I have structured

Forgiveness has cleansed my soul
From the sunless dawn âtil evening
At last I have claimed my own life
