So long the beast attacked, claws piercing and abandoned soul
Too long I turned my back, tried passing on responsibility
Sought answers in the world around me, everywhere but the place they would be
Thought that the freak could save me, that her words could see me free

Though you may tear me limb from limb
Youâll never kill what stirs within

So the angels danced in vain on his barren unmarked grave
For the beast still roamed at will, just waiting for his time to kill
I have known no other way, puppet strings bear my weight
Surely I will fall if they are cut, certain death if they are not

I see how he controls me
Arrogance is the chain that holds me down

[Lead 1, 3 &amp; 5: Robertson]

[Lead 2, 4 &amp; 6: Kent]

Attacks logged and remembered, re-grown the limbs it severed
Only the weak do not surpass deeds attempted in the past
The beast feeds upon my weakness but when I wake he will rot in pieces
Donât look too hard for destiny, someone elseâs you will find
