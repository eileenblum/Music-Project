Hasta siempre la revoluciÃ³n
Now keep the wheels in motion
Do what must be done
Join the battle lines
Hear what has begun
This is my time, this is our time

Iâve heard all your complaining
Your insights and explaining
Until you look inside
Youâll never realize
The wrongs perpetrated by them are related
What caused them to fall
At sometime afflicts us all
We must show them

Donât let yourself be lead
By what the blind have said
Forgive but donât forget
Donât waste time on regret
See just how much hate is our crutch
Take the higher path
Guarding well your wrath
We must show them
Donât give into temptation
And fall into complacence
Revolution is a process
Not a product
Learn from the past, this time it lasts
Understand the weak
Donât realize what we seek
We must show them
