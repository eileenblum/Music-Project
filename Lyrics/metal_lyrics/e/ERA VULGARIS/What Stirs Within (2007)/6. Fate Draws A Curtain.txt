Fear has ruled and ruined my life
My soul was blind and I paid the price
Beauty defiles, happiness cries
A shadow grows if the sleeper lies

I canât pass it on, though Iâve tried, I can only blame myself
Motivated by fear and all the lies it has spoken
Only now that Iâve paid do I see what I couldnât tell
Deep inside from its slumber the sleeper must awaken

Fear is the mind killer

Strip away the lies, kill my pride
Discover honesty is not fear in disguise
Love defiles, destiny cries
A shadow grows while the sleeper lies
Never forget
Nothing is certain
Over our future
Fate draws a curtain
The old winkled couple
May still have a chance
My dream never dies
Of those paper like hands

Fortune flies blind
Punished for her crimes
Passes me by
In the darkest of my times
Nothing to lose
Peace at lat to gain
Where are you now?
I held you through your pain

Passing through fire
Emerging a new man
My dream never dies
Of your freezing hands

[Lead: Robertson]

You closed the door on my heart, opened the window to my soul
Honesty is a virtue whose powers Iâve not known
Now the truth is all that can save me, atone the lies that were told
And I wish that I could hold you as my life turns upside down

[Lead: Kent]

I canât pass it on, though Iâve tried, from the truth I cannot run
Motivated by fear when all hope is forsaken
Only now that Iâve paid can I do what must be done
Deep inside from its slumber the sleeper has awakened
