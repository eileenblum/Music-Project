You told me what I should believe
But I will not listen to you anymore
You told me what you wanted me to feel
But I will not bow down to you or anyone

This is the voice of one who knows
These are the eyes which have seen
These are the ears with which I heard
This is the mind that bears the scars

Follow no one
Follow no man

You told me my father was in hell
And there was nothing I could do for him
You preached love with an iron fist
And I raised the iron finger as a hypocrite

You pushed God into a box
Placed him on an altar high and said
âThis is God and this is why you will born after you dieâ
