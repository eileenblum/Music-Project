Just like the crab struck with legs in the air
And just like the worm thatâs been caught in the sun
The way is clear but you wonât brave the stair
Pull the wool over your eyes satisfied
There was nothing that you could have done

There but for the grace of God I would lie
And there for the likes of you I would die

This is a story thatâs not mine to tell
Passed on by one too bitter to speak
A shriveled spirit in a self-made hell
Tears distort vision where hope will not seek

Greed made you turn on your closest friend
Rejected love for a trinket of gold
Who knew that reason could so easily rend
To unseen forces your soul was sold

Just like brittle bones youâve got a brittle soul
Psychoporosis, you need to make you whole

[Solo: Kent]

How can I help you? You wonât help yourself
Expect to receive but youâre not willing to give
They seek your death, still why you canât tell
Examine yourself, would you let you live?
