You refuse to improve because itâs safer down there
Never ventured, never gained
You pull others down into your pit
Here ends your little game

Always something new
Different perspective, same view
Changing your position
Wonât improve the situation

You make me sick when I see the
Boulder on your back
Shoulder searching eyes
Colder side of the track
Our sympathy for your lies

Communist hypocrite, degenerate fuck
Liar, arrogant fool
Donât talk about what you donât understand
In fact, donât talk at all

Iâve seen what youâve seen
I know what you know
Iâve been where youâve been
Thereâs no excuse

[Lead: Robertson]

This was the best chance that you ever had
To rise up and transcend
But you bit the hand and left us no choice
So this is the end
