Ignorance is enlightening
Vermin seeking intelligence
Force fed all of your beliefs
"Please let this barrel bring me relief"

Get on your knees &amp; clasp your hands
Pray to your lamb
Let your blood shed
Cover the walls in crimson red
Tell your God you're better off dead

Sacrifice
Your life
To your own God
Justified

Preach about free will
Yet you baptize the infants without a choice
[2x]
Corrupted cult bathing in sin
Diluted by your facade of commandments

Pray to your disease mother fucker

Brainwash the youth with filth
Lead them a life of bigotry
Create your army of disciples
&amp; slit the throats of those who don't agree

You were supposed to deliver us from evil yet you brought it upon them
Remove yourself from this ministry
Remove yourself from this life

Before your brain blows you'll pray to your holy spirit
With futile attempts to ask for last minute forgiveness
If God was real he'd look down on you &amp; shrug
Why the fuck would he save you?
Your blackened soul will lead you straight to Hell
No sermon left for you to spew

Pray to your disease mother fucker
Rot in Hell you putrid sack of meat
