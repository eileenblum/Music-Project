[feat. Bryan of Dealey Plaza]Tear out my eyes
For I can still see the truth
I miss the bliss of ignorance
[2x]

My monsters will rise
My demons will thrive

On broken hearts
&amp; past mistakes
[2x]

I know what I'm capable of
&amp; the anger's piling up
[2x]

He can't help himself
Crawling his way out
Emerging from the inside
[2x]

He has risen [2x]

[Bryan]
Blood on her head
Blood on her hands
Death for her serpent's eye that commands
Heaven &amp; starlight or Hellfire &amp; fear
The choice is her's the ruins loom near
