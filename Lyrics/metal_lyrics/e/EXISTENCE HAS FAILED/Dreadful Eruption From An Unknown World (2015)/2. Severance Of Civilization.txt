[feat. Tyler of Traitors]How can we live in a world full of such hate &amp; greed?
If we keep this up we will surely not last
[2x]

We can't go on living like this [2x]

We've crossed the line between
Humanity &amp; savagery

With our feral minds
There is no way that we will get out alive
We've lost our way [2x]

Sodomize the swine [2x]

Kill the pigs
Slit their throat
Spill the blood
[2x]

With our feral minds
There is no way that we will get out alive

The sight of blood it seems to fucking arouse them
What the Hell have we become?

[Tyler]
There is no law &amp; order

Corruption has seized us all

[Tyler]
Violence is spreading like a mother fucking plague
Fuck

The dreadful eruption from an unknown world
Echoes forever in my mind
Crimson red pools around my bare feet
As I tear out its fucking spine

Choking
Squealing
The fucking swine always dies
