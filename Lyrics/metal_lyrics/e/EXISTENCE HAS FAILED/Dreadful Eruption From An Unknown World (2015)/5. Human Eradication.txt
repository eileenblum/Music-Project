[feat. Dan of Enterprise Earth]I feel them watching us
Their eyes are filled with disgust
They're all around us &amp; there's no one to trust
We feel them watching us
Their eyes are filled with disgust
They're all around us &amp; there's no one to trust

Murder the human race
Mass annihilation is the final phase
Desolation the ending stage
A plan set in motion

Put us out of our misery [2x]
For good

Take a look in the mirror
Do you really deserve to live?

Decades of wait
We are bound to our fate
The faces of the imploded
Our world in ruins
Forever eroded

Some form of outside beings
Are controlling our future
While you pray to a God who is only plotting against you
Not a single fucking trace &amp; they'll feed us to the pigs [2x]

We no longer have the option to defend ourselves
Dissect the human race
Extinct the world
Begin rebirth

I feel their eyes on me as I fall back to sleep
Despite all my premonitions
They're digging into me
The drill is going in deep
The cuts become forgotten scars

They drag me out of bed
&amp; try to fuck with my head
I know I'm better off dead [2x]

[Dan]
Relinquish me from within
I am your torment
I am the creature
Lurking deep beneath your skin
You gouge out your own eyes
I invite the flies
To lay maggots in your skull
