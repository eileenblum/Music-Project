Shut your filthy fucking mouth &amp; wait until I'm done
Keep talking &amp; I'll slit your throat &amp; I'll rip out your tongue
[2x]

Open your esophagus &amp; spew into your lungs
This is the evil inside me

All your tears &amp; all your pleads are worthless to me now
Fill your lungs with the water so I can watch you drown

Ruthless mutilation [2x]

Fear me for I am the grim reaper
I'll leave your body where the world can see

You no longer need a savior
I'll do the world a fucking favor

I'll get rid of the scum like you
I'll use your entrails as your fucking noose

I didn't know how far you would go
&amp; now I know you are the lowest of low
I didn't know how far you would go
You should have seen this coming
