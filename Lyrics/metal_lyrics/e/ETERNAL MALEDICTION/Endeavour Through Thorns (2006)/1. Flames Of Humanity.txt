[R. Lopes]

The curse of  humanity
Condemned to die in battlefields
The ground forever soaked in blood
Our souls forever turn apart

Global tension strikes
Slay your brother for mankind
Chaos of unnerved religion
Jump into the lake of fire

War just fucking war
Evil takes its place
Skies are falling scorched
Flames of humanity

March!

Trough ages it never changed
Life has no respect
Our violence thought us
To not fear the skies!

Dead mysticism fails
In the coldness of menâs eyes
Aborted from  life
Letâs march to our common fate
