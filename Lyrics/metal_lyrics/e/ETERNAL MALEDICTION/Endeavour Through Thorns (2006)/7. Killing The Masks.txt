[Heverton Souza]

Face him
The enemy of life
Bring it
The enchantment of night
Cross your way
Against all the laws
Fight your own war

Find your own road
Follow your way
From darkness you raise
To live your own fate

Beast of inside
Anger in your mind
Fire around the sky
Blood is on your knife

âLook into my eyes and see
If you cross my road
Iâll no mercy
Iâm âThe King of Meâ
The King
I control my own hell
You never
Never will blind meâ

Face him
The enemy of life
Awake your devil inside
Fight
Youâre a knight
Burn
The pages of lie

Kill the masks of lie
Never be a slave
Follow your bloodline
Break the chains of pain
Break the chains of pain ...
