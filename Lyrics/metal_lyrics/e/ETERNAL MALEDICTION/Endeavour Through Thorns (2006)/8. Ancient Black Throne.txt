[Rafael Souza]

March ...
Knights of war and bravery hail the pennant
We will cure the ignorance for the world
With blood they will have to pay

We will impel the weak and coward ones
The greedy construction of our darkest hell
Even the decrepit ones we must battle

We will never weaken before our new history
We will never weaken before our new history

From all pulpits we will take out your tyrants
There will be no more despotism in your placid margin
To the fold, we will send the Christian mob
So that our future offspring is honest and proud

Donât be another slave, arise
Donât be another slave, arise

You wonât suffer
Your coins will not be the betrayal
Youâll infect no more this noble air
With disdain we will treat your faith
Your fear will feed my children
The pagan hordes will triumph
