[R. Lopes]

Vivid memories I behold
Weakening the will
The will to hold
Only remains the will to resist
Is there even a path to Exist?

The nebula built
a fortress that rises

From my spirit comes
The spectres of the moon
From the abyss rise
The truth never told
From the horizon emerge
The enigma of my soul
From the triumphant dark
They whisper my name

Eternal gates of space shall open and reveal

The equilibrium of the universe
Equally astonishing
and frightening
Scintilla from me to burial ground
In a barren soil

Thrown in sorrow and lust
I conceived the machine
To humanize the dark
I settle itâs throne
And a sentinel I was no more
No more

Hail to the endless no one
Hail to the endless no one
Hail to the endless no one

While the white bright light
Focus on defenseless selfishness
The sheepfold remains untouched

As I wait....
As I wait....
As I wait....

I never prayed to restrain
The Freedom
Your sordid religion consternate

I never prayed to restrain
The Freedom
Your sordid religion consternate

I never prayed to restrain
The Freedom
Your sordid religion consternate

I never prayed to restrain
The freedom
Your sordid religion consternate

Vivid memories I behold
Weakening the will to hold
Only remains the will to resist
Is there even a path to exist?
Exist....
