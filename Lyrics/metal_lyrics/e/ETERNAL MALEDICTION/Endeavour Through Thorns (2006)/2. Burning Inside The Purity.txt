[Heverton Souza]

Scream and tears
Calling for help
Thereâs no god to hear

Cradle of blood
Cradle of death
Innocence is dying here

Admiration for the childâs beauty
Holding the hands of innocence
Caress on the virgin skin
Burning inside all the purity

Drowning in tears lake
Lake of blood tears
Tears that is falling of blood pain
Pain of a violent seed

[Priestâs words:]

come to me kid
to pray with me
you know Iâll never
never hurt you

Sweet child
Get down and pray
Iâm just blessing you

Christian
Open your mouth now

Bleeding
Your tears are falling down

Burning
Your soul is dying now
