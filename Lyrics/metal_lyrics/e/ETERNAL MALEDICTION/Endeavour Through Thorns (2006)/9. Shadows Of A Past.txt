[Heverton Souza]

War spirits
around me
Screaming in my head

My army is
Watching me
Waiting for my Death

In darkness
My nightmare
Please leave me alone

Iâm not the guilty
But I am paying for

Screaming, Bleeding
Memories of my past
My troopers, my demons
Dying by my hands

Them tears are falling
In the fields of Death
The cries of the brides
By the flags of pain

In the darkness
My nightmare
Please leave me alone

Iâm not the guilty
But I am paying for

Sunlight is on my face
Showing me the end of the life
And I canât save them
This damnation I canât disguise
Death is by my side
Maybe it can be the shadows of mine
Fate was in my hands
And I canât
Leave this all away
