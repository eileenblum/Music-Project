[Rafael S.]

A lot of things were not said
And others were left behind
The circle was closed too fast
A half cut line rests

Conflicts were not resolved
Delights were not divided
All that remains to me
Is your face under the darkness

To ashes, the light fades away
So that memories our heart will keep

Hours were hours
But seconds seemed to go by
Like a blink of an eye fades away
Mysteries that obscure my mind

This confusing spiral cannot explain
This confused spiral cannot explain what life is

Secrets... So far away...

At a damned night
He left me alone
The darkest face of life
Still walking around my soul

Nothing will be forgotten
Or pass as waves and wind
The pain that will remain
By my side forever

A shadow, too much rage
Cause youâre not here with me
A shadow, too much rage
Cause youâre not here with me always

Just silence around me
Your whisper in my dreams

Time didnât matter for us
We forgot the days
Twenty years rust in the past
There are no words
No words to say
