"Algo estranho, no ceu tudo escuro
Em minha alma so existem murmurios
Vejo em claro todo o meu preludio
E as cegas , posso ver meu triunfo"

In the ocean i can see...
The blood of the world...

I am the only alive to fight
The ruin is to die
But I'll win with my suicide

I will die
But I'll win
In this battle to be free
You can pray
You can cry
But in the end I'll be the light

The victory is to die
It's the only way
The victory is to die
But will be my way
I can win the fight
That is your disgrace
I will win the fight
And change all the fate

"minha vida voce controlou
ao que eu fazia sentir dor
minha morte me libertou
uma alma livre agora eu sou"

My head in blooding but still right
I'm the lord of my faith
I'm the captain of my soul...
