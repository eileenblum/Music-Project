Some years passed
An awful shine in Ares still resists
Tessalia, in weeping, esteems your children
(that still scream in despair in the black river Cocito )
Quavering of the branches is not heard
Nor the roar of the leaves if sees
As it's impious Notus that doesn't spread
(the drops scarlets that remained to the dew)
A soul is crying
The silence to lay down her in their arms
A dream is inside of the hill
The pain is strong as steel
The iniquity is still in the air
Horsemen executioner dances in the flames
I can feel the happiness of those malicious
That they smiled to each dropped blood
Was livid the look of childhood
In the liquid vital human
Today it remains a single star
Incautious, protecting of the last rose
whispers...
A sweet and sad glance
Emptiness and hardly ever present
She reflects the grass to her side
Destroyed by the breathing of Etna
The tremor of chaos still alive
Taciturn; clamors the voice of fear
Only the ancestry of rose
Keeps the shadow of new world
Alone in the Belona's garden
Veiling withered seeds
A frozen funeral
where the cry is the smile of relief
Some years passed
The dark sky greets the new station
A fine rain, where rays don't transpose
The car sun nor usurps the Aurora's veil
The past buries memories
Where nobody can arrive
The future expelled imaginary lines where, Atropos, will never be able to find
A bird flies until me and says:
The end of blue sphere approaches to every new day
