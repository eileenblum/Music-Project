The curse of humanity
Condemned to die in battlefields
The ground forever soaked in blood
Our souls forever torn apart
Global tension strikes
Slay your brother for mankind
Chaos of an unnerved religion
Jump into the lake of fire
War just fucking war
Evil take its place
Skies are falling scorched
Flames of Humanity
March !
Through ages it never changes
Life has no respect
Our violence thought us
To not fear the skies !
Dead mysticism fails
In the coldness of men's eyes
Aborting from life
Lets march to our common fate
