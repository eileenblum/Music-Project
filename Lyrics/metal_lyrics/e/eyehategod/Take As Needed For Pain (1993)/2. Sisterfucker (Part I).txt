Screw mommy; mommy screwed
Lick golden sky like rain
My sight sees stormweather
Weathered like wood

Peer into glass yellowed
Curtains stained with smoke
Meloncholy crush
In love with hurt the rust

Burn her
Burn her
Burn her

Rape

This ink is dripping
A certain somebody
Whatever these words
Stood for I've gottten over
We live down the road
Things were at their worst
