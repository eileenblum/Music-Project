Uptown mess, downtown wreck
Frostbite sweat, your guilt on fire !
Uptown mess, downtown wreck
Your guilt on fire !
Shoes don't fit, I don't fit
East bank mess, west bank wreck
Shoes don't fit, you don't fit
This shit don't quit, we don't fit
Put down, burned up
Turned back, crept up
Broke down, step down
No way, back door, pissed off
