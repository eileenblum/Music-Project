Empty bottles, empty heads.
Feeling lonely, just the same
Another life, another world
could not made them saved.

Twisted Faces, twisted minds
that plan their own disgrace.
Wicked Ritual, wicked fall
Tragedy like no one ever saw

Empty minds, empty speeches.
Hours of illusions to make up cruelty

Precious treasure wasted down
like made of bones and papers,
Sacred relics of ages past
just broken deviously.

Precious souls that we're gifted
wasted on this giant race that we call life,
Feeling nothing, doing nothing
but to ruin their own kind
