Another empty glass, a meaningless chapter in my life.
A hall of gray moments, wasted and gone.
I need something to save me from nothingness.
An unknown device of substance.

I need to run away from hiding in my shell,
Set my compass to the path of the divine.
Just let the morning light push up your mind,
come with me and meet ourselves.

Aren't you tired of running in circles?
An invisible man in the growing crowd?
Set yourself free from the cold kiss of the blade.
Let's write the prophecies of ages to come

Don't think your history has come to an end,
don't trust the witches of deluges of the past.
If you had the chance to be immortal,
would you hesitate?

In the final steps of your life,
You can always escape from the cycle of lies and decay
In this procedure you are one.

Gliding through your memories to eternity.
Breaking the invisible veil of MÄyÄ.
Into this unknown device of conscience,
Would you hesitate?
If you had the chance to be immortal,
would you hesitate?
