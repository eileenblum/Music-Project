Unspoken, freed from madness.
Noah, drowned by his false truth.
Death revoking the Silver Age.
Let us be molten into mud again.

Neptune, free us from death!
Oceans will be our graveyard
and rain will be our blood!

Free us from temptation fugue,
Leviathan, eternal nemesis.
Blood on water, drowned Earth.
Deluge will spare no one.

We're breathing demons to collapse,
the slayers of humanity.
Tied to ephemeral thoughts of mercy.
So, the end comes again.

El-Gabhel will not dry our sins.
Nor will he save himself,
unbeatable no more.

"(...)And then we see the ocean land.
The throne of men no longer is.
The sand of time won't reach our minds.
Deluge will spare no-one."
