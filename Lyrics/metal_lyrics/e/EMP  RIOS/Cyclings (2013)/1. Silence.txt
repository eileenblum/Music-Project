Through the dead glass
Stumbling in my room
Looking for solutions
Something to brighten up

Sunrise quietly kept
Inside the windowpane
Sunrise quietly stands

Silence awaits for my thoughts to ease
Silence keeps watching me die
Silence wants to calm me down

Through my veins I must feel
The answer I can't resist
As my eyes stop wandering
As my mind stop running

Sunrise quietly kept
Inside the windowpane
Sunrise quietly stands

Silence awaits for my hands to calm
Silence keeps watching me fall
Silence wants to calm me down

I want to see the only way
Fear to be lonely again
Eclipsed by confusion

Silence awaits from the windowpane;
Showing all I want to see;
Silence wants to be one again.
