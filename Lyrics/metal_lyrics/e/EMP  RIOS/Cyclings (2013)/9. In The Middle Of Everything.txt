Liberty to think, freedom of pain.
You didn't even reach the start.
Do my words mean anything to you?
Or are you waiting my voice to fade away?

So self-assured, so full of pride.
I bet You'll never come as far.
This nightmare life you try to fit in.
There's a time to end all your complaints.

In the middle of everything
you may try to find me.
In the heart of the sunrise you'll see

Don't you try to ruin me,
I have not reach the end.
Left aside, Suicide.
Trace one line and follow it.

Don't you try to run with lies,
I know you're scared to death.
Cruelty is reflex of fear.
Lurk in shadows until you're ready.

When finally you're sick of yourself,
look behind to see your damage.
Was is worthy for you?
Or was it just a piece of the past?
