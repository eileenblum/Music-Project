Frightening laughter from nowhere
Eyes surpassing weak flesh
The thousand wounds death will take all
Fear, Anger, Hopelessness

Just try to survive, my son
Life is chaotic, misery's rule
Glide up your life, carve up your name
Forget whoever's on your side

Tear it down, Ram it up
Destroy the walls of the sanatorium
The Green House, the Black Guard
Disorder is everywhere

Save the murderer, escape from mutiny
the frigate's sailing on blood
the thousand wounds death will take them all
One by one we'll fall
