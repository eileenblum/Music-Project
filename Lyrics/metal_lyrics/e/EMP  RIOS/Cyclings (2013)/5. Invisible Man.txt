Time to catch up with your concepts
Maybe set it even again
Let the everyday hang-on-pull-off over
Driven by the eternal, etherial

Chase it, the never standing glimpse of reality.
Broken glasses, empty gaps between your words.

Words thrown in the papers,
will you find yourself?
Lost between the lines
you're an invisible man.

Arguments, alliances,
Don't let the elephants talk.
Sometimes you feel like falling,
I know how clichÃ¨ you try to be.

How can you love it?
This state of pain and grace?
Look behind you, look beside,
You're an invisible man.
