My goal is to loose conscience.
The challenge is to wreck my soul.
I've ran out of alibis,
I've ran out of control.

The silvery moon invites me
to the funeral of my dreams.
My last hope, deep buried.
It's time to justify my means.

Sick and tired I come to rest.
Over fire, my other self staring
All around me, you all try to imprison me.
No force can bring me back to this world.

Phantoms, come to the fire,
let us celebrate the night.
Gentle lions, come to the rain,
let us have one last feast.

Dear serpents, come to me.
Smell the hot blood on my veins.
It'll all be yours, take me
to the loss of everything.

Every me in this fire
Is helping me to get where I want
At stake, my deared sanity
Carved within my very soul.
