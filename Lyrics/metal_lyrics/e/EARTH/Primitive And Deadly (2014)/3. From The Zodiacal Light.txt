There's a darkness - that gently carries me
The sunlight seems to have blinded me
With the consequence of knowing what will be
There's a melody that is destined to save me

The dream passes your window
You're awake now - where did your love go?
This darkness (darkness) - it can't be over yet
You're drowning (drowning) â in all of my regret

It's all over now (over now) - the devils got you down
It's all over now (over now) - there's no need to come down
It's all over now (over now) - the devils got you
It's all over now

I'm sorry, you took me by surprise
You had no idea that I would be your demise
I can tell you â of knowing what we need
To end you - I won't set you free

Oh, somewhere - the wolves they mate and howl
In the darkness of the ever passing hour
Oh, somewhere - in the darkness, reaching out
The cauldron is brewing something foul

There is a darkness - that gently carries me
The sunlight seems to have blinded me
With the consequence of knowing what will be
There's a melody that is destined to save me

The dream passes by your window
You're awake now - where did your love go?
This darkness (darkness) - it can't be over yet
You're drowning (drowning) â in all of my regret

It's all over now - the devils got you down
It's all over now (over now) - there's no need to come down
It's all over now - the devils got you
It's all over now.ï»¿
