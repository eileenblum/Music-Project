[Verse 1]
When we two parted
In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted,
To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
Sorrow to this.

[Chorus]
The dew of the morning
Sank chill on my brow
It felt like the warning
Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,
And light is thy fame
I hear thy name spoken,
And share in its shame.

[Verse 2]
They name thee before me,
A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes over me
Why wert you so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
Who knew thee too well:
Long, long shall I rue thee
Too deeply to tell.

[Chorus]
In secret we met
In silence I grieve
That thy heart could forget,
Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee
After long years,
How should I greet thee?
With silence and tears.

[Interlude 1]

[Interlude 2]

[Chorus]
The dew of the morning
Sank chill on my brow
It felt like the warning
Of what I feel now.
If I should meet thee
After long years,
How should I greet thee?
With silence and tears.
