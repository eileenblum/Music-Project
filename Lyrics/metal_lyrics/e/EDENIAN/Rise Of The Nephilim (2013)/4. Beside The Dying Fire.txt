[Verse 1]
When you lose your will,
does your fire die?
The snow of reality
will surely kill your flame

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me fall into a burning
pit of embers painting night.
Follow ashes dancing slowly
in the winter's dimming light.
As I feel the breath of darkness,
Iâm trying not to remember
how this life's so cold and hollow
like the death call of December

[Verse 2]
Find your shelter
Dark and hollow
Enlighten it with inner fire
Escape the sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling leaves are calling out
to sing up to the waning moon,
Their intentions diabolic:
overshadowing Her groom.
Morning heat will not return to me
from stoic greying skies.
A living fire burns untilâ¦
Until it snows and then it diesâ¦

[Chorus]
As all light will fade
Darkness will come
Bringing the pain to youâ¦
When nothing remains
All hope is gone
Taking away the dewâ¦

[Bridge]
Beside the dying fire
My hope is lost
Inside my putrid soul
No light, but ire

[Chorus]
As all light will fade
Darkness will come
Bringing the pain to youâ¦
When nothing remains
All hope is gone
Taking away the dewâ¦
