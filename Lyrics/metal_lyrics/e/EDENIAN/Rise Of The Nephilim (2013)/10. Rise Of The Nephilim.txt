[Verse 1]
This curse you call life is reaching the end
And we, all his children are falling from grace
For mighty our will to live on this land
The chant of the prophet â the death of our race

[Verse 2]
Forever banished we carry the cross
Of pain and as martyrs tormented by guilt
You have all His love while us being betrayed
And wings that were broken â the price we pay to Earth

[Pre-Chorus]
Blood-red tears dripping from my eyes
Crying, dying, burning my disguise
I will rise up and fly once again
Behold your sons â angels with dirty wings

[Chorus]
Fly, brothers, fly!
Weâll take our place in heaven
Spread your wings and follow me
Through the rain and night
We shall rise as one
United are weâ¦
The sons of the God
Meet your destiny !

[Verse 3]
For true love we seek and find it in you
This alliance unholy until all is lost
We wonder the path of the shattered fate
Illusions of future â so will we rise again?â¦

[Pre-Chorus]
Blood-red tears dripping from my eyes
Crying, dying, burning my disguise
I will rise up and fly once again
Behold your sons â angels with dirty wings

[Chorus]
Fly, brothers, fly!
Weâll take our place in heaven
Spread your wings and follow me
Through the rain and night
We shall rise as one
United are weâ¦
The sons of the God
Itâs our destinyâ¦

[Outro]
Eradicate the fallenâ¦
Abominationâ¦
