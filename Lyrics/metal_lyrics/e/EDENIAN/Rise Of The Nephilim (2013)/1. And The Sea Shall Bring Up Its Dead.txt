[Verse 1 (Growl)]
Thousands of years have gone
Reaching the end of ages
Breed of the mortals is dead
Unwilling to hear the sages
Prophecy thy will be done
Only the pure will stay
Mankind is wasted and gone
They taking existence away

[Pre-Chorus (Growl)]
And the sea shall bring up itâs dead
Fear of him, living eternal dread

[Chorus (Growl/Scream + female enters in part 2)]
Worldâs fading away again
He will be released
Come from the depth of Hades
Bringing death and

Pain - it is the fate for us
As the final quest
Lurking for truth inside
Let us lay to rest

[Verse 2]
For I have seen the end
Fire is coming down
He who deceived them was
Thrown to the lake of sulphur
False prophet and the beast
Feel the torment forever
I saw the dead great and small
Crying in their endevour

[Pre-Chorus (Growl)]
And the sea shall bring up itâs dead
Fear of him, living eternal dread

[Chorus (Growl/Scream + female enters in part 2)]
Worldâs fading away again
He will be released
Come from the depth of Hades
Bringing death and

Pain - it is the fate for us
As the final quest
Lurking for truth inside
Let us lay to rest

[Interlude 1]

[Interlude 2 (Scream)]

I saw a great, great and white throne
And him who was seated on it
The Earth and heavens fled from his presence
And there was no place for themâ¦
The sea gave up dead that were in it
For death and Hades gave up their dead
And everyone is here for judgment
According to what they have doneâ¦

[Verse 3 (Growl)]
Thousands of years have gone
Reaching the end of ages
Breed of the mortals is dead
Unwilling to hear the sages

[Pre-Chorus (Growl)]
And the sea shall bring up itâs dead
Fear of him, living eternal dread

[Chorus (Growl/Scream + female enters in part 2)]
Worldâs fading away again
He will be released
Come from the depth of Hades
Bringing death and
Pain - this is the fate for us
As the final quest
Lurking for truth inside
Let us lay to rest
