[Verse 1]
If I'm gone when you awaken
Please don't think I was unkind
As I left, I thought about you
And still hold you in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know where I am heading
But I know where I have been
It was heaven to have known you
Though some might have called it sin
â¦Call it sin!

[Chorus]
In the garden of grief
Silent flower grows
In the hour of despair
Come and touch a farewell rose

[Verse 2]
When you lay me on the table
'Fore you put me in the ground
Whisper close and say you loved me
So that I may keep the sound

[Pre-Chorus]
As you wander in the graveyard
Past the roses growing on the wall
Pick a bloom and take it with you
For another at the ball
â¦At the ball!

[Chorus]
In the garden of grief
Silent flower grows
In the hour of despair
Come and touch a farewell rose
