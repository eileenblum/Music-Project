[Verse 1]
I walked alone through the Rivendell
For a thousand years or more
But that fair day you came to me
Upon this elven shore.
Your eyes were dreams of far off lands,
Your voice was like a song,
My love for you had an eternal youth,
A love that was not wrong.

[Chorus]
Rising like fire
Burning through the night
I lost you, my Sire
Behold my own light
After forever stars will shine above
But shall you remember my love?

[Bridge]
But one day Lord Elrond spoke,
Of quests to the unknown,
And from that moment I was gone,
Like the North Wind I had flown

[Verse 2]
Many times we wandered through,
The valleys of green and gold,
We looked upon the crystal lakes
That shined from days of old.
You took my hand and all was clear,
I was safe when in your arms,
I fell for your enchanting spell,
Your rugged ranger charms

[Chorus]
Rising like fire
Burning through the night
I lost you, my Sire
Lost my own light
After forever stars will shine above
But still you remember my love.

[Break]
And still I wait under elven skies,
For you to return to me,
If you perish on your road,
My soul to you will fly.

[Bridge]
Oh Arwen, to my heart,
You alone posses the key.
I will love and cherish you this day,
And for all Eternity.
