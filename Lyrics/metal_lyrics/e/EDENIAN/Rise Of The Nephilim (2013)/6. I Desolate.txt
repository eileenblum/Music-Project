[Verse 1]
In hour of my despair
You are the one I curse
Dragging me down, I dissappear
You are the key to my loss
Fortune and sin twisting around
Emptiness calling me in her embrace
I close my eyes but still hear the sound
My world is collapsing before my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Desolate is my heart
Empty is my soul
You tear me apart
Fallingâ¦

[Chorus]
Down to me where no hope lives again
Drown with me to hollow
Eye for an eye, estimate the suffering
I desolate your heart for my sorrow

[Verse 2]
This night that I behold
Keep(s) me away from you
I crucify my memories, left none for me
My heart is coldâ¦
Take back my pain, swallow the rue
This life is meaningless, my tragedyâ¦
Forward I creep, but nothing remains
The hate is eternal, my remedyâ¦

[Pre-Chorus]
Desolate is my heart
Empty is my soul
You tear me apart
Fallingâ¦

[Chorus (Growl)]
Down to me where no hope lives again
Drown with me to hollow
Eye for an eye, estimate the suffering
I desolate your heart for my sorrow

[Interlude]

[Interlude 2 (Scream)]

Light my fire into me
Face the warm and set me free
Be my guide through endless rain
I will take away the pain
Taste the poison in my blood
Sink your soul unto flood
Desolate and infiltrate
Push me forward you, my hate

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus (Female and growl)]
Desolate is my heart
Empty is my soul
You tear me apart
Fallingâ¦

[Chorus (Female and growl)]
Down to me where no hope lives again
Drown with me to hollow
Eye for an eye, estimate the suffering
I desolate your heart for my sorrow
