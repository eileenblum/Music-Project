[Verse 1]
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer, my Love, to thee!
Even tho' it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer to thee!

[Chorus]
Tho' like a wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer to thee.

[Verse 2]
There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven;
All that thou sendest me
In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer to thee.

[Chorus]
Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer to thee.

[Break]
Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly.

[Interlude]

Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer, my Love, to thee,
Nearer to thee!
