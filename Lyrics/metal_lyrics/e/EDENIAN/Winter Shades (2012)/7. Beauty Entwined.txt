I see somehow white is turning grey
Cross the line
Youâve told me now:
âI repay for your cryâ

Dismal thoughts burning in me
Save me now of what to be
For all sins beauty entwined
And my life is but declined

See the fading sun shines for you
Bring my stars to me, I dream too
For all times we share one our breath
When the sunrise comes â there is no death

I see somehow white became so grey
Crossed is line
Sob to me now,
I repay for my cry

Dismal thoughts burning in me
Save me now of what to be
For all sins beauty entwined
And my life is but declined

See the fading sun shines for you
Bring my stars to me, I dream too
For all times we share one our breath
When the sunrise comes â there is no death
