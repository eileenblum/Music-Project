I woke up in the ice-cold room
In darkend silence I behold
This frigid frost reflects my doom
In sleep my soul will be unfold

Feel the silence, time is dust
That you keep in hands
Self-delusion of the dream
Wall of silence stands

Coldness, fear, breathing near
Lost, forever, blazing sheer

Heal my heart, awake me now
Feel my pain streams down inside
Horrid dreams depart somehow
But remains this cold night

Feel the silence, time is dust
That you keep in hands
Self-delusion of the dream
Wall of silence stands

Coldness, fear, breathing near
Lost, forever, blazing sheer

My winter spells to me
With bitter whispering
But silence is all I hear
Embracing soul with hateful fear

Embittered silence fills my mind
With pain
Forever frozen hope I find
My reign

Feel the silence, time is dust
That you keep in hands
Self-delusion of the dream
Wall of silence stands

Coldness, fear, breathing near
Lost, forever, blazing sheer
