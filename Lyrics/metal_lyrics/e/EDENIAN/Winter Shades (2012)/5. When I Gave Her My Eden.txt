Come, follow me, behold my sight
Pure and full of my glory
All that I saw did me delight
Sin with me in my own story

So close my eyes
Youâre real to me as sin Iâve done
My every breath you hold inhaled
No one can grab my memoryâ¦

Behold I rise, and now I know 
I won the prize, your poison shed would be unshown
Chokâd up my path, no hid the face
You bring my Eden now

I was sent from high above
Just for you, in thy own dream
I will surround you by my love
Birds will sing deafen your scream

So close my eyes
Youâre real to me as sin we done
My every breath you hold inhaled
No one can grab my memoryâ¦

Behold I rise, and now I know
I won the prize, your poison shed is now shown
Chokâd up my path, no hid the face
You fail my Eden now

Rise Eden to me so I gave her
My dreams will be untouched they were

Behold I rise, and now I know
I won the prize, your poison shed for me is shown
Chokâd up my path, no hid the face
You see my Eden now
