Same old sorrows blur his eyes
As itâs time for duskfall
Looking back to see his tracks
He stands tall
Why he steps across the land
On these darkened ways?
Cast no shadows on the wall
Of the gloomy days

As I close my eyesâ¦
Kneel down to the groundâ¦
Emptiness fulfilling meâ¦
Dusk is all aroundâ¦
I try to cast this night away...
And feel the warm of the new dayâ¦

Dusk will come and bring him back
All of his despondence
Multiply the memories
He wonât forget
Dark is path and no way home
Time of night will guide him
He must kill the will to die,
His last regret

As I close my eyesâ¦
Kneel down to the groundâ¦
Emptiness fulfilling meâ¦
Dusk is all aroundâ¦
I try to cast this night away...
And feel the warm of the new dayâ¦

Until itâs over 
â¦My eyes
Forever after
â¦My empty space
Until itâs over
â¦My cries
Forever after
â¦In my disgrace

Same old sorrows blur my eyes

Forever after
