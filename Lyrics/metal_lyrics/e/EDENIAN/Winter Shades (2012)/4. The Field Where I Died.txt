I estimate their works and them
So rightly, that at times I almost dream
I too have spent a life the sages' way
And tread once more familiar paths

Perchance I perished in an arrogant self-reliance
Ages ago 
And in that act, a prayer for one more chance 
went up so earnest, soâ¦

Take my hand, follow me
To the place where I lie
You will see, you will hear
The last one manâs cry
In other life 
I was here standing by
As were you wonder why
Come to field where I died

Instinct with better light led in by death,
That life was blotted out-not so completely
But scattered wrecks enough of it remain
Dim memories, the goal in sight again 

All which, indeed is foolish, and only means
 The flesh I wear, the earth I tread are not more clear to me
Than my belief 
Explained to you or no

Grab my hand, follow me
To the place where I lie
You will see, you will hear
The last one manâs cry
In other life 
I was here standing by
As were you wonder why
Come to field where I died

Now follow me
To the place where I lie
You will see, you will hear
The last one manâs cry
In other life 
I was here standing by
Once again we will come
To the field where I died
