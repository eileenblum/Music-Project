Now winter nights enlarge
The number of hours
And clouds their storms discharge
Upon the airy towers

All do no all things well
Some measures comely tread
Some knotted riddles tell
Some poems smoothly read

I see winter shades
Again I wait for you
Fall the snow
And cover me
I feel the winter came
To take my emptiness

This time doth well dispense
With loversâ long discourse
Much speech hath some defense
Though beauty no remorse

All do no all things well
Some measures comely tread
Some knotted riddles tell
Some poems smoothly read

I see winter shades
Again I wait for you
Fall the snow
And cover me
I feel the winter came
To take my emptiness

The summer has itâs joys, they are for us
And winter cold is with delights
Though love and all his pleasures are but toys
They shorten lonely frosty nights

I see winter shades
Again I wait for you
Fall the snow
And cover me
I feel the winter came
To take my emptiness
