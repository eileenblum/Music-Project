See my kingdom of the weeping heart
Take a look beside itâs torn apart
I can feel deep inside your chest
The frozen heart that needs to rest

When thy own heavens wept
Crying for my heart, crying for your soul
When thy own heavens wept
Dropping falling tears, facing all my fears to meâ¦

Weeping from the opened skies
Canât see through cascade of lies

Now I see my heart
Will it be torn apart?
Behold the new moonâs shades
Total decay and fades
Listen to heavenâs weep
Canât anymore I sip
Behind the pale grey skies
Can you believe the lies?

Feel the fire burning up for you
Overcasting skies, will you break through?
Endurance, morning comes so cold
Drowns in the vale of tears in fold

Silent clouds cover us by rain
Just another day will go astray
I behold heavens curtain thee
Embrace your soul with silent weep

When thy own heavens wept
Crying for my heart, crying for your soul
When thy own heavens wept
Dropping falling tears, facing all my fears to meâ¦

Weeping from the opened skies
Canât see through cascade of lies

Now I see my heart
Will it be torn apart?
Behold the new moonâs shades
Total decay and fades
Listen to heavenâs weep
Canât anymore I sip
Behind the pale grey skies
Can you believe the lies?
