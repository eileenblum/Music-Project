They all stopped painting
Don't mind our cry

Should we take it take it
Can we take it take it
Will we take it take it
I cannot
Take it

These streets are paved in grey
Of mediocrity
Colors rot in vain
They all stopped painting

When the nail sticks
Out
Hammer the nail
Down
Don't mind our
Cry
And close the sky

Who can blame us
Who can blame
I do

Who wanna go with us (I do)
Step out of the zone (I do)
I hate being told what to do
What to think
What is right and wrong

Who wanna stomp the mice (I do)
That follow the dice (I do)
Psychopaths control the masses
Slip out
Of the grip of lies

Reign of acid rain
Sowing displeasure
Words of angry men
Choking their own throats

Money spoils the character
I didn't know
It's their fault
Neighbor's grass is greener
He's got lucky
We need to believe, we need to be faithful
The lord's ways are inscrutable

Who can blame
I do

Who wanna go with us (I do)
Step out of the zone (I do)
I hate being told what to do
What to think
What is right and wrong

Who wanna stomp the mice (I do)
That follow the dice (I do)
Psychopaths control the masses
Slip out
Of the grip of lies

Fire
Burn desires
Bring them to

You think
You think you think
Money brings plague
But that's not the deal

You think
You think you think
Happiness happens
But it's not a gift

(Fire)
(Burn desires)

Bring them to fire
To burn desires

Who can blame us

Who wanna go with us (I do)
Step out of the zone (I do)
I hate being told what to do
What to think
What is right and wrong

Who wanna stomp the mice (I do)
That follow the dice (I do)
Psychopaths control the masses
Slip out
Of the grip of lies

Fire
Burn desires
Bring them to fire
To burn desires

Who can blame us
