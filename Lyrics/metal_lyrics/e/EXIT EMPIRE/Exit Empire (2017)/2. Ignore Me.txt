I've never been so alone
Crowd
You've never been so deaf
Loud
Sunlight fallin' on my skin
Night

And now look at you
You, you make me feel bad
You make me feel guilty for not being the same
Not being like you

Dry dust in my eyes
Cry
Your words of warm love
Lie

You, you make me feel bad
You make me feel guilty for not being the same
Not being like you

I refuse to give up
Before I would try
There's only one thing you better do

I'm sick and disgusted
Your presence insults me
There's only one thing you better do

You've taken your whole life
And filled it with fake pride
There's only one thing you better do

Just ignore me

You still think we're so close
Far
You're one in a million
Just like all the others

You, you make me feel bad
You make me feel guilty for not being the same
Not being like you
I refuse to give up
Before I would try
Just like all the others

I'm sick and disgusted
Your presence insults me
There's only one thing you better do

You've taken your whole life
And filled it with fake pride
There's only one thing you better do

You're one in a million
Sick, sick

You make me feel
Sick, sick
Just like all the others

Just ignore me
Just ignore me

I'm sick and disgusted
Your presence insults me
There's only one thing you better do

You've taken your whole life
And filled it with fake pride
There's only one thing

You're one in a million
Sick, sick
Just like all the others
You're one in a million
Sick, sick
Just like, just like.
