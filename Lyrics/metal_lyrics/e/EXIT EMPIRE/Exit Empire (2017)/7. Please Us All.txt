[feat. Seana]Everywhere and every time
In my mind and in your eyes
Disappointment
This is torment

Release me
From every drop of pain I'm causing
I've made my choice
Set me free
I wanna stop my heart from burning
I feel so weak

I'm sick in agony, there is no cure
For voices in me that I have called
And I cannot take this anymore
I'm dying on the floor
How could I ever please us all

Was this all my dream
'Cause through the tears I cannot see
I'm empty in my living
Bring me back
Bring me back the feeling

Please help me to shut the pain
Please tell me how to get away
I can't change it
It's me who's hurting

Everywhere and every time
I feel I failed everyone
I can't help it
I feel empty

Clear my thoughts
Are you sure who disappointed whom?
I've lost my taste
Leave me be
I wanna stop my heart from burning
I feel so weak

Break me
Bring me down
Break me
Build me up

Was this all my dream
'Cause through the tears I cannot see
I'm empty in my living
Bring me back
Bring me back the feeling

I'm sick in agony, there is no cure
For voices in me that I have called
And I cannot take this anymore
I'm dying on the floor
How could I ever please us all

Break me
Bring me down
Break me
Build me up

Was this all my dream
'Cause through the tears I cannot see
I'm empty in my living
Bring me back
Bring me back the feeling

Was this all my dream
'Cause through the tears I cannot see
I'm empty in my living
Bring me back
Bring me back the feeling
