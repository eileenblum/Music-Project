I'm not proud of my past actions
I wasn't always right
(I see through lies)
Couldn't lose dissatisfaction
In comfort of disguise

I will not bury my life
Under what you call right
No longer can I pretend that I'm blind
I see through lies

And I can't stand
To be on my knees
I can't stand the pain, the anger inside of me
Can't stand lying to myself
I want to be me
And nobody else

Always tried to be accepted
Never really fit
Scared to leave and left to be scared
Broken, you said it

I will not bury my life
Under what you call right
No longer can I pretend that I'm blind
I see through lies

And I can't stand
To be on my knees
I can't stand the pain, the anger inside of me
Can't stand lying to myself
I want to be me
And nobody else

Blaming everyone but themselves
Plague stronger than disease
Excuses flying around
Why the fuck I'm here

Why the fuck I'm here (Here)
You make me wanna leave
Why the fuck I'm here (Here)
You make me wanna
Leave

And I can't stand
To be on my knees
I can't stand the pain

And I can't stand
To be on my knees
I can't stand the pain, the anger inside of me
Can't stand lying to myself
I want to be me
And nobody else
