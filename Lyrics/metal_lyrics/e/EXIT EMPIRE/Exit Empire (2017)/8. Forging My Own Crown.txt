I'm selfish
Can you help me
I'm cold
Can you heat me
I'm unstable
Can you hold me
I'm chaos
Can you correct me

I'm drinking
Can you drive me
I'm screaming
Can you calm me
I'm cutting
Can you heal me
I'm careless
Can you control me

I'm naked
Can you dress me
I'm running
Can you stop me
I'm playing
Can you beat me
I'm pain
Can you hit me

Don't know how long I would hold
Don't know how firmly I stand
But I know that no one cares
But you

I'm strong
You can trust me
I live
You can't judge me
I dream
You can't wake me
I'm here
You can face me

It's easier to run
It's easy not to try
But oh
I'm forging my own crown

I failed so many times
So easy to stay down
But oh
I'm forging my own crown

I will take what is mine
I will take what is mine
I will take what is mine
I will
Take

I'm cheating
Can you catch me
I'm lying
Can you hear me
I'm lying
Can you kick me
I'm lost
Can you find me

I'm hungry
Can you feed me
I'm burning
Can you cool me
I'm fucked
Can you fuck me

But I know that no one cares

It's easier to run
It's easy not to try
But oh
I'm forging my own crown

I failed so many times
So easy to stay down
But oh
I'm forging my own crown

No one care 'til everyone does
No one care 'til everyone does
No one care 'til everyone does
No one care 'til everyone does

It's easier to run
It's easy not to try
But oh
I'm forging my own crown

I failed so many times
So easy to stay down
But oh
I'm forging my own crown

I will take what is mine
I will take what is mine

It's easier to run
It's easy not to try
But oh
I'm forging my own crown
