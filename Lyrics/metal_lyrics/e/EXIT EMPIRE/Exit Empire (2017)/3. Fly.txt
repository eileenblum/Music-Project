Another day (this is)
Of being hold in this cage you've created
Another night (empire)
Of cutting back my breath

Nothing in common
Nothing to say
Hours of talking
Were long time ago
Another fight
I only wish you left

And I cannot sleep tonight
Cause you're tearing my wings apart
And you cannot feel my heart
Yet you want me to fly

You think it can't be done
Yet you've seen it happen all around you
Fear of failing
That's what holds you back

My mistakes
They made me grow
Your mistakes
They buried you deep
In the end
That's really all it takes

And I cannot sleep tonight
Cause you're tearing my wings apart
And you cannot feel my heart
Yet you want me to fly

Fly
Now you want me
Now you want me
Now you want me
Now you want me to fly

This is
Empire
Fly
Fly

And I cannot sleep tonight
Once so close, now cold on sight

And I cannot sleep tonight
Cause you're tearing my wings apart
And you cannot feel my heart
Yet you want me to
You want me to fly
Fly
