You taught me to stay in line
Not to stand out
Don't cripple my chance
You suck at this and you know it well
The time is right now and not in the future
You fucking flock of vultures

Play it safe
Don't risk too much
Don't hurt yourself
And have good marks
(you're gonna listen to me)
Don't do drugs
You need plan B
Don't be naive
You're not the one
(stay away from me)

Shut up
You're gonna listen to me
I know you think that I'm nobody

Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up
Stay away from me
I'll cut you off to become somebody

Hey, hey
Why do you look at me like that?
Your eyes your lies your face your spite
Fuck you I could not care less

Fuck

You never believed
You never really helped
All you did was patting my fucking head

You're jerking off your low ego on me
You swallowed your business plan
And it got stuck in your fucking ass

Shut up
You're gonna listen to me
I know you think that I'm nobody

Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up
Stay away from me
I'll cut you off to become somebody

I'm naive? You're naive
You don't get the point
You biased blinded cunt

You don't get to steer my life
Just cause you fucked your own
You can't fake happiness
But at least you tried your best

You've disclaimed your own role models
And it really is not run by the New World Order
Those are just excuses
You're a quitter and that's why you've lost

I cannot take a step back now
I cannot turn back
I cannot look back

I think I'm bleeding
I am scared
I think I'm bleeding
But I'm prepared
