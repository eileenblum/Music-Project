Miser mortal walk with me 
This bitter Sender
Dense dark nefast and coldness...
Between the darkness 
Terror is necessary
And the diabolic manifest
The expression 
Of your fears and weaknesses...

Take a look in to the deep 
Of the darkness...
Drench your soul in seas of salt
Join your Remains to the eternity 
In the name of Satan
And in front of the dimensions veiled by
The ancient dark gods...  

Know the mysteryâs of the dark 
And his imperial power 
Upon the absolutely dominion on magic  
Of the infernal paths conceived by Satanas 
Drink of the diabolic nectar and 
Serve yourself of feast of the flesh the lust
The Torment and death 

Watch the misery of the light 
Sentinels slaves of the limitations 
Captive of fear and the absurd reverence and
Engender in you eternal hate to them.
