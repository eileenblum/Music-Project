Fucking humans of the light 
Sons of deicide
Possessors of nothing 
Slaves of the pain... 
My soul belongs to Satan...

My body is mercenary of his horror
And in his memory
Will penetrate the Terror 
And will make their bodies
Feel the eternal suffering 

Feel the presence of my hate 
Get inside of You
The torment will be all
Be all for you 
And will make their bodies
Feel the eternal suffering

Your frightened mind 
The putrid smell of the macabre in me
And I will pound your bodies
And Iâll take your blood...

Fucking humans of the light
Fucked is your essence
My soul belongs to Satan
Mercenary of Satan.
