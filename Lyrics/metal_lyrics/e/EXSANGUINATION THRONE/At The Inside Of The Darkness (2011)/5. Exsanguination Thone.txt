Â¡Ave Satan!  ! Ave Satan!

Sons of the obscurity come one more time 
In this bitter night 

Bring that mortal with you disposed
Of the soul Drawn out his blood
And drench it

On the altar...
To join you to the diabolic madness

Of the abyss...
Of the terror...
Of the Exsanguination throne...

Your prays can be hear in the darkness
Unleash the essence of your hate
Behind the torment and desconcertation 
Of your victim

Until lay his blood
In the ground
Of the horror...
Of the Exsanguination throne

Open their bodies and depredate
Their organs living curse to the cycle
Of the putrefaction
Of the Exsanguination throne

Tortured creature of the humanity 
Donât leave blood in those bodies
So as you take the essence
Tie their souls to the chains
Of the torment and desconcertation.
