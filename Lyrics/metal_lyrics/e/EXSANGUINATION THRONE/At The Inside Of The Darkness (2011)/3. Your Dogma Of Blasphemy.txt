Your dogma has served
Too much to the fakes of dignity
Your nefast remains
Have marked the unlimited way
Of your selfishness

Behind the untrue omnipotent
That you blasphemy
In the presence of the blind and def
Of the fear to the pain and death

The humankind are corrupting themselves
More and more with the time
So your glory is shit
And your creation a disaster

Less yet that your lighten reign
Hierarchic and ridiculous limited
To the submissionâ¦

Your betray
Violated with Light the darkness
The rapture is the seal in you
That will proclaim your destruction
By the eternal hate of the darkness
The deicide of your kingdom
Will be absolute and eternalâ¦

Your dogma of blasphemyâ¦
