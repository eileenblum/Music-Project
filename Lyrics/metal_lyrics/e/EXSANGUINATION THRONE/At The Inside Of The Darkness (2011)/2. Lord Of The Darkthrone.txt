Lord of the dark throne
You who ruled... 
With Strength about the knowledge 
Of right and wrong
That possesses the mind 
And liberate the flesh

Oh lord of the dark throne!

That possesses the mind
And liberate the flesh

Oh lord of the dark throne!

Proclaim the signs and open the gates of hell
Rise with your dark reign 
Before the side of the world 
Show cruelty and unleash...
Your rage... Die!!!

Cover with your sinister darkness all of the light 
Destroy the rules of the bastard with your fire 
Cut his head and eat over the skull.
