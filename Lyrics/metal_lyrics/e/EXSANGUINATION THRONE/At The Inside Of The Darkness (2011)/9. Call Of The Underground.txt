Bitter like ashes was my beginning 
When the call of the underground

I heard I made it mine 
Inside of me
Join to the glooms
Of your dense obscurity

Full of hate and hungry of vengeance
I ask from you sathanas
That my melancholy 
Be just chaos and destruction

Call...

That the mortal blood 
Which I drink be the symbol
Of my pact with you and the mark of the souls
That I take for you...

Father guide me to you 
Under the red moon and annihilate the pumps
Of my black heart 
I hear your striptocius power
That comes from your abyss

Call of the underground...
Raise my spirit and possess my body 
Take it to you Where the darkness
Is so immense
That nothing more exist

Call...

Bitter like ashes was my beginning 
When the call of the underground


I heard I made it mine 
Inside of me
Join to the glooms
Of your dense obscurity

Call...

Invocation of my sadness and my long loneliness         

Call of the underground!

Darkness of your abyss
Cradle of the abomination  

Call...
