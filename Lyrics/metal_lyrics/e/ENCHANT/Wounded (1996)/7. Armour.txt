Here I stand Beside you ,still I somehow stand apart
I'm burdened in my spirit,a stone is weighing down my heart
I'm riddled in my depths by this half-heartedness
Sundered from the "now" by self-protectiveness
Look around in your heart
Cut off from the moment
Divested all the way
No music in this silence
No colour in this grey
I'm rarely fully there,I cloak myself from harm's way
An inmate of my own device who's blinded by the light of day
Summon forth from your heart
Cut off from the moment
Divested all the way
No music in this silence
No colour in this grey
This chasm I cannot bridge
This hole I cannot fill with sand
Summon forth,from your heart,the whole man
Half-speed,half-there,thus I'm half-alive
Un-veiled and un-guised then I'm genuine
But why do I die just as I come alive?
So used to this armour, and how it fits
Cut off from the moment
Divested all the way
No music in this silence
No colour in this grey
This chasm I cannot bridge
This hole I cannot fill with sand
Summon forth,from your heart,the whole man
