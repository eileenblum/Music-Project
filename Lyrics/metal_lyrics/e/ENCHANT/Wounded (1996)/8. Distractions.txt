Standing alone in a crowded room ,he hears it
A voice so familiar,not unlike his own,he fears it
His name being called out from across the room, but he can't see
He's willingly blindfolded starting towards the voice,but each step leads
Into a dance with a different stranger
His purpose he quickly forgets
Each dance delights till the song is through
But the silence between the songs reminds him what he'd intended to
Do
But the voice-----It knows no time-----Waits patiently
Can't record a wrong,his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever,it'll still be there,waiting jealously
He moves towards the voice,more determined now but still can't see
The music begins and he's pulled away again ,by flattery
Just as with a drug the words purposely inoculate
All puffed up,but silence,,when the music ends,quickly deflates
Now the voice,though never changing, begins to sound to him like a
Shriek
He covers his ears with his hands
Now deaf and blind, he wanders aimlessly
Submerged in the darkness he's forgotten what he was to be
But the voice-----It knows no time-----Waits jealouly
Can't record a wrong,his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever,it'll still be there,waiting patiently
He cannot see the floor is wet, nor does he hear the strangers warn
He slips onto his back and,lying paralyzed,he feels forlorn
The music begins,and strangers whom he trusted leave him there
Helpless and immoblile lying on the floor----and no one cares
But the voice that once was distant sounds as thought it;s right next to
His ear
And no longer the shrieking does he hear
The voice says "WALK" and,suddenly, he knew he would
It says"REMOVE THE BLINDFOLD", suddenly he knew he always
Could
But the voice-----It knows no time-----Waits patiently
Can't record a wrong,his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever,it'll still be there,waiting jealously
But the voice-----It knows no time-----Waits jealously
Can't record a wrong,his past it can't see
And if it takes him forever,it'll still be there,waiting patiently
