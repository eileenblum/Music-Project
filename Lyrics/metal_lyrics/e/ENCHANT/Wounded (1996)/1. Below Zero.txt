You won't hear me laugh,you won't hear me cry
You won't even hear what I'm thinking
I can't even speak ,I'm too weak to try
Surprised I'm even still breathing
Like winter's icy touch ,I'm...
Cold,so cold,from the surface of skin, to the depths of my soul
Cold,so cold,my temperature feels one hundred below
My being is numb,but I strain to fell
A heart that's become black and rotten
You don't care to look,you don't care to see
This man that love has forgotten
Asking for nothing ,yet wanting so much
Longing for one thing, the warmth of a touch
I'm...
Cold,so cold,I shiver and shake chilled,to the bone
Cold,so cold, I've made my bed with a blanket of snow
Cold,so cold,from the surface of skin, to the depths of my soul
Cold,so cold,my temperature feels one hundred below,below zero
I can't seem to move, I can't seem to think
I'm not sure my heart is still beating
As life from me ,flows, my spirit will go
And haunt this world that I'm leaving
Offering nothing yet taking so much
Regretting not sharing the warmth of a touch
If I could just do it all again,I'd change my ways and would not be so
Cold,so cold,I shiver and shake chilled,to the bone
Cold,so cold, I've made my bed with a blanket of snow
Cold,so cold,from the surface of skin, to the depths of my soul
Cold,so cold,my temperature feels one hundred below,below zero
