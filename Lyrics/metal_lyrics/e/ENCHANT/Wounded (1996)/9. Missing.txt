One who's scorched by the fire,I stand alone brazen-faced
Love's become an open fumace,my follies stoked the fireplace
Blind to the peril around me,my resistance wearing thin
I fell prey to the power of temptation,and the brand of infidelity kissed
My skin
With each kiss a heart breaking,with a touch her love dies for me
Slowly desintegrates
Blackned by coals of deception,I cry for redemption far too late
Here today, gone tomorrow
Trail of tears leads to sorrow
Leads to sorrow
Alone I wallow in my suffering
So much regret behind my stare
Is love lost or just misplaced?
Can a heart broken be repaired?
With each thought conscience burning,with a sign her love dies for me
Cannot exonerate
Eyes filled with discontent,I plead for forgiveness far too late
Here today, gone tomorrow
Trail of tears leads to sorrow
No reprieve,despite your wishing
Trust betrayed,now she's missing
Her image you cannot replace
Missing,you hope to reconcile,but you've lost face
With each day soul searching,with the night I cry
"Restore me,reverse this morose state
Never again shall I falter,afford me this one mistake"
Fear today,loathe tomorrow
Trail of Tears leads to sorrow
Dream of when you were kissing
So aware of what you're missing
