I sit in silence here alone
An agony I've made my own
An empty chasm in the dark
Is where I choose to hide my heart
Something that I've lived with ,for so very long
I've never had an interest ,in what's right or wrong
Deviante, or so I'm told
Villanous,or so extolled
A heightned animosity
Distorting everything I see
This world has closed its doors to me
Sat me in the balcony
Now my only recompense:
A gift I've honed to mastery
Tainted eyes that strain to see
I'm not in prision but,I'm never free
A curse that somehow has followed me
I;m not in prision,but I'm never free
Looking out this dirty window
From inside my trophy room
Hostile world I've been bor into:
Hostile world-- I've been consumed
I'm the one you sat behind you
The one you've choosen to neglect
Now I've choosen to confront you
You're the wrong I must correct
Tainted eyes that strain to see
I'm not in prision but,I'm never free
A curse that somehow has followed me
I'm not in prision,but I'm never free
