[Music - P. Craddick, D. Ott / Lyrics - P. Craddick]

I look into a sea of blue in your eyes
and see a full and swollen moon
resplendent in a stormy sky
I look through your gaze; its source is pure and uncorrupted
and see a wilderness of dunes; untouched, uninterrupted

Pessimism protects me;
limp hope won't let me down
...still I lust for the pure
it unties the knots and turns me around
I swear, I won't unravel this time
I won't, I won't unravel this time

I banish "too good to be true" from my mind
I'm steeled in my resolve by this gem I'd never thought I'd find
The echoes of your laughter fall upon me, like the calming rain
They intimate a surreal world, smooth-surfaced and free of stain

Pessimism protects me;
limp hope won't let me down
...still I lust for the pure
it unties the knots and turns me around
I swear, I won't unravel this time

Your gaze's source is uncorrupted...pure
Dunes untouched, uninterrupted...pure
I'm steeled in my resolve by this gem I'd never thought I'd find
Echoes of your laughter falling down on me
like the calming rain...

Pessimism protects me;
limp hope won't let me down
...still I lust for the pure
it unties the knots and turns me around
I swear, I won't unravel this time
I swear, I won't unravel this time
I long for the pure, I lust for the pure
You are pure
I long for the pure, you are pure, you are pure...
