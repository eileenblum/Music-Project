Just another day,I go about my business
I start to shave in my ordinary way
Nothing has changed, yet something is different
Ah yes-- It's my birthday today
My skin feels a little tighter
The razor bites at my face
What are those lines in the mirror?
Can't seem to wipe them away
And my vision is blurry, I don't know what it is
And a blemish is swirling out from under my skin
And there is far too much hair in ths sink today
And what's left on my head has somehow turned to grey
Like a picture in the sun,the colors start to fade
Like broken glass upon the shore, the sharpness wears away
My face bleeding, I drop the razor to the floor
I try to catch it, but my hands do not obey me
What is that pounding,is there someone at the door?
It's just my heart,straining not to fail me
My legs feel so heavy
Each inch seems like a mile
Muscles burn from the effort
As I fall into denial
And my speech is slurred, I don't know what it is
And my arm is bruised from where I've touched my skin
And there is something wrong with my mirror today
It seems my eyes of blue has somehow turned to grey
Just like a chameleon who changes his skin
I went to sleep young and virile,woke up old,tired and thin
Did I sleep through my life and waste away my youth?
Or did time just pass by and I'm denying the truth?
And my vision is blurry, I don't know what it is
And a blemish is swirling out from under my skin
And there is far too much hair in ths sink today
And what's left on my head has somehow turned to grey
And my speech is slurred, I don't know what it is
And my arm is bruised from where I've touched my skin
And there is something wrong with my mirror today
It seems my eyes of blue has somehow turned to grey
