All I see, fruits of my own labor
All in vain, all for nothing real
All I taste, desappoints in flavor
What I know is fighting what I fell
This is no time to be distracted
Time lost can never be replaced
Don't let yourself become attracted
This need has got to be restrained
Where is the treasure? I know there is one
I think I've looked everywhere under the sun
I'll search and I'll fail and be dead when I'm done
But I think I've searched everywhere under the sun
All I've seen seems to lack in color
All I've held crumbles in my hands
Desperately needing something that will fill this hole
Seems like nothing can
It's time you find out what's important
This futile chase has got to end
Don't let your conscience lie there dormant
The truth can break but never bend
Where is the treasure? I know there is one
I think I've looked everywhere under the sun
I'll search and I'll fail and be dead when I'm done
But I think I've searched everywhere under the sun
I've spent my life searching for something to keep me
Constantly content
And now I'm left here with a longing for what I've spent
