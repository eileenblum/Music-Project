Can you look into my eyes before I look away?
Can you catch my gaze?
Can you see what's deep inside a lost and lonely man?
Can you understand that I wear a mask of fear?
I cannot be betrayed,that's why I'm so afraid
To interact with the other side
Instead I act alone, decisions are my own
Look,listen
Me,myself and I - we will be all right
Living all alone in a dark and empty home
Just a loner trying to survive
Needing companionship to keep oneself alive
My body and soul are mine alone to share
Making conversation with someone who isn't there
If I could just
Interact,minds making contact
Interact,when chemicals react
How can you reach this burning man?
You sense his pain and passion, in a silent scream he cries
His tale is told through his eyes
You cannot look to long before you hear his song
Look,listen
Me,myself and I - we are doing fine
Kid myself I must,there's no one else I trust
How can I tell my secrets, when we already know?
How can I show my fears,when I've already shone myself
To myself,for myself,all by myself
Interact,minds making contact
Interact,when chemicals react
Interact,there's no turning back
If I could just interact
