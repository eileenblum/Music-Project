There's a new moon out tonight
Another reason for living
This time I better get it right
I've seen life be less forgiving
Broken by life's deceptions
Mended by one who saw through
Fall to the ground before you
My judgement came too late
I don't deserve forgiveness
My sins are far too great
To the one who's lost it all
The hand can seem so deceiving
But pride comes before the fall
It's time I started believing
Betting my life on a lie
Losing my soul in a blink of an eye
Fall to the ground before you
My judgement came too late
I don't deserve forgiveness
My sins are far too great
