This is the ending of an age,the closing of a chapter that
Was just beginning...
Battered senseless, this is not what you deserve
Stripped and left defenseless, this is not what you deserve
Stabbed and left to die,all alone forsaken
Life palns gone awry, precious life blood taken
And your dignity is gone
You thought you had found something that was stable
Now you're finding you were wrong
And the promise made nothing but a fable
Blindsided, this is not what you deserve
Purposely misguided, this is not what you deserve
No foresight for this, words that kept you blind
Betrayed with a kiss, life plans undermined
And you'll never love again
You thought you had found something that was stable
Hearts can change just like the wind
So it's best to keep them safe beneath the table
Actions telling lies
Ring, an empty token
Formal-wear disguise
Vows recklessly broken
