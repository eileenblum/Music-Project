No quarter shall be called
Loud his cries echo by,like a river's endless flow
To wear away the stone and carve his life like a knife
The scars he'll never show...
Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts lacking the will
I'm unstoppable,untouchable
The battle's just begun
He's standing ground tall and proud
Despite the wind that blows
As most his comrades fall,like toppled trees in the breeze
Where roots,none deep,had grown...
Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts lacking the will
I'm unstoppable,untouchable
In your dance of indecision
I never realized just how frail you'd be
Cracks have shown in your foundation
Castles made of sand crumble eventually
Soon the smoke will clear
Then we'll see,you and me,just who's king of the hill
Though oceans swell with rage,the earth quakes,the bow
May break
Know I'll be standing still...
Broken dreams shatter the still
I'm invincible, unbeatable
Splintered hearts lacking the will
I'm unstoppable,untouchable
