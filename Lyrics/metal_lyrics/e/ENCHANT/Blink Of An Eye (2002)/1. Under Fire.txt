I'm under fire blood red sky 
Underneath the war machine
Fight for what's right don't ask why 
Just make the sacrifice
Desensitized but my eyes
Still recognize the pain
Truth stark and real fight or die
Retreat has no place in this game
In the dark and under fire
Believing our cause was justified
Caught in the crosshairs condition dire
Trying a case of do or die
In the blink of an eye 
I took someone's life
It's no wonder why
I'm hunted by it still
Bright Flickering light snubbed by my numbing hands 
Don't understand
One finger slip and it's over for him
All's fair in war so they say
But later as I try to sleep 
I just can't help but replay
When I sat in as deity
Was this man a loving father?
Was this man a loving son?
Though it was one of us or the other 
I don't feel like a lucky one
In the blink of an eye 
I took someone's life
It's no wonder why
I'm hunted every night
I still hear his cries
And think about his wife and his kids 
And all that he could have been
If only we'd have been friends
In a blink of an eye:
