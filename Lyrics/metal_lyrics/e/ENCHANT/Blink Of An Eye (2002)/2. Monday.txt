I'm not alone
There are millions who are just like me
Is our life our own 
Or are we breed to think everything's fine?
Just another ant in the line
I don't want to be 
One more calf who's suckling the cash cow
Dressed like a corporate freak 
Begging the clock to give me the chance to be me
A few moments just to be free
Swallow the lie just to get by but I'm sick of this bag of feed
Try to hide but it feels like you're caught in a landslide 
When dreams die you can chalk it all up to the Monday 
Blame it all on Monday
Friday feels all right: you think you got all night
Saturday is great but then it gets to late 
When Sunday comes around 
It brings you right back down dreading Monday
And all of what used to define you 
Serves only just to remind you 
Of the man you'd hoped to be
I can't believe I'm on the clock and wearing a monkey suit
Where is my dream? You know the one where I'm up on a stage
I guess I'm missing that page 
Take a quick look, glance through the book before I'm put back in my cage 
Shed your skin the transformation begins
Chalk outline and the finger points to a Monday 
The only suspect is Monday
And all of what used to defined you 
Serves only just to remind you 
Of the man you'll never be 
I'm not alone mindless masses trapped just like me
Busy little drones day in day out we're all pawns for the queen 
I guess it's how it will be
Chained to my desk just like the rest who have surrendered their dreams
