I'll lead the way, let's follow the sun
Be on our way envied by everyone
Our bags are all packed a breeze starts to blow
The winds at our back, are you ready to go?
I'll lead the way, let's follow the sun
Oh the last time we traveled we labored so hard
But drifted so far from home
Yeah the search is our battle, can we ever find what we want
Let's take a chance and follow the sun
Dare to dance the music has just begun 
Step after step, cleansing our souls
Cathartic release, making us whole
Let's take a chance and follow the sun
Oh the last time we traveled we labored so hard
But drifted so far from home
Yeah the search is our battle though we stumble and fall
It's only a bump in the road
Oh the more time unravels, the older we are but 
The less we seem to know our resolve is rattled
You would think we'd know better by now
