Did everybody spit upon you
God dealt a card you didn't ask for
Are you the one they throw the change to
While the other hand locks the door 
What are you in for
What if I could rise and take this mat with me
And what if I had eyes that couldn't help but see 
And what if I could fly, why not it's never going to be
So tell what are you accused of
That you should be incarcerated 
Can you endure a life with no love
Or is this a life at all
What are you in for
What if I could rise and take this mat with me
And what if I had eyes that couldn't help but see 
And what if I could fly, why not it's never going to be
He put berries on a vine, stirred waves into the sea
He put planets in a line, but he didn't finish me
He made day time and the night, so you'd appreciate the sun
Am I the darkness to your light, so that you'll be glad you're one
Of the lucky ones with all your sanity to spare
So keep pretending not to see me, I'll keep pretending not to care
What if I could rise and take this mat with me
And what if I had eyes that couldn't help but see 
And what if I could fly, why not it's never going to be
