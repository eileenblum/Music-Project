I was set loose as a child
To find my way out in the wild
Feel asleep inside a cage
And woke up in the middle age
I felt like I was living a lie
And had to escape it all
With mortal fears I shaved off the years
And went from a walk to a crawl 
I know I'm reaping what I sown 
But I never thought I'd die alone
I guess I signed up for this fate
By sowing the seeds of hate
And when I finally shook the phase
I was lost and miles away
Got to hard to turn around
I'd left no bread crumbs on the ground 
I felt like I should have apologized 
But that was so overdue
And by your eyes, knew I was despised 
I guess I was afraid of you
I know I'm reaping what I've sown
But I never thought I'd die alone
I guess I signed up for this fate
By sowing the seeds of hate
So please believe this will that you read 
That I thought of you everyday
I grant to you my hollow legacy
Please don't live your life this way
I know I'm reaping what I've sown
But I never thought I'd die alone
I guess I signed up for this fate
By sowing the seeds of hate
