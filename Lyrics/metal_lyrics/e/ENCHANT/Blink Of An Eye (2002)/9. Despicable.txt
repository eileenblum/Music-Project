I drank in my youth and had more than my share
I'd ask for forgiveness but I really don't care
Don't ask you to see me but for what I am
Was a dad for a while now jus t a lonely old man
I've wandered, I've tasted
I've squandered all that should be mine
What bounty I've wasted
I swapped my story for a line
I never let you lie 
Except when you called me daddy
And if I seem insincere
Well good then you finally get me
I've wandered, I've tasted
I've squandered all that should be mine
What bounty I've wasted
I swapped my story for a line
It's hard to stay, it's hard to fight 
But it was easy to go
And I could care but what the hell 
I had my own seeds to sow
And they were young they'll let it go
They'll learn to swallow the pain
I shouldn't have to be involved 
I shouldn't have to explain
Well you were wrong, I can't forget
I never could understand
And now with children of my own
It's as clear as my hand 
You're a despicable man a despicable man
You've wandered, you've tasted
You've squandered all that should be mine
What bounty you've wasted
you swapped my story for a line
I hope you enjoyed the line
