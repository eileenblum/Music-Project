Running out of time
But I still don't try
I can hardly breathe when you don't come around
Thought I'd write it down
Did then threw it out
Reality is the pill and you help me choke it down
Stay my cure for vanity
Stay my source of laughter 
My broken record remedy
Stay my everafter
I don't say enough
And I never lose my bluff
But you, you can shell an oyster with nothing but a stare
Stay my cure for vanity
Stay my source of laughter 
My broken record remedy
Stay my everafter
