I run my desperate trembling hands
Along the floor were you once walked
Fighting tears that come from loss
I brave the rooms where we once talked
You took a part of me I never can reclaim
Your spirit's in my heart
But you know it's not the same
Straining to beat this blur of tears
Swollen eyes beg for my dead friend
Reminiscing with a photograph
Drives home (that) what was won't be again
I will to guarantee my reason will prevail
Pain breeds the need for make believe
To soothe a heart that's fail
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
I drop down to my knees and plead with the sky
Of course it does no good
But i'll give anything a try
Gazing,thinking,standing on a cliff
That guards the blue-green of the sea
I accept the blueprint of the world,that
All must pass away that's come to be
You meant so much to me
That's why there's all this pain
So much improved from our exchange
It will never be same
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
As surely as day turns into night
Like a wind-up clock left in the rain
Like a candle burns away its light
We all suffer at death's door
We all suffer loss...
As surely day changes into night
