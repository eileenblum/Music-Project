Take a look outside your window
And tell me what you see
Does everything look fine to you?
It seems the air is a litle hazy
And the grass is much too green
What's this world coming to?
I see you haven't noticed
What's happening around you
Tell me who is fooling who?
If you choose not to take notice
And you look the other way
The path's not yours to choose
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
How is the view looking through closed eyes
It must seem very dim
Living life in such fear
Like a blind man in the darkness
Clutches to familiar things
Until he's sure the path is clear
See the walls you've built around you
It's a fortress that you've made
Such a lonely solitude
But your fortress is a prision
And you locked yourself away
Sheltered from the truth
Open eyes
If you opened up your eyes
Open eyes
You would see through the disguise
Open eyes
Accept the truth refute the lies
Open eyes
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
So think about who's thinking for you
Do you have a life to waste
Seeing what they want you to see?
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
Having the choice means everything
See the walls you've built around you
Too much trouble to escape
Well I guess that you're doomed
To live a life of indecision
You're buried alive,too late
Shall I seal up your tomb?
Open eyes tell no lies
The blind can see through open eyes
