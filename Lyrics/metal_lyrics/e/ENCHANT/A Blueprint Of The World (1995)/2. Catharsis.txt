I've been a hungry and holy man
Trapped between what i am
And want to be
I disowned my mind
And denied my heart
Inspiration set me free
Reklinde the fire
Of what'll be
I see the fixed mark in the mirror
The North Star,no need to fear
Stop, I'm not time's fool
Just a nomad
Searching for life
Should I kill what gives me life
No, I've got to feel this
I've got to win this fight
She sanctions my right
I'm down on my knees
She refuted the meek
She offers the world
The world I seek
I see the fixed mark in the mirror
The North Star,no need to fear
Stop, I'm not time's fool
Just a nomad
Searching for life
You know the heart fuels the mind
Alleviates the grind
Gives reason to strive
Drawing strenght from the sky
Knowing nothing is wrong
How sublime a thing it is
To suffer and be strong
