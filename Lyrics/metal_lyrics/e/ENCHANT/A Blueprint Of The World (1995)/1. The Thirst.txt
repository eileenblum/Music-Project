There's a man who is lonely
This could change if he'd only
Take a chance and risk stepping outside himself
There's a girl he's been seeing
From afar he's been dreaming
he could have her if he were someone else
So he silently awaits
A major change in fate
A change that comes too late
And you're reaching for a star
But can you reach that far
Standing where you are?
The wanting was too much
You're longing for her touch
It's not within your clutch
There's a man who's been thinking
To himself he's been dreaming
How to build a skyscraper to the stars
Now he starts to go to it
He's so sure he cand do it
Though he's lacking the knowledge of design
Now his dream comes crashing around him
And tumbles to the sea
Along with all he wanted to be
A realization strikes him
A harsh reality
He doesn't know everything
When the student tries to teach
The knowledge that you seek
Lies just outside your reach
There's a thirst you have to learn
A hunger inside burns
Time for the page to turn
It's the wanting,It's the hoping,It's the longing
There's a flame within your soul
To strive to reach your goal
But dreaming takes its toll
It's nature's own device
To grab and roll the dice
But each toss has its price
Emotions starts to flow
Your heart takes control
And steers you down the road
Your destination is no concern
The impulsive never learn
Just another bridge to burn
It's the wanting,It's the hoping,It's the longing...
