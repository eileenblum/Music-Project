I arise from sleeplesness invited by the wind
It lifts me up from loneliness and greets
Me as a friend
It beckons me to walk alone beneath the
Nighttime sky
An altar of frozen light to worship with my
Eyes
As you're lost within the view
Something reaches out and finds you
As you leave the sight behind
The feeling that remains, reminds you
With the wind in my hair,and heart in
Hand
Nature and I become one,she
Understands and speaks to me
Call to mind these images that surface
From the deep
Ghosts of sights that i have seen when
Sight was lost in sleep
I've looked across both time and space
And haven't blinked an eye
Fused with the things I've seen beneath
The nighttime sky
As you're lost within the view
Something reaches out and finds you
As you leave the sight behind
The feeling that remains, reminds you
As you're lost within the view
Something reaches out to form you
And when you leave the flames behind
The embers that remain will warm you
