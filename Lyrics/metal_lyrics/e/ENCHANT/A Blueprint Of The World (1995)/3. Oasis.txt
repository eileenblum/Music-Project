My destination is unknown
And i've lost my way
But I still have water
With my rations running low
I am so fatigued
Can I go much further?
Lost and all alone
In the blazing heat
And it just gets hotter
Sweat drips down my skin
And string my eyes
As I look toward the distance
Blistered hands block the sun
That blinds my sight
And dances on the horizon
Is there something up ahead?
Or just a mirage
Fooling me again
Another dried up waterhole
Lacking nourishment
Quench my thirst and feed my mind
The place that I seek is so far away
And I don't know which way to go
The vision I see is a holy place
That is tranquil to the soul
Just a nomad sailling across this earthly sea
Searching on and on for sanctuary
Weary from the chase of life's eluding dream
Strive to reach that goal but it's never ending
Raise my canteen to parched lips
Taste the water so sweet
Take one last swallow
So many miles I have come
So many more to go
Down the path I follow
Funny how we lose our way
Through this desolate land
Lives are grains of sand
Which way will the wind blow?
Sifting through our hands
To fall wherever they may
The place that I seek is so far away
And I don't know which way to go
The vision I see is a holy place
That is tranquil to the soul
