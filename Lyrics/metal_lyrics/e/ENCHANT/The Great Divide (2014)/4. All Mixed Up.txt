All mixed up
On my mind I can't depend
All mixed up
Nothing left to pretend

Change my mind and back again
In through the out door again
Nothing firm in my foundation
Rock and something hard again

And I've got nothing good to give
And what I give no one should take
I'm breaking things that I should bend
And bending things I should break

All mixed up
On my mind I can't depend
All mixed up
Nothing left to pretend

Change of heart and back again
Can't reflect on my own reflection
Thoughts that shift just like the wind
That never blows in one direction

And I've got nothing good to give
Just pick a path for goodness sake
I'm breaking things that I should bend
And bending things I should break

And I've got nothing left to give
There's not much more that I can take
I'm breaking things that I should bend
And bending things I should break

[3x]
All mixed up
On my mind I can't depend
All mixed up
Nothing left to pretend
