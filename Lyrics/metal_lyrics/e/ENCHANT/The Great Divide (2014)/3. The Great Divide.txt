Twisting and turning, always yearning for something that is better than this 
State of grace has left this place and I'm longing for the feeling of bliss 

Can a man know love, or is it just a fairy tale,
like those in books told to a child? 
Can his heart be filled with something more than broken dreams and tragedy?  
Bridge the great divide 

So this is what's called life? 
You scratch and scrape and barely escape all of the struggles and strife
And yet we all still dream of greater things
You have to lose to win 
Round and round until we fall down then do it all over again 
Gluttons for punishment, is this time well spent?

The great divide 

Clawing and biting, all this fighting amounting to a big waste of time 
Scaling the mountain to drink from the fountain is nothing more than an endless climb 

Can a man know peace, or is it just a pipe dream?
Yell and scream and bleed just to know you're alive 
Can his life be filled with something more than uncertainty and anxiety?
Bridge the great divide
Travel to the other side and not be terrified of what he might find 
Somehow be purified and not be mystified by what he may find

So this is how it ends? 
The travesty of serenity is it's over before it begins 
And still we just get by with our hopes held high 
And with this final test 
The good and the bad, the happy, the sad get put to an endless rest 
Can you close your eyes knowing you did your best? 

Can a man know God, or is he just a fantasy
for you and me, one great big lie? 
Can his mind be filled with something more than evidence and common sense? 
Bridge the great divide
Travel to the other side and be sanctified by what he may find

The great divide 
The great divide
