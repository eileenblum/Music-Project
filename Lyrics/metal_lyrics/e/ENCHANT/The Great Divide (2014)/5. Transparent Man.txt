Woke up to a grey sky morning
Another day the rain is pouring
Take two pills and call it boring without you 
Since you left it's all too roomy
The forecast calls for dark and gloomy 
I called your name you looked right through me, didn't you? 

You run when I crawl, don't see me at all 
I bleed to just need you to catch me when I fail 

Here I am, but I'm still miles away from you 
Transparent man, only you can look right through 

I retrace all the steps I've taken 
Your love for me completely shaken 
Apparently I was mistaken 
Is that true?
I thought that we could last forever 
A bond so tight nothing could sever
But this storm we cannot weather 
Send rescue 

I'm brought to the brink, this ship's about to sink 
My bailing is failing and it's more than I can drink 

Here I am, but I'm still miles away from you 
Transparent man, only you can look right through 
You control me...

And I wonder if anyone even sees me at all
Or was it all a dream? Was it love we were making? 
My will is breaking 
I give, you're taking
Was I mistaken? 

Here I am, but I'm still miles away from you 
Transparent man, only you can look right through 
Here I am, but I'm still miles away from you 
Transparent man, only you can look right through 
You control me... 
Control me...
