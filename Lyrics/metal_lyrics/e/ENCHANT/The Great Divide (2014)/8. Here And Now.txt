Where did all the time go? Only seems like yesterday 
We'd sit and talk for hours, we'd watch our children play  
Now we're just left with haunted memories 
Flashes of faces, moments that used to be 

What are you going to say when Father Time has his way? 
At the end of the day will you shed a tear? 
Oh where did the time go?
Each passing day melts away and it's too late once they disappear 

Where have the days gone? They must have came and went 
I should've paid attention, I should have saved instead of spent 
Now I'm just left with what is and what should be 
A pain in my chest, a hole where my heart should be 

What are you going to say when Father Time has his way? 
At the end of the day will you shed a tear? 
Oh where did the time go? 
Each passing day melts away and it's too late once they disappear

You have to say you're gonna fight it 
You have to live with no regrets 
You have to savor every moment 
Appreciate the time you get 
You have to soak up all the memories 
You have to make the seconds last 
You've got to live in the here and now
Our time ticks by so fast 

Here and now 
Here and now 
Here and now 
Here and now 

What are you going to say when Father Time has his way? 
At the end of the day will you shed a tear? 
Oh where did the time go? 
Each passing day melts away and it's too late once they disappear 

I forgot to say I love you 
I forgot to say I care 
I thought we had tomorrow
But life can be unfair 
Our time is oh so fleeting 
Our time is just so brief 
How I long for yesterday
Instead of all this grief 
Here and now
