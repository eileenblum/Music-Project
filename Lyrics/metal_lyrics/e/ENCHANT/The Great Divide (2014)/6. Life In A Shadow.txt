I can't recall your voice, I can't recall a word
Was not given the choice to have my life altered
I never saw you go, I never saw the signs
Now God he only knows, just why you faltered

What held you at bay? What got in the way?
Are you looking back on everything now?
What you didn't say? What cruel twist of fate?
That you turned your back on everything?

I've labored most of my life in the shadow of the memory of your love
Now I just have to find my way out of the shadow of your memory

Life cast you in the role you never cared to play
And you've been typecast ever since in repeating daydreams
But your understudy stole the lines you were meant to say
And I recite them all the time, from the script you threw away

And now that you're dead, you're back in my head
Are you looking back on everything now?
What else would you do? It should have been you
But you turned your back on everything

I've labored most of my life in the shadow of the memory of your love
Now I just have to find my way out of the shadow of your memory

Somebody cracked open the door
and you just walked right through it
Now you're gone and never said goodbye
So I'll have to do it

What held you at bay? What got in the way?
Are you looking back on everything now?
What else would you do? It should have been you
Are you looking back on anything?

[2x]
I've labored most of my life in the shadow of the memory of your love
Now I just have to find my way out of the shadow of your memory

Can't find my way out
I can't find my way out
Can't find my way out
I can't find my way out
