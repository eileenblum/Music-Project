Round and round and round we go
And where we stop, nobody knows 
The ocean of life, it ebbs and flows
And so the story goes... 

I need a new direction
I need a fast way out of here
I need a course correction

Circles...they lead me nowhere
Circles...I'm going nowhere 

Back and forth and back again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win 
Where you go and where you've been
All ends where you begin... 

I need a new intention
I need to find a higher gear 
I need an intervention 

Circles...they lead me nowhere
Circles...I'm going nowhere 

Like a dog chasing his tail 
Like a snake eating itself 
Like a rat stuck in a cage 
Like a blind man reading a page
Like a tree trying to leave 
Like a dead man straining to breathe 
Like a mute man having no say
The sun always sets at the end of the day

A spherical object, a perfect shape
An infinite prison no one escapes 
A change of direction can't change your fate
The sum you can't equate 

I need a new invention 
I need someone else to steer 
I need some comprehension 

Circles...they lead me nowhere
Circles...I'm going nowhere
Circles...they lead me nowhere
Circles...I'm going nowhere
