No one to the left of me, no one to the right 
Meeting with destiny, not a soul in sight 
Coming 'round, not far from going down 
Faster than what's good for me, a pounding in my head 
Common sense has mutinied, I'm hanging by a thread 
Back it down, no time to turn around 

Never seen it coming 
How was I to know? 
Death was looming 
Cry out

Can you hear me? 
Can you help me?
Can you heal me? 
Feels like I'm dying...I'm dying

A chain reaction, catapulted through the air 
The main attraction, flesh and bone begin to tear 
Pressure mounts like three tons bearing down
Just shy of darkness, like a candle burning out 
Warmth spreading through me, what's this feeling all about? 
Can't break free of the weight that's pinning me

Nothing could save me
Except the hand of God 
He came and gave me 
Mercy 

Can you hear me? 
Can you help me? 
Can you heal me? 
Feels like I'm dying...I'm dying

My heart starts slowing
Can't seem to catch my breath 
Nothing but the knowing
of being close to death 

Don't take me now, I've got more to give 
I promise to seize the moments and really live 
I want to see my children grow 
I'm so scared and right now I'm all alone 
Give me breath, give me strength to rise 
Give me clarity to see through Your eyes 
To see people beyond their disguise 
Let this cup pass, give me life 

Can you hear me? 
Can you help me? 
Can you heal me? 
Feels like I'm dying...I'm dying
