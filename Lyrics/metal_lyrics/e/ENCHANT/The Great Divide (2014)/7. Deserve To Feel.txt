Was a place to tread, clean the soil off your feet
Needle in the red, and the song set to repeat
To the hills I fled, from the brown into the green 
Had a skin to shed, to get out by any means 

Not a stone left unturned, not a bridge I didn't burn 
Not a choice I had to find my way 

See the parting sky, see the light that stings your eye
See the veil lift, all revealed 
Feel the thunder roll, seems seismic in your soul
What we all deserve to feel 

Had my lot in life, thought "it is just what it is" 
A twist of the knife was as comfortable as this 
This is my own plate, this is what I get to eat 
Cut off at the knees, now I'm back up on my feet

All at once. I don't know how, a ray of sun the fates allowed 
I squint my eyes to bear the light of day 

See the parting sky, see the light that stings your eye
See the veil lift, all revealed 
Feel the thunder roll, seems seismic in your soul
What we all deserve to feel 

Thought it was my fate, thought it was forever 
Thought it was too late, hands were bound 
Guess I should have known never to say never 
A diamond in the rough is what I found 

I'm not a child, I won't behave or fall in line 
I'm not your slave 
I'm no place to tread, I'm no place to wipe your feet 
Call it lesson learned, and I'm not doomed to repeat 

Not a stone left unturned, not a bridge I didn't burn 
No regrets, I finally found my way 

See the parting sky, see the light that stings your eye
See the veil lift, all revealed 
Feel the thunder roll, seems seismic in your soul
What we all deserve to feel
