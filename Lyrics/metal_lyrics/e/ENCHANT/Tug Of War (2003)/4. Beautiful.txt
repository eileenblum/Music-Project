[Music &amp; lyrics: D. Ott]

How did we come to this?
When did we reach that fork in the road
That carried us from our home?

Where did we go wrong?
How could we lose the words to our song
When we were writing it all along?

And how could something beautiful
Turn into something ugly
And change right before our eyes?

And how could something wonderful
Just fade away and slip into
Something that we try to hide from?

What we've become; a mere shadow of the lovers we used to be
Don't you see?

Where do we go from here?
Can we reclaim all that we have lost
And start all over again?

Can we afford the cost?
Should we risk the chance of losing it all
Or walk away now as friends?

And how does something beautiful
Just fade into a memory
Stored there for a rainy day?

And how does something wonderful
Get tossed aside or thrown away
Like something that is broken or frayed?

What a mess we've made
Shards of hearts they splinter beneath our feet
Yet we refuse to retreat

So think about tomorrow
And forgive all the wrongs of today
We should know better than to
Let our pride get in the way

We can make it better
We can save what we have
If we try to rise above our faults

We can make it beautiful
Turn from something ugly
And change right before our eyes

And we could make it wonderful
Just turn our backs on yesterday
And focus on the love that we've made

'Cause we have something beautiful
It's something that's invaluable,
Like waking to a brand new day

What we have is wonderful
It's sublime, it's magical.divine, it's beautiful
