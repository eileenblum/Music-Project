[Music: D. Ott. Lyrics: D. Ott &amp; T. Leonard]

Dark day in paradise
Tantalized by my eyes mislead
This one you've got to see
And her gaze, it is set on me

Not like I would push the brink
But it sure makes me think

Maybe I need a change
Otherwise why would my eyes so stray
A choice is taunting me
And it knocks on my door today

Not like any vows were bent
Just a glance, it's innocent

Long way down
Don't you think you're too close to the edge
Turn around
Some wounds are so deep they'll never mend

Take it from me it's never worth the cost

Been down that road before
And demise is surely where it leads
The grass looks emerald green
But believe me it's just the weeds

Not like I have crossed the line
Owed her a lunch and a valentine

It's propagation man
Don't you know that a guy has needs
What separates us then
&gt;From those things that are scratching fleas?

Am I just a sounding board
Were you hoping for accord?

Long way down
Don't you think you're too close to the edge
Turn around
Some wounds are so deep they'll never mend

Take it from me, it's never worth the cost
I just cringe thinking what I could have lost
It seems you're looking for
Consent to do the same

Where's you're memory
Don't you remember me
The weight of agony that crushed me flat

Are you impervious or just too curious?
Don't you remember what it did to the cat?

Guess what I did today
Now I fear there's no turning back
Next time you need advice
Check the zodiac

Not like I didn't warn
Buckle up, enjoy the storm

Long way down
Don't you think you're too close to the edge
Turn around
Some wounds are so deep they'll never mend

What's it going to be, what's it going to be my friend
