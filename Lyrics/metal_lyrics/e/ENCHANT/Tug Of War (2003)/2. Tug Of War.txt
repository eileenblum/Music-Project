[Music &amp; lyrics: D. Ott]

Hey, what do you want from me?
As far as I can see
There's really nothing you get for free
Hey, are you dense or just unaware
When you know the one that's there
Could care less if you even breathed
There's nothing up my sleeve
Yet I'm the one deceived

Swallow your pride and choke down the pills
Keep it inside and drink to your fill
You push it aside, still waiting
For your ship to finally come ashore
Just one more drop in the downpour to ignore

I know there's a heavy cost
If compromise isn't tossed
Your dreams can be completely lost
Still afraid of change
And I'm the one to blame

Swallow your pride and choke down the pills
Keep it inside and drink to your fill
You push it aside, still waiting
For your ship to finally come ashore
Just one more drop in the downpour to ignore

You sit and sate out the window
Searching for winds of change
Meanwhile.the rest of the herd
Has much greener grass on their range

You hide in a chasm of pride
Too proud to dig yourself out
Heartache to the point where you break
Wake up and scream and shout

Hey, what do you believe?
In dogma and chemistry
Or a psychedelic philosophy?
When damaging your soul
You pay a heavy toll

Swallow your pride and choke down the pills
Keep it inside and drink to your fill
You push it aside, still waiting
For your ship to finally come ashore
Just one more drop in the downpour to ignore

Still you do nothing about it
You're playing tug of war
Still you do nothing about it.
