[Music: D. Ott &amp; E. Platt. Lyrics: T. Leonard]

Hey, neighbor coma and see
Another reason to be me.guess I win
The finest is all I own
Why even my hair's hand sewn.guess I win

You've got a home you prize
Mine is palatial size. guess I win
You drive a new sedan
My driver's name is Sam.guess I win

You know no prize awaits you
You're in a race that no one wins
It's empty what you cling to
It's like you're trying to hold the wind

Check out this mast I got
Now all I need is the yacht.then I'm there
I've got what you yearn for
Now I just need five more.then I'm there

No you can't take it with you
You'll leave nothing in the end
It's empty what you cling to
It's like you're trying to hold the wind

And in the scope of eternity
You're writing checks your soul can't pay
You've hung your hope on futility
And spent your life away

I've got the green to spare
Net worth a millionaire.lucky me
Just got another toy
This one's a horse from Troy.lucky me

You know no prize awaits you
You're in a race that no one wins
It's empty what you cling to
It's like you're trying to hold the wind

No you can't take it with you
You'll leave nothing in the end
It's empty what you cling to
It's like you're trying to hold the wind
