[Music: D. Ott &amp; B. Jenkins. Lyrics: D. Ott]

Forgot my alarm; I overslept again
Had to shave in a hurry, almost cut off my chin
Slipped in the bathtub.I think I broke I my neck
My car's out of gas, I forgot to check
Going nowhere fast
What the heck!

Sometimes it feels like I'm living in a movie
Acting out a story that's not my own
There's drama and action - and random acts of tragedy
I don't want to be in this starring role

I got to work late - my boss chewed me out
Called me "irresponsible"; cleaned out my desk
Stopped by the hospice said bye to a friend
Found out I had cancer, only six months to live
What's the joke?
I give!

Sometimes it feels like I'm living in a movie
Acting out a story that's not my own
There's drama and action - and random acts of tragedy
I don't want to be in this starring role

I can't believe it
Bad things are always happening to me
Serenity; achieve it
Maybe it's not as bad as it seems

Pulled over for speeding, I wasn't in the mood
Got sprayed with mace; had a bad attitude
Talked to my wife, she'd understand
Said she was leaving, found another man
How can this be? I don't understand!

Sometimes it feels like I'm living in a movie
Acting out a story that's not my own
There's drama and action - and random acts of tragedy
I don't want to be in this starring role
