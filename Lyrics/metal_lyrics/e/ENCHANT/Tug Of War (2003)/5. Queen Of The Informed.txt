[Music: D. Ott. Lyrics: T. Leonard]

You love the righteousness you fell
That no soul was lost to make your meal
You challenge everyone's ideals
But you're sure to let your won congeal

Is just say.
No one but my kind
Has an open mind

You're a friend of the just, of course
If their agendas are just like yours
The only cause you don't endorse
Is just say.
No one but my kind
Has an open mind

I question other's sanity
While I'm handcuffed to evergreens
But if your view opposed mine
I'll flip you off and wave a sign

How blessed to be adorned
The queen of the informed

You erupt that free to speak
Interrupt when they don't agree
The only cause that you don't believe
Is just say.
No one but my kind
Has an open mind

Your daddy drowned in tuition fees
Your M.B.A. in T.H.C..
Your favorite text through all of that
Was 'save a tree' on paperback

How blessed to be adorned
The queen of the informed

If parity is what you need
Then maybe it's time you breed
And stop imposing what you believe
On everyone around

You erupt that free to speak
Interrupt when they don't agree
The only cause that you don't believe
Is just say.
No one but my kind
Has an open mind
