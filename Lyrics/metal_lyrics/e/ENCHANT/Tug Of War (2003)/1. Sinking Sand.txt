[Music: D. Ott &amp; E. Platt. Lyrics: T. Leonard]

I guess I knew this day would come
When you would finally drop the bomb
Conclusion long forgone
But that you'd say it with a yawn

Thought you'd stop
Tempting fate
Change your ways
Now it's far too late

I know it's strange
Responding with disdain
But when you're gone
I'll still feel the pain

Constantly you'd roll the dice
To find your place in Neverland
Mirage that easily enticed
You into the sinking sand

It wasn't that it could
You said it so yourself
It was only that it would
You play the hand you're dealt

You say you harbor no regret
That love's a double-edged knife
To feel its sting you're desperate
To fee it deep you'd trade your life

So again you roll the dice
To find your place in Neverland
Mirage that easily enticed
You into the sinking sand

It wasn't that it could
You said it so yourself
It was only that it would
You play the hand you're dealt
