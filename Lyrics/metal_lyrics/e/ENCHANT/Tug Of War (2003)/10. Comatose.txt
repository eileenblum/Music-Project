[Music &amp; lyrics: D. Ott]

A face with no emotion
Lost in the television's glow
He's slipping into darkness
Not far from comatose

With a bottle in his left hand
A cigarette in his right
He's drowning out the echo
Of voices in the night

Through the conversation
The old me drifts away
Hiding from the moment
I long for yesterday

I hear your voice so distant
Calling out my name
If only I could answer
If we were still the same.

Oh, but we've changed

So what am I supposed to do
And what am I to say?
I feel a bit more paralyzed
With every word you say

And what about the change you want
How can I succumb?
When everything you want to do
Leaves me awfully numb
Awfully numb

Stay for a moment
Stay for while
Join in on this masquerade
Filled with regret and denial
We are kindred spirits,
Though parallel lines
Running off in different directions
Never to entwine

No way to rewind
We can't turn back time

So we avoid the subject
Our communication strained
Sheltered in the small talk
We wait for the other to change

But the song remains the same.

So what am I supposed to do
And what am I to say?
I feel a bit more paralyzed
With every word you say
And what about the change you want
How can I succumb
When everything you want to do
Leaves me awfully numb
Awfully numb

A face with no emotion
Lost in the television's glow
He's slipping into darkness
Not far from comatose
