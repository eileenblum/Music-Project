[Music &amp; lyrics: T. Leonard]

Heard enough for today
Guess I'll turn and walk away
A leaf that's turned golden brown
The slightest breeze will bring me down

In safety mode system overload
My soul is moved with just disdain
But it's not my job to bring a change

Is it all by design
Or have we gone astray
Didn't we miss a sign
'Cause this can't be the way

Cynicism's a disease
No one's got it worse than me
Even if I raise my voice
It's just gets lost in all the noise

Are we over the line
Or was it ever there
Maybe I should resign
To convince myself to care

Can you feel
(Or are you paralyzed?)
Can it heal
(Or will it spread to our eyes?)
Are we blind
(Or do we choose each day)
To see no evil
(To look the other way?)

A generation born to bleed
On the jagged edge of apathy
And to stand aside and criticize
Is the extent of my expertise

After all that we've seen
You'd think we'd want turnaround
Instead we take each brush with fate
And use it to paint the town

Can you feel
(Or are you paralyzed?)
Can it heal
(Or will it spread to our eyes?)
Are we blind
(Or do we choose each day)
To see no evil
(To look the other way?)
