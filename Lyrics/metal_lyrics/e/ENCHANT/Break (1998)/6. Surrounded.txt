[Music - D. Ott &amp; M. Geimer / Lyrics - D. Ott]

I feel the walls close around me
Shadows dance before my eyes
I hear the clock tick, it's talking
Telling tales of wasted time

Just need to catch my breath
I've been under too much stress

Trapped -- I've been too long here on the inside
I'm stranded, stuck here on my own
I'm trapped -- A prisoner of my own design
On the brink of sensory overload

When desperation surrounds me naturally I rationalize
But will this calm leave, forsake me with the night apostatize?

Can't help, but hold my breath
Afraid of what comes next:

Trapped -- I've been too long here on the inside
I'm stranded, stuck here on my own
I'm trapped -- A prisoner of my own design
On the brink of sensory overload

Never felt so alone
Anguish hits me like a stone
Who can I blame for engineering my fate
When what I love becomes what I hate?

I'm finally out of breath
Feels like there's nothing left
