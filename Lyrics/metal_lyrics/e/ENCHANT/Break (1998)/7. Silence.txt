[Music &amp; lyrics - D. Ott]

The words you say:they break me
Conversation takes me to a new low
Can't cope - hide me, false hope - remind me

Say no more, for your words:
They cut me like knives
If there's virtue in silence, say no more
For you melt my heart like ice
With your verbal violence

Spiteful words echo inside me
The flame that once burned has turned cold
No doubt - debated, found out - hate it

Say no more, for your words:
They cut me like knives
If there's virtue in silence, say no more
For you melt my heart like ice
With your verbal violence

You speak, your tongue, a blade unsheathed
Each phrase cuts a bit too deep

Say no more, for your words:
They cut me like knives
If there's virtue in silence, say no more
For you melt my heart like ice
With your verbal violence
Say no more, for your words:
They cut me like knives
If there's mercy in silence, say no more
For you melt my heart like ice
