[Music &amp; lyrics - D. Ott]

Can't fight this urge
I'm overwhelmed with anxiety
It's taking over me
Can't calm my nerves
I just can't seem to stop this calamity
Will it be the death of me?

I'm finding out
There is no doubt I need some help
How can I learn to protect me from myself?

This craving is too strong
Restraint is on the shelf
I just can't be alone with myself too long
Can't stop my trembling hands
I've got the shakes again
Convinced myself the needle's
My best friend

Never been so high
I'm sure if I wanted I could touch the sky
I'm already halfway there
But I'm falling down
Seems my time to fly is running out
Does anybody really care?

I've figured it out
There is no doubt I need some help
Can you try to save me from myself?

This craving is too strong
I've lost all self control
I just can't be alone
With myself anymore
I've nothing left to lose
And nothing stops the pain
But the poison
That I pump through my veins

And my tears they leave a stain
And my heart won't beat the strain
Cause the beast I just can't tame

I've figured it out
There is no doubt I need some help
Can I ever really trust myself?

My craving is so strong
My self-esteem is gone
I must stop
Or I won't be around very long
I won't be around:
Very long:
I won't be around:
