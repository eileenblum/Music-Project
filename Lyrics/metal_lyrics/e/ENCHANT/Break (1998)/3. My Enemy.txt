[Music - M. Geimer / Lyrics - T. Leonard]

So safe within this cozy little cell
No risk at all throwing coins into a well
I lust for gold, but shutter at the price
Reward I want, but not the sacrifice

And the target's well with in my sights
But my hands won't release the bow
I've been pulling back on it so long
I've forgotten how to let it go
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone
And I fear I won't succeed so I'm holding on

A life passes by, I watch passively
I'm haunted by time, my enemy
I fear that I'm bound, I fear that I'm free
And haunted by time, my enemy

I'm frozen by the fast approaching night
A dear that stares into oncoming light
It's time for me to come down from the fence
But either side invites a consequence

Waiting for the door to open wide
Waiting for the stones to find their place
The price it never seems to leave my hands
Intentions never help me in the race
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone
And I fear I won't succeed so I'm holding on

A life passes by, I watch passively
I'm haunted by time, my enemy
I fear that I'm bound, I fear that I'm free
And haunted by time, my enemy

So I'm safe within my cozy little shell
No risk at all, just wishing to myself
The price of gold, more than I care to spend
But the cost of life is to chance the consequence

And the target's well with in my sights
But my hands won't release the bow
I've been pulling back on it so long
I've forgotten how to let it go
And I know I have the means
But my will is gone
And I fear I won't succeed so I'm holding on

A life passes by, I watch passively
I'm haunted by time, my enemy
I fear that I'm bound, I fear that I'm free
And haunted by time, my enemy
