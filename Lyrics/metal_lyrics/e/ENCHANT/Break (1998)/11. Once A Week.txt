[Music &amp; lyrics - T. Leonard]

Once a week I spit it out
Monday I receive
Once a week without a doubt
Monday hard to believe

Once a week I give it up
Monday never shows
Once a week I lift it up
Monday down it goes

Struggle between your word my deed
To the latter I always concede
A two legged chair I choose to build
On bread alone I choose to feed

Well then why even with all this bread
Do I buckle from the pain?
It's just sad cause I know what
I need has nothing to do with grain
Still I try, but nothing my hands make
Can ever fill this hole
It's just sad, cause getting what
I need is so rarely my goal

One day I'm stability
The next thing that I know
I'm relearning humility
While chasing every stone and
I start to throw in all directions
Then I see your hand
Scribbling down convictions
Hassles in the sand

Well then why even with all this bread
Do I buckle from the pain?
It's just sad cause I know what
I need has nothing to do with grain
Still I try, but nothing my hands make
Can ever fill this hole
It's just sad, cause getting what
I need is so rarely my goal

Struggle between your word my deed
To the latter I always concede
A two legged chair I choose to build
On bread alone I choose to feed
