[Music &amp; lyrics - D. Ott]

Some say it's better off this way, now it's over
You say the future's looking grey, if it's over:

Yeah, there's sorrow as we break -- but it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take -- so it's over

Stow away memories of yesterday, to think over
Run away, the truth you can't betray, or pushover:

Yeah, there's silence as we break --- cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake --- so it's over

Words:they hurt, fingers point blame
Look to yourself and do the same
Painful thing to admit
This puzzle piece just won't fit

But we tried, and we pushed so hard 'til something had to give
Still we cried, and I screamed so loud I'm sure you had to hear
Now my fingers bleed and I need some relief
Because my back:it breaks
So I let you down before you fall but still my heart:it aches

Judgement day: the good and bad we weigh, and look over
Cast away your negative display, and start over:

Yeah, there's silence as we break --- cause it's over
Yeah, you've made your last mistake --- so it's over
Yeah, there's sorrow as we break -- but it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take -- so it's over
