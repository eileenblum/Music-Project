[Music &amp; lyrics - P. Craddick]

I am weighed down by this pain
I am blackened by this stain
But I can't complain
We have to choose and deal with the rest
I must meet this challenge
I must pass this test

Have to work with what I've got
Have to walk before I run
No point in always looking back
The past can't be undone

And I have this cross to bear
Can't pretend it isn't there

Trust, once broken, so difficult to repair
Trust me, though
To try and make it there
Life is truth and dare
We have to choose and deal with the rest
In this labyrinth of options
This pitfall ridden quest

Have to work with what I've got
Have to walk before I run
No point in always looking back
The past can't be undone

And I have this cross to bear
Can't pretend it isn't there

The nails are driven in
But not all the way
There's no tragic necessity
Tomorrow can be a better day
So here I sit, alone
Peruse my thoughts, survey my heart
And work to reconstruct
This whole that's splintered into parts

Life is a dare
We have to choose and deal with the rest
I must meet this challenge
I must pass this test

Have to work with what I've got
Have to walk before I run
No point in always looking back
The past can't be undone

And I have this cross to bear
Can't pretend it isn't there:
Yet this pain behind your stare
Shows the depth of how much you care
