[Music: D. Ott. Lyrics: P. Craddick]

Beyond the broken waves, she walked the shore
Thoughts diving down the ocean-floor...
'The ocean flows like life: just like life...

Hope is not a thing that she inclines to take into confidence
For another disappointment, there can be no recompense
Like the vastness of the world, bad luck does not make sense
Yet, in this disappointment, the sea can give her sustenance

She cast her worries into the tidal pools
The wishing wells for lovers and fools
'The ocean flows like life: just like life...

Hope is not a thing that she inclines to take into confidence
For another disappointment, there can be no recompense
Like the vastness of the world, bad luck does not make sense
Yet, in this disappointment, the sea can give her sustenance

Paint another picture of the world
Sketch another image of yourself
Re-arrange all the contours and the lines
