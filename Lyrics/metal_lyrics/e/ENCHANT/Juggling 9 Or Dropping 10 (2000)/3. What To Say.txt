[Music: P. Craddick &amp; D. Ott. Lyrics: T. Leonard]

The look in her eyes as if to say she fears nothing
All knowing smile as if nothing has changed
She thinks I'm asleep while at night she goes on trembling
She thinks I don't know how her life's been rearranged

Can't move my arms, can't move my legs
Can barely move my eyes
To take in the last view I'll ever see
It's on the stand beside my bed a picture of my son
It's constantly staring back at me
Want to tell him that I swear that if I can I'll be there
Watching over him and every step he takes
How do I say soon comes the day when I must go away
What would adhear to a seven-year-old ear?
Words that would make it clear

I hope that you don't forget me
Don't let my memory fade
It's my greatest fear

My back is numb, my feet are cold
I fear that it's only a matter of time now
There's just one thing
I've got to muster the strenght to say

Know that my love is forever
Know that and try to remember
Don't let my memory fade...
