[Music: D. Ott. Lyrics: T. Leonard]

Woke up all alone, a bed that's cold and sterile
With nothing of my own
Bombarded and explored by faces unfamiliar
Intrusions uncondoned

Cruel thoughts in breif but lucid moments
I'm losing all i've gathered all my years
I wonder why these strangers look so sullen
I wonder what i've done to cause their tears

Swirling in my head, scenes and reandom memories
Things i might have said
Some of them are clear but none of them involving
Those beside my bed

I thought the golden years were for reflecting
I thought i'd teach my grandson how to cast
I thought i'd be the fireside storyteller
I thought that i would revel in my past

Waking only to see the shell of a man i used to be
Save me i don't want to be a shell of a man

Comfidence autonomy taken for granted till they leave
Serenity i counted on was mine for a moment now it's gone

Today i'm not alone
She sparks a distant memory
Someone i might have known

She fills me in on things we did together
She says she's loved me since that day we met
She says that even if i don't remember
That she will never let herself forget

Waking only to see the shell of a man i used to be
Save me i don't want to be a shell of a man
