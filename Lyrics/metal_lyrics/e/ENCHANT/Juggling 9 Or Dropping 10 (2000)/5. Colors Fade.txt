[Music: P. Craddick &amp; D. Ott. Lyrics: D. Ott]

The gray light of the morning, the blue-green of the sea
A leaf splashed with color, falling from a tree
The sparkle in a diamond, the fire of the sun
They all seemed much brighter, am I the only one
To see them slowly slip away
Something changes a little, day by day

Gazing at a rainbow, a brilliant vast array
Staggered by it's beauty, saddened by it's modest stay
Taken all for granted or innocence betrayed
A lesson in mortality, eventually, every color fades

The blush of a woman, the wamth of a touch
The novelty of love, feelings within my clutch
I try to savor but it doesn't taste the same
Senses numbed and jaded a little day by day

Gazing at a rainbow, a brilliant vast array
Staggered by it's beauty, saddened by it's modest stay
Taken all for granted or innocence betrayed
A lesson in mortality, eventually, every color...

...fades away slowly but surely as if it were the setting sun
A child comes of age, gains life experience
Time gathers innocence and trades it in for wisdom

Like walking through the snow its purity is stained
Like a shooting star across the sky never meant to remain...

Gazing at a rainbow, a brilliant vast array
Staggered by it's beauty, saddened by it's modest stay
Taken all for granted or innocence betrayed
A lesson in mortality, eventually, every color fades
