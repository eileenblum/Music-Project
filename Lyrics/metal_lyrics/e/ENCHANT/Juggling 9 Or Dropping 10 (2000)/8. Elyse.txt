[Music: P. Craddick, D. Ott. Lyrics: T. Leonard]

Oh to see the moon through her eyes and to feel the sun the first time
No preconceptions
She looks at me and smiles as she stands
While clutching my sandpaper hands
No imperfection

She elates and illuminates
Every strangers face
She sets free, moentarily
Everyone she sees

So this is what they've talked about
So bountiful that you never run out
A love unmeasured i feel her pain, i feel her delight
I feel removed from myself in her sight
An infinite treasure

She elates and illuminates
Every strangers face
She sets free, moentarily
Everyone she sees

I count the days till she looks at me
And saysthe words that she' heard so repeatedly
Then again i wish time would slow down
Because i want to savor a while
Her innocent eyes an untainted smile

She elates and illuminates
Every strangers face
She sets free, moentarily
Everyone she sees

Every day a new revelation
