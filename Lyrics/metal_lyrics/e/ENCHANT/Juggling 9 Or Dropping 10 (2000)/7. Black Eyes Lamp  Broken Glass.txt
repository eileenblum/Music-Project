[Music: P. Craddick &amp; D. Ott. Lyrics: D. Ott]

How long can this anger last
Unenlightened with fist tightened
Expolde and i run from the blast
My ears ringing, my face stinging

And you push and pull me, beat me and bruise me
'Till i'm aching
And you take and use me, just abuse me
'Till i'm breaking

Too strong when you come unglued
Owerpowered 'till i'm devoured
No absolution till i'm black and black
But it's too late
Hope you feel great

And you push and pull me, beat me and bruise me
'Till i'm aching
And you take and use me, just abuse me
'Till i'm breaking

Just around the bend we willh have to brake
Careening over the edge, no other road to take

Up against the ropes again, our daily regimen
Cursing then hurting, apologize then console
Of course it's problematic with an aggression addict
Needing me bleeding is taking its toll

And you push and pull me, beat me and bruise me
'Till i'm aching
And you take and use me, just abuse me
'Till i'm breaking

And you push and pull me, beat me and bruise me
'Till i'm aching
And you take and use me, just abuse me
'Till i'm breaking

Hang a picture over the hole in the wall
Try to sweep up this broken glass
Hide my face so i don't need to explain
And hope that these things too shall pass
