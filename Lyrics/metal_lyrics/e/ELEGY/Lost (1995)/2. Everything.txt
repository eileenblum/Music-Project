The moment has come for the undertakers.
Don't look at the faces now,
Chances are renewed by our loss.

Vultures appeared out of vivid friendship.
Gliding the wind, dying to win,
What the other lost must be found.

If only yesterday would shape up to the words.
I'd like to say, then in a way
I'd be beside you...

[Bridge:]
I walk the decisions, got forced into life.
Can't live by a vision when love is a lie.
Rage without reason, a spell on mankind.
With rain comes a season, each drop is a cry.

Why, I don't know why, I'll never know.

[Chorus:]
I should have known better, to let you walk out all alone.
You walked out on everything.
You should have known better, to let me wait here all alone.
You're everything.

Carried by time makes the world look bigger.
I see many faces now,
They may have even seen my unknown.

Licking my wounds makes me so perceptive.
All that I lost, taken by pain,
In the end I gained just the same.

I'd love to put a pistol to the day.
Shoot, and run the other way, then in my way.
I'd be beside you.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

Now in a way I am beside you...
