I walked this road a million times.
Each time a new direction.
Who's the one that's pushed aside?

Who needs you anyway,
It's not like you make things happen.
You decisive sting decides.

You ran my face into a wall of endlessly denial.
Tell me what you're living for.

You'll bleed, not me.
So when your heart is falling don't come knocking on my door.

[Bridge:]
You.Mind is defeat.
You.Mind is defeat.
Well not for me.

[Chorus:]
If the time should come,grow some scene.
Clean up your act.
With the axe about to fall, down on as all.

You spoke of love a million times,
But one thing is better.
Cut me from your line.

Who needs you anyway,
It's not like you make things happen.
I'm not blind.
