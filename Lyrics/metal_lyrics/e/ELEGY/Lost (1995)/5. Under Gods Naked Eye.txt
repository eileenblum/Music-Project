He sees no more reason, to find the inner strength to carry on.
'Cause there's nothing left.

There are no more answers.
No more fire in her heart, it all turned black.
No tears left to cry, the river's run dry.
Under gods naked eye.

A frozen horizon, he needs a shining star to melt it down,
And color his view.

She needs a new vision, 'cause the one she thought was real,
Came tumbling down and shattered the ground of love she had found.
Under gods naked eye.

[Chorus:]
Save me,from the thunder roaming in my brain.
The chilly chimes, the bell of pain keeps calling me
Until you....
Save me, 'cause my whole wide world comes tumbling down,
My feet can't seem to touch the ground.
You're the only one to save me now....

He sees no more reason, to find the inner strength to carry on.
'Cause there's nothing left.

A frozen horizon, she needs a shining star to melt it down
And color the sky,
And answer the whys.
Under Gods Naked Eye.
