Good morning my son, watch the sun topping your dream.
In the future a future to see.

Morning or not, it's always too late.
Why do we live in the past?
A moment is just long enough for the next to erase.

[Bridge:]
A fading dimension, with a link to the soul.
It feels like, no freedom, but life to go.

[Chorus:]
I - Hide the poet in silence.
AM - Where the whisper still screams.
LOST - Like a storm on the ocean.

FIND ME

SON - To my inner emotions.
TO - Kill the time on its way.
ME - Bringing lies to the notion.

[Bridge:]
You're blessed with the power of seeing,
What for others remains.
The violence, the torment, with who to blame?

Take a look at my life,
Encounter the ways protected by time.
It's buying, supplying and taking lives.

Take a look at this face,
The present disgust, tomorrows disgrace.
We're hiding, denying we're stuck to race.
