In your mind I am free, I AM
Using you to tell, I CAN
When you touch yourself

From the spot where new life gets born
Right down to the places you don't want to show
Try and find me baby, I'm all over you

In a way I am just your darkest fantasy
I call tell exactly what you want and need
I can't keep your soul from falling
You can't keep your motor running
But release is on it's way...

Spirits watching every motion, day by day
What will be your faith?

Spirits, born to our devotion
On our way
To what will be our faith

I'm the stain on your wall. I AM
Watching you when you craw. I CAN
Won't you touch yourself?

I'm in your bed when you're not alone
Watch you make the faces when he makes you come
I can tell you baby, who you're thinking of
