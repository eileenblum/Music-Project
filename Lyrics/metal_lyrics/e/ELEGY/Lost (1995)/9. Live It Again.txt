The thoughts you have given, a spiritual song
I enter the day, it's the first of your voyage
Through logic and time
I'm here by your side

My kiss on your forehead
Your skin is so cold, yet you crack a smile
Without moving you reach out and cling to my hand
Are you happy again?

Ooh, we're crossing the rainbow
Skin ti skin we make love in the sand
Ooh, we go through the pages of life
As we live it again

I'm reading my conscience, why always too late
When fortune is lost
Is it part of the lecture, the lessons of life
Will I learn in the end?

I taste your existence, I feel you are near yet I turn my head
And I cry like a baby so helpless and scared, to meet you again
