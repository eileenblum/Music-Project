I watched your face a million times.
It shows the invitation that I can't refuse.
Win or loose.
Head in noose.
Trapped each day.

[Bridge:]
I looked for possibilities to change course of destiny.
Not one thing I tried, fill me up inside.
So now I say..

[Chorus:]
I will always be with you.
Close be hand,day by day.
I'll be always beside you.
Till the morning comes, till the morning comes our way.

I watched you grow from black to white.
Enlightened by your message inside.
Only fools,
Play by rules.
So mow I see,what's to hide.
