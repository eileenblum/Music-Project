All my life, wandering around in a strange kind of motion
Square one, back at the end
So strong, I always though it's a scaled way of living
Out of the blue, there she was
Love on the rescue

I crossed the line, to end my...
False vision, submission to passion crime
I crossed the line, to find my...
My angel, my Eden, my place in time

In my life, the story of love had the worst kind of ending
But now it feels so right (love showed its light)

All my life, wandered around in a strange kind of motion
Square one, there is no end...
Don't let it end
