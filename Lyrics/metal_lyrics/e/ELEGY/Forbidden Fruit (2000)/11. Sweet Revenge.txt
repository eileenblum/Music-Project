[Van der Laars/Bruinenberg/Parry]

Watch out... I feel the strain
Arms in the air, pointing at me
No doubt... am I to blame
I swear it's the truth, my life's not a game

Against the wall...
Waiting for someone to come, and crucify me
I'll take it all...
If humiliation is worse, than all the pain

Sweet revenge is all they seek
Never smile, they never speak
But pretend to be your friend
Then strike you down

Sweet revenge, hatred deep
Say a prayer, then watch you weep
Strong, the mighty, one and all
Each one will fall

Too late, the chase has begun
My every move, they're right behind me
It's never fate, when damage is done
To the bitter sweet end
'Til the battle is won

I'm standing tall...
Freedom and justice have gone, they stripped it from me
I'll take 'em all...
The courage to fight everyone
'Til truth prevails
