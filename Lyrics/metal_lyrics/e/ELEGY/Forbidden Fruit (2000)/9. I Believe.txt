[Rondat/Parry]

Crystal drops of rain
I make a wish and hope... to die

Is such a feeling very strange
I'm living my life
On borrowed time

In this weird existence
I'm not afraid
I'm gettin' ready to stand in line

An' I believe, there's no disgrace
In wanting more, than just this plain old life
An' I believe, beyond this time and space
Well it's crystal clear, what life is all about

As futile as it seems
I'm never losing sight
Of how important life can be

So I embrace the test of time
And gaze up to the stars
Waiting for my turn to come... my other life

I believe, there's no disgrace
In wanting more, than just a plain old life
In wanting more, than just an ordinary life
An' I believe, beyond this time and space
I believe, time and space
Well it's crystal clear, what life is all about
