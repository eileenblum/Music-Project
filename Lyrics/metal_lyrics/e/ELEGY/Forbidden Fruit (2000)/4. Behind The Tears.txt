[Rondat/Parry]

Hiding in fear
Such abnormality
Close your eyes now, say a prayer

Memories, a punishment so real
They played their cold and isolated games

Games, that wicked children played
They made you feel afraid
Paralysed, a child's imagination

Lost
You're caught inside a spell
Subconsciously afraid
The answer lies, behind the tears

Fight
Don't hide away you're strong
Enough to face the truth
Which hides behind, behind the tears

Reality, it comes in shapes and forms
Concentration, chase those fears away

Thought a power, the power to be free
Think positive the pain will disappear
