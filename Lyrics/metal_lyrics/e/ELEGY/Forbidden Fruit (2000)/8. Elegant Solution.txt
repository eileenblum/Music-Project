[Van der Laars/Parry]

Responsibility and blame, tall orders made
Affecting the lives of your friends, for whom you care
Serious doubts within
A nightmarish tale look what you've done

A sacrifice means many things
Determined you won't give in
The answer is loud and clear

Against all the odds you're determined to win
A simple solution exists

Such loyalty and trust you gave
To all your friends
Impossibilities, this task you face
Solutions for everyone
The perfect resolve can it be found

Loyalty and trust, both you gave

Simplicity a saving grace, as clear as day
Don't be cruel to be kind, just change your ways
Searching your soul inside
Your nightmarish tale has finally gone
