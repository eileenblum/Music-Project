[Van der Laars/Parry]

Wait a minute, hold your horses there
What's the rush now, take your time
Easy does it, the hours the seconds they
They last forever, an infinity of time

Each day and forever, endlessly the same
Nothing ever happens worth, mentioning again
Significantly quiet as always

It's all we wanna do, we're killing time
Killing time
There's nothing else we'd rather do
Rather do
Than killing time (Just Killing Time)

Late a minute, an hour a perfect time
It doesn't matter now, take a while
Easy does it, don't have a heart attack
The brain keeps warning us, messages of kind

Patience is virtue, at least that's what they say
What's the point in hurrying, take it day by day
There's time enough to get things done
