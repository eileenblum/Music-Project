[Parry]

On the surface things look different
What's underneath you cannot tell
For years it seems that everything is going well

Behind the laughter hides a mystery
Shrouded in a friendly veil
The moment when you're making progress
All things fail

A challenge to be solved, they can't resist
The chase
Their masquerade
This dangerous path you're on, what if your instinct's wrong
Beware the wrath of a patient man

Danger, danger
Danger Lies
Close beside, close beside you
Danger, danger, close beside
Waiting to take you away

What we perceive as being normal
A twisted mind won't stipulate
To occupy their genius a masquerade

Way down a no-where road you're drifting
Into a no-where place you'll stay
Make a wish pray someone's listening, night and day
