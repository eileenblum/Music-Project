[Parry]

What you see you must not touch, what you see
What you want you cannot have, what you want
As Adam plucked the apple from the tree he never realised
A chemical and biological attraction, came to be

Consummate, your one desire
Physically connect as one
To copulate, will quench the fire
Burning fiercely in the soul and mind

What you want
You know you can't touch
What you see
You know you can't have
What you need
It's just what you feel
What you can't have
You want more and more

Once you've had a taste you're hypnotized
Forbidden fruit resist the call

An appetite, to self-indulge
Keep's growing stronger by the day
Your self-control, you're bound to lose
If you continue in this feverish way

Once you've had a taste you're hypnotized
Forbidden fruit resist the call
Don't be drawn into it's sweet desires
Forbidden fruit can change it's form

Everything is spiritual, everything has a spirit, everything is brought to 
you by the creator
As Adam plucked the apple from the tree he never realised
A chemical and biological attraction, came to be

Why, why did man create all of these things?
