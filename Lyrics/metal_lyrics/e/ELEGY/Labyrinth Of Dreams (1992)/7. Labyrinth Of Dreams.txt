[Henk Van De Laars / Eduard A. Hovinga]

I'm a stranger, even to myself.
Living in this masquerade.
As time passed by, all that remained is pain.
More than i can cope with.

In my dreams I hear you say,
"Please come running to me baby"
If I could turn back time.

It's hard to live another day. Without you.
You seemed so young and touch and so strong.
It's a long and lonely road in the labyrinth of dreams.
Caught in the labyrinth of dreams.

Isolation, now there's no one there,
to wipe away my bitter tears.
It rules my mind, your spirit haunts me time and time again.
More than I can live with.

They say that time will ease the pain, but I'll keep running to you bay.
I I could turn back time.
