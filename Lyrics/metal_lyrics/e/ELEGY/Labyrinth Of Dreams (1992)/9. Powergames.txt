[Henk Van De Laars / Eduard A. Hovinga]

Another vicious plan made my blood run cold,
I am the man with the thousand face.
I raise my head and speak, like echoes I repeat,
the words will fill up all the empty spaces,
In your head there's nothing left.
Hoist the sails 'cause I'll be coming home,
back to my throne.

It's just like bigamy, it's for the world to see
But no one really knows, no one really knows

There is no need for gns,
such battles can't be won.
Hand me your arms and show
that you're behind me.
Cause those who cheat and lie,
will not be crucified,
I will only close the door before their hollow faces,
reflections of pains.
I don't give a damn, I felt the same.
But never again.

The is on, my life's begon,
with no intention to fall.
