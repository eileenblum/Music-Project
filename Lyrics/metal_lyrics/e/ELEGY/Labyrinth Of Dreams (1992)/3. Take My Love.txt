[Henk Van De Laars / Eduard A. Hovinga]

Just had to take a chance,
a shot for new romance.
All burned out to the ground.
An icy madam stare, a hotel room to share.
I guess it's time to make the sound.

The whole wide world walked my way,
all wanting me to play.
But on my one way ride,
there ain't no place to hide,
in case the monster grows too big.

But when the sound of a broken heart,
fades into early morning roar...

HAD ENOUGH, take my love
I don't need it anymore
HAD ENOUGH, take my love tonight

A wolf with angel ayes, she - devil in disguise,
and blew the party off.
No daring love affair or hidden guilt to bear.
I'm selling my place in love.

The whole wide world walked my way,
all wanting me to play.
But on my one way ride,
there ain't no place to hide,
in case the monster grows too big.
