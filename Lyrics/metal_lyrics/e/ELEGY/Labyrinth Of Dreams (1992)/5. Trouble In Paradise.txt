[Henk Van De Laars / Eduard A. Hovinga]

Watch her walk, down the streets of yesterday.
Unborn child kicking its way out.
Why is it your life has been shattered,
and banned from the game.
Someone put her back on line.

Lost in mass confusion.
Can't you see the writings on the wall,
build a bridge to love.

Sometimes you feel just like dying,
but you never give in.
Just hold on, you'll have your time.

Lost in the illusion.
Can't you see the writings on the wall,
build a bridge to love.

There is trouble in paradise,
(more than meets the eye)
I can hear your desperate cries,
See a life end before it's time.
Feed your heart with lies.

TROUBLE PARADISE
TROUBLE PARADISE

Angels of mercy they're coming,
and they'll show you the way.
Close your eyes and you will fly.
