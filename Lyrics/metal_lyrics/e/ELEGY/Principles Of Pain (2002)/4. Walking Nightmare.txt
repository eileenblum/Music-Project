A promise spoken, spoken never kept
Love's not important, to you
How I foolishly believed

At first, you seemed so genuine
That's how it started
'til she strips you, emotionally within

She's just your walking nightmare
Those empty promises she tells
Think hard, before you trust her
An 'break your spirit, mind and soul
Then leave you all alone

Your vision blurred it's hard to see
The anguish she's caused you
Love, that's her game essentially
Seduction is the obstacle she'll place
Laid out before you
Defenceless, she'll have you on your knees

She's just your walking nightmare
Those empty promises she tells
Think hard, before you trust her
An 'break your spirit, mind and soul
Then leave you all alone

All alone, she's leave you all alone

She's just your walking nightmare
Those empty promises she tells
Think hard, before you trust her
An 'break your spirit, mind and soul

She's just your walking nightmare
Those empty promises she tells
Think hard, before you trust her
An 'break your spirit, mind and soul
Then leave you all alone

A promise spoken, spoken never kept
