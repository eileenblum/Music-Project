This cruel game, my whole life you have played
Still tears you shed
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
All these years, our friendship you faked
Freely this way
Now there's no absolution

This pleasure you've freely taken
Unashamedly all forsaken, lies

No code no honour
A deadly disguise full of false intentions
No code no honour
Surrounded by lies see that look in your eyes

For too many years, secrets undisclosed
Sharing with others than me
Was it all for nothing
You're engaged, in a world of intrigue
I sense apprehension
With no real solution

A mystery tour of pleasure
The ending unknown if ever, why!

No code no honour
A deadly disguise full of false intentions
No code no honour
Surrounded by lies see that look in your eyes

No code no honour
Secrecy wrapped in a strange dimension
No code no honour
A bond without trust, is living a lie

An alliance we made, our friendship was real
Commitments to last forever
