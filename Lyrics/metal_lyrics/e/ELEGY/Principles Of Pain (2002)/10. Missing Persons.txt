There's a sleepy hollow tale
'bout the two who perished, gone forever

Their house was a blaze
A crime was committed a fire did rage
Jealousy played it's part
Suspicious lies, pointing fingers

Missing persons
Disappeared together
Missing persons
Are they gone forever

Tales of two young newly weds
Happily they built their house together

Little did they know
A plot was conceived
To get rid of them both
A friend with a jealous heart
The perfect crime, they'd all believe

Missing persons
Disappeared together
Missing persons
Are they gone forever
Missing persons
Not a trace left to be found
Missing persons
Will the guilty ones be exposed
Nobody knows

No... one... knows...no-one knows
No... one... nobody knows
