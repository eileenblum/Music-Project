An' just like she said you would
Suddenly there you stand
Knocking on hell's own door
Innocently, your eyes open wide

Unlike creatures of habit
We can act very strange
While dealing with emotions
And matters close to the heart

To be so arrogant, yet na?ve
Expecting to be welcomed back
Gone are those happy days
A distant past, out of love came deceit

Close to the heart...
Matters close to the heart
Close to the heart...
