Theories are made
There's a reason they should be
Hidden far away, until someone can see
Many teachers said
There's a world inside your head
So step outside yourself, look an' see

Slipping away
Opportunities, connections never made
God given chances, can all disappear

Make it happen
Work it out
Hypothetic alone, won't make it work
Get it right
So make it happen
Make it count
Actions speak bigger that a million words

Ignoring the signs
Is your life filled with empty spaces
Theoretically, assumptions can be made
Don't wait around to see, if only now

No more words anymore
No more words, no more words make it work
No more words

Theoretically, assumptions can be made
But they don't work, anymore!
