To look upon one's self I see
How into this life I came
Knowing nothing so afraid
A child's breath my first I'd take
Oh what a lovely baby
The lord has given you a boy

So into the world I came
A child's step my first I'd take

Go into the world, be anyone you please
Try and find your strength, inside yourself
Can you see the things you see
Can you feel the things you feel
Don't throw away this chance
As short as life to all may seem

Looking down I see myself
Growing older, children, wealth
Generations pass on by
Waiting for my life to die
...like generations all before

Go into the world, be anyone you please
Try and find your strength, inside yourself
Can you see the things you see
Can you feel the things you feel
Don't throw it all away
Have pride in yourself
We came into this world, we all to succeed
Search inside your soul
Feel the air you breathe
Step outside yourself
Beyond what you believe
Try and make some sense
As short as life to all may seem

You gotta believe, it doesn't take much at all
Yes you've gotta believe
It doesn't take much at all
