The inner room
Was where the game was played
At first I never saw her
The light was shining, in my eyes

Like a goddess she walked towards me
My heart's beating fast
I fell for her in a single moment
Who cares, what she's done

Deep inside the inner room
Their your fantasies are made
A pharaoh's tomb, full of beautiful slaves

The inner room, a dangerous place to play
Where false illusions linger
You can look, but you can't have your way

Words of caution I've heard so many's
But my heart was in flames
She's not worth all the endless sorrow
I've got to have her, come what may

She is the one for me
No matter what they all say
Now it doesn't matter
She is the woman for me

I've got to have her, she is the one and only
