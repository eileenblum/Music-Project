Your quest has begun, to find the answers
A modern day tale
A search for peace, friendship and laughter
Everlasting dreams

Will you walk beside us
If we stretch out our hands
We can solve the mysteries
In the land of the brave

Walk...
Walk in the pilgrims parade
The challenge of life you can face
Walk in the pilgrims parade
Here in the land of the brave

Year after year, endless searching
An 'still you don't know
How to solve, all your anguish
Discover your dreams

...Pilgrims parade
