I lie awake in bed
Wondering why, I can't hear a thing
The world outside, seems unusually quiet
I listen, but I can't hear I noise

Oh, it's not possible
A world full of people all content
No rich or poor, just a fairytale
Try to imagine
How wonderful, life could feel

I sense a presence in the air
I can feel it all around
A kind of silence in the wind
A peaceful energy to share
I can almost touch it seems so real
The sound of silence in the wind

I'm not too old, just an ordinary chap
Who wants to make a wish
A special dream come true
Call me na?ve, call it innocence
But I bet that's just the way you're feeling to

The sound of silence in the...
The sound of silence in the wind
