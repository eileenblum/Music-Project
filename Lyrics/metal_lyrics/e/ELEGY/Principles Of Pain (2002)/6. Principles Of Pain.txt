What it really, no-one really knows
They poke inside your head
An 'still they cannot diagnose
Simple memories, can change the way we feel
Without us knowing from, one minute to the next

I feel naked when they probe inside my brain
If a had a choice I'd put, a moratorium on pain
Unpredictable what kind of mood I'm in
I thought I made it clear, from the start
So don't begin

Through this emptiness
There hides the sorrow and blame
Lies are dangerous
Finish what you've started

Where do we go from here
If we bury the past soon the pain will show
Tortured mind, body and soul
These are the principles of pain
We all fear!

With tragedy comes pain, we cannot cheat the truth
Nor come to terms with it
Staring back at you
Darkest secrets all, hidden behind the fear
Time to face the music now
Don't be scared
