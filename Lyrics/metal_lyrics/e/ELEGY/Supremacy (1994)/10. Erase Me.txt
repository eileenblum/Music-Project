Under a moonless sky, I stood, I laughed, I cry 
seasons turned to tears, as I fought the years 

This shattered soul of mine, has got a thousend sides 
Remind me to win when the morning rings 
Don't hope... 

[Chorus] 

Should I take it on my knees? 
In waves it comes... 
It washes over me, it carries me along 
Will it leave me when I'm gone? 
I'm so young, I'm too young...help me... 

Now when I close my eyes, 
I see the eyes of faith 
They burn in my face 
A thousend lies, oh why... 
Leave my soul to bleed 
Won't you erase me? 

Go where the sceptre sways 
It rules it's reign, I pray for the end of time, 
now I've crossed the line, don't hope... 
don't hope... 

[Chorus] 

Now when I close my eyes, I realize the truth 
No more lies, look at the sun for the last time 
my friends 
The final parade 
Won't you erase me...
