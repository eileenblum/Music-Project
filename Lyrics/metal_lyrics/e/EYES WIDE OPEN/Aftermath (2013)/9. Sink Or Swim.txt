How do I hold my head above the waterlinewhen I'm constantly pulled down
After all these years torn away from what is mine
I can't escape this pain inside of me

I can't escape this pain inside of me
The tragedy is me

Crying out my eyes, left to feel this pain
your guilt and blame
Nothing left inside
For what it's worth, I'm erasing you

How do you justify the things that you have done
My scars, they burn
As the ashes settle in, did you think you'd won?
You won't escape this pain inside of you

You can't escape the pain inside yourself
The tragedy is you

Crying out my eyes, left to feel this pain
your guilt and blame
Nothing left inside
For what it's worth, I'm erasing you

If you would burn, I'd pour more fuel on the fire
If you were drowning, I'd push you further down

Crying out my eyes, left to feel this pain
your guilt and blame
Nothing left inside
For what it's worth, I'm erasing you

You will feel my pain, got yourself to blame
Nothing left inside
For what it's worth, I'm erasing you
