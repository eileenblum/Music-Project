Trying to be something I will never be
I just can't see the truth before my eyes

I'm watching, I'm waiting
for some sense to come out of this mess
And I cannot deny this
it is too strong to be repressed

To be repressed

'Cause red is all I see
reminds me of yesterday, you and me
The words we said and all the colors in my head
All I see is red

And still we bleed from the wounds that never heal
You hold the key, escape this world of lies

The sunrays of a new day
will penetrate the endless dark
and the new dawn will save us
Hold back the night and let's embark

Let us embark

'Cause red is all I see
reminds me of yesterday, you and me
The words we said and all the colors in my head
All I see is red

A cage of glass, a prison cell with a front row view of hell
Erase the past, let me out

'Cause red is all I see
reminds me of yesterday, you and me
The words we said and all the colors in my head
All I see is red, red, red
And all the colors in my head
All I see is red
