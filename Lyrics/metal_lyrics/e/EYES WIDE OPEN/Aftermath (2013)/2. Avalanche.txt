This is the first step, I know I'm not alone
but we're in this on our own
The world has ended, their time has come to an end
heed this message that I send

It's time to unite
unify and let the sparks ignite
It's time to fight
and let our fires light up the night

This is my plight
our history we'll rewrite

And as the flames engulfed the sky
we held our ground as we watched it all die
We are all that's left
but of hope we are not bereft
We're an AVALANCHE

It's time for revenge
renew our hopes and ride the wave of change
We're an AVALANCHE
our flame burns stronger every day

This is my plight
Our history we'll rewrite

And as the flames engulfed the sky
we held our ground as we watched it all die
We are all that's left
but of hope we are not bereft
We're an AVALANCHE

Oh, we suffered, we struggled
we survived a thousand times my pain
Your chains, our shame
your game, your reign it won't sustain
It won't sustain
This world is ours to reclaim
No matter the strain
We will reclaim

UH!

And as the flames engulfed the sky
we held our ground as we watched it all die
We are all that's left
but of hope we are not bereft
We're an AVALANCHE
We're an AVALANCHE
We are all that's left
but of hope w e are not bereft

We're an AVALANCHE
We're an AVALANCHE
