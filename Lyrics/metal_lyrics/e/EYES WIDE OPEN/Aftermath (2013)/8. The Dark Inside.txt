Break the chains of yesterday
Embrace a new day and erase the past
I'm all alone in here and it can taste my fear
It thrives on dubiety
I know this life won't last

As I look into the mirror
I'm presented with the reflection of a broken man
Some things just never change
and I can't believe that this is me

Rescue me from myself
cause I don't know how to hide
This sorrow I can't replace
the dark inside

It won't let go
I can feel it breathing down my neck
I'm turning cold
I can't erase the past

As I look into the mirror
I'm presented with the reflection of a broken man
Some things just never change
and I can't believe that this is me

Rescue me from myself
cause I don't know how to hide
This sorrow I can't replace
the dark inside

Me
Rescue me from myself
cause I don't know how to hide
This sorrow I can't replace
the dark inside

The dark, the dark inside
This sorrow I can't replace
the dark inside
