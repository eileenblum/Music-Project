You broke me down and you made me suffer
And after everything that you put me through
I have become
The altruist

Trying to please everything and everyone
Playing a game that nobody's ever won
You think you're in control
well guess again
'Cause this is the day
the good will finally win

I've been beaten down
frowned upon

Repent
'Cause this world has finally got you now
It is over
Repay
for the things that you have put me through
Repent and repay

And you will see all the rights that you made wrong
I'll help you see, get your eyes wide open now
You thought you would be kings
well guess again
'Cause this is the day
the good will finally win

I've been beaten down
frowned upon

Repent
Cause this world has finally got you now
It is over
Repay
for the things that you have put me through
Repent and repay

I let you in
I can't believe what you put me through
You're under my skin
I can't believe what you put me through

Repent
Cause this world has finally got you now
It is over
Repay
for the things that you have put me through
Repent and repay
