Rushing through urban pipelines
silent tongues define the lines
Narcissistic, treacherous, narrowminded hypocrites

Yo u say you fight for us
you say you'd die for us
(But) all you do is lie
Your greed is killing us

We will rise
You will step aside

We're the new world order
Got your back against the wall
you are finally exposed
We're the new world order
And we all know what you've done
this is your last rerun

Take one moment to reflect
over the lives that you have lost
and the things that you neglect

You will see, this was ment to be

We will rise
You will step aside

We're the new world order
Got your back against the wall
you are finally exposed
We're the new world order
And we all know what you've done
this is your last rerun

Your reign has reached its end now
We're taking back what's ours
and we'll rise from these ashes

Your reign has reached its end now
We're taking back what's ours
and we'll rise f rom these ashes

We're taking it back

We're the new world order
Got your back against the wall
you are finally exposed
We're the new world order
And we all know what you've done
this is your last re-run

And we all know what you've done
this is your last rerun
