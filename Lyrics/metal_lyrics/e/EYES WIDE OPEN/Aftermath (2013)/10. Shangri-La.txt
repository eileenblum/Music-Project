A secluded place
of time and space distortion lies within
An ageless haze
eternal life with the promise of days of grace

Avarice and hate
man-made concepts born from guilt and fear
It's never too late
to elate our selves and re-embrace...

Bring us back to the days when we were young
'cause I never meant to bring you down
I want this to be our last charade
the end of all lies, a brand new day

A brand new day
It's the end of all lies, a brand new day

Relieve my pain
ignite this soul and let us burn
Burn

Bring us back to the days when we were young
'cause I never ment to bring you down
I want this to be our last charade
the end of all lies, a brand new day

A brand new day
It's the end of all lies, a brand new day

A brand new day

I am trying to find a better place
for you and me to start anew
A warm embrace, a gentle pace
a dream long lost returning home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
