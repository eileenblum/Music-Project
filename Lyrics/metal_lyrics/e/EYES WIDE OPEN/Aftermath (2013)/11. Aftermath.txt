World, drained of all life, yet tonight
we burn, from our own ashes we rise
We burn
Yes we burn

World, drained of all life, yet tonight
From our own ashes we rise

We are free
forever
We are free
forever
We are free

We are free

World, drained of all life, yet tonight
we burn, from our own ashes we rise
Yes we burn
(Burn)
Yes we burn
