I can't seem to figure it out
How you could make the choise to live your life this way

The lies fed from the television
corrodes your mind and tells you what to think and say

Here
We're the children of a world gone wrong
Fear
Entertainment, or just mind control?

We are led by the liars controling what we are
an d above us there is nothing
Our betrayal left it's scars
No more stars

So clear, their illusion thrives on our fear
never let them take control or we will lose it all

We are led by the liars controling what we are
and above us there is nothing
Our betrayal left it's scars
No more stars

Open up your minds
Realize what lies before your eyes
From truth to lies, freedom dies

Here
We're the children of a world gone wrong
Fear
Entertainment, or just mind-control?

We are led by the liars controling what we are
and above us there is nothing
Our betrayal left it's scars
No more stars
