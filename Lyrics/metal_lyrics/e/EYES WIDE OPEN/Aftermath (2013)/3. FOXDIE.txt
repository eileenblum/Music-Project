FOXDIE, DIE, FOXDIE, DIE

Nanomachines
manipulating the fabric of our DNA
I think it's safe to say
We've been led astray
All of their notions we must obey
Never asking the reason why
FOXDIE

Biological control
Consequence unknown

FOXDIE in your veins
it is waiting to go off

Our hands are tied
as our history constantly repeats itself
Repeats itself
again, again and again
Free will has been denied
and in their shackles we are entwined
Never asking the reason why
FOXDIE

Under patriot control
Faces still unknown

FOXDIE in your veins
it is waiting to go off
We fight to transcend
Will we let them decide
When our lives comes to an end

War has changed
ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagg ed weapons
use ID-tagged gear
Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities
Genetic control, information control, emotion control
battlefield control
Everything is monitored and kept under control
War has changed

FOXDIE in your veins
it is waiting to go off
We fight to transcend
Will we let them decide
When our lives comes to an end
