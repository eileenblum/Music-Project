Face down
Knee deep in dirt, sinking now
Cast another stone
Pouring salt in wounds that bleed

Hollow incriminations carved in stone
Face up

You are blindead, cannot see the light
I am lost and I wonât be reminded
It hurts to bid farewell
But nothing can save you now
This is my last farewell

Face down
Scorned and exposed, left in doubt
In a shallow mind
Truth's a precious thing to behold

Just like a shadow hiding from the sun
Face up

You are blindead, cannot see the light
I am lost and I wonât be reminded
It hurts to bid farewell
But nothing can save you
No, nothing can save you now
This is my last farewell

My wounds no longer bleed for you
My soul no longer weeps for you

Blindead
Blindead
