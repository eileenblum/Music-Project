Spark of life denied
When the bubble bursts and the lights go out again
A fragile shell
Oh, fill the void - I am the void

I try to repent, but the world just tries to kill me

I try to reach out for you
Trying to understand, just what I put you through
Bleeding, screaming, weeping
Oh, why can't you see the conflict inside me

I try to repent, but the world just tries to kill me
I try to repent, but the world just tries to kill me again

This is our last farewell - the end of the line
I tried to repent, but the world just tried to kill me

All this time, I've tried to make the pieces fit
but you still refuse to see...how I try...
...and the world just tries to kill me
I try to repent, but the world just tries to kill me
