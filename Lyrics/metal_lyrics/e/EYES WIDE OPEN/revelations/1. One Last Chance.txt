Here we stand, on another brink again
souls wide open, scratching claws trying to break my skin
Don't you see it's time for us to put an end to this insanity
Just understand that...

I can't hear the words you try to tell me
all I'm hearing is screams and laughter
I can't hear the words you try to tell me
all I'm hearing is screams and laughter

One last chance and I swear this time I'll leave it up to you
One last chance, or I swear this time I'll leave you far behind

Here we stand, we are on the verge again
my heart is bleeding, scars are forming as I waste away

Don't you see it's time for us to put an end to this insanity
Please realize that...

I can't hear the words you try to tell me
all I'm hearing is screams and laughter
I can't hear the words you try to tell me
all I'm hearing is screams and laughter

One last chance and I swear this time I'll leave it up to you
One last chance, or I swear this time I'll leave you far behind

One last chance, or I swear this time I'll leave you far behind...

One last chance and I swear this time I'll leave it up to you
One last chance (just one last chance), or I swear this time I'll leave you far behind (I'll leave you far behind)
One last chance and I swear this time I'll leave it up to you
One last chance, or I swear this time I'll leave you far behind
