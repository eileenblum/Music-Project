The day of reckoning will reach us today
We ignored the signs for far too long
It's time to atone for our sins

It's time to fall, we're losing all
no one will save us now

It's the last day on earth
mother nature needs her time to mend
A majestic rebirth
We'll be baptised in the flames...

...of the end

This is the price we pay for our greed and neglect
The sky will open, the earth will tremble
Tides will wash us away

It's time to fall, we're losing all
no one will save us now
The last day on earth
mother nature needs her time to mend
A majestic rebirth
We'll be baptised in the flames...

It's the last day on earth
mother nature needs her time to mend
A majestic rebirth
We'll be baptised in the flames of the end
The end.
