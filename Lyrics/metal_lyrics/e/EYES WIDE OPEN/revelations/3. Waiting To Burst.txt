Three years in the making and here we are now
we've finally reached the crossroad
My heart is about to explode

Now it seems we're the ones who are lost inside a dream
afraid of waking

All these feelings I've kept inside for all those years
Waiting to burst

Sometimes you got to stop thinking rationally
and go where your heart takes you
We both know that it's true

If you would take the leap I'd be there to break your fall
and never let you go

All these feelings I've kept inside for all those years
Waiting to burst

All this time
That IÂ´ve been waiting (Waiting)
I have been waiting
IÂ´ve been waiting to burst

Waiting (Waiting)
Always waiting (Waiting)
I am waiting (Waiting)
IÂ´m w aiting to burst

All these feelings I've kept inside for all those years
Waiting to burst

All these feelings I've kept inside for all of those years
Waiting to burst

IÂ´ve been waiting (Waiting)
Always waiting (Waiting)
I am waiting (Waiting)
I am waiting, IÂ´m waiting to burst
