Daughters of the dawn walked among the trees
And the forest called for them to join the nightly march
Eternity was present, it touched the hearts of them all
It filled them with joy and neverending peace

They listen to the wind, they pray for relief
The candles enlighten the way, the way of real belief

The wind was there, too, whispering silent words
They heard them, they felt them, they knew it was time for a song
The birds of the woods heard the maidens singing
The silently landed on the circle and shared togetherness

They listen to the wind, they pray for relief
The candles enlighten the way, the way of real belief
