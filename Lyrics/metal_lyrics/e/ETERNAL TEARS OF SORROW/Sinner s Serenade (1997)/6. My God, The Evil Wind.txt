I travel across the sea to the place where no-one's been
Storm clouds above me, blue stream which knows me
Sailing towards the darklands, tales tell me there is a man
He's the evil betrayer, he will die by the hand of a sailor

It's night, I close my eyes, there's no-one here, my god is blind
Gone with the tide, highflying mind... Betrayer!

I'm standing on the sea shore, palms full of black shallow water
A big stone behind me, a pagan statue is all I see
The statue carries a symbol, the symbol of my own god
I travelled so far, I did this all in vein

Salvation to come, God's order to be done?
That man who I can't win, he's my god, the evil wind
