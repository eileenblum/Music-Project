See a raven flying there, the great bird of destiny
Coming from an eternal place where silent river flows
It's my to go to the place unknown... Human harvest
Raven's chore to collect all on board

Endless voyage, trip to sorrow, bleeding tears for unknown tomorrow
I'm living in sin, I am no saint, the raven is singing my serenade

My soul in one tear, my tears on silent river
Silent river in my soul, my river flows no more
Black wind blowing my heart, black raven draining my soul
Chaining my heart, loosing my soul, the raven will follow...
