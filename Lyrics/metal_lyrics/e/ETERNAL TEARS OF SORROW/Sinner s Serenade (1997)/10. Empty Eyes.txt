A little girl, almost a woman
So pretty, so young
Sweet dress, shining hair
Dancing alone above the meadow
Smile on her divine face
Red lips and green eyes
The most beautiful creature
That mortaks have ever seen

But her eyes were empty like a well that has run dry
The mad child is dancing her endless dance at night
Dancing to her death, to the dark open grave
Knowing nothing about her own destiny

One soul has gone
Lost in somewhere
The young mind has fallen
Into misery
Hey little girl
What is in your mind?
Can't you stop this dance you're dancing in the night?

But her eyes were empty like a well that has run dry
The mad child is dancing her endless dance at night
Dancing to her death, to the dark open grave
Knowing nothing about her own destiny

The morning has come
Before our eyes
The young beauty lying
Under the godless sky
The mad child is sleeping
Her empty sleep
And finally leaves
To eternity

But her eyes were empty like a well that has run dry
The mad child is dancing her endless dance at night
Dancing to her death, to the dark open grave
Knowing nothing about her own destiny
