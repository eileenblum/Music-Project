Snow under roaming feet, ice in the ground so deep
I wander to the north in the freezing storm
Trees of the silent night want me to have a hike
Together we shall be like a father and a son

One with the woods, the son of the forest, the name from the past
Peace from inside... The silence of the winter, forever may it last

Clouds in the darkened sky know I'm one with the night
What could I need from the distant world?
Wind blows over my head, blood of the bear to be bled
It's cold out there but I don't feel cold

One with the trees, the son of the forest, the name from the past
Peace from inside... The silence of the winter, forever may it last

Northern lights enlighten my way as I follow the path
Once roamed by my mighty forefathers
