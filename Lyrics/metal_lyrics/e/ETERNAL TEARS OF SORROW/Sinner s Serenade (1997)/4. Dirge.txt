Like the flight of a dead bird my life is going out
Darkness is my mistress at cold full moon nights
Only stars know my paths, I'm a wild wanderer of fields
Lonely trips in my realm... Will you share this with me?

As I howl at night, the wind join my song... Helpless crying of the wild
Am I soulless, forever gone?
After a while I hear a voice from the dark fields of the fall
It puts me the same question:
Shall I ever see the dawn? The sun of the dawn?

The old symbol of all dread, faithful son of the night
Too much bleeding, too much fear
But one's death is other's life
