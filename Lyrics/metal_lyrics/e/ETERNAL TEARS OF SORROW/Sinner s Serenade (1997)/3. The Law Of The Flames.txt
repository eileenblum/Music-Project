Thou shalt not let the witch woman live, the queen of death and life
The mother earth, the mother goddess, the feared devil's wife
From the seven circles of fire she's risen with unholy faith
They want her to die by the cruel law of the flames

The choir of death is singing in the night to kill the female of horrors
She's standing on the srake with innocent heart, with eternal tears of sorrow

Absurd deeds of those, victims of the pagan faith
They kill for all those rumours, she's just born under the flag of hate

The choir of death is singing in the night to kill the female of horrors
She's standing on the stake with bleeding heart, with eternal tears of sorrow
