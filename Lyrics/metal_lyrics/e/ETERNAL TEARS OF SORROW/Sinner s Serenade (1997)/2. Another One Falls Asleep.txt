Red sparks fill the sky and they fall to the earth on fire
The bright stars fade away and the moon is turning to red
The dark woods of the valley whisper stories of an old witch
Living on the great hill covered by ice and snow

The strongest soul above them all start to sing the poem of force
To beat the evil, to beat the night
The troll drum from the dawn of time, build by a shaman from the northlands
Breaks the eternal chains of sleep

The old witch hears the silence, she sees the village enchanted
By the power of her magic, gathered from the mists of the dark
The everlasting winter's draining the power of the people
She feels it in her veins... And another one falls asleep

The strongest soul above them all start to sing the poem of force
To beat the evil, to beat the night
The troll drum from the dawn of time, build by a shaman from the northlands
Breaks the eternal chains of sleep... And darkness...

"My holy ancestors, hear my voice, bless this final fight
Raise this verse to the secret place, where dead birds fly"

I can feel my ancestors to join me and my soul, I feel their power inside me
I can hear the rhythm of my troll drum and how it shakes the earth
I can see the sun rise after all these years, the golden sun rays
And the spell is starting to fade away... To fade away...

So fell the black witch and she froze to ice forever
So came the mighty wind and blew to the dark red sky
Remains of the evil was spread by the north wind
And they formed into bright northern lights

The strongest soul above them all started to sing the poem of force
To beat the evil, to beat the night
The troll drum from the dawn of time, build by a shaman from the northlands
Broke the eternal chains of sleep
