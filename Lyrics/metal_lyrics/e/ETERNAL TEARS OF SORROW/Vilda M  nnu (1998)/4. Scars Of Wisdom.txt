Sometimes it's just the time to rest and leave all your pain behind
Time heals the wounds of loneliness and leaves the scars of wisdom into your mind

Romance, it didn't last Emotions were frozen by the past
My heart bears the scars Wall of pain covers my heart

Yearning to fly once again, on the broken wings of hope I will rise
Flying with a singing nightingale and join the final dawn of my life

See her eye to eye, find the end of time
Falling down so lonely, down to her arms
