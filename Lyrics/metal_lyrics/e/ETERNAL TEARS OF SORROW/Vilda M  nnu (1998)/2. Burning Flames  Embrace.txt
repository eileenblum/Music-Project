Walking towards the night... The flames once burnt inside
Back then I was alive when the fire walked by my side
The screaming fire burnt the leaves of mine and left the ashes of divine
All the leaves contained my name The shadows took them and carried away

Firewalk, I want to feel it again... Dance on the flames, does it feel the same?
Tears of blood, they burn my face... I want to feel the burning flames' embrace

The cold night freezing up my sins, the memories of ice burn my skin
But I see the flames of gold dancing and the last one of the leaves is still burning
Now all the ashes contain my name I'm one with the dark, I've lost the flame
My unleashed thoughts flying to the distant land of dreams... And disappear in the sand

Emptiness has filled my heart... I see a blaze but it's much too far
I try to reach for it, it's calling my name... I know it's my fire with its warm embrace
Like a frozen flower covered with ice, my soul is cold and ready to die
This holy secret turned to a sacred lie I followed it and lost my guide
