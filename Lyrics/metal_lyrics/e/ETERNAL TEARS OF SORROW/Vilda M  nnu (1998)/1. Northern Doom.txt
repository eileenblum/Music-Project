I remember, it was December, the darkest winter, my body shivered
The coldest snow, cold northwind blew, the greatest storm hit like the thorns
The place'd been chosen and God howled there
The wind was his voice, the snow was his soil
Without a heart in those frozen years
His searching ended and my heart was gone

Northern doom, life in the frost
The coldest bloom, the time has stopped
Lethal wind, the freezing orgy
Cold death, there's no glory
Northern bloom, the heart I've lost
The coldest doom, my life has stopped
Killing wind, the lethal orgy
Blood must be shed, mine is this story

Without heart I'm cold as snow, I try to reach for it once more
I follow the sunlight and hear the howl, the last light will end up in God's mouth
I thought I could make it to the end, but finally my faith started to bend
Surviving, it was all I thought, I wanted to live still one hundred years more

I remember, it was December, the darkest winter, my body shivered
The coldest snow, cold northwind blew, the greatest storm hit like the thorns
The place'd been chosen and God howled there, the wind was his voice, the snow was his soil
Without a heart in those frozen years, his searching ended and my heart was gone

He made me bleed when I was asleep, I bled for the frost, I bled for my fears
He stole my heart and carried it away... And when cried, only the echoes remained
Clear wisdom I finally had, I felt so empty, I felt so sad
He took my heart so far away, I started my life as a northern slave
