I close my eyes to see within myself as the first snow falls on me
I close my ears to hear my inner voice and the cold wind freezes me

This is my land, our holy land, I don't want to leave this place
But there are unholy men all around us and they want to take it away
Their hearts are filled with mean passion... Red blood on their hands
Tonight is the last night we're a part of this land

I open my eyes and my ears, I see nothing but darkness
I hear the wind behind the distant hills far beyond this vale

This is my land, our holy land, I don't want leave this place
But there are unholy men all around us and they want take it away
We have to go, travel to the hills, maybe we will find the answer there
Follow me, my people, we must wander to the land of the long shades

I am Alge from the land of WuowjoÅ¡, the only son of Goashem
I'm the leader of these people now from the vale of white reindeer
