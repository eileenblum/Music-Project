Every day is like a new hell, every night my eyes swell
Turn my pain into pleasure, kill my desire for you
My dreams feel so real, they are more than just dreams
I see the Raven in your eyes Come into my grief

I see the Raven in your eyes and my passion rise
After the fevered night, I see through your disguise
Waiting for the sun to rise, my soul will see the light
Forget the thorns the cutting blades, Remember the beauty that fades

Eyes... Eyes... Your eyes... Raven eyes...

Haunt me like a breeze, discover my true dreams
Search for my fantasies, don't forget my fevered dreams
You're my religion that I feel, you're the angel that I see
Dreams of passion come and go... I'm touched by your sweet soul

I see the Raven in your eyes and my passion rise
After the fevered night, I see through your disguise
Waiting for the sun to rise, my soul will see the light
Forget the thorns the cutting blades, Remember the rose that fades

Look inside of me to my soul, see how cold I am
Where does it all begin, and where does it end?
You're still my quiet angel, the angel with Raven eyes
My dear, quiet guide, with black raven eyes
