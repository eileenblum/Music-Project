Die...
Drown...
Fall asleep...
No one will find...

The lives once so innocent,
On the days of the light and joy,
The smiles that melt even ice,
And those eyes made all rejoice

So arrived the man from the shadows,
Riding the beast of the eternal reign,
Sealed their lips by the deepest silence,
Took their lives under the darkest waves

So they drowned...
And they died...
Fell asleep...
And no one found...

At the seventh moon they'll rise,
In the waves of the darkest waters,
By the eight sun they'll die again,
In the dead waters

From the mist they come...
Immortal souls...
The children of the dark waters...
