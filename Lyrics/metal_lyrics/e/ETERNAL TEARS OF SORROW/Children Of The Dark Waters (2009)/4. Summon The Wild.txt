Resounding through the darkness, the summoning of the wild
Be a hunter for the dying or a prey for their lives

Kill for forgiveness, share the grace of revenge
Feel the cleansing cold rain, wash away all your sins

The lust for blood is blinding my eyes,
My flame inside is witnessed by the skies,
For endless life I gave up my soul,
I pray the moon at the hour of the wolves

The bond of blood at twilight,
After the last rays of the sun,
Enjoy the feast of the midnight,
By hunting for the chosen ones

"You must walk on this path, but you will not see the dawn,
It's time to dream of forgone misty nights"

Resounding through the darkness, the summoning of the wild
Be a hunter for the dying or a prey for their lives

The lust for blood is blinding my eyes,
The flame inside is witnessed by the skies,
For endless life I gave up my soul,
I pray the moon at the hour of the wolves
