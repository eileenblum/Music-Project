See through my eyes, my visions, my dreams
You're misled, but now you will learn,
This world is insane and so dead to me,
Through the ancient wisdom you shall find this peace

Chaos and hatred, but my mind is at rest,
No doubt, no fear, let the dead bury the dead
My heart is now burning, but eyes are so cold,
I master my mind, with the secrets I hold
