Cry with me, die with me, burn in hell with me,
And see your clouded mind, intertwined with your hate inside

This path was closed for ages but then I found the way,
It's now your time to face it, it's now your time to pay

When the winter night is the guide out of the light,
You'll see the sky of northern lights,
I have seen the flames inside burning too bright,
We'll share this cold and freezing night

Close your eyes to realize, dream with me to see the signs,
Void and sorrow emptiness in pain,
Tears like the black tar that's running through my veins

This path was closed for ages but then I found the way,
It's now your time to face it, it's now your time to pay

When the winter night is the guide out of the light,
You'll see the sky of northern lights,
I have seen the flames inside burning too bright,
We'll share this cold and freezing night

When the winter night is the guide out of the light,
You'll see the sky of northern lights,
I have seen the flames inside burning too bright,
We'll share this cold and freezing sight... tonight
