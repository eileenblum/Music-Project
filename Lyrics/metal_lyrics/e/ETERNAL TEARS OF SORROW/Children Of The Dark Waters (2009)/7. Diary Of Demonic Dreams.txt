Nightmares...
Shadows on the wall,
Keep me awake through the night,
Faceless man in his chair,
Writing the diary of my life

By the words written in the air,
Controlling every act I take,
Insane visions of the blind man,
Becoming real before my eyes

I'm tied in my dreams,
By the words of the deceased,
The guilt in my heart,
For the deeds I have done in my dreams

My will in dead man's hands,
No one can understand,
What's the outcome of those lines,
In his book of death and life

"He will show you hell, the source of all your pain
Voices in your dreams, driving you insane"

I'm tied in my dreams,
By the words of the deceased
The pain in my heart
For the deeds I have done in my dreams

Kill my dreams!... Kill my dreams!
