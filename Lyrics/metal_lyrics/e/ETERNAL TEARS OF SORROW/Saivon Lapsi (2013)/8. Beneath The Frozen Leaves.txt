Grief is the rust of the mind,
So empty inside,
Awaiting the polar darkness,
It is my time to drown in fear

But I saw it that night,
Glances of hope,
Visions of the blazing stars,
Still I drowned in my sorrow

I walked through the fire,
Got through the ice,
Entered the world of sadness,
I must face my destiny

So I searched for the gate,
Hidden beneath,
The ancient frozen leaves,
And saw the glimmering light

Release her soul,
Lost in the wind,
Forever gone

I walked on the ice,
And searched for the gate,
Found the hidden endless path

I followed the tears,
Saw her by the sea,
Hold her in my arms

Open your eyes, leave it behind,
Breathe again, your dreams may die

Released her soul,
Lost in the wind,
My toil is done
