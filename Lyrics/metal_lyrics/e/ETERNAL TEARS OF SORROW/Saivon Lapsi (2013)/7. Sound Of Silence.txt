Seal your way with the crystal of skies,
Child of the winter, child of the night,
Away from the world so barren and spite,
Cry with the gale on the side of the Northern star

Seal your way with dew drops of the night,
Child of the spring, child of the light,
Fly to the world, sense peace from inside,
Laugh with the wind and sorrow wonât reach your heart

Sound of the silence, sound of my dreams
Sound of the silence, sound of my dreams

Cry out your dreams and live for the days to come,
Sand is flowing in the glass of time,
Donât bleed for the past and drown in the flow,
The rime will melt away... onetime

Sound of the silence, sound of my dreams
Sound of the silence, sound of my dreams
