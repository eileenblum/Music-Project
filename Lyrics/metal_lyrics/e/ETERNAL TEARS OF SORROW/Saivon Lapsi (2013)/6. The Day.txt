Breathing fire, the glance of ice,
Deep below a grave of the divine,
The queen of oceans, the sleeping heiress,
Hear my prayers, hear my wish in the winds

Force of anger, raging tides,
Canât stand this burden, the weight of times,
Unleash your power, release my pain,
Take me down under the whirls of your seas

Going down under your waves,
I cannot wait another day to feed the flames,
Leave all my anguish behind

I drown all my dreams in the darkest tides,
I dance with my demons still one more night,
They haunt me until the day arrives

Fly away, i fly on my wings and die again,
My true will to live has come to the end,
And now my day to die has come
