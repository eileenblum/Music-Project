[Lyrics: Vetelainen &amp; Kokko &amp; Puolakanaho]

Like frozen leaves
We are falling
On to the soil so barren and cold

The rays of sun
No more warming
Our hearts now so cold

Through this field
Of the withered flowers
We go still one more time

The hidden beauty
Forever gone
The river's frozen once again

So came this time
When moonlight blackened my heart:
I can't stand this pain

The chain is broken
It's tearing open my scars:
I want to feel the flame...again

The shine behind
The frozen stream
Reminds me of your eyes

The spark of hope
Still in my heart
Shall dreams become true under the ice?

[Chorus]
