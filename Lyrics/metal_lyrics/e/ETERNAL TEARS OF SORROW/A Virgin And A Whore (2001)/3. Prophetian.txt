A gap between the scenes
Severs the present and the time to come
On the layers of the outer heaven
Hidden omens are found

The one who seeks
May find the end of the line
But the one who also sees
Makes out the meaning of the signs

The brightest star is dying
The forgotten becomes the light
After the seventh circle is complete
Red sand will cover the ground

When the third man arrives
Red blood tames the hate
Gold turns into iron
Into the blade of the tyrant's fate

To the sign of the Raven
I connect my soul and mind
I'm a man with a vision
That is not tide to time

The eyes of the Viper lead 
Me through the darkest woods
Under the wings of the Phoenix
I land onto the nest of the truth
