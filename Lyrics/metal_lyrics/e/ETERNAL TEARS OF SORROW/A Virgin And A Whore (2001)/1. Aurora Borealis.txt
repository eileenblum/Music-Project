[lyrics: Vetelainen &amp; Puolakanaho]

Under a darkened sun they are born
When the moon is losing its shape
I'm here again to see 
The nightly dance of the flames

Once my father bore his sword
To defend the clan till the end
Now he braves the battles 
Between the red northern flames

In the silence of the night
I stare at those ancient lights
Which enlighten the way from the cradle
And lead warriors into the grave 	

They have always been
And they will never change
They light the fire of a soul
And keep it burning bright

And behind the scattered clouds
The star field of the sky
Brings back the dreams I already lost

Shall I ever be like him
The brave warrior of the night,
Whose name will be written 
In the northern lights

[Chorus]
