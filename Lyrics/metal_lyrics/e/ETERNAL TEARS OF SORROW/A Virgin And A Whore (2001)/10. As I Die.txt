[Japanese Bonus Track][originally by Paradise Lost]As I die...
Stare as eyes uphold me
And wait to see right through
And curse me...The love has crippled you
Shadows haunt the nightBurning my disguise
As I die
Reaping through the truthLife becomes untrue

Sin the last diversionMy fate will be untouched
Dismissed now, the anger of a fool
Shadows haunt the night
Forgive me as I die
Taking a chance
And take what you gain
My soul it has no price
Total release is out of harms way until I can decide
You punish me, can't you see, I'm not real
Tears are flowing free, passing by, as I die
