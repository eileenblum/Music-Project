[Music: Kokko &amp; Hiltula]
[Lyrics: Vetelainen]

All alone with bitter thoughts
I swear on the name of my rage
Those who made me suffer will now taste my hate

By the blood of hatred
I seal my wounds so deep
Now it's time to get back what belongs to me

I feel how my strength is growing...
I want to see some more bleeding...

I wait for a dawn to come
When the final war takes the place
And be sure you are the first one who will fall

I laugh on your grave
Instead of praising hymns
Your life belongs to me as well as your soul

By the rusty blade of vengeance
I caress your skin
I'm your saviour from the darker side of the grave

Insane smile now on my face
I cut another wound
It's payback time and I'm the one who pays
