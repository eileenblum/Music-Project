[Lyrics: Puolakanaho &amp; Vetelainen]

The fire in your soul is fading
When our worlds collide
The charming serpent slithers
While an innocent dies

I set a trap of the sneaking temptation:
You know I feel forever desire:

Cleanse yourself of all your sins
I can feel your sinful thoughts
Your looks stain my soul
You are the virgin, you are the whore

Who am I to forgive you?
Turn away from the evil eye
Obey.. You're mine..
Forever:

Get used to the pain now
It's only thing that's real
I've hidden the truth behind the mask
Forever bending the truth

I set a trap of the sneaking temptation:
You know I feel forever desire

[Chorus]

Welcome to the afterglow of my past
The last chapter of the Fall of Man
Still, deep inside your weak heart
You know I'm the one.. For you..

I set a trap of the sneaking temptation:
You know I feel forever desire

[Chorus]
