Prophecies in my dreams
Dark rain forming black streams
When I'm waking up
I can still feel it
The deadly rain all over me
Autumn harvest is here
Time of the greatest loss
Take your final glance now
Prophecies in my dreams
Dark rain forming black streams
I dream of the dree
And the spirits around it
Looking calm, still crying for it all
Autumn harvest is here
Time of the greatest loss
Take your final glance now
As it was once told
Flames appeared in the nightly skies
Above this olden town
We were the ones
To guard you all, to soothe you in pain... In pain
Prophecy's in my dreams
Dark rain forming black streams
I've foreseen the day would come
The city's dead, so few survive
We have always been here
'Round the cherry tree
Trying to comfort you all... in pain
