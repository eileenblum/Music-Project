I caressed her suffering soul
With my love and true desire
But she ripped off my pounding heart
And buried it six feet under
I tried to resist a rhyme
Of charming beauty and lust
But I could not close my mind from tunes
And I fell into the calls of a siren
Bitterness, the black cancer
Slowly gnawing my soul
Disbelief, despair, hatred
This fiendish trinity's taking me over
She was the only one who filled my heart
Sweet Lilith of my dreams
Forever lost
The fallen idol for the impure hearts
Into blazing fire and thunder
I went and followed her
The dire memories in my heart
They will never be dissolved
Condemned to repeat the past
Deja-vu's of things to come
My life is only a vicious circle
It's ending where it just begins
She spoke by two tongues
One for those she loved
Another for the ones she used
For those who dare not look her in the eye
She was the only one who filled my heart
Sweet Lilith of my dreams
Forever lost
The fallen idol for the impure hearts
The dark shadow by my side
The dark raven bride
She was the only one who filled my heart
Sweet Lilith of my dreams
Forever lost
The fallen idol for the impure hearts
