The first flowers of the winter
Dark clouds upon the moors
The falling stars are gathering
Around the heart that once was yours
Winter's here and I'm still waiting
Standing tall, so brave
The sky is black and so is my heart
Waiting at your icy grave
We couldn't hear them creeping
From the deep, nightly shades
So came the ones with dreadful deeds
And their unhallowed blades
We tried to run away from them
I could see the fear in your eyes
They caught us, they shattered your heart
Just wonder why I am still alive
Revenge!
I've been waiting for so long to settle the score
Repent!
My wounded heart bleeds, I can't wait anymore
Desire!
Let the bright full moon enlighten my glorious path
This time...
There's no one who can ever stop my wrath
I've been walking on this path forever
Searching for those to blame
Even though my vindication
Won't be sweet for me or anyone else
Still, every step takes me closer
Till my supreme revenge
Sinking into delirium
My hands were covered with dust
Your ardent soul seemed so calm
Still your heart was filled with lust
The sparkling glance was fading
The snow kissed you goodbye
All that remained was your memory
And the tears in my eyes
