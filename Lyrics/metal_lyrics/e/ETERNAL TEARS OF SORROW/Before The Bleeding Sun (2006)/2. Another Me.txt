In the room of smothered thoughts
Lost in the maze of the mind
I'm searching for myself
Among the shades
Reflection of the dark wraith
The master of my dreams
Behind the smoky glass
He calls my name
Misty voice... Beyond my dreams:
"Join my realm, please come my friend, alone you are so weak"
Charming words... Misleading me:
"I'm your birth and I'm your end, I'll never let you fall"
Lost in the nightly hell
More real than life itself
Travesty of all that
Once was real
I'm crossing the thin line between
Dreams and real life
I'm lost in the insane visions
That are haunting me
I feel the warmth of the false sun
The light of a misled child
It's melting the ice that covers
Another me
