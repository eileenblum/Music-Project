[music: Eternal Tears of Sorrow]
[lyrics: VetelÃ¤inen]

The dance of two free souls...No more masquerades of mortals
Just you and me as nightly guests at the dance hall of our last Autumn
Your look's so faithful, so brave...as you feel our common pain
Our lives and love now in a single stream...the stream of our last Autumn's
grief

Together we lived our lives...and together we will leave...
It shall be the final tie of our bloody seal...
We gave our secret promise on the shore of our red streams...
The bloody oath of real love...the oath of red falling leaves...

Your look's full of passion...as the night kisses your skin
You close your eyes and also let me feel our common will
This crimson stream will be the final step on the path of our mortal lives
You know our love is real...and oh yeah, so do I...so do I

Together we lived our lives...and together we will leave
It shall be the final tie of our bloody seal
We gave our secret promise on the shore of our red streams
The bloody oath of real love...the oath of red falling leaves

Together we lived our lives...and together we will leave
It shall be the final tie of our bloody seal
We gave our secret promise on the shore of our red streams
The bloody oath of real love...the oath of red falling leaves of the last
Autumn
