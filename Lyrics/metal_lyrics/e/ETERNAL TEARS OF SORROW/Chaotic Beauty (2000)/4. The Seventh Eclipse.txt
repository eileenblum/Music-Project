[lyrics: VetelÃ¤inen &amp; Talala]

I see the darkness falling on these fields
I feel the cold hands of the midwinter night
The claws of frost are plowing the naked skin of mine
The painful harrow of the eclipse time

I see the angels falling...their wings so dark
The black spear of the night impales their hearts
I raise my hands towards the sky
And I feel the power of the glowing light

The seventh eclipse is burning my flesh like the shining sun
Another star of the black heaven is going out
The goat of the shadows is praying for the new black dawn to break
The seventh rain will wash all my years away

The fulfilment of this rite of night
Gives me the spirit of the northern pride
The children of the night are singing to me...
I'm one of them...forever free

The seventh eclipse is burning my flesh like the shining sun
Another star of the black heaven is going out
The goat of the shadows is praying for the new black dawn to break
The seventh rain will wash all my tears away

The seventh eclipse is burning my flesh like the shining sun
Another star of the black heaven is going out
The goat of the shadows is praying for the new black dawn to break
The seventh rain will wash all my years away
