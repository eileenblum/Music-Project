[music &amp; lyrics: Dan SwanÃ³]

When I'm in this state of mind I am wishing I was blind
Sometimes life is more than pain to me
I feel the power of my grief, Death would be such a relief
All the secrets that I hide would die with me

Depression is my only friend. Will this torture never end?
Let me carry on to the dreamers' sky
I keep crying in my dreams. Can you hear my endless screams?
When I fade away I fade, away.

Life is just a masquerade. In dept to myself but I can't pay
Soon I'll call it all a day, away.
I've never felt what you call guilt
I still believe "do what thou wilt"
My sorrow will destroy the world I've built

This fluid on my cheek, it drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak.. Black blood, black tears
