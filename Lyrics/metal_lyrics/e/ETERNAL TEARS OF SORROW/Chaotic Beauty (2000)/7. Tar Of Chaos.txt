[lyrics: VetelÃ¤inen &amp; Puolakanaho]

I'm crucified into my dreams
By the hurting nails of my memories
The sword of hate incises...I bleed

And their eyes...
Their look burnt into my mind...
Full of conceit...and despise

The tears of my bitterness
Form the river of my pain
That wildly streams towards the sea of hate

And their voices...
They make my soul bleed...
And the anger inside me will breed

All my life I've grown those roses of rage
I'm the bastard son of hate...
Blood of mine as black as those flowers of death
In my veins flows the tar of Chaos

Once you hurt me
Now it's my turn to join the game
Isn't that lovely feeling to feel the blade of hate?

On the street of the black lanterns
I rape your soul with joy
Just like you did it to me before...

All my life I've grown those roses of the rage
I'm the bastard son of hate...
Blood of mine as black as those flowers of death
In my veins flows the tar of Chaos
