[music: Talala &amp; Puolakanaho &amp; EToS lyrics: VetelÃ¤inen]

When the veil of night covers the whitest orchids of the night
I feel the darkest velvet in my arms

I follow the calling tune, the strains of the darkest night
And enjoy the silent song of a nightingale

I raise the silver goblet full of the nightly dew
And feel the sweetest taste of the darkest tears

The Dark wind of time is blowing...
Years are passing by...
But the sounds of night remain the same...

I see valkyrias dancing with rays of the crescent's light
Their dance is so enchanting...so wild
They come to share the last dance with me
Accompanied by the nocturnal strains

How could I live, if night faded away?
I would lose my shield and the place to hide...
It would be the end of my way from the first dusk till the last dawn...

The Dark wind of time is blowing...
Years are passing by...
But the sounds of the night remain the same...

I see valkyrias dancing with rays of the crescent's light
Their dance is so enchanting...so wild
They come to share the last dance with me
Accompanied by the nocturnal strains
