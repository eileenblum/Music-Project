[lyrics: Puolakanaho &amp; VetelÃ¤inen]

And the ancient mystic words misled me...
They reached my hidden innocence
So the sweetest moments of the perfect beauty...
Turned to the hours of the deepest despair

I'm nothing but a shattered soul...I cannot see...
Been ravaged by the chaotic beauty
Ruined by the unreal temptations...I cannot flee...
I was betrayed by my own beliefs

And my heart betrayed all dead emotions...
I could hear my breath even if I did not breathe
Now the changing tides wash over me...
And the freezing breath breezes through me

I'm nothing but a shattered soul...I cannot see...
Been ravaged by the chaotic beauty
Ruined by the unreal temptations...I cannot flee...
I was betrayed by my own beliefs

I'm nothing but a shattered soul...
Been ravaged by the chaotic beauty...
Ruined by the unreal temptations...
I was betrayed by my own beliefs...
