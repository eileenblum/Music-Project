[music: Puolakanaho &amp; EToS]
[lyrics: Puolakanaho &amp; VetelÃ¤inen]

I can recall the sweet symphonies of my lost side
She filled my dreams with the enchanting aura
But the sweet days of delight were buried in dust
On the battle fields of the unholy hordes

Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and fills the grail of
unholy

I can feel the warmth of those brightest nights
But the shadows still haunt my heart
Over and over again I can see her dying in my arms
Can I ever gather the shivers of my past?

Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and paints the soil of
unholy

Kill...or be killed...
For your roots...and this land...
Live...for the Ancient ones...
Blood of faith...stains my hands

Now my long night is over and the flames witness the new dawn
I'm on the northern throne all alone
Once again I'm here to face my painful past...
Without my queen of the northern star

Sometimes blood paints all to black...and we can't see all the colours
Sometimes the blood of faith stains our hands...and fills the grail of
unholy

Kill...or be killed...
For your roots...and this land...
Live...for the Ancient ones...
Blood of faith...stains my hands
