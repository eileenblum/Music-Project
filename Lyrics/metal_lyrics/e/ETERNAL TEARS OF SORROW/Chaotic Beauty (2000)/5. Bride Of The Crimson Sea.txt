[lyrics: Puolakanaho &amp; VetelÃ¤inen]

I saw her standing by the crimson sea...
Her gazing was intense but so dead...
The teardrops corroded the soil...
She couldn't say a word to me...

I know I want to be the young bride of the crimson sea
I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas
to become the maiden of those crimson skies

Isolated by the silent thoughts...
They were too strong for her mind...
Misguided by the burning desires...
She couldn't resist them at all...

I know I want to be the young bride of the crimson sea
I'm here to join the dark waves on this sacred night
I know I must return my heart to the Gods of the seas
to become the maiden of those crimson skies

I heard her whispers of remorse...
Her naive mind was much too weak...
Her fragile soul was hurt by the night too black...
All she wanted was to be a part of the sea...
