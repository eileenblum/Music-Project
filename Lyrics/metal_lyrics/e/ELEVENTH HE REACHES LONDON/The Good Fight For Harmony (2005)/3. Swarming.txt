They're swarming, they're swarming like Valkyries on Valhalla.
They're swarming, they're swarming as your body lays there complete!
Oh we are!
The truest of the vile.
The sleeping swarm buried in the past.
Sex is fucking us.
And old resolve is buried in the past.
When all we know will carry love alone.
And old resolve is buried in the past.
When all we know will carry love alone be it beautiful or false.
Cut it out, cut it out.
Creating fictitious fantasies deemed as the right of passage by our father figures who bought too highly into reflections of the young adult.
We'll figure it out, we'll figure it out, we'll stay together, we'll stay together.
We'll work it out, we'll work it out, we'll sleep together, we'll sleep together.
And you think I'll never change?
Even though I sleep alone?
While your getting leveled on your back with the self serving touch of man.
We'll figure it out, we'll figure it out, we'll stay together, we'll stay together.
We'll work it out, we'll work it out, we'll stay together, we'll stay together.
And we're dead from the midnight success.
And we're dead from the bleakest carnal sin.
So turn the light out on the nightstand to make loveless men believe!
That vacant bodies through the next door will not hear the 'friction hips'!
You found the right man on the wrong bed, paralyzed by who was last!
Well here he is and full of confidence because I know I broke your heart!
Yeah get me back, it's only fair, by fucking the memory of me out.
Yeah that's a man, but where's the history?
In the end who really cares?
And that's my flag on the tallest mountain!
And that's my mark on the oldest friend.
Divide the divine (we are the Golden Sky Men).
You didn't see her blood because she bled on the inside.
Are you content?
Old resolve is dead!
