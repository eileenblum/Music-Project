Those notes ring loud, if that song played in my house from her hands I'd take her notes away

My father spoke the words "You're tall and grand, like a piano but whose keys were sold for rope"

The world turns brown, the earth my discord note
He sings his song from trees he knows will never grow

"Hey, oh, brother, since you've been away Mom and God have quit their fighting"

"Hey, oh, brother, I often think about which one of us will kill themselves first"

Those notes ring loud, those notes ring loud, play those notes in my house, those notes ring loud

Those notes ring loud, those notes ring loud, play that song in my house, those notes ring loud
