Oh, all my boxes of collectable insects
I've displayed proud in my room
I told my sister, to never let
My mother throw them out

They are my gift
To her child
A reminder
Of the colour
Of the love
And the crime
That my aimless direction
Was directed to strike

Flies and locusts, I dressed as monarchs
Sit in thrones in a kingdom of boxes
I shovelled their guts out, trampled their corpses
And dragged their bodies with oxen

And I left
The court house
Under phantom guide
Of the crescent
Of the lord
And his lions
That face toward, (to each other)
To corner the world

Gaps between, the gaps I slipped through
Endless chasms and moats of kingdoms
I hid in the bracken, I listened and acted
I tore the flesh from the bitch on the throne
I was fucking bulimic to words of jesus
Fucking gospel from science reluctants
I fell in the gaps, the gaps between and
No one ever told me so

Social dissonance, beds of bracken trials and judgements, science reluctants
Social dissonance, beds of bracken trials and judgements, science reluctants
Forced dementia, walls of water
Girt by piss, the waves hit

Ocean spoke to me
We'll sail together, you'll be deck, I'm here beneath you
Human spoke to sea
Human spoke to sea
I'll be your teacher, if you send a wave to drown us
Ocean spoke to me

So young, depressed and inflammable
For as long as I've been living
I hated something above my height
Fathers, Monarchs or Government, so I stole
From innocuous street vendors
I felt like I deserved it all
I needed worth between my hands
To feel what worth felt like, at all

As leave in chains so petrified
I've never liked the sea
Reflecting grinds of unjust woes
As ocean froth so foreign cleanses me
As I scratch away the face
Of monarchs on new currency
I'd snap this worthless coin in half
And drag the ragged edge to die
I woke from dreams about my life
My Mother's smile and Father's fight
A lack of sympathy for my fellow man
In this boat I can finally

Grieve
Of my fate
Of the life I'll waste
And the gaps though the system that I fell
I love the world I live in but I hate the country I've left
I'll change you Australia or I'll leave again with a rope around my neck
Oh I can be brilliant and oh I can change
Oh I'd love to burn the union jack and never grieve again
