Bile stains, on my pillow by my head and there's vomit from my pen
Laid
Out on my bed
Paralyzed dreaming of death

Oh the summer how we cantered proud of each other, proud of the summer
Hair
Drape down like capes
Tangled in knots, covered in sand

Ohhh tangled we get, through tangents of death
Spiraling colours through black holes of culture

I wait...
For ribs to part, reach in and pull out beating organs
And throw the mess to the curious blank of the
Two of us whom started, til two of us got square
We sat and shook like homeless
And reluctantly dissolved

Into the social vacuum
lesser when we left deprived
And lay vacantly
The two of us got started,
then the two of us got square
and rid the woe between us
by fucking hard and
drinking equally

For ribs to part, reach in and pull out beating organs
And throw the mess to the curious blank of the
Two of us whom started, til two of us got square
We sat and shook like homeless
Then Stood and reluctantly dissolved

To the vestige of our state
That observes like flightless owls
While the men drink and note their words to Commonwealth and the Queen

We rely in our mother and our sister that are there to keep our heads
While the men fight like lions, for the Commonwealth and the Queen

I know no men who are lions
Boasting or showing symptoms of life
Live for themselves but not die for the Queen

Men are not lions
Blessed nor confident and living for blood
Proud of the summer and kissed by the sword
That killed off our common sense
The owls and lions are proof

And how I drank, vomited common sense
Oh destoroyer, I've grown up too fast

And how I hung breaking my vertebrae
Held in my fists were the letter to owls

In Soho, In Soho, In Soho see how I hung?
I drank myself to choice
For the Commonwealth and the Queen

In Soho, In Soho, In Soho see how I hung
I gave up on love
For the Commonwealth and the Queen

In Soho, In Soho, In Soho see how I hung?
I drank myself to choice
For the Commonwealth and the Queen

In Soho, In Soho, In Soho see how I hung?
I'd light up on stage
For the Commonwealth and the Queen

My mother lost her way
And my sister turned away

The system got the best of us and that system tore the rhythm from our hearts.
