I work on earth
Baron and brown
Smuggling seedlings
Something will grow

I watch the seeds
Turning a tree
Foreign insects
Trespass the leaves

I work on earth
Baron and brown
Frail and sunburnt
Unlike my tree

It strains away
Gathering height
Closer to God but
Further from me

It joined the earth
Baron and brown
Same in context
I hated its sight

I tore the limbs
Stripped off the bark
If I can't grow here
Neither will he

Iâm allowed to grow
In the vision of God
But he'll strip off my bark if
I grow to the world

Iâm allowed to live
As a symbol of birth
But nothing, no nothing, is ever, ever allowed

Iâm allowed to grow
In the vision of God
But he'll tear off my limbs if I grow to the world

Iâm allowed to curse him
If he's the one that built me
Iâm allowed to use
his fucking name in vain

I dream sleeping beneath it
I dream being its father
Teaching all there is to teach about the world

I'll stretch out my limbs
And outgrow this fucking world
If it gets me killed then so be it
'Cause Iâm tired of the world
And the world is tired of me

The tree won't grow and nor the world around
I never knew that I'd destroy it all

I could plant a seed and grow another tree
But I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
