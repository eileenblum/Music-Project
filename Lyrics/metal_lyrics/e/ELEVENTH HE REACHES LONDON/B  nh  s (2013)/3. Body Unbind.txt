Flayed and disrobed, by the midnight moon, dragging clouds
In the evening, I am hateful and remiss
Sleep by your side, until morning, I'm devalued and ignored

Our bones and body unbind
In the morning light, I hold my bones in jars for you
Bone and body unbind
From the rituals in the night, you write your prose in ash, disrobed

In the morning, I am loving and kind of heart
Raised, under night, by possession and absence of a host
But in the evening, I am haunted by her prose
Sleep under moons, until morning, I'm devalued and ignored

Our bones and body unbind
In the morning light, I hold my bones in jars for you
Bone and body unbind
From the rituals in the night, you write your prose in ash, disrobed

On a cold, wet dawn, you'd left the home again
The blood, bones 'n' ash were back in my skin

Through a haze and fog of morning mist, her prose was bone and ash
Read 'I love no one, but I'm loved by someone else'
Through winter nights I lie in wait for a full moon, bright midnight
But the cold dawn comes and you've found another host

Through a haze and fog of morning mist, her prose was bone and ash
Read 'I love no one, but I'm loved by someone else'
Through winter nights I lie in wait for a full moon, bright midnight
But the cold dawn comes and you've fucked another ghost
