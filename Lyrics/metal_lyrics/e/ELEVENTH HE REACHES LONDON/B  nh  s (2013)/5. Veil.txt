I'm endless spin, glowing veil, slowing pulse
I'm watching foals, scattered bones under trees
I'll walk this home, glowing veil, failing light

The jarrah urn by her side, and my body will be the fire
The glowing veil across my skin, and my body will lay in fire
The jarrah urn by her side, and my body will be the fire
The glowing veil in the night, my body will be the fire
