I was foaled to the south of the house
In the shade of acacia trees
Slowing pulse from the veins in my neck
My lungs are heaving and small
And in my youth I was pried from the home
And walked the mountains, alone
Given love and all of the land
But I'm nothing and no one

And I am
A horse in the trees, bathed in filtered sun and moon
And I was born and loved by all at dawn
And man of wandering star, he's vanished, and I'll follow
And I will die of broken heart alone

I was clothed by the black of the woe
And in trauma, unwanted in low
And cryptic prisms, built from equine bones
I was promised, inducted in code
I was buried alive in my clothes
And woke, being born as a foal
And morning came, I was clean of my hate
I was nothing and no none

And I am
A horse in the trees, bathed in filtered sun and moon
And I was born and loved by all at dawn
And man of wandering star, he's vanished, and I'll follow
And I will die of broken heart alone

To whomever I want, I've wasted half my life
By 'growing up' and mourning loss, but I'm giving up

To whomever I've loved, you never meant that much
I've nothing left, I'm nothing more than bone and ash

Take a walk in the dark and lament all those I've wronged
And plan the end, a quiet death, I am dragging cloud
Written all in code, I am hopeless, without prose
I've nothing left, nothing more than bone and ash

To whomever is left, I am nothing, I am folk
Take a walk, take a walk, now I don't want to live anymore
