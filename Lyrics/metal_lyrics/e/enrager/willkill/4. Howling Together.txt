A howl in the night suddenly opens his eyes,
Looking for his lover in the darkness through the skies.
Together the howls in the night awake her mind,
taking her Flight with her wings arise.

In their endless dance, 
their chase across the land,
where they had promised 
that their love would survive

Howling together, howing forever,
Howling forever more

Damned to be a wolf, damned to chase his love.
But he doesnât know sheâs under the shape of an owl.
The change has begun, he feels his new fangs,
his black-haired back, heâs no more a man.

In their endless dance...
Howling together...

Itâs a desperate timeless game
carried only by the faith
of surviving until a new day...
Waiting for this time to come
even if he dies alone
Howling forever more...

Howling together...
