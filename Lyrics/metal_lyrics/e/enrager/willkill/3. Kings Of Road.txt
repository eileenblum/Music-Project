Wild nights! Highway to horizon,
leaving from the city lights.
Live fast! Burning wheels desires
the adrenaline ishitting hard.
Touring around and melting the ground,
the wild Machines between our legs.
The airâs getting hot, as we ride so strong
like the horsemen of the judgement day.

Feel the engines roar and here we go!
All our major problems stay behind.
Now it doesnât mind âcause we are all...

Kings of road! Never ride alone
Kings of road! Weâre always so far away from home
Kings of road! Never die alone
Kings of road! Looking for the place where we belong

Hot girls! Beer makes it easier
Crazy nights until de road is callin again
Glass hits! Fighting in the club
Our brotherhood agains the saw of thown.
Fire and wind over my beast of steel,
Loyalty and bravery our mÃ ximum hymns.
Thousand times we travel between heaven and hell
Beware âcause here w ego again!

Feel the engines roar...
Kings of road! Never ride alone...

âRidinâ through this world all alone
God takes your soul, youâre on your own...
The crow flies straight, a perfect line
on the Devilâs path until you dieâ

Kings of road!...
