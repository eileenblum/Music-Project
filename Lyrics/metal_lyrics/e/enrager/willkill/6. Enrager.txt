In chaos was forged, never heard before
Crashing chords, unholy notes.
Noise and sickness it was called
Insane madness, the Devilâs word

Rotten minds, rotten hearts
Lying âbout what they donât understand
But in the end theyâll see all their stupid acts
Too late for pray...

Heavy metal breaks the rules
The ENRAGER of all the fools
Donât try to hold me or to stop me
âcause I was

Born in the streets, fed up with screams
Raising our fists, ENRAGER WILL KILL!
A flame in the night, a light in the black
Prepared for attack, ENRAGER COME BACK!

The wild raging beast has awaken at last
ready to crush all the fools on his pass
Wasted tears, burning hearts,
Seed of the future opressed too hard.
Feel the beast running in your mind
Ready to strike?

Heavy metal break the rules...
Born in the streets...

All the lyrics are written by ENRAGER except a fragment in Track 3 "Kings of Road", by Curtis Stigers &amp; The Forest Rangers, 
from the TV series "Sons of Anarchy" soundtrack.
