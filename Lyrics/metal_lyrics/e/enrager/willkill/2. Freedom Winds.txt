Another day begins, a chance to die or live again
To write my destiny, thatâs how it has to be.
Freedom is our flag, fateâs in our hands
Another country, a foregin land
Feeling like the world is mine.

The wind in my face and the smell of the sea,
The roar of the cannons, that means to be free.
No children, no wife, nothing rules my life
Nowhere to call âmy homeâ, just living on my own

I live day by day nothing ties me anywhere
Waves bring me somewhere, courage guides my steps
to a future I donât care

Sailing through thunder and lightning,
feeling the strenght of the sea
The wind whispering in my ears
that I was just born to be free.
All my brothers have fallen
giving their lifes to the sea...
No walls, no chains will never jail
the eternal freedom winds.

Get out of my way, try to stop me or betray
Weâll rise stronger soon, your blood will paint the scum
No gods or kings, the only law, the sea
Religion is not for me, donât let me to be free.

I live day by day...
Sailing through tunder and lightning...

Crying imprisoned in darkness,
those days will never retorn.
They will kill me at sunset,
dreaming to see it once more.
However, it hasnât finished,
my spirit will fly to the sea...
No walls, no chains will never jail
the eternal freedom winds.
