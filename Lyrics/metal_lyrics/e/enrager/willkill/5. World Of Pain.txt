Let me tell you things you canât forget
so youâll hear until the end âItâs your time to fly awayâ
Itâs your time to face your nightmare that stroke you in the dark,
All those monsterâs ainât so far, look around and you will see

The fight for the power attacks with the war
Voices of innocent pray por their souls

Seas of madness, brivery waves,
Greeding blindness, money slaves,
Skies of sorrow, fear and slain,
Welcome to this world of pain.

Now itâs time to choose your road
âcause timeâs coming for you.
You must act like a man â the man!
The man you will be soon,
âcause acting like a fool
youâve got much more to lose.

Daily hunger strikes back on the same
and corruption feeds the flame, pushing people to delict,
pushing people to this streets of poorness with no help or law
Politicians hide their claws, taking Money from us all (Damned bastards!!)

The fight for the power...
Seas of madness...
Now itâs time to choose...

You have to beat that bitch we know as war
and all his pimps who control from afar.
Trust me, if this shit keeps on going like now
No future awaits, end this now!
Welcome to this world of pain!

Seas of madness...
Now itâs time to choose...
