Learn the pleasure
See simple pleasure
You don't always have to run far away,
It's right here under your nose

Look around
See what's around you
You don't always have to run far away,
It's right here under your nose

Take what's worth it give up the rest
Take who's worth it give up the rest
But don't you dare think that you can not loose it
No, no
Don't you dare

See what you have
It's not eternal
You don't always have to run far away
When it's right under your nose

Love who's with you
Stop caring for who's not
You don't always have to run far away
When it's right under your nose

Take what's worth it give up the rest
Take who's worth it give up the rest
But don't you dare think that you can not loose it
No, no
Don't you dare

I will look for happiness in the present
I will save my time for the right ones
I will save my love for the right ones
I will love them before they go
I will save my time for the right ones
I will love them before they go...
