The human taste for destruction
Has been trapped by his own perversion
The machine that is out of control
She will eat us all

And the water the trees the sky the air the breeze
The mountains the seas the life everywhere
The life
... And very soon we will wonder: 'Where has our Heaven flown away?'

The human taste for perversion
Is leading him to his own destruction
The machine that is out of control
She will kill us all

And the water the trees the sky the air the breeze
The mountains the seas the life everywhere
The life
... And very soon we will wonder: 'Where has our Heaven flown away?'
