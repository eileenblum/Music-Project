You've been reaching my heart
And you squeezed it
You've been reaching my mind
You darkened it
You've been playing with my soul
Trying to confuse me on...
On who I really am
And you lost the game

For I'll keep moving on
Can't let the past take hold of me
Non merci, non merci!
I say non merci, non merci!
I can't take the past's comforting hold

You've been painting in white the black memories
You've been adding sparkles to the gentle ones
You've been playing with my memory
Trying to convince me that I should miss...
Miss what was mine
And you lost the game
For I'll keep moving on
Can't let the past take hold of me
Non merci, non merci!
I say non merci, non merci!
I can't take the past's comforting hold
