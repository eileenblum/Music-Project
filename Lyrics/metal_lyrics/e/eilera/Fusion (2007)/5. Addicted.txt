You will travel further away
And go through more adventures
Try and make your heart beat even quicker
With the new and the unknown
With the new and the unknown
You're addicted
To excitement
You're addicted
To stimulation
You're addicted
To intensity
And I want no life without passion
I want no life without passion
... not without love

You'll always find new challenges
You'll always look higher
Happy with a little rest only
Before the next goal to reach
Before the next goal to reach
You're addicted
To exceptional
You're addicted
To complication
You're addicted
To simplicity
And I want no life without passion
I want no life without passion
... not without love
