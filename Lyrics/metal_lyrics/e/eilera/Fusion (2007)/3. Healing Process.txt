Fresh air
Your words help me breathe better
I am traveling with you on your island
My heart beating quicker for too long
Driven away from the genuine
The essentials
And all the while I am wondering, wondering,
Singing one, two, three, four
Would I want you for sex or would I want you for love
Would I want you for sex or would I want you for love
Not enough with the sex I'd rather have you for love...
I think I'm safe here!
Yes I'm safe!
Safe!
I haven't lost it... the dreaming!
I haven't lost it... the dreaming!
I am healing...

Ice cube
Easing the pain on a cheek
Your touch my medicine
And that is puzzling me
That the heart would answer to such a simple
Simple notice
And all the while I am wondering, wondering,
Singing un, deux, trois, quatre
Would I want you for sex or would I want you for love
Would I want you for sex or would I want you for love
Not enough with the sex I'd rather have you for love...
I think I'm safe here!
Yes I'm safe!
Safe!
I haven't lost it... the dreaming
I haven't lost it... the dreaming
I am healing...

Is it love or sex?
What is it, love or sex?

... that was love
