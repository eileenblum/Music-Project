And I'm smiling at what used to make me feel worried all the time
And I'm smiling at what used to make me feel worried all the time
And I'm smiling at what used to make me feel guilty
Guilty
Guilty all the time
And I'm smiling
Yes I'm smiling
... and I'm throwing up all that used to make me feel guilty all the time

Make one with freedom
Make one with freedom

There's something good in the air tonight...
Something fresh and motivating...
Liberating me...
Liberating you...
Delicious breeze of freedom calling me
Tempting me right here in my ear
It's making me excited
A little dizzy
Yeah! Ecstatic!
Mmmmm so happy!
Tell me, tell me:
Can you feel it too?!

And I'm smiling at what used to make me feel worried all the time
And I'm smiling at what used to make me feel worried all the time
And I'm smiling at what used to make me feel guilty
Guilty
Guilty all the time
And I'm smiling
Yes I'm smiling
... and I'm throwing up all that used to make me feel guilty all the time

Make one with freedom
Make one with freedom

There's something cool in the air tonight
I wanna dance and I wanna go wild
On the top of the highest mountain
Do you?
And I'll go swim naked feel the caress of water all over my body
Will you?
It's making me excited
A little dizzy
Yeah! Ecstatic!
Mmmmm so happy!
Tell me, tell me:
Can you feel it too?!

Can you feel it too...
Can you feel it too...
I am free... I am free... Are you?
I am free... I am free... Are you?
... I am free...
