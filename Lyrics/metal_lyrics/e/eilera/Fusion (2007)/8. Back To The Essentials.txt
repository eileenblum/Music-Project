Today I found a treasure
It was not buried in the ground
But floating there above the ocean
And coming closer to the land:
The lord of storm in his best outfit...
He's looking my way...
I can not turn away and look for a shelter
I have to see, hear, feel
I can not turn away from this gift of nature
I'm welcoming
Thanking
Thanking as I am

Reaching the essentials
I am reaching life
Getting closer I'm building myself
Getting closer I'm building myself

Now water is running over my face
And the wind is dancing all around
Extreme energy and gentleness
Are making one
Electric spears descending through sheets of water
I'm feeling vulnerable
I am fascinated by so much perfection
I'm welcoming
Thanking
Thanking as I am

Reaching the essentials
I am reaching life
Getting closer I'm building myself
Getting closer I'm building myself
