Little people defying the cold
Little people defying the old

Playing outside
Pink cheeks, wild smiles
They're sparkling
Sparkling with life

Snow is slowing down all movements and sounds
Also
Maybe it will slow down time

Older woman beside her window
Older woman watching with a smile

The little people
Playing where used to play once
Sparkling
Sparkling with life

Snow is slowing down all movements and sounds
Also
Maybe it can slow down time
Snow is slowing down all movements and sounds
Also
Maybe it can slow down time

There's a mirror beside her window, she stares in
With a smile she touches the lines around her eyes
There's a mirror beside her window, she stares in
With a smile she touches the lines around her eyes

She is sparkling with light, sparkling with light
She is sparkling with life
She is sparkling with light, sparkling with light
She is sparkling with life
