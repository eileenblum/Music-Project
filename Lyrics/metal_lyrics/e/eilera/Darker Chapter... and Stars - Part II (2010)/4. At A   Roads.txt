You're standing at a +roads
L on you right
D on your left
How come you're looking left for the first time?
Yet something's holding you back

His words they gave you comfort
Made you belong
They made you feel
There's an easier path for you to walk
And for the first time not alone

So you lay down
On the earth
And ask her for answers
...and she is whispering them to you...

Your open mind
Your knowledge
And deep down your soul
...they're all whispering them to you...

'Cause they're your best friends now
Tearing the walls down
And letting light in again
This light, you will follow

'Cause they're your best friends now
Tearing the walls down
And letting light in again
This light, you will follow:

It's your own

'Cause it's your own
'Cause it's your own
'Cause it's your own
Light

You're standing at a +roads
Light on you right
Dark on you left
Could you chose to be blind for the first time?
And think with someone else's mind?!
His words they felt like cotton
Preaching the right
Preaching the wrong
He put a friendly arm around your shoulders
Then you felt there was something wrong

...As you felt the taste of the poison that would
Slowly, surely
Kill your freedom

So you lay down
On the earth
And ask her for answers
...and she is whispering them to you...

Your open mind
Your knowledge
And deep down your soul
...they're all whispering them to you...

'Cause they're your best friends now
Tearing the walls down
And letting light in again
This light, you will follow

'Cause they're your best friends now
Tearing the walls down
And letting light in again
This light, you will follow:

...It's your own

'Cause it's your own
'Cause it's your own
'Cause it's your own

Light
