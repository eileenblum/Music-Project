I'm waking  up in the night
I've seen you again
Your blue eyes were staring at me like last time we met
So cold and hard and mean even
How can you do that?!
When a few days ago only I was in you bed...

Was it always a lie? When we were making love baby
Was it always a lie? And passion blinded us both
...was it always lie

I'm missing your arms around me
I'm missing your hands
Running all over my body
The peace I felt
And the fire that never stopped burning, even in the end
When we had become two strangers exhausted by pain

Was it always a lie? When we were making love baby
Was it always a lie? And passion blinded us both
...was it always lie

Leave on last time the warmth in me felt the ice in your veins
Let's one last time meet the heavens in an honest embrace...

Then I'll go
Knowing I still love you
I'll go
I know it's better to
I'll go
But before I do I have to know
But do you?
I have to know!
Was it always a lie? When we were making love baby
Was it always a lie? And passion blinded us both
...was it always lie

Was it always a lie? When we were making love baby
Was it always a lie? And passion blinded us both
...was it always lie
...was it always lie
