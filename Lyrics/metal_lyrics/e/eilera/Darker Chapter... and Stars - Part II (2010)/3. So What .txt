There was no blood on the sheets afterwards
There was no pain in the sounds that were coming
Out of

My mouth
Wide open
My head
Falling backwards
The light on my face
Is coming from
The inside...

No there was no blood!
You're right
You were not the first one I loved
So what?!

It is you I'm making love with now
You and no-one else
It is you I'm loving babe yeah
It is you I'm making love with now
Yes, I know
They'll call me names
So what?!

There was no blood on the sheets afterwards. You're
Right
Bu there was love! All the way. Purest energy you'll
Get no other way

Should I give this love to your god instead?!
Would it make me purer
To yours eyes then?!

How blind are you if
You cannot see
That the love I gave to you is
The purest thing

It is you I'm making love with now
You and no-one else
It is you I'm loving babe yeah
It is you I'm making love with now
Yes, I know
They'll call me names...
So what?!
So what
So what
So what what what what?

No god would punish love
