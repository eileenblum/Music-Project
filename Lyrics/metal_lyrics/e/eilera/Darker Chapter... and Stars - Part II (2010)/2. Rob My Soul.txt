'Cause I'm free
It scares you
It shakes you too hard in your world of
Rules

So you try hard to come poisoning my brain
And every gently
Take hold of my soul

All your words are evil
Disguised into friends
Who very gently

Rob my soul

Now you push me away

What you fear the most

It tempts you
What you fear the most

Too

So you try hard to come poisoning my brain
And very gently
Take hold of my soul

All your words are evil
Disguised into friends
Who very gently
Try and rob my soul

Rob my soul
Rob my soul
But you won't
Rob my soul
