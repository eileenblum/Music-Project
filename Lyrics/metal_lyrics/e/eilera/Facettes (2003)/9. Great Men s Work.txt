A bottle of coke in an Inuit's igloo
Another culture eaten, digested, spit out
A desert of ice spotted by US camps
And nature rapedâ¦so let us sing for:
These great men's work
And their motivation
To destroy our world
For us, never for money!
One more drop
Can't they see that the vase is so full already
One last drop
And the sinking will spare nobodyâ¦
A simple number lost in today's paper
The death of a whole forest
Calling, bleeding
An unusual red mark on your cream-covered skin
The planet revengingâ¦so let's all sing for:
These great men's work
And their motivation
To destroy our world
For us, never for money!
...and their motivation
...say thanks for!
...and their motivation
Always for money
For money!
