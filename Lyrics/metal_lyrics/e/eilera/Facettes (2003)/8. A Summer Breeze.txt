In the middle of nowhere I awake
Far away from my usual context
Wondering why I'm here
Here I feel differently
In the middle of nowhere I awake
Unaware that I'm free
Out of our jail
Suddenly happy in me
And the music's bringing us togetherâ¦
And the music's bringing us togetherâ¦
People whom I felt alien to me
Altogether for three days of magic
With nothing else to think
Very close finally
In the middle of nowhere I awake
I'm aware that I'm free
Out of my jail
Suddenly all is clear in me
And the music's bringing us togetherâ¦
And the music's bringing us togetherâ¦
