Here I am inside my cave
Far away from what can hurt me
From the man and from the men
No way I'm living there ever again
Like in my mum's belly I lay
Only this time I'm here to stayâ¦
And the storm has come again
Some will say that it is scary
Me I know nature won't betray
No way I'm living there ever again
Like in my mum's belly I lay
Only this time I'm here to stay
There is some room for you
So come close and I'll be sure
That I can take care of youâ¦
