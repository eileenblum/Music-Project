See the signs of uncomprehension
They seem to be so usual
I would like to get rid of uncomprehension
And find the peace we're looking for
But there's no wayâ¦
No there's no way...
Too scared to see the wayâ¦
Wonder why all this uncomprehension
I guess it is 'cause
You're a man
And I am not
No I am not
Need to find a way out of this situation
When we keep hurting each other
I would like to get rid of uncomprehension
And find the peace we're looking for
But there's no way
No there's no way
Too scared to see the wayâ¦
