Don't know yet if I'll find back my friend
Gone three years ago
To her castle in a far-away land
Today I'll knowâ¦
When the feeling's still so strong I bet
That our tale has no end
I'm your little sister
When year after year our friendship says
That our tale has no end
I'm your little sister
Seven days of peace in five people's hearts
The most precious gift
A little nostalgic on the side
But what a great reliefâ¦
When the feeling's still so strong I bet
That our tale has no end
I'm your little sister
When year after year our friendship says
That our tale has no end
I'm your little sister

Seven days of peace in five people's hearts...
A little nostalgic on the side...
