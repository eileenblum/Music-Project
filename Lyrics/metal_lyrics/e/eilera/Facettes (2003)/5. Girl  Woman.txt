Is it my bed?
Or is it my coffin?
Sometimes for dreams
And others for death
Both of the girl and the woman
To be happyâ¦
You call me lunatic
Or you can call me immature
But you gotta love me for
What remained pure
Both of the girl and the woman
To be happyâ¦
You got to explain to me
These things puzzle me so much
How can sex be used for
Both love and for destruction
Both of the girl and the woman
To be happy
