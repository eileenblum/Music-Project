He looked in my eyes and said
He was looking for
The warrior in me.
But he will not find him
Today he's having a
Little break
Not ashamedâ¦
For today
Beauty is allowed
For the eyes,
For the ears,
For the mind and for the soulâ¦

And right after
The magic begins
Strong enough to
Clean everything inside
We're in the mountains
Feeling again
Alive again
In the mountainsâ¦

A little break

I look all around me
And I,
I can feel the strength,
The splendour
The freedom
As for the dog
She is so happy!
Ain't she mum?
â¦So happyâ¦
Not another setting
For hateful robots
I do not play
In that play
We're in the mountains
Feeling again
Alive again
In the mountainsâ¦

A little break

Oh the waterâ¦
Oh my reflection
The wind playing in my hair
And the rhythm
It's taking me into a trance
My senses coming
I'm in the mountains
Feeling again
Alive again
In my mountainsâ¦
In my mountains
Feeling again
Alive again
In my mountains
