Sometimes, I try to understand this enigma
How can I wish to be left alone?
When inside I keep making up these men, these girls
Why not keep the real ones?
â¦the real ones
Two opposite ways which I walk
Without a chosen destination
A new ambiguity
A little more of me
A new ambiguityâ¦
I guess I should not lose more time on the subject
The answer will be buried together with me
â¦together with me
Two opposite ways which I walk
Without a chosen destination
Two opposite ways which I walk
Without a chosen destination
A new ambiguity
A little more of me
A new ambiguityâ¦
