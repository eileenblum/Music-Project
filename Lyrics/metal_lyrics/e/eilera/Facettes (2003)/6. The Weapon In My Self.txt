Once again
You've been lying to me
And again
Thinking you're so high above me
Each time brings the weapon in my self
(I can hear her nowâ¦)
I can hear her now singing me
This flood of happiness
Running in my veins
Which makes me invulnerable
Go on like this
And you will regret it
I'm not that naÃ¯ve
But you're obviously that stupid
Each time brings the weapon in my self
(I can hear her nowâ¦)
I can hear her now singing in me
This flood of happiness
Running in my veins
Which makes me invulnerable
