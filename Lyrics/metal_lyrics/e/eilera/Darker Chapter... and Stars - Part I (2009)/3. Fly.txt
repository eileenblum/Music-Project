Don't think
Don't fell
You've done your work
Good girl
You can go play now

We think
We feel
For you our work
Is to simplify your life

...Time for sleep now...Turn off the light...

Do not
Disturb
And we like you
Think too much
We'll remove you

You be like us
And we like you
Too different
We remove you

...Take your pill now...Turn off the light...

This cage is far too small for you
The whole world lies at your feet
So step in!
Step in!
And dare follow your dreams

Soon the walls will be so high that they will trap you in the dark
And force you!
Force you!
Force you to calm down

...And the fire I love so much in you will die...

So fly!
Fly!
Fly and stay true to yourself
So fly!
Fly!
Fly and stay true to yourself
So fly!
Fly!
Fly and stay true to yourself...
'Darling, remember to live your one life...'

Do not
Disturb
And we like you
Think too much
We'll remove you

You be like us
And we like you
Too different
We remove you

...Take your pill now...Turn off the light...

This cage is far too small for you
The whole world lies at your feet
So step in!
Step in!
And dare follow your dreams

Soon the walls will be so high that they will trap you in the dark
And force you!
Force you!
Force you to calm down

...And the fire I love so much in you will die...

So fly!
Fly!
Fly and stay true to yourself
So fly!
Fly!
Fly and stay true to yourself
So fly!
Fly!
Fly and stay true to yourself...
'Darling, remember to live your one life...'
