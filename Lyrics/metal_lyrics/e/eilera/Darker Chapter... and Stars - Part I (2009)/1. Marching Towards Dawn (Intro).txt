We're marching towards dawn
Together with hope
We're ready to fight
For the good things on the earth

We're marching on the same side
Towards wisdom and trust
We've had enough
Of betrayals and lies

We're marching
On the same side
Together with the earth
Remember where we belong
And where we come from

We're marching on the same side
And against the evil
That's turning us to machines and our heaven to ruins

We're marching towards dawn
