She wakes up early morning
She wants to run outside
And see the blue sky the light
And feel the freedom
That's finally back

She feels so much alive
She doesn't want to waste one more
Minute of her time

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...She is Lucie after war

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...She is Lucie...

He is still early morning,
Inside the belly of the tank
That rolled over too many
Of the so-called evil men

He wants to feel freedom
He jumps down to the ground, back to
Life! Back to see light again!!

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...There he sees Lucie after war

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
He sees Lucie...

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...Then he sees Lucie after war

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
There she is, Lucie...

Who said they should hate each other?!
Who said they should kill each other?!
The bitter words of the dark, hateful
Ones
Could not reach their hearts

Who said they should hate each other?!
Who said they should kill each other?!
The poison from the narrow-minded ones
Could not reach the hearts
...of those who knew love
...of those who knew love
...of those who knew true love
...of those who knew love

War, Light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...Thank you Lucie after war!

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
Thank you Lucie...

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...That day love won over war!

War, light!
After war, light!
After war, light!
...Thank you Lucie after war!
