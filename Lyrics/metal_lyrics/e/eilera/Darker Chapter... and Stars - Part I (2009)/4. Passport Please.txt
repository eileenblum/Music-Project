You are thinking of me that I'm a whore
You are hating me for what my country did to yours

I'm standing in front of you
My whole me is being so confused
My blood isn't hot nor cold
My body's sending me these weird signals: 'We could have been lovers'

We could have been lovers
In another world
And in different times

We could have been lovers
In another world
And in different times

Where there'd be
No border for our love
No there'd be
No border for our love
... Wake up!

Give me my passport back, stop wondering
If I'll go first thing fucking for money

May your brain think for itself
May your feelings go virgin again
May you remember who you were
Before you were thought to fear and hate!

... 'What I can see of you in your eyes is too bright to go on thinking that way...'

We could have been lovers
In another world
And in different times

We could have been lovers
In another world
And in different times

Where there'd be
No border for our love
No there'd be
No border for our love
... Wake up!
There'd be be no borders for our love
Wake up!
There'd be no border to love

No border to love!
