I cannot tell you how much I miss you anymore
So I say it to the blue mountains
My words fly away, try and reach their wisdom
Find peace in their humble beauty

It hides behind a veil of mist
Mist again, it's between us now
And my memory of you is fading away
Together with my pain...

Stand up
And feel the wind
Breathe deeply
And feel alive
It feels amazing, doesn't it?
It feels amazing... Doesn't it?!
O yeah...[x2]

The new season came and the mountains wear
A deeper blue
Like in my eyes
You never learn as much as when you go through pain...
I'll be on my road again...

Stand up
And feel the wind
Breathe deeply
And feel alive
It feels amazing, doesn't it?
It feels amazing... Doesn't it?!
O yeah...
