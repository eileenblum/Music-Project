One last kiss before you go away
I'm doing my best not to cry

I'm hating these soldier clothes you're wearing
Mere camouflage to hide the man

...And turn you (in)to a weapon

Will they turn you to a weapon?
Will you go die for
The wrong reasons?

Don't go fight for the wrong reasons,
That's all I'm asking you
If that's what you have to do
Then I'll be supporting you
But 
Don't
Go
Fight
For order only...

I know I used to accept blindly
Used to trust in my country

That was before she sent her children
To die without wisdom

...Without an honest and good reason

Without an honest and good reason
Will you go die for
The wrong reasons?!

Don't go fight for the wrong reasons,
That's all I'm asking you
If that's what you have to do
Then I'll be supporting you
But 
Don't
Go
Fight
For order only...

The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. 
You wonder what his name is or.where he came from. 
And if he was really evil at heart. 
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. 
If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace. 
War will make corpses of us all.
