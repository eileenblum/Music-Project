Snowy, peaceful, grand
My mind's wondering on this land
How better I understand
The bright and serene outside
And the warm sap running in
Boiling, boiling
Pulsing, pulsing
Living, living
Explosive, explosive
As cold and heat can harmonize
As sour and sweet can embrace
I could be your wild one
You could be my guy, right?
You could be my wild oneâ¦ all right!

You say it's because of his young age he won't obey
I say a free heart won't be caught
With reins, time and reassuring talk
The flame inside will stay!

Care, warmth, loving arms
Little breaks for the wild horses' hearts
Boiling, boiling
Pulsing, pulsing
Living, living
Explosive, explosive
As cold and heat can harmonize
As sour and sweet can embrace
I could be your wild one
You could be my guy, right?
You could be my wild oneâ¦ all right!

As cold and heat can harmonize
As sour and sweet can embrace
I will be your wild one
You will be my guy, right?
You will be my wild oneâ¦ all right?
All right then!
