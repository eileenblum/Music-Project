High up on a wooden mountain
Blurred sight of a sea of trees
I feel
The warmth in my veins
I feel
The cold on my face
(I'm) living
A moment of peace, of grace
And I know it scares you but:

How I love to share this with you

You're moving closer, looking for warmth
I see deeper in your blue-grey soul
And it's securing, securing and frightening
It's proud and strong, and yet full of innocence
Some snow wishing
Wishing to melt away
And I know it scares you yet:

Oh you love to share this with me

How I love to share this with you
Oh you love to share this with me
This precious moment with you dear...
