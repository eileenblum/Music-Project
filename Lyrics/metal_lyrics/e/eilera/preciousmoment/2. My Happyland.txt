I think I was about five or six when I chose my own Happyland;
Certain of what it would beâ¦ Which way to take? I had no idea!
So I looked for the map that could lead me there and I found it nowhere
'Cause the only brain that could trace it down was mine

The journey to my Happyland
I found the way toâ¦ home

I went across the Channel, the Baltic Sea,
Through grey or green, on mountains, in valleys
Guided by my passion, my energy
And this will to see more and see and see!
Eager to discover, hear and speak, and share, and build,
And build and build!
With each new taste of dream a bit of my own world

The mist is fading away
Can see what will be taken away from me

The journey to my Happyland
I found the way toâ¦ home

And the hardest the wind blew
The closest it took me from the land
And the hardest the wind blew
The furthest it took me from you

The mist has faded away
Can see what has been taken away from me

The journey to my Happyland
I found the way toâ¦ home
