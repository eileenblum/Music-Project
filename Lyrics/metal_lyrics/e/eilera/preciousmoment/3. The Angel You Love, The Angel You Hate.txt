I wake up there's a lit candle on the table you
Got up early for me today's my birthday
You've remembered...

I'm the angel you love
The angel you hate...

And I'm sorry I've stained your purity...I'm sorry

All you say is right my heart is full of dreams
Never to be satisfied eternal quest for beauty
And this poison in my veins that you love you fear you hate
I've loved you and I still do
Ambiguity girl wants everything
...always...

I'm the angel you love
The angel you hate...

And I'm sorry...

I see you from behind you don't know I'm still looking
There's a pinch in my heart there's water in my eyes
There's panic and relief
Fire and snow
A rainy sky crying drops of sun

I'm the angel you love
The angel you hate

And I'm sorry I've stained your purity...I'm sorry

You burned your fingers on the flame of love, did you?...
Mine are still smoking...
Painful...
Painful
