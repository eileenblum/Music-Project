You know Im not here to stay
(playing the fool)
All the senseless shit you tell
(now Im telling you)
Give me love and give me hate and give me pain
Give me blood I dont give a fuck to your faith

Please kill me please thrill me
Give love and say that you want me
Please shoot me down before I kiss you
Please kill me, and Im gonna miss you
Please kill me please thrill me
Give love and say that you want me
Please shoot me down before I kiss you
Please kill me
Please kill me now

Every shot you gave to me
(is now killing you)
Im the poison in your veins
(the poison of truth)
Give me love and give me hate and give me pain
Give me blood I dont give a fuck to your faith

Please kill me please thrill me
Give love and say that you want me
Please shoot me down before I kiss you
Please kill me, and Im gonna miss you
Please kill me please thrill me
Give love and say that you want me
Please shoot me down before I kiss you
Please kill me
Please kill me now

Won't you kill me now?
