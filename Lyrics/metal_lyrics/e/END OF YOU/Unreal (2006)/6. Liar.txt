I may wonder why
I donât like the way I am supposed to feel
- All the things I like
How could I deny
Who I really want to be
- If I just could

Reason why I
Donât know the difference between you and the rest
- Because no one cares
Want to lie?
Do you want to be the only one?
- Well, you arenât wrong

[chorus]
I got to say
I need to say
I want you to hear me, is not too late
Donât walk away
Show me some faith
Just one more day and I show you the world

I may wonder why
I donât like the way I supposed to feel
- All the things I like
Want to lie?
Do you want to be the only one?
- Well, you arenât wrong

[chorus]
I got to say
I need to say
I want you to hear me, is not too late
Donât walk away
Show me some faith
Just one more day and I show you the world
Because I will be
The one who cares
And I will be here just for youâ¦

Here we are
Step aside
Because we lie
We donât mind
We hear what we want
Will it be alright?

[chorus]
I got to say
I need to say
I want you to hear me, is not too late
Donât walk away
Show me some faith
Just one more day and I show you the world
