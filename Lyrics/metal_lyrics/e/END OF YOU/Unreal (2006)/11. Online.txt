[bonus track]

Waiting online
You and I are united
I want to look inside me
Itâs the only thing I feel
Lonely thinking
Am I always right?
I want to say how sorry I am
I wonât let you free
Lonely day
I will make it right
Just say the things that you want
I will make it true
Finally I got nothing to say
Show time is over for me
I just need to find a way
Everything you always wanted
Dream yourself far away, just let it go
Waiting online
You and I are united
I want to look inside me
Itâs only thing I feel
Do you wake up seeing shadows?
Itâs already late
Someone is staring at you like he knew your name
Do you ever feel that you are the chosen one?
Like he feels the same
Like he knows who you are
