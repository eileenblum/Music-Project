This time I know what I feel
And why it's happening to me
If I forget everything
It's okay because I do it for me
I give you time, I give you space
What more do you want from me?
If I do what I like, why wonât you do the same?

Come and walk with my eyes
Come and walk to my life
If there is nothing to me
I cannot get everything
I give what is already in there
If there is nothing below
How do I know what I miss?
What more do you want from me?

This time I know what I feel
And why it's happening to me
If I forget everything
It's okay because I do it for me
I give you all what thereâs to take
How long it lasts before I fall?
Is it real what you fear?
Is it me or you to hate?

If there ainât nothing below
How would you know what is already in there
If there ainât nothing to me
How would you know, what more do you want from me
