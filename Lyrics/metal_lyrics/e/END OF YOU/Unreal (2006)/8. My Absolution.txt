I can't see things too clear now
I don't remember where we were
Our last stop in the shadows
I can't be too patient any longer
If it's in my will, I shall run my god down

What have I done, I canât remember
Waiting for the shipment, looking for the one
Wise guy who gives me wisdom
My absolution
No one can judge me

Why are you trying for?
Running through the wall
Always right or wrong
Why are you trying for?
Someone break the wall
Always right or wrong

Waiting while the life goes by
Hoping that tomorrow is just fine
But it ainât, it canât be, if you are not around
Little things that make you want
Make you want more and more
Another dream, another hell, another fall
