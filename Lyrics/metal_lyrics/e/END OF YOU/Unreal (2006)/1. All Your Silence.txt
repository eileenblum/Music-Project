All your silence

All your anger
All your rage
Everything fades away

When I look at you
I see silence in me

All your tries
All your faults
You keep pushing ahead

When I look at you
I see silence in me

Tell me your story
Behind your eyes
Like they were mine
Like it belonged to me

All your silence
All in me
All your covers
All your being

When I look at you now
I see silence in me

Falling down
Take me down, take me close to the ground
Truthful lie
Deep inside, deep inside my mind
War is over
Why are you running for, just stop
There's a reason for all or no reason at all
