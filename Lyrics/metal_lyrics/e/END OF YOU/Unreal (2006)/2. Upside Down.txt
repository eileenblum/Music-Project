Going around
I just can't believe it
Everything goes
Upside down
Fall's apart

Through your fears
Through my pain
All this silence
How is it going to be?

Rise
Rise above my mind
Make it all whole again
Reason to fight
I just need to rise
Rise above my mind
Make it all whole again
Reason to fight
I just need to

Go forward, go through the shadows
Learn how to be what you are not
Use your time to find out why
Why canât you just let it be?
Why
Say you don't want it
