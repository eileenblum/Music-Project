It takes guts to show yourself
It takes guts to stand your ground
When you are breaking into the pieces
You try to catch, you try to hold on
What ever you can find
It will not be so easy

Make it through the day
Make it through all the way
Violence comes with violence
Peace brings you nothing
You got yourself a new game
You got yourself more to lose
Bet on black, but house takes it all

What ever comes through you
What ever comes inside your mind
Donât you try to fool me
Donât you try to keep me here behind
I drive myself insane
Iâm making it fade away

Before you make up your mind
Before you choose your side
Before you say, what is your way,
You must decide
What is right
