I want the same
Same as you
I donât care what they say
Or their expectations

Time is precious
It cannot be wasted
So why does it fade
Fade away

I need you today,
Take your pride and feel your shame with me
Donât you blame, walk away
Thereâs no turning back, since you are lost again
Take your pride, feel your shame
For me itâs the same, what you think or like
Make it true, let it be
Take your pride and feel your shame again

I have the right to
Come up and judge you
Since when you started to think?
That you can fool me
I have come too far, I canât turn back now
For me itâs the same what you think or like
