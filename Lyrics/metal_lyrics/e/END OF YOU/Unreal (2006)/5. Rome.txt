Burn your wings in my flame
Flying too close to the sun?
Raise your hand and bow to me
Feel your lust, while Iâm bleeding

Watching the world
Whole world in my arms
One minute away
You canât see me hiding
Taking my place
In my war
I tell you arise
No time for dying now

People gathering around me
No fate is left for my cause
I choose not to fear you
But I can see it in your eyes
