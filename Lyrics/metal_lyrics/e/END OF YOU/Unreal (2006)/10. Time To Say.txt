I feel Iâm alive
I canât say Iâve tried
In my dreams Iâm going ahead
I seek I find
I open my eyes
I feel Iâm lonely again
I wonât make the same mistake again
Time to make it
Time to say
Things to say
My name is gone
I feel Iâm going away
My fight my rest
I need no hope
I feel Iâm falling again
I wonât make the same mistakes
Ages and ages waiting
Truth is this is a lie
I will do I will go
Anything I try to do
Anywhere I want to go
They will find me
They wonât leave
Do I really want to be alone?
