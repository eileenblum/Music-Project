Follow my name
No need to be afraid
'Cause you can't hide
When world is in flames
Drown to the light
When I talk you through
Believe every word
I'm on a mission to moon

I feel my wars
I loose them all
I take your hand
I feed you all
The time will come
When you prove I'm wrong
I fall from your heart
I try to please you all

We all want to be loved

I told you I would do it
I never told you why
I don't want to find out
I'm one of those who gives and takes
Before they start again

I told you I would do it
I'm burning inside
I don't want to find out
I'm one of those who gives and takes
Before they start again

Time will change
But still it's in the range
For the sake of brothers
For yourself and others
I got a lot of faith
Teach me how to fight
Is it worth the trouble?
Killing in the name of

I give
I steal
I love
I'm going on parade
I need
I fall
I'm turning to a star
I rule
I know
I've seen this all before
