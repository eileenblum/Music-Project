You're moving between
Time and space
Deceiving me
Your lack of time
Rays of light
Something between

Knock yourself out
Get your keys
From another me
Build your alibis
In every you
There's is me

Feel my rage
Just Stay away
Getaway
Return my life intact
I want it back

Are you loaded again
Fooling around or here to stay
Violating truce
It's your way of sinking me

Welcome
Choose wise
Good bye
No one
Could die
More than I
