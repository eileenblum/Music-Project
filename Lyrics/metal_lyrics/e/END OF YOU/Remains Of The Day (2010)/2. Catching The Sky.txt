Take a look at your soul
To see what it takes
How black can it it be?
Just breathe the pain
You hit the bottom
You know where I'm going
Devil ends up like you
There's no turning back

It all ends tonight

True to me
It will come
Just wait and see
I will tell you why
True famine
It's true to me
Like a fire it comes and goes
True famine
What we deny

I don't need you to gain
My confidence
Is it true what they say
Do I just feel the same?

All lies
On my lifetime
Death wish
Another high five
