Don't jump from the aeroplane
It's not your day
Hey, maybe you got some news for me
I don't want you to vanish and break
You need to pay, yeah you need to count it twice
Come back to the ground

Too much violence in your heart
You have turn, burn inside out
You're here to lose, yeah you cannot stop us all
So fuck you all
And let it burn, burn, yeah...
Light up the sky for me
Reason it out for me
Light up the sky for me
Reason it out for me

No means never
Let's talk about
We look the same
Just authorize
Walking denial
Within reason
Into the wind of fire
Into the wind that I've made

You need to give another chance to me
You need to give another chance hey
