Another ordinary day
I saw something new
I remember watching far away
And you had it all

I know it's not the same
When I throw it out again
I gave my love to you

It's not as easy as it seems
Build it on the dreams
Love takes, always needs some one to blame

Any kind of truth
For me they're all the same
My story ends to you
In flames
It's easy just to believe
Not without a feel
Right or wrong my love
In flames
