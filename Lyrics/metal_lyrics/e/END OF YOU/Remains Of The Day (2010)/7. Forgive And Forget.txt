My mind ain't sharp
I have no heart
My love ain't pure
My hands are rough
I can't let it shine
I keep it dark
My flowers won't bloom
But you know what

I feel your love
When it's not all right
I hear your call
When it really counts
I make it all right
When it falls apart
When you can't stop
Yeah
I will be there you know

I'm alone
I don't know
When and where we go
Look at me
You will know
We're not meant to be free
I don't know where we go
When you get to me
Together we will be ruling the world
Together we will be ruling the world
Don't give up
Without fight
It will be alright
You and I

I can't keep still
I don't care about
Sharing my pain to the world outside
I wonder how it feels
To fear the most
Overcome your pain
And feel no shame

I feel your love
When it's not all right
I hear your call
When it really counts
I make it all right
When it falls apart
When you can't stop
Yeah
I will be there you know
