Sense of you
End of you
Defining you
Center of you
Perfect moment
Just before the rain

Say it

Rays of light
Burning dust
Above and beyond
Unconnected
Fields of silence
This is the end of the world

Say it

Reach for the stars
End of the world
Until you hear
No more
Reach for the stars
Crash to the moon
Until you hear
No more

Sense of you
Sense of me
Time to say to you
I'm on my dream flight
I'm on my way to the moon
Time to feel what no one else could
I want to realize
