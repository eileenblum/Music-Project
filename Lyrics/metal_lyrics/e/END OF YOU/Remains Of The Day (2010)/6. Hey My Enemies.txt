Speak your mind
Or show your smile
They won't understand
They can't have you both
Like I nail you down
Come on show me
Let it shine for me
You have to pay
Taxes for the heart of the land

Hey you hey
My enemies
You know I can't stay up here
It's not why I'm fighting for
It's in your memories
No one can stop me now
You all want to shoot me down
But I get stronger every day
I can't stop now

You can't turn me around
But hear me out
Tell no one
Do what you've been told
Keep it down
Low profile
