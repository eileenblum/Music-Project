If all you know Is that I will rip us apart to save our lives
Would you believe that I'm no fool when I escape

When I derail you know I've done this before
One more try
But you ain't here to light my way
You turn me into this

Hold me back
No one cares about
Whole impact
Time is running out
Pull us through
I will burn tonight
We come as one

If all you know
Is that I've done this before
Million times
But you ain't here
to light my way
You turn me into this

When all comes to an end
Wait before the sign
Time to realize
Why you leave us all
Take your time
It's worth waiting for
On the run
When there's no hope
Let's make it last forever
