Standing by
In line
Another job
For real
If you could make
One deal
Choice is yours
All real
It leaves you cold
Like I
...and all your luggage
Don't deny
If I could die
Now is the time
I told you so
I told you why

One need and fear to lose my mind
I told you so
This ain't for me
I want to yell
No more
My dreams will take one step too far
They disappear
This ain't for me
I want to yell
No more

Waiting while
You define
What I'm I to you
Stepping on 45
Another look
Through you
Like a film
Without a sound
Black and white
Unconnected
If I could die
Now is the time
I told you so
I told you why

This ain't your life
Praise you hold inside
One step too far
You tell yourself you are
