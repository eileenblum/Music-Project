This ain't no me
I need to compromise
I want a better god
You don't have time for me
I guess I'm fucked
Something here
Reminds of you
You had to leave
You don't want to be
Involved
Tell me
Make a call
How real?
Talk about
Way back then
Are you
Satisfied
We are all against you
And yes I know
You gotta be crucified
To be a man
Whatta hell, I give it a shot anyway
Beliefs
Dead silence
Before the haze disappears
Turns to my sun
Decisions to make
And even now
You're stuck with me
Thinking times
Time way back then
But then again
What would you change
Everything seems to be so damn unfair
Wouldn't you get lost with your fight?
Wouldn't you be lost with your ghosts?
You gotta be crucified
To be a man
Whatta hell, I give it a shot anyway
Beliefs
Dead silence
Before the haze disappears
Turns to my sun
Be crucified
We are losing too much
What else can I do?
Beliefs
Dead silence
Before the haze disappears
Turns to my sun
