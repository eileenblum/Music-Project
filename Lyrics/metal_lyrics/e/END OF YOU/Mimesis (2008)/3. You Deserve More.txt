Feed my needs
Behind the scenes
Everybody's watching
Cos' I gotta be
I gotta be all that you cannot heal
I gotta
Gold relieves
I am it all
Until it's gone
Forsaken
I'd kill for the thrill
I am alive and it's time to tell you
I feed you
White lies, white lies
Oh, you gotta
Say no, say no
When it comes down to me
It might just save you in time
Real lies, real lies
Oh, you gotta
Say no, no more
When it comes down to this
It might just save us in time
