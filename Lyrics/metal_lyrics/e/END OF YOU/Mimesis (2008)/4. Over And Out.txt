Guilty and done
Suffering with pride
Handshake with gun
Endless fight for survival
Crushing with style
War is on our side
So this one is for real
It's your business
I'm in this for you
There's gotta be another way
No matter what they say
Rejoin front-line
Roam throughout your mind
Take a look around
Fragments of what used to be
Crushing with style
War is on our side
So this one is for real
It's your business
I'm in this for you
There's gotta be another way
No matter what they say
Just long enough to make it hurt
No cure to make it work
Until I drown
And while the world goes by
A Flash in front of my eyes
Over and out
Over and out
Over and out
Justify
