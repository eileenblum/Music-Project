My time has come to the end
Why won't you let me go?
I don't trust you, not anymore
Just that little man in my mirror
I don't care, I don't want,
I won't pray
I don't need anything
So why the hell you won't
Leave me to be?
Today I'm going to die
Today I won't get you
out of my mind
My friend, you don't fool me
You do what you think is right
It happens all the time
What can it be, what else
will come?
I don't care, I don't want,
I won't pray
I don't need anything
So why the hell you won't
Leave me to be?
