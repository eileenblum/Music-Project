I wanted to be real
Like my enemies
I wanted to believe
Stories to be told
Would you change my world?
Under blood red sky
It has been too long
Don't know reason why

All dreams are made of lies
Faith no
No more
In divine intervention
Betray your kings in disguise
The troops of violence
Will kill the silence in me
If you were mine to give
Why would you live in fear?
You never came to me
I needed you to say no
I was raised to fear
In my uniform
Would you lie for me?
Could you do it for me?
