Rhythm got you in
but can you ease the pain?
Move against
Is it worth writing about now?
Furthermore your hate is getting cold,
too old
What was it all about?
This is a draw until
we start another round
I've been told it's not that wise
to trust your soul
Every bone
Those fools who they they've got it right
Troubled glance behind the wall
Days in the past
Days to come
You could use some words of wisdom
Careless as I am
I'm living without you
Sleeping with lights on
I'd rather be dead
Careless as I am
I'm living without you
Sleeping without you
Rhythm got you in
but can you ease the pain?
Furthermore your hate is getting cold,
too old
Heads up high
Goodbye, farewell
Heads up high
We will never die
Goodbye, farewell
Hopes forever blind
Goodbye, farewell
We will never die
