Nothing more to say
I keep waiting
Same old feeling
Heard it all before
I can't change it
I will never get it right
Never get it right
Whole lot of words
Keep coming back to me
Keeping me insane
Am I one to blame?
I can't believe I don't hear
the words anymore
They will never be the same
Never be the same
How does it feel to be unreal?
I know for sure
What else could I be?
Wanting more
Losing it all
Against the rain
I need little time
In the void
Blinded by hate
I've been living in a lie
Working like a slave
Still keeping hope alive
Paying for my sins
With the uttermost price
I will never be the same
Never be the same
