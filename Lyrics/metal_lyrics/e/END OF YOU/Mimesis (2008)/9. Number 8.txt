Overdose, kind of close
My hate starts to heal
Nothing removes this empty whole
Clearness what I feel
Every second everywhere hurts
Time is just too sharp
No matter how I try
I can't stop the time
Every second everywhere hurts
Time is just too sharp
It's all up to you
Time will come when you'll be afraid
and you don't know why
It's all up to you
Time will come when you'll be afraid
but no, you just can't hide
I've seen it all, all the forms
Shadow of the sun
I'm not the man I used to be
Shadow, what will come?
Every second everywhere hurts
Time is just too sharp
