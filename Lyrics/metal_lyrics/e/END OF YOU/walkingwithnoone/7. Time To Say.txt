I feel I'm live
I can't say I've tried
In my dreams I'm going a head
I seek I find
I open my eyes
I feel I'm lonely again

I won't make the same mistake again
Time to make it
Time to say

Things to say
My name is gone
I feel I'm going away
My fight my rest
I need no hope
I feel I'm falling again

I won't make the same mistakes
Ages and ages waiting
Truth is this is a lie
I will do I will go
Anything I try to do
Anywhere I want to go
They will find me
They won't leave
Do I really want to be alone?
