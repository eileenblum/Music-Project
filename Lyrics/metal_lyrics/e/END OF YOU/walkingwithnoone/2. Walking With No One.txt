This time I know what I feel
And why it's happening to me
If I forget everything
It's okay because I do it for me
I give you time, I give you space
What more do you want from me?
If I do what I like, why won't you do the same?

[chorus]
Come and walk with my eyes
Come and walk to my life
If there is nothing to me
I cannot get everything
I give what is already in there
If there is nothing below
How do I know what I miss?
What more do you want from me?

This time I know what I feel
And why it's happening to me
If I forget everything
It's okay because I do it for me
I give you all what there's to take
How long it lasts before I fall?
Is it real what you fear?
Is it me or you to hate?

If there ain't nothing below
How would you know what is already in there
If there ain't nothing to me
How would you know, what more do you want from me
