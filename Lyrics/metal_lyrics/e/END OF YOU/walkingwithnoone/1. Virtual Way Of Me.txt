Everything I see
Seems to be unreal
My imagination
Draws pictures in my head
What is real, or can it be...

Strange colours in my eyes
Strange thoughts in my mind
When I touch you, you will know whoâs unreal

[Chorus]
No crime
No escape
No reason to take
I have
What is mine?
But this ainât real
So whoâs to blame?
Every day I feel
But I canât touch your face
In my sweetest dream
Where you belong to meâ¦

Voices in my head
Far away from my life
Coming up to real
I just want to leave, but canât
I cannot hide, I cannot leaveâ¦

Strange colours in my eyes
Strange thoughts in my mind
When I touch you, you will know whoâs unreal

[Chorus]
No crime
No escape
No reason to take
I have
What is mine?
But this ainât real
So whoâs to blame?
Every day I feel
But I canât touch your face
In my sweetest dream
Where you belong to meâ¦
Virtual way of meâ¦
Itâs coming up to realâ¦

Strange thoughts in my mind
Strange colours in my eyes
(Virtual way of me)
