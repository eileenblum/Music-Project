I have to fall to say
I have to fall all the way
I can't take the blame anymore.
I'm not here on my own.
If something can go wrong
It does, it will.again.

Silent all these days.
Silent all the way.

I don't know how long
I have been in my cage
I used to count
Not anymore.
Night changes to a day
Another year in this way
And I know my days are done.

Silent all these days.
Silent all the way.

[chorus]
I will find my way
Make it to the surface
But it's not the same.
I won't betray you
This is my cross
My burden, my flame...
