I have this feeling, I'm getting lost again
Isn't there a way to get this day to it's end
(this day I know it will be the same again)
I'm too scared of running away from my life
I'm too tired, nothing makes sense anymore

And I... can't stand the way things are
And I... won't let it be

[chorus]
The end is getting closer
Little dreams are fading
Don't ya see the wounds in
my fragile skin
This pain cannot come inside
Why do we have to make it our own
I can't afford to make another mistake,
or do I?

Finally I'm in the corner
You cannot see the smile in my eyes

And I... can't stand the way things are
And I... won't let it be

[chorus]
The end is getting closer
Little dreams are fading
Don't ya see the wounds in
my fragile skin
This pain cannot come inside
Why do we have to make it our own
I can't afford to make another mistake,
or do I?

Questions about life make me wonder
Nonstop highway flashing through my windows
If I just could find the way
Place no one knows and what I want to be

[chorus]
The end is getting closer
Little dreams are fading
Don't ya see the wounds in
my fragile skin
This pain cannot come inside
Why do we have to make it our own
I can't afford to make another mistake,
or do I?
