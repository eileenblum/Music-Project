Hopeless clouded eyes conceal
The faintest flicker of fear
Sporting the newest plague
A life enduring travesty
Up to your ears in shit
You were born in a cage
You will die in a cage
Tortured and imprisoned in the worse of conditions
Desecration of nature and logistic rape
Wrongly brought into this world
Never to see the light
A vermin's plight
