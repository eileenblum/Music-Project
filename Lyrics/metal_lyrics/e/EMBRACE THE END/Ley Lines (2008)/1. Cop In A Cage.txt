Swallow dead drink oblivion
The end resonate disastrous surrender
No one likes to be the bearer of bad news
But it's time to put this old girl down
Our frames are riddled with holes
No big loss by friendly fire
Sew your seeds in the coffin
Breed us foreign cuddle time dancers
Bottoms up to cruel examples
Here's to the times
Here's to an epic failure
Now take swift flight
Aboard chariots in the sky
We'll put the powder in our guns
And take aim while our faces go numb
The studious courtship of cold steel on flesh
Zealots on rooftops will always shoot you down
So light up the night
Traffic is at a standstill
We're laughing in the face of imminent death
Flaunting our riches to the destitute
The power lines hang too low around here
Hanging their corpses from the overpasses
We're dancing on the teeth of a bear trap
The power lines hang too low around here
Cup our hands against the murky window
Eyes as wide as the sea
In eager hopes of catching a glimpse
Watching the lord undress
