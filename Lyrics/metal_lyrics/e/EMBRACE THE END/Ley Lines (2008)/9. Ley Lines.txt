This year the harvest was washed away
Borne on the back of a black water water wave
Drown the eastern seaboard and lap at the southern plains
All in all it's a hell of a day to ride the high horse down the straight and narrow
To deliverance
I can harness the cosmos in the palm of my hand
Bring the earth to a grinding halt by single silent command
Lay the mountains asunder, turn oceans to dry land
I've found the key that unlocks the shackles of gravity
Stones are floating overhead suspended in perfect symmetry
And the stones they sing to me...whisper soaring melodies
Accept this offering. For the past to be buried. Sustained by longing
Breathe your life into me and cure my disease
Open the window. The center of your chest
Take an axe to the glass. Find a friend and hide
I've built a home for my sweet across the brooding sea
Every cut that I made, I thought of your face
And every stone that was laid made your image cease to fade
But alas I am scorned. Hereby sentenced henceforth to wander
In empty castles
Body is a device to calculate
Soul is the earth trodden under our feet
Mind is the beauty begging to be raped
God is a child tugging on the shirt tails of fate
The snake is charming us
Our voices will ring from skyscrapers down the ley lines
And carry out to sea
Accept this offering
