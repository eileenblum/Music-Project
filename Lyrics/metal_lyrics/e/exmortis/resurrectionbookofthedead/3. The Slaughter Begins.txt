Revealing the blood that stains my hands
Preserving the thoughts which once made us man
A vengeance inside to destroy all I touch
The slaughter begins the blood shall I lust

The slaughter has begun

Visions of a dark land center of reality
Morbid enjoyment of the flesh
Visionary of the ancient ones
Existing on a higher plane of existence
Ascended to a momentary lapse of time
Immortal souls take your hands as I touch

The blood of the slaughter fulfills me

All innocence wil die by my hands
As I ravage through and prevail this land
Tangled in gore I must now feast
On the flesh that ties me to beneath

Everlasting pain the beauty I adore

Virulent rage take control of me
Forever enslaved as you soon shall be
You must meet your end as I destroy your soul
I feed on your flesh and devour you whole

Exmortis your maker the slaughter begins
