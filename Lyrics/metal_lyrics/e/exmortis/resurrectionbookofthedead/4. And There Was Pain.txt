Maniacal butcher undeniable pain
Forsaken sanity torment and strain
Visible torture chopped up remains
A twinge of death life's end game
The ancient mind knows not of pain
Strewn bodies down upon the floor
Morbid enjoyment of the flesh
Soulless rage stench of death

Oceans of death writhing with pain
Horrible victims arise
Scorching the earth the ancients survived
And there was pain

Rotten air from from the black walls of sin
Decimate beware of the horrors within 
Unnatural birth I take your only child
Convert to ascend blood soaked and piled
Fortunate ones learn the stench of my land

Oceans of death writhing with pain
Horrible victims arise
Scorching the earth the ancients survived
And there was pain

Inferior existence your blood I now crave
Bring one to me to make it my slave
Spawn of an ancient one now it shall be
A new god for taken this shall I see
Mankind's eternal hatred lust and greed
I may not have awoken if they had not planted my seed

Oceans of death writhing with pain
Horrible victims arise
Scorching the earth the ancients survived
And there was pain
