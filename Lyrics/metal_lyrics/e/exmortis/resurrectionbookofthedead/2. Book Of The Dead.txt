Evil one a man of respect
Trusted to prepare the dead
Unknowing victims reserve their space
Empty crypts for the human race
Selling bodies to the underground
For their flesh and their bloody games
Eternal nightmare written in blood
The book foretold us all

Written in blood, bound by flesh
The book of the dead

Exmortis the ancients have arrived
Exmortis seal your final cry

A cry of death I sear your bones
Scared as you prepare to die
Forbidden pleasures confessed to me
Violence to take the throne
Aborted nightmare becomes reality
Beginning induced insanity
Tear your flesh a fesat for my hounds
Darkness of night no more can I count

Written in blood, bound by flesh
The book of the dead

Exmortis the ancients have arrived
Exmortis seal your final cry

Your death is here as I slash your throat
Blood dripping from my claws
For what you seek for craft be found
The ancients reserve it all
Enchantment turns to silence
Insurgence turns to violence

Written in blood, bound by flesh
The book of the dead

Exmortis the ancients have arrived
Exmortis seal your final cry
