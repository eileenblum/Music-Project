A beaconing call deep within
The ancients rule horrors and sin
Wretched agony controlled insanity
This curse has spawned such humanity
Creatures of darkness start to swarm
Racing thoughts blood tastes so warm

Blade is sharp
Veins pulsate
Wretched anger
Deep red

Underground is the safest place
Frustrated are the human race
New borns lye awakening of sin
Spend a life to battle and win
Starving in fear search for food
Blown apart limbs prepare the wound

Blade is sharp
Veins pulsate
Wretched anger
Deep red

Forceful nightmare begins to come
Eventual horror we live in such scum
A burden is felt to rise above
And take the turn as others have done
Cut my veins the darkness I feel
Forbidden thoughts it's god's will

Blade is sharp
Veins pulsate
Wretched anger
Deep red
