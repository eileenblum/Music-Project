Twilight of the old age
Post mortem report
Bacteria not contained
Slaughterhouse step inside
Torrential bloodbath
Stalking death in pride
Your death is now complete
As you're forced through agony again

Frustration and hatred
Contaminate my view
Dreaming my mind is in silence
As insanity prevails my every move

Fade from reality

Such pain interminable suffering
I remember the rain storm coming
The shadows of the clouds racing
Like the thoughts in my mind

Fade from reality

Such pain interminable suffering
I remember the rain storm coming
The shadows of the clouds racing
Like the thoughts in my mind

[Lead: Brian Werking]

And I remembered blood and agony
Screaming at me like a chorus of the damned

Dreaming my mind is in silence
As insanity prevails my every move
My view is losing focus
A haze of reality slowly fades
Awoken to this hell
My souls release only a matter of days
