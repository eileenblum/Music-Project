World in torment split by agony
Cries from the grave mock our destiny
Nightmare under the curse of Cain
Darkness beckons nothing remains

Mental seizure of your morbid dreams
Life of blood fatal screams
Fragmented thoughts run through your mind
Annihilation is it real this time

Pathogenic silence the dead no longer proud
Over this earth descends a silent shroud

Paralysis of control signs begin to show
Fed by floods of hate evil seed starts to grow

Hidden end now revealed
The dead ascend can it be real
Minds possessed no facades
The dark descends reality fades

Pillar of fire see the evil light
Rebirth in flame the dead await for life

Rotten stench enters my head
Maggots squirm wait to be fed
The decayed corpse ripped apart
Consume the flesh plague of the dark arts

Herald the beast in it's unearthly name
This world devoured by darkness and flame
Terminal rage tensions overload
Stricken by fear society corrodes

Pathogenic silence the world will surely die
Over this earth revealed a silenced life

Shower of blood dead lie in the streets
Holy war millions sacrificed in defeat

Run but you know it will not end
Watch from the depths the dead ascend
Undead demons burst through the gates
The last battle mankind seals his fate

World in torment split by agony
Cries from the grave mock our destiny
Nightmare under the curse of Cain

Mental seizure of your morbid dreams
Life of blood fatal screams
Fragmented thoughts run through your mind
Annihilation is it real this time

Pathogenic silence the dead no longer proud
Over this earth descends a silent shroud

Paralysis of control signs begin to show
Fed by floods of hate evil seed starts to grow

Hidden end now revealed
The dead ascend can it be real
Minds possessed no facades
The dark descends reality fades

Straight from heaven the angels cry in pain
For the torture has been done
Pathogenic silence
