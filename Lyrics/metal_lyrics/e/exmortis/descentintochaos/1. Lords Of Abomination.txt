Darkness awaits to capture your last breath
Eternity's empty space echoes your fatal caress

Ancient being of eternal damnation
Screaming souls are summoned from the north

Resurrect the forgotten horrors of our past
Into the unhallowed grave the desecration is cast
Throne of blood endlessly dripping it's confession
Lords of abomination await their succession

Vanquished souls eagerly await to return
Evil wind smell the dead rotten as they burn
Into the dark waters of your future you will pear
Shadows of hate reflecting your fate

Blood upon the darkened cross behold the seventh sign
The powers arise from the mist vengeance will be mine

Delivering unto mankind the unholiest of hells
Unearthly creation turns to dust the putrid smell

[Lead: Brian Werking]

Beyond eternity see them as they reign
Evil spirits forever enslaved

Vanquished souls eagerly await to return
Evil wind smell the dead rotten as they burn

[Lead: Brian Werking]

Morbid pleasure right to live cruelly denied
Summoned for slaughter now they die

Darkness awaits to capture your last breath
Eternity's empty space echoes your fatal caress

Shattered existence soon all will be gone
Lords of abomination dead by dawn
