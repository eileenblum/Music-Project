Ripped apart commence to die
Torn body left to lie
Death comes to you now
Fade away without a sound
Tearing flesh ripping skin
Casual killing the slaughter begins

Another body another town
Rotting corpses underground

Blade slashes through the night
Found upon this bloody site
Limbs strewn head over there
Decomposed body rotten air

Autopsy complete funeral now
Maniacal butcher in the crowd

Curse of hell awakes
Eternal nightmare he creates
Signals from beyond
Carcass floating on the pond
Death comes to you now
Fade away without a sound
Tearing flesh ripping skin
Casual killing the slaughter begins

[Lead: Brian Werking]

Ripped apart commence to die
Torn body left to lie
Death comes to you now
Fade away without a sound
