Just woke up in here,
Nightmares in my head.
No one can help us now.
What have we done?
New hell we have made.
None of you deserve
What you really have.

Waiting for justice,
(to) be my guide.
Please forgive me
For what I am going to do.

Justice will knock
On everyone's door.
Now your time has come,
You will die all alone.
(I) want to see the suffering
Of human kind.
I don't mind to die,
All of you (are) going to die.
Going to die.

This has just begun,
I'm the hand of god.
His rage will blow you
Away from the earth.

Waiting for justice,
(to) be my guide.
Please forgive me
For what I am going to do

Justice will knock
On everyone's door.
Now your time has come,
You will die all alone.
(I) want to see the suffering
Of human kind.
I don't mind to die,
All of you (are) going to die.
Going to die!

Waiting for justice,
(to) be my guide.
Please forgive me
For what I am going to do.

Justice will knock
On everyone's door.
Now your time has come,
You will die...
(I) want to see the suffering
Of human kind.
I don't mind to die,
All of you (are) going to

Justice will knock
On everyone's door.
Now your time has come,
You will die...
(I) want to see the suffering
Of human kind.
I don't mind to die
I'll kill you all!
