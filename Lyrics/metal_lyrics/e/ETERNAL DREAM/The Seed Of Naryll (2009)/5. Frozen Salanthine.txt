Look back, fear her,
The goddess of frost of our homeland.
Why did we forget? Why did we sin our souls?
For us it's now too late.

I close my eyes,
Feel the pain inside.
Feel my head explode,
In hell you will all go.
No more tears to give,
You froze my soul
Broken but unbeaten,
My curse falls on you all.

A god watches
Life gone through his eyes.
He knew that this would come.
Someone has to stop her.

I'm the god of fire,
I know what you've done.
Won't be here to tolerate,
Neither kill 'em all.
I can't stop my anger,
This world doesn't belong to you.
If you can't stop your wrath, then I will.

Goddess Salanthine!
Goddess Of Sadness!
Freezing Our Hearts
Until We Fall In Madness!
As The Echoing Doom
Is Mirrored In Our Eyes
The Light Fades Away And
We'll Die In Despair!

The sight of cold,
The curse will claim us all.
But God from the suns
Will not allow her,
Even if it means she must die.

Who are you to say,
That I cannot destroy?
I do what my heart says,
Disagree and you'll die.
I'll fight you here,
In my land of Naryll
If you won't back down,
Prepare for war.

Goddess Salanthine!
Goddess Of Sadness!
Freezing Our Hearts
Until We Fall In Madness!
As The Echoing Doom
Is Mirrored In Our Eyes
The Light Fades Away And
We'll Die In Despair!
