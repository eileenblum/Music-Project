Here it all began,
In the lost forgotten lands of Naryll.
One girl, one mission,
To end the tyranny of the land.
For a reason,
She was chosen to be the saviour
Save from the end,
Before they say set me free.
Set me free.
Set me free!

Before they say,
Before they shout:
Set me free!

From the ashes you will see my name,
Stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
Brought to you to kill screams.
Heaven's red on this black day,
Light will bring life on this world.
Thee won't live, demon's lies,
You will live,
You won't die.

When they confronted,
She could see his heart was full of evil.
Turning into light,
Into the essence of the magic .
Power she'll rise and
Defeat forces from all hell.
And destroy tyranny.
A god is born.
A tyrant torn.
Into thorns!

Daughter of light,
Stands with no fear.
Saves from Death!

From the ashes you will see my name,
Stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
Brought to you to kill screams.
Heaven's red on this black day,
Light will bring life on this world.
Thee won't live, demon's lies,
You will live,
You won't die.

One of the gods,
Brings all justice.
Save us all!

From the ashes you will see my name,
Stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
Brought to you to kill screams.
Heaven's red on this black day,
Light will bring life on this world.
Thee won't live, demon's lies;
You will live

From the ashes you will see my name,
Stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
Brought to you to kill screams.
Heaven's red on this black day,
Light will bring life on this world.
End has come, checkmate done.
One more god among the stars.
