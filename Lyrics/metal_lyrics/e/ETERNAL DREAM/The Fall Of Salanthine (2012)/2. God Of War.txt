The third one born from light
To save humanity from the dark lands of dementia
Call out for him, pray for Percival
Without fear, ready to kill
Fearfull kid arise, you shall not battle the dark alone
Youâll have strength of a hellâs dog
Tales will be written for eternity
Fear shall rise when
The last one falls from a spell
A spell from the great evil
Forever you will live; you will live in our hearts
Our great god of war
In his last fight,
The darkness triumphs over the light
Our great hero poisoned
And return home to die
The last one falls from a spell
A spell from the great evil
Forever you will live; you will live in our hearts
Fear shall rise as
The last one falls from a spell
A spell from the great evil
Forever you will live; you will live in our hearts
Our great god of war
