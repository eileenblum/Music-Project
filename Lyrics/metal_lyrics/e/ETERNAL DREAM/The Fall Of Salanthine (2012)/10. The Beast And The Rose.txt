One night, full of gloom
We saw it appear in our dark homes
It arrived, it was there
To kill all of us, but it failed
When the beauty saw the beastâ¦
With the ugly beast she fell in love
she saw his eyes and her heart filled
Once he's seen her
their souls became united
Purity (and) Chastity bonded in one
as horror met innocence
Their love, while so wrong, was powerful
banished by all of the gods
Take me, have me, Iâm yours
but please spare my people, my kind
I donât, donât mind to leave
I feel my heart beating just for you now.
Take me, have me
let us go away
Instead of killing everyone of us
he spared our lives.
The angel of this town
took his broken heart
and he touched hers.
When the beast took the beauty,
the love transformed into magic
and pregnant she became that night.
With the ugly beast she fell in love,
she saw his eyes and her heart filled.
Once he's seen her their souls
could not be broken.
Purity (and) Chastity bonded in one,
as horror met innocence.
Their love, while so wrong, was powerful,
banished by all of the gods.
Purity (and) Chastity bonded in one,
as horror met innocence.
Their love, while so wrong,was powerful,
banished by all of the gods.
Banished by the godsâ¦
