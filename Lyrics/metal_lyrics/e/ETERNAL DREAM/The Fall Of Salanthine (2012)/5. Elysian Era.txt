Awake, heroes of all
Messiah of our hopes
Through mountains
Through oceans
Through the darkness
They will rise onto Naryll
Walking with the sky
Bringing the peace onto this earth
Changing our world
From dark into an Elysia
Elysian era, come forth to us, all of us
Through mountains
Through oceans
Through the darkness
They will rise onto Naryll
Walking with the sky
Bringing the peace onto this earth
Changing our world
From dark into an Elysia
Along the sky
Bringing the peace onto this earth
Changing our world
From dark into an Elysia
Through mountains
Through oceans
Through glaciers of darkness
They will awake onto Naryll
Walking with the sky
Bringing the peace onto this earth
Changing our world
From dark into an Elysia
Along the sky
Bringing the peace onto this earth
Changing our world
From dark into an Elysia
