Just woke up in here
Nightmares in my head
No one can help us now
What have we done?
New hell we have made
None of you deserve
What you really have
Waiting for justice,
(to) Be my guide.
Please forgive me
for what I am going to do
Justice will knock
On everyoneâs door.
Now your time has come,
you will die all alone.
(I) Want to see the suffering
Of human kind.
I donât mind to die
All of you (are) going to die.
Going to die.
This has just begun
Iâm the hand of god.
His rage will blow you
away from the earth
Waiting for justice
(to) Be my guide.
Please forgive me
For what I am going to do
Justice will knock
On everyoneâs door
Now your time has come
You will die all alone.
(I) Want to see the suffering
of human kind.
I donât mind to die
all of you (are) going to die
Waiting for justice
(to) Be my guide.
Please forgive me
For what I am going to do
Justice will knock
On everyoneâs door.
Now your time has come
You will die all alone.
(I) want to see the suffering
of human kind
I donât mind to die
all of you (are) going toâ¦
Justice will knock
On everyoneâs door
Now your time has come
You will die all alone
(I) Want to see the suffering
Of human kind
I donât mind to dieâ¦
Iâll kill you all!
