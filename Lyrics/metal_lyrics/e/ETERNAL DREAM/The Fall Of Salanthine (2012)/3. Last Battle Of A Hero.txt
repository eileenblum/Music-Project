Fighting alone, the fear of death is gone
I was sent, the last hope of a dying town
I was too late; they were all turned into stone
Demons appear, my sword cut the wind
And its head fell out
Defying death to clean the land
From seeds of evil, my final quest has come
Slay you all!
I am Percival, son of Rhed, invincible warrior
Here my sword, here my shield, knight of the king
Half an elf, half a god, guardian of justice
Challenge me and die by my steel
So one by one, the gorgons were all falling
I saw their lord, his hair; made out of snakes
He drew his axe, ran to me, the battle began
I am Percival, son of Rhed, invincible warrior
Here my sword, here my shield, knight of the king
Half an elf, half a god, guardian of justice
Challenge me and die by my steel
As my sword hits on his neck
My helmet fell out of my head
I fell into his magic trap
Fall with me into hell
I am Percival, son of Rhed, invincible warrior
Here my sword, here my shield, knight of the king
Half an elf, half a god, guardian of justice
Met my death in the battlefield
I am Percival, son of Rhed, invincible warrior
Here my sword, here my shield, knight of the king
Half an elf, half a god, guardian of justice
Met my death in the glory of battle
