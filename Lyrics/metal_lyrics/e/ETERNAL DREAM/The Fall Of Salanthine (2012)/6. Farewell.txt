Grass is greener no more
what is the reason of the death
the weakness of the strengh.
The light won't be brigther again
lake waters are rotten
theres is no life of wonders.
And I will close my eyes
when you ear the cry of souls
I will be there.
Red flow release me
where blood laments seems to dwell.
Trapped in a see of pain.
Frost heart turned into stone
joy in sadness forever lost.
I will close my eyes
when you ear the cry of souls
I will be there.
Red flow release me
where blood laments seems to dwell.
And I will close my eyes
when you ear the cry of souls
I will be there.
Red flow release me
where blood laments dwell
and I will close my eyes
when you ear the cry of souls
I will be there.
Red flow release me
where blood laments seems to dwell.
Lied while darkness embrace me
never trusted in the wheels of life.
Last drop of blood be spilled
togheter we will rest as soon as I die.
