Look back, fear her
The goddess of frost of our homeland
Why did we forget? Why did we sin our souls?
For us it's now too late
I close my eyes
Feel the pain inside
Feel my head explode
In hell you will all go
No more tears to give
You froze my soul
Broken but unbeaten
My curse falls on you all
A god watches
Life gone through his eyes
He knew that this would come.
Someone has to stop her.
I'm the god of fire
I know what you've done
Won't be here to tolerate
Neither kill'em all
I can't stop my anger
This world doesn't belong to you
If you can't stop your wrath, then I will
Goddess Salanthine!
Goddess of Sadness!
Freezing our souls
Until we fall in madness
As the Echoing Doom
Is mirrored in our eyes
The light fades away and
We'll die in dispair!
The sight of cold
The curse will claim us all
But God from the suns
Will not allow her
Even if it means she must die.
Who are you to say
That I cannot destroy?
I do what my heart says
Disagree and you'll die
I'll fight you here
in my land of Naryll
If you won't back down
Prepare for war
Goddess Salanthine!
Goddess of Sadness!
Freezing our souls
Until we fall in madness
As the Echoing Doom
Is mirrored in our eyes
The light fades away and
We'll die in dispair!
