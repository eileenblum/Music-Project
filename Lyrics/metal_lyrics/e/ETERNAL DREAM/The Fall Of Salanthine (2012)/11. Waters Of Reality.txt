One night I dream,
one night I see,
the way which I would like to be.
No more in this world,
forgotten in vain.
The way I want all things to flow.
No more to turn back,
forgotten no more. I am,
I wish, to stay asleep.
The world around me,
the pains to go through.
To be swimming in Waters of Reality.
I may be a wolf.
I may be a king.
Everything but me.
I shouldn't exist,
lost here in between
all my hundred worlds.
Dreams to live,
lights to see,
heroes to be,
castles to own,
treasures for me,
Welcome to my World.
One night I dream,
one night I see,
the way which I would like to be.
No more in this world,
forgotten in vain.
The way I want all things to flow.
No more to turn back,
forgotten no more. I am,
I wish, to stay asleep.
The world around me,
the pains to go through.
To be swimming in Waters of Reality.
Flying through the sky,
crossing the blue seas,
to never seen lands.
Rainbow fields of peace,
who won't disappear
up until daylight.
Dreams to live,
lights to see,
heroes to be,
castles to own,
treasures for me,
Welcome to my World.
One night I dream,
one night I see,
the way which I would like to be.
No more in this world,
forgotten in vain.
The way I want all things to flow.
No more to turn back,
forgotten no more. I am,
I wish, to stay asleep.
The world around me,
the pains to go through.
To be swimming in Waters of Reality.
