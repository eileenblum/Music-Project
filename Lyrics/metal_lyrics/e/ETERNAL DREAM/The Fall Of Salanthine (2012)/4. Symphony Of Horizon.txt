From the ashes you will see my name,
stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
brought to you to kill screams.
Heavenâs red on this black day
light will bring life on this world.
Thee wonât live, demonâs lies
you will live, you wonât die
Here it all began
in the lost forgotten lands of Naryll
One girl, one mission
to end the tyranny of the land
For a reason
she was chosen to be the saviour
save from the end,
before they say set me free.
Set me free. Set me free!
Before they say,
before they shout:
Set me free!
From the ashes you will see my name,
stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
brought to you to kill screams.
Heavenâs red on this black day,
light will bring life on this world.
Thee wonât live, demonâs lies;
you will live, you wonât die.
When they confronted,
she could see his heart was full of evil.
Turning into light,
Into the essence of the magic power
Sheâll rise and defeat
forces from all hell.
And destroy tyranny.
A god is born. A tyrant torn.
Into thorns!
Daughter of light,
stands with no fear.
Saves from Death!
From the ashes you will see my name,
stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
brought to you to kill screams.
Heavenâs red on this black day,
light will bring life on this world.
Thee wonât live, demonâs lies;
you will live, you wonât die.
One of the gods,
brings all justice.
Save us all!
From the ashes you will see my name,
stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
brought to you to kill screams.
Heavenâs red on this black day,
light will bring life on this world.
Thee wonât live, demonâs lies;
You will liveâ¦
From the ashes you will see my name,
stolen from my destiny.
Goddess of magic dreams,
brought to you to kill screams.
Heavenâs red on this black day,
light will bring life on this world.
End has come, checkmate done.
One more god among the stars.
