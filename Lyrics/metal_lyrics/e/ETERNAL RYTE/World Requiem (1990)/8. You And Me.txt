There I was, on my own. Just a lonely boy as I could be.
All alone in the world. No one there to care for me.

Then you called out to me.
"Come and put your trust in me."
Then you set me free.
Now I'm right beside you.
Within your arms in your love.

I'm on my way in your love. You and me!
Together forever, forever free.
There's no turning back from your heart. You and me!
You set me free.

Now I'm here in your arms. And I'm not afraid of what I feel.
Far away from the scars. I know this love is real.

Cause when I cried out to you.
You said to put your trust in me.
Then you set me free.
I'm right beside you.

Within your arms in your love.
I'm on my way in your love. Now it's you and me!
Together forever, forever free.
There's no turning back from your heart. Now it's you and me!
You set me free.

[Guitar Solo]

No scars, no pain.
You took them all away. You and me!
No fear, no shame.
You took it all away. You and me!
When you bid love to me.
I knew this love was real.
You and me! You and me! You and me! You and me!
