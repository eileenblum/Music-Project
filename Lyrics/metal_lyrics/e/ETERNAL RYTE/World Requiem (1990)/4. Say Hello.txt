You say hello like so many times before.
I turn and run away from you.
My heart was broke by a love that was unreal.
And as you whisper I can hear you say.

Stay, stay with me I hear you calling out.
But, I can't believe that love is real.
All of my life I've searched for love so true.
Tell me, can I take a chance on you?

You say hello like so many times before.
Say hello, when no one else would hear my cry.
Hello, hello, my heart is crying out.
Say hello, can I take a chance on love?
And say hello to you.

Now, I am here with my heart a mile wide.
Could you love me like you did before.
Now for so long, I've wanted love so true.
And all this time my heart was needing you.

You say hello like so many times before.
Say hello, when no one else would hear my cry.
Hello, hello, my heart is crying out.
Say hello, can I say hello to love?
And say hello to you.

[Guitar Solo]

You say hello like so many times before.
Say hello, when no one else would hear my cry.
Hello, hello, my heart is crying out.
Say hello, can I say hello to love?
Hello, hello, my heart is crying out.
Say hello, don't you see I need you so.
Hello, with love, my heart is crying out.
Say hello, I feel I need you so?

Forever now. You'll stay a friend of mine.
Forever. You'll stay by my side.
