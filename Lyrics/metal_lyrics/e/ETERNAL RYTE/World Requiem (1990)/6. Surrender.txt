Madness is on the streets again.
Apathy has seized the hearts of men.
Evil are the days upon the land.
Like the ... we seize ...

Gaze on the madness.
Don't close your eyes.

Surrender!
Salvation is at hand to captive hearts.
Surrender!
And don't be afraid ... of the dark.

Time bombs they tick away our days.
Terrorism strikes our deepest fears.
Madmen and tyrants rule the age.
Blindly, how the chosen turn away.

Gaze on the madness.
Don't close your eyes.

Surrender!
Salvation is at hand to captive hearts.
Surrender!
And don't be afraid ... of the dark.

[Guitar Solo]

Shackled to our walls of pride.
Hell bound captives to our own desire.
Cry out, the answers close at hand.
Will you choose the bondage or the lamb?

Gaze on the madness.
Don't close your eyes.

Surrender!
Salvation is at hand to captive hearts.
Surrender!
But don't be afraid ... of the dark.
