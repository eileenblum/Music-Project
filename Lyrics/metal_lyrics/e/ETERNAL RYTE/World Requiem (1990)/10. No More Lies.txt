You're walking tall you draw your sword out.
You strike your weaker brother down.
Won't shed a tear for the innocent.
Is that what your life's all about?
It's time to open your eyes and see.
The power of life.
The only bloodshed that does us right.
Is the blood of Jesus Christ.

No more! No more lies.
Open your eyes.
No more! No more lies.

Politicians and leaders.
Filled with slander and pride.
For two more votes I will mention Christ.
Hypocrite show him your life.
Kids run amuck in a world of hate.
And you drag them through the fire.
You call your grudges religious wars.
While the body count grows higher.

No more! No more lies.
Open your eyes.
No more! No more lies.

[Guitar Solo]

You say you just don't need a godly form.
You say you're doing all right.
Listen! Righteousness is like filthy rags.
It's trash in Jesus' sight.
It's time you open your eyes and see.
The power of life.
The only blood shed that does us right.
Is the blood of Jesus Christ.

No more! No more lies.
Open your eyes.
No more! No more lies.
No more! No more lies.
Open your eyes.
No more! No more lies.
No more lies, no more, no more, no more.
