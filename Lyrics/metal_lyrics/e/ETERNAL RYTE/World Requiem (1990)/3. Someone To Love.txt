Hey little boy playing in the street.
Where truth and terror collide.
Playing games no one else would dare to try.
Your toys are calling out to you.
Now you're the game.
Cold sweat, voices in your head.
You numb it with a lie.

There's got to be a better way.

In someone who loves you - loves you.
And someone who cries for you.

Hey little girl back in from the world.
They broke your heart in two.
All you wanted was someone to love you.
You gave your heart, they took it.
Oh, look what they've done to you.
When all you wanted was someone whose love would be true.

You've got to open up your heart.

To someone who loves you - loves you.
To someone who cries for you.

[Guitar Solo]

Hey Mr. Family man.
Tired of the rat race lie?
As social vices squeeze the life from you.
You look for security, the dollar takes a dive.
Cold sweat, voices in your head.
You numb it with a lie.

There's got to be a better way.

In someone who loves you - loves you.
And someone who cries for you.
Someone who loves you - loves you.
Someone who cries for you.
