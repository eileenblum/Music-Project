All eyes will see him, coming from the clouds.
The King of King's arriving, with a mighty shout.
And all will stand before him, upon his royal throne.
And every tongue confess he is lord, and every knee will bow.
Hey bride to be, yeah, get ready for your groom.
Your world's so cluttered up, you haven't left him any room.

He's the King!
Worship His Majesty.
The King of Kings!
Then you'll see.
His the King, the King of Kings.

We all live together, here on this old earth.
Don't you even revere him? Who will you serve?
Rebellion will be judged, the King can save your soul.
Don't throw it away boy, you'll reap as you've sown.
Double standard morals, fit your every need.
You're tightrope dancing, straight to hell.
All the while saying your free.

He's the King!
Worship His Majesty.
The King of Kings!
Then you'll see.
His the King, the King of Kings.

[Guitar Solo]

The King of Kings.
Hey bride to be, yeah, get ready for your groom.
Your world's so cluttered up, you haven't left him any room.
Want to whore around, until the wedding day?
But God will not be mocked, don't throw it all away.

He's the King.
The King of Kings, tonight.
Worship His Majesty.
The King, oh.
He's the King.
Worship His Majesty.
The King of Kings, can't you see he's the King of Kings.
The King of Kings. Bow down!
