The windows of the world, are open wide tonight.
Step through the open door, by heart you know the lines.

Well, there's one thing, you've got to know tonight.
Somebody loves you!

And he paid the price for you. On the line! On the line!
And to show his love was true. On the line! On the line!
So lay your heart down. On the line! On the line!
Give it up to him. On the line!

Vanity, all is vanity, in the world you see.
All, but the price he paid. Just for you, for you and me.

It's time you see.
Somebody cries for you.
Somebody loves you!

And he paid the price for you. On the line! On the line!
To show his love was true. On the line! On the line!
So lay your heart down. On the line! On the line!
Give it up to today. On the line!

[Guitar Solo]

He paid the price for you, on Calvary!
What greater proof of love, could you ever need? (None)

He paid the price, to set you free tonight.
âCause Jesus loves you!

And he paid the price for you. On the line! On the line!
To show his love was true. On the line! On the line!
So lay your heart down. On the line! On the line!
Give it up to today. On the line!
