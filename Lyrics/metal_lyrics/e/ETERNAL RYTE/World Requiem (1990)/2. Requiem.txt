Downtown, alleyways.
Where shattered men with broken dreams.
Live and die in torn brick buildings fade to black
Where junkie's cries and pusher's lies.
Echo through the streets tonight.
There where pimps and tricks decide the price of life.

Oh, oh, oh this is my world. Apathy and madness are its requiem.

Stand and shout! For the passing of the world.
Stand and shout! Its dying echoes call.
Stand and shout! For a nation far from God.
Stand and shout! Take a look at the writing on the wall.

Uptown, midnight.
Plastic smiles on mannequins.
Play the circus of the world elite.
Where movie stars and kings and queens.
Display themselves on magazines.
There where pomp and pretense hide the pain.

Oh, oh, oh this is my world. Apathy and madness are its requiem.

Stand and shout! For the passing of the world.
Stand and shout! Its dying echoes call.
Stand and shout! For a nation far from God.
Stand and shout! Take a look at the writing on the wall.

[Guitar Solo]

Sunday suburbs. Great white building stands alone.
Dead asleep like those who dwell inside.
Bless me Lord, now they cry.
While outside, scores of beggars cry.
Empty words, like epitaphs on tombs.

Oh, oh, oh this is my world. Apathy and madness are its requiem.

Stand and shout! For the passing of the world.
Stand and shout! Its dying echoes call.
Stand and shout! For a nation far from God.
Stand and shout! Take a look at the writing on the wall.
