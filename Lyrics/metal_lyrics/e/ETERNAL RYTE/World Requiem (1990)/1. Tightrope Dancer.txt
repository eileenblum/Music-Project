Nightfall, do you like the way it feels?
Does your heart begin to rise at sundown?
Does it make you cry to see the heartache?
When the city night takes another life.

Tightrope dancer up so high. Dancing high above it all.

You call it make believe, a fool believes in heaven.
But deep inside you know it's real.
I cry a masquerade, a fool denies a savior.
Your plastic laughter hides the pain.

Tightrope dancer up so high. Dancing high above it all.
I see you high above it all - tightrope dancer.
I see you as you start to fall - tightrope dancer.

[Guitar Solo]

You call this paradise, but will this last forever.
Cause life's a vapor gone in a flash.
Just like a jester in the king's court.
When the hammer falls, tell me will you stand.

Tightrope dancer up so high. Dancing high above it all.
I see you high above it all - tightrope dancer.
I see you as you start to fall - tightrope dancer.
Oh, tightrope dancer as you call - tightrope dancer.
Oh, he will hear you as you fall - tightrope dancer.
I see you high above it all - tightrope dancer.
