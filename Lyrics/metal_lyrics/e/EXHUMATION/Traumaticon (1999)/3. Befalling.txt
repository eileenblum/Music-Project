How it feels
when life is leaving you behind
and you're trying to catch up so hard.
How it feels when death is beside you
and you're trying to take our last beath.

We are flashes in the darkness
like pale morning stars
with their last trembling light
while the sun vanishes for ever
we are drems kept in vain

How it feels
when all the stars are falling down
and you're flying with to them
How it feels when you're all alone
and your heart is crying with pain.

Were dying every new morning
as if we'd never been were loosing ourselves
inside the greatness of infinity.
Were dying every new morning
as if we'd never been.

[Chorus:]
Were left for rough loneliness
stone upon our lives are befalling
our years bitter wisom into the unhealed time.

How it feels
when all the stars are falling down
and you're flying with to them
How it feels when you're all alone
and your heart is crying with pain.

Were dying every new morning
as if we'd never been
were loosing ourslebe
Were dying every new morning
as if we'd never been.

[Chorus:]
Were left for rough loneliness
stone upon our lives are befalling
through our years.
