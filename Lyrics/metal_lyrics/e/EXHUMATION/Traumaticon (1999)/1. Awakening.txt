Im thinking
That every day is the same like the day before.
Im growing to be a part of a unchosen world.
A rotten way of life
thats punishing my innocent soul
Im turning my face away
waiting for the mirror to brake

Like a dream
my years are passing in front of me
An outstanding feeling
which captured my destiny

My hope is buried
and seems to be forgotten into thhe past.
An endless fall
is changing my will to defeat my inner fears.
The are voices
awaking me from the lethargy.

Nostalgia brings my inside out
and feeds my body
with emotions of another life.

[Chorus:]
My eyes are staring the abyss
searching for a light behind the dark.
Into the sunlights shaft
the darkness is more deeper
My eyes are staring the abyss
searching for a light behind the dark.
Into the sunlights shaft
the awaking

As the stars are fading out
at the blackness of the sky
The end of my time is standing
right in front of me
challenging me to ignore it.

Nostalgia brings my inside out
and feeds my body
with emotions of another life.

[Chorus]
