The shades of the past
are evoked before me
like gnomes who demand
the eternal condemnation of my soul

Chains and hooks suppressed my thoughts
captivating the memories
which I could never erase

And you extend your aged hand
towards me to wipe away my
tears and agony

[Chorus:]
Songs of life who echo like
noises and burst from biblical torrents as my mind
is being squeezed relentlessly
I am now left blind un excruciating
pain as forvent daggers are being
driven into my eyes

The shades of the past
are evoked before me
like gnomes who demand
the eternal condemnation of my soul

[Chorus]
