Before I see my emptiness
let me feel let me touch the sky
in all my life I've lived loneliness
now I'm crying out to a god thats forsaken me.
Now I'm falling down like s star in the winter night
now I embrace my death at the end of my time.

When skies will be ready to accept my soul
and dreams seems to be the end
life will put me in her arms again
to creat the breath of tomorrow

[Chorus:]
I'm seeing a pale horizon
the path in the land of nowhere
the shining shadows
that dance in the moonlight
A pale horizon the paths of secrecy
the shining shadows the birth of a new star

At the end of my dream a light still remains
to enlave my existence
in this world that despises me.
At the end of my dream
no one sess me dying
my screams in the void
only death is here for me.

efore I see my emptiness
let me feel let me touch the sky
in all my life I've lived loneliness
now I'm crying out to a god thats forsaken me.

[Chorus]
