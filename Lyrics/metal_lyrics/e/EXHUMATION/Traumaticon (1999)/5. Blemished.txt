Fallen angel, dreamer angel
you've list your wings you're trying to live
while your faith is vanished in the dust
A cry from nowhere so empty, so cold
a strong illusion thats pulling your thoughts
in a false world.

Like a wish at the dawn of loneliness
in your haunted eyes visions are yout reality
and dreams are your endless hell.

Behind the darkness
there are secrets of forbidden worlds
forgotten sunsets in a circle of your lost dreams.
The stars are dying discoloring the sky
buring angel your shouldering fire
is curving inside your eyes.

[Chorus:]
Passing shapres of dark and light
frustrating your mind a blemished body
thats in defiance of the guilt.
Passing shapres of dark and light
frustrating your mind a blemished body

Faltered angel you're only fantasizing
a shiny tomorrow in which no one believes.

Like a wish at the dawn of loneliness
in your haunted eyes visions are yout reality
and dreams are your endless hell.

[Chorus]
