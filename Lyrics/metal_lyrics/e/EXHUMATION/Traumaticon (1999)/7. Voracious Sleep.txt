Night breath
lead me beyond this dream
through the stars, through the clouds.
Where my sins are hiding
in the icy wave of fear
there's a gray dimension of emptiness
whhere my tears are betrayed

Sacred soul
you're dying in atrang way
falling into void.
A denying sleep that's poisoned my entire life
in a black colored scenery.

I can feel the time around me
like the veils of a misty sea
Awakening my fate passing to unreal
there's a brand new age through the years.

[Chorus:]
The night seems so cold
and I can feel the tears in my eyes
like a heavy rain
stealing my ability to search for more
as a blank statue I accept my destiny

As the daylight comes
the unborn sun is knowcking on my dream
to arise my senses
but I'm falling deeper
into my voracions sleeps

Awakening my fate passing to unreal
there's a brand new age through the years.
A denying sleep that's poisoned my entire life
in a black colored scenery.

[Chorus]
