Walking on the lifeless time of mind
searching for dream drops
to harden the aura of my heart
my inner world is torn apart
In gray clouds of lies
in the sphere of illusion
wandering in the wind of desertion

I let myself to the waves of madness
that crucified my time in an ineffable chaos

[Chorus:]
The vultures of loneliness
are folding their wings
under a sun of despair.
Awakening the nightmares
thats bleeding fron the crown of life
The words are falling dead
as the nights rage is approaching
the sound of silence is perching
inside me drowning every breath of hate

You can feel me
you can see the future
od a world thats dying inside me.
Find the pieces
which are drowning
in the endless sea of time.

Walking on the lifeless time of mind
searching for dream drops
to harden the aura of my heart
my inner world is torn apart
I let myself to the waves of madness
that crucified my time in an ineffable chaos

[Chorus]
