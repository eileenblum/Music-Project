In deserted times the eyes are hovering
ripping the veils of life
Capturing the light reflectinc sedate waters
in the sphere of destiny
My life is flowing slowly scaring the wounded souls
which has been forgotten in the swirl of death

Comparing the abyss with dying
feeling the chaos in darkness.
Silver leaves are falling down
upon the empty heart.
That's unaware of the coming of death
which destroyed the sky I was looking at
changing night into day.
Endless fight of time with time

[Chorus:]
Every night is bringing
the silent of death and emptiness
like a distant echo of my deserted times.
Every brand new morning life becomes a denial
I dare to touch the sky with my wounded eyes

It's dawning for those
who have no todays and yesterdays
who only have tomorrow to live or die

[Chorus]
