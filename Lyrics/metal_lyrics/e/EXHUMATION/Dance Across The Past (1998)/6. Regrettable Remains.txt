Life is coming on me
like a breathless wind
scattering all my memories
of days in the spring sun
When the soft wind
was breaking lose from my thirsty hands
can 't stand this
springled sensation of life
which vanished all my dreams away
The howling in my mind
won't let me feel my life
that 's haunting my destiny
like death before my time
The night is walking on my way
leaving a glacial touch
like the endearment of the dead
extincting my untold feelings
Search somewhere in the sky a sign
that 's been forgotten
through the years
I 'm still a regrettable remain
of a failed world
