I can do you no harm
even though
I hide behind hatred
a child that's hurt followed the road
all little ghosts follow
Using the excuse
of a cruel world
a strange pleasure
in melancholy and horror
An empty body
washed shame away
indulging in the lust for evil
depending on the kindness of strangers
and the loving arms that smothered me
for I have sinned
and no regret can fail my presence
I can do you no harm
even though it has grown up
reminding me
the purpose of my life
the meaning of a sorrowful existence
A child that's hurt
can learn about the pain
a child that's hurt
can know how wonderful this is
