An isolated shadow
lying peacefully
on an endless heaven
a corrupted soullonging for immortality
a filthy mind
fed with delightful dreams
Players in a game
somehow I feel unable to get involved
Tender blue invests the scene
with a kind of lyricism
I try to find peace
within ancient rhymes that cry of anger
Needing auxiliary channels of life
shaping a visionary company of love
inviting you into my depression
Sadistic green
completes the atmosphere of decay
I won't find peace
in ancient rhymes that cry of anger
