Where is the meaning of life
in this unjustly wasted time
of lost ideas and dreams
in the hidden side of my life
I can see my unborn fear
that's consuming my only way out
to the light
beyond the gate of silence
Where is the meaning of life
at the empty angle of my eyes
was hovering the aura of death
is this my redemption
In the slender light of the day
my unsuspected existence
was whirling in a farrago
of an illusion
that slowly is killing my soul
Breaking the wall of loneliness
I faced a moment of truth
the quintessence of life
your biggest enemy is yourself
