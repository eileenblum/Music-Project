My eyes will meet yours
in a swirl of time
like a whisper in your dreams
I will fly there to die
I am the one
who's rolling through your tears
I am the passing thought
inside your untold fears
I am the one
who dances across the past
with my black heart
made of dust
The velvet night
was breathing on my soul
so lonely in my everlasting dream...
