Walking at the desert paths
feeling uncertain for tomorrow
my unexpected fears
are looking for my mind
Watching my life day by day
lost in empty pictures
trying to escape from monotony
misery unable to cry out for help
Reflections
are leading me to a heaven
I already lost
empty horizons are my visions
and this is where I can only be
far beyond the sky
I lay down my wings
till the clouds
will uncover the sun
When the moonless night
will come again feeling uncertain
walking in a desert path of my pain
the moonless night will come again
walking in the desert path of my pain
