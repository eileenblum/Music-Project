The uncreated thoughts
are crossing through your mind
divesting all your life
that's rolling through  your hands
You can't stop the time with your insane eyes
searching the unanswered whys
living in seclusion
denying what all the others had accepted
Don't invade into your dreams
penetrate your abyss
All your past is a dreamy recollection
It seems you're trapped in fear
and time is lost for you
you are two different pieces
in two different worlds
The clouds in your mind
are seeking for a perfect day
and your rainy eyes
just hopping for a look
You can't stop the time
but you can feel the wind
which is lying underneath your wings
You are a dreamer in desert
Hoping for the rain
you are two different pieces
in two different worlds
and you must carry on...
