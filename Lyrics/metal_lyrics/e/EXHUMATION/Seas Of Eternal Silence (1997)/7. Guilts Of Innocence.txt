As I'm altering tomorrow
all the bitter thoughts of the past
are mangling the unsuspected
shadow of time
deserting the unseen side of soul
My lost youth which I've spilled
for the open cup of life
The dreams I've had, forgotten deaths
are tearing apart my upset mind
As I stared the rainbow
while my life's slipping from my hands
the dark appears to the sky
bringing thoughts of the past
Releasing shadows Guilts of innocence
throwing away the memories of hate
starting up again in the mausoleum of life
hunting all the fantasies on an empty sky
Times that they're haunting
the inaccessible sights
refusing my existence
while they are living away
