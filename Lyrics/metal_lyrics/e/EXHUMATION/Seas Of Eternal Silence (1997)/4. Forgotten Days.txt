Fear drives me in the darkness
prayers propagate my fall
can you show me the distance
between my mind and soul
Remember the forgotten days
Now, while the dust of the stars
is dying with the end of times
Comprehend my bitterness
understand my fears
I wipe for my god
alone in the land of tears
Did you know?
Your Fall has been foretold
in days that stars began to cry
at nights that blood has filled the sky
and dying since a hope that's old.
Twisting around circles of faith
desperate skies
unholy winds are haunting the clouds
melting like ice
