Beyond the eyes of universe
where dreams seem to revive
and hopes, dead souls are scanning the sun
The conclusion of your soul is not real
seems like a dream,
it's not dead what lies forever
Falling from the edge of the sky
onto the stairs of misery
like a wave the pain approaches
screaming for eternal plunder
Sight has left a memory
of my whispering life
that choose to make me suffer
Fates don't let me drown
into this bottomless sea
which is called life
Let the breathless wind steel my mind
to a brand new morning
