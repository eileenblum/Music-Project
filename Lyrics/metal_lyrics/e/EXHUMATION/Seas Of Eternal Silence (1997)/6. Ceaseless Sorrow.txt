Upon the bloody altar of my tears
where all my dreams keep pilling up
I saw death torturing my soul
I saw my soul teared apart
Away, a nameless shadow
inundating my perpetual sleep
with their datestable bewailings
trying to recall my unconscious birth
A breath of life into the mouldly air
that diffuses my existence
an imposing voice that awakes
and erases all the apathy
Fire, a rotting race
all I see is a dying place
full of loneliness and pain
and my dreams are all in vain
Years are passing by
through my dark and velvet sky
isolation, ceaseless sorrow
makes me feel there's no tomorrow
