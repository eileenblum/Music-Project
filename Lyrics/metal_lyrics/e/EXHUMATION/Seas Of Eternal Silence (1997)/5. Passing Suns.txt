Like passing suns in a desperate world
I passed through life watching the time
getting so old
Plunge in an elusive dream
seeking lost, places of my dying past
chasing my fate into a dreary sky
windows of pain permit me to fly
Like the wanton thoughts of the wind
I want to follow the restless circle of the sun
I want to veil my face
behind the secret side of the moon
Hide, find your inner self
cry out for your lost sky
born again
another sign of the passing suns
Falling into infinity where I belong
dragging the time of my existence
