When the sun was setting down
to touch the ground
shadows took their way to eternity
Their eyes stared the emptiness
following invisible steps.
Hawling behind the malicious desertion
and the acceptance of death
Searching for a sign to admit the ending
of their conflict.
When the moon appeared on the cloudy sky
in between dreams and reality
a world was born from their tears
where the dark seemed so sad.
When they altered their cries
to an unchecked falling rain
As the fear petrified their hearts
Forever they knew they were doomed
by their own weakness
At the gates of the morning sun
that starts to shine
shadows were passing through
At the seas of eternal silence
the sense of devastation
deep in their uncanny corridors
they 're waiting for the dream
