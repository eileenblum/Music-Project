BURNED IN THE SCORCHING LAND
WHEN SOULS DEHYDRATED FROM A BIRTH
WOUNDS BLEEDING
CARNAGE FOR SURVIVAL ON EARTH
WITH SPELLS OF SATAN
I SUMMON THEE
WE SACRIFICE
THIS WORLD OF SHIT

LORDS OF DEATH DESCEND THE FIRES OF GLOWING HELL
ENDLESS PAIN CHRISTIOANS DEAD WITH SMASHED HEADS
HOLOCAUST UNCEASH THE BLOOD OF DEFORMED CORPSES

SUFFER WIND BURNS THEIR SOULS
BEHEAD THE HOLY ALL SACRED DECEASED
RIPPING APART THE BLESSED
ANGELS BLEEDING MAGGOTS THEM FEAST
SPLATTERED GUTS OF MONKS
INTERNAL EXTRACTION OF HALLOWED EVES
DISMEMBER HIS HOLY CORPSE
IMMOLATION FOR LORD BLACK ABYSS

DIE- CRUCIFIXION DECAPITATED [2]

PRINCE OF FLIES WE GIVE YOU CROWDED SACRIFICE
WITH MY DISGUST TO NAZARENE AND HOLY CHURCH
ALL CRUCIFIED WILL BE CREMATED FOR YOUR NAME

SMELL OF DECAING FLESHS
FOR THE SPACE OF THE ENDLESS WAYS
VULTHRES ARE MOANING HIGH
WHEN ANGELS OF DARKNESS FEEDING THE DEAD
DENIED INVERTED CROOS
MAGGOTS CRAWLING FROM THEIR HEADS
GODS DESECRATION LAWS YOU DIE WITH CROSS
AND BURN IN HELL
