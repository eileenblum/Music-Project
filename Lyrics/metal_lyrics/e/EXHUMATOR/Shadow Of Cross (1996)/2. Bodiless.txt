Suffer life - no escape
Deformed bodies. Eves that bleed
Left alone with there pain
Indifference breaks belief
Living without feelings
Blinded by unhuman being
Suffocation coming slow
Your visions becomes real
Rotting abscess of the corpse
Drives to insanity
Before their eyes hope is died
Deterioration grows
The life will soon be gone
Bodiless being in wasters becomes to spot
Blackening humanity
Abomination grows like pain
Falling into depth of mind
Brutal death leads to die
Deterioration grows
Incurable mutilation
The life will soon be gone
Prayers will help you now
You will newer die before you soul be dead
Damned from the birth
Rest the slipped hope in the labyrinths of mind
Legs, hands and face covered with rot
Silent scream is heard
Burning in the dark
Infected with death turning into gore
Fill the blackened Earth
With burial sites
