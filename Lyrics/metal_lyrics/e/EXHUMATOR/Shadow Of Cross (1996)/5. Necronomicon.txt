Summoning shinned from the light
Unholy ones feasting the beast
Defiled words for seeking truth
From blood were said - spelled be
Incarnation sinisterous form
Wanting behold god unfogiven.
World book of the dead
Bounded with skin of flesh time is possessed
Unheard is heard - confess
Lord desecrate opens my eyes
For hell spawns of unearth haunting
The mind castle demons awake feeding the dead
The meaning of inaudible cries unholy death
Your belief is destructed
Evil ghosts come from beyond
Godless images instill in my mind
Existence is deceased creations from darkside
Bleeding for immortal.
Die in pentagram
Effigy of Nazarene
Burning in my head
Join us evil spells
Pleasures
Demons disappearance
Tortures
Sadistic cursed to hell confess
It's not real I'm dead
Endless
