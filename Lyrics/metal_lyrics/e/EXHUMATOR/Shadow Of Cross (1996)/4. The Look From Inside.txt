The star shines in the night sky
Dead glowing diminishing out of my inner
Flesh turns into one spot
That death glowing spot...
Yes I was
When it burned with whole force
I'm the one talking to you from out of the void
See what is on my way.
I am the machine that makes this madness move.
Help me to run smoother not I won't be back here
Smile I'm leaving
Ripping the body from within...
I was searching for better somewhere
Enjoy that from inside of your sanity
Learn the iron force of smashed out eyes
Understanding, rotting and enjoying.
We shall live in the perfect world
Everybody except you - ones
Who urgently needs
We shall build the one that won't be able to rot
And be broken (Jesus)
I'm leaving without understanding the whole width of unwish
But no more than
That.
