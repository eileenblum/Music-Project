Driven into deadlock
Without hope to return
Hopeless and forgotten
You're looking around without understanding
Properly been far off but not so much
As to be blind
Reality of existence are cleaned
Don't leaving a hope to reverse
Consciousness loses control over itself
Walked far of the maze of reason
Opening strange for others
You are stance for all
But no more your mind works in open space
Merged and harmonized
With those which are intractable to explanation
Became
Unseen for all
Nobody can't stop this energy
Don't know it,
You continue the motion
Inreception to pain made cover
Of your inner space to invulnerable
Leaving no chance to speak
With whole force but you want it
