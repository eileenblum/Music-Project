Such was and been
Retribution for brutal doings
Such been punishment for presumption which
Is want to achieve the knowledge of
Supreme beings, such been punishment of
Insane pride don't seeing that humans
Destiny is humility and ignorance.
Stench is wrapping soul up
If upside downed cross in heart
Stop, thinking!
Take my body and drink my blood!
Pull my heart out and take my soul!
I want that you were satisfied!
Oh, Bathaburuik, I want to know it!
Black mass with burning candles 1 summon
The breath of hell, Spells passing into
Bowels of the earth - 1 awake the
Sunphre - cold wind of death altars
Desecration by excrements,
I'm storming in abyss of sins, immolation for angel
Of darkness - aspiring to penetrate
Beyond knowledge
Continuing unholy sins,
Rotting and damned to hell
Tearing by greedy lust, taking pleasure
Until the voice from abyss will not exclaim: "it's completed!"
Your arrogant forehead will covered with agony wrinkles,
And plaintive cream of despair will escape from heart,
And reflecting in eyes with disgust and hopelesslity
Lost the same darling of the heavens gifts:
The hope falling into outcast's mob to wander in damnation
