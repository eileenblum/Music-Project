Burned in the scorching land
When souls dehydrated from a birth
Wounds bleeding
Carnage for survival on the Earth
With spells of Satan
I summon thee
We sacrifice this world of shit
Lords of death descend the fires of glowing hell
Endless pain Christians dead with smashed heads
Holocaust unleash the blood of deformed corpses
Suffer wind burns their souls
Behead the holy all sacred deceased
Ripping apart the blessed angels bleeding maggots them feast
Splattered guts of monks
Internal extraction of hallowed eves
Dismember for lord black abyss
Die - crucifixion decapitated
Die - crucifixion decapitated
Prince of flies we give you crowded sacrifice
With my disgust Nazarene and holy church
All crucifixion will be cremated for your name
Smell of decaying flesh
For the space of the endless ways
Vultures are moaning high
When angels of darkness feeding the dead
Denied inverted cross
Maggots crawling from their heads
Gods desecration laws you die with cross
And burn in hell
