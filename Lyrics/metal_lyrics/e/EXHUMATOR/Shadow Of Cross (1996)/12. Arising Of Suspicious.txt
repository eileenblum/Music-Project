In the endless flow of thoughts
You call for help without power
To stand the violent charge of energy which name is life.
Unperceiving the inevitability
Your reason pushes away death
Which day by day becomes real.
You are young and don't want to think about death
Forgotten that life gets to know through death
They told to you that you are born for life
Perceived it your consciousness
Not give a motion with whole force
Fear is your legacy and you can't stop it constantly feeling
It's breathing and arising of suspicious.
