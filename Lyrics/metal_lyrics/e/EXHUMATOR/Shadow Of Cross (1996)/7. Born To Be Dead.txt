Symbolic cross the sign of lie
So many years obscured
Born to live at some time dies
For holy one unheard your cries
Ceremony of confession
Thinking only to profit.
Seeking tomb for salvation
Blesses victims waits to die
Born to be dead
Premises of sacred oath
For whom you pray and what you want?
Born to be dead
Christening in blood
Waiting for falling of Heavenly light
Sacrifice of the virgin lives
It is the sins of the holy ones
Fall in disease
Take care of yourself
Mortals is waiting for ritual spells
Suffer!
Born to be dead
