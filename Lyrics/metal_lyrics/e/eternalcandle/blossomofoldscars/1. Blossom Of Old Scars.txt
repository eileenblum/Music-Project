Looking through the past
Searching for a key
So lost inside of me
Haze of thoughts
Makes me blind
Hopeless reaching
For the answers long gone

Wish to stop bleeding my mind
Dream that scars are healing
Looking from distance to my life
Sharp gallows ripping my thoughts
Not even a tearful look left
Just inhale the demons to end the dark

Hearing empty thoughts,
Cry on inside
Fear overcomes the faith,
Loss of humanity
Insanity rules the man,
Chaos is near to feed our lands
Scars on your heart,
Come to life to tear you apart

The end of all comes
Past, now long gone
Ruthless betrayal
Like blood on your hands
Falling inside of me
While you're watching over me
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm falling down
