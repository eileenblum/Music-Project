Depths of the unknowns,
The great dark spaces
No footsteps no clouds,
Walking so lonesome
Nothing to see here,
The silence that makes you deaf

Does this silence bother you?
Does the darkness soothe you?
Chained to the scattered thoughts
Fear of your past now

[Narration:]
Again confronted with your lies
Debt of the characters that you made for yourself
Stroke for your heart to realize
To make you wake up to see nothing's changed
You're still the same
In your grave your canyon your space
Pressure of the burden makes you silent
The silence that makes you frigid

Burning green forest, green leaf, brown roots
Turned to gray, turned to the void, shattered to the emptiness
Deharmonize, the evils, from your, inside
And listen to the sounds of your old pains haunted you

Whispers of the ancient demons
Sworn to be born wild forever....

Growth patience end,
Light pleasure end
Now it's my season, season of my moon
Season to be doomed a grief of my soul
I can not see anymore, I can not bear anyone
The hatred is grown in my thoughts and my bone
Walking in the forest thinking of the desert
I killed all of the lights
It's a price I must take
