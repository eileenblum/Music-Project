[originally by Lee Hazlewood]Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey.
Walk me out in the morning dew, leave with my love.
Can't walk you out in no morning dew, my honey.
Can't walk you out in no morning dew, leave with my heart.

I thought I heard a young girl crying, baby
I thought I heard a young girl crying, today.
You did not hear no young girl crying, baby.
You did not hear no young girl crying, my heart.

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey.
Walk me out in the morning dew, leave with my love.
I can't walk you out in no morning dew, my honey.
I can't walk you out in no morning dew, leave with my heart.

I thought I heard a young man crying, baby.
I thought I heard a young man crying, today.
You did not hear no young man crying, baby.
You did not hear no young man crying, today.

Now there is no more morning dew.
And now there is no more morning dew.
What they was saying all these years is true.
Cause there is no more morning dew.

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey.
Walk me out in the morning dew, leave with my heart.
Can't walk you out in no morning dew, my honey.
Can't walk you out in no morning dew, leave with my heart.

I thought I heard a young girl crying, baby.
I thought I heard a young girl crying, today.
You did not hear no young girl crying, baby.
You did not hear no young girl crying.

I thought I heard a young girl crying, baby.
I thought I heard a young girl crying, today.
You did not hear no young girl crying, baby.
You did not hear no young girl crying.

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey.
Oh, walk me out in the morning dew, my love.
Walk my out in the morning dew, leave with my heart.
