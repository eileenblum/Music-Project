UBIQUE MEDIA DAEMON
wallowing in my organs, my kidneys
wallowing in my liver and guts
UBIQUE MEDIA DAEMON
maybe it's horror
maybe it's terror
maybe it's horror, terror and anger
UBIQUE MEDIA DAEMON
rushing the signal through the system
rushing the signal to vessel and vein
UBIQUE MEDIA DAEMON
nothing can block the electrical impulse
once locked in it doesn't waste time
UBIQUE MEDIA DAEMON
locked in forever that's not a long time
UBIQUE MEDIA DAEMON
maybe it's horror
maybe it's terror
maybe it's horror, anger and fear
UBIQUE MEDIA -
REPETITIO INSTRUMENTUM
