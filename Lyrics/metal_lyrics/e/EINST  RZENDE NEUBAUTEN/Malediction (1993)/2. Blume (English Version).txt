Chrysantemum 
For you I am a chrysantemum
Supernova, urgent star

Astera Compositae 
For you I'll be a dandelion
a thousand flowerettes in the sky
Or just a drop in the ocean

If you know my name
don't speak it out
it holds a power - as before

Liliacea 
A lily of the valley
a flower of saron

Helianthus annus 
For you I even be a sunflower
Do you hear my enlightening laughter?
another reason to cut off an ear

You know my name, do you not?
don't say it
For it's a sacred, immovable - frozen

Rosa, Anemone et Nymphea alba 
I'll even be a waterlily,
a marygold, a rose
or a little thistle

Euphorbia
a blue dahlia, a black tulip
that's where opinions differ
the scholars disagree

My name, should you know it
remains unspeakable
and it's spoken - malediction
