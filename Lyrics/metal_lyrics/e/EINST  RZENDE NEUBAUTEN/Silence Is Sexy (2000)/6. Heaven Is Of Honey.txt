Heaven is of honey
And kisses 
Beeswork
Blossomchannels
How do I know?
How could I forget?

Heaven is in the making
Remains unfinished
A possibility
If there's a glipse of it
In the little dance of tongues

As a reminder
As a reminder

Heaven is all remembered
As an ideal
For idiots 
Possessed by Gods
That just waste space
In case I wake up without a pen
I do not want to forget

That Heaven is of honey
And kisses
Royal jelly
For the Queenbee
In the centre
How do I know?
How could I forget?
