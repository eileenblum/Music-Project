- You see half the moon... its crescent... and one of the planets... maybe Saturn... maybe Jupiter... in the early night sky over Berlin... through the windows of a taxicab, near Potsdamer Platz.
You think: ...Beauty.

- No, this is not beauty...
- Maybe not?
- Maybe... This is the rest of it...
- Maybe not?
- Maybe... The rest of beauty...
- Maybe not...
- Maybe... What remains of beauty...
- Maybe not...
- Maybe... What is visible.
- Certainly.
- Uncertain.

- Your arms would not be able to stretch as far as necessary to form an adequate gesture for beauty.
- You know that, don't you?
- So... beauty remains in the impossibilities of the body.
