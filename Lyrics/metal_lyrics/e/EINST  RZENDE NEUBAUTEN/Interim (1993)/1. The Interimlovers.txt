During one slip of the tongue
there is big bang and total entropy
from red giants to white dwarfs
the whole scale
of cosmic dimensions are falling
out of my mouth
in the description of a kiss
of the interimlovers

of the interimlovers
in the interim

between microphone and macrocosm
between genesis und sixsixsix
in between and on the bÐ¾ttom of the sea
between plankton und philosophy

there they are
the interimlovers

in their communal mouth
lives a hummingbird
with each beat of its wings
too swift for any eye to see
cultures flourish and perish
whole continents vanish
i wade through the filth of mighty metaphors
meta, meta, meta by metre
with gestures far too wide
for the interimlovers

the interimlovers
are lovers in the
INTERIM

between temporary and tempura
between tightrope and sabre dance
between chaos and with no course at all
between semtex and utopia

there they are
the interimlovers


in the course of just one
winking beat of an eye
they have putsched
the government was felled
parliament dissolved
elections held
results annulled
new elections called
then finally exiled
in history reviled
I wade through the filth of mighty 
metaphors
meta, meta, meta by metre
with gestures far too wide
for the interimlovers

the interimlovers
are lovers in the interim

between temporary and tempura
between tightrope and sabre dance
between chaos and with no course at all
between semtex and utopia
there they are
the interimlovers
right there in each others arms

thirstily devour
the last drop of light
they are not there yesterday
and tomorrow not yet

the lovers
the interimlovers
they are not there yesterday
and tomorrow not yet
the interimlovers
they are not there yesterday
and tomorrow not yet
es gibt sie gestern nicht mehr
und morgen noch nicht
