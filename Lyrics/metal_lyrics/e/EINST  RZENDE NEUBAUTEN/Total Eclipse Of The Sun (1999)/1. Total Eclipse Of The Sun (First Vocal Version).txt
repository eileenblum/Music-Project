The beauty, tender glow extinguished
the sky dull from a breeze
ghostly the dawn without its red
uncanny, stranged to our nature
the light like lead
ripped in the dark
a tiny sichle
as small as cut by a surgical knife

the suns last spark melts away
not unlike a dying wick
now stands disc on disc
and crushes my heart

All I really, really, really want to see
is a total eclipse of the sun

'Ah' says everyone
just as the birds are silent
with surprise

All I really, really, really want to see
is a total eclipse of the sun
