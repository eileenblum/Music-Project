Darkness embrace me 
Cast away the works of light 
Wrap me up from sole to crown 
Swallow me on the whole 
I feel so safe in your womb 
I devote myself to you 
I want you to 
Lock me up in your cage 
Domesticate the beast in me

Hanging around in the darkest dungeons unbound 
I live off 
Live off the blood 
Of the architects of my Apocalypse
(For another round)

Blackness caress me 
Let me drown in your depths 
Glamorize my blind side 
Leave your mark on my pride 
The smell of fornication 
Bad conscience and guilt 
I want you to 
Lock me up in your cage 
Domesticate the beast in me

Hanging around in the darkest dungeons unbound 
I live off 
Live off the blood 
Of the architects of my Apocalypse

Lock me up in your cage 
Domesticate the beast in me 
Lock me up in your cage 
Domesticate the beast in me

Hanging around in the darkest dungeons unbound 
I live off 
Live off the blood 
Of the architects of my Apocalypse 
For another round

Hanging around in the darkest dungeons unbound 
I live off 
Live off the blood 
Of the architects of my Apocalypse
