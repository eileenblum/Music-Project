There's no doubt he's back in town 
Can't you feel he's sneakin' around again 
The shepherd of all guilt that brought us 
To the verge of a massive meltdown 
Meltdown

Are we all too blind to see 
He's around again round again 
We're falling deeper into sin 
Here he comes again comes again

In the absence of light he took over our lives 
Trying to make us believe he doesn't exist 
Another crash the black box not found 
We're on the verge of a massive meltdown 
Meltdown

Are we all too blind to see 
He's around again round again 
We're falling deeper into sin 
Here he comes again comes again
(you'd better be ready) 
(you'd better be ready) 
(you'd better be.........ready)

Stop believing he doesn't exist 
We'll hit rock bottom 
This is the downfall 
Another crash the black box not found 
We'll hit rock bottom 
This is the downfall

He does it with a kiss 
He does it like Judas did 
Not brave enough to take the sword 
Look what we have become 
He has got us on our balls 
This is the massive meltdown 
Meltdown meltdown 
Meltdown
(he does it with a kiss)

Are we all too blind to see 
He's around again round again 
We're falling deeper into sin 
Here he comes again comes again
Are we all too blind to see 
He's around again round again 
We're falling deeper into sin 
Here he comes again comes again
(you'd better be ready) 
(you'd better be) 
(you'd better be ready) 
(you'd better be)
