Here comes the fire - the cleansing fire

Now that all the damage is done 
Your wretched soul is on the run 
Riddled with guilt you wanna come undone 
Let it in let the mourning come 
Feel the heat

Here comes the fire - the cleansing fire

We all come to rearrange your life 
Yes we all come to rearrange 
We're the disciples of the flames 
We're acting in their name 
We are the nemeses of pain 
The cleansing from sin

We are the fire

You epitomize mankind's demise 
Disguising hate as a social guy 
Free from conscience faith and creed 
Leave your burden to the fire's breed 
Feel the heat

Here comes the fire - the cleansing fire

We all come to rearrange your life 
Yes we all come to rearrange 
We're the disciples of the flames 
We're acting in their name 
We are the nemeses of pain 
The cleansing from sin

We are the fire

Confutatis maledictis 
Flammis acribus adictis 
When the wicked are confounded 
Doomed to flames of woe unbounded [4x]

Now that the damage is done your wretched soul is on the run 
We're on red alert we'll come to rearrange all that's gone wrong

We are the fire - the cleansing fire

We all come to rearrange your life 
Yes we all come to rearrange 
We're the disciples of the flames 
We're acting in their name 
We are the nemeses of pain 
The cleansing from sin 
We all come to rearrange your life 
Yes we all come to rearrange
