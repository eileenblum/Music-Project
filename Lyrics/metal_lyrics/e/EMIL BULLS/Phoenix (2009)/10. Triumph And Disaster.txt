In my heart it's summertime my world is shining in brightness light 
I'm sober my mind is clear nothing and nobody haunts me here 
The sweetest sounds I let it all hang out 
In a moving and majestic atmosphere 
A divine revelation

Born for my delight 
Born to ease born to excite 
May her reign never end 
I've never been closer to you, closer to you sweet love 
I walk between triumph and disaster 
For you

Whenever the tide sets in 
To drown my senses from within 
To terrorize all of my thoughts 
And break open long forgotten wounds 
Her various works guide me out of misery 
Her imperial arms offer relief 
A divine revelation

Born for my delight 
Born to ease born to excite 
May her reign never end 
I've never been closer to you, closer to you sweet love 
I walk between triumph and disaster 
For you

I take you from this day forward for better or for worse 
For richer for poorer in sickness in health to love an to cherish 
From this day forward, from this day forward until 
From this day 
From this day forward until 
From this day 
From this day forward until 
Death do us part

Born for my delight 
Born to ease born to excite 
May her reign never end 
I've never been closer to you, closer to you sweet love 
Born for my delight 
Born to ease born to excite 
May her reign never end 
I've never been closer to you, closer to you sweet love 
I walk between triumph and disaster 
Triumph and disaster!
