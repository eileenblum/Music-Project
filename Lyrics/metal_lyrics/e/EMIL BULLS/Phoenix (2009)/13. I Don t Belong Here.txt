Thank god I finally know
This ship is out of control
Thank god I have the balls to leave it to the sea
Got my lifeboat well prepared
I'm gonna breath virgin air
I'm gonna smell the scent
Of a new island

It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I just can't stay here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I don't belong here

I've got the wind at my back
The sun upon my face
The wings of my belief
Carry me to the stars
I wanna spend my days
In a place without any memories
Where the wounds of experience
Can find a chance to heal

It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I just can't stay here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I don't belong here

And I, I won't need you tomorrow
Like you don't care today
We'd well in constant sorrow
Sorrow is the name
Of your game
I don't belong here

God, I don't belong here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I just can't stay here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
God, I don't belong here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I just can't stay here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
God, I don't belong here
God, I don't belong here
I don't belong here
