Pardon me
Mr. Half Baked
May I introduce to you
The incarnation of a conflagration
Get up

The harder you pull the tighter it gets
We're young and committed
We'll give you the whole nine yards

Yeah!
We'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Like we've been from the start
Yeah we'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Hungry at heart we know
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do
'Cause we're so hungry at heart there's nothing in this world
That we couldn't do

Only the future knows where this road will take us
We're about to find out
We've got the engine and the fuel

Yeah!
We'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Like we've been from the start
Yeah we'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Hungry at heart we know
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do
'Cause we're so hungry at heart there's nothing in this world
That we couldn't do

No one can stop us now
Hungry at heart we know
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do

Yeah!
We'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Like we've been from the start
Yeah we'll never stop we'll never give up
Hungry at heart
Hungry at heart we know
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do
'Cause we're so hungry at heart there's nothing in this world
That we couldn't do
There's nothing in this world that we couldn't do
'Cause we're so hungry at heart there's nothing in this world
That we couldn't do
