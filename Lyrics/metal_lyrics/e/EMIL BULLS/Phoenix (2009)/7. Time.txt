I don't know what time it is
I don't care what day we have
Don't give a fuck about my age
Shall the seasons change
Summer winter autumn spring
March April May don't mean a thing
Let it rain let the sun smile

You will never change my way
A crusade against the slavery of time
Sets an example of transcendent liberty

You try to tell me what to eat
Try to tell me when to sleep
Wanna dictate my routine
You try to hijack my mind
You will pull the shortest straw
In the futile fight against the fugacity of life

You will never change my way
A crusade against the slavery of time
Sets an example of transcendent liberty

(Watch me)
Like eternity I'll break through time
While this world drowns in its greed
I'll do it on my own
Like no one's done it before

I don't know what time it is
I don't care what day we have
Don't give a fuck about my age
Shall the seasons change
Summer winter autumn spring
March April May don't mean a thing
Let it rain let the sun smile
I'm not yours
You will never change my way
Like eternity I'll break trough time
I'm not yours
You will never change my way
I'm on a trans-boundary crusade
I'm not yours
Go out of my way
I can do it on my own
I will do it on my own
And you
You will never change my way

A crusade against the slavery of time
Sets an example of transcendent liberty

Like eternity I'll break through time
While this world drowns in its greed
I'll do it on my own
Like no one's done it before

Like eternity I'll break through time
While this world drowns in its greed
I'll do it on my own
Like no one's done it before
