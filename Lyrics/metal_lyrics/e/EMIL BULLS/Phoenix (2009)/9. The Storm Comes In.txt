Incoming!

There will be a blaze
Bright like sun
To knell the resign of nothingness
When the ashes lay down on barren fields
Of our dismantled civilization
Everything will perish by cold

Will you take care of me
When all love has died away
Will you remember me the day the storm comes in

This is a war
There will be blood
Doom's sword will strike
With deadly aim
When the ashes lay down on barren fields
Of our dismantled civilization
Everything will perish by cold

Will you take care of me when all love has died away
Will you remember me the day the storm comes in
Will you take care of me - will you remember me
Will you take care of me - when everything burst into flames

Will you take care of me when all love has died away
Will you remember me the day the storm comes in
Will you take care of me when all love has died away
Will you remember me the day the storm comes in
The storm comes in
The storm comes in
