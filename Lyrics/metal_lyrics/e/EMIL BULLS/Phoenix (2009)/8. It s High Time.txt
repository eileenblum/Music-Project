Have mercy on me 
An endless blankness is rising 
I face my own demise an realize 
In my mind I'm already dead

Fire return into my life
Fire come back in inject
Your spirit into
My mind
Fire don't you

Don't you ever leave my side
It's high time
Guide me through life
It's high time
From the darkest valley to
The far side of the moon
Don't you ever leave my side

My worst enemies
A magnetic attraction towards me
Full speed exceed the limit
This is far beyond my control

Fire return into my life
Fire come back inject
Your spirit into
My mind
Fire don't you

Don't you ever leave my side
It's high time
Guide me through life
It's high time
From the darkest valley to
The far side of the moon
Don't you ever leave my side

Don't you ever leave my side
It's high time
Guide me through life
It's high time
From the darkest valley to
The far side of the moon
Don't you ever leave my side
