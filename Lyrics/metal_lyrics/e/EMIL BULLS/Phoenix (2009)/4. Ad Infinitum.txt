Feels like talking to a wall that's rising out of control 
Like the fish's mind growing numb from circling the bowl 
Come on now gimme a reason that makes me wanna move on 
That makes me wanna fight again 
Just tell it like it is
Come

Gimme a signal show me a sign I've been waiting patiently 
I'm running dry still I bleed an everflowing stream

It's like losing all you unconditionally love 
It's not the puzzle that's to blame when the pieces won't fall into place 
Come on now gimme a reason that makes me wanna move on 
That makes me wanna fight again 
Just tell it like it is 
Come

Gimme a signal show me a sign I've been waiting patiently 
I'm running dry still I bleed an everflowing stream

I can't take it anymore 
There's fire in the hole 
Get down

Gimme a signal show me a sign I've been waiting patiently 
I'm running dry still I bleed an everflowing stream
Gimme a signal show me a sign I've been waiting patiently 
I'm running dry still I bleed an everflowing stream

Just tell it
Like it is 
Come on
I would kill for it
