Night - a dark city 
I am with the wolves 
Time for supper 
All our senses chasing you 
The hunt is on 
No seed to run 
We'll get you anyway 

Hey you Hey you 
Hey you Hey you 

[Chorus:]
I told you all the things you had to know about 
Me and Rock'n'Roll 
It takes your blood and your tears to get on top 
I told you all the things you had to know about 
Me and the moon 
Here's the truth that you wanted to deny 

Night - the moon is full 
In the pale glow 
We're heading to the streets below 
You're everywhere 
In the cool night air 
You can't throw us off the scent 

Hey you Hey you 
Hey you Hey you 

[Chorus]

After all it's your blood that will unite us all 
In the end your blood will unite the pack forever 
You know about me and the moon 

I told you all the things you had to know about 
Me and Rock'n'Roll 
It takes your blood and your tears to get on top 
I told you all the things you had to know about 
Me and the moon 
Here's the truth that you wanted to deny 
Hereâs the truth that you wanted to deny forever
