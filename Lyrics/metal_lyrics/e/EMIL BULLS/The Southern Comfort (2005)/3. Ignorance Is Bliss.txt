[Chorus:] 
Another day goes by, I wanna push rewind 
Another sleepless night, it's eating me alive 
Another day goes by, I wanna push rewind 
Another sleepless night, it's eating me alive 

The tide shifts the sand, the waves corrode the shore 
Cancer will eat us all. Well surrender one bye one 

Greed took all emotions from me 
Protect me from what I want 

[Chorus]

Tracks lead to stations. I'm going nowhere 
Dullness will kill us all. Well be dreaming on and on 

Greed took all emotions from me 
Protect me from what I want 

[Chorus]

Greed took all emotions from me 
Protect me from what I want 

Another day goes bye. I wanna push rewind 
Another sleepless night. It's eating me alive [x4]
