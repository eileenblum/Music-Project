Don't wanna blame the rest of this world
For everything that is wrong with my life
Don't wanna say what my childhood was like
Don't wanna answer the phone this time
But this is too big to hide

It's over now, it's unbelievable
I just feel like a diamond on a crown
I'm so happy, it's unbelievable now
I just feel newborn

Don't wanna dig up my own history
Don't wanna sing about what life could be
Don't wanna say what I'm about to say
Don't wanna excuse myself day by day
But this is too big to hide

It's over now, it's unbelievable
I just feel like a diamond on a crown
I'm so happy, it's unbelievable now
I just feel newborn

Too big for

It's over, I'm newborn, so this is
This is too big to hide

It's over now oh yes it's unbelievable
I just feel like a diamond on a crown
I'm so happy oh yes it's unbelievable
Now â I just feel newborn
It's over now it's unbelievable
I just feel like a diamond on a crown
I'm so happy it's unbelievable
Now â I just feel newborn
