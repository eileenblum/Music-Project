All right yeah 

No bitchinâ no fightinâ the drugs are for free 
We know all the tricks we belong to the scene 
The wheel of fortune rolls to us again 
Weâll take your queen 
Surprise â checkmate 

Around the world boys and girls 
Willing to believe in your lies 
My magnificent lies 
Better be scared be aware 
Just take a look at the sins of your life 
We took all your conscience away 

Live and alive weâre back from the dead 
Weâll give you something youâll never forget 
Girls liquor sex 
Will doom us again 
You gonna sweat blood 
When we unleash hell 

Weâre the wolves and youâre the lamb 

Around the world boys and girls 
Are willing to believe in your lies 
My magnificent lies 
Better be scared be aware 
Just take a look at the sins of your life 
We took all your conscience away 

Weâre the wolves and youâre the goddamn lamb 
We get hardly anything out of anything 
Weâre in bad shape 
Weâre in lousy shape 
But we got the guts 

Around the world boys and girls 
Are willing to believe in our lies 
My magnificent lies 
Better be scared be aware 
Just take a look at the sins of your life 
We took all your conscience away 
Just confess just confess just confess them all 
The sins of your life the sins of your nights to me 
Them all to me
