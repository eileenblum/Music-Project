Eyes like whiskey - A cocaine smile 
Tonight she's mine - The berg's superfly 
A body shaped like a Cadillac 
I wanna show my skills and ride it all night 

I know a place where we both can hide 
I know a place where we can spend the night 
Follow me and leave your timidity at home 
I'll introduce you to the rules of Fleischberg's 

All seductive in the obscene 
I feel the fire it burns like a drug 
A matter of fact you're melting ice 
I hold the world in my sticky sweaty hands 

I know a place where we both can hide 
I know a place where we can spend the night 
Follow me and leave your timidity at home 
I'll introduce you to the rules of Fleischberg's 

It's getting hot baby 
You're like a shot 

Hop in get comfy I'll take you for a ride 
Stop waiting for love that will never come 
Come on 

I know a place where we both can hide 
I know a place where we can spend the night 
Follow me and leave your timidity at home 
I'll introduce you to the rules of Fleischberg's
