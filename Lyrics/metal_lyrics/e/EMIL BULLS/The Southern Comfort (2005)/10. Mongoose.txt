Hey girl I'm taking to you 
I'm still unable to do 
Everything you want me to 
And by the way 
I'm all addicted to you 
Your love is all 
Just all I ever wanted
Now you're walking out the door 
With this fake smile on your face 
You act like you were bored 
But your eyes are craving for more 
Oh yeah this is the truth you will deny girl
You were like a tatoo 
We were like ball and chain 
In this curious game 
And by the way 
I'm still addicted to love 
But vanity spun it's net 
Around our frozen hearts
Now you're walking out the door 
With this fake smile on your face 
You act like you were bored 
But your eyes are craving for more 
Oh yeah this is the truth you will deny girl
