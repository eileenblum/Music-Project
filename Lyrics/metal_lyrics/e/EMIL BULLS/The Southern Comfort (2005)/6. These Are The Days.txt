When the moon and I are talking
Down by the riverside
The old man and me alone
When I hear the gentle whistling
From the whirlwind in the trees
And the scent of the summer feels so intense

These are the days I remember you
Singing our songs to me

Oh these are the days
I remember you
Celebrating life
Like the world was yours

When the walls come tumbling down
And I'm feeling down and out
I just open up a six pack of memories
Light a cigarette grab my best friend Jack and
Lose myself in
The warm distortion that's on my stereo

These are the days I remember you
Singing our songs to me

Oh these are the days
I remember you
Celebrating life
Like the world was yours

I'm floating I'm floating home to you
My wooden verb heartbeat just gives me the creeps
Tonight I'm coming I'm coming home to you

Oh these are the days
I remember you
Celebrating life
Like the world was yours
Oh these are the days
I remember you
Celebrating life
Like the world was yours
