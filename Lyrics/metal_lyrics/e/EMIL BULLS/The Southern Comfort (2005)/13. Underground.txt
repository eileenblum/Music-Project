Going down underground
Darkness all along
Hear gods calling me
His army is at my heels

There's something inside me to tells me
Boy you should run
A bad moon is rising stay awake
It's over!
We're all are running out of life

Don't fall asleep tonight
You might never see the morning light
Enjoy life before you die
We're all running out of time

There's something inside me to tells me
Boy you should run
A bad moon is rising stay awake
It's over!
We're all are running out of life
It's over
We're all gonna die tonight

(God's army is at my heels)
(God's army is at my heels )
We're all gonna die tonight
We're all gonna die tonight

There's something inside me to tells me
Boy you should run
A bad moon is rising stay awake
It's over!
We're all are running out of life
It's over
We're all gonna die tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
We all
We all
We all
We all die
