Life is a game we should play
According to the rules
But where is the Fun
When were not allowed
To play sometimes

Burn baby burn baby burn your heart for me
Smile baby smile baby
Let the sun shine for me

Nothing exceeds like excess
Its hard to say no boy
Make a wish take a bite
That apple is waiting for you

Burn baby burn baby burn your heart for me
Smile baby smile baby
Let the sun shine for me

I know the stakes are high
Welcome to the limit
Close to the cigar
Its the roll of the dice

Burn baby burn baby burn your heart for me
Smile baby smile baby
Let the sun shine for me

Just smile and let the sunshine in
It makes me feel alive tonight
Just go on

Burn baby burn baby burn your heart for me
Smile baby smile baby
Let the sun shine for me
