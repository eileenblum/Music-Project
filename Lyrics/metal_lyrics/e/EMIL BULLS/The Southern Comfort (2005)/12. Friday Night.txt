Hi fans here I am again 
Tonight I'm your man 
Watch out the boy is loaded 
A fireball ready to explode 
Here comes the hot shot 
Let me entertain 
The girls the punks the drunks 
I know what you people need 
Your pleasure my deal
Now let us all lose our dignity tonight
Just getting high on a Friday night 
Girls cash fights mud blood and beer 
We're wasting time and energy 
Losing grip fooling gravity 
Just getting high on a Friday night 
Girls bar fights mud blood and beer 
We're wasting time and energy 
Losing grip fooling gravity
Let's dance I'll do it power-stance 
No remorse no regrets 
The king of puns 
Wizard of whoopee 
Boom chicka boom 
I ain't no rookie 
King for a lifetime in the promised land 
The girls the cash the drugs 
They scream boy you're looking good 
What happened last night
Now let us all lose our dignity tonight
Just getting high on a Friday night 
Girls cash fights mud blood and beer 
We're wasting time and energy 
Losing grip folling gravity 
Just getting high on a Friday night 
Girls bar fights mud blood and beer 
We're wasting time and energy 
Losing grip fooling gravity
And all my songs to make you happy 
My show has just begun 
I'll need that smile of yours forever 
I'll get you yes I'll get you I'll get you one by one 
Do it one more time
Just gettin' high on a Friday night 
Girls cash fights mud blood and beer 
We're wasting time and energy 
Losing grip fooling gravity 
Just getting high on a Friday night 
The girls the cash the drugs 
We're fooling gravity tonight 
Just getting high on a Friday night 
The girls the cash the drugs 
We're fooling gravity 
Just getting high on a Friday night 
Girls bar fights mud blood and beer 
We're wasting time and energy 
Losing grip fooling gravity
