Improvised, modified, dead, overcome
Improvised, modified, dead, overcome
Improvised, modified, dead, overcome
Improvised, modified, dead, now Fire!

We all lay down with bugs now we got the flees
We put gas in the fires of our enemies
Our excesses are know, our successes not
Wasting time, fighting rules, coming out to pull

Improvised, modified, dead, overcome
Improvised, modified, dead, overcome

This is the time, this is the place for the great revenge
This is the day to say FireFuckYou
It is the anger, itâs the hate that motivates
We rise from the ashes with our FireFuckYou

Yes we know all thatâs been, was it comedy
And we dug our own grave from the TV screen
Got the pash, got the strength to take its mistakes
We can pull ourselves out of any hole

Improvised, modified, dead, overcome
Improvised, modified, dead, overcome

This is the time this is the place for the great revenge
This is the day to say FireFuckYou
It is the anger itâs the hate that motivates
We rise from the ashes with our FireFuckYou

The more you hate, the more you learn
We know it will hurt a lot
But in the end we're right

This is the time this is the place for the great revenge
This is the day to say FireFuckYou
It is the anger itâs the hate that motivates
We rise from the ashes with our FireFuckYou

Hey you, this is the great revenge
This is the day to say FireFuckYou

Hey you, this is the revenge
This is the day to say FireFuckYou all
Fire fuck you all
Fire fuck you all
