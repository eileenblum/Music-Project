Deep inside I don't feel alright
It burns like fire
It's twined around by barb wire
It pricks it bites
You'll need a life to cut it out
I'm too shy I'm too dumb unable to talk about the things that are hurting me
It's so sad I can't turn my inside out
It's so sad so many things to share
It's so sad maybe I can't show my love
It's so sad now I'm leaving you with this
Deep inside I hide a secret
