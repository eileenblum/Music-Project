Do you think it's easy to forget
Time heals nothing
That's why I lie awake
My spirit seems to leave me now
My vital spark burns out
Me my god IÂ´m 23
My eve of life has just begun (already begun)
Wheels of steel
Drive the ruin of my inner self
God watch me before I end like you
I cried when I wrote this song (song)
Maybe IÂ´m too weak
I took this pain my whole life long
I feel like a rainy day a cold night in fall (fall)
The red light turns to green right now
So why fighting back these tears
Wheels of steel
Drive the ruin of my inner self
God watch me
Before I end like
You and all the others especially like the father
Whose children give pure hate not respect
Yeah... I am on a ride
I'm searching for a different... mine IÂ´m still not the one IÂ´m trying to find
Once more I drink the pain away
God watch me before I end like you ...Oh once more...
Please save me from myself
I don't want to extinguish myself
I don't want to fade out
