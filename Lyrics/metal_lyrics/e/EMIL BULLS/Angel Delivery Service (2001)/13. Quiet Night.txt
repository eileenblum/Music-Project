Please let me sleep right
Now just for tonight
It's cold but I sweat
I can't escape the
Last day IÂ´m wasting away
All thoughts are full of dismay
Oh... please switch off the light
Cause I wanna sleep quiet and deep
I wanna keep
(all this shit)
Out of my bed
I wanna conclude right now
Ohhoohhoow...
IÂ´m ready to retire
I've had enough now
I'm sick and tired of all I love
Tired of sex
Tired of alcohol
My best friends seem so strange
IÂ´ve got to get myself rearranged
Last day won't let go again
