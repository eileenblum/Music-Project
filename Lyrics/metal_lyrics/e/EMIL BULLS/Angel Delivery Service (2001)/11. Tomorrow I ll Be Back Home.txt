[Olli:]
Down,

[Christ:] Mix it up baby
This is for my whole crew
Comizua fellas uh
Emil Bulls (Haha), pain in the ass (haha), such a surge
Gimme more gimme more
Give an app for the style school

[Olli:]
Now It's calm down around the place nothing recalls
Of what happened right here (of what happened right here)
The show is over and we say goodbye
All the remains is a strange kind of fear Yeah

[Christ:]

A long time I've been waiting for that thing to come
[Olli:]

Am I wasting my life

[Christ:]
By doing the thing I love

[Olli:]
Am I the type of guy

[Christ:]
Who never ever really could be loved

[Olli:]
It's like a pain in the ass ...I'm crushed by the longing for feeling
You next to me (you next to me)
It pricks like hot needles in my eyes
I'm afraid of things I realize

[Christ:]
Oh tonight I don't want to sleep alone ?

[Olli:]
Am I wasting my Life? Who never ever could be loved
Yeah
DJ ZamZoe turn it on

[Christ:]
A long time I've been waiting for that thing to come

[Olli:]
Am I wasting my life

[Christ:]
By doing the thing I love

[Olli:]
Am I the type of guy

[Christ:]
Who never ever really could be loved

[Olli:]
Tomorrow I'll be back home
