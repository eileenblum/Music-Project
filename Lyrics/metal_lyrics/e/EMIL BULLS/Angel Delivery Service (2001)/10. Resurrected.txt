Like a bolt from the blue
I'm the boy I never knew
Suddenly I hate myself
My band and the whole crew
So I step out for some days
To damn my entire life oh I
Wanna reinvent myself
So recharge the light... over my head
This bright... white light... over my head... that showed me the way
To the other side where I can be myself
I wanna meet me myself and I
For dinner tonight we three cool guys
Who are about to find their lives
I see myself giggling with this chick while me gets drunk with I
So recharge the light... over my head
This bright... white light... over my head... that showed me the way

[Solo]

After three days Christ is back
Kissed blessed glistened shining glamours and clean
A fresh bulb in the socket
So recharge.... [2x]
Please don't burn out!
Please don't burn out!
Please don't burn out!
Please don't burn... out!
