Dear hesitation
Get out of my way
I'll pick a fight with you
And you know I will win
With legions of ideas up my sleeve
I'm alone in my beliefs
Go paddle you own canoe
You can't walk in my shoes
Don't you ever dare

[Chorus 2x]
I won't stop until I hold all the aces
This time I'm gonna go for gold
I've learned my lessons from losses
The lamb in me became a lion

Goodbye resignation
I gotta get rid of you
I won't bury my head in the sand
Persistence will prevail
When the past is coming back to haunt me
I'm not the one to bow and scrape
I escape into the future
To expand my way
Don't you ever dare

[Chorus 2x]

I'll never bury my head in the sand
I'm not the one to bow and scrape
Your sinister vibes can't bring me down
The lamb in me became a lion
You will never get me [3x]
You can't bring me down

[Chorus 5x]

I'm gonna go for gold [3x]
