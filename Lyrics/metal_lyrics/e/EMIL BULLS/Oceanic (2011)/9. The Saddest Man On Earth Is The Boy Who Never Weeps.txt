Hello distressed godess
Good to see you again
You look tired but it suits you well
I travelled many roads to find my way
Back into your arms
I missed you like hell

The saddest man on earth is the boy who never weeps
In your arms
I forget about the world
I'm far over the moon
I'm in heaven god I missed it like hell

You look at me trough your weary eyes
With a smile that makes stones cry
Put your memories into your shrine
For another eternity
I'll miss you like hell

The saddest man on earth is the boy who never weeps
In your arms
I forget about the world
I'm far over the moon
I'm in heaven god I missed it like hell

There are dark days ahead
My worst enemy longing will come knockin and scratching at my door
I keep you in my heart
Wherever it may lead me
The back of beyond or into the unknown
The saddest man on earth is the boy who never weeps
With you I'm so happy I could cry

Here in your arms
I forget about the world
I'm far over the moon
I'm in heaven god I missed it like hell
(Don't ever let me go)
