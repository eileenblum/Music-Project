This is the end of the road
Welcome to the edge of the world

PatienceÂ´s gonna die when youÂ´re too fast
We gotta save her to build the things that last
We gotta keep momentum alive
To escape the chokehold of time
Watch out now
Dysfunction will drown your way
When the floodgates break

I just canÂ´t take it
Take it anymore

This is the end of the road
(Slowdown or split like atoms in an a-bomb)
Welcome to the edge of the world
(Watch your step you might fall into oblivion)
You gotta slow down
Gotta watch your step now
You might fall into oblivion
The jaws of oblivion
The jaws of oblivion
(Out of sight, out of mind)

Needless to say we need a change
So stop burning the candle at both ends
Apply the brakes immediately
For a new focus aim and clrity
Watch out now
Dysfunction will drown your way
When the floodgates break

I just canÂ´t take it
Take it anymore

This is the end of the road
