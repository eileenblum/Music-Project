Just a little bit closer, save us, guide us, keep us warm, just protect us from our inner self,
Closer, save us, guide us, keep us warm, just protect us from our inner self. 

It's feeding time
Give us all the things we lust for
Still our greed with all you got
And then give us some more
We're at the gates
Now open sesame
We can't get enough
Oh won't you come?

[Chorus]
Just a little bit closer, save us, guide us, keep us warm, just protect us from our inner self
Closer, save us, guide us, keep us warm, just protect us from our inner self. 
It slips back to bad old ways, the plague is coming home
The concubines of debauchery 
Sing their slinky song.
The blood is pumping in our heads
We're foaming at the mouth
Like greedy dogs we're waiting for you to set us free
Epiphany.

Devil may care
Abstemiousness go fuck you
Hedonism is the most faithful friend on our dissolute crusade
We gang together
Like bees round the honey pot
Give us your blood
Oh won't you come?

[Chorus]

Give us booze, give us birds, give us gold
And ivory gluttony revelry come on open sesame, now open sesame
We need supplies to overindulge.

[Chorus]
