Hey princess
I'm your knight in shining armour
Come jump on my horse, take a ride with me in the starlight
My fulgend lance will hit the dragons &amp; the robbers
My sword will keep this dream alive

[Ref. 1]
I don't wanna wake up - I don't wanna wake up
Keep this dream alive
I can't get enough so let's go for another ride
I wanna sing - I wanna dance
Let me take you all around the world tonight

In my dream I am king
So don't you ever dare to wake me
I might loose the one
Heaven's sent so save me
My queen - Pristine
With grace as pure as the driven snow
I try to keep this dream alive

[Ref. 2]
I'm your knight in shining armour
Get in the saddle
I'm gonna show you my world
I wanna sing - I wanna dance
I just wanna fall in love tonight

Let's escape into the beauty of the night
'Cause when the morning wakes me all this will fade away
Yeah, I gotta keep this dream alive
Oh oh oh, I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna wake up

Come on, let's keep this dream alive

[Ref. 1]
I don't wanna wake up - I don't wanna wake up
Keep this dream alive
I can't get enough so let's go for another ride
I wanna sing - I wanna dance
Let me take you all around the world tonight

[Ref. 2]
I'm your knight in shining armour
Get in the saddle
I'm gonna show you my world
I wanna sing - I wanna dance
I just wanna fall in love tonight
