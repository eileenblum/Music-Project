You raise cathedrals
Divine and precious
Your mind is ocean sized
You cause avalanches
Grand and impressive
YouÂ´re the calm and youÂ´re the storm

You reach the highest ground
You amaze in flawless charm
Your achievements are beyond belief
You soothe the savage heart
The rivers of your works
Nurture fields of joy
YouÂ´re the salt of the earth
Captain my captain
You will never let me down

To need you to feel to breathe you
Is what Iâm living for
So now I bow to you
To need you to feel you to breathe you
Is what Iâm living for
Is what Iâm living living for

YouÂ´re the food of love
You teach us how to feel
You capture the essence
Of sadness solace and joy
At any given time
I could die in your embrace
So play on play on play on
Captain my captain
You will never let me down

To need you to feel you to breath you
...

You raise cathedrals
Divine and precious
Your mind is ocean sized
Captain my captain
Thy name is music
