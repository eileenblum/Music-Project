If life was a trumped-up-story
WeÂ´d be cowboys or rockstars
We could stage our own legend
And then emigrate to mars
If fiction was our guide we could live gunsliger style
Thank god we donÂ´t believe in ifs
Cause if we would weÂ´d die like Billy the Kid
Like the raindrop becomes a river and the river becomes an ocean

We all still donÂ´t give a fuck
Everybody sing
We all still donÂ´t give a fuck
Come on
We all still donÂ´t give a fuck
Everybody sing
We all donÂ´t believe in ifs
Damn right

If weÂ´d change everything we are
We all could be superstars
If we wouldnÂ´t need a good advice
WeÂ´d let the dice decide
If weÂ´d drink alcohol all day we could write like Hemingway
Thank god we we donÂ´t believe in ifs
'Cause if we would weÂ´d die like Bon Scott did
Like the raindrop becomes a river and the river becomes an ocean

We all still donÂ´t give a fuck
...

We donÂ´t give a fuck
We donÂ´t give a fuck
We donÂ´t give a fuck
Say what
Say what
Say what
We donÂ´t give a fuck
We donÂ´t give a fuck
We donÂ´t give a fuck
Say what
Say what
Say what

Like the raindrop becomes a river and the river becomes an ocean

We all still donÂ´t give a fuck
