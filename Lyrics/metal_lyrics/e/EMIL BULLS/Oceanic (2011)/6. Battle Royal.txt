Love oh love
You're just a sneaky dog from hell
A backstabbing deamon
Who craves to party with our pain
Again and again
You plow the fields of broken hearts
In the end
We're all easy prey for you

Die right here in my arms
Die right here with me
Die in my arms die with a smile as bright as the sun
I need someone to
Die in my arms die with a smile as bright as the sun

Love oh love
Your empire is forged in battle
A battle royal
That tears and rips our souls apart
Again and again
We welcome you with open arms
In the end
We all got eaten alive

Die right here in my arms
Die right here with me
Die in my arms die with a smile as bright as the sun
I need someone to
Die in my arms die with a smile as bright as the sun

Die in my arms die with a smile as bright as the sun
Right now I want you to
Die in my arms die with a smile as bright as the sun
