When the city sleeps in peace all your questions run deep
When the restless wolfs gather nose to the wind
In the favour of the night a monster creeps into your mind
It comes in an ambush as soon as you switch off the light

It haunts you it drowns you it chokes you it's eating your soul
The anguish of mind is driving you insane

Don't ever loose your spark to light a raging fire
When you're about to pass the gates of the darker realms
You gotta keep it
You gotta keep it
To keep the ghosts
Keep the ghosts away from you

When the world sinks into bliss
You're falling deeper into the abyss
From the top of the mountain the you made from molehills

It haunts you it drowns you it chokes you it's eating your soul
The anguish of mind is driving you insane

Don't ever loose your spark to light a raging fire
When you're about to pass the gates of the darker realms
You gotta keep it
You gotta keep it
To keep the ghosts
Keep the ghosts away from you

It haunts you again
It drowns you again
It chokes you to death
It's eating your soul

Don't ever loose your spark to light a raging fire
When you're about to pass the gates of the darker realms
You gotta keep it
You gotta keep it
To keep the ghosts
Keep the ghosts away from you
