Destiny
Wherever you are taking me
Whatever you've arranged for me
I don't want your goodness for free
I wanna earn what I want

I will fight again
I will fail again
I will regret
I will forget
You surely know my name

Determination
Don't give in to deceleration
Don't ever lose your motivation
And perish in the aftershocks
Of dead predictions

I will fight again
I will fail again
I will regret
I will forget
You surely know my name

This is a war
The hunt is on
I am caught between

The devil and the deep blue sea
It's a battle of eternal grief
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
All you'll find is loss and fear

You're cold as stone
You're called

Agony
You really live up to your name
Your evil eyes watching me
Give me a moment of clarity
To end this fields of war

I will fight again
I will fail again
I will regret
I will forget
You surely know my name

This is a war
The hunt is on
I am caught between

The devil and the deep blue sea
It's a battle of eternal grief
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
All you'll find is loss and fear

Now welcome the battle with open arms
It's do or die!

This is a war
The hunt is on
So everything is alright again

Between the devil and the deep blue sea
It's a battle of eternal grief
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
All you'll find is loss and fear

All you'll find is loss and fear!!!
