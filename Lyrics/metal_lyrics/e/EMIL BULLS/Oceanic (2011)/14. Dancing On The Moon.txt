Were all cast in the same tragedy
Most of us never achieved
All lifetime a war
The clocks are ticking the seconds away
So were getting closer each day to our last curtain call

If I have one wish for fill
Tonight I wanna sing with you
No matter if we're out of tune
Tonight we land up dancin' dancin' dancin' on the moon

All the thoughts are running in circles again
What will we get in the end
We waitin' in dreamin'
All hopes are meltin' like ice in the sun
To undry like a whale in the sand
The sand of a lonesome dessert

If I have one wish for fill
Tonight I wanna sing with you
No matter if we're out of tune
Tonight we land up dancin' dancin' dancin' on the moon
Tonight I wanna sing with you
No matter if we're out of tune
Tonight we land up dancin' dancin' dancin' on the moon

Tonight we will break free
Tomorrow we'll be kings and queens
Forever they will sing about us

Oh tonight
Tonight I wanna sing with you
No matter if we're out of tune
Tonight we land up dancin' dancin' dancin' on the moon 
Tonight I wanna sing with you
No matter if we're out of tune
Tonight we land up dancin' dancin' dancin' on the moon
