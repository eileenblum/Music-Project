I slowly exsanguinate
Into an ocean of despair
Like a decomposing carcass
IÂ´m floating towards nowhere
Below the sharks are waiting for a feeding frenzy
IÂ´ll trick Â´em and escape
Like the great Houdini

Pandemonium is on warpath

Not tonight Josephine
My heart belongs to another
I know what I want and itÂ´s not you
Sleep tight Joseohine
This is a goodbye
I gotta go I gotta leave it all
IÂ´m gonna leave it all behind

IÂ´m crawling through the deserts
And the badlands of my world
My patience and dedication drown
In the quicksand of my soul
Above the vultures are waiting for my final heartbeat
IÂ´ll trick Â´em and escape
Â´Cause i still belive

Pandemonium is on warpath

Not tonight Josephine
...

Josephine what the hell happened to us
Josephine thereÂ´s an ocean between us
Josephine weÂ´re behind the eight ball
Josephine the writing is on the wall

I slowly exsanguinate
Into an ocean of despair
Like a decomposing carcass
IÂ´m floating towards nowhere
Floating nowhere
Nowhere
Josephine

Josephine
My heart belongs to another
I know what I want and itÂ´s not you
Sleep tight Josephine
This is a goodbye
Bye bye
