Let me inspire your desire to be devoted and live wired
Let me inspire your desire don't you ever loose the fire
Always
Come with the power of the sun
Like a well oiled machine
On revolutionary roads
Be sure to know which way the wind blows
(All systems go now)
Keep heart and soul sincere
And mind crystal clear
Now

Go go go all systems go
Go all systems go go go
If you're not into this (kid)
You can kiss my ass

You are drowning in search of somewhere in nowhere
Get it together get focused get ready
Stop digging for gold with a blindfold on
Come into the sun

Let me inspire your desire to be devoted and live wired
Let me inspire your desire don't you ever loose the fire
Always
Be a slave of your passion
Stay true to yourself
Improve and refine
(That's the way it goes)
Keep your eyes open watch and learn
(All systems go now)
Don't hesitate accept a dare
Act ever fair and square

Go go go all systems go
Go all systems go go go
If you're not into this (kid)
You can kiss my ass

You are drowning in search of somewhere in nowhere
Get it together get focused get ready
Stop digging for gold with a blindfold on
Come into the sun

Dullness and despair are your company
When you live your life in vacuity
Dullness and despair are the enemy
Hang 'em high hang 'em high

You are drowning in search of somewhere in nowhere
Get it together get focused get ready
Stop digging for gold with a blindfold on
Come into the sun

(All systems go now)
