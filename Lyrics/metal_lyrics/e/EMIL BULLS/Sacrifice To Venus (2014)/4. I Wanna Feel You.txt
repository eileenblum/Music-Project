Thank god you came
And took this heavy burden from my soul
Every fiber of my body feels release
You found me walking trough a haze
I was gonna lose my way
You lead me back to walk the line
I was blind now I can see
You are my favorite dance to me

I feel like I can fly
You illuminate the darkest nights
I never felt this way
(You make me wanna dance
all over the town tonight)
(I wanna feel you)
Feel your heartbeat next to mine
(I wanna feel that)
Youâre mine

Thank god you came
Before I past the point of no return
And burned down all the bridges to my past
Youâve seen me falling from grace
You put my dignity back in place
You lead me back to walk the line
I was blind now I can see
You are my favorite dance to me

I feel like I can fly
You illuminate the darkest nights
I never felt this way
(You make me wanna dance
all over the town tonight)
(I wanna feel you)
Feel your heartbeat next to mine
(I wanna feel that)
Youâre mine

I feel like I can fly
You illuminate the darkest nights
I never felt this way
You make me wanna dance
all over the town tonight

I feel like I can fly
You illuminate the darkest nights
I never felt this way
(I wanna dance all over the town tonight)
(I wanna feel you)
Feel your heartbeat next to mine
(I wanna feel that)
Youâre mine
