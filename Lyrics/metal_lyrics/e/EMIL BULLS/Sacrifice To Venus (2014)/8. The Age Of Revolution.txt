This is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
Oh, This is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
Oh, This is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit

If we go down
We go down together
Family means family forever
All for one and one for all
Come hell or high water
We stand tall
In the age of revolution we're a unit
This is our live
This is our passion
You can't ruin it
We won't give in
You gotta bite the bullet
There's the wrong way
The right way and the way we do it
Our hearts beat as one
No one can hold us down
We come in peace this ain't no war
This is passion
This is love

Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit

We will smiley
We will shine together
Our legacy will remain forever
Conflagrations and revelations
Of timeless beauty
And pure sensation
To strive seek find and not to yield
Is our device on life's battlefield
We are the world
And we are everything in it
We are the power
The stamina and the team spirit
Our hearts beat as one
No one can hold us down
We come in peace
This ain't no war
This is passion
This is love

Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit

We're not afraid
As long as the sun burns
And the earth turns
Love and hate flirt
As long as pain hurts
As long as blood is thicker than water
And our hope knows no borders
As long as the moon is doomed in gloom
And the barflies find their womb
As long as destiny writes its own tragedies
And life and death are sworn enemies
We're not afraid of anything

Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
(Come sing with me)
Oh, this is how we do it
(This is how we do it)
In the age of revolution we're a unit
(No one can hold us down)
Oh, this is how we do it
(Yes, this is how we do it)
In the age of revolution we're a unit
(Come on, come on sing along)
Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
Oh, this is how we do it
In the age of revolution we're a unit
