We've been denied, disgraced
We've been locked away
We've been forsaken and betrayed
By the ones we loved
They've tried to flush us down the drain
They left us out in the rain
We've been shattered by pain
Time and Time again

We swallowed our tears
And we suffered in silence
Beyond the pain
The dwarfs became giants

We are strong (invincible)
We are lions (unbreakable)
We were born to be fighters (unterrified)
We rise, we rise
And while you stare at your burning home
We walk the way of the warrior
Hear our battle call

We'll take over it all
Ripe for attack

We walk trough fire
We're not afraid of what may come
We've become unbreakable
We're stronger than the sun
We're not ashamed of our scars
We front the demons of our past
Under the shelter of the shield
Only unity can breed

We swallowed our tears
And we suffered in silence
Beyond the pain
The dwarfs became giants

We are strong (invincible)
We are lions (unbreakable)
We were born to be fighters (unterrified)
We rise, we rise
And while you stare at your burning home
We walk the way of the warrior
Hear our battle call

Invincible
Unbreakable
Unterrified
We rise, we rise

Invincible
Unbreakable
Unterrified
We rise, we rise

We are strong (invincible)
We are lions (unbreakable)
We were born to be fighters (unterrified)
We rise, we rise
And while you stare at your burning home
We walk the way of the warrior
Hear our battle call

We are strong
We are lions (We'll take over it all)
We were born to be fighters
(Take over it all)
And while you stare at your burning home
(We'll take over it all)
We walk the way of the warrior
Hear our battle call

We'll take over it all
Ripe for attack
