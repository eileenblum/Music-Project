We are ready for blood
We are driven by hunger
We're the meanest and the badest animal in the jungle
With every breath we take we bring armageddon
We're night's parasites, we were born in the shadows

Hungry and lonely we're crying at the moon
Real life don't fit in boxes and speech balloons

We don't give a shit 'bout rainbows and butterflies
We fuck your elves and unicorns doggy style
It's too sad that we gotta burst your bubble
But neverland is in serious trouble
We don't give a shit 'bout rainbows and butterflies
We fuck your elves and unicorns doggy style
Wake up, stop living in a fairytale
Make way for the beasts of prey

It's the flawless flesh that drives us out of the den
The scent of wild innocence is carried on the wind
All light must pass when the beast is unleashed
The wolf meets the sheep for a fancy feast

Hungry and lonely we're crying at the moon
Real life don't fit in boxes and speech balloons

We don't give a shit 'bout rainbows and butterflies
We fuck your elves and unicorns doggy style
It's too sad that we gotta burst your bubble
But neverland is in serious trouble
We don't give a shit 'bout rainbows and butterflies
We fuck your elves and unicorns doggy style
Wake up, stop living in a fairytale
Make way for the beasts of prey

We are, we are the spawn of the night
We outshine the light
We make the sun go down
We are, we are the beat of your heart
A breathtaking drug
We bring you back to life

Open the gates of the night
We rise when daylight dies
We rise when daylight dies

We don't give a shit 'bout rainbows and butterflies
We fuck your elves and unicorns doggy style
It's too sad that we gotta burst your bubble
But neverland is in serious trouble
We don't give a shit 'bout rainbows and butterflies
We fuck your elves and unicorns doggy style
Wake up, stop living in a fairytale
Make way for the beasts of prey
We don't give a shit
