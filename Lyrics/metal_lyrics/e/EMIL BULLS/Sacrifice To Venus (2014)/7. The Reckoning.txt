This is the reckoning
This is the reckoning

Welcome to the Terrordome
Come on in
And make yourself at home
Take a seat in the front row
Lean back and enjoy the show
Trough fire and hurricanes
I'm gonna take this to my grave
I won't show no weakness
I'll keep it a secret
As god is my witness

I'll see you in hell again
So sweet
Is the sin, bitter is the end
I just paid the ferryman
To send you to hell
This is my farewell
Let freedom ring
When your death bell tolls
This is the reckoning
This is the reckoning

Thanks to the fucked up things you've done
They've just inspired another song
A song like a thunderstorm
A song as lethal as a gun
Trough fire and hurricanes
I'm gonna take this to my grave
I won't show no weakness
I'll keep it a secret
As god is my witness

I'll see you in in hell again
So sweet
Is the sin, bitter is the end
I just paid the ferryman
To send you to hell
This is my farewell
Let freedom ring
When your death bell tolls
This is the reckoning
This is the reckoning

Goodbye, my concubine
Sleep tight, perfidy

Let freedom ring
When your death bell tolls
Sweet is the sin, bitter is the end
Let freedom ring
When your death bell tolls

I'll see you in in hell again
So sweet
Is the sin, bitter is the end
I just paid the ferryman
To send you to hell
This is my farewell
Let freedom ring
When your death bell tolls
This is the reckoning
This is the reckoning

Goodbye, my concubine
Sleep tight, perfidy
