Let's get it straight from the start
I'm gonna break your heart
Tear it apart like a bloodthirsty shark
The never ending struggle against
Unwillingness and stupidity
Has taken all my wartime dignity

I am not a poet, I'm a drunk with a pen
The words it puts on paper
Are on fire with hate
Thank god drunkenness can be sobered
But stupid lasts forever
Now I will show you the meaning of forever
The friend in me awoke from sleep
I pray the beast my soul to keep
My heart is a tomb
What's dead may never die
This is the time to erase and rewind

You can never fuck,
Never suck my pride out of my penis
I leave you dying away
My sacrifice to venus

You can never fuck,
Never suck my pride out of my penis
I leave you dying away
My sacrifice to venus
Dying away my sacrifice to venus

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

I'm gonna settle this once and for all
Before I fall apart
And collapse like a house of cards
My future life will never know
You existed at all
I'll wipe you out
Like an cannon ball

I'm not a saint, I am beyond the sinner
Tragedy is the only winner
There's no peace without war
There's no love without drama
In the end we all suck the cock of karma
The friend in me awoke from sleep
I pray the beast my soul to keep
My heart is a tomb
What's dead may never die
This is the time to erase and rewind

You can never fuck,
Never suck my pride out of my penis
I leave you dying away
My sacrifice to venus

You can never fuck,
Never suck my pride out of my penis
I leave you dying away
My sacrifice to venus
Dying away my sacrifice to venus

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Fucking bleed, fucking bleed
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed
An Ocean

I'll rip your heart out and feed it to the fire
I'll watch you burn
Watch it burn

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Don't you cry, don't you cry me a river
Don't you think I deserve something bigger
Fucking bleed, fucking bleed me an ocean
Of love, lust and devotion

Fucking bleed
An ocean
