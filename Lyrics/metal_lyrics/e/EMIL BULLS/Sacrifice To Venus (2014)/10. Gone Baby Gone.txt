When I reflected the love?
I feel disgrace
'Cause I'm thinking of you
In the first place
When you known you've
Destroyed something beautiful
You just falling to ashes
From the afterglow

The seasons change
But the song remains the same

Gone baby gone
You're gone forever but still
I remember you
Why does a river its ?
It's been many
Many moons are gone
I'm still drowning in the
Dark waters far from shore

I satan in ocean full of secrets
In search of places for my weakness
My heart has turning to a shack of sin
Stay awake 'cause it's all about to cave in

The seasons change
But the song remains the same

Gone baby gone
You're gone forever but still
I remember you
Why does a river its ?
It's been many
Many moons are gone
I'm still drowning in the
Dark waters far from shore

I still remember you
Why does a river

Gone baby gone
You're gone forever but still
I remember you
Why does a river its ?
It's been many
Many moons are gone
I'm still drowning in the
Dark waters far from shore

Gone baby gone
You're gone forever but still
I remember you
Why does a river its ?
It's been many
Many moons are gone
I'm still drowning in the
Dark waters far from shore

I still remember you
Why does a river
