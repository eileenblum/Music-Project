Yeah
Fire shall be woken
To fix the plan that have been broken
Replace the souls of "I believes"
In the name of our dreams
We gonna move mountains with our faith
An empty ?? has gone astray
Until sinners we make our selfs believe
We can walk on water in times of these
Go

Light up the darkness with a smile on your face
Destroy your feeling of hope on the streams of hate
Now you're a slayer for ??
A fury to the rage
We break the chains
Escape the cage
???
???
We will kill, we will kill until we drown
We'll be the fear the fear that will drown
We will go down in history
And you will be a burning, burning sorry

Burn, Burn, Burning burning sorry
Burn, Burn, Burning burning sorry

Keep on dreaming
Keep on believing
Just keep breathing
No matter how your heart is screaming
Never give up
Never back down
To we you must attack
(You must attack)
The world will drag you down
So fire 'till your heart stops beating

To the mother ... child
To the last ...
To the last who is caught in fire
... spark wire

We will kill, we will kill until we drown
We'll be the fear the fear that will drown
We will go down in history
And you will be a burning, burning sorry

Burn, Burn, Burning burning sorry
Burn, Burn, Burning burning sorry

Keep on dreaming
Keep on believing
Just keep breathing
No matter how your heart is screaming
Never give up
Never back down
To we you must attack
(You must attack)
The world will drag you down
So fire 'till your heart stops beating

Keep on dreaming
Keep on believing
Just keep breathing
No matter how your heart is screaming
Never give up
Never back down
To we you must attack
(You must attack)
The world will drag you down
So fire 'till your heart stops beating

Keep on dreaming
Keep on believing
Just keep breathing
No matter how your heart is screaming
Never give up
Never back down
To we you must attack
(You must attack)
The world will drag you down
So fire 'till your heart stops beating
