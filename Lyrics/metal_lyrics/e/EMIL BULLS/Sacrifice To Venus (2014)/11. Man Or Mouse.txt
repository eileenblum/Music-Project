Do you wanna be a man or do you wanna be a mouse
Do you wanna be a hero, do you wanna be a clown
Do you wanna be a lion, do you wanna be a flea
We are who we chose to be
Do you wanna be a coward, do you wanna be a brave
Do you wanna be a master, do you wanna be the slave
Do you wanna be a giver, do you wanna be a thief
We are who we choose to be

Hands up, hands up, everybody sing
We don't wanna be controlled like a puppet on a string
Hands up, hands up, everybody sing
We don't know how to follow, we're the ones that always lead

If you wanna be remembered
If you wanna be unique
Extraordinary is the way you have to live
Here we go
Boom! Boom! Here comes the knights
Our legend will never die
We are undeniable
We won't stop until we're done
Eyes wide and open mouthed
The world will see us rise
We are the restless ones
We'll never stop for anyone

Do you wanna be a man or do you wanna be a mouse
Do you wanna be a hero, do you wanna be a clown

Hands up, hands up, everybody sing
We don't wanna be controlled like a puppet on a string
Hands up, hands up, everybody sing
We don't know how to follow, we're the ones that always lead
