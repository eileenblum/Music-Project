How do you do, how do you do dear sadness
feels good to have you around again

to love is to suffer, to love is to let go
to love is to lose control
it's been a while
since we shared our thoughts
I'm pleased you came back to remind me not to forget

I'm glad you came over to talk to me
I'm glad you remember me
so come and dismember me
dismember me
here I am

how do you do, how do you do dear sadness
feels good to have you around again
how do you do, how do you do dear sadness
feels good to have you around again

love wears a halo
love is like the snow
pure like a virgin, sometimes below zero
like a wolf eating chalk
mild and meek
it covers the footsteps of deceit

how do you do, how do you do dear sadness
feels good to have you around again
how do you do, how do you do dear sadness
feels good to have you around again

(don't ever go, don't ever go, don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone)
I'm glad you came over to talk to me
I'm glad you remember me
so come and dismember me
dismember me
here I am

come on, let's take a stroll
through the morgue of my soul
I wanna show you
the place god has left long ago
It's time to find our way down to the bowels of hell
I wanna show you where my ghosts and my demons dwell
