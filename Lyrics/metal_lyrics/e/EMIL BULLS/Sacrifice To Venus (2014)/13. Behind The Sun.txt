Meet me where the dark lives
At the end of the light
Just lay your hand in my hand
Feels good to know you're mine
You will never float alone
I won't let you down
Don't you fear the unknown
It will take your breath away
Fair and beautiful
Where your dreams come true

I wanna kiss you goodnight, baby
I wanna kiss you goodbye, baby
Kiss you one last time, baby
Before the planets collide, baby

We're hiding behind the sun
Forever and ever and ever
An endless pitch black hole
Forever and ever and ever

Meet me where the light dies
Where blackness prevails
Immerse into the silence
Close your eyes and drift away
Take as long as you need
We can make the moment last
We escape the past
In the vastness of eternity
Where no time exists
We'll find our bliss

I wanna kiss you goodnight, baby
I wanna kiss you goodbye, baby
Kiss you one last time, baby
Before the planets collide, baby

We're hiding behind the sun
Forever and ever and ever
An endless pitch black hole
Forever and ever and ever

We are hiding behind the sun
Forever and ever and ever
An endless pitch black hole
Forever and ever and ever
