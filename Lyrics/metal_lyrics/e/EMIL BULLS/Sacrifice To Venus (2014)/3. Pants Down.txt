We're gonna party with our pants down
we're gonna paint this town in every color
mother earth created for us
we're gonna party with our pants down
we're gonna paint this town in every color
mother earth created for us
we're gonna party with our pants down,
party with our pants down,party with our
pants down
party with our pants down

come on just have a fling
let's get in the ring
make way to hall the kings
our rock'n'roll is in full swing
we are the toast of the town
guess who wears the crown
a strike of lightning
and we punch with the impact of tyson

finally come alive
now everybody sing
we're gonna party with our pants down
we're gonna paint this town in every color
mother earth created for us
we're gonna party with our pants down,
party with our pants down,party with our
pants down
party with our pants down

you can never tame
the heroes of this game
we're a tornado crushing all inside the hall of fame
we're the magic Johnsons
we send you over jordan
the Dr: J's enema
will flush away your boredom

finally come alive
now everybody sing
we're gonna party with our pants down
we're gonna paint this town in every color
mother earth created for us
we're gonna party with our pants down,
party with our pants down,party with our
pants down
party with our pants down

you talk it, we live it, you're jealous, admit it finally come alive

we're gonna party with our pants down
we're gonna paint this town in every color
mother earth created for us
we're gonna party with our pants down,
party with our pants down,party with our
pants down
party with our pants down
we're gonna party with our pants down,
pants down
we're gonna party with our pants down,
pants down
we're gonna party with our pants down,
party with our pants down
party with our pants down, party with our
pants down
