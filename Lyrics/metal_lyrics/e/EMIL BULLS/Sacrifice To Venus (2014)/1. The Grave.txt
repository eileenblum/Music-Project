No one can clean up the mess we left
we fucked it up

IÂ´m scared of what this all became
armageddon is just hours away

where has all our conscience gone
brainwashing and fanaticism
the age of man comes crashing down
saber rattling and antagonism

take me to another galaxy, maybe IÂ´ll find
some peace light years away from here
planet earth is just not good for me,
IÂ´m going home
I say goodbye to this tragedy

we reamain in our wasted state of mind
five minutes to midnight

where has all our conscience gone
brainwashing and fanaticism
the age of man comes crashing down
saber rattling and antagonism

take me to another galaxy, maybe IÂ´ll find
some peace light years away from here
planet earth is just not good for me,
IÂ´m going home
I say goodbye to this tragedy

we all reached a new level of depravity
we remain in our wasted state of mind
five minutes to midnight
weÂ´re just starring at our grave
weÂ´re just starring at our grave

take me to another galaxy, maybe IÂ´ll find
some peace light years away from here
planet earth is just not good for me,
IÂ´m going home
I say goodbye to this tragedy
IÂ´m going home
