I have driven rusty nails deep into this love
You're so right it's all my fault

Trust me
I lie to girls to save this paranoid love affair
I've pushed my luck again

Now it's time for a radical change
'Cause IÂ´m about to break down
The mental war machine creeps on
Little strokes fell big oaks
It's like starring on the clock that tells
Time is threatening your life
I implode and explode

You destroy the thing you love
No, it's the other way around
What you love destroys you
You keep on thinking it's your fault
I swear next time I have to choose
I'll choose myself
Maybe I'm fine when IÂ´m alone

I'll push my luck again and again
