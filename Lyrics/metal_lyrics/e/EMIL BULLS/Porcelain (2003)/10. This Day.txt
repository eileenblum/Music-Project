All play and no work makes Christ a dull boy
His life's a misty lane
IÂ´m waiting for the night to come
IÂ´m waiting for the spots to shine
I invite all my friends to be part of this dream

Tonight something extraordinary is possible
There's no right or wrong to our way
This day is mine this day is yours
Take a deep breath - it'll blow your mind
Sample the moment - loop it again
Tape this day and rewind it

I know you never get enough... ha... are you ready... let's go

Come feel the blood rush into your head
The sound it creates in your ears
We're gonna dance tonight - for sure
We'll get our curtain call - once more
Yes tonight we're the boys with the most cake and toys
