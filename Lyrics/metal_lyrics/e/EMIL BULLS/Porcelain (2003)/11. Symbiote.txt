I'm watching over you
We stick together like glue
Even when you're dead and gone
I'll live on you

I'm your parasite you're my host come feed me
I'm the parasite gimme more gimme more
I breathe you in I breath you out
Feed me make me dream about
Sill being nurtured by you next summer... girl

Don't waste your time and try to leave
IÂ´ll track you down at every turn
Watch the lump under your skin
Guess who's living within

Me the parasite inside your skin
You the host that takes me in
Me the parasite inside your skin
You the host that takes me in
Parasite... I am god
Parasite... I am god
