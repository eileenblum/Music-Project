Please don't stop moving
Keep your body on grooving
A thousand shivers are crawling
Smooth and slow
Up and down your spine

I wish that I could give you everything you die for... or maybe more
You're made of my wildest dreams and you save my cells from dying

Sex in slow motion
A lonely bird over the ocean
The grace of a feather
Dancing with the wind to the end of this world... weightless

I wish that I could give you everything you die for... or maybe more
You're made of my wildest dreams and you save my cells from dying
I hope you feel the same way

Handle love with kid gloves
We were on fire baby
Lost in lust and love
We left the world behind
But then it all stopped
