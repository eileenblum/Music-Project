Now all my people come on ... whatever gets you off... you will find it here
Now all the things become crystal clear
You're the sucker and I'm the god in here
Take a look at this world she's smiling at me
I dance with angels on my way to hell
No I won't sing about summer and love
'Cause tonight it all turns into a winter of hate ... cold
I left the earth when the cold wind came
I saw a darkness along lover's lane
Oh when the drugs began to take hold
I heard cash playing "I'm leaving now"
