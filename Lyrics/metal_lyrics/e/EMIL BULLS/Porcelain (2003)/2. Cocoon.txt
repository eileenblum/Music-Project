Here all our wounds can heal
Scars and blisters disappear
We're safe just as long as we stay

In this cocoon I melt away with you
Oh yeah in this cocoon no one can disturb
Our dreams our eternal sleep

Yes here love takes root and it grows
Adrenaline and dopamine begin to flow
We're one just as long as we stay
