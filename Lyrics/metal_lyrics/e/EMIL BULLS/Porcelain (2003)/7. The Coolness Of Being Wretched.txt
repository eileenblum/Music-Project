Whiskey vine dope stale cigarette smoke mud blood beer
Stale cigarette smoke...
I'm so mean I make medicine sick alright
Don't waste all my batteries killer of my fantasies
I'm drowning taking hold of me
I'm loosing my grip on reality

I've lost all my fantasies
And I've got the vigor of a five second porno stream

A monster creeps inside of me
It's sucking all my energy
I'm aching for serenity
Corrosion of mind takes hold of me

I've lost all my fantasies
And I've got the vigor of a five second porno stream
Deteriorated to the level of a dumb beast
I beg your pardon but that's the real me

I'm so mean and evil I make medicine sick
A fool creep burning effigy
Behaving rudimentary
Makes it all easy
Makes living easy

Whiskey vine dope stale cigarette smoke mud blood and beer
I'm so mean I make medicine sick alright
