Your phone calls send me from heaven to hell
I never thought that such a sweet voice could cause so much harm
Please stop saying that you love me

Don't fuck with me

The golden sun will shine 
In my own world tonight 
I'll ride a comet through the skies 
I'll forget about life for a while

IÂ´m always wrapped up in the world of my own
It's impossible through words to describe 
What I feel what I fear I'm up shit creek 
I just have no kick left 

There are no mistakes just happy little accidents 
There are no mistakes just happy little accidents
Nothing is ever for sure that's the only sure thing I do know
But my love is for real 
There are no mistakes just happy little accidents
My love's for real
