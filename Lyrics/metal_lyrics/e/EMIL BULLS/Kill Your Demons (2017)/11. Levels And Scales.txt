I'm on the verge of breaking
Waking up into a nightmare day by day
Stuck in a void
Standing on the shards of chaos
Trying to figure out the map of my life below
Don't do this to me mind
Wanna be free from worry
Wanna be free from regret
Wanna live
Wanna love
Wanna be
Wanna laugh
Wanna breath
Wanna float
Wanna be weightless
And feel the molecules I'm made of
Let it go let it go let it go now
Before it takes control
Let it go let it go let it go now
March with your dreams they're more than you see
Let it go let it go let it go now
Before you lose it all
Let it go let it go let it go now
March with your dreams they're more than you see
So much more than you can see
More than levels and scales
I sleep with one eye open
Can't run away can't escape my days gone gray
Do you think it's funny
Standing at the crossroads
The ownership of my sanity is gone in woe
Why are you doing this to me mind
Wanna be free from worry
Wanna be free from regret
Wanna live
Wanna love
Wanna be
Wanna laugh
Wanna breath
Wanna float
Wanna be weightless
And feel the molecules I'm made of
Let it go let it go let it go now
Before it takes control
Let it go let it go let it go now
March with your dreams they're more than you see
Let it go let it go let it go now
Before you lose it all
Let it go let it go let it go now
March with your dreams they're more than you see
So much more than you can see
More than levels and scales
