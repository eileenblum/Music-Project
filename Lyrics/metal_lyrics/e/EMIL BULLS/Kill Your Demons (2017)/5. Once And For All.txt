Dig your hate a deep and an early grave
Find an exit from the path of blame
We all fail we all fall we all tell the same lies
All sickness of mind clad in perfect disguise
Don't you ever forget
We're all greater than hate
We're all from the same blood
Born from water and mud
Stand together stand tall
Here's it once and for all
We're all from the same blood
Born from water and mud
Paved together hearts tall
Here's it once and for all
Still the biggest curse is to forget
Help all those who shovel their regrets
Surrounded by fools and the idiot's mind
The purpose of life just withers and dies
Don't you ever forget
We're all greater than hate
We're all from the same blood
Born from water and mud
Stand together stand tall
Here's it once and for all
We're all from the same blood
Born from water and mud
Paved together hearts tall
Here's it once and for all
Once and for all
Once for all
