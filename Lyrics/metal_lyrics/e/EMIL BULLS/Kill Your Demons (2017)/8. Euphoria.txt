They say you
That you're just a feeling
But for me
You are the reason

You make my blood run wild, you make me come alive
From here to dawn you take me to the highest highs

I wanna feel glorious.
I wanna take you out euphoria.

Euphoria Euphoria
Give me the kicks
Euphoria Euphoria
Don't ever missed you
Euphoria Euphoria
Take away our phobia

Euphoria Euphoria
Give me the kicks
Euphoria Euphoria
Don't ever missed you
Euphoria hey
Euphoria ho
Euphoria hey

They say you
You favoured the first you
But I know
You linger in argue

I always follow you wherever you may roam
I'm on track with you as ready set and go

I wanna feel glorious
I wanna take you out euphoria

Euphoria Euphoria
Give me the kicks
Euphoria Euphoria
Don't ever missed you
Euphoria Euphoria
Take away our phobia

Euphoria Euphoria
Give me the kicks
Euphoria Euphoria
Don't ever missed you
Euphoria hey
Euphoria ho
Euphoria hey

Euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria

Euphoria Euphoria
Give me the kicks
Euphoria Euphoria
Don't ever missed you
Euphoria Euphoria
Take away our phobia

Euphoria Euphoria
Give me the kicks
Euphoria Euphoria
Don't ever missed you
Euphoria hey
Euphoria ho
Euphoria hey
