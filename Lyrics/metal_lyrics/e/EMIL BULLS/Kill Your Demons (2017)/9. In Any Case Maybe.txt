Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everybody wake up
Everybody wake up
Now
We feast from the horn of plenty
In the age of hedonistic frenzy
We got 1, 2, 3 million wishes
We got 4, 5, 6 credit cards
We exploit all mines of diamonds
We deny they're drenched in blood
Drenched in blood
We've lost class and grace
It's greed we embrace
We dwell in a haze
Generation "In any case maybe"
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everybody wake up
Everybody wake up
Now
That the barrels are all empty
And our craze
Is coming to an ending
We got 1, 2, 3 million stories
We got 4, 5, 6 alibis
You know 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Ain't no login code to heaven
For heaven's sake
We've lost class and grace
It's greed we embrace
We dwell in a haze
Generation "In any case maybe"
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everything's now
Everything's outta control
Everybody wake up
Everybody wake up
