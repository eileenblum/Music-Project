Beware the gates to the harlot's house
They lure you in they spit you out
Make desire arise
You'll feel mesmerized
And just like that you are demonized
Demonized
Demonized
They suck you in the eye of the storm of your mind
They creep up from behind they take you by surprise
They leave you hypnotized
They come in gorgeous disguise
They feign paradise
They make desire arise
Temptation sweet as sin
Don't let the sirens suck you in
Come kill kill kill
Kill your demons
And all illusions of fail die down
Demonized
Demonized
They take you for a ride
No crave is satisfied
They make you wanna snap they make you wanna spin
They skin you from within
Don't let them diminish your rise
Unveil all their lies
Silence their beckoning cries
Temptation sweet as sin
Don't let the sorrow suck you in
Come kill kill kill
Kill your demons
They'll disappear
If you don't surrender to frights and fears
Just kill kill kill
Kill your demons
And all illusions of fail die down
