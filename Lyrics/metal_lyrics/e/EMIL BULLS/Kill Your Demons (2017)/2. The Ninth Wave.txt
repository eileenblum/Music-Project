(Watch out)
She's freakin' murderous by trade
(It's us)
She comes to swallow the plague
(It's on)
The beast is ravenous like insane
(It's now)
Save youself but you can't

(Sink, sink, sink or swim)
Sink or swim
She's crashing in
She's draggin you down, down, down!
Savage is her hideous heart
Her hideous heart
She was born to use it all

Sink or swim
She's crashing in
She's draggin you down, down, down!
Savage is her hideous heart
Her hideous heart
She'll wipe out every one of us

Be aware cause the waters are rising
The calm's breaking the sirens so silent
Blown strong by the venomous winds
Look what infliction she brings

(Watch out)
She's freakin' murderous by trade
(It's us)
She comes to swallow the plague
(It's on)
The beast is ravenous like insane
(It's now)
Save youself but you can't

Sink or swim
She's crashing in
She's draggin you down, down, down!
Savage is her hideous heart
Her hideous heart
She'll wipe out every one of us

Sink or swim
She's crashing in
Save yourself but you can't

Sink or swim
She's crashing in
She's draggin you down, down, down!
Savage is her hideous heart
Her hideous heart
She'll wipe out every one of us
