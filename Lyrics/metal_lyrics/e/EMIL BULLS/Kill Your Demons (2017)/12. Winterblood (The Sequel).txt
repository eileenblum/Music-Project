Here I hibernate in my little cave
Stitched up my wounds
All the scars they begin to fade
Here I'm safe and sound
Bliss is all around
I'm gonna show the old me
My new feeding ground
I've soothed beneath
A new dawn has been crowned
No you're not crying a river
You're fucking bleeding an ocean
I fought endless bottles to finally win this battle
After losing it all I found a place to settle
Sometimes my memories are getting in my way
Then I meet you down there but hey that's OK
Just one drink and I send you your merry way
No you're not crying a river
You're fucking bleeding an ocean
And you bleed
God you bleed
Yes you bleed winterblood
Winterblood
