I've always been a fighter
Always been a smiter
Now I come for you
Striking like a lightning
See my claws are tightening
Just too quick for you
I'll never crouch
I'll never crawl
I'll never turn away
I will dig and I will delve
Until I have my way
Duck and cover everyone
Here I come
Duck and cover everyone
Here I come
I am hate I am the plague you cannot heal
I'm the anatomy epitome of fear
I'm a shapeshifter I am you
I dismantle the sun what's new
I've always been a slasher
Always been a dasher
Don't you come to close
I'll break you in an instant
Snap you it's my instinct
That's the way it goes
I am the might
I claim my right
That's how I feed my greed
I will cull and I will kill
Grinning as you bleed
Duck and cover everyone
Here I come
Duck and cover everyone
Here I come
I am hate I am the plague you cannot heal
I'm the anatomy epitome of fear
I'm a shapeshifter I am you
I dismantle the sun what's new
I'm a shapeshifter I am you
I am hate and we are through
I'm the plague you cannot heal
I'm the anatomy of fear and I am real
Run fast run far
Run fast run far
Run fast run far
Run fast
