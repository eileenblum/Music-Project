As I ride into the sunset
Cross the fields of gold
There's nothing I fear
I'm all in control
I'm the ground zero of my kind
I feel life in every vein
A galaxy in my eyes
And a universe in mind
I have lied to you
Lied to you
But I swear
I'll walk out of this
A better wiser man
I'm falling away from you
I'm falling away from you
A galaxy in my eyes
A universe in my mind
Arise dear spring
And kill the envious doom
Arise dear spring
I was a lost and drunken sailor
On the sea of sweet and sin
I cast my boat on every river
And let the sirens suck me in
Had no more aces in my hand
To save my castles made of sand
A galaxy of lies
A universe of vice
I have lied to you
Lied to you
But I swear
I'll walk out of this
A better wiser man
I'm falling away from you
I'm falling away from you
A galaxy in my eyes
A universe in my mind
Arise dear spring
And kill the envious doom
Arise dear spring
