I don't need you love
Don't wanna feel you love
My heart has lost every spark
I don't breathe you love
Don't wanna bleed you love
My soul is a cluster of coal
And so I've gone dark
My reflection shows black
A lot of history in these walls
Thank god they cannot talk no
I opened every door
Every hallway I have walked
I've seen hearts hit the floor
And get shaken to the core
Through greed betrayal and revenge
Darkness I became
I don't need you love
Don't wanna feel you love
My heart has lost every spark
(No I don't need you love)
I don't breathe you love
Don't wanna bleed you love
My soul is a cluster of coal
And so I've gone dark
My reflection shows black
The solutions for it all were right in my face yes
I've lost pride and grace
'Cause my eyes were everywhere else
And so the heavy sun got dark
Bearing blisters bearing scars
Through greed betrayal and revenge
Darkness I became
I don't need you love
Don't wanna bleed you love
My heart has lost every spark
(No I don't need you love)
I don't breathe you love
Don't wanna bleed you love
My soul is a cluster of coal
And so I've gone dark
My reflection shows black
