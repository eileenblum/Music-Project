Bring me a drink to cool down all my thirsty thoughts
The pictures in my head yearn for revelation
The scenes I create tainted in sensation
The lust to unlace craves from within
Her sway and her strut just promise sin
She moves me like a hungry rhythm
I'll be damned if she ain't on a mission
Should I move should I act should I get close to her
Or finish up pay my tab and escape the blur
Drip drip dripping poison
Dripping poison and flaming lust
Miss Magnetic, Miss Magnetic
What are you doing to me
I cannot move
I'm feeling static
Catch my eyes as you please
Miss Magnetic, Miss Magnetic
What are you doing to me
I am helpless
I am an addict
Addicts are never free
What are you doing to me
Curious to see how far desire bends me
Really wanna see anticipation set free
To hell with hesitation I put my biggest bet in
And go for a swim in the sea of sin
I'm going all in there's no riddle
Ain't the type who moves little by little
She pulls she attracts like a magnet force
She toys she repels and her door is closed
Drip drip dripping poison
Dripping poison and flaming lust
Miss Magnetic, Miss Magnetic
What are you doing to me
I cannot move
I'm feeling static
Catch my eyes as you please
Miss Magnetic, Miss Magnetic
What are you doing to me
I am helpless
I am an addict
Addicts are never free
What are you doing to me
