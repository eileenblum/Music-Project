Here we go again
All the world shall know
This is our play
This is our show
We turn every flicker to a flame
We brave every storm
We're the ace of the game
The ace of the game
Here we go again
Dressed in flames
Dressed in flames
We set sail into the fray
Dressed in flames
Dressed in flames
Once more into the fray
Let's roll again
Haven't you been told
This is our mine
This is our gold
We ride the tempest it's no deal
Our promise is honest
It's etched in steel
Etched in steel
Here we go again
Dressed in flames
Dressed in flames
We set sail into the fray
Dressed in flames
Dressed in flames
Once more into the fray
We roll in we don't slack
It's a quake and a smack
We're riding the temptest 'til the morning dawns
Bathed in fire and flames from its blaze we're spawned
