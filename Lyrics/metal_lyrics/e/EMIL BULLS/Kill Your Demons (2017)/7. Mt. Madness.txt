I cut the rope
It should have been predicted
Now we are afflicted
The path is unfortified
We should have been addicted
Now we are evicted
Stumbling on crumbling ice
This summit kills all sanity
It sucks the air we breathe
Like a rope team in a storm
So beaten and forlorn
We're running out of oxygen
I climbed Mount Madness
And Mount Sadness for you
Astray and lost in a whiteout
To save myself I cut the rope
God I cut cut cut the rope
Our lies have been convicted
Truth has been depicted
The writing is on the wall
Deep wounds have been inflicted
Cut open tried to zip it
Time has taken toll
I cut the rope with the same knife
That disemboweled me
Change is the law of love and life
Look how I'm climbing free
I'm breathing new oxygen
I climbed Mount Madness
And Mount Madness for you
Astray and lost in a whiteout
To save myself I cut the rope
God I cut cut cut the rope
Mount Madness and Mount Sadness for you
Astray and lost in a whiteout
Astray and lost on Mount Madness
Mount Sadness
And watch you fall
Into calamity's gorges
I watch you fall
As you shatter to pieces
I cut the rope and I watch you fall
Into calamity's gorges
I watch you fall
As you shatter to pieces
I climbed Mount Madness and Mount Sadness for you
Astray and lost in a whiteout
To save myself I cut the rope
God I cut cut cut the rope
Mount Madness and Mount Sadness for you
Astray and lost in a whiteout
Astray and lost on Mount Madness
Mount Sadness
