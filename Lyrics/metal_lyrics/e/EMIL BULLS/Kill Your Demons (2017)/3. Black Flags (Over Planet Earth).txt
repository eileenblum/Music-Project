This is how we go down
We are circled by evil
We're the huntsmen of torment and treason
We carry the beacon of thunder
Where we go everything will surrender
Hopelessly sicklessly
Crippled by hate
With no conscience and fate
Like beasts of prey
We slaughter we slay
Deformed to the core
It's the sick we obey
Like vermin
We infest it all
We spread disease we destroy
Black flags are waving
Those black flags are waving
Black flags waving
Over planet earth, planet earth
Black flags are waving
Those black flags are waving
The rats and the ravens are gathering
To feast on the fruit of death again
This is wrath
Even kings will bow down
Down on the ground their own blood on the crown
Our swords our thoughts are lethal
We're the fear we're the flood we're the fever
Mercilessly relentlessly
The marble hearted
On the march of deceit
Viciously ferociously
So grim so dark
In the name of their greed
Like vermin
We infest it all
We spread disease we destroy
Black flags are waving
Those black flags are waving
Black flags waving
Over planet earth, planet earth
Black flags are waving
Those black flags are waving
The rats and the ravens are gathering
To feast on the fruit of death again
It's the sick we obey
