I look a ride down the darkness to see 
If the shadows are still the place to be 
Where the light fights a loosing battle 
Where my demons try to settle down 
Night's fallen creatures are waiting to come out and do a dance with me 
I feel their slinky touch then the venom in my blood
I'm glad to be with you again 
God you're so beautiful 
In the pouring rain
I've sold my soul to the devil to see 
The great unknown mystery 
I've gone astray in the dangerous waters 
Of a pitch black haunted sea 
I took on powers I can I can hardly comprehend 
Oh babe I wanna leave this ship and never never come back
I'm glad to be with you again 
God you're so beautiful 
In the pouring rain
I'm glad to be with you again 
God you're so beautiful 
In the pouring rain
I took a ride 
I took a ride down 
I took a ride down the darkness to see 
If the shadows are still the place are still the place to be
I'm glad to be with you again 
God you're so beautiful 
In the pouring rain
I'm glad to be with you again 
God you're so beautiful 
In the pouring rain
Wash the streets off my skin 
I'm tired I wanna go home
