Go!

Inside of me rages a war 
A carnivore craving for gore 
Marching troops on parade 
Drilled for a bloody crusade

I feel the cold 
It's getting me so low 
Another load 
To end all wars

It sets my teeth on edge 
A sledge hammer drives the wedge 
Deep inside my soul 
It tips over the first domino

I feel the cold 
It's getting me so low 
Another load 
To end all wars

I feel the cold 
It's getting me so low 
Another load 
To end all wars

I feel the cold 
It's getting me so low 
Another load 
To end all wars

I feel the cold 
It's getting me so low 
Another load 
To end all wars
