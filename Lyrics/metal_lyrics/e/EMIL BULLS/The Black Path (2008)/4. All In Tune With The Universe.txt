There's a whiff of progress in the air tonight
But I keep on stumbling under the strange wheels of time
Show me your Mona Lisa smile
While you're moving the sun out of my mind

You're waving a stuck up
A stuck up goodbye

You're all in tune with the universe while the sun goes down on me
Don't let me die waiting and dreaming

Tell me where you have been
When I was lost on the black path again
I'll hold my own even though
Barely breathing bleeding from the soul

You're waving a stuck up
A stuck up goodbye

You're all in tune with the universe while the sun goes down on me

Don't let me die waiting and dreaming
You're in tune with the universe
The sun goes down on me
Don't let me die
Waiting and dreaming

The world's in the tune with the universe
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
You're in tune with the universe
The sun goes down on me, the sun goes down
On me
