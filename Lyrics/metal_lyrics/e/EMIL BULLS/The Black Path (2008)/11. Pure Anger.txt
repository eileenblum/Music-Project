Pure anger arise 
Breathing doom and fire 
Infernal flames unite 
Savage hell come alive

I'm on my way again 
I'm in good company 
I'm on my way again 
The games have just begun

Almighty 
Fire walk with me 
Around the world 
Cross the seven seas 
Hear the battle cry 
Pure anger 
Pure anger arise

Apocalyptic skies 
Purgatory by my side 
In Armageddon the earth shall die 
The darkest evil arives

I'm on my way again 
I'm in good company 
I'm on my way again 
The games have just begun

Almighty 
Fire walk with me 
Around the world 
Cross the seven seas 
Hear the battle cry 
Pure anger 
Pure anger arise

This is the end our unspeakable end 
A million planets collide 
We're all trapped the earth explodes 
A million planets collide 
The stars are falling from the sky 
A million planets collide 
Almighty fire arise on apocalyptic skies 
This is the end the earth explodes 
A million planets collide

Almighty 
Fire walk with me 
Around the world 
Cross the seven seas 
Hear the battle cry pure anger 
Pure anger arise 
Pure anger arise

Fire walk with me around the world 
Inferno 
Fire walk with me around the world 
Inferno 
Fire walk with me around the world 
Inferno 
Fire walk with me around the world 
Inferno
