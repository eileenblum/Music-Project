Now that we're worlds apart
I feel like a lesser man all balance outta control
State of mind strange and vain
Good night sleep tight
I can't get a shut eye
My spirit disappears like breath on a mirror

I need you more than you will ever know
You've come to mean the world to me
I wonder if you're sleeping while I'm crying in my beer
We're worlds apart
I wish you were here

Same song different verse
I let you down again
All excuses useless
I'm the one to blame
A love's at stake
A life goes down the drain
For a temporary fix

Some go far beyond the pale

I need you more than you will ever know
You've come to mean the world to me
I wonder if you're sleeping while I'm crying in my beer
We're worlds apart
I wish you were here

I shot poisoned frozen hung stabbed electrocuted
I burned my soul to the ground

I need you more than you will ever know
You've come to mean the world to me
I wonder if you're sleeping while I'm crying in my beer
We're worlds apart
I wish you were here
