Follow me into hades where the shades of 
Heroes wander despondendly 
Among spirits of lesser souls

In your dull eyes all your lies unite 
All your tears ally 
For absolution

Pledge allegiance to the damned 
When you meet the unseen one 
May he grant all access
To the isle of the blessed

In the harbour of death 
Shiploads of broken souls are waiting for salvation 
Salvation in everlasting bliss

In your dull eyes all your lies unite 
All your tears ally 
For absolution

Pledge allegiance to the damned 
When you meet the unseen one 
May he grant all access 
To the isle of the blessed

Pledge allegiance to the damned 
When you meet the unseen one 
May he grant all access 
To the isle of the blessed

Pledge allegiance to the damned 
When you meet the unseen one 
May he grant all access 
To the isle of the blessed

Pledge allegiance to the damned 
When you meet the unseen one 
May he grant all access 
To the isle of the blessed
