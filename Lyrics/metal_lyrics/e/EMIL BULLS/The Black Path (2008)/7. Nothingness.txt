We're in the same boat springing a leak 
We're going to sink together 
Guys like us we don't let each other drown 
We abandon no one when the biggest waves break down 
Come on
Hold your ground 
Don't give in to the bitterness 
Clean and refresh body and mind 
From all nothingness
When the clouds cover up a clear blue sky 
Show your guts 
Don't disappear 
Faster than a fly 
Sometimes you gotta fight eye for an eye 
So come on
Hold your ground 
Don't give in the bitterness 
Clean and refresh body and mind 
From all nothingness 
Hold your ground 
Don't give in 
To the bitterness
