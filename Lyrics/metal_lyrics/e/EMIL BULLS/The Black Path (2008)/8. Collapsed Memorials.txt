I am here because of you again
I am here to feel love again
I am here to pass out again
Here I am at the bitter end

I am here to see a miracle
I am here to build castles in the air
I am here to praise every flop
I'm a master of deception
Basically rotten
Long ago forgotten

Save me
A glorious euphoria
Save me
Paralized by the blinding lights

Save me

A glorious euphoria
Save me
Paralized by the blinding lights

I am here
Paralized
I am here

Save me
A glorious euphoria
Save me
Paralized by the blinding lights

Collapsed memorial
Traumatized in delirious disguise
