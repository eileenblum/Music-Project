Another glass to ease the pain 
All attempts were in vain 
I'll surrender to my lust again 
Like a hellbound wolverine

Won't you help me 
I've lost my way again 
Won't you help me 
I want you to push

Push me push me over the edge 
I'm drifting to far from the shore 
I keep my sails close to the wind 
Consign me to the sea

A box of dynamite it's me sitting on it 
Playing with fire 
Temptation delights like a good wine 
Buy the ticket take the ride

Won't you help me 
I've lost my way again 
Won't you help me 
I want you to push

Push me push me over the edge 
I'm drifting to far from the shore 
I keep my sails close to the wind 
Consign me to the sea

Push me push me over the edge 
I'm drifting to far from the shore 
I keep my sails close to the wind 
Consign me to the sea

Push me push me over the edge 
I'm drifting to far from the shore 
I keep my sails close to the wind 
Consign me to the sea
