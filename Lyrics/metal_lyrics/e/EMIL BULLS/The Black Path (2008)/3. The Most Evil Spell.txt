What the fuck, stop talking to me
You took sides against me and my family
Get the hell out of my face
This is the end, my friend

You're gonna burn for this

I cast a spell on you
The most evil spell on you
No one will ever love you again
You're gonna die alone
In fear

You fucking coward, beg like a dog
Face down in the mud
Come and get what you deserve
Everlasting punishment

I cast a spell on you

I cast a spell on you
The most evil spell on you
No one will ever love you again
You're gonna die alone
You're gonna burn in hell

Go!

Burn for this

I cast a spell on you
The most evil spell on you
No one will ever love you again
You're gonna die alone
You're gonna burn in hell
It will haunt you every night
Until the end
It will haunt you
Until the end
