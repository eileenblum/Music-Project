He's gone astray he fucked it up 
Disgraced, stigmatized 
Here he comes 
The protagonist of my life 
He's the singer baby 
Oh god 
He's the winner baby 
Supposed to be a sinner baby 
The protagonist of my life 
He's on the point of no return

I was close to the cigar 
Now I'm littered with cigarette scars 
Down the same old road 
All intentions went up in smoke

He's on a rampage 
He's in a goddamn rage 
He feels like killing something 
The protagonist of my life 
He's the singer baby 
Oh god 
He's the winner baby 
Supposed to be a sinner baby 
The protagonist of my life 
He's on the point of no return

I was close to the cigar 
Now I'm littered with cigarette scars 
Down the same old road 
All intentions went up in smoke

He's a vulture a bloodsucker 
He's the virus the disease

I was close to the cigar 
Now I'm littered with cigarette scars 
Down the same old road 
All intentions went up in smoke

Close to the cigar 
Close to the cigar 
Down the same old road 
Everything went up in smoke
