I'll take you far away
Down the darkest highway
Join my escapades
On the dark side of life

Raise your glasses followers of the black sun

Meet me in the twilight zone
Feel free to bring all your friends along
See the darkest alleys of your sickening city
The hell holes where the sun has never shone

I'll pay the costs of a journey into the night
I already arranged our alibis
Let go abandon yourself to
The poison beauty and the blood

Just set the night on fire
I'll take you far away
Down the darkest highway
Join my escapades
On the dark side
Meet the beast in me

Join me for a last showdown
I need company in this forsaken town
Let me take you out to the ultimate feast
Of fornication and debauchery

If you're ready to dance with the most poisonous snake
I'm the one the lord your soul to take
Let go abandon yourself to
The poison beauty and the blood

Just set the night on fire
I'll take you far away
Down the darkest highway
Join my escapades
On the dark side
Meet the beast in me

Raise your glasses followers of the black sun
Here's to you Mr. Alpha Wolf
Here's to you Mr. Alpha Wolf
To the poison beauty and the blood
Here's to you Mr. Alpha Wolf
To the poison beauty and the blood

I'll take you far away
Down the darkest highway
Join my escapades
On the dark side
Meet the beast in me
Come on just free the beast in me
I want you to join my escapades
On the dark side of life
Just free the beast in me
And I'll free the beast in you
Join my escapades come on
Just free the beast in me
And I'll free the beast in you
Join my escapades come on
