You'll wake up drowning in a see of red 
A horses head next to you in bed 
You'll wake up drowning in a see of red 
A horses head next to you in bed 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get away 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get away 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get away 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get 
Can't get away 
No escape 
I will hunt you down

Like super glue in your eyedrops 
A cigarette stub in your favorite drink 
The knife behind the glory hole 
My true intent is your delight

You're gonna squeal like a pig when I come to your home 
Like Charlie's disciples I creepy crawl 
You can run you can hide 
You're gonna squeal like a pig when I come to your home 
Like Charlie's disciples I creepy crawl 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get away 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get away 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get away 
You can run you can hide 
No you can't get 
Can't get away 
No escape 
I will hunt you down

Like super glue in your eyedrops 
A cigarette stub in your favorite drink 
The knife behind the glory hole 
My true intent is your delight

Can't you see I'm the devil 
Can't you see I'm the devil 
Can't you see I'm the devil

I'm here to do the devil's business

CanÂ´t get away 
You can run 
No escape 
You can hide 
I will hunt you down

Like super glue in your eyedrops 
A cigarette stub in your favorite drink 
The knife behind the glory hole 
My true intent is your delight
