To think that there'd be hope for me
I didn't dare believe
My way so endlessly lonely
I could not see the end

As out of a dream
Like a ghost in the night
With a silvery brush
And the lightest touch

You are here, are you here?
Is this real, it's too real.
I'm afraid that you'll leave
Close my eyes, make believe
You broke the fall and came to save me
You changed the path that I was taking

Are you here? Are you real? It's too real!

I thought that I'd be on my own
Lost inside a storm
You reached out and pulled me closer
Maybe there's an end

As I awake from
Chasing shadows at night
Swift as wildfire
In this bare wasteland

You are here, are you here?
Is this real, it's too real.
I'm afraid that you'll leave
Close my eyes, it's a dream
You saved my soul and came to claim it
You found my heart and tried to mend it

Are you here? Are you real? It's too real!

But you're here, now you're here
Let me sleep, let me dream!
Please don't leave, please don't leave!
