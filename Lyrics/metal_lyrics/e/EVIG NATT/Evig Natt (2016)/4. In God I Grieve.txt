In god I grieve, so many he forsakes
My shadow is cast the same way
Even though I am not one to pray
Come now sorrows, burden my chest

Senseless you drink from the cracked cup
Shameless you swallow whateverâs served
Heâs there for the weak, became a tool for the mighty
With neither Iâll ever belong

Because there is no god, just my soul unfulfilled
A sadness that took me and left me to sin
Iâll search for my own church, âtil then thereâs this
Only one thingâs for certain, we all die without his kiss

Look to the heavens! Search the dark seas!
There youâll find nothing, so let nothing set you free
For the sun gives her blood freely and her fire is life
Sheâs the true light, desire and sight

In god I grieved, he never granted his light
Alone I am free, free from his blight
Seraphic longings are laid to rest
Rid the burdens crushing my chest

So now drink the poison, youâre misled to believe
Is the sacrificed blood of his flesh and seed
It wonât bring no forgiveness to the cruelty you breed
If you donât release yourself youâre just another lamb to the slaughter

Look to the heavens!
Search the dark seas!
Thereâll you find nothing
Let nothing set you free
