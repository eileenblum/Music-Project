A storms breath sought
To keep thoughts at bay
Turn your back on my
Shadow cast your way
Swiftly dancing across
Cold walls
Seeking shelter in the light
From shadowâs claws
Days are lost to eternities grasp
A quiet sob travels further than you think
Take heed before you wage your war
Nothing is as it was before

Take heed before you wage your war
Nothing is as it was before
My fingers are blackend by your firey touch
Bringer of ice youâve scorned me

Twilight at the end of the day
Promised hope
That never comes my way.
Listen close,
And youâll hear my heart
It beats loud,
Have I outplayed my part?
You are lost to me but I will wait
For the day, when you will return to me
Emerce myself in the darkest of thoughts
Hoping this wasnât all for nought

Emerce myself in the darkest of thoughts
Hoping this wasnât all for nought
My fingers are blackend by your firey touch
Bringer of ice youâve scorned me
