In dreams, you're never far away
You forgive me my sadness and say,
"Let your tears fall to the ground
The creature of us broke our hearts"

Will I escape this emptiness?
The void you filled, I cannot give up
Our hearts entwined, as one they sound

Forever we are two,
Destined to walk alone
Distant and cold with
Weathered emotion

Keep hiding in the shadows, lie to me and look away
Deep inside I can feel who you really are

The moon wept for us
When our dreams once touched
Still I want to drown in your sweet tasting lies
