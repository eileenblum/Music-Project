[Music: Stein, Lyrics: Kirsten]

We would whisper tales of better days
No one but us could hear
Gone with the winter breeze, swept away
Frozen tears with dear for you

Lay me down now leave me here to fade
No one but you can hear
Touch the ghost of an ardent lover
Child of the cold blood heart

How can I reach?
Pull you out from under
Make you see your lifeline
Tied up to mine
Drown me in your sadness
If it makes you stay here longer
Without you I'm nothing
Hear my calls
They'll draw you closer

I'm down on my knees
You feed of my sin
I loathe what I've become
You feed of my sin

I will never let it wither away
Only you could see me through
Trust the night to bring me back again
All my faith has gone with you
