[Music &amp; Lyrics: Stein]

Darkness impales my soul
The sight, for my blinded eyes
I heard the lament craving my return
Doomed to walk the earth

Craving for darkness in man
I am the fallen, the wanderer
Burning the shadows of time
I am the end

The darkened sky will burn away the sun
Torment for my earthly flesh
Forever, I will wander
Alone into shadows
