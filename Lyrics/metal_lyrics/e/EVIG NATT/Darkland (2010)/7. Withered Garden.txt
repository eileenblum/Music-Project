[Music: Stein, Lyrics: Kirsten &amp; Stein]

Within the cold eclipse
Archaic beauty is captive
Peel from the old memories
And make me love you

In dust and shadows
Of forgotten dreams
I'll let you believe
You mean more to me
Than the stars in the skies
And all the withered leaves

I'll be the goddess in your dim light
Binding your heart with lies
Devil in the doorway
Pouring teardrops into our skies

A hero decayed
Jewel to my eyes
Dripping sadness
You are my addiction

A river of tears
To fill my withered winter garden
I cover the snow white roses

A river of tears
In your withered winter garden
I cover the snow white roses
With red tears from my eyes

Flames devoured
And left us in ruin
A pale wasteland
Covered in ashes
