[Music: Stein, Lyrics: Kirsten &amp; Stein]

I'm floating away
To find my innocence
I'm drifting away
To find my peace

Arrow to coal
Burns through the soul
Wither away
Summer to fall

In my weakness I let you see
through me
You felt my warm skin and
left me cold
Desperately searching in the
dark for you
Breathe new life in me

Take me back and un-dream
this nightmare
Forsake this bitter land and
have me taste you once more
Find me
Howling storm strangles
my call

Tears fall for thee
Embrace the dark in me
Wash me away
I'll find my peace

Sinking so deep
I watch the mourners weep
My grave cold and bleak
Forevermore

In my...

Take me back...

Water so pure
Coarse through the soul
Wash me ashore
Wash me ashore

I'm floating away
To find my innocence
I'm drifting away
To find my peace
In my...

Take me back...

Requiem aeterna dona eis,
et lux perpetua luceat eis,
Exaudi orationem meam;
ad te omnis caro veniet.
Requiem aeternam dona eis,
et lux perpetua luceat eis.
[English translation:]
Eternal rest grant unto them
and let perpetual light shine upon them
Her my prayer; to you shall all flesh come.
Eternal rest grant unto them,
and let perpetual light shine upon them.

The stillness and the cold
Draws me into shadows torn
Wasted tears for me

Still whispers within

The emptiness won't let go
Wandering towards the precious unknown
I'm longing for the dark cold silence
To take hold of my soul

This is the end of me
This is the end of me

I dream of escaping this life
The void you filled, I never gave up
I'm longing for the dark cold silence
To take hold hold of my soul

Lonely wanderer, in shadow's grasp
Headed for the Darkland I'll be
Where dreamless nights are forever
I'm waiting for the end

This is the end
This is the end of me
