[Music: Stein, Lyrics: Kirsten]

You are nothing, yet you are, everything to me
Cold winter nights, kill me slowly
I welcome every breath, it brings me
Closer to the end, to nothingness

Settling waters, that run deeper, and deeper
I close my eyes and drown in my sleep

You breathe me, you leave me
I fade, I die again
This is what I deserve

Here in the dark, this is where I belong
Never afraid, but tired of feeling
Murmurs of a past, I'm listening
I can't help but hear your whispers
