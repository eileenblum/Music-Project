[Stein]

The pain I felt inside, you swept away
Your breath stilled my heart
A moment for eternity
You lay beside my like melting shadows we drown
Will this moment last?
My thoughts wander...

Do you feel the same?

And I fall into you
Silence whispers my thoughts
And I fall through this night
With you... by my side

The warmth in your voice tore my open
If dreams could ever speak
Would this moment last?
The shadows deep in me
You embraced and tore away
Fragile and alone you held my heart

Will you ever feel the same?

And I fall into you
Silence whispers my thoughts
And I fall through this night
With you... by my side

When I felt your soul
I grasped to my own
Burning in my heart
I reach out for you
And I wonder...

Will you ever feel the same?

And I fall into you
Silence whispers my thoughts
And I fall through this night
With you...
