[Stein]

Watching the crimson veil of dawn
Tearing through silence, like darkness fall
Aching and yearning, twisting in pain
Sorrow once torn, scars from my flesh

Like withering stars, falling through time
Everlasting silence, burning within
Shadows of dreams, awakens in sleep
Burning the scars from its torment dream

Falling through a veil of mist
Blinded by darkness, its touch so sweet
Tasting the silence, the silence within
The embrace of the endless sleep

I heard the darkness, it grieves
I heard the anger, it sleeps
I am the silence of grief
I am the silence of sleep

Fell the nocturnal winds of dreams
Reflections of tears, frozen they scream
Darkness and emptiness is all I feel
Though silence grows in my soul

Like withering stars, falling through time
Everlasting silence burning within
Shadows of dreams, awakens in sleep
Burning the scars from its torment dream

Darkness embraces the cold winter moon
Like lovers dance in their macabre hold
Searching through aeons, darkness and cold
I'm craving for silence and silence I found

I heard the darkness, it grieves
I heard the anger, it sleeps
I am the silence of grief
I am the silence of sleep
