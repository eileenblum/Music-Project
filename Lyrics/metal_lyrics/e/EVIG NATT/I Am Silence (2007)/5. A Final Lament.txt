[Kirsten]

A final lament and you'll be gone
From my mind and soul
Banished to an eternity of silence
Echoing from all the walls
The most sacred of chambers
The last trace of you
Screaming at me, clawing and fighting
But my scarred flesh will hold
Numbered from all the pain
My walls, they will hold

This time no rose petal ground
For you to tread upon
This time no rose petal sheets
Cover my bed
This time no tears to drown the
Pain that burns your heart
This time it's you who yearns

You're alone

Can't you see that I'm your shadow?
I will never let you go
You are mine and you will follow
Fading are the days of old
Make me bleed; I'll make you suffer
Don't you think that I will fold
Your time will come as mine has now
You my shame, I'll take the pain
Your fear, your scars, I can heal them
All that you are I forgive
Your path will be mine, start walking
Their backs are turned, I'm all there is

I'm the silence that surrounds us
Seeping through our heart that burns
Don't look back, I'm right behind you
A song with no end, heat the hum

Scream... but no one will hear you
It dies inside your soul, you'll fall
