My demon is calling
My demon is calling out for me

You daunt me love with your dirge
In this bed I can no longer  lie
The crimson roses surrounding your heart
Like a grave for me, and so beautiful made
Guide me through, safe from all thorns

I go from defeat to defeat with myself
The stakes are too high and I'm drawn
Into this obscurity well
The moonless night is mine

My demon is calling
My demon is calling out for me

These times are over, and I must leave
Only dismay in your eyes
The sound of a sweet child deadens
Thoughts of a past as swift as colibris' wings
Delirium prison, a dark hell, this can't go on
I bid thee my farewell

Down the hollow, I hear the voices
Demons call my name
The beckon me from the shadows
Trying to draw me closer
But I know, no one travels down the hollow
It's a morbid place, home to those who's lost their way

A gust of wind, you're not here
Walking towards this apparition
The one I'd love to leave
The one I love to hate

My demon is calling
My demon is calling out for me
