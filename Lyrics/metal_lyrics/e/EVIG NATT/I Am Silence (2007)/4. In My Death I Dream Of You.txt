[Stein]

A taste of your kiss, soothes my heart
Your eyes, looking at me, but you can't see
All of my pain, of leaving you this way
My heart eager to speak, but silence screams

How could I have known?
How could I let this go on?
How could I let you go?
How could I have loved you this way?

In my death I dream of you
I hope I'll never awake
'cause in my death I dream of you
I hope I'll never awake

The pain in my heart yearning your sweet touch
All my fears, drown into darkness
Drifting away, your eyes look back at me
I try to reach out, but my scars are too deep

How could I have known?
How could I let this go on?
How could I let you go?
How could I have loved you this way?

In my death I dream of you
I hope I'll never awake
'cause in my death I dream of you
I hope I'll never awake
