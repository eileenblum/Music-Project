[Stein / Kirsten]

Oh, I wonder what lies beyond this world
Eternal darkness, must be better than this
Living in hope, aching for your last touch
Will I ever feel again?
Will I ever feel again? Feel...

Through the darkest hour, my pain unveils
My body feels like an empty shell
Tears once fallen, fallen for the last time
Never will I feel again, never will I feel again
Again...

I should have known that you wouldn't understand
Believe in nothing, would stay
And darkness covers my sanity
My soul yearns for death
My soul yearns for death

The screams inside you weakens
I grasp a hold but you let go
Don't leave; I need your pain to grow

Silence fills my mind, my eyes slowly dies
The pain I once knew, fades away

Now give into my torment
Distorts and medicates your mind
My razorblade a gift of love

I feel my last breath escapes my lips
Finally my soul is free

I should have known that you wouldn't understand
Believe in nothing, would stay
And darkness covers my sanity
My soul yearns for death
My soul yearns for death
