[Stein / Kirsten]

Diversion gone bad from time
Bewildered by all this clarity
The aberrations of youth
Making us blind

Gone into a reverie
Visions dripping through my mind
A phantasm with no end
Luring me

Into the silver realm of dreams
Behold the stygian black nightmare
Erotic this yearning
Undulating gaze, whispers breathless

Pry your eyes from under the rose
Lipstick petals crushed
Moonlight pales the resonance of you
Your innocence fades in shadows deep screams
Suffer the lonely days
Final shine for winter eyes
In deep blue dreams of May

Nemesis of heart, friend of mind
A safe calm unmistakable
This anesthetic feel of you and me
Taking shape
Painted kisses coil in waiting
Emptiness bristles beneath my skin
Colder still are the feelings fast fading
Warmed where illusions begin

A taste of me lonely
Swallowed in midnight bliss
The words you whisper
Paints pictures of your kiss

Dark thoughts of old
That does not need saying
Hidden but always lurking
In the deepest of shadows

Silent darkness comes too short
Awake a dreaming child from this blackness
Open eyes, discarding world
Chasing vision you whispered, breathless

Pry your eyes from under the rose
Lipstick petals crushed
Moonlight pales the resonance of you
Your innocence fades in shadows deep screams
Findind my resting place
When the slow dark hours come
Frosty midwinter made moon

Nemesis of heart, friend of mind
A safe calm unmistakable
This anesthetic feel of you and me
Taking shape
Painted kisses coil in waiting
Emptiness bristles beneath my skin
Colder still are the feelings fast fading
Warmed where illusions begin
