What is it for? This war for more, and gates of hell are waiting
You look so sore you fucking poor, raise your head stop shaking
Destroy the door of morbid lore, and get what you craving for
The glory of life for those who dare, just declare revolution

Spirits of cold are haunting, inside of me, yet I'm burning
These graves are yearning, waiting your awakening

And proudly spit, the shame and regret of your soul domination
Burn the lands, and insane demands, and mandatory occupation
Inhale and feast, wake up the beast of freedom you've been seeking
Exhale thy lust and never trust, demons you've been feeding

Spirits of cold are haunting, inside of me, yet I'm burning
These graves are yearning, waiting your awakening
