A child has died right inside his mother's womb
Her flesh and blood is already his tomb
A father is planted inside his grandies land
Fighting nasty pigs with the pride of an empty hand

We are never alone, the legend will reborn
Where are you now? Where have you been?

Wake up shake the whole world
You are Salah Eddeen!

Since the dawn of time, enemies of thy lord
With inhuman shapes, ruining up the world
Butcher them in every inch, and I will be your sword
Full of sinful hate, the filth of their horde

We are never alone, the legend will reborn
Where are you now? Where have you been?

Wake up shake the whole world
You are Salah Eddeen!

Holy drops of an innocent blood, will pure thy oceans of mud
In every day and season, there is nothing but freedom

Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
