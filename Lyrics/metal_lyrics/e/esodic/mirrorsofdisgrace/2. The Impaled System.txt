Your greedy eyes can't see, this system, this war
My wounds are still bleeding, stop watching like a whore
When your honour is just a word, what else could be more?
And your dignity is rotten, what are you waiting for?

You genocide, matricide, want to deicide, go suicide!
Engrave your gave, live as brave
But never a slave, you run and hide

Behind the flames she lays she screaming:
Nocturnal rats are creeping to Al-Quds the land of gods
Deep-seated malice go blazing, with fire like a flood
And manes will be hailing, and marching to thy pride

You genocide, matricide, want to deicide, go suicide!
Engrave your gave, live as brave
But never a slave, you run and hide

Don't ask about religion, I'm Muslim, I'm Christian
Don't need your prostitution and your morbid meditation
And justice must be done, with malevolence and destruction
The haze on us has gone and it's time of annihilation

You genocide, matricide, want to deicide, go suicide!
Engrave your gave, live as brave
But never a slave, you run and hide
