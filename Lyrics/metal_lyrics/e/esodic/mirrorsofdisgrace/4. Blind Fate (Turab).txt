I can feel it, it's almost the end
Strange, and weird feelings, are haunting my flesh
And it's a fire starts with my toes, colder than ice my fingers and nose
Blizzards of my past, right between my eyes
Tasteless like a leafless rose

They are waiting, for my last breath
Rest in peace, etched into my grave
Alone, like I've been, facing, my death
It's my time, but it's just a rhyme
Written with fate, we shall fade
By the same blade

And such a nice view is my young body
Inside the grave of truth, it's going muddy
Surrounded with hungry worms eating my brain
Leaving my wet corpse without a single pain

They are waiting, for my last breath,
Rest in peace, etched into my grave
Alone, like I've been, facing, my death
It's my time, but it's just a rhyme
Written with fate, we shall fade
By the same blade

No more seas and mountains and no more blue skies
No more rainbow colors as I slowly die,
No more days and nights, no sweet rise at dawn
Even roses falling asleep, just one beside my bones
