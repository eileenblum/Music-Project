Rise your flag up high, like eagles in the sky
Your pride don't let it die, and they will burn and cry
Jordan is my immortal pride, I save you deep down inside
We are all your groom, to defeat this filthy doom

Brains are washed with hate, to kill with no regret
Is that what you call Islam? Hell, no its vail charade
Let the world know well, will turn your life to hell
You will beg like a sissy pet, and die you rotten shit

For the innocent sake, your grave I will shake
Your soul I will take, and fucking pee all over your grave

For their eyes in fear were gazing
For their bodies in pain where burning
For the screams inside where fading
For their souls in peace were leaving

And here we are again, our rage goes insane
Soldiers despite the pain, Jordanians with no refrain
And so you must believe
Love this place or leave
Love this place or leave
Love this place or leave
