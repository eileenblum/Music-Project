What if this world was the end of the road?
And every tree is only you and me
Water falls are our blood, my flesh and yours are the mud
Rain drops our repent. Our sins are the dirt

Roses are shaped with colors like a human
Desires like seasons, and they are all fading
Are we dreaming while awake, or awake while dreaming?
The fatal bite and the snake, was it real or illusion?

Just stand there and see what I see, open your eyes
Assassination for you and me, erase the lies

Years are quickly passing, like tears, fears and passion
Stars and empty skies, are just a glassy box
Days and gloomy nights are balanced with paradox
When rocks are firmed as faces, and a dead sea with human traces

Just stand there and see what I see, open your eyes
Assassination for you and me, erase the lies.
