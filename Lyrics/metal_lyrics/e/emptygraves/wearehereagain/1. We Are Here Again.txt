We returned from our graves,
To break the bones, and cut the heads,
This will be the best part,
When everybody will dance

How it will ends, nobody knows
Just make sure that you still alive! [2x]

Moment is come, now you will run
Running in circles, running in circles! [2x]

[Chorus:]
Everybody says we are down, but this is our time!
Nobody will bring us down! (again)
Bring the noise from the other side!
Destroy the walls!
