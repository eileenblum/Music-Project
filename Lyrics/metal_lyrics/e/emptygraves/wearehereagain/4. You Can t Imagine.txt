You can't imagine, what i think about you
The rage in my head, the pain in my chest
Never forget, never forgive
What you've done, what you've said! [2x]

[Chorus:]
I always brook your cruel,
Now I'll punish everything you do
Every steps you ever take
Slowly leads into your grave! [2x]

Carry these words high, drown in your lies
You were never up, Just down, just down...

I'll never forget the words You've said
You never felt my fucking sad...!

I'll stab my knife into your back!!!

Oh!!!
