Lie into my face! No problem!
Like your true friends, All of them
You think I'm joking when i tell you
Your place is here were gone! [2x]

And your not match for me
Have you ever tell the truth
Since you were born?! [2x]

You are worthless
Now it will end
I'm more than you think
You are worthless
I am speechless
When i had known
You were lying
All the time
