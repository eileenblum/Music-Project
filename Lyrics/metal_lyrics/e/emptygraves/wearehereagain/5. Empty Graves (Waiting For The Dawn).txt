Oh!!!

Run!!!

Watch your blood on the ground!!!

The mild wind blow the trees, and the sun is shining
Everything is so, Calm...
You're walking home, from a distant place,
And you don't guess nothing...
Something Strange , will starts tonight, but now
Everything is still so calm...

[Chorus:]
Watch your blood, on the ground,
And ask why is this here?! [2x]

The grass under your feet , is so soft,
And the air that you breath is clear now...
Maybe it's the last???!!! [2x]

[Chorus]

So now, you can't run
The dead will come...
Your eyes on the sky,
Your blood on the ground...
So now that you're dead,
It's time to wake up!!! [2x]
