"If I tell you a secret, do you promise you will never tell a soul?"
"I promise."
"This world is not as you know it.
Even though the solstice nights and the untamed hearts
Remained a distant pulse in the recent past, this world is dying on its feet"
"I do not believe you."
"Really?! Well goddamn my dear, you can strike a deal with the devil if you wish.
But should we pass on the road to ruin,
as I trace my finger across the gold of the sun,
remember we are just a vessel of the stars.
Remember we are not the holders of this earth."
