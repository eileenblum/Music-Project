Along the lines of your face and the hollow of your skin,
I see a snake with a furrowed brow and an empty oil can for a heart.
Some might say treason of the highest order.
But if you listen closely, very closely, you can hear him whisper:
"Attack! Attack! Attack!"
Kill everything that moves. Man, woman and child.
Skin them alive and cage them inside of me.
"ATTACK! ATTACK! ATTACK!"
Run for your lives.
