And although I lie here dying,
Broken-bodied, spirit torn to shreds
And the desire that fed my longing
Lies dead and bleeding by my side

I can feel my burning power
A red giant slowly seeping away
My flesh to become as the mountains
And my blood to feed the sea it once held

A breeze whispers over my body
This carcass of molten flame
Healing the crags and the gashes
In a soft-focus twilight I drown

The breeze becomes a torrent
With my spirit ushered far and beyond
And my frozen pursuer is rising
To be broken again by mourning dawn
