Once I was complete, a man
Righteous, tall, of threaded stock
My fragmented memory sees so clear
This final tale I'll truly know

How I long for sweet oblivion
The balmy Lethe on the downs
I wish the void would break
And nothingness take away my fall

I saw a demon face peering
Or maybe looking through the mirror
It seems so crowded in my head now
Inside of meâ¦ (in front of you)

Oh, Eternity
It just keeps on going
On, and on and onâ¦

My rites of passage started then
I'd lie to say I didn't know
Three men died upon my blade
To sate the blood lust, to turn me cold

I let her drink the blood of each
Before I slit her lying throat
And in the quartered bloods I saw
All to be ahead of me (behind of you)

My screams were lost in sound
My flesh was torn by piercing star-winds
And as I was lost the beast was found
And fire hit us all around

Oh, Eternity
It just keeps on going
On, and on and onâ¦

Since that day I (we) roam the worlds
My (our) new form horrid, vile
I (we) tell truths to many men
And lies and both and I (us)

I (we) have made a thousand demons
Million darkest shrouds
Trying to bring them as me (us)
In front of them (behind of me)

Their supermassive pain and misery
Feeding the nothing within
Nothing I'm and naught I'll be
Such is the price of Eternity (my sanity)
That just keeps going
On and on and onâ¦
