The walls are closing over me
My coffin world, its closing lid
I'm battering I can't escape
Outside of time
The walls are closing over me

Outside of time is all I see
Outside and I'm not looking in
Inside my half-life prison
The flames rise
Outside of time is all I see

The flames rise and beckon me
Embrace me now and none I see
Delighted burn me and I'll be
Ashes gray
The flames rise and beckon me

Ashes gray I see no end
Then ignite and rise again
And fall and all I was to be
Forgotten void
Ashes gray I see no end

Forgotten void I breathe it in
It fills me whole and incomplete
The Tower's empty just like me
Time-delay
Forgotten void I breathe it in

Time-delay I live, I be
Forgotten void that raptures me
To ashes gray surrounding me
To flames rising burning me
Outside of time all I can be
The walls are closing
Walls are closing
Walls are closing
Over me

And not until the walls alone
Void and flame both shattered, gone
Within these coffin walls I'll strive
To live my time-delay life
