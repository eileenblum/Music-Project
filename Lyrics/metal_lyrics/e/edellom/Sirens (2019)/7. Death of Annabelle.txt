In silent nightmare I found your warmth
You heard my screams in darkness
My sweet and charming prince of death
And now in silence I shall remain.

Locked inside my own horror
I ran so far, so far
You caught my breath to hold
And now in silence I shall remain.

My lonely princess of great resort
It's you who came to me at night
Whose blood was spilled as sacrifice
I craved you for too long
Now in silence you shall remain.

In the dark and dusty room I sit.
I wait for you, my love, my light
You paint my name in blood
And now in silence I shall remain

In the dark and dusty room I sit.
I wait for you, my love, my light
You paint my name in blood
And now in silence I shall remain

In the dark and dusty room I sit.
I wait for you, my love, my light
You paint my name in blood
And now in silence I shall remain

Your beauty has blinded me
I am ashes to your feet
I am your deadly master of delight
I kiss your skin with my cold blade
And now in silence you shall remain.
And now in silence you shall remain.
And now in silence you shall remain.

The blood of a damned soul flows
It drained the legacy of hers
The walls are cursed to keep a secret
They're seen, but never see.
