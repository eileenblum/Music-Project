Come to me, come to me, my brightest star
Shine fiercely, shine fiercely as we draw near
Embrace my, embrace my abiding love
Closer...

I feel but a shaded pulse
Runs through my veins
Pulls me into the void
Of hers, of hers...

Black sorceress of sublime magic
Casts spells of mist and clouds
With silver hair and skin of snow
And eyes as vacant as night-sky

Step into my light
Of blackness
Let my warmth cradle
Your soul

I see endless dark beneath me
Feebly it calls, yearning
Yet I should not yield
I must resist

Black sorceress of sublime magic
Casts spells of mist and clouds
With silver hair and skin of snow
And eyes as vacant as night-sky

Come to me, damned mortal
Fall down as I command
Give me your everything
Now die and despair

Death to all (and everything)
All shall burn (none remains)
This is the end (of all, for all)
Now die, my love (my acid regret)
