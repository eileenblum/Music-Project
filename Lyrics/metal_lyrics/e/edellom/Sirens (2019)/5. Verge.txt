I drown in your ashes
I see your light shine
So dim, so distant
Yet bright, so bright it blinds me

I see the blood dripping
Down my arms, so slow
When my consciousness' awakened, I see
(This is not me)

I
Crave
Blood
I
Want
Pain
I
Am
Wrath
I
Am
The
Godly form of justice

Haunting all your dreams
I'll never leave you
I am your repression
Aggression
Solace

Darling, I am yours
And you are mine
I will stay beside you
Inside you
Forever

Abysmal darkness
Bites in your heart
I will hide inside the shadows
I'm there...
I'm there...
I'm there...
I'm there...
