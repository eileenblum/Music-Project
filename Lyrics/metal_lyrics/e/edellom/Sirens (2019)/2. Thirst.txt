My thirst cannot be quenched

Through flame and distress
Walk for me, my love
Through infernal chasms and seas
Die for me, my love

Through constant abrading despair
Walk for me, my love
Through the unending depths of Hades
Die for me, my love

Unmake wretched abhorrence and destroy my opponents and enemies
Wear and consume all essence of life as I desire
Death shall come to all

Death shall come to all!
Death shall come to all!
Death shall come to all!
Death shall come to all!

Flare as I command, my love
Bring forth death, my love
