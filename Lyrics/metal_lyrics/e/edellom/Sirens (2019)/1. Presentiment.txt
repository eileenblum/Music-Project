In my dreams I see
I see a cloaked figure
Mutely it drifts
Drifts by the wind

And as fear creeps into my soul
It sings, it chants
Chants a psalm

Give me all (I will)
I crave the world (all shall burn)
Give me all (for you, I will)

I see eyes of endless blue
As cold as winter-frost
I see fire of ageless youth
Relentless stone and haze

Stone and haze
Stone and haze
Stone and haze
Stone and haze

I know not what witchcraft
She laid on me that day
What blackness entwined my fate with hers
My will to dwindle into a languished thread

Give me all (I will)
I crave the world (all shall burn)
Give me all (for you, I will)

Give me all (I will)
I crave the world (all shall burn)
Give me all (for you, I will)

So blind yet sees everything
So strayed yet never lost
So mindless yet free as an eagle
So weak yet stronger than all
