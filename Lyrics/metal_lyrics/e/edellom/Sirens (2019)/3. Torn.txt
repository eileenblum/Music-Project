Illusive cobwebs of fate, weaving gloom and woe
Where have you been leading me to?
Delusive ways of fortune, heedlessly I took this path
Yet doubt bloomed within my heart

The infinite spiral
Keeps whirling as we linger on
Shuts our will and shatters our deeds
Collects our consciousness' remnants
To set them on a new course

Stay by my side - I am bewitched
Together we'll conquer - a cruel deceit
All shall be ours - she seeks for no allies
Forever to reign - sole is the throne

The infinite spiral
Keeps whirling as we linger on
Shuts our will and shatters our deeds
Collects our consciousness' remnants
To set them on a new course

Will I break?
Will I break?
Will I break?
Will I break?

All for her
All for her
All for her
All for her
