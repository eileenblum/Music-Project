I used to see her
In every corner of my dreams
Heavenly beauty, cold
A goddess, a dream, a ghost

I used to see her (was it me?)
In every corner of my dreams
Heavenly beauty, cold (was it me?)
A goddess, a dream, a ghost

Her beauty never died with her
(Can you see me?)
Though she burned in flames
(Can you see me?)
It was nothing but an illusion
(Can you feel my beating heart?)
Not real

Oh, the monstrous deeds I have done
(Are you still mine?)
Bloodshed, pain and death
(Can you hear me breathing?)
These dreaded nightmares are forming
(Can you feel my warmth?)
In the shape of hers

I am your only solace
I am the solid ground under your feet
I am your salvation
I am the only savior to your soul

I am your only solace
(Lies!)
I am the solid ground under your feet
(Lies!)
I am your salvation
(Lies!)
I am the only savior to your soul
(Lies!)
I am your only solace
(Lies!)
I am the solid ground under your feet
(Lies!)
I am your salvation
(Lies!)
I am the only savior to your soul
(Lies!)
