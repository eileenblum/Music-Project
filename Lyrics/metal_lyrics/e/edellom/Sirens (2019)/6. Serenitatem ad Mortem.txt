Cold, pale moonlight
I've come to tell you,
My love,
I'm in death's embrace
Again

Sweet words of bitter solitude
Worlds collide
And dreams collapse

Cold, pale moonlight
My path has been lost
My love,
In an ocean of decaying
Darkness

Sweet words of bitter solitude
Worlds collide
And dreams collapse

I drown in warm corruption
In the innocence of mine
I've given in to the predator
Now I drown

Come to me,
My Dark Mistress
I lay down my pride
Like ashes at your feet
As I burn in the flames of your agony

Cold, pale moonlight
I've come to tell you
My love,
The predator won my heart
Again

Sweet words of bitter solitude
Like claws
Pushed under my skin

Come to me,
My Dark Mistress
I strip off my armor
To show you my real self
As I freeze in the cold of your
Misery

I drown in warm corruption
(You drown in warm corruption)
In the innocence of mine
(In the innocence of yours)
I've given in to the predator
(You've given in, my Mistress)
Now we drown

Donec mors nos unum
