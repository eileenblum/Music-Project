No power, no police
No sustenance or communication
Every human for themselves
In a landscape of devastation.

The only guarantee is that
This won't last forever.
Past cultures never thought that
Theirs would end either.

The terror strike that leveled cities
A way of life has ended
Electromagnetic pulse weapon
Technology deleted

The only guarantee is that
This won't last forever.
Past cultures never thought that
Theirs would end either.

A biological weapons attack
Fear and plague wreak havoc
Nuclear accidents
Unnatural disasters
The planet crushed by a meteor
Volcanic debris rains down
Polar shift brings our demise
A climatic cataclysm.

Assured of civilization's end
Now trapped in the aftermath
The planet is now transformed
All life altered forever

The only guarantee is that
This won't last forever
Past cultures never thought that
Theirs would end either
