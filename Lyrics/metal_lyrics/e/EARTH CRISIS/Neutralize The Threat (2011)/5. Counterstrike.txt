Black smoke pours from hollow windows
Palace of justice under assault
Cartel mercenaries on the warpath
Fighting police in the street
Cocaine flows out through hurricanes of violence
Their forced to comply
Manipulated by their darkest fears
Withdrawn into silence

Traitors
Do the devil's work
Fevers
Lost in avarice
Beyond
A means to survive
Fevers
Lost in avarice

Civilians, judges, police zeroed in
Centered in the crosshairs with no way to win
Live from day to day, trapped in a nightmare
Of bloodshed and terror
Bomb fragments tear
Lead pierces through
Mutilated victims fall to the ground
Tortured to death ghastly murders
Left decapitated

Traitors
Do the devil's work
Fevers
Lost in avarice
Beyond
A means to survive
Fevers
Lost in avarice

The bold resist
Overt and in stealth
Pursuing their enemies
Through the city

Chased down killed on site
One by one they fall
The cartel's terror ends with each demise

Counterstrike
Counterstrike
Counterstrike
Traitors
Do the devil's work
Fevers
Lost in avarice
Beyond
A means to survive
Fevers
Lost in avarice

Traitors
Do the devil's work
Fevers
Lost in avarice
Beyond
A means to survive
Fevers
Lost in avarice
