Neutralize the threat!

I'm encircled by filth and chaos.
Self-preservation.
Surrounded by parasites and vileness.
Self-preservation.

In the abysmal depths of urban decay
A nightmare
Humans exist without humanity
Rotting cores inside of a rotting core
Brutalized
Now the doors are torn from the gates of hell.

Rise solitary from the concrete.
Self-preservation.
Bloodied and smashed, haunted by pain.
Self-preservation.

Resolve hardens to never again
Now must crush
Suffer at the hands of walking demons
A climate of criminality
Must resist
Enabled by traitors who live in delusions.

The hunters and the prey.

Defense mechanism, instincts overtake
Lights flicker as the subway car shakes
And now the weapon's drawn
And now the weapon's raised

Fire again and again
Severing the spinal chord
Fire again and again
Blood pours onto the floor
Fire again and again
Lifeless they collapse
Fire again and again
Escape out the door.

Neutralize the threat!
Neutralize the threat!
Neutralize the threat!
Neutralize.
Neutralize the threat!
Neutralize.
