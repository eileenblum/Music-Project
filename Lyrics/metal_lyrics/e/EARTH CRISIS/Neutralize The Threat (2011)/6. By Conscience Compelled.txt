They're defenseless creatures
That were sentenced to die.
Held captive from their inception
Throughout their lives.
Instinctual yearning to escape, to be free.
Their only value to humans is monetary.

A silhouette in the dark,
Bolt cutters slice through steel
To emancipate the condemned
By conscience compelled
Clouds cover over
Each mink disappears into the night
By conscience compelled
Adrenaline surges. Anxiety boils.
The sense of empathy
Overwhelms the fear
Compassion overpowers all the hesitation
Animated by the urgency
Fate has handed their rescue down to me.
A silhouette in the dark,
Bolt cutters slice through steel
To emancipate the condemned
By conscience compelled
Clouds cover over
Each mink disappears into the night
By conscience compelled.

The net slowly closes. Can't slip away.

Stay paces ahead
With nowhere to hide
They were always one step behind
It was only a matter of time
Now nothing to regret
Locked inside a prison cell
Driven by conviction
Nothing near their hell
A silhouette in the dark,
Bolt cutters slice through steel
To emancipate the condemned
By conscience compelled
Clouds cover over
Each mink disappears into the night
By conscience compelled.

There are no regrets.
There are no regrets.
By conscience compelled.
By conscience compelled.
