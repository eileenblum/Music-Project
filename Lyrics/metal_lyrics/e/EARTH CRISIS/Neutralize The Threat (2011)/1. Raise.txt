Out of the ashes,
Out of the ruins
In the eye of the storm
Justice is the paramount priority
Restore order
Our standard raised aloft
To waiver above our heads
On reconquered ground
All under the darkened smoke filled sky.

No, we never forgave
Now the axe blades descend
Always seared in our minds
Strands of piano wire constrict into the guilties flesh

Out of the ashes
Out of the ruins
In the eye of the storm
Justice is the paramount priority
Restore order
Our standard raised aloft
To waiver above our heads
On reconquered ground
All under the darkened smoke filled sky.
