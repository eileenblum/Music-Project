Viscous and sadistic
Savages run rampant.
Fear waits in the dark at every turn.
The assailants
Brazen murderers
Evil floods the vacuum.
Moral guidelines erode away.

The shadow rises
Against them in wrath
Avenging wraiths.
The shadow rises
Against them in wrath
A hail of lead

Enforcers of the law
Forced to operate
Above the law.
For the sake of justice
Lives put on the line.
Sweep the scythe to see
The wicked fall this time.

The shadow rises
Against them in wrath
Avenging wraiths.
The shadow rises
Against them in wrath
A hail of lead.

Intolerant
For the unforgivable,
Won't capitulate
To the enemies
Of a sane society.
Exterminate the infestation
Black talons tear.
Black talons tear.

Beneath the palms
Moonlight gleams on metal roofs
Footsteps on broken pavement
Advancing to execute

The shadow rises
Against them in wrath
Avenging wraiths
The shadow rises
Against them in wrath
A hail of lead

Black talons tear
Black talons tear
Black talons tear
Black talons tear
