Through any means

The thunder of rotor blades
Bares them into the sky
From above the treetops
Nothing eludes their eyes
Search to find to eradicate
Hover descend surround
Every footstep forward could be
Their last one on the ground

Locked in a struggle
Without an end
Fighting to hold back
The poisoning

Leaves and grasses waver
Draw in for the attack
Lethal force implemented
Advance assault and clear
Charges detonate
A flash as they demolish
The drug labs incinerate.
Hundreds die every year.

Locked in a struggle
Without an end
Fighting to hold back
The poisoning

The addicts
Are prisoners
The wealth grows
Now the terror spreads like a cancer
Innocent blood is spilled
By their hands
Now the terror spreads like a cancer.

From the
Front line

Through any means

Eradicators on the front line
Eradicators on the front line

Locked in a struggle
Without an end
Fighting to hold back
The poisoning
Locked in a struggle
Without an end
Fighting to hold back
The poisoning
