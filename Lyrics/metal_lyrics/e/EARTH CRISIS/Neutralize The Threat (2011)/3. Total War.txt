Disrupt, destroy.

Fuses burn 'til pipe bombs detonate
From the blasts concussion shattered walls quake
Rain falls through the pools of light
Beneath the street lamps as we run
Striking back against those who afflict and infect victims with the plague
Left strung out condemned to die
Suffering in horrific pain.

Reason and warnings
All went ignored.
Amnesty's over.
Now total war.

The soldiers of the peoples revolt retaliate
With force against force
Determining their fate.

Districts in the Emerald Isle sink
Into a venomous flood
Their hands are forced
Driven to quell
To draw out the guilties blood.

Reason and warnings
All went ignored.
Amnesty's over.
Now total war.

The soldiers of the peoples revolt retaliate
With force against force
Determining their fate

Ravaging
Every class
All against
Balance offset
Disrupt, destroy
The antidote
To the sickness
The only way

Restabilize
Regain control
Restabilize
Regain control

Restabilize
Regain control
Restabilize
Regain control

Reason and warnings
All went ignored.
Amnesty's over.
Now total war.

The soldiers of the peoples revolt retaliate
With force against force
Determining their fate.
