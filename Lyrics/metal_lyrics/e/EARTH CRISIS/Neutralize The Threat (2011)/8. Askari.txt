Crumbling buildings,
Predators in the streets
Ruthless and cruel
They're not uncontested
Resistance soldiers
Alter the course
Illegitimate capitalism tax
Take by force

Drive-bys and shakedowns
Militant to the core
Armed to the teeth
Waging a war

Vigilant guardians
Defend their kin
From abusive authority
Strive to be free
Push back against the pushers who
Push doses of death
Against nefarious traitors who trade
In human flesh

Drive-bys and shakedowns
Militant to the core
Armed to the teeth
Waging a war.

At last
Criminals
Are the ones
Who look back in fear.

Who will fight by my side?
Who is not afraid to die?
Who will fight by my side?
Who is not afraid to die?

Crumbling buildings
Predators in the streets
Ruthless and cruel
They're not uncontested
Resistance soldiers
Alter the course
Illegitimate capitalism tax
Take by force

Drive-bys and shakedowns
Militant to the core
Armed to the teeth
Waging a war

At last
Criminals
Are the ones
Who look back in fear.
