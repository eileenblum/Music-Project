Prey upon
Prey upon

The desperate and lost
Despite the cost
Creating nothing
Except misery
To live out a Scarface fantasy
To look into their eyes and see
Watch them diminish day by day
Grim reapers disseminate the heroin.

Contrivers of a false escape
Indifferent to the suffering
It creates.

Died with a needle in her arm
Her son knelt at her side
The end of a world
A 100 kiloton blast

With legalese
Police hands are tied
Or profit from payments
To turn a blind eye
Manipulate their way through the
System unscathed each time
Slither there way out only to
Poison more lives again
Poison more lives

Not all are frozen in fear
Dismiss the offer for a reprieve
Rounds tear through the purveyors flesh
Dead in a pool of blood.

Died with a needle in her arm
Her son knelt at her side
The end of a world
A 100 kiloton blast.
