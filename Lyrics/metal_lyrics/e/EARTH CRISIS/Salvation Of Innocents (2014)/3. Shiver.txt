Shiver.

Discordant shrieks ring from every side
To echo down the halls.

Soulless eyes stare into mine,
Apathetic to the agony
That their hands inflict upon me
The tormentors are emotionless.

Yearning for our last heartbeat
Our escape's impossible from their ghoulish acts

Soulless eyes stare into mine,
Apathetic to the agony
That their hands inflict upon me.
The tormentors are emotionless.

Quaking in terror
As the figures meet our gaze
Restrained beneath the light as their scalpels raise
Locked in constraints as blades slice through our skin
Blood spills from the wounds as the torture begins.
Devices inserted the current courses in
Jaws and limbs waver in silent motion.

Shiver.
Shiver.

Soulless eyes stare into mine,
Apathetic to the agony
That their hands inflict upon me.
The tormentors are emotionless.
