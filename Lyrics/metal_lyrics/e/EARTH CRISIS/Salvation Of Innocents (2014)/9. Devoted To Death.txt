Can't reset to the time before
Who I once was is never more
The lesson that echoes forward
From the distant past
A gear that turns times cyclical
Balance is cast

Singular dimensional
Biological automatons
An alternate reality
Where lives are used as pawns

Choke down the jagged fragments
Left mutilated within
Struggle to maintain the anger's suppression
I can't erase the actuality
That plagues my thoughts incessantly

Singular dimensional
Biological automatons
An alternate reality
Where lives are used as pawns
Singular dimensional
Biological automatons
An alternate reality
Where lives are used as pawns

How could a life be
Devoted to death?
Beyond belief how can this be
It baffles my mind
Beyond belief how can this be
It baffles my mind

Singular dimensional
Biological automatons
An alternate reality
Where lives are used as pawns
Singular dimensional
Biological automatons
An alternate reality
Where lives are used as pawns

How could a life be
Devoted to death?
How could a life be
Devoted to death?
Beyond belief how can this be
It baffles my mind
Beyond belief how can this be
It baffles my mind
