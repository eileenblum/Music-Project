I can't let myself decay.

Feel myself sinking into
The darkest thoughts I've ever known
Visions of torrents of blood
Flicker in my mind when I think of their crimes
To strike back for them, to watch it collapse
To know they'll never victimize again
Not ever at all.

Can't let myself decay into to what I despise
Resist the pull of the darkness
Above the hate I have to rise

Fight to hold the high ground
Focus on setting them free
Won't contribute to the psycho
Won't contribute to the madness

Tentacles of the altering eye
Hold the lens of distortion over it all

Can't let myself decay into to what I despise
Resist the pull of the darkness
Above the hate I have to rise

I have to rise.
