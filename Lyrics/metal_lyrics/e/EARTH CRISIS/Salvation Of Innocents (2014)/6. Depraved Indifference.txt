Pointless, needless
Beyond human comprehension
Existence devoted
To nightmarish sadism
How has science been advanced
When vivisection destroys lives?
By their indifference,
By their acceptance
Humanity's been lowered in my eyes

The lack of outrage speaks volumes
In the absence of empathy
When an animal identical to their own
Is tortured without mercy.

Only a bloodthirsty
Psychopath would do this
As their choice
After the sight of tears
After hearing the pain in their voice
Wailing in terror
For the hideous acts of abuse to end
Before minds shatter they contort
They twist and bend.

The lack of outrage speaks volumes
In the absence of empathy
When an animal identical to their own
Is tortured without mercy.

Ailing volunteers would advance
The process overnight
Cures perfected in time to save them
Never see the light
Depraved indifference to the creatures' lives
While humans lives are lost
For industry, for legality
All suffer the cost
The horror that won't subside
Like a tumor that grows and multiplies
Can't erase the actuality
That plagues my thoughts incessantly.

The lack of outrage speaks volumes
In the absence of empathy
When an animal identical to their own
Is tortured without mercy.
