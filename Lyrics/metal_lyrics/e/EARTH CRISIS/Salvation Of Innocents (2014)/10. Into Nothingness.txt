From one shift after another
It all blurs into nothingness
A drone that's set to turn the gears
In a facility that I disgust

Pierced by a glare of painful reproach
As my vision reveals my own reflection

Down the winding corridors
Beneath the phosphorescent lamps
Their desperate cries resonate
From tombs they emanate

Pierced by a glare of painful reproach
As my vision reveals my own reflection

How long can this continue on?
How much more can [?]
I can't ignore this forever and leave them to this fate.

Evil is as real as the ground beneath
Their reasoning is falseness
I won't be complicit.
I won't be complicit.

From one shift after another
It all blurs into nothingness
A drone that's set to turn the gears
In a facility that I disgust

I'm not afraid to oppose.
