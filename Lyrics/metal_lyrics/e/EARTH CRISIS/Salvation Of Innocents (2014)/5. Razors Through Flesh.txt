Another horde of fools surges against the gates

Their empty slogans bore me
I'll never stop.

Outrage in their voices
On the verge of insanity
The tantrums of emotional children
Are all that I see
Accosted with hollow threats
So we're back to all of this again
As I walk in the door to the lab

Their empty slogans bore me
I'll never stop.

All their protest and their efforts
Don't do anything at all.
They're trivialized by the press
While I'm protected by the law
Accosted with hollow threats

End your
Research
On animals
Your activism is a fad

End your
Research
On animals
You'll be on to the next trend

End your
Research
On animals
After the novelty has passed

End your
Research
On animals
When your fever finally breaks.

The lab persists without a pause
You will all betray your cause
Suppressed by urge to laugh
As their voices fade away

After I'll still be here
I'll never stop
After I'll still be here
Drawing razors through flesh
After you're all gone
I'll still be here
Drawing razors through the flesh.
