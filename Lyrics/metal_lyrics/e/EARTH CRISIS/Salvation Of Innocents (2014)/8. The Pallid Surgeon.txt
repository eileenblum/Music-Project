[?]
Only consciousnes and unconsciousness
Shocked awake with their screams
Pouring from my nightmares
Swallowed into darkness by the mouth of hell
Scared by the grotesque
In my mind they dwell

It's terrifying callousness
As if the animals were nothing
Only referred to as test subjects
As if they weren't living

Cavalier and dismissive
Creatures denied for what they are
Icy rationalizations as they tear them apart

It's terrifying callousness
As if the animals were nothing
Only referred to as test subjects
As if they weren't living.

Unveil what they conceal.
It's for scientific progress.
Unveil what they conceal.
How is this advancement?
What is the difference
From the atrocities
Of the pallid surgeon
Of the innocents demise?

It's terrifying callousness
As if the animals were nothing
Only referred to as test subjects
As if they weren't living.

What is the difference
From the atrocities
Of the pallid surgeon
Of the innocents demise?
