Awakened to be tortured
Dying through another day
Trapped in an inescapable prison
All hope is gone to get away from here
Wither in pain frozen in fear
Only death can make all this end
Horrific agony
The antagonist is all that I can see
Is all that I can see

The nightmare draws on without an ending
Condemned to suffer

Demented shells of beings crumble
Normalcy has become anguish
Rows of violated creatures wait for their lives
To all be extinguished
This is a place devoid of reason
No trace of pity
Terrifying mercilessness
Sickening in their destructiveness
In their destructiveness.

The nightmare draws on without an ending
Condemned to suffer

Metal jaws constrict and crush,
Fangs of steel pierce through our flesh,
Corrosives scald and then dissolve.
Let this be my final breath.

Let this be my final breath.
Let this be my final breath.
Let this be my final breath.
Let this be my final breath.
Let this be my final breath.
Let this be my final breath.
