Never turn my back on them
I could never live as I once did
I have to obey my conscience and answer to all
That it bids
Why would the hand of fate place me here
If it wasnât to heed the call?
Destined to be the one who steps up
Out of line to save them

All the files dissolve
Awash in smoking acid
Ill gotten gains their total destruction
Rushed through the lab to set the prisoners free
From the horror that they were locked into

If what went on behind these walls
Happened in the publicâs view
These tests would end from the disgust
This would never continue
Ticks of the clock rushing forward
Thereâs only moments of time to rescue them
Then to escape follow the plan
Line by line

The files dissolve awash smoking acid
Ill gotten gains their total destruction
Rushed through the lab to set the prisoners free
From the horror that they were locked into

Out of the cages
Out of the cages
Out of the cages
Out of the cages
