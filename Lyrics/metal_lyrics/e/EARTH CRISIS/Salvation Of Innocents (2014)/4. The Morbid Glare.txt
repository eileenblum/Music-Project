Practitioners of sadism
Their monstrous countenance
Evident in the morbid glare
Of perverse science
Beware the disease research
Pharmaceutical complex
Distorting propaganda
Leaves the public vex

Drugs and devices hyped as salvation
Hold back cures to prolong the treatment's extinction

The atrociousness of the intentional
Inducement of injury
Animal research persists a fraudulent practice
? an unrealistic representation of humans
Wasting time costing lives
Misleading conclusions

Drugs and devices hyped as salvation
Hold back cures to prolong the treatment's extinction

Confinement... deprivation
Trauma... devastation
Differences in metabolism
Blood pressure and anatomy
Erroneous data is
All that there is to see
Practitioners of sadism
Their monstrous countenance
Evident in the morbid glare
Of perverse science.
