Glaring through the bars
At a world that I despise
Everyday spent in confinement
Everyday I'm victimized
Thoughts of freedom dwindle
Down to a memory
Growing fainter and fainter
Now pain is all I know and feel.

Entombed inside the
Utmost depths of hell
Doomed to suffer a fate
That's inescapable
Entombed inside the
Utmost depths of hell
Doomed to suffer a fate
That's inescapable

Won't stop resisting
Fight to stay alive
Until I'm free or until I die
My kind means nothing to them
They mock our sorrow and fear,
Laugh at our screams of pain.
There is no reason.
There is no reason! 
No reason!
The error would be in stopping short
Of what will stop them
Confront and combat
With all that we have
It's not wrong to hate evil men.

Entombed inside the
Utmost depths of hell
Doomed to suffer a fate
That's inescapable.
Entombed inside the
Utmost depths of hell
Doomed to suffer a fate
That's inescapable.
