It's time to de-desensitize

Robotic in my programmed routine
Cycle through the days like a machine
From task to task complete repeat
Incessant drudgery set to repeat

Now I'll be the one to shatter the trance
It's time to de-desensitize
My actions will be the reason why
It's time to de-desensitize

The commotion outside of the gates
Is the voice of reason that will change the captive's fate
Follow the course of events
Trace the trajectory
One way or another
They will all be freed

Now I'll be the one to shatter the trance
It's time to de-desensitize
My actions will be the reason why
It's time to de-desensitize

Two prongs of attack
Set for emancipation
From conviction to commitment
Liberate through action
What other choice is left
To stop these crimes?
I'd rather break unjust laws
Than turn away this time.

It's over when they're rescued
Not a single moment before
Compassion overthrows self-interest
It's what all this risk is for.
It's what all this risk is for.

Now I'll be the one to shatter the trance
It's time to de-desensitize
My actions will be the reason why
It's time to de-desensitize.

Two prongs of attack
Set for emancipation
From conviction to commitment
Liberate through action
What other choice is left
To stop these crimes?
I'd rather break unjust laws
Than turn away this time.
