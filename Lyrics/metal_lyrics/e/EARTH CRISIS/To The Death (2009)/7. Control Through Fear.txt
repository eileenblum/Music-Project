Control throught fear
Let the chaos reign
Agents of disorder
Plague bearers' swarm

Marionettes at
Unseen masters hands
Sledgehammers crack the pillars
Till they barely stand

Link by link
The chains constrict
Over time
Shackles slowly tighten
Alterers of perseption
Lead down a darkened path
Clouds of smoke sent up to
Obliterate the past

Control throught fear
Let the chaos reign
Agents of disorder
Plague bearers' swarm
Link by link
The chains constrict
Over time
Shackles slowly tighten
Alterers of perseption
Lead down a darkened path
Clouds of smoke sent up to
Obliterate the past

They're victims of subconscious suicide
They're enablers of the crime
Poisen against creatve devision
Drvie the wedge fragement cohesion
A nightmare
Brought into reality
Can't turn back
Ruins are all I see

Control throught fear
Let the chaos reign
Agents of disorder
Plague bearers' swarm
Marionettes at
Unseen masters hands
Sledgehammers crack the pillars
Now they fall
