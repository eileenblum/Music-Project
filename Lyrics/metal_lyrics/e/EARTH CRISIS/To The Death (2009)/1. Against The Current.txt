To defy or tranquilize
Pretense to
assimilate
Normalized till accepted
Caution falls to attrition
Keep my head
above the surface
Holding on against the current
Raise the glass to crown the
heights
To accelerate
Inhale the easy answer
The burning embers
wait
Traverse the gateway
In a haze of smoke
Hits to pills until
No other
way to cope
Rendered Lifeless
Keep my head above the surface
Holding on
against the current
Rivers of toxins
Dragged under and down
Caught in a
torrent
Until they disappear
Warnings fall on deaf ears
Fractured lives
slowly break
Wounds and scars last for life
Ruins left in their
wake
Repulsed by all that I see
Waves break over me
Everlasting
loyalty
Straight Edge in contrast
To the conscious corpses
That drift
lifeless past
Keep my head above the surface
Straight edge against the
current.
