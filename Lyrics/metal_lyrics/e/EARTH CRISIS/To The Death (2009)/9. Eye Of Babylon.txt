Projected from the eye of Babylon
Disseminate the vileness
Till every psyche is scarred
Virtue mocked and cut down
History falsified
Traditions assaulted
That once unified
Do as thou will
In the world without God
Now the earth's a hell
Humans a fallen race
Cast the smashed remains
Of the moral compass away
Not brave or new
A hi-tech lapse into
The arcane and the cruel
What crimes of geneticists await
Now god's creations are twisted
Alterations tempt destruction
Crops that can't regenerate
Animails modified for profit
Humans for slavery or war
