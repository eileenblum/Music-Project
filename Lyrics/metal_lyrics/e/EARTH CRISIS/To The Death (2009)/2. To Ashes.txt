Deterioration accelerates
My kin a prisoner
Now the reaper
awaits
A demon encased
Inside of human skin
A profiteer that feeds
A plague
of addiction
Thereâs no option, Thereâs no recourse
Thereâs no other
way
Every meth lab burned
To ashes
Every meth lab burned
Crimson
flames
Against the darkened sky
The ultimate act of intervention
No other
option left but to retaliate
Drawn to attack the source
The origin
eradicated
Confronted with reptilian coldness
If not from me
Then someone
else will sell this
Never accept that this
Is just an act of fate
The angers
boiling down
Into absolute hate
Crimson flames
Against the darkened sky
The
ultimate act of intervention
No other option left but to retaliate
Drawn to
attack the source
The origin eradicated
Doused and set ablaze
Scales of
justice raised
Every meth lab burned
Crimson flames
Against the darkened
sky
The ultimate act of intervention
No other option left but to
retaliate
Drawn to attack the source
The origin eradicated
