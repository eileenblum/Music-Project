The recklessness
The senselessness
It's insidious
This is what horrifies

3600 pounds of steel
Accelerates
Victims lost intoxicated
All his mistake
Crushed to death or left paralyzed

The recklessness
The senselessness
It's insidious
This is what horrifies

A mother's instincts
Overpowered
By the ferocity
Of addiction
Carinogens inhaled
Leave her baby poisoned
When what is done is done
It affects everyone
Addict's live crumbles
Can't function or care
Abandons his family
Caught in a snare
Others dragged down
As they're pulled in
A tangled mess of disasters

The recklessness
The senselessness
It's insidious
This is what horrifies
