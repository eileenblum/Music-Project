The weapons and drugs of dealers
Kill more in months and weeks
Than all of Al-Qaeda's victims
For the cartel's greed
Their numbers equivalent
To an invading force
Violent drug gangs are terrorists
Track the chaos to its source
Terror tactics bribery
Torture an murder
Forced into a fearful silence
In a one-sided war

Security Threat number one
Security Threat number one

Collaborators betray
Till the system fails
Tally up the death toll
On a global scale
The body count rises
Overdoses and accidents
Bullets kill both innocents
And law enforcement

Security Threat number one
Security Threat number one

Don't tell me it's just a choice
Don't tell me it expands minds
Don't tell me it doesn't harm
Don't tell me anyone else
