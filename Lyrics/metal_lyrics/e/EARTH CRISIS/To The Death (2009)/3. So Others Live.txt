Demented technology
Devised for the slaughter
Sentient beings' blood
Spills in frigid water
Harpoons pierce flesh and bone
Explosives detonate
Senseless killings continue
A sickening fate

Trivial excuses can't justify
The sane filled with rage
No reasons for these creatures to die

Waning numbers fade in seas
clouded with pollution
Pursued to the earth's end
To near extinction
Wailing fleet confronted
In harm's way at risk
The daring intervene
Courage passes its test

Trivial excuses can't justify
The sane filled with rage
No reasons for these creatures to die

The last line of defense to save a species
Shepherd's safety forfeit
So others live
Now the carnage is challenged

Demented technology
Devised for the slaughter
Sentient beings' blood
Spills in frigid water
Harpoons pierce flesh and bone
Explosives detonate
Senseless killings continue
A sickening fate
