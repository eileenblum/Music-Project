Beneath the glare
Days of agony are spent
Caged, chained or penned
Above a floor of wire fence
Every basic right denied
Even the freedom of movement
Inescapable insanity
Dominates every moment
Enslaved and entombed
I disengage the death machine
species torn from nature
individuals decreased
from living beings no nothing more
than mechaniced protein machines
calves seized from their mothers
confined in veal crates
Meat, dairy industries connect
To end with the same fate
Enslaved and entombed
I disengage the death machine
Boxcars, stockyards - the killing floor
decapitated in the abattoir
partake suffer the consequence
anthropocentric arrogance
Beneath the glare
Days of agony are spent
Caged, chained or penned
Above a floor of wire fence
Every basic right denied
Even the freedom of movement
Inescapable insanity
Dominates every moment
Vegan for life
Vegan to the death
