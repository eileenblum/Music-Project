They betrayed us all
Lambs that weep for the release
Of murderous wolves
Lunatics extort from us
To placate parasites
Loyal to nothing
Just as they
Were programmed to be
Mindlessness lost to excess in their vanity
The heel is bearing down on our throats
This is when slaves are
Forced to revolt
A lethal threat
Has been imposed
Now must defend
Fight back
With steel in my hand
History distorted every triumph defeated
The flaws magnified until
The ideal is left weakened
The heel is bearing down on our throats
This is when slaves are
Forced to revolt
A lethal threat
Has been imposed
Now must defend
Fight back
With steel in my hand
Trapped in the ruins of
A failed experiment
Discard their illusions
Break out of the ruins of
A failed experiment
Discard their illusions
The heel is bearing down on our throats
This is when slaves are
Forced to revolt
A lethal threat
Has been imposed
Now must defend
Fight back
With steel in my hand
