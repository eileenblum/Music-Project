The hand of death is lifted
Across the land
The blight exterminates
None able to withstand
Demonic misanthropes
Unseen killing wins
Intentionally set
Upon humanity
Airborne agents infect
From the contagions inhaled
The particles transmit
Till immune system fails

Lives taken slowly
As the sickness spreads
No cure to defend
No cure to reverse
One by one - struck down
Nations end, cities fall
With the silent dead
Nations end, cities fill
With the silent dead

Man's creations collapse
Under the elements
Buildings slowly crumble
Away in the stillness

Lives taken slowly
As the sickness spreads
No cure to defend
No cure to reverse
One by one - struck down
Nations end, cities fall
With the silent dead
Nations end, cities fill
With the silent dead

The skyline decays
Now nature reclaims the earth
Vegetation returns
Civilizations fade
Birds above beasts below
Urbanscape unreconizable
Through broken canyons
Streams flow free
Fractured streets are filled with trees
Moss covered concrete
In ruins
In the absence of humans

Their lives taken slowly
As sickness spreads
No cure to defend
No cure to reverse
One by one - struck down
Nations end, cities fall
With the silent dead
Nations end, cities fill
With the silent dead
