I know you want to be free and get away from there
I know you will feel stronger than you did before
Your situation is still too complicated to be
so easily understood by your family
Call me when you feel to speak to me
You know I will be always here to care of you
Tell me sister can I help you somehow?
Do you still remember the fun that we shared? - oh yeah

Her war is over
Don't give her reasons to fight
she's going nowhere
keeping her mind instigated against the world
She's getting away from a bad time
And wants to keep on getting more
and more of this serenity
Don't crush her emotional side
She has enough of your every single try
to understand her when it was too late

Sister, you're not alone
Sister, trust in me
Your daughter she's growing on
and will give you more than peace.
