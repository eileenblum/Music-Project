Innocenceâs gone way too easy
And you donât know how to face it
See your frail happiness
Is broken down by your desire
Tell me what to do
Tell me what to say
âCos I donât really know it
Everywhere I go seems so far away
But you donât care about it
I am so scared about you
Because I donât know you at all
Will you care
As much as I will?
