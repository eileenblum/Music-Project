I donât think you may feel it
I donât believe you do
I donât want you to think youâve got the right to rescue
The hideous side of me
âCos I know who I am
And youâre about to discover
Something you too
Could not be holding all alone
Could not be standing it so long
Could not be telling anybody
How you feel inside your heart
And why youâre wishing it to go
But why the hell you?
You donât think I may feel it
You donât believe I do
You donât want me to think Iâve got the right to rescue
The hideous side of you
âCos you know who you are
And Iâm about to discover
Something me too
Could not be holding all alone
Could not be standing it so long
Could not be telling anybody
How I feel inside
Is anybody going really crazy?
Is there anything I could expect from this?
Feels like a prison I cannot escape from
Like a virus I get infected with
Is anybody going really crazy?
Is there anything I could expect from this?
Feels like a prison I cannot escape from
Like a virus I get infected with
Is anybody going really crazy?
Is there anything I could expect from this?
Feels like a prison I cannot escape from
Like a virus I get infected with
