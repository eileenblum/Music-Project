I donât want to stay
I try for everything I care
I will not be trained
âCos I refuse to be swayed
I breakaway
From each and every burden of pain
I wonât bag you care
Although my headâs ready
I think Iâm losing all I need
To keep my mind strong for this trip
Something you donât want to see
Someone you donât want to be
