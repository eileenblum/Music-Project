Iâm trying to see
But thereâs nothing to look at
Iâm trying to give
But thereâs no one to care about
Iâm crucifying myself
For something I donât know
Confusing my way with another I donât want to walk
Iâm trying to give you my saving
Iâm trying to save you from my daze
Iâm laying the doubts of my memory
Iâm dying for you
But you donât really know I do
Iâm trying to see
But thereâs nothing to look at
Iâm trying to give
But thereâs no one to care about
Iâm crucifying myself
For something I donât know
Confusing my way with another I donât want to walk
