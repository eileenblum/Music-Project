So I get entrapped into this weakness
I never thought that I could feel this way
I never thought that I could find the way
To let you know Iâm healing
But once again Iâm gonna bleeding
And I donât know how to get out
It is startling
The way you bring me pain
Even though youâre gonna call my name
Brings me fever and I canât turn a hair at all
Whatever you may say itâs fake
I feel so tired
And I need breakaway
It is startling
The way you bring me pain
Even though youâre gonna call my name
Brings me fever and I canât turn a hair at all
Whatever you may say itâs fake
Like a virus, you bring me feverâ¦
