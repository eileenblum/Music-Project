Afraid of seeing
Afraid of being blind
Afraid of believing
Afraid of being wise
Thereâs no way to handle this
Afraid of losing
Afraid of succeeding
Afraid of feeling
Afraid of being dying
Thereâs no way to handle this
Afraid of crying
Afraid of smilinâ
Afraid of frozing
Afraid of burning
Thereâs no way to handle thisâ¦
I just want to be free
I just want to be free
But I feel misbecoming
But I feel misbecoming
So tell me how
How to fly away
âCos I just want to be me
