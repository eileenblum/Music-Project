Plenty of emotions
Surrounding my way
Tons of frustrations
Covering my brain
I know nothing is as it seems
I know
Iâm drowning in a seaâ¦
Iâm missing my oxygen
Thereâs no oxygen here
I need help, you seeâ¦
Underwater I cannot breathe
Underwater I cannot speak
Underwater I can only sleep
Sleep, sleep
It is youâre time
What is this? Now I can breathe again
What is this? Now I can see it
Because I open my eyes on time
Sleep, sleep
It is your time now
I know itâs your time
Not mineâ¦
