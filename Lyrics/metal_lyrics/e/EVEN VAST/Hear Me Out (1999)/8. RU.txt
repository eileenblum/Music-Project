I can feel you
With my hands I touch you
Oh my ru
Can't you feel me?
In your water can't you see
Like I do?
When I found you
For the first time I thought:

- You are my Ru -
Don't you know
That I left it all for you
My Ru
I can feel you
With my hands I touch you
Oh my Ru
'Cause you are my Ru

Now I feel
I have to flow away
In you
And I feel
I have to follow you
My Ru
Yes I feel
I need to flow away in you.
