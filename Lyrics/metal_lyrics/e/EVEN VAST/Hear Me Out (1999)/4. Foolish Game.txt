I feel down again
But you don't understand
'Cause you don't know
Who I am
You kill me
Before I can explain
How I feel inside
Against me
You turn
Indifferent to my pain
Indifferent to my tears
You kill me
You take my life away
You push me down
Against me
You turn
Indifferent to my pain
Indifferent to my tears

I don't know how to feel now
Inside
My mind is changing
I don't want to believe that
You kill
My feelings for nothing
I don't believe you will hurt me
Again
'Cause I'm growing and changing
Anyway I won't let you
Destroy
What I save from your foolish game

Nohing stays the same and nothing
will come back
But I don't forget you have hurt me
There's nothing left to fight for
No one to comply
With your wishes and with your absurdity.
