You can't control this
-a neverending pain-
You never cared too mach
About me man
You cannot stand this
-but I'm shaking off my chains-
You don't like to see this
New light in my eyes
No veils on my face
No fears in my mind
And now I'm used to lokking you
Fixedly in the eyes
And I swear to myself
You'll never hear me say:

"I feel so lonely tonight
And I wish that I could die
Too much cold is this place
And I think I won't survive
I feel badly hurt tonight
Cannot really stand this pain
Too many tears are in my eyes
I need love to make them wiped"

But I say you are foolish
If you do think that I can be
Such a stupid
And you cannot forget this
'Cause I'm taking my first steps
To a new life
You consumed my emotions
Treading on them as if
Nothing were the matter
I can't tell you how long I've suffered
But it helped me
In getting stronger
Now I swear there's something
You will never hear me say
Swear something you will never hear me!
