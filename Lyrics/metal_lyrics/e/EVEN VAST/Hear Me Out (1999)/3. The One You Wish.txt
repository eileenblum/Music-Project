I don't want to forgive you
For all you have done
I don't want to believe you
Your time has come
I don't know if you care but
I won't be there
When you will get my response
With all of my rage, yeah!

I don't want to be the one you wish
I don't know why you still persist
In your stupid lies and nasty things
Don't know what to do with your apologies

It's time to wake up and open your mind
To a different way in living your life
Maybe you will realize that
I won't be longer the object of your lies

You know I am so tired
No longer I1ll resist
Just listening to your lies
Without really getting sick
You know my rage is growing
You know my hate is deep
I am so cold inside
And you're not the one I wish.
