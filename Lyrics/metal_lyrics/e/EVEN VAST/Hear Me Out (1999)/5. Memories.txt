When I've closed my eyes
Not to see your face
And I've stopped to trust in you
Then I've plugged my ears
Not to hear your words
And I've guessed right you too
Had to face it out
With all of your force
But you couldn't know the truth
Yes I didn't open my heart to you
'Cause my heart is broken too

I won't be there
When memories will come back to you
And I won't be there
'Cause memories will come back for you.
