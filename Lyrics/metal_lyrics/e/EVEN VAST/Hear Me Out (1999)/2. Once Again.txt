Im trying to forgive myself
For every slip I made
But everything reminds me them
Trying to forget the past
To put the things apart
Why don't you try to realize
I'm dying deep inside again
This time will be the last one
But you don't understand me
Now I'm trying to find my way
And realize I have to try again

Tonight I'm changing
Feeling like never felt before
I am healing myself from every wound
I am getting hidden from shadozs no more

I've tasted the fear
On my knees I've stayed for years
And now I'm learning how to get free
Learning how to be
What you will never be
Now that you see
Who I am it's yours that fear
'Cause now I'm learning how to get free
Leaning how to be
What you will never be.
