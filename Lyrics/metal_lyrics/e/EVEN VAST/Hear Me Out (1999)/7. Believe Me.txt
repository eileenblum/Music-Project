I believe in myself
I believe in my skills
All I have to do is to change my life
Living it in a better way
I can begin to dream again
Everyday
Cleaning out my past from my mind

Wanna be somebody, yeah
Not living in the shade
Beginning to smile again, yeah
Now everything is alright
Everything in my life
Seems to be so fine
And if you don't believe me, baby
I don't care

I don't forget the eyes
Of a man who cried
For your stupid lies

I couldn't save my mind
I never had that chance
Here's nothing I can change
I have to try again.
