Touch me with your hands now
Let me feel these things
I never felt before
Look me in the eyes now
Let me see these things
I never saw before
Walk with me forever
Yeah, walk with me forever
I don't want more
Touch me with your hands now
Oh let me feel these things
I never felt before

Find the reason to believe in me
Find the nerve to tell me what you feel
I just wanna be the friend you need

You take me on
And I think
You will always be my

Energy and extasy, my energy

I need you to take me on
And I think
You will always be my

Energy
I never will forget your love
Extasy
A strange emotion on my own
Energy
It comes from everything, you know
Energy
That's what you're giving me

I need you to
Take me on
And now I think you
Will always be
My secret dream 'cause
You badly won my soul
And now I think
You will always be my
Ebergy, and extasy.
