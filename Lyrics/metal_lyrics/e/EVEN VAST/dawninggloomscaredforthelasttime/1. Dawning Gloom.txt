I wish you could feel what I could not
When I was fool, when I was you
I wish you knew that I loved you
Although you looked so sad and far away

It's the way you are
That makes me down
There we are
For the final booze
Where is the love
And the happiness
I've dreamt for so long
That you promised me

I wish you could feel what I could not
When I was fool, when I was you
I wish you knew that I loved you
Although you looked so sad and far away

Are you feeling my pain within
Are you crying for what you've seen
Are you filling it all with
With irony, eh?
