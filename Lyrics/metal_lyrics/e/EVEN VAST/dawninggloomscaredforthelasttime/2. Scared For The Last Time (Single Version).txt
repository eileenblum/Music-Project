There is a place that I have seen
While following my dream
Where I have lost my mind and I've seen
This reality so clear
I see no reason to pretend
I'm not losing all I have
There is no reason to pretend
I feel scared...

Don't tell me it's hard to be
The one you want to be
Don't tell me it's hard to see
The things you want to see
Don't tell me it's hard to feel
Feelings you want to feel
Don't look me in the eyes
It wouldn't be honest to me
Don't tell me anything
I know yet, my dear
Don't tell me anything
I don't want to hear

You know I feel so scared
For the last time
You know I feel so scared
For the last time
You know I feel so scared
For the last time
You know I feel so scared
For the last time

Don't tell me it's hard to be
The one you want to be
Don't tell me it's hard to see
The things you want to see
Don't tell me it's hard to feel
Feelings you want to feel
Don't look me in the eyes
It wouldn't be honest to me
Don't tell me anything
I know yet my dear
Don't tell me anything
I don't want to hear

Don't tell me anything
I don't want to hear
Don't tell me anything
I don't want to hear
Don't tell me anything
I don't want to hear...
