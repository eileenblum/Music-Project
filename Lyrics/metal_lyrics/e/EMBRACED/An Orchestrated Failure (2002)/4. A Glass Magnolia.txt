Over the hills came a sudden roar,
And in place of my smile it left a sore
A sore so big it engulfed my lip
And no one came to ask a kiss
And no such kiss will ever come
In a pool we built to drown someone
Swim with your eyes open to see what things there are to save you and
Me.
go

Lord save our voices for a terminal fight
Lord, save our, our voices, terminal fight

Go your way i'll be fine
It's just like you to leave me behind
