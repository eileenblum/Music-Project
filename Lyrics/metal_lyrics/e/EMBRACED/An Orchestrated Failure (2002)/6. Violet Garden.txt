Its your last
So save your breath

Your words your lies
I'm sick to death

You're ugly ways
Have left me dry

&gt;From my seat right here
I'll watch you die

I cant live this way,
My head is vexed
With all the things that you relay

Go your way
I'll be fine
It's just like you
To leave me behind

My better days
Put in a box
With the seal of you
Upon the lock

I see you now
Loud and clear

Your looks so sharp
I can hardly hear

In this violet garden of lust

Save on me, play on me
You are a fallacy

Now it's on my face
The look of your disgrace
I'll play that card of fear
My wounds i will to sear
