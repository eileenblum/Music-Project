I'll make it rain down on me, the water makes me feel so free,
All you seem to be, is content wit your reality,
What you need is a place to stay, with out all those pictures and pictures
I wish i could make him pay, but hes bought with those singles the singles
And oh to live another day, with this grace that turns to gray,
So have mercy on my future now, your humor seems to me so low brow, your 
voice is at a scream, but i Dont hear a thing.

Be careful what you leave by the wayside,
You will cease the need to dream,
And all of those you hold dear in life,
Will cut you up and make you bleed,
Bleed that blood of green
You will cease the need to dream

Cease to dream
