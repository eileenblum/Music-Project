This winters colder than before,
And my tears freeze on my face,
The ice turns my cheeks blue,
And tears my skin when removed
You dont see me
You dont see through these games we play
You dont see through these games that we play all day
You see my face, it stands alone, and these things we break,
Are set in stone
You dont see me or my self
