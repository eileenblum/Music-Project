It was a glorius kingdom
Where life a long time ago
was lived in total harmonius serenity

Wings spread wide open
Carried by the wind over oceans wide
A timeless journey in the endless light
Brought to another dimension
Escaping from the thoughts of a blackened wind
My dreams are captured
Imprisoned to die and be forever forgotten

Tears are falling from my eyes
Carving rivers down my cheek
Turning cold and hard as ice
Crumbling into the sea of lies

Running in circles, screaming in vain
Eternal suffering, eternal pain
Forever lost my faith in all
Forever found my darkest call
Spreading my wings once again in the sky
Disappear like an arrow shot in the dark
Screaming for vengeance, a shadow no more
Hunting the angels of my past

Vanished... the angels came

Heading back towards a forgotten paradise
Once magnificent before the angels came

An almost forgotten place from an ancient era
Lies silence filled with dredful memories
Returning to cast upon them revenge
And tear their souls apart
My tears are gone
Yet the pain inside wont leave me alone

I came to sense in dismay
Awakened by years of hate
This dismal era
Has got to face it's final apocalypse

Wings spread wide open
Carried by the wind over oceans wide
A timeless journey in the endless light
Brought to another dimension
Escaping from the thoughts of a blackened wind
My dreams are captured
Imprisoned to die and be forever forgotten
Forever forgotten...
