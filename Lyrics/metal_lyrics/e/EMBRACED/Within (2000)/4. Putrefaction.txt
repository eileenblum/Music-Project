Putrefaction, hurry oh beloved bride
To establish our lonely camp
Rejected by the world, rejected by god
My hope, lies in you

Take my paining body into the wonder of you
Smother my pain in your embrace
Worms devour thought and feeling

Take my paining body into the wonder of you
Smother my pain in your embrace
Worms devour thought and feeling

Hasten, decorate our chamber
For on a scootblack bier the silent lover
your dwelling shall reach
So hasten, prepare our bridal bed
Which shall sow with carnactions

To wonderful gratification, stifling bewitchment
Us black attired comrades followeth
Our wedding march ringeth from iron bells
And shrouds of green draperies hideth us

When storms ravish the worldly seas
When atrocities reign on the bloodfilled earth
When feuds are raging, we slumber thou and I
In contented peace

Take my paining body into the wonder of you
Smother my pain in your embrace
Worms devour thought and feeling

Take my paining body into the wonder of you
Smother my pain in your embrace
Worms devour thought and feeling

To ash in my ravished heart
Oh rich are you, wench, whom I dowry
Giveth me the great, the flourishing earth
Up here, do I suffer, though happines overcomes me
In the nether with you
