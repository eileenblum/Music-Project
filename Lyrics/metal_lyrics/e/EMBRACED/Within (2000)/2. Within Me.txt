Lost in myself thoughts goes around
Floats in a mind hard to understand
Paralyzed by dreams impossible to reach
Far away but yet so near

A burning light far within me
I want to burn but it might die
Disappointed at life I struggle on
I reach out far, as far as I can get

I want to get up start burning again
Somewhere far away it's still glowing
But the fire that once burned
Is now cold and dead
I have to bring it back to life
Get a grip climb up again

A burning light far within me
I want to burn but it might die
Disappointed at life I struggle on
I reach out far, as far as I can get

I tumble in the dark, trying to get a grip
A grip of life, I want to turn right

A burning light far within me
I want to burn but it might die
Disappointed at life I struggle on
I reach out far, as far as I can get
