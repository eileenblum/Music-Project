I am the beholder
Of what the future might bring
Have no longer a part in
The belief of our blood divine
No matter what choices I make
They are now a part in my life
Dark impressions surrounding my mind
As they enter in my subconscious

It feels like I am cursed and sentenced
Banished away from this realm
They stole what was left of me
Rang the curfew of life

I asked for answers
But all I got was lies
Perhaps they didnt mean it that way
But still...
Frightened by their presence
Denied their existance for years
But as my knowledge grew older
I realised they have examined me piece by piece

In this era of changes
I cannot remember my past
My dreams and memories
An essenial part of me
Years of struggling
To figure out when they arrived
I found the horrible truth
In this era of changes

I smell the brimstone
I can see the owl
They are all around me
Watching every step I take
My mind rejects the scenario
Overwhelmed by fear
Too vast for me to grip or handle
My mind chooses the easy way out

"They have been here for centuries, perhaps since
The beginning of time, and have in silence been
manipulating the genetic evolution of our breed.
Documents of their presence, their part in
The scientific revolution found as way back
as in the time of the ancient sumerians."

I can't take no more
I can't handle the truth
I'm losing controll
I'm losing my mind

In this era of changes
I cannot remember my past
My dreams and memories
An essenial part of me
Years of struggling
To figure out when they arrived
I found the horrible truth
In this era of changes
