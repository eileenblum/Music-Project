In the dead of the night
Where the tides of exsistence
Silently seems to float away
She appears again my queen of beauty

She is the one in my dreams
Who lights my burning desires
She is the one in my dreams
With whom I share
My carnal lust
And all my sinful desires
She is the one in my dreams
Who I am ready to die for

The bringer of passion
And the bringer of my destiny

It's a nighttime drama
Of beauty and passion
Dreams and desires
Yet so fatal and tragic

In the dead of the night
Where the tides of exsistence
Seems to float away

My queen and I are soon together as one

It's a nighttime drama
Of beauty and passion
Dreams and desires
Yet so fatal and tragic

A moment of pure divinity
Sweeps over my body and soul
But as I reach out to touch her
The spell is broken and I see her face

Seduced by evil
Disguised in beauty
My soul is now forever forlorn

My journey has reached its fatal end
Cold, bitter darkness
Surrounds me as I lay down to sleep

Eternally...

And so it's written
The final chapter
Of a nighttime drama
So fatal and tragic

The bringer of passion
And the bringer of my destiny

It's a nighttime drama
Of beauty and passion
Dreams and desires
Yet so fatal and tragic
