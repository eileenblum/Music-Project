As I slowly close my eyes
I can see what I once had
Screaming out loud but no one hears
Surrounded by emptiness
I clench my teeth to hold back the tears

The fire that burned is now dying down
I cannot hope no more
Do not dare to believe
Erased emotions, denial of lust
I fear the pain of being left alone

Lies to myself, just want to forget
Years of joy turns to despair
Tries to get through the mist of love
And I cry along the way

Thoughts goes around in my bitter mind
Confused, tries to understand
My soul is empty, Im dying inside
I want to find the path that leads back to life
