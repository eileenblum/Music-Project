My blood I gave to thee my love
So pale and beautiful
My creature of the night

Darkness calls you to me
Enchanting eyes cold as ice
Looking right through me

My soul you took away

Kisses filled me, emptying me of my being

My luscios vampire
You beauty of night
Take my hand and lead me
To the grave of light

Rivers of blood
Running from your eyes
Oh why, my love
Cant you take me
Oh why, my love
Wont you slay me

So pale and beautiful
My creature of the night
Take my soul and lead me into twilight
