As I roam along the path
Between life and death
Shattered dreams
Seem to be all there is left

So please bring me forth
And show me the way
Be my guide and lead me right

Bursting out in tears
As the agony lays heavy on my shoulders
And misery burns like a fever inside me

Memories that should be buried and forgotten
Haunts me when I sleep
An emotionally devastating nightmare
That never seems to end

This tragedy in wich I live
Harvest the last pieces
That are left of my miserable soul
This endless sorrow of mine devours me slowly
So please bring me forth
And show me the way
Be my guide and lead me right
