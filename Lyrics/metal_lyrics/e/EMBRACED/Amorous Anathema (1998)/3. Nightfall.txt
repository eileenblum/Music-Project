The night is falling over the darkest souls
Infinity is calling out
To everyone who knows the pain of hearts broken
The agony of one word spoken
A story told of suffering and pain
Of love and hate
A lullaby of lies and blame

A time of dreams we shared
The love we made on the darkest night
Shining through the shallow mind
Deceiving voices telling lies
The truth never spoken
An endless choir of sighs

Sun is rising on another day
Watching shadows disappear
Whispered secrets in the shallow mind
Screaming, crying, missing, fear

Night is falling over the darkest souls
