The beautiful flow
Of an autumn passion
Silently embraces In its mistful darkness

The october moon
Spreads its pale dim light
Like a silken caress
Over the midnight landscape

The beautiful flow
Of an autumn passion
So pure and vast
Like the sky of an october night

In an almost mysterious tranquillity
A glorious moment of passion
Takes its shape
In the great season of tragedy

The beautiful flow
Of an autumn passion
Silently embraces
In its mistful darkness

The beautiful flow of an autumn passion
