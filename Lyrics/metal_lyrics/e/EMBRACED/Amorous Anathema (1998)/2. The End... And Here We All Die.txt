Guilty, guilty as sin
Guilty of putrefaction
Feels it tearing up the heart and soul
Of the world that I once knew

I blame you humanity
Now its gone
The world is crying
And here we all die

Leaving footprints filled with despair
Storming through what was so beautiful
All I see is ashes of life and beauty

You will never see another day

Marching like thousands of soldiers
Destroying everything
The sun turns black in front of my eyes
The moon is crying

A disease without vaccin
Spreads like wildfire
I call you guilty
But do you know what it is

I blame you
You are guilty
Guilty of putrefaction
This is the end
