In the distance
Of the night side
Drown in the blur
Gone we are

Restful on my wave
I know we'll reach the final tide
Hold your fear, follow me
Our season came

Soar, unbind your trance
Open wide your wings, for this is our chance
The skies here are the answer
The seas now will reveal our eyes
One last time
Soar, release your sense
Retrieve the dream, where horizons shiver
Reshape your own reality
The arcanes of life will only remain
One last time

Renounce to delusion
Be yourself, no matter the loss
Unleashing your reason
Your very own being should glow

Just a second
To stare another light
A different radiance, bound to another star

Behind the walls of illusion
Slumber myriads of clear dimension
We're just leaving this one
For another

Soar, unbind your trance
Open wide your wings, for this is our chance
The skies here are the answer
The seas now will reveal our eyes
One last time
Soar, release your sense
Retrieve the dream, where horizons shiver
Reshape your own reality
The arcanes of life will only remain
In our mind

... life will only remain in our mind
