Painfully awakened
Again bound to this gloom
I no longer discern what's real or lie

I'm lost in my sight

Rays of haze everywhere around me
I'm breaching the stream,
Tracing the trail
Of my core
Far away from what seems to be
I'm forging the day
Shaping the realm
Of my core
I fall in the Dreamtide

I can feel all my senses
A Presence by my side
One second of eternity where I now thrive
Another season for another tide

Rays of haze everywhere around me
I'm breaching the stream,
Tracing the trail
Of my core
Far away from what seems to be
I'm forging the day
Shaping the realm
Of my core
I drift into space

Waves of fate circle my feelings
Constantly
The days over here are different
This stillness of mind
This quietude in the air
I'm waking along the shores of existence
I dive deeper and deeper
Into the cosmic ocean
Purging my will to return ethereal
I won't come back from my Dream

...I'm out of this World
