We dreamt once of eternity
When our words were devoid of sense
We were frail, inclined to hate
Our weakness bound to our shell
Drowning to be, sentenced to fail
No belief, no hope left
We simply were becoming our own shade
Our own shade

This place is far
From the shelter I dwell in
Freed from my mind
I shiver a deeper state
No longer aside, relieved again
Reaching the stars
I'm longing for the tidal trance

A wave we may leave
The seas have no end
Passion may ease, yet my storm won't rest
Unblinding my will from its organic chains
Breaching the skies for one final dance
