Just another winter
Another season, where we have forgotten
The meaning of life
The reason why we are

Just another turn
Another day that remains unanswered
The distrust that binds
Those minutes that never pass
Yet we are there

Somehow this time lapse may leave us a legacy
The pulses of existence may collapse
But will never fade
Our origins will echo forever
From now on I no more feel lost
The night sky is so clear
The mind was an illusion
I'm only real in the moment
Our origins will echo forever

We were searching for the truth
With our closed eyes
We just had to listen... with our heart
We just had to open
To the moment
