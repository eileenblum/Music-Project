Haze
Just the hollow
Of a lonely dawn
Left with the horizon
As our only hope

Grace seeds our fate
In this day of solace and sorrow
Pale is our realm
As we're facing the last rising sun
Come, come with me
Today we leave to end it all
To release ourselves eternal

Safe yet cold
We stray alone
Safe yet cold
We rain our blazing hope

Grace seeds our fate
In this day of solace and sorrow
Pale is our realm
As we're facing the last rising sun
Come, come with me
Today we leave to end it all
To release ourselves eternal
