So this is how we ascend
Across the tunnel of light
I feel the tide around me
The days of our lifetime are gone

Your lines vanish afar
I call your name in vain
Silence breaks us apart
Whereas you reach the other side

The cycle of light blurs the distance
As the motion of time raises our soul
We prevail as one
Within this dual existence
The ions of stars that we share
Expire the might
From where we all come
We expand as one
Within this dual existence

We exhale our form
To cover new skies

As suns
We merge until the end
To shine brighter like a nova
We irradiate our way
To open on a new world

We cast our rays afar
To reshape our fate
New dimensions we cross
We disperse our will
To transcend our dawn

The cycle of light blurs the distance
As the motion of time raises our soul
We prevail as one
Within this dual existence
The ions of stars that we share
Expire the might
From where we all come
We expand as one
Within this dual existence
