One sealed black window 
One only frame to the outside 
So many days, so many years 
Lost in this fading slumber 
You are connected, to the world above us 
This is a new step down in your life 
Follow your fate, unleash your mind 

You feel me time to time 
Every night you repeal your will 
Come... Come to me... 
Release yourself, let you dawn 

Forlorn in your cell 
ThereÂ´s no daylight to hope 
All these voices you hear 
Like a child in a crowd 
Unblinded by your own fear 
You start to see by your eyes 
Spellbound by your new sense 
Unbind your chains 
Ride freedom, once again 

Leave your fears, reach the skies beyond 
Let yourself lead your insight 
Leave your fears, reach the skies beyond 
YouÂ´re no longer part of this world
