Dust on my feet, rust on my name
The melody suddenly ends
As motion seems to lie
With my remains
Stars are aligned, reflecting as one
On the mirror close to my frame
Refracting on my side
The realm of all fate

Gone, yet still alive
Left for another day, another sight 
Another face of life

The rays are colder behind
The light out there
Turned the blaze to white
And my night to a restful slumber

In this parallel dimension
I leave my painful hollow
Everything just flows
And I drift in rapture

So I reach my own demise
In this maze of emotions
What we call Divine

So I reach my own demise
In this maze of emotions
What we call Mind
