Can you heal the scars?
Can you feel this wave
Consuming your rage
As the storm cries from afar
Disrupting your unconscious rest

The soil stills, frozen
Unstable clouds arise
From grey to amber
The horizon bends its line
Drifting fragile notes
Merge your name to mine
As we wander
For the last time

Can you hear the signs?
Can you feel this haze
Enveloping your face
As the cold distant star
Caresses your fear in blaze
One by one, every road fades
Left alone, on your own
All your tracks collapse
Your day has come to resurrect
Revive your dawn
On the lightning rays

Reveal to me your heart
Clear the rime of your foresight
Dry the stream of your loneliness
To hold the shade that we saw behind
On the shores of this hovering thunder
Entwined as one in the eyes of winter
We're riding against the tide
Spellbound in the Nightwave
