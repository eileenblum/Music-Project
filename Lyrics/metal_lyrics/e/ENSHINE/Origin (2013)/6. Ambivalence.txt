On a road, alone
I stray in the distance
I've left my life above
Into haze

And I walk
Further nowhere
And I wander
In what's left of me

Where the sky shines stronger
Across the amber clouds
Where the tide turns deeper
Along the lakes of hope
I'm dawning in a serene world

No more tied to time
No longer aimed to fall
No more howling past
No longer in a fading role

Where the sky shines stronger
Across the amber clouds
Where the tide turns deeper
Along the lakes of hope
I'm dawning in the Afterglow
