Will daylight come
When my life will end?

All around the storm
All beyond the grey
Serenity called me
In a silent haze
Following the glow
I feel the heat of the divine flame

I can see the other shore
As my reason seems to fade
I can touch the amber clouds

As I lead my soul
To the shining slostice
As I lead my soul (as I lead my soul...)
To the winter sunrays

Life ends in a brighter world
