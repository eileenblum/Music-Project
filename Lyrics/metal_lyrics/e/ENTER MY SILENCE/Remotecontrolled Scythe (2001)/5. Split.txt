Your shallow approach for all is crushing me into a trillion shreds
I refuse to become a side-effect, so take what's yours and go...
Why can't I be of same false soul?
Why can't I be the beast behind those enthralling eyes?

Whore...you lift me up in to charms of dyonesia, and tear me
down at the threshold of my ultimate, glamorous peak

"Frustration is the outstanding emotion as I curse my pitiful fate"

Redeemed? Maybe not, but I still recognize myself
despite the scenes you built to lure me
Redeemed! At last a time to reconstruct myself
But what's the use for redemption if the outcome is this:
"Aggressive creature, a fiend to all, even my shadow, it hates..."

What's the use for redemption if the outcome is this:
"Forefront bitterness, a fiend to all..."
What's the use for redemption if it makes me a savage-like beast?
