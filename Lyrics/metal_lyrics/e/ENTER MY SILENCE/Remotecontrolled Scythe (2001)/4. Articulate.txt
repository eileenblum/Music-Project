Your eyes are broad, but the vision's narrow
Your words are wide, but the effect's trivial...
Never a thought for the most certain fact:
there's something under the thinnest scratch...

Stable smile means no life,
the RC scythe stays tuned tonight

Self-implied god; a standard
The words you escape will strangle you...
Never a glance at the most certain fact:
there's a whole different world inside the plastic surface

Stable smile means no life,
the RC scythe stays tuned tonight

Swallow the gift - spit out the useless
But read this clear:
"I am the d-cell inside death"
...and we articulate correctly, until perfection...

Stable smile means no life,
the RC scythe stays tuned tonight

You stole my tongue and asked me speak
You told me to lie and did not believe my words,
so I'll isolate, withdraw, enjoy...
As the RC scythe stays tuned tonight
