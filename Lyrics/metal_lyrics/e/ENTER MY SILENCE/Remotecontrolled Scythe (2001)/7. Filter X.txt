Placed in the most vulnerable place we can bear
Creating illusions which adhere from this moment to the last
What a perfect lie... maintained by the X that dwells inside

We cannot kill it, can't live without it,
it burns like a fire, it stains like a curse
Corroding cavity through our minds
Controlling us, filter X

Affecting our human core with the most dangerous way;
deleting principles we dear
Replacement; a circuit that operates with rigid preciseness
and eventually we are all connected

We cannot kill it, can't live without it,
it burns like a fire, it stains like a curse
Controlling frequencies we use to code for assistance
Consuming us, filter X

Their DNA-integrated spine is manipulating us
with reactions usually granted only for protection
against threats that would deny what is man by nature

What a perfect lie, greater than itself...
Reject the impulse from the internal device

Remnants from the time without control
cause an evergaining mourn for the past from this hell
What a perfect lie... protected by the X that dwells inside

We cannot kill it, can't live without it,
it burns like a fire, it stains like a curse
Controlling frequencies we use to code for assistance
Consuming us, filter X
