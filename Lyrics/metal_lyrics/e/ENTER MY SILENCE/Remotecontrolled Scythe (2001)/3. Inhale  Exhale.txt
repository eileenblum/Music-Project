"Flashback by demons of mine vigil waiting for dusk
Eternal hours of celebration, join them to receive this bliss...
Measure the weight of decisive options chosen by them"

Inhale the breath of devil, so mild 
Exhale the breath of an angel, so furious, 
threatening and familiar, so me...

A flashback by demons of mine, they are here; the circle has closed
Eternal hours of despair with them in this bliss known as hell

"The options were never measured, ceremonies never started..."

Inhale the breath of devil, so mild 
Exhale the breath of an angel, so furious, 
threatening and familiar, so me...
The source of them must be suffocated

Some of my demons are longing
Some of my demons are willing to betray!

The entrance in another longitude... proceed to the last divider
Blessed thorns on them... perfect time for final reckoning

With a diabolical halo upon, the key to true vengeance is mine
Inhale the breath of devil, so mild 
Exhale the breath of an angel, so furious, 
threatening and familiar, so me...
The source of them must be suffocated

...exhale the reek of them...
