Remodel substitutes, the dream starts here

If time is stolen one crucial moment disappers
and selections are re-scheduled by odd incidents
Under these timid hopes it doesn't count as we are waiting
something to fill our minds and heal our hearts...

Light my way deeper where the heart remains unexposed
And like this... not a story with a happy ending
can ever take over in real life

Highly strung-out but why to entwine?
To unite our thougths in one massive dream?
Or just face the certain fracture?
Yet, all quaint suggestions are kindly symphatized

Light my way deeper where the heart remains unexposed
And like this... not a story with a happy ending
can ever take over in real life

Remodel substitutes, the dream ends here

Total awakening beyond remotest obscurity
in the aftermath of deepest revealings
Hands tied together in the darkest corner
Where security seems to be eternal...

Was this heart too fragile to be revealed?
And like this... not a story without failing
can ever take effect in real life
Live, lie, love, lose... codes set to fill our minds!

Thanks to devilmessiah for these lyrics.
