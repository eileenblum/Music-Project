Construct... destruct...
My eyes are no eyes, my pain is not pain
These weary hours are my life,
so check the score, it's...

Six-nothing against empty-hearted, still certain of none
Six-nothing against the hollow-souled

Destruct... destruct...
My sixes are none and none is all
This black-dyed truth equals my life,
must adapt to the illogical rules to survive

Misunderstood the ambition, my nails so failed...

Six-nothing against empty-hearted, still certain of none
Six-nothing against the hollow-souled

To endure or to escape?
To leave... for something better?
"Knee-deep in things I did or did not do,
a conscious kill of all I've achieved"
