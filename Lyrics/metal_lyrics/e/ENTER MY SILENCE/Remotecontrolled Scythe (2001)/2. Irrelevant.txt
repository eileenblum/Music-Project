I'm yearning to reveal my burden
For the sake of sympathy, another moment lost
As shown by an ordinary eye;
lenient efforts sink down in to oblivion
and my irrelevance shines completely through

Attacking when I can't defend;
In a sleep beyond The End itself

I am irrelevant for the final of Gods
The entirety can only be seen behind the looking glass,
where an ordinary eye can't see

Not a tremendous sense of delight,
but a scorching flame of nothingness
As the "deep well of forget" floods with
anything even least productive
This is a moment that I never anticipated...

Devotion for these ideas threats my sense-lit road
Infection loaded with pathos; an attack with the most clever of ways

I am irrelevant for the final of Gods
The entirety can only be seen behind the looking glass,
where an ordinary eye can't see

"Devotion for these ideas threats my sense-lit road"
