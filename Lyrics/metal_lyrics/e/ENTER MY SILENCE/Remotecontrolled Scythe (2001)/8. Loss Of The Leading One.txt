Surrounding silence scatters
as we hear the steps of the lonely one
Entering for the last time his atelier of minds...

This haunting figure creates a variety of traits
Those hidden features that otherwise never emerge...
Combined to form a sketch of me,
to concretize the essence of solemn hate

Follow the figure to these ruins - witness the loss

Within every scene of dark tunnels in mind;
every stroke so firm and admirable
"But what inspires the picture of complete loss?
What is the source of neverending grief?"

Follow the figure to these ruins - witness the loss

What it takes to raze the figure inside?
Is it a consent to destroy with him?

Within every scene of dark tunnels in mind;
every stroke so firm and admirable
"But what inspires the picture of complete loss?
What is the source of neverending grief?"

Follow the figure to these ruins - witness the loss
