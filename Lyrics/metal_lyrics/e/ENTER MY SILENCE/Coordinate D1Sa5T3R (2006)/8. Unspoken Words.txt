Distressed by afternoon, a few hours more and
another day has passed serving those fools
They shamelessly feed off my fear
to speak the final word and take back what I hold dear

Fuck their numbers, fuck their synthetic smiles
Those words never came...

I sought comfort from where it was banned
and got caught in a maze of secrecy so grand
My head spins with theories and suspicion,
but my body collects reward

Her eyes spoke to me with lust
Tempting, yet loaded with danger
Loneliness defeated reason and I went down

It's too easy to slip away when no one sees to redeem you
I tried, I fought, but in the end I left behind my sole source of joy

Fuck their mission, there's limits to my patience
Those words never came...

Looking back, I regret my poor resolve
What did I miss and what did I gain?
I tossed integrity for narrow-minded greed
and earned a ticket to a dead-end ride to bliss

Those eyes clouded with tears
I turned down her heartfelt misery
Selfishness defeated emotion and I survived
