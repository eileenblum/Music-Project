This is where I draw the line to separate your views from mine
This is where I draw the line; albeit thin, red and vague

There's a difference between right and wrong,
there is no way to justify your deeds
There's a difference between true and false
that you never seemed to understand

Your corroded mind's playing tricks on you
You failed to see what's pure to realize how much is enough

There's a difference between you and me,
there will not be day when you'll stand tall
In your eyes and in your heart you're weak
and eventually you'll be dragged down

Your corroded mind's playing tricks on you
You failed to see what's pure to realize how much is enough

Different from the start, our paths never crossed
And what I thought we shared
turned out to be a mere pack of lies, poisoning our minds...

Your corroded mind's playing tricks on you
You failed to see what is pure and
to realize how much is enough
