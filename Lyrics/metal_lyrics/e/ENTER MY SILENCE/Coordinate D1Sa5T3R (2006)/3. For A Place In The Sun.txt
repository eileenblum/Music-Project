Worn by the anxious hours
I've wasted under this cloud
that keeps throwing it's load on me
There I stand, wading in rejection...
and when it rains it pours like hell

I will conquer the highest mountain for a place in the sun
Determined, I will shake foundations of everything kept sacred

Behind my crooked smile hide vanity and greed
The two of my dominant traits repress
even the bleakest sign of sympathy...
I will take whoever down

And for those who relied on me,
I offer my deepest apologies
Not because I want to or need to,
but because it is my twisted way to say
I'll be needing you again...

I will conquer the highest mountain for a place in the sun
Determined, I will shake foundations of everything kept sacred
