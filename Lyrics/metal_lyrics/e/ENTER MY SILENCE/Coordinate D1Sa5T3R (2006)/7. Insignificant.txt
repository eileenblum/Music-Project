In these times of indifference,
if you fall you come down hard
IN these times of indifference,
without a shred of decency they stumble on

Join just to be cast aside and abandoned
Forever lost in a crowd of self-centered fools
Where the ultimate challenge is to raise your voice
just enough to be heard but not recognized

Where a cry for help of one is deemed insignificant,
the plight of thousands wont go unheard
And where a single word of sense is denied by selective ears,
the ignorant mumble of masses turns into overwhelming roar...

...that clouds my judgement every day

Pay attention damn it! Don't take a word they say,
do not dive to the depths of incapacity
Where the eyes of once clear-visioned
gradually adapt to the dark that blinds creativity

Where a cry for help of one is deemed insignificant,
the plight of thousands wont go unheard
And where a single word of sense is denied by selective ears,
the ignorant mumble of masses turns into overwhelming roar...

Peel off that hedonist exterior and justify yourselves.
You lived your lives by virtue of nothing, as components of dysfunctional machine
Just deny it all!
