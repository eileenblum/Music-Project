Between their prides and violated homes
stands the dividing wall of mistrust;
transparent, but relentless and cold
Both sides stand firm and reluctant to bring it down

There's no use for words that no one can comprehend
And each mistaken attempt adds another brick to the wall

...and with lips sealed and closed,
they warm their hearts in the embers of bridges burnt...

Fathers turn against their sons
and make mothers mourn for the loss
There's will enough to tear that wall apart!

Mouths dry with the dust of havoc
and thirsty for blood to force it down
That's enough to tear a nation apart
and add another brick to the wall...

...and with lips sealed and closed,
they warm their hearts in the embers of bridges burnt...

Fathers turn against their sons
and make mothers mourn for the loss
There's will enough to tear that wall apart!
