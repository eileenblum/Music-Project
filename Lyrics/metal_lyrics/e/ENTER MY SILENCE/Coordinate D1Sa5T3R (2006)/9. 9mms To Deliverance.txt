The absence of you, the absence of punishing words
pulls me closer and closer to my brand new addiction
Delirious and willing, I bounce from vice to vice

Stay out of my way and let me finish the walk
It's just nine millimeters to my deliverance...

Prepared for the loss, yet struck by its devastating consequence
In search for an exit I plunge head-first into the world
of shattered glass and broken dreams, where all is vain

Stay out of my way and let me finish the walk
It's just nine millimeters to my deliverance...

Deeper, deeper in the chemical sleep
Forced to take desperate, permanent measures

Face down and lifeless, I took rapture in whole
I got what I had coming and you got your revenge
The rose still blooms and I wither, vanishing to the ground

Stay out of my way and let me finish the walk
It's just nine millimeters to my deliverance...
