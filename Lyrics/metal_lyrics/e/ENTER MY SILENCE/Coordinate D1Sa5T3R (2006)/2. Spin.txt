Miles away, with hours to sunrise
rest those sorry souls in serene sleep
Those unaware of minds discomfort,
those who will in turn become the ones who weep

Day after day, a merciless sun defines our being
and outshines the weaker moon
It undermines the seconds we hold priceless,
the hours that pass too soon

Revolving, there's no way to slow it down
No matter where you are, the burden is yours to bear

Sleep now and forever rid your woes
There's no point in waking up when every day brings pain

Revolving, there's no way to slow it down
No matter where you are, the burden is yours to bear
