He took it, the final step towards a troublesome continual
Intended or not, it was a step to remember and regret
And one that didn't leave a pring to follow back

He aimed for the black and fell...
A murderous move to meet their growing demand,
to coordinates given as disaster

His heart pounds chaos and some shameful join,
deception completes the front
Even if chose for safe progress and word,
this beast lies in all tongues

He aimed for the black and fell...
A murderous move to meet their growing demand,
to coordinates given as disaster

The day is due when it sweeps across the continents
a tempest that no soothing words can tame
It calls for a cut-throat resolution!

There's nothing that a round of lead can't fix...

Black wells pour out into deep, red rivers
Is it the way the bullets dance
or just the sight of woe that gets him off?

The final step towards a troublesome continual
Intended or not, it was a step to remember and regret
And one that didn't leave a print to follow back

He aimed for the black and fell
A murderous move to meet their growing need
to coordinates gives as disaster.
