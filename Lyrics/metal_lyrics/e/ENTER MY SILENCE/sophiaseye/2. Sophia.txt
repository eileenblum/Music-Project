Universum is so narrow - one slip and an everfall

The balance of an everpresent scale of curiosity
ponders your strenght to carry the vessel of sanity
The vessel full of secret truths - the seeds of the world
All the answers of the unknown written in human words

Make only a glance if you look to sophia's eye
By all the chances you'll timelessly fly behind the sun of mind

Aim for greater dimensions of human mind,
a prototype of newborn hate, regain the same old form!
A form of beast, a form of man - a flawless being
Strip away all senses... kill!
