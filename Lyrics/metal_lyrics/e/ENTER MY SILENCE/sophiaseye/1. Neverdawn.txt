Is it me, a memory of deepest love?
Distant voices prayed for me...
After the suffering I can't believe I am alive
I faded love for you...

I roam into the nightsky - Neverdawn
Like the light our love now gone
I fantasize - I see a dead sun
no more shining for our love - Neverdawn

Step into this dark dominion - the gray sky
Like lovers sun and moon collide
Still no dawn reveals - it's time is far away
I faded love for you...

I roam into the nightsky - Neverdawn
Like the light our love now gone
I fantasize - I see a dead sun
no more shining for our love - Neverdawn
