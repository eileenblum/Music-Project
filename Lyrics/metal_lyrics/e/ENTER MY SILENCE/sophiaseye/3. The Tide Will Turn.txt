Descendant of godlike being, cast away these chains,
release the choking grip of faith...
Two thousand years of boundaries and control,
two milleniums of deceit...

The tide will turn, and man will rise
again from the ashes of his world

The seed of god planted in our own...
Betrayed by blindfold on their souls
Conceal the lies in corridors of false beliefs
The empty vows, the hollow promises,
buried in false concept of god...

The tide will turn, and man will rise
again from the ashes of his world

"Chaos found a way to penetrate these minds,
the entity once so strong in now ours to memorize
Shattered in pieces, in cold and useless debris:
memories of long and bitter wars we fought against god
and godlike standards... and the war begins...
The final battle where man defeats god..."

The tide will turn, and man will rise
again from the ashes of his world
