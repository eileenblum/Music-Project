Chaos consolates your miseries
A dissonant melody of self-given acceptance - god-complex
Wrap yourself in empathies
Hollowed heartbeats gasping for substitutes of life.

And oceans will flow back to rivers, the sun will set on east
The nightcalm is turning into Breeze of chaos - storm of closure
The dawn of plastic night... Inhumanity's absolution
The dawn of plastic night...

Plastic dreams at the edge of awakeness...
Completely lead mind, water without reflection
The means justify the end...

Breeze of chaos - storm of closure
The dawn of plastic night... Inhumanity's absolution
The constant drama of this comletely lead mind...
