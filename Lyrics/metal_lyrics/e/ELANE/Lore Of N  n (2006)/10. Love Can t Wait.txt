Life is a one way path
to our breath and our deeds
there is no coming back
if you follow these dreams

I have no secret way
of getting all through this
but remember,
dont throw away a kiss

Love cant wait for me
and burning deep
cant wait for me

You cant always
get what you want
but the things turn right
when youre true to your heart

Love cant wait for me and burning deep
cant wait for me below your feet
stars shine through the trees
below your feet
