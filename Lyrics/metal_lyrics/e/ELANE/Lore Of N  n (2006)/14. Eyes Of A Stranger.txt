Through the eyes of a dreamer
she can watch herself
being one with mankind
-but she never had been

Through the eyes of a fool
she can watch herself
spending time with dreaming
-cause theres no time within

With the eyes of a mantis
she is coming close
with a kiss to remember
-to give the overdose

"Come and take my place
see how you look in blue
step into the maze
of jigsaw and clue"

"The mirror of eyes is leading your way
theres silence and sighs in the end
in the end
two strangers will stay"

Through the eyes of a lover
she can watch herself
summer raindrops just falling
-to touch her naked skin

Through the eyes of a stranger
she can watch herself
most skin as reptile
-living for the sin

With the eyes of a mantis
she is coming close
with a kiss to remember
-to give the overdose

Witness the play of the circles of rain
dropping from leaves into rivers and lakes
silvery water is here to be pure
heaven is open to send me a cure

Strangers are coming and strangers will go
give you the gift of new wings to unfold
distance is shrinking between you and me
when we connect our minds to be free

Open your eyes
-open your arms

open your eyes
-open your arms

Open your eyes
-open your arms

Open your eyes
-open your arms
