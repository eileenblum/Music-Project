And one day
we'll find the star
and both of us
will fly away

You look at me
dont speak a word
your eyes so pure
offer a light

The light of all truth
a perfect flame
I kiss the air
that surrounds you

And all I know
that you are there
my brightest star
the star I love

Soon will fall
all golden tears
we feel the truth
the warmest light

Come to me my star
come to me my star

Come to me my star
come to me my star
