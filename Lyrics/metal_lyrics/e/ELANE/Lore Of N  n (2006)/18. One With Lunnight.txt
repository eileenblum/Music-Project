So alone far away
they met once in the gale
blind for rain for the way and the aim

And the wind surrounding them
not a word passed their lips
in the gale in that Glenvores night

Oh your eyes shine so bright
like the stars above your head
never seen them smiling so bright
come with me to my land
where the tales will never die
come with me oh my sad looking man

And they moved through the woods
where the ancient stones will be
on the path to the precious green

And they passed Armaghs trees
thousand hills to be free
in the gale under the starry sky

[x2:]
Oh your eyes shine so bright?
like the stars above your head
never seen them smiling so bright
come with me to my land
where the tales will never die
come with me oh my sad looking man

She once glanced
took her cape
and their eyes shone so bright
their eyes became one
with lunnight
