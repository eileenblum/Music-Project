There is a child in you
that wants to run and hide
watching the sky with you
best thing I can do tonight?
I know stories
that you've never heard before

And as autumn leaves a trace
colourful light upon your face
beautiful blue in dancing leaves
won't you please heal my disease?

And it feels like you're a ghost
nobody sees and no-one knows
in your eyes a golden maze
when warm and cold embrace

Now its half past you flashback of sense
its slipping away and so far out of reach
