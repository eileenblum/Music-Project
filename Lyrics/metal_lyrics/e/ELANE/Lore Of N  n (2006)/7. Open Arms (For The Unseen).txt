Heaven, heaven cant you hear?
I am screaming to the atmosphere

No more corners there to hide
will you let me come inside?

Open gates open arms
keep me silent, cool and safe from harm

Youre the one make it true
I am coming to an end
let me follow into blue
on demand

Find me pure find me new
things will never be the same
open arms for the unseen
the unseen

They often asked me I in the past
have you ever tried to count the stars?

Wooden heart takes the heat
to feed the emptiness inside of me

Father, father cant you see?
I found divine and pure simplicity

Youre the one make it true
I am coming to an end
let me follow into blue
on demand

Find me pure find me new
things will never be the same
open arms for the unseen
the unseen

Take your time lifes too fast
to find salvation on this endless path

Its far too late for open ends
embrace the unseen with your naked hands

Youre the one make it true
I am coming to an end
let me follow into blue
on demand

Find me pure find me new
things will never be the same
open arms for the unseen
the unseen

follow into blue
follow into blue
follow into blue
follow into blue
