You think it's time again
and now you're here again
just to follow a new way
You know behind the hills
begins another wish
Always dreamt of that place

I think of an angel
and somehow it seems too dark

That's when
the night has come
to break it all
to pass the dawn
the night has come
to change it all
all winds should come

And it's so quiet now
we can see the stars
no winds no voices here
it's time to search our home

That's when ...
