Come to me, dont fear, love
for I'll never leave you

Go to sleep, dont fear the cold
cause it wont last for long
and Ill be at your side

Winds might blow and shadows play
cold winters song for us

But springtimes golden lace will come
sun again will fill our hearts
what we thought we lost comes home
rain wash away our fears and grief tonight
