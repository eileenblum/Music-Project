Through night's grey veil he rode
accompanied by moon
and stars, he found the path
the secret tale was true

On and on,
have faith, be strong
and find the place
from ancient tales

The ancient pathway led to
myriads of tiny sparks
in hollow boles they lived
to tell from trav'llers' hearts

On and on, you'd faith, were strong
and found the place
from ancient tales
on and on, have faith, be strong
to leave this place from ancient tales
