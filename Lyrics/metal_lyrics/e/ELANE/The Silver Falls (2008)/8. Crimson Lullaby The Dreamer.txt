We may fall asleep, may fall asleep
May fall so deep, may fall asleep

You can say what you want â But you know that I donât trust you anymore
You can say what you want â But you know that I donât love you anymore
Say my name, say my name â But you know that I donât listen you anymore
Fall asleep, fall asleep â But you know that I wonât dream of you no more

Crimson Lullaby
