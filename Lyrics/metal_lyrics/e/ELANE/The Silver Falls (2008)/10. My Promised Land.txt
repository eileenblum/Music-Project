Fate takes me away
From where we once dreamed
This wonderful kingdom
Of beauty and light

All these lonely days
To catch your embrace
My dreams seem so painful
Since you left my side

Where is the path, the path to you
What is the world to let me through
Where is the path, the path to you
Into the life, that Iâm missing so

Guarded by stars
Kept of your song
Your voice full of magic
It whispers to me

Will walk through the lands
No one understands
My star fades away
But Iâll never rest

Where is the path, the path to you
What is the world to let me through
Where is the path, the path to you
Into the life, that Iâm missing so

Oh my promised land â drive my pain away
Oh my sanctuary â lead me out of the astray
Oh my promised land â remembrance is a truth
And itâs forever â forever kept in you
