Break adrift, break adrift
Follow me into the crowd
Take my hand, take my kiss
And enjoy this bliss

Come undone, dome inside
Into tonightâs embrace
And the world and its grace
Is our oyster tonight

Just for the blink of an eye
You are mine
Just for some temporary bliss
Take this kiss

Youâre the light of the sacred
Give me your warmth
Iâm the eye of the cyclone
Dance with a storm

Into the arms of enchantment
Till a new break of dawn
A new break of dawn
