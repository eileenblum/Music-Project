Moments so calm
Seen in the past
In our embrace
Youâve always promised me

To stand by me
Forevermore
To hold me here
To new dayâs dawn

Follow me
Through amber fields

All alone
A secret song
Follow me
Through amber fields

See me smile
Through silent tears
You can be sure
Iâll always be near
