I know itâs over now
And I have cried too many times
I must get over this
Bury my hope one last time

But then the wind reminds me of you
And the rain reminds me, too
When it snows I think of you
And the spring reminds me of you
And every day I think of you
Will you ever love me, too
Will you

Another day
And life goes on
I havenât seen you for about two years
And soon thereâs not much left to feel
You coldly closed that door too many times

Sometimes itâs like I see you here
Itâs just my mind playing tricks on me
âcause I will never see you again
I will move on
Wonât look back

But then the wind reminds me of you
And the rain reminds me, too
When it snows I think of you
And the spring reminds me of you
And every day I think of you
Will you ever love me, too
Will you
