Little paper boat
Against the force of tides
Dragged to open sea
Subtel wind comes up

As shimmring as a shell
As shimmring is your heart
As hollow as a shell
As hollow is your heart

And I really wanna be in your arms tonight
Feels like Iâm dragged by the force of a satellite
So Iâm sitting here looking at the waterside
While Iâm flying on emotions like a silver kite

Paper boatâs fighting against the force of tides
Like itâs dragged by the force of a satellite
I am sitting here looking at the ocean wide
And feel like flying on emotions like a silver kite

Take all my hopes with you
Take all my dreams with you
Take all my love with you
Take my whole life with you

A thousand miles away
When silence breaks the wind
And everything is calm
Sheâs opening her arms

A little paper boat
Was washed ashore, some say
Out of sight for long
Existing anyway

And I really wanna be in your arms tonight
Feels like Iâm dragged by the force of a satellite
So Iâm sitting here looking at the waterside
While Iâm flying on emotions like a silver kite

Paper boatâs fighting against the force of tides
Like itâs dragged by the force of a satellite
I am sitting here looking at the ocean wide
And feel like flying on emotions like a silver kite
