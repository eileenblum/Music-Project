Here I hold the Silverleaf
You once gave me near the moon
A star is closed into this leaf
Is this love meant for me - meant for us?

Take my kiss, my painful love
My sad heart, itâs all I have
To Dagaz, tears of the moon will
Dance with us

How weak the luck in my hands
I am drawing you with silvery light
Which love is meant for me
To come with me to the endless sea

Take my kiss, my painful love
My sad heart, itâs all I have
To Dagaz, tears of the moon will
Dance with us
