Lost in lonesome woods
Was exiled to my darkest fear
No dusk, no dawn find their way to me
To lead me out of this

Misdeed was done when I came in
Iâve never seen such dreadful sin
A well-known shadow covered me
For I was cursed so wrongfully

Now I can see the land through your eyes
Can feel the wind carry me up high
Through the clouds and endless skies
Till I reach my homeland I will fly

Misdeed was done when I came in
Iâve never seen such dreadful sin
A well-known shadow covered me
For I was cursed so wrongfully

Now I can see the land through your eyes
Can feel the wind carry me up high
Through the clouds and endless skies
Till I reach my homeland I will fly

I ravenâs coat I shall prevail
From breeze to wind
From storm to gale

Now I can see the land through your eyes
Can feel the wind carry me up high
Through the clouds and endless skies
Till I reach my homeland I will fly
