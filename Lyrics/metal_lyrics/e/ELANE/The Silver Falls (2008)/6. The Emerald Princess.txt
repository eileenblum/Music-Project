Tell me the story of the emerald Princess
Who lived in this forest many centuries ago
The sheen of two gems filled with ivory moonlight
Her hair was meadow when kissed by the wind

Shadows play in every light
A secret kept in darkest night
See what we saw with our eyes
When she awoke without disguise

Tell me the story of the emerald Princess
Who lived in this forest many centuries ago
Her beautyâs been kept all throughout ages
The spell of forever, the roots of her sight

To lift the veil the spellâs been torn
The secretâs known and sheâs forlorn
And Princess Weeping Willowâs hand
Had written down the sagaâs end
