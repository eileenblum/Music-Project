Night emerald trees
Unfold their leaves
Adorning to the glade of Armagh

Open the Gates
The Elves will come in
To enlight the dark
To defend their land

From far beyond
Through the darkest glen
The knights will come
On a blazing path

Fight with fire warmth
Be one with the night
Remember my gift
When doubt brings down your heart

Open the Gates
The Elves will come in
To enlight the dark
To defend their land

And dance through the night
Until the morning comes
Together we stand
To defend our land
