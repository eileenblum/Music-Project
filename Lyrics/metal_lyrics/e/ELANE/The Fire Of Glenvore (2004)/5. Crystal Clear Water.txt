She woke up my dear
Her dreams were too thin
To keep her within
A realm beyond her fears
Let's stay here for more
There is no eternal spring
To walk along and sing
Are we lost like before?

She never felt related
To tenderness before
Until he gave these feelings
That cut down to the core
She never felt related
To heaven once before
Her feet were in the water
as she was sitting by the shore

Crystal clear water
On pale and velvet skin
Laid down in morning colours
No breeze of any sin
Dancing water lillies
Upon the silent lake
Hidden in the woods
and veiled by mighty shades
