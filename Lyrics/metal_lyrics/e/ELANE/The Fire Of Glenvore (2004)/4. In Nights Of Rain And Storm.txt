Alone at the ancient trees
Tried to forget the past
That never belonged to them
Tears that have been wasted

When will you understand
My man â the world for me
Why didnât we find our way
Why did all have to be

In nights of rain so cold
Weâre sitting near the fire
Here I swear and give you my word
That forever Iâll be your maid

My man, do you understand...
Be with you in rain and storm
Forever Iâll stay with you
Bring you sunlight in the rain

In nights of rain and storm
Stay with me by the fire
And swear and give me your word
That forever youâll be my manâ¦
