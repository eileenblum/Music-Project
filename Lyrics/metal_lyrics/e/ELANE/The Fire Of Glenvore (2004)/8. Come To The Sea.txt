I hear the waves
Far beyond the dunes
My grey and hazy surf
They sound like merry tunes
They've been leading me
Here for many years
So please don't speak a word
For the sea has many ears

My dear, come to the sea
Let's watch the sun descend
Just for a while, pretend
That all we are is here
My love, come to the sea
To where we always went
When we had to pretend
Like shining stars we'll be

A cool and salty breeze
To moisturize your lips
So come and have a seat
And let me take a sip
Let's taste the gloomy air
so cool and fresh and dark
Then touch my floating hair
And kiss me, take my heart
