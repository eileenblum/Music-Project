I wish I was on yonder hill
'Tis there I'd sit and cry my fill
And every tear would turn a mill
Is go dtÃ­ tÃº mo mhuirnÃ­n slÃ¡n

[Chorus:]
SiÃºil, siÃºil, siÃºil a rÃºin
SiÃºil go socair agus siÃºil go ciÃºin
SiÃºil go doras agus ealaigh liom
Is go dtÃ©ann tÃº mo mhuirnÃ­n slÃ¡n

I'll sell my rock, I'll sell my reel
I'll sell my only spinning wheel
To buy my love a sword of steel
Is go dtÃ©ann tÃº mo mhuirnÃ­n slÃ¡n

I'll dye my petticoats, I'll dye them red
And round the port I'll beg my bread
Until my parents shall wish me dead
Is go dtÃ­ tÃº mo mhuirnÃ­n slÃ¡n

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
I wish I had my heart again
And vainly think I'd not complain
Is go dtÃ©ann tÃº mo mhuirnÃ­n slÃ¡n

And now my love has gone to France
To try his fortune to advance
If he e'er comes back 'tis but a chance
Is go dtÃ©ann tÃº mo mhuirnÃ­n slÃ¡n

[translation of the Irish chorus:]
Go, go, go my love
Go quietly and peacefully
Go to the door and flee with me
And may you go safely my dear.
