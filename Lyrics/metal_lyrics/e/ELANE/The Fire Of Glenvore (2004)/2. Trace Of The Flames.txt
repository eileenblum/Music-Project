sky is so endless and red
we dance the dark ones, we dance the dark ones away
leave all those things behind
we move in thyme fog
dive in the firewind

[CHORUS]
the trace of the flames
the light of the torches
that will never end
so try to reach heaven
the trace of the flames
the light of the torches
that will never end
so try to reach heaven... I know...

all fairies dance with us
we let us fall, we let us fall in the wind.
and when I cry for you
will you stay here,
will you stay here when I ask?
