My dear, how could you ever leave me in this mess?
I dream of you so often, it seem to turn away

We walk together, no matter the distance
We'll fight forever through the heavy rain

So please stay with me, I need your warth so much
I run to you, for just what hold my hands in yours

My dear love if I called you, would you understand?
But I'd want you to laugh with me, in Roseslake again

Be here forever, no matter why you cry
We'll fight together through the stormy sky

So please stay with me, I need your warth so much
I run to you, for just what hold my hands in yours, in yours, in yours
