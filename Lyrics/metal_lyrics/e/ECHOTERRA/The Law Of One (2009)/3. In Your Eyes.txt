Verse I
I felt so complete, so alive, always at ease
You by my side, never to leave
I always knew you'd be taken from me

Days go by and I'm left with the sadness
Time chasing time leads to my madness
Another place, a different window
A new path for me to go through

Pre Chorus
Why did you leave me this way?
When all I ever wanted was just one more day

Chorus
In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure
In Your Eyes I see my life

Take me on your final journey
Take me back into your arms

Chorus
In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure
In Your Eyes I see my life
Far beyond the light I feel your inner torment
Far beyond the night I hear your cries

Can you hear me when I call you?
Are you afraid of what surrounds you?
From beyond the dark I'll find you
No matter what hell I go through

Chorus

Outro
Take me on your final journey
Take me back into your arms
In Your Eyes I see the glory
In Your Eyes I see my life
