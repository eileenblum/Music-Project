Nights I spend awake
Waiting for the sign
Days never ended
When will the time arrive?
Far beyond my sight
Hiding in the dark
A semblance of a feeling that was lost
But now is found

As I take a look around me
Never did I feel so lonely
In the dream
The voice had told me
Now it's time
For A Different Story

Ever will I know
What lies inside my mind?
Searching through my pride
I find no place to hide
Blindly still I go
And leave the past behind
Faithfully embrace the light

As I take a look around me
Never did I feel so lonely
In the dream
The voice had told me
Now it's time
For A Different Story

Light surrounds the dark
As it pulls me in
I take a look behind
And see the golden door
It draws closer now
As the touch begins
I step into beyond
And flee forever more
