First we must prove we can work.
That we are deserving of the penance and the sacred dirt.
Because our constitution is buried int he soil,
While our ambition seeks to ascertain and toil in the high.

Do you really know what's real anymore?

Then we must move.
Invite ourselves as conduits
To congregate in lieu
Of all the disparity we hold in our hearts
And the unanswered questions that tear us apart.

I could show you everything I know,
But I was told that honest art is dead.
You could give me a bed when I've got nowhere to go,
But you were told that good nature is all in your head.

When will we lead ourselves to water
And drink ourselves clean in the well?
When will we see our sins as fodder,
Transcend the judgement and bid farewell?

When we are one,
We will discern a meaning.
When we are one,
We are consecrated.
