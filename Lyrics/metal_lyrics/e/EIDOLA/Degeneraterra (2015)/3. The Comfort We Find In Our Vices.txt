I went wandering around the devil's sea
Searching for the skeleton key

(I tried to drown my demons)
(But I taught them how to swim)
To unlock my patience
(I keep giving in)
(Cutting holes in my boat)
And understand my self-control
(They dance on the sails)
(And set fire to my hope)

To tame the lion that is will is a burden and a blessing
Most just let desire run its coarse
But I will not sit idly by
And let him devour my roots

All of my doubt
Does nothing but monopolize
I tell myself
"Let it go. Let it go."
When you realize
Your addictions keep you polarized
You will learn to let it go
Let it go

We detach and isolate
When we're just fractions of a whole
But in the ways we are connect
Lie the signal and the soul

I will not sit idly by and sell my confidence for timid ways

All of my doubt
Does nothing but monopolize
I tell myself
"Let it go. Let it go."
When you realize
Your addictions keep you polarized
You will learn to let it go
Let it go

I'll cut you out

Never to haunt me again
