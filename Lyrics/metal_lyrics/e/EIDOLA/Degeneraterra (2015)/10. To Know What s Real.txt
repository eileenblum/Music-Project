It's easy to get lost
Swimming through the currents
Of absolutes
Of "us" and "them"
Now a history of vanity
Is all that we have left

And it's time to clean up the mess

This can't be all there is
We were born for so much more than prescriptions and caving in
This can't be all there is
I've seen hope when love is fleeting
Broken men rebuilt in the image of what we will grow to be

As evolution marches on
The helix frays
A future birthed for all of man
But would you say the same?

Or hold rationale to circumvent blame?

This can't be all there is
We were born for so much more than prescriptions and caving in
This can't be all there is
I've seen hope when love is fleeting
Broken men rebuilt in the image of what we will grow to be

We hold our bones to the light
And pray that our fractures have earned us the right
To be saved
But in the gravity of our situation
We have learned
Man is simply undeserving, and impossible to mold

If at any point you find this burden too heavy to bear
And in turn feel yourself sinking in the almighty sea of despair
Then I promise you this. . .

"I will jump ship the first chance I get. . .

I will comfort you. . .

We can save each other"
