I've been treading water,
Tracing fire across the sky.
Killing all the daylight
In your un-dreaming eyes.

Would you hear a melody
If it didn't rhyme?
Could you feel a rhythm
Seal your place in time?

For centuries we've squandered
Everything that's sacred.
These centuries we've stuttered
To replicate the frequency.

I was born to remain,
You were born to resist.
All the lies you maintain,
All the ques that I missed.

We were the invulnerable everything with nothing left to feel.
As you and I divide, we'll compromise and learn to know what's real.

Your wanderlust
Never carried us,
Nor satisfied the need to be saved.
Your highness
Never pardoned us,
Now we wait in squalor as saints.

I am the tyrant,
You are the defeated.
I am the ocean
You are the depleted.
I am the beggar,
You are the wealthy.
I am the proud,
You are the one who made me.

Don't let go.
My arms are full and my burden heavy.
I need to know
That all of this is more than temporary.

We'll never know what's real.
