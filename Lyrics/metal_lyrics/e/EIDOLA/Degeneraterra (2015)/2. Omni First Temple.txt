My intention
Is to explore the realm of consciousness
And the human condition.
To make mention
Of my gratitude and procession
I speak without apprehension.

This constancy in unity
Is all that I know and all that I see.
Existence will consume us all
And what we will grow to be.

What confines you?
Who holds the strings?
And how does it define your purpose?
I want to know

I want to know your perception.

Give us everything you have.
Give us the truth,

And we'll give you consistency.
A place to reside in this complex design,
Where grandeur is fated and fear can resign.

Carve your path
(Manifest destiny)
Stake a claim
(Rewrite your history)
Do the math
(As flawless as entropy)
Make a name
(Disregard vanity)

Oh, brother,
Can you hear me speaking?
Oh, brother,
Can't you see you're still sleeping?

I'll be your redeemer from this world you created.

Will we know God?
