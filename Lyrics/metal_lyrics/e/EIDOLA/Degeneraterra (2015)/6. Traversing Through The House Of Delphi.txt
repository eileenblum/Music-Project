Oh what it is to be
Selfless, formless and incomplete.
Limitless proliferation
Without the complications.

If you don't know where to go from here,
Then I suggest you listen well
And speak loud and clear.

Disassociate yourself from what you know.
Seek the truth and we will overflow.

I'm just a man in a world of God.
I bargain for my freedom,
But lately I've been coming up short,
So I wager for my innocence and try to cut the cord.

Oh how I try to cut the cord.

There's no going back,
We've sealed our fate here in this realm,
But I know that you can find a way out of this hell.
And I'll be waiting near the light for you.

I waited my whole life for that sacred moment, now I'm ready to cave in.

Transcend the end.
