On the day you sold your faith for a chance to be heard,
You spoke so softly that no one could make out your word.
With all those thoughts on salvation you've yet to convey,
And the constant maintenance of yourself on display,

Are you okay?

I feel the weight of the world
Reshape, reform and progress.
I hear the dissonance of ignorance
Relive, retain and convalesce.

Am I cursed to walk the earth empty handed and afraid
Of every tangible outcome or every possible mistake?
My eyes burn brighter with each passing gaze, and I know
That in the end I have numbered their days.

So it goes.

Oh, contra,
We give you everything
To mean nothing at all.

You're just a stranger.
