[feat. Jorge Sotomayor &amp; Tyler Andre of Adaliah]I don't fear death, you shouldn't fear death
Pressure, it's all i feel flowing through my veins you can never tell how i feel everyday over and over again, over and over again
Never ever would i think you would be the one to take it all away
Lie after lie, you kept spewing over and over again
All i give, is never enough

Every time i see your face, i remember what a waste
The many times you lied to me, now you understand why its hard for me, give it your all take what is yours finally free, this is who i am meant to be.
Hey hey hey, what can i say some things never change
Hey hey hey, what can i say some things never change 
And for the better for the better, i guess its my time to go
So tired, so tired i guess its my time to go

This is what i really think, gone in a fucking blink you were
Cruel to me, cruel to me so very cruel to me, you were the only thing i ever had, why don't you understand the pain i always felt it goes hand and hand
you were the only thing i ever had, why don't you understand the pain i always felt it goes hand and hand

Look into my eyes, and tell me i am not alive
Every word you ever said was just another lie, look into my eyes
All i ever see is death and deceit when your around me
Its just a feeling i never knew, something so fake like you
I know this cant be true, it's like me without you.
A feeling i never knew.
