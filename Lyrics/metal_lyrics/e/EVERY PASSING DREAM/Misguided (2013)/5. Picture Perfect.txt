You never realize how much it hurts, and how much i wanted this to work.
You wasted time, you wasted mine, searching for something iv been trying to find.

Sitting back watching this unfold, this is for the soul you sold
Countless nights wishing, waiting for a god damn sign.
All i ever wanted was to call you mine, mine in the softest sense
We met at the wrong time.
All i ever wanted was to call you mine, mine in the softest sense
We met at the wrong time, meditate think about this.
Is this what you want, let me know before i go

Fuck love and the pain it brings to me, i wont let this feeling fucking surround me, i told you once i wont tell you twice.
You made this choice now pay the price
From the start i knew this would be hard, i never thought we would come this far, maybe not maybe we were destined for failure 

From the start i knew this would be hard, i never thought we would come this far, maybe not maybe we were destined for failure 
I gave you time that you said you needed, i never thought you'd be the one quickly retreating, is this what you want, i cant count the times where is it wasn't enough.

Is this what you want, i cant count the times where it wasn't enough.
All i ever wanted was to call you mine, mine in the softest sense
We met at the wrong time.
All i ever wanted was to call you mine, mine in the softest sense
We met at the wrong time, meditate think about this.
Is this what you want, let me know before i go
