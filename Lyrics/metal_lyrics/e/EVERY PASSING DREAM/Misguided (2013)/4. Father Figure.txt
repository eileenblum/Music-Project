[feat. Gus Farias of Volumes]There is no place called home
There is no place called home
There is no place called home
There is no place called home
I never thought it would be this easy to turn my back on the ones i loved
Just like my family who held me up, and all the times you promised me things would never change
I am not broken, I am not broken
Why
I never thought it would come to this, the choices i am haunted with, i never
Did you think that i would stay, why
I never thought it would come to this, the choices i am haunted with, i never
Did you think that i would stay
I will always regret
Making the choices that let you down in the end
I will always regret
Breaking the ties of a father and his son
Theres never time for a second chance, you never know when your life will end
You are in control, and im all alone
Why must i live like this, Why must i live like this
Why
I never thought it would come to this, the choices i am haunted with, i never
Did you think that i would stay, why
I never thought it would come to this, the choices i am haunted with, i never
Did you think that i would stay
As you see me crawling back, i will watch you walk away
As you see me crawling back, i will watch you walk away
