Everything you said to me, i have heard it before
Let me tell you, one more time, this is where i draw the line
Where do you stand, where do you stand?
Between the lines, between the lines.

Let me tell you, one more time, this is where i draw the line
All these strange faces, looking back at me, looking back at me
Hollow eyes and hungry hearts, all i hear from them
Is fear me, you are not alone, so fear me, you are not alone

Your hopes, my dreams.
Nothing will come in between
How does it feel to be alone, deep down inside you'll know
The pain i always felt, when i'm away from you, away from you

Don't speak my name, you wont be heard
Don't speak my name, you wont be heard
As the sun sets, you wont see me
As the sun sets, you wont see me

If everything goes to plan, you'll find the truth in the end
Nothing is what it seems so go ahead and take this from me
Because of you iv found, the meaning to life.
And after all these years, i wont let you hold me back

I, i cant i cant any longer, i am free, i am free, i cant any longer, free.
Dread, that all life comes to an end, your lies are so inviting, so inviting.
