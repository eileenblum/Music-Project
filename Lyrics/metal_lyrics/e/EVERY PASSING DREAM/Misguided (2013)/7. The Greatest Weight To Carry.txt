No, they wont see me in the light, for i am death.
I have come to collect every soul, for everyone standing alone
In the end i am your only friend, i can hear the fear in your voice
There is no escape this is a trap, can you feel the cracks in your weathered skin, and if you pray no one will hear and all you can do is scream!

How can you live with yourself, with your self
You will pay for this
How can you live with yourself, with your self
You will pay for this

Senseless, they murder senseless i hear the screams
Fear me, for i am here i hear their pleas
Senseless, they murder senseless i hear the screams
Fear me, for i am here i hear their pleas

Like they'll never be answered, but i can promise i am listening
I will watch the blood, watch the blood drip down your face
This is end for you my friend, you wont have a second chance
And if you pray no one will hear, and all you can do is scream

Now watch and wait as your body dissipates you lived in fear for far to long
Welcome to hell, you will pay for all of your sins how does it feel to be all alone
A broken man with broken bones, a sight to see for many like me

What did you say to me, the words i cannot say the futures unforeseen
