[feat. Daniel Mcwhorter of Gideon]Searching for the reason, the reason why you left us here to die
And for what? Your precious lies, the ones you kept deep down inside
The ones you hid from your family, you betrayed us
Everything you said to me was a lie, I never thought id hear you say goodbye.
After all the times we shared, did you think id be waiting.
Did you think that maybe you were wrong, but in the end I was already gone
After all the pain I ask what remains, the tired and the true
The ones that you betrayed, everything seems clear but I cannot see
How could you ever think of leaving me.
That I'm never coming back, face the facts, that I'm never coming back
I didn't think id be the one to blame
Go ahead and call the shots, cause like it or not we're falling apart
You shattered my dreams, and the hopes of a loving family.
There is no turning back, at least for me
After all the pain I ask what remains, the tired and the true
The ones that you betrayed, everything seems clear but I cannot see
How could you ever think of leaving me.
That I'm never coming back, face the facts, that I'm never coming back
Betrayed by my own blood, how could you do this to me
You were all I ever had, now I'm left here with nothing
With nothing, did you take the time to realize what you meant to me?
What you meant to me?
