I am lost help me find my way, help me find my way
Thats all that i ask, theres nothing more nothing more
Let me out, when i say that i am wasting away

Parasites, what more could they ask
I must be dreaming to think that this is end
I think about the words that you said
Forever trapped deep inside my head
How could you know, they never knew
Fuck you

We all lost our minds, and our broken souls
I am lost help me find my way, help me find my way
Thats all that i ask, theres nothing more nothing more

Think back on all the things, the things you said to me
The lies the truth your world, the voices spoke to me
And i ask one more time, is this it is this it
Misguided

Waiting for!

The light to guide us home, to drag us from the unknown
I wont give, i wont give up
Till i find my place, find my place
