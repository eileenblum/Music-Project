I'd rather find myself on the ground
Than up above where I can never be found

I know this life is not made for some

Bury me with my own mistakes, I don't care how long it takes
Just make sure I'm dead and gone
Dead and gone

SIX FEET DEEP IN THE GROUND

WHERE I CAN NOT BE FOUND

This family curse is one I know too well
Deep inside me, pain transforms in to guilt
Remove my eyes, this comes as no surprise

I can finally sleep, resentment I solely keep

Mother, why did you bury me? The dirt upon my face, so much I couldn't see.

WHY? I guess it's safe to say, that your son won't live to see another day.

FATHER, Why did you smother me? Your hands around my neck, so tight I couldn't breath.

WHY.Â 

I guess it's safe to say, that your son won't live to see another day.

I was buried beneath everything, mountains of guilt.Â 
Was it so hard to admit the broken homes that you built?

Bottle after bottle, your heart's racing.Â 
Did I make a right choice?Â 

LET GO.

Of everything holding you in your place, did you like the feeling of blood on your face?

SIX FEET DEEP IN THE GROUND.

WHERE I CAN NOT BE FOUND.

This family curse, is one I know too well.
Deep inside me, pain transforms in to guilt.

Remove my eyes, this comes as no surprise.Â 
I can finally sleep, resentment I solely keep.

Fighting over things that never really even mattered.Â 
Healing from every bone that you fucking shattered.
[x2]

I don't think we deserve this pain.

FATHER-MOTHER destroyed, and we are the ones to blame.Â 

I don't think we deserve this pain.

We gave up on our son, and we are the ones to blame.

This is no claim to fame, our losing fucking game.

YOU WILL ROT IN YOUR OWN GRAVE.
