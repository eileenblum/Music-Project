This is you when my world came down
You closed your eyes and raised your fists
Despite my common belief
Your nothing more then
A fucking mistake

Did you think
Proving me wrong
Your no better then your fucking lies
Set me free
From your life
Without a doubt I'll rise to shine
In time I'll learn
You were just another broken promise

Cant you see
How pathetic you are

As I beg for all I saved
No time left no second chances

You chose this path
The path you chose

I will never make the same mistake by letting you

This is your life
Time to change it
Change your life

To change your life
Change your life
