Today is the day I'll reign supreme king of kings there is only me [x2]
You dropped your crown I picked it up
You are a narrow minded fuck

Step off the throne mother fucker you're not the one to rule [x2]

I claim the world for all to know
standing tall this isn't for show
I'll bring the peace that we need
show the world were all dying to see

I claim the world for all to know
standing tall this isnt for show
I'll bring the peace that we need
show the world were all dying to see

Past rulers haven't done what I can
I'll set your free with no demand
live your life as you choose
the globe is so black and blue

Past rulers havent done what I can
I'll set your free with no demand
live your life as you choose
the globe is so black and blue

Step off the throne mother fucker you're not the one to rule [x2]

I claim the world for all to know
standing tall this isnt for show
I'll bring the peace that we need
show the world were all dying to see

I claim the world for all to know
standing tall this isnt for show
I'll bring the peace that we need
show the world were all dying to see

I will rescue the world
time and time I'll do it again

I will rescue the world
time and time I'll do it again

The world begs for your forgiveness [x4]
