Rise up now
Stand your ground

Wake up and start
The day you will overcome
This is yours no body else's
Reign Supreme

How many times I stood up for whats right
Meaningless life [x2]

As I stand for all to see
You will never overcome
As I stand for all to see
You will never overcome
Me

Time and time again
you were nothing more then
A worthless friend
You never cared
So I'm leaving you

Behind the shade
Im leaving you
Behind the shade

How many times I stood up for whats right
Meaningless life [x2]

I have ruled for centuries
I was overcome by the will of man
Forces drawn upon me
As I stand down gracefully

Did you think this time would be
Any different
You were wrong
