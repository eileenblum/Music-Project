This barren place is dead to all
No life worth living is it hard to see
That your feeling wound up
This will be my day hate driven
Anger fed I am not afraid

How can you learn
How can you know
Realize that you set your fate
Dreading fate
Dissonence

How many times you fell for this
Stay your distance away from me
God damn your useless undo
Open up your eyes today

Choking on your words
Time to open up seize the day
You're useless to me
My eyes have seen
Seen the day

You fall short
Your broken rules
I know now
I know now
This will never end.
