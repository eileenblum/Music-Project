[Music by M. Siethoff]
[Words by B. Houter]

A devilish light
Out of the darkness
Set the heavens on flames
It will never be the same
They suddenly came
Out of the darkness
Our planet to claim

* S.P.Y. *
Secret forces in the sky
* S.P.Y. *
A devious sight to encounter the eye

A phantom of the night
Creating shadows on the wall
Spying laser eyes
In a quest for the game
The menace of crime
Obscured by darkness
Just a matter of time

* S.P.Y. *
Secret forces in the sky
* S.P.Y. *
A devious sight to encounter the eye

* S.P.Y. *
Secret forces in the sky
* S.P.Y. *
A devious sight to encounter the eye
* S.P.Y. *
Secret forces in the sky
* S.P.Y. *
A devious sight to encounter the eye
