[Music by M. Siethoff]
[Words by B. Houter]

The infinite space never stops to amaze
No limits, no boundaries at all
Assigned to a mission of finding a place
The spirit will answer the call
To wander among the stars that lighten my way
Shinning along the trial in a dazzling array

Fled from the mercy and the cloak of the flesh
The mind has started to soar
Elated to height and knowing no fright
The time has come to explore
Soaking the into and all there is to know
Roaming the cosmos
Iâm taking control

To the corners of the universe
(Iâm taking control)
Understanding a space odyssey
(A total recall)
From the matter to emerge
A new born world
Breaking (Free!)

Genius mind makes the forces combine to escape
From the Virgo in time
Into the black thereâs no turning back
Just leaving the present behind
Nobody really knows what the future may hold
Images raising the hope once foretold

The venture engages the final approach
Within reach of the last resort for millions of light-years
Enforcing the law to claim the rightful reward
Never a doubt in my mind about winning the war
Victory smiles upon those defying the storm

To the corners of the universe
(Iâm taking control)
Understanding a space odyssey
(A total recall)
From the matter to emerge
A new born world
Breaking (Free!)

[Point Of No Return Part II]

I am returning from the grave
To break the silence
In my wake and seal my fate
Let the mystic power flow
To arouse my dormant soil

A planet born!!!
