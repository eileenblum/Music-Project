[Words by B. Houter &amp; C. Timmer]

Oh! Iâm full of power now
I draw from sources beyond your wildest dreams
Stand in my way and Iâll tear you apart
Leave it all behind for Iâm the light
Revenge controls my mind

Watch out!
Mystery beyond the night
Iâm ready now to start a fight
Watch out!
Mystery inside of me

Iâm up against a tyrant force
But the evils are no match at all
Iâm in a state where space and time no longer hold
Dimensions in control for Iâm the light
The power is untold

Watch out!
Mystery beyond the night
Iâm ready now to start a fight
Watch out!
Mystery inside of me

* Message For The Commanding Captain On Duty *
* Red Alert In The Transformation Room! *
* Transmission Transformation Overruled! *
* Overruledâ¦Overruledâ¦ *

My angerâs now exceeding rage
Iâm going to destroy!
The power that I use
Just canât be avoided
Destroying my identity was really
The creation of a far superior identity
Fatal miscount!
