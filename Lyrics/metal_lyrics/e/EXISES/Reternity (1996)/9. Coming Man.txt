[Words by B. Houter]

Back on the road, feel the power
Shacking the load in the morning hour
Adrenaline flow, feel the pounding of my heart
All systems go! Iâm the coming man?

A glorious sight unfolding to the eye
Showing the might
Expectations running high
A vital sign for those who understand
Revival in time
This can be the Promised Land

My instinct pulls me back on my feet
Every fiber denying defeat
Up and awake, bright as a flame
Swearing a vow that justice will reign

Iâm the prime crusader
Iâm the pride of man
Iâm a space invader
Iâm the coming man

Urging on for the road is very long
Taking my chances, yeah
The heat is on
The rolling dice have tuned my way
An omen Iâll have to obey

A mighty blow of unprecedented force
Driving me on, showing no remorse
The trail alight burning in the eyes
A silver gateway reaching for the sky
Breaking out, shouting loud
Feeling proud

Iâm the prime crusader
Iâm the pride of man
Iâm a space invader
Iâm the coming man

To state my case I raise my sword
The echo of a soldier whoâs waging war
Oh...

Iâm the prime crusader
Iâm the pride of man
Iâm a space invader
Iâm the coming man
