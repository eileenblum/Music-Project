[Words by B. Houter, C. Timmer &amp; A. Sleyster]

Dying, oh, Iâm dying
I donât believe in miracles
Itâs over now
Something tells me to escape
Survive somehow
Try, try the outside
Time will turn into dust
The city-heart is gonna blow
Any second now
No escape, nothing left
To be trusted
Itâs out of control!

Danger!
Meltdown Sector 6!
Fall-out!
On the premises
Fire!
Meltdown Sector 6!
Danger! Danger! Danger!

Somethingâs left for the children
Poison without control
When children die, time is turning
Itâs the end
The world is burning

Danger!
Meltdown Sector 6!
Fall-out!
On the premises
Fire!
Meltdown Sector 6!
Danger! Danger! Danger!

Locked up in the city-dome
Why me? What have I done?
Help me, Iâm praying to get saved
To see the light of the morning sun

Danger!
Meltdown Sector 6!
Fall-out!
On the premises
Fire!
Meltdown Sector 6!
Danger! Danger! Danger!
