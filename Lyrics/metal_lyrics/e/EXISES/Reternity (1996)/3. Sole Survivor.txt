[Words by B. Houter &amp; A. Sleyster]

&gt; Iâm still alive! &lt;
Hear the howling of the wind
A surge of light
Beaming through the night
Fear is haunting me, Iâm tossing it
Iâm losing track of time
Eyes are echoing the pain
A void of emptiness
Conquering my mind
All this wasted land
Wasted, wasted for all time
And all that is left
A sea of tranquility
An ocean of pain

Sole survivor
Am I to rule this wasted land?
Sole survivor
Fighting my wayâ¦till the dawn

Behold the ruins of my world
A frantic rage
Fireâs burning, burning
This confounded place
A heritage of modern times
Iâve passed the point of no return
Against the odds, a sole survivor
I will find my way, a way
To live my life
But all that is left
A sea of tranquility
An ocean of pain

Sole survivor
Am I to rule this wasted land?
Sole survivor
Fighting my wayâ¦till the dawn

Am I alone?
Iâve got the feeling
Somebodyâs watching me!

And all that is left
A sea of tranquility
An ocean of pain

Sole survivor
Am I to rule this wasted land?
Sole survivor
Fighting my wayâ¦
