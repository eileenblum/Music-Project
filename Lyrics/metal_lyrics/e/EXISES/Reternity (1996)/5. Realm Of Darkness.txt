[Words by B. Houter &amp; C. Timmer]

Underneath the surface
Somewhere in my mind
Iâm fighting the memories
From the path that lies behind
The mere sensation
Every nerve to crave

This is insanity
I need to escape
I need to escape
This realm of darkness
Realm of darkness

The images passing by
Iâm sure Iâve seen all those faces
The one I loved forever lost
Her eyes keep staring at me
Her misty eyes slowly fade away
As I move me head around to see
A spot of what my future brings
Seeking triumph to humanity
Return to primal scream

This is insanity
I need to escape
I need to escape
This realm of darkness
Realm of darkness

I escape from reality
While I ponder my dream
So I close my eyes again
I feel the need to scream
Raise my eyes up to the sky
Ask the stars how to leave
This desert of confusion
A target I will achieve
Awake in confusion
To redeem the daze

This is insanity
I need to escape
I need to escape
Realm of darkness
Realm of darkness
Realm of darkness

Carried away
By the call of my name
Surrounded by walls of my need
That buried the shame
Cuts like a blade
