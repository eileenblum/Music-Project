[Music by M. Siethoff &amp; R. Schaap]
[Words by B. Houter]

The scale has shifted
Bio-chemical threat
Restore the balance
Seize the epidemic spread

In the overheated turbulence
We ran a calculated risk
Modern technology

Reset the action
* Zero Digital Readout *
Reset the scene
To the origin of the stream

Now the stone is cast
On supreme authority
To ignite the nuclear blast
The end of an odyssey

With the force of the impact
The gauges flicker and rocked
Communications breakdown

Reset the action
* Zero Digital Readout *
Reset the plan
To the genesis of man

* The Scale Has Shifted *
* Reset The Action *
The end of an odyssey
