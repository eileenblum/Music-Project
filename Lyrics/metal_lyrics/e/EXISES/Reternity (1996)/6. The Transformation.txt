[Music by M. Siethoff]
[Words by B. Houter]

Transform!

Slowly my mind has come to reason
Astound by the sight I behold
Alien forces looking for treason
Invading my mind to sold

Invisible waves come to hypnotize
Injecting the sun right to the bone
Computers on stand-by ready to digitize
Taking my soul to a place unknown

Transform!
Rescue the species
Transform!
Memory deleted

Increasing activity
Charging to maximum load
All systems go, taking control
Releasing the power to the target below
Conformation of energy-flow

Interactive sensors feeding the terminal
Human-compatible software running the score
Sampling the DNA form the original
A human being no more!

Transform!
Rescue the species
Transform!

Transform!
Oh! Rescue the species
Transform!
Oh! Memory deleted
Transform!
Oh! Mission completed
Transform!
Oh! A human being no more
