On this magical dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that has been captured for years in oblivion of time

Circles of time are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to die!

...And he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him into a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...

Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Show us your might

His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
The white storm is close!

...And his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever possessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... Once again!

Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Gift from the sky
