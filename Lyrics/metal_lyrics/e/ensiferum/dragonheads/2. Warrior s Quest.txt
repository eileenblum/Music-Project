Strike with powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home

...Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown are the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death

Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like the guiding stars

As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting

Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach into the darkest night...
