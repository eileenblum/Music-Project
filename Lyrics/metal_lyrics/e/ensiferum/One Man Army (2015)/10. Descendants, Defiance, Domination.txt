The darkest hour, the hopeless time
Is always before the rise of the dawn
Find your courage to stand against a stream
The fairest they speak when the falsest they think

When mouths of men speak the words of gods
The truth will never be enough for anyone
When you reach the peak of the highest mountain
Proudly plant the flag of the heathen defiance

From the ashes of the ancient blood and wisdom
The children of thunder will rise again

Wielded lashes, pyres aflame, gloomy gallows
Tormented ones, brave and free
Screams echo in time

Not one unjust deed goes unpunished
No blood is shed in vain under the reborn thunder sign

I know we will
Claim the throne and kill
They asked for war so we will give them one

The one to end it all
Reckoning with blood
Stop the madness that's gone on for centuries

In a storm of obloquy, my sons stand strong
Marshall the forces, gather up weapons for the last war to come

Who is so righteous, uncorrupted to condemn and dominate
With truth and not with illusions
Not driven by the greed to be enthroned and rule?
Havoc no more
The reign of man
