This lifeless soil
Barren of good thoughts
Scorched by grudge and grief
Doomed to linger on
Wandered aimlessly
Blinded by their lies
Now I raise my head and sword
When shadows steal the light

Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning

Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now

You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army

I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory, only emptiness I feel
The spring of hope runs dry
Because I'm already dead inside

[Solo]

I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me

Death or victory

Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning

Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now

You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army

One man army
