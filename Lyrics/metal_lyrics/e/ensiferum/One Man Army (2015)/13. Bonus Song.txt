Hear the thunder drums
Blasting in the night
Feel the guitar solo getting near
Bass is so punchy
And that's the way I like it
Vocals are fantastic
And Finnish is the language

With the lyrics whatever fits
Thunder tits!

This is what you get,
When you ask more and more.
Kiki diki bang bang all night long
We'll kick you in the balls!
Like the legend says
"TÃ¶ttÃ¶rÃ¶Ã¶, King Kong"
Ãber heavy Viking metal!
There's no sense at all!

In the lyrics whatever fits
Thunder tits!

Magic, swords, and dragons!
That's all that matters!
We wrote this song
To please you all
No cover songs to play
No wise words to say
So sing along it's a Bonus song!

[Solo]

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Petri Lindroos

Whoa
Whoa oh
[Repeat]
Vittu everybody!

Whoa
Whoa oh
[Repeat]

With the lyrics whatever fits
Fuck this shit!

Magic, swords, and dragons!
That's all that matters!
We wrote this song
To please you all,
No cover songs to play
No wise words to say
So sing along it's a Bonus song!

Shout once more!
It's a Bonus song!
It's a Bonus song!
It's a Bonus song!
Bonus song!

Booonuuus sooong!
