Only change is unavoidable,
A brave new chapter is getting closer [again],
Without a shroud of doubt he walked
The road so long. One dream, now gone.

What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

Why you withhold the pain but need those scars?
How will you leave to the unknown shores?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.

Memories, ruthless like old guilt.
Choices, accept or be haunted [since die].
No past, no future means a thing.
The very moment is all there is.

What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

Is it courage to let go or drown with a sword?
How will you face your final dawn?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.
