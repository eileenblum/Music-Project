I, I have sailed
All alone
So many times
The seven seas of tears
I can still hear the waves.

Cold frigid wind
On my sails
Always takes me back
To distant memories
Home, the last farewell.

Waves of time
Candour and lies
for what I left behind,
I know the price was high.

No tears to cry
No words to make it right
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.

I, I was lost
No star
No shore to call my own
But I didn't know
I had it all.

On the fields of victories
And defeats
A drifter's life is both
longing and dreams
then reality.

Wasted time,
Candour and lies,
For what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
[x2]

No tears to cry,
No words to make it right,
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.
