The cry for the earth bounds
Who'll face the final sundown

On the last shore of this dying world
A man, a symbol, a sword
A vague memory of something that was
But the moment takes its grasp

Horizon so calm
Harbinger of doom
Sets the sky ablaze
Torn apart by the whirl of time
Slowly, grimly all is devoured by night

Through the night we ride
Till the edge of time
Comforting death
Under the crumbling sky

Your fights
Are over now
Lay down and sleep
Gone are
All hate and love
For eternity

No eyes to see
When the last light that dwindles
Fades to nothingness
No souls to save
In the endless darkness
No hope, no forgiveness
