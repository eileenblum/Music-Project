[Grim man's tale:]
[I:]
A flaming blade of the dark shadows struck the lands
With furious lightning it fell into the hands of man
And the ancient fire came down
Down from the sky into the ground
The clouds moved aside as the sword was cast from the sky
Burnt by a mark of fire, who shall make this find
And the grey clouds were watching down, down from the sky into the ground
...As the shapes of light were drowned

[II:]
Courage's started crowling from the ashes and smoke
And the night was cursed and drifting within the winds so cold
And the knights from the sea were marching down
To the deep caverns down, down where the old spells are found
The war was growing in the old lands and towns
From the mountains war drums pounded with a deafening sound
They'll seek the Sword forevermore, until in battle they'll fall
...Now, hear the battle's call

Who dares to play with death
Who smells the dragon's breath
No grief for the fallen ones
The search for the sword has begun

[Carved in stone:]
Great as the mountains and seas
Grim as the earth and old trees
Made from the glimmer of golden lakes
Chained with fire that never fades
Rocks and stones they carve and mould
When the rivers run fierce and cold
May this chant haunt your past
For this Sword is yours at last

Raise the arms the battle is near
Through the mud and waters clear
The blood is coloring the lands again
A sign of victory the wind will send
