[x2]
HÃ¤n katsoi maan reunalta tÃ¤hteÃ¤ putoavaa
Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittÃ¤Ã¤ karu maa
Jokaisen tÃ¤ytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
SillÃ¤ aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tÃ¤mÃ¤ maa on ikuinen
[English translation]
He gazed the falling star from the edge of the world
Now the face of the maiden are covered by rough land
Everyone has to look in the eyes of the truth
Because the time is victorious, but this land is eternal

There's a place in the North, far far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fields with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall!

Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead!
Oh yea!

LAI LAI HEI!

He watched a falling star, at the edge of the world
Now the maiden's beautiful face is covered in barren earth
Everyone has to look into the eyes of the thruth,
For time is victorious, but this land will always stay true

LAI LAI HEI!
