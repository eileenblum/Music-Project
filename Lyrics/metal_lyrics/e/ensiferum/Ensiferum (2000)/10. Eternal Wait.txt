Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life

I have carried this burden so long for you
that nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
that nothing would hurt deeper than the truth

Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait

I hear your silent cry
lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
one reason to die for

I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears
