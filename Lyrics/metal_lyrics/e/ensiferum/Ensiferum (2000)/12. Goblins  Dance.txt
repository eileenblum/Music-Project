Once in the time of chaos,
of sunless days and of unhappiness
The statue of the triumphant master
stood proud and grim
In the light of three descending moons,
it twisted and cracked open
Unleashing the Goblin King,
once again, for the last time

"Now the Victory is ours!"
"Let us dance the dance of Immortals"
They shrieked, as they marched
up and down the hills,
in the sighing face of earth

Misfortune and Chaos,
Grief and Destruction
The works of Dreaming evil,
and the joy of unholiness
No soul was left alone,
in the mayhem of the human race
"Hahahahaa!!!, Let us joy, Let us dance!!!"
So they danced their macabre dances

From the three ascending moons,
moonshine was spilling onto the ground,
Gruesome trophies were all around,
In the halls of the Goblin King
