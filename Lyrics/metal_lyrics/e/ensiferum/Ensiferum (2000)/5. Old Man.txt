So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
but will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
this Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
our lives with a brighter flame

[CHORUS 1:]
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released

[CHORUS 2:]
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
[J.L.Runeberg]

[REPEAT CHORUS 1]

The stars fell from the night sky
as he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
the Old Man burst to tears

[REPEAT CHORUS 2]
