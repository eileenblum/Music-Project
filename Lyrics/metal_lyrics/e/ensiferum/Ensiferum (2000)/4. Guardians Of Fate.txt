Race with the wind
The night is ending
They will win
when the sun is rising
Stories have been told for years about the rebel man
riding in the lands of unknown
No one has ever seen their furious beings
and their secret remains untold

Their deeds shall be heard
Their legend will live forever
They are the Guardians Of Fate

As they shouted their last battle cries their destiny was to be dead
Their future was in no one's hands like the prophet of the moon had said

Those who travelled far away from home, they'll never return
and those who crossed the seas of hope, they all will burn
