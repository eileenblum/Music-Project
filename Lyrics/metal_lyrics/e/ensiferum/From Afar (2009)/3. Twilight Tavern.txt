We heard that enemies were approaching from the south
We marched to face them, I killed their scout
But we were ambushed and slaughtered in the night
We fought so bravely but none were left alive

Now I open my eyes and what do I see
A rainbow in the moonlight, pipers calling me
They say don't be afraid and asked me to follow
You've been expected, so forget your sorrow!

[Chorus:]
Their warrior's souls forever rejoice
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
TWILIGHT TAVERN!

[Bridge:]
Life is so short (Life is so short)
Oh! son of the north (Oh son of north)
You'll find your peace
At the end of your journey

[Solo]

[Verse:]
Hey! All greet us when we open the door
Familiar faces -- "Brothers, it's been too long"
Beer is flowing, the smell of burning meat
In the morning battle reigns like hell's been unleashed!

As the sun sets behind the mountains peak,
The master of the house shouts: "Drink and feast!"
This feels like it is too good to be true.
The call for the final battle will be here soon

[Chorus]
