A raven came to me,
Spoke to me in my dream.
A long lost prophecy,
A forgotten legacy.

Echoes of yesterday,
Won't let these dreams fade away.
All the beauty I adored,
At the edge of the world.

Across the universe,
Time is to be reversed.
No shelter can be found,
To this fate, we are bound!

Behold the final hour,
The last times will be dour.
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world!

"Burning skies
On the vengeance night.
Devastating scythe,
Of the ancient Light."

I saw the might,
Of the ancient Light!
And the beauty of the perishing world,
Theres no tomorrow.
We have been warned.

"The sky's bird struck fire,
Made a flame flare up.
The north wind burnt the clearing.
The north-east quite consumed it:
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust."
