Who dares to stare death in the eye?
And face the maelstrom of doom like a hero?
When light splits the sky
And like a thousand giants, thunder roars

King of storms
Descends from the skies
Before my eyes
Destroyer of worlds
King of storms

I will rule with fear and pain
Your world will burn in dragon flame

You will
Obey
Your kin
Will yield when I say

Your dreams
Your fears
Your dying screams
Belong to me

Descry the beast of the nightmare realm
Destruction of all, humanity abhorred
Ravaged land where the afflicted dwell
The frozen void entombs idle prayers and exhorts
