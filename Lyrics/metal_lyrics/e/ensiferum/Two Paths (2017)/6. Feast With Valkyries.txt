Through mist we ride
Howling wolves in moonlight
Blood has been shed tonight
It's judgement time

Gallantly you fought
Made your people proud
Rise brave warriors
The journey has just begun

High to the skies
Across the seas,
Woods of the north
And mountain peaks

The song will sound
Through history
Tonight we'll feast with Valkyries

Sons of frost and steel, reinvigorate
Stay humble not brash
Because I'm the one who chooses the slain

North wind in my hair
Only me, my steed and my spear
Charge to another battlefield
Eternal chant in the air
