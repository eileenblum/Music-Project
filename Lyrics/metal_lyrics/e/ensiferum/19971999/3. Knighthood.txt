I walk through the calm forest in the time of knights
And only the dark memories are left from these times
There's pieces of armour on skeletons
Of men lying on the ground
They were killed by the stab of the sword

Before me lays thousands of dead knights
Beneath of my feets lays skeletons
And only the dark memories
Are left of this Knighthood

On this ground all fought for domination,
But no one stayed alive
And no one knows why that even one life,
Didn't survive
It must have been the powers of evil,
That killed the rest of the men
On this bloodstained ground,
That which stories has been told
