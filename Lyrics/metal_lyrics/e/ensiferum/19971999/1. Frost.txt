[Demo (1997)]

Howling winds of the North
The cold predator of the fells
Mighty woods of the North
Under cover of darkness
Desolate and dying lands
Barren ground, covered with snow
There forever I am,
Where cold winds blow

Gathering thoughts, take me
Into a whirl of silence
Gathering thoughts, give me
Strength to survive

Wail to me my winds
Fly away with frozen wings
Take my life to your hands
O' cold wasteland... of Frost

Great land of the North
The ice shimmering upon the lakes
Great storms of the North
All life frozen to death
Freezing days of sorrow
I'm alone in this infertile world
In the year before time
