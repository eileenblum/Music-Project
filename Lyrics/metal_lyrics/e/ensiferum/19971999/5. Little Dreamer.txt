Once there was a boy back in time of the heathens
Day after day he just kept dreaming things that would make him weaker
His father could not make him see, that there is more than dreams
But he wouldn't listen to the words of his father, 'cause he's a little dreamer

Along his quest for solitude
A wise man came and told him to follow the stars

He ran to the forest with whirlwinds by his side
He's lost in this world of lies
Take him back where rivers flow upwards
He is the one who lives under a moonless sky looking for time
Take him back where stars are shining bright

Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
Pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
Memories are drifting away so silently from light

Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...
