High above the ground
Beyond the thunderclouds
A Black shade is flying alone
Once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold

Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

A Den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it is time to spread the wings of doom
A Growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky

The era of total chaos will arrive
Men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls
I'll burn their flesh and I'll crush their bones

Now they shall know
That every myth told is true
They shall burn on my blazing gallows

Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

Your screams can't make me feel pity or regret
I only feel furious hatred
With fire my dominion is gained
So burn away and let my kind rule the world again
