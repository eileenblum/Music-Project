Through the storm like the wind we ride
Leaving it all far behind
Another war is straight ahead
This fight will give us all
None shall live , they all will fall
When the new dawn arises, we stand tall

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

Feel your strength and let it rise
Hear the call of their demise
Let them feel your steel
Have faith my friend, this is not the end
Our time is near, we feel your fear
Because we will...

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

Nothing can stop us now
As we march towards the final fight
It waits us in the night
Our swords are taking lives
Giving us what is ours
Now the new dawn arises and we have it all

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
