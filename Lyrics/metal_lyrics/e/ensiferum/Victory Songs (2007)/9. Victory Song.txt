The plan of invasion
an Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God

The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We're outnumbered
But our destiny is to win

FIGHT!
Fight with the rage of a bear!
DEFEND!
Our homeland!
CRUSH!
Crush every enemy!
AND SEAL!
Our victory!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Ei urhot kaukaisen Pohjolan
Uhan eessÃ¤ taipuneet
JÃ¤lleen pauhaa kansi taivahan
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen
Moni nÃ¤hdÃ¤ ei saa enÃ¤Ã¤ huomista
Moni jÃ¤Ã¤ heitÃ¤ kaipaamaan
JÃ¤lkipolville jÃ¤Ã¤ maa rauhaisa
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan!

[English translation:]

The braves of the north
Didn't give in before the threat
Again the sky dome rumbles
Blood stains the snow
Many don't get to see tomorrow
Many will be missed
Land remains peaceful for progeny
Songs of victory will sound forever)

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
