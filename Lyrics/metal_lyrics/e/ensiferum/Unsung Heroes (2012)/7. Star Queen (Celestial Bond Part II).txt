The traveller's heart is meant to be free
No obligations and soul redeemed
I knew that part wasn't for me
When I met my star queen

Born in stars, like all of us
But can two paths start from one?
Unite again somewhere in time
And light the brightest star in the endless sky

Oh Queen of Stars
How long until
Oh Queen of Stars
Dreams are fulfilled?

Years go by I thought I could forget
I lived in a lie, that's all I regret
It's better for a man to die by the sword
Than wither away with undying love

I wish that the wind will play with her hair
Touch her lips, tell I'll be there
Longing for the moment for eternity
Light of a thousand stars will always comfort me
