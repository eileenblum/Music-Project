Where to find the truth?
Questions linger through time
Unbreakable will and inquiring mind
Have always been the seeker's guide

The Reason as my sword
The Knowledge as my shield
I'll face my foes again and again
On the ancient battlefield

I can't deny what I've seen
So towards the great unknown
I must keep going on

Stop your quest
Or with fire you'll be cleansed
Confess...
Death...

Woe to the faith
Through dark centuries
The wait for the time
When all is revealed

Unbreakable
Stands through time
Dwells the proof of life
Eternal Earth of mine

Cleanse our souls
No good thoughts shall burn
Engulf the passion of life
Eternal Fire of mine

Carry it on
The ancient wisdom of mankind
Eternal Air of mine

Renew us within
Wash away
The remains of lies
Eternal Water of mine

Indivisible
Beyond death and life
The answer divine
Eternal Elements of mine

The gatekeeper of the knowledge
The One who was trusted the secrets of time and space once said:
To know is your destination
To find is your possibility
And to search is your quest.

Your path has merged with the truth.
But yet you refuse to see it
It's easier to be afraid, to be deceived, to be a sheep
Be aware, question them, question yourself
Because once you see it, you can never look away

Every man's
Horizon can change
But eternal skies
Will always stay the same

Like a new sun arises from winter's cold and dark grave, it's unstoppable.

Keep your twisted beliefs
Sons and Daughters of Dawn are calling me

The fire that burns my flesh
Shall light up the words I've said
The curse on my innocent name
Shall put all of you in shame

Woe to the man
Who disheartens the few
Who reach for the light
Who searches for the truth

I only have just one more wish
That this torch will be passed onto someone sentient like you
When your time comes, don't lose your heart
Have faith and patience and trust in the flame before passing it onto someone new

The greatest power of all
Will force their gods to fall
The greatest power of all
Embrace, illuminate all!

I am, you are, no one's slave
No man or god they have made
