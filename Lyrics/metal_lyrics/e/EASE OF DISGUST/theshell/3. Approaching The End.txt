Wait for your everyday portion of lies
Addicted to self brain demise
Distortion emphasizes irreality

Pray this life
Cause that's the only way you see this life
Cause that's the only way you learn to be a human.being
Without humanity

Hypnotized, necrotised
Online
Dehumanized, fucking lobotomized
Online

God
Runs through your veins
Affects your brains
Downgrades the consciousness itself
God
Inside digits
That makes you see
Your own indignity

Told how to live, how to die
How to waste your fucking time
How to be just one more stone within the church of
Lies

Approaching the end with the smile of a friend
Leading straight to the abyss of void
Making your eyes insensate to the lights
To the borders of sickening truth

Hypnotized
Necrotised
Sacrificed
Vaporized

Pray this life
Cause that's the only way you see this life
Cause that's the only way you learn to be a human.being
Without your fucking humanity

Time
To close your eyes
To realize
To see what you've become
