What do you Feel Falling INTO the Darkest sleep?
So tell Me What now, What Would u if u Feel Could Walk through the spaces on the path made ââof your Dreams? All of you Chose the Wrong path You'll Never See Those That verges I Feel Your eyes Are Blinded Walleye Covers your faces Damnation Will Never This end I do not need the answer I know EXACTLY IT You See Only Shadows of yours You Have to Pray to Avoid this place Which Gives Birth to FEAR in your Hearts And u Will try to sleep again and again With Cold Sweat on your faces And immersing in your Worlds I reject myself Discovering My Ego! I See Everything All the colors I did not forget your name The time stops again and again It dominates My underself no More Summoning all the Demons from the Abyss I Will Give all forbidden fruits of My life For the chance to touch the great Knowledge of Dark matter How Could ancestors exchange this path And start to build the new World around? You Betrayed us You yourselves for the Betrayed sake of Gold Killing FEAR and Infinite Weakness Are Our ââlegacy right now Will Remain Only Hatred Inside us Will Remain in Our Hearts.
