Eternal mazes of time
enveloped in Darkness Are of Riddles
And now They Are illuminated
With the false Prophet's Light
And all the Human Race
to the fed Are Lies on the surface They do not Want to See the Gospel Even under Sunlight You Should Think your Own way You've got the Only Truth in your Heart pure Keep IT out from Winds of Lust And save IT Inside of you Your Mind is Fully Blind You've got no your Own Thoughts And Another Grasp's Views Not seeing the Difference You refused to See the starlight of time Which Leads us to the Truth We Speak no word, We Keep the Silence Picking the Bones thrown from Above Your eyes Are Blinded, you Hear no sounds You grope your way in the Darkness Turn on the Light of fairness sacred And destroy the borders on your way The Voice of Hatred Will Move Ahead you And no one you CAN Stop now! Illuminate Illuminate Illuminate And wipe out this Darkness The War of Minds Will overflow this World Full of ignorance, full of filthy Lust And the Ground Will be shuddered By trample of Mindless machines And if you do not Want the World to be Confined Open your eyes and break through the Shell The universe is waiting for the Truth!
