I See one More
Empty Shell with no esteem
Who breathes and walks
And Forms Our new Society
I See a spineless slave under Control
The Same like legions of ignorant clones Look INTO My eyes and tell Me Can you Remember the WHO Fuck you Are So-Called Human Being with Artificial Mind Can you Remember the White Light in Front of your eyes When They just Turned you on When They Were Playing gods Where`s your life? What`s the Point of Existence your here? You Were Constructed Where`s your soul? What Makes you an Identity? You Were Constructed What do you know About the new skin Sewn to you Upon your Scars How IT`s like To be Assembled Entirely INSTEAD of Being Alive You`re Smiling With Bleeding stabwounds With Severe Bruises With Mouth full of Blood BUT Bleeding Still doesn`t make you a Human Until you`re a Toy In the Hands of your gods Who Gave you all you`ve That got BUT your Own life Who made ââyou all your Genes Bred Who Who webbed your Tissues and strained your skin They crushed down your Integrity Pushing through IT They Deprived you of Will Power They just HAD you Constructed.
