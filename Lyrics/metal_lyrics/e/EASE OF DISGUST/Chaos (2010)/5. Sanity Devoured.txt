Slaughterhouse under Blood-Red skies
Tongues of Flame cremating piles of Dead Bodies
Dead Skinless faces Covered with flies
Are Smiling direly No single piece Of Human Flesh Only Just Remnants of Bodies, Bones Only just Scraped out with Teeth of starving carnivores I saw Them Devouring Each Other Disemboweling Bodies Were Still Alive Which I saw Them Feeding Their Hunger They Destroyed Cities and Their Them Drowned in Blood Hunger Has killed all Our Compassion And now Our sanity is fed to instincts Hunger Consumed something Vital What made ââus humane And now We hunt and Eat Ourselves I Don`t Want To Become One of you I`m SO Scared To Lose Control And fall I CAN Feel Pain Cutting CAN I Hear Starving Voice Tells Which I`ve got choice No I Don`t Want us to be flayed and dismembered to serve as a food to Each Other To cross That line To regress INTO animals As Long as I breath I Will Stand My Ground I Will leash My Hunger before I`m Consumed From the Inside My Mind Before is hazed with Blood Before I Betray myself Before I Erase myself Before I Paint the Floor with your Bloody traces Break your Limbs and Mutilate your faces Tear your skin and push My Hands INTO your guts And then I start Slaughterhouse under Blood-Red skies Tongues of Flame incinerating the Dead Skinless Dead faces Covered with flies Will Never See What I`m going to do with you all cattle Fucking.
