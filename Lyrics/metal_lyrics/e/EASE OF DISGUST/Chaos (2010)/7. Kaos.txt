Chaos CAN be Revealed Throughout the Existence, within the Ultimate and the Least Creations
Chaos is an element of Any ambience, of universe, and of Our World of a MAN
It exists in absolute Nothingness, in nihility, Which CAN be Imagined Not with the Mind of a Human
Chaos is Multidimensional and simultaneously Has no dimension
It contains time and timelessness, space and IT `s Absence
It is the Beginning of Everything; all Being WAS created from Chaos
All That Has exists CAME out of Chaos, IT `s and Everything Nothing at the Same time
Chaos is IT `s Own Beginning and IT` s Own Creation, Which Creates and destroys in IT `s Infinite Formation
Chaos Zero is a dimension, Which Holds all Revealed and unrevealed dimensions within Itself
is Chaos Eternal Progress and Lawless Formation, and wishes to Cosmos bound with IT IT`s Limited Forms
The lawlessness of Chaos is Not chained by the Laws of Causality, Stability and boundedness of space Structures
Evolution is an Instrument of Chaos to Accelerate the returning of Everything INTO Chaos, and stagnation - is a mean of Cosmos to retain everything in it`s bounded shape, law and structure.
