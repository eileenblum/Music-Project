Are the beams coming through
as soon As They touch Me
My body is just a Black Spot in your eyes
I've got no Shadow on this burning Ground
I Feel Inside of Me something I CAN Pass through visible All Obstacles And no one CAN Hold Me now I Will Follow My path Everything That My eyes See CAN Does Not matter no More This is a feast in the times of Plague Only Lie around and envy in the So Look and See your mirror faces Ugly They Are Drown in the Waters of Fallen In the Waters of ignorance You Reached the limit of your Lives And Light Turned INTO the Darkness Now your Smiling faces Are just like this on your masks Jackal napes and Everything is changed otherwise element And no one is Able To See the Flame of Truth right now It ` s just a flat reflection of Reality I found myself Have! I Have My conscious refused Ego And dissolve myself in Your Knowledge of eternity! Hatred And Fills My Lungs And if you Are the Light I'll stay on the Other Side The screams of Pain Are overfilling My Head And hate Has Occupied My Heart So Look Inside Me and My Flame See It blazes in Me It gathers all the damned around Me So Long stay Saint SO I wish to See you Crucified For My Sins I Want to See My Hands Imbued with your Deeds With your Blessing Deeds.
