Aching Pain Pierces through My Head
My loneliness is the Pay for the gift
I WAS conferred by the gods
After My Endless Wandering Among People I wandered through the Worlds Looked at the faces and Tried to Understand and Find Anyanswers forthe questions asks the Chaos Mere mortals Realization CAME to Me in My Dreams Prophetic Breathers Are self-destructive as They Live in Illusive Worlds Creating ephemeral Dales They Are afraid ofthe Doom They Hide Themselves in lots of empty dogmas and Laws They Eliminate this Realm right here and right now They Are Stuck in the Obscure Swamp of ignorance Between nowhere and Never Within the Ice ancestry of Mind The blizzard is coming, IT Will Bring the Pain youdeserve And I Hear screaming through the howling of Wind Aching Pain Pierce through My Head My loneliness is the Pay for the gift I WAS conferred by the gods Oh, Lords of time Has Become Your Damnation My gift To See the World in two colors Watching the life Fades Sensing Dark eternity of this Dead Silence Far away from disgusting hypocrisy.
