Loosened tongues we cut them out.
We curse your flesh for dark thoughts.
We spite your names forgotten loss.
We'll cut you from within.
Damaged pride will resurface inside your broken spirit.
We hunt you down and take what's yours.
We'll escape your hate.

Carve out our destiny, we'll take back what is ours.
Respawn from within, we bow before no man.

You will not survive this fight.
We'll burn down your homes
And scatter the ashes on our lost ones graves.
This struggle follows me through life.
Your victims we will avenge tonight.
Their faces will haunt me.

Damaged eyes they see no more.
You can't see the threat around you.
Falling around in the darkness you pray for safety.
Fists shower down and boots kick in.
They stamp on your fucking pride.
Broken ribs and bruised egos.
You cannot run, you cannot hide.

You will fall. You will fall down.
