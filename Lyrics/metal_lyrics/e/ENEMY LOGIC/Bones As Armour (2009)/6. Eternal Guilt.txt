What the fuck did I do?
Can never undo the past.
Just look through my eyes
They never follow the light.
What the fuck did I do?
Can't stop the pain that will eat through you.
I throw it back in your face
The hate inside that will lead me to you.

Down your guard and role there's nothing to feel
And now I'm going to take you there.
Renounce your faith and futile ways.
If you escape this you'll never succeed.
Raise the hate and tear through the weak.
You will evolve and transcend this mess.
If you don't concur I will be forced
To make your choice, an open grave.

Your most venomous ways, they resist what you pray.
I can't feel you, I can't feel your pulse.

Blaze through the masses and spare no one.
You're no longer like any of them.
Don't act like you care I know you now.
I know you're as lost as me, my soul is yours.
Cut away the pain and feel the grief.
They know you're the leader of a final stand.
Don't make me have to hurt you friend.
Even though we're now one, I'll rip you out.

Unlock the truth. Realise the lies.
End it all.
