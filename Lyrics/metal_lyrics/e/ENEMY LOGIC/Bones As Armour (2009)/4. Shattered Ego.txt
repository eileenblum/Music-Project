Now redeem your disgrace.
Take your pills tonight.
Stab yourself with needles.
Broken glass by your side.
Blood runs down your arms.
Tears run down your face.
Ask your broken self
was this shit worth your life?

Can you stand by yourself?
There's nowhere in the dark to hide.
Reject it all except your fate
From those who taught you otherwise.
Can you stand back on your feet?
Respect yourself, get off your knees.
Stand again on broken limbs.
Compose yourself and then you'll see.

Raise from your grave
And I will stand by you.
Forgive and remorse
And I redeem and triumph.

Now renounce your sins.
Pay for your crimes.
Pay with your blood.
Shattered ego in your mind.
Poison through your veins.
Smoke through your lungs.
Ask your broken self
Was this shit worth your life?

Control your own life.
Stand again, take back what is yours.
