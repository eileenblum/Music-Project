This flesh, it burns in the fire.
Broken bodies, blackened bones in the ashes.
Unmarked iron in the fire, invincible.
I will never fucking burn.
This corpse is down by the river, washed up hatred.
Fucking drowned in the water, unknown victim.
Another day, once more chance.
Make a change, seize this time.
On your grave from this life.
Fall of the sun.
On your knees from disgrace.
Pierced from within.
You will unmask this man.
You will follow this corpse to his grave.
This time we'll plan it all our way, we will survive.
Injured pride in our bodies, savaged power.
In the fire, invincible.
I will never fucking burn.
Revolution on its way, we will stand now.
Rising again in your honour, angered victim.
One more revolution.
