This time you will lose this heart you took from me last time.
You bitch, fuck this, fuck all you've taken away from me.
From my past, my soul that bleeds for you.
Fuck away our past, fuck that.
Take away the years, our years.
You will always know what you've done, done to me.
Drive it down inside, thrust this knife inside my heart.
Redemption is mine, I've taken it from you.
I've taken it away, I've taken back what's mine.
Throw away our dreams, throw away.
Taking back our love from you.
Your past haunts me now, thought of us - you and me.
Drive it down inside, thrust this knife inside my heart.
