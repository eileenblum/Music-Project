Right from wrong, wrong from right.
We cannot tolerate this life.
You made your choice.
The choices you make govern your life.
You are one of them, not one of our brethren.
These chains of fear.
The chains of your past you must shed.
Looking, looking through time and space.
Searching, searching for paradise.
Tonight we dine in hell.
No more fucking around in my house.
