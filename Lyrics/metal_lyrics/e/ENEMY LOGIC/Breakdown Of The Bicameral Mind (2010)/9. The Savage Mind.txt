Cut out this eye, look inside yourself.
Find what you've become inside a maze of hate.
Search for yourself deep.
Your consciousness lost inside a broken mind.
One more chance to live.
Our condition makes us whole, makes us one, forever in honour.
Break out of here. Fight another day.
This adrenaline inside such tired veins.
Rage courses though my mind.
Legions of fear tear across my skin.
Break the enemy.
Cut the noose, fall on down to the trap door.
