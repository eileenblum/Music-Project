Cold as ice, freezing in the dark.
I can't force my way through the night.
You will always fear, fear the twilight.
This one is for you, the one who suffered last.
Losing my mind through spite, hatred's how I live.
This will never last forever.
You will fall and we will never give up our past and fight.
Tear down the dark and fill with light.
You will fight. You will fight for your life.
Heart of stone, your audacity screws over your friends.
Stealing away their pride, left them for dead.
Take away what's theirs, take away their life.
Leave them with nothing except their will to fight.
Tear down the dark and fight.
