Attack with offence, your life is on trial.
Never turn your back, a knife in your name.
Never seize the day without innocence.
Always start a fight, trepidation in your blood.
Now you'll never change your ways.
Change your path, change your life.
Now it's time to realise.
Look inside, fear this time.
Lost, we've lost this one, we've lost all we had.
Sentenced now today, a court on command.
Fearing stares of shame, a cell with your name.
Away with the key, mercy fucked away.
Sent down to death row, intimidation is your foe.
Reform your ways.
