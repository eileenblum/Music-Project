Ride out independent
Demand to be seen
Homage to the system
Beneath you redeem
Blinded by the shadows
Only to retrieve
Blind mans got his wisdom
Object to believe

I cannot explain in calamity words 
Grieving down my spine
Nocturnal dwelling is a clear to me 
Your fatal entity online

Is that your belief?
Can't you see between?
Beyond the rotted lines
Betrayal intertwined
If you knew the truth
That's misleading you
Digest and suck your guilt
I know the truth prevails

Down and lost
Repressed soldier follow the hallowed fight
Depict as an enemy
You despise

How long for you to give into reason
Exploit your cunning words
Can you explain the real
The real meaning
Transcribe your bloody worth

Abrubt / corrupt the founding formation
Reject the source with means
Instill the mess of your fornication
Dilute it with greed

Breakout misconception
Defile and erode
Grievance and affliction 
Opressed pain so cold

I cannot explain in calamity words
Grieving down my spine
Nocturnal dwelling is a clear to me
Your fatal entity online
My god the savage derailed
Bloody horror so divine
Corruption comes as the damage is made
Till the feud draw lines

And so you patronize
Only to defy
A challenge that you bear
Within contempt you swear
Within beloved truth
Nothing real to you
Another fiction lie
A kind that makes you hide...
