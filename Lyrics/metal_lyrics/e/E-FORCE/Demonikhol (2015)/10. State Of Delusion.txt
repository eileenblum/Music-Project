Now and then got to face the world in doubt
Face it all
Read them well
Always out on the long and dreaded path
Conflict becomes default

Believe it's forgotten 
All seems to fade away
No reason for havoc
It happens anyway
Do or die
If you wanna live
Do expect anarchy
All in all got to bleed the world someway
Count them all
Or lose sight

Believe it's forgotten
All seems to fade away
No reason for havoc
It happens everyway
Silence
Torment
Fight the world
Reload
Trial
Promise
Challenge all alone

Conclusion
Regardless
Retarded / high and low
Fall into formation
That leaves you blind and deaf
And now you have no will to carry on
Carry on

You see the chaos and it's far beyond the sky
It begins to crack
No need to lecture as your failing gonna die
New eternal end
Your paralyzed and you can't move on again
You begin to rot
A kronik fear that you formed inside
Delirious
You see the chaos and it's far beyond the sky
It begins to crack
No need to lecture as your burning gonna fry
New eternal end

Now and then got to face the world in doubt
Fraudulent
Read them well
Bord alone
Count myself again
Doubt below 
To forgive

Believe it's forgotten
All seems to fade away
No reason for havoc
A problem everyday
Silence 
Damage
Until your gonna break
Silence 
Torment
Got to get away

All I know
Trust myself again
Don't be long
Don't forget
