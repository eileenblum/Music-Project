What a maze of burden
Across the sky
Another faze of ruin
Devious
Haze of torment
Vagabond bribe
Deviation
He vast collide

Into a world of sorrow 
Drift to an empty place 
Enter a new tomorrow 
Can't find the easy way

Descend in battle
Remain at ease
Triggered lost shadows
Dark sides precede

To return / outcast
Damn you all
Insidious mind control
Introverted life deformed
The promise of hate
Fuck!

Until the day
I tell you so 
It's going to be like that

To watch all the ruckus
See them burning down
Kill for treason
Unbound
Fight the enemy
Until its clear
A mindless frenzy
Deliriums near

Want to return / outcast
Damn you all 
Insidious mind control 
Introverted life deformed 
Deceptive life on board 
Pervasive grind detour
