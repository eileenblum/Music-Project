Living in a rage all full of digression
Gotta confront
Face an ultimatum
Apprehensive
So direct
Distorted vision
Amorous

Follow the necessary
Don't prelong
A bloody visionary
All gone wrong
So up the anti
Unrestrained
Denounce the problem
Burden that remains

Ultimatum
Mass control
Regulation
Forewarned
Mercenary
Inhuman
Diabolic
Vicious

Deplete the new device
Lost in another light
Into a world of shame
Interact
Forewarned

Gotta give force till you're done the breaking
Lost 'em all
Tired of waiting
There's no doubt
Do it well
Bring me down
It's gonna bring us hell

Begin the new advice
A ruthless world of lies
Beyond what has been saved
I'll find a better way

Forewarned
Way
Forewarned
