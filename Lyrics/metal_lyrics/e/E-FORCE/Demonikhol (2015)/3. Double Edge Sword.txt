Far gone
The chemical abuse
Revise
The actions you display
Redefine
Trauma that is made

Get started
Or return - abolish
No life till overturned

Hear now / ain't no matter of respect
Deal out / disregard the painless threat
Vindicate / up hold and justify
Violate / debauch upon defile

Get started
Or return - abolish overturned
Beridden
Beyond sane - contorted
An illusion that remains

Make no mistake
Evaluate
The double edge sword

Descend overload
Regress you've been told

Fall out / unruly and distinct
Direct
Order and sustain
Bedlam
Disorder gone deranged
Confront
Stand and face the blade

Get ready
Or return - abolish
Overturned
Beridden
Beyond sane
Contorted an illusion that remains

Make no mistake
Evaluate
Murder and fate
Its not too late
The double edge sword
