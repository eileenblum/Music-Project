Out below
Down again
Can't be long
Tolerant

Can't wait
To reload again
Can't take this bloody war
Restrain
Not alone today
Refrain
Uncertain

Debauchery
That sets me free
Leading me
To foresee

Release to unholy lies
Beneath wrong or right
Create adamant thoughts within
To escape this bloody hell

Enter a new debate
Lost inside
Can't help but analyze
The things that I despise
Redeem and patronize
Your fuckin' shame
Rethink your time will tell
Grieving your mind will swell
Begin to anticipate
Get drunk and deviate

Debauchery 
Out below 
Down again 
Can't be long tolerant

Rewake
Or loose a limb too late
Far gone
Intake
Triumph supreme a world
Forlorn
