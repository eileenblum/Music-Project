[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Stranded amongst the highest mountain
Unseen by the human eye
Knowing our voices cannot be heard
As many soon will die
Sub zero - freezing
Blinding snow - no end in sight
Isolation - nullified
Will we survive the night?

Will no one hear our distant cries?
My life has flashed before my eyes

Without no food or shelter
Our chances to survive are low
Having lost our sense of direction
Will we escape this arctic cold?
As we eye this glacier prison
Knowing all but hope is lost
The plane crash - now has left
Our bodies numb from frost
Will no one hear our distant cries?
My life has flashed before my eyes

Prey - we will die if we stay
Escape - we have to find a way

[Solo - Slav, Glen]

Seeming endless journey
Our bodies are too numb from pain
We have the will and heart
But will we see the rest again?

Prey - we will die if we stay
Escape - we have to find a way
