[Music: S. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

We - are one in the same
My heart grows fonder every day
Now - you don't recall my name
Forever - never be the same

Please stay away
I spill the blood of pain
I breathe your soul
How hard I try to refrain

Eternity - my mental scars surely remain
Forevermore - I will now show you my pain

I - try to make amends
Until you spit on me again

Please stay away
I spill the blood of pain
I breathe your soul
How hard I try to refrain

[Solo - Shawn, Slav, Glen]

Please stay away
I spill the blood of pain
I breathe your soul
How hard I try to refrain

Eternity - my mental scars surely remain
Forevermore - I will now show you my pain

[Solo - Glen]
