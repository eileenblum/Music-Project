[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

The missions clear
Obtaining information - vital
Preventing mass obliteration
Sent back in time - As I surpass the speed of light
To save mankind from self destruction

Viral Decay - creation of a twisted science
Transparent to the human eye
A new regime - manifesting revolution
Once exposed - 5 billion die!

Chasing time
Twisting Fate
Preventing misfortune
Is it to late? 

[Solo - Glen]

Malefic act - deleting files I've tried to gather
The missions failed - return to future
Our fate is sealed - a world that's headed for destruction
As we approach the zero hour
