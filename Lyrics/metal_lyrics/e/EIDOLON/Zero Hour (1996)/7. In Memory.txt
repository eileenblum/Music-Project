[Music: S. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

I raise my head up from my pillow
Thoughts of pain and sorrow
Can't sweep the memory from my mind
Another day to try to handle
Visions from my past
The fear of knowing you are gone
Will no one care to hear my scream of desperation?
I raise my hands up to the sky

I will move on - erase the pain inside me

I want to die every time I hear your name
I need some time to help myself erase the pain
A piece of mind - serenity to live again

[Solo - Glen, Slav]

The day will come
I will regain the will to start a new life
The memory of you lives on
