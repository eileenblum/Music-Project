[Music: G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Everyday a constant battle
Fighting to survive
I prey oh god please let me stay alive
Bodies scattered everywhere
Soldiers left to die
The war continues with no end in sight

As the battle rages on - enemy in sight
Artillery in hand - enhance the fight
I feel the end is coming near - but how will I survive
When decimation brings no hope to life

As dawn falls upon distant skies
The blue aurora of the moon
Beams light upon the decay of humanity
As I scurry low in deep trenches
I wonder if I shall ever again
See the birth of a new day
Blood-soaked visions race through my mind
As I hold tightly onto the threads of sanity
I prey deliverance to god
As soldiers of misfortune rot in a nameless grave

Solo - Glen

As I hear the wounded screaming
"Please don't let me die"
Laying low I hang my head and cry
As soldiers drift into eternal seas of red
What's to gain when all of us lie dead?
