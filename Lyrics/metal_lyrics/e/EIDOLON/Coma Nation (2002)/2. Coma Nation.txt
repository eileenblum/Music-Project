One united pulse that dangles - lifeless by a chain
Suspended by his grip - non-moral - he is pain
Sucking away the lives - to make his power more
Sick vengeance he is seeking - to last even the score

Reaching for the culmination
From within the coma nation

Past aeons filled with anguish - the suffering - insane
Skinned alive - the innocent - the boiling point engaged
Lifeless souls then gathered - to make their power one
Morphesizing into darkness - true vengeance has begun

Reaching for the culmination
From within the coma nation

We won't abandon hate
We seek the twisted fate
Temptation far to great
Their death is what we crave

[Solo]

Floated state or meridian - skin begins to tear
Decaying bodies pale - too sickening to bear
Day of vengeance has arrived - euphoria obtained
Triumph through out lifeless souls - my power is ordained

Reaching for the culmination
From within the coma nation
