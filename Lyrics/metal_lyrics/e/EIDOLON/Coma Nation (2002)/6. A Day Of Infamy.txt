Faceless coward - slithering - the depths a mind can take
Blackened heart - alerting masses - a plan - the world to shake
Now no one will ever be the same

How could we have ever known? No prediction to have known
Will and honour - now be shown!

Standing unified - the nations will collide
Vengeance will be swift - we pray for your demise

The city begins to shake - behold the blackened sky
Unsuspecting people watch - can't believe their eyes
Terror unfolds - who to despise

How could we have ever known? No prediction to have known
Will and honour - now be shown!

We never will forgive - interrupt the way we live
Teach your people how to hate - run and hide, but it's too late

[Solo]

There is no place to hide - in time we'll hunt you down
The coward flees for life - our nations are abound
We will not stop until you're found

Standing unified - the nations will collide
Vengeance will be swift - we pray for your demise
