Running or hiding - you'll never escape
Live for the promise - now you won't betray
You try to leave - I'll hunt you down

Eye-lock at first glance - first living in romance
Years down the path - there is no second chance
Until you pass - you will be mine

I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave - now you will pay
I'll never stop to find a way - you dug your grave!

Promises made - til the end you obey
Trapped in my web - there is no other way
There's no way out - this you will learn

Plead as you will - my mind you can't change
Drift to illusion - your thoughts rearranged
Abandon me - now you will burn

I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave - now you will pay
I'll never stop to find a way - you dug your grave!

[Solo]

Living my life - to obliterate yours
Beg for forgiveness - now down on all fours
Too late to turn the hand of time

Human condition - to lie and to sin
Heart into pieces - now nobody wins
The mental scars can never heal

I'll never stop to find a way
You dug your grave - now you will pay
I'll never stop to find a way - you dug your grave!
