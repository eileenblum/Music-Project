You take a stand - for what you feel is right
A vague connection to your master plan
You feel my grip - cutting you down to size
Mental destruction, fall into my hands

My life is agony - now face the enemy ...

Erase emotion, detached in memory
Communication now I bear my soul
It is too late - the pain too much to take
How many times must I beg for you to stay?

My life is agony - now face the enemy

Crying out in vain - pleading for your pain
Driving me insane - you life I can't erase

[Solo]

My darkest hour, you seek a better life
Moving on to find new lease on life
Wither away, a shell of former self
Humiliation cuts me like a knife

My life is agony - now face the enemy

Crying out in vain - pleading for your pain
Driving me insane - you life I can't erase

[Solo]
