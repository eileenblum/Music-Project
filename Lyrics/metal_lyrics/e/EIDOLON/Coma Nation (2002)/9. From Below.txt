Arise from slumber - they claw their way from depth
Nefarious moonlight - sloth their path to death
Infra-red vision - there is no way to hide
Continued seeking - to bury you alive

From below they will arise to repay
From below they will arise

Another capture - screaming in the night
Ripping then severed - achieve their endless plight
Weight of the soil - is far too much to bear
Every breath taken - closer to your last

From below they will arise to repay
From below they will arise

The endless slumber - your vision now starts to fade
Abandoned heartbeat - the mind begins to rage
Clawing away - avenging your decay
Joining the undead - you sloth your way to hate

From below they will arise to repay
From below they will arise
