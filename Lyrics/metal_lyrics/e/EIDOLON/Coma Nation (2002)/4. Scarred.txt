Balled up - enter the pain
Fists of fury - the deafening blows
Ridiculed by drunken rage
Unleashing the beast within

Repeated sickness - pray in vain - to be denied
Mental scars that never heal - in quiet misery

Huddled in darkness - a wide-eyed nightmare
Together - maintain a sense of sanity
To speak the truth - intensified hatred
The mind takes you to a better place

Repeated sickness - pray in vain - to be denied
Mental scars that never heal - in quiet misery

My god - what is this pain? Why must I feel so alone?
What makes him release all this pain? A family torn to shreds
Secretly unified - in hatred and vengeance - 
For years of torment and misery
Now I live for the day - for us to see eye to eye
You stand before me and then you die - for mental scars never heal!

[Solo]

Horrified coward - forgotten my face?
Intensifying - my chance to repay
Praying to god you now scream MY name
Vengeance is mine, the last breath you take

Repeated sickness - pray in vain - to be denied
Mental scars that never heal - in quiet misery
