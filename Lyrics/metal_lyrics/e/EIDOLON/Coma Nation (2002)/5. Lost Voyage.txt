[Theme]

Sail amidst the open sky - the quest is now reality
Beauty and grace - we blaze the trail - the seas eternity
Floating away into a world of forever

No land in sight - only sea and faded sky
The days now pass - as reality becomes illusion

Lost voyage on the sea of dreams

Meditation - serenity - never knowing the fear that lies ahead
Now trapped within the waves of fury
Splintered our ship to pieces - fading screams are washed away
Who will see another day?

No land in sight - only sea and faded sky
The days now pass - as reality becomes illusion

Lost voyage on the sea of dreams

[Solo]

Endless waves crashing down - to wash away the lifeless souls
All there's left to do is hope
Clinging to life - abandoned dreams - will no one hear my final screams!
As I drift into the sea of red

Lost voyage on the sea of dreams
