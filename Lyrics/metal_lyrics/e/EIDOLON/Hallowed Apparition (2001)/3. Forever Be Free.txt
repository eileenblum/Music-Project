Begin the quest - a clear destination
we hit top speed - without hestitation
a dangerous journey - but one we are willing to take

One on one with destiny - fate is sealed, behold the key
emancipation for theose who are willing to die

Forever be free

Minds are focused - the prize we have eyes on
crossing landscapes - ablaze the horizons
goodwill and fortune yet no one has ever escaped

Pray
to be free again
saved
ending their painy

Forever be free

From out of nowhere - not heeding theiry warning
malicious rampage - now we lay here dying
the ones who warned us are sealing our fate as we die

Forever be free
