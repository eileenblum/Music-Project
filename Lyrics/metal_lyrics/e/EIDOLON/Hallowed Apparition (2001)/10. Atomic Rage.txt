Seraphic shadows descend across the violent sky
in search for life - amidst the terrace they shall loom
the lifeless landscapes - a victim of it's own demise
a legions reached it's impending doom

Through negligence - segregation will take aim
as freedom falls - they all will pay
from mass indignities - our nation will not fail
victorious at any price

We fall through atomic rage

Holding onto the hand that waves no more
release their spirits to the sky
how can this be? the innocent is slaved by fury
through corruption of mankind

Through negligence - segregation will take aim
as freedom falls - they all will pay
from mass indignities - our nation will not fail
victorious at any price

All now is lost - by those we thought impervious to pain
incredulous - deceit as we now lay here crucified

We fall through atomic rage
