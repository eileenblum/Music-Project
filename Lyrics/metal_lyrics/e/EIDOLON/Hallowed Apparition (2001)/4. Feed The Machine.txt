You see the world - through a haze of black
the waking moments - live for mind alterations
now focus to obtain - the dragon's needle

Escape the misery - as i float on air
the world before me - now has ceased
washed away - into the chemical abyss

Feed the need
feed the greed
feed the deed
feed the machine

You live for the needle
You're losing the battle to win
buying into the denial
you're dying in vein
can't you see - you're dying in vein

Main line's grip - now deceased of dignity
and through it all - you lose it all
for sharp puncture - into scathed flesh

Feed the need
feed the greed
feed the deed
feed the machine
