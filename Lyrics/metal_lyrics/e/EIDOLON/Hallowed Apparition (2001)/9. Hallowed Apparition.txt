Corruption of the mind - i live my life unscathed
a small donation of green - will wash my sins away
hypocrisy unveiled - a small price to pay
for the pain you will endure - i'm saved another day

Hallowed apparition

I hang my head in shame - my hands held to the sky
i kneel before the cross - as i ask the holy, why?
mindset unholy - leaves a sacrilegious scar
the hallowed apparition - has save my soul thus far

Hallowed apparition

Confess unto my sins - my anguish - so unreal
can't eraese the blood - i long for the pin you feel
look into my soul - wretched visions of hate
i repent before the cross and test the hand of fate

Hallowed apparition
