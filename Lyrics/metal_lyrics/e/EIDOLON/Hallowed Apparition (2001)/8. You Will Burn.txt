Waiting to see - if you're an illusion 
revealing the curse - of my retribution
fight for your freedom - the killer contains you
lucid injustice my system unveils you.....to burn

You will burn

Mind filled with darkness - there is no redemption
as i lay low - waiting your crucifixion

No moment will pass - that i don't condemn you
as your eyes flicker - now i retain you..... to burn

You will burn

Plead for your life - i'm twisting your soul
scream to me why? but i do not know
my sould plagued with torment - for i must obey
for ending your life - i assume no control..... to burn

You will burn
