You close your eyes - do you feel the same
a floating world - exists no fear no shame
reality - a term that bears no meaning
you spread your wings  - to soar across the sky

You need the mind to slip away
to make it through another day

Losing yourself - within yourself
a promise made - for those who believe

A sudden turn - now journey into past
to see the child - an innocent reflection
you say the words - but no hears the meaning
mirror's reflection - can't you hear me screaming?

You need the mind to slip away
to make it through another day

Losing yourself - within yourself
a promise made - for those who believe

The world is ripped away - a light appearing
you try to fly again - yet you were dreaming

You need the mind to slip away
to make it through another day

Losing yourself - within yourself
a promise made - for those who believe

For those who believe
