Time after time - we forge to find the reason
to remain - the eloquence of sounds hinder the pain
lie after lie - retaining  what was once the auburn sky
as our world begins to fade.....

We know the end is coming near
in this prelude into fear

Relive the past - through memories of hope
cannot regain - oppressor - he has risen to retain
now overthrown - relinquishing to those whoe bear no shame
now it is he who reigns

We know the end is coming near
in this prelude into fear

Look to the eyes of black - the plead - be free again
but now through their attack - we pay for their sins

As we fear  - indefinite corruption
mortal decay - choosing to resist engulfs the pain
as skies turn grey - what once a world of hope is now enslaved
the nightmare has begun.....

We know the end is coming near
in this prelude into fear
