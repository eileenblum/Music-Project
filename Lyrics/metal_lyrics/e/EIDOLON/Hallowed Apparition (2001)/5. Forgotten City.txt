Explore an ancient sea - a journey through the unforseen
the legend told - can we believe
a city under siege - submerged by endless seas
could this be all but not a dream?

Will they return to tell the tale?
Or like the ones before who have failed

Radar detection clear - discovery is near
through sun - light rays - the visions cast
diving to the depths below - but who are they to know
tranquility - a dangerous past

Will they return to tell the tale
Or like the ones before who have failed

Beyond the rustic gate - consumed in horror - it's too late
sourrended by the ones who dwell
you chose to venture - now you must burn
forever lost in this forgotten world of pain

Will they return to tell the tale?
Or like the ones before who have failed
