Immaculate conception - incalculable perception
defacing in it's purist form
denounce the deity - defraud society
relinquish all who won't conform

De-evolution

Pre-conceive the enemy - alleviate hypocrisy
the deity - to reign supreme
eliminate democracy - elegant formality
rid the world of human's being

Bow to the bringer of death
the ruler of life
glorifier of evil
condemn those who fail 
to see the way 
for i have risen again....

Face the one you fear - the descender of darkness
infesting impregnation - of human decay
your life is in his hands - to him you're all the same
your soul is thrown into the fire

De-evolution
