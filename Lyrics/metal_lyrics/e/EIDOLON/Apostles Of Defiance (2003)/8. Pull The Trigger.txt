[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Watching - as the rain keeps falling down
Waiting - for the pain to knock me down
Malign indifference - frothing at your peace and glory
The naked truth - fish-hooked in your halo-story

The grand illusion - will you take me to the life you've chosen?
When all else fails - will you follow me to mine??

Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger - and fail!

Doubled over - from the pain you've put me through
Misguided memories - I've suffered onto you
Preach your peace - a world of cold distrust
Inept in solitude - now wince in cold disgust

To keep me locked away - attempt's to no avail
Destruction of my soul - your life I now assail

Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger - and fail!

[Solo - Glen]

Compassionate state - is a grand mistake
I am fixed to you - my rage is blazing
You've captured me - at an-all time low
My heart in apt to release

To keep me locked away - attempt's to no avail
Destruction of my soul - your life I now assail
As lies fizzle away - true sickness revealed
My life will go on - your test has failed

Subjected to your deity
Now dejected from society
Detained in hypocrisy
As you pull the trigger - and fail!
