[Lyrics: S. Drover]

[Theme - Glen]

Born into fire - embellished into flames
Arise from fury - you are inept to refrain
Your chosen life - a life of death
You will conform - to the apostles realm

Apostles of defiance
In sequence you will burn

Stand before the monarch - in sequence to burn
absorbsion into hatred -for the next sadistic feast
Fondness for the flame - from the depths you seek
Denial nullified - bathe in the blood of serenity

Apostles of defiance
In sequence you will burn

Years of treachery and deceit
Amidst decay - your thirst to seek
The countless lives you've wasted
The defiant 1 - you breathe
Retina zero's in - your lifeline slips away
Apostles gift now clear  - eternal hellish world

Apostles of defiance
In sequence we will burn
Apostles of defiance
In sequence you will burn
