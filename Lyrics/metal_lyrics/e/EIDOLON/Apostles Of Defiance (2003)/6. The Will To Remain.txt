[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Triumph over adversity - a struggle to exist
The heart torn to pieces - to loose you must resist
A blank stare gazing - to a far away place
Memories of hope - have faded far away
Eyes now peeled on white-blinding stripe
Gaining speed - harnessing the paved black path

The will to remain - find the strength to carry on
Mobility remains - the only way now to cope

All faith is lost - to blame a god-less world?
Unbearable tragedies - is it too much to take?
Intense thoughts of piercing hate and guilt
What have I done to deserve so much pain?
Sporadic serenity - in mobile transit
Dim skies now fading - collapsing into painless sleep

The will to remain - find the strength to carry on
When all else fails - find the courage to push ahead

To focus on what lies ahead
The only way to the road of recovery

Heading through the storm - of mind and terrain
Shifting gears to seek - the rights of passage and serenity
Accepting the mission - to face alone
To capture a purpose-less grin
Nobody knows my true pain.............

Awakened to find a new sky - encompassed with serenity
The new day brings new hope - I focus on the roads to recovery
Determined to hold my head high - accepting my reality
Time passes by - retaining my strength - though questions unanswered - true 
will has remained

The will to remain - I've found the strength to carry on
When all else had failed - I found the courage to push ahead...........
