[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

[Theme - Glen]

Tormented mind - a weakened pagan
The tarnished halo - of dripping blood
Through unspeakable acts - 1 final shot at glory
The sickening truth shall never set you free!

Justified through the book of faith
Without remorse - may you burn in fire

Twisted morality
Twisted morality

5 now perished, does this bring you closer to god?
Now how can you be blamed?
The rebel angel - he is the 1 to blame
His forceful tactics - are now my saving grace

Justified through the book of faith
Without remorse - may you burn in fire

Twisted Morality
Twisted morality

[Solo]
[1st section - Andy, Glen]
[2nd section - Glen]

Justified through the book of faith
Without remorse - may you burn in fire

Twisted morality
Twisted morality

1 hand on the book - the other blocking gasping breathe
Beyond sickness - you are the 1 to blame
For this you need - to perish in the lake of fire!
Drawn and quartered - in blood-soaked ashes may you burn!
Twisted morality
Twisted morality
