[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Trapped beneath 1000 storms, volcanic ash is brimming to explode
Buried under walls of ice - dormant lava waits to singe the earth

Detection of seismic refrain's - to forecast the lava flood bane
Unleashing volcanic debris - destruction the world's never seen

Exploding to the velvet sky - magma's force ignites volcanic plight
40,000 feet above - ash plume rises while pyroclactic flows

Screaming and running there is no retreat
Pumice and ash flow 1200 degrees
Erupting below walls of ice to unveil
Ice / lava mixture to floods - no escape!

Buried in erupted waste, volcanic earth now has sealed its fate
Predictions from forgotten times - discarded into now - the world demise!

Detection of seismic refrain's - to forecast the lava flood bane
Unleashing volcanic debris - destruction the world's never seen
