[Music: S.Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Bleeding - the eyes of the dead
Mind led astray in a world filled with blood
Soul fueled by contempt
A feeble heart intertwined - love and hate
A splintered psyche - adrift with illusion
1 hand to the sky with 1 foot in the grave

Scream from within - you seek the purpose
Flushed with heat - ablaze with fury
Consume the soul - no recollection
The night is filled with screams

Sweating - now drenched with confusion
Awakened by light - unfamiliar surroundings
Fleeing - the heart crushed with grief
Eyes on the cross with a thirst for desire
Ill-fated now slipping away
The chalice now blood-soaked - I fight to regain

Scream from within - you seek the purpose
Flushed with heat - ablaze with fury
Consume the soul - no recollection
The night is filled with screams

[Solo - Glen]

Living in human decay
Within these walls - now complete disarray
Will you find? The last saving grace from a total disgrace
Atrocities captured in time
With blood on your hands - ill equipped to deny

Scream from within - you seek the purpose
Flushed with heat - ablaze with fury
Consume the soul - no recollection
The night is filled with screams
