[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Breathing - contained in your forsaken pit
Now freezing - from scaling these walls you create
Whipping - the chains on my forsaken back
Spinning your web in this blood-soaked attack
Pummeling forces - now I cant deny you
Electrical current's denying my chance to escape

Unbeatable force to destroy
Demoralization deployed

I enslave you - victimized
I engage you - traumatized
I engulf you - dehumanized
I enrage you - mortified

Retention formed - I suspend in your grip
From your retched disease I attempt my escape
Infrared vision - eyes pierce in the darkness
Escape is illusive - my mind now astray
Wallow in darkness - my screams are unheard
As I scratch to the surface - your chains now en-claw on my neck.........

Unbeatable force to destroy
Demoralization deployed

I enslave you - victimized
I engage you - traumatized
I engulf you - dehumanized
I enrage you - mortified

Choking suspended - now gasping for breath
Grasping the chains for an uncertain death
Eye-blinding light now appears from above
Resisting pain as I focus for ways to escape!
"You shall not ever escape"!
Within these walls contained - I focus to escape
Electric forces felt - avoided from the chains
Ripped into the air - now closer to your vile
Hidden razor punctures - the sickening flesh that holds my last escape!

[Solo - Glen]

Unbeatable force to destroy
Demoralization deployed

I enslave you - victimized
I engage you - traumatized
I engulf you - dehumanized
I enrage you - mortified
