[Music: S. Drover, G. Drover]
[Lyrics: S. Drover]

Checking the engines - all things are in place
Strapped down the countdown's begun
Lift-off in flames - smoke is filling the sky
Arrival to countdown is done
May god be with us - now splitting the sky
Launching our way into space

Many - failed to pass the test
Can't attain - illusive

Expanding horizons - a leap for mankind
Mission is set and in place
Drifting through masses of binary stars
Solar flares beaming with light
Radar detection - incredulous site
The black hole - approaching in space

Many - failed to pass the test
Can't attain - illusive

[Solo]
[1st section - Andy]
[2nd section - Glen]

Mission control has detected - encourage
To alter the plan - it's too late
Sucking our spacecraft in forbidden blackness
Components malfunction - now frayed
Losing all contact with mission control
1000 light years from home

Many failed to pass the test
The black hole - illusive
