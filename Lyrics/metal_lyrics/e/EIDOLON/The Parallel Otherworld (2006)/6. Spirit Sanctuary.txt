A place where no one sees
A place for spirits where they
miscourage their deeds
Spewing from the mouth of hell
And they all belong to the light

Spirit Sanctuary
Spirit Sanctuary

Foretold in ancient times
Crystal stars in limbo
Entering your dreams
Axis point of no return
Only way to escape the void

Spirit Sanctuary
Spirit Sanctuary

A place where evil takes its toll
Where your mind is your eye
A freezing void that is your soul
To the ending of eternity

And theyï¿½re praying for grace
To be lifted and born again
Hear their endless screams
The creator was the one who fell

As One you might return
Gathering more forces
For the crimson void
Slave for darkness all youï¿½ll ever be
Keeper of the Spirit Sanctuary
