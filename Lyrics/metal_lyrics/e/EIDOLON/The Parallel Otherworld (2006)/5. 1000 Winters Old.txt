From all elements i hail
Born within the cold
Forged out from the fire

I was born out from an icy metropolis
From the core of fire my idea was clear - betray The Son
Betray the Son
All sins of mankind is mine

[Chorus:]
Onwards I must prevail
For my heart is thousand winters old
Pure ancient entity
mankindï¿½s mind
Created all of me

Fallen out from the holy grace
Petrified and cast
To eternal fury

Terror ruled the land from that infernal moment
In all hearts the rule was my command so clear,
Despise the Ten Commandments
And so earth became my land

[Chorus]

And my name is Belial
And my name is Lucifer
Heed the call, winters waiting
Into flames, evil prevailing

SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA

In the blood and flesh of mortal ones existed
For some thousand years before Christianity
I never was
I never was
Oh, mankind invented me

[Chorus]
