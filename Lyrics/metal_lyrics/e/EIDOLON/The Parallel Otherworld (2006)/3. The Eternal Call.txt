We are One, united as forces
Indestructive and chosen to stay
Hear the cries of the angels that guide us
Crying out tonight

Universal code, a cosmic error
Our quest so divine
Marching out, gather your forces
Under blood red skies

[Chorus:]
Hear the chanting storm, hear the cries
Under flag we sail ï¿½ blood red skies
And our quest is hard - so divine
Silence with my anger, marching out

Since my birth my consciousness have been spinning around
Themes that are not of this world
Is there a possibility, my genetic code
Could differ from anyone else?
In my mind, I see pictures of a past
That never happened to me
Is my life a lie?
Magical, waiting for me

Visions came to me at night, in early stage
In fever and dreams they appeared
Behind a vast transparency
Floating images - a meaning so true hard to find
Like my birth had possessed me, and my goal
Was cracking an infinite code
Now I see it clear
Secrecy, of the chosen

In silent wonder, I fall
This is eternity, my call
In silent waiting, I fall
Onward we sail the seven seas

[Chorus]
