Traveling through a distance far
And protected by self-decision
Levitating in Godï¿½s creation
Sense the grace of it all

[Chorus:]
Save us from the terror that they bring
Arcturus no. 9
Sirens call, a warning chants in space
Arcturus no. 9

Ancient breed, universal creature
Drawing closer, infernal mind storm
Concentrate now, attack is approaching
Fast escape to my level

[Chorus]

Dimensional flight
Between the eyes of
The existence, called The Unknown
The subliminal Gods, holders of
The original universal force
Powers to decide
Ancient fathers of
Dimensional flight
I see the change in me
Father, save me from this transformation

Tranquilized, set the world on fire
Power mindfield, superior armor
As I burn down their last final forces
See Arcturus arise

[Chorus]
