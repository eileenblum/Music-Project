Silent Whisper, coldness
Freezing entity
Something from another world
Is in my room
ï¿½Where do you think all these shadows come fromï¿½

Coldness entering my room
Shadows from above

Waking up in a cold sweat
In the middle of the night
Tranquilized by the feeling
That someone is here
Paralyzed like stigmata
My only consciousness
Iï¿½m trapped inside

[Pre-Chorus:]
Approaching everlasting pain
Lost in endless wilderness
Caught between all worlds

[Chorus:]
Silently arise
Ghost world, spirits
Spirits paradise
Dawn is near, stay away
In the mirror see
Ghost World, spirits
There in Lunaï¿½s light
Beyond divine, they sacrifice

Messenger from the dark side
The presence is near
Temperature into minus
A freezing entity
So cold in haziness

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

See the reflections in the mirror
A peak into the world
That you may face one day
Insanity grows even stronger
Recalling images
Of all your hopes and dreams

Lost souls of these dimensions
Will never come to peace
Though by a ritual in silence
Divine interfere
Led into the graceness
To endless horizons
White sorcererï¿½s guidance

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
