Force of mind
Evil, Divine
Force of mind
Evil, Divine
Power force of mind
Rising stronger, so divine
To embrace the gate
And Be all your fate
Enter your fate
Enter your grace

So many years since I had my visions
Now theyï¿½re out of my control
So many years, broke my understanding deep
And embraced the essence of true life
Closer, closer, give it all back to me

Silence tell me and all the stories that I have
My past life fears had vanished
Lights appeared once again concentrated eyes

Eyes of time
Slowly reappearing

Force of mind
Evil Divine
Power force of mine
Only way to be set free
To embrace the grace

The right path had led me astray
Direct into the circle of life
Blackening shadows arise
All around my childhood memories
I gazed at the the sky
To see what was there for me
So we danced upon the starlit sky
And the stars fell from the sky

The force of mind
Evil Divine
A power force of the mind
I search the way
For Myself
Into the light I ride, escape

Orgy of silence
Conspiracy of peace
Only the sound
Of the cold northern breeze

Looking upon my past life
Evil behind
Termination of this I have
Facing all of the ghosts from
From my past
Suddenly I awake from the dead

Strong winds calling
Evil warning
Past life memories
Return to innocence
Sinless
