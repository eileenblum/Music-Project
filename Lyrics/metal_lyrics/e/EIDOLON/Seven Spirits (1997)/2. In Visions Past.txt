As I look into the mirror of life
I loath the reflections I see
Painting by numbers - robotic existence
A servant who is made to believe

Sunday's - Saint Vincent - since i was a child
Joyed to be blessed with such things
An alter boy aid-serving Father McKenzie
Like a puppet who dangles from strings

In visions past
Could not believe
That I could live another way

My God remains
If nothing's changed
Why don't I feel the same way
