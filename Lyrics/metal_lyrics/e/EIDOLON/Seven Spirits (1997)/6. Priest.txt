There's not a second in the day
When I don't see his face
Dorian - screaming to be saved
Since then my life has changed

Why must I be the one
Why can't I focus on my faith
I know I must be strong
But my mind still haunts me too

I've been there too and walked along His path
In past - my share of pain
A man of cloth - but I'm still flesh and blood
Desire still stinging me

I know I must be strong
But my mind still haunts me too
