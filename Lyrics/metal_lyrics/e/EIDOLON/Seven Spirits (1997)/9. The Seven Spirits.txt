Pity on me - will you take
As my soul sent to flight
Past the one's left denied
Never knowing
If he holds their message of plight
Holding their souls in contempt

Hearing ill-fated cries
Oceans of souls left untied
Are all but denied

Lord won't you please hear my cries
As I beg to be saved

Note - as I drink from the chalice
Preventing me falling from grace
redeeming my soul through confession
My hands to the sky
Imminence grise through possession
Though not knowing why

Seven spirits

Although my eyes even now
Cast a look of condemption
When what has happened to me
If you're given redemption
The sacred had had come forth
Through renewal of faith
Outcast unclean seven spirits
Leave mind with no trace

Seven spirits
