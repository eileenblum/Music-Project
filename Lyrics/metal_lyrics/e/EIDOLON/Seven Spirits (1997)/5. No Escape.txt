The other side - I've re-emerged
Nothing's the same
I owe it all to Sarah
For what she has brought to me
The pain I bring to you
My soul feels so alive
The seven spirits guidance
Keeps me satisfied

You can't hide - there's no escape from me
It's my right to live eternally

Corruption of the mind
I live my life unscathed
I have the will to kill
Your pain will set me free
Confession to my sins

My anguish is so unreal
Can't erase the blood
I long for the pain you feel

You can't hide - there's no escape from me
It's my right to live eternally

Hypocrisies unveiled
A small price to pay
The pain you will endure
I'm saved another day
Mindset - unholy
Leaves a sacrilegious scar
I have a new lease on life
But have I gone too far?

You can't hide - there's no escape from me
It's my right to live eternally
