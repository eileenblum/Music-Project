Encompassing your mind with hate
The struggle to break free
Transgressive visions - you can't negate
You'll be at one with me

The loathsome acts within your mind
Are eating away at your soul
Seven spirits taunting you
Feel like your losing control

Creating a path of destruction
Commanding vociferous writ
It takes a life to take a life
And you're the one to do it

Sacrilegious suicide
Losing the will to remain
How I long your suffering
Knowing you'll kill again

Creating a path of destruction
Commanding vociferous writ
