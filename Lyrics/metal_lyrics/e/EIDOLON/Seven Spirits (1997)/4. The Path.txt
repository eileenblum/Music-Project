Crawling through deserts of desperation
Losing touch with reality
Your God has failed - your quest, denied
My faith will set you free

I can help you find omnipotence
Put your trust in me
Take my hand - let me show you the way
As we drift through the lake of fire

Dorian - release your fear
I'll show you things that you have never seen
Let down your guard - through the path's unknown
My faith shall help you find that inner-peace
Become as one with the seven spirits
Your soul is cleansed through their eternal screams
