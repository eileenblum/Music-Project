So many questions
Since I was a child
Remain unanswered
No longer can I deny
Do not forsaken him
Or so they say
The rebel angel
Has fallen from God's grace

You see him
You fear him
He speaks by means of snake
With God's will
You must deny
The wickedness of man

Is this the answer?
Is this the way?
Those who do not obey
Will not be saved

Jehovah says that we
Must only worship him
He will not share his glory
With anyone - or anything

The silent denial

She saw me staring into the unknown
Before the cross, on bended knee
I was confused and so alone
A lost soul fighting to believe

I've realized religious hypocrisies
That's when I knew this faith was not for me

Dorian, I was once like you
Forever told there was no other way
For a small donation of green
We'll wash your sins away

I've realized religious hypocrisies
That's when I knew this faith was not for me

It's lunacy how some pray for greed
A crystallized illusion
If you even dare to question their acts
You're scorned for your intrusions

I've realized religious hypocrisies
That's when I knew his faith was not for me
