Bless me Father for I have sinned
I'm not quite sure where to begin
Until now, the truth untold
I need your help to cleans my soul
Struggling with my faith
Sarah promised Heaven's Gate
Euphoric wisdom in my grasp
Taking hand - I though Jehovah's path

Paralyzed by grand mistakes
Euphoria now - Hell to pay
A demon seed within my soul
My mind and will they now control
Seven Spirits haunting me
Try to refrain - I can't break free
Father, please refrain me from this pain

Lord, can't you see this pain I feel?
I know what I've done is wrong
I cannot cry - my eyes now fill with empty tears
Time won't erase the things I've done
