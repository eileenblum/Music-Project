Wrongly committed - will not be acquitted
My life has been turned inside out
What was heaven - has turned into hell
Left here to burn in this eight by eight cell

Repulsion

A fuel is ignited - thought dimly lighted
Six years have passed and still no one believes me
My mind is now filling with hate
Visions will not let me go until I hunt you down
Repulsion

My good behavior - is now my savior
Instilled with false hope - to live life in peace
Each breath I take - is one less you'll make
I've paid the price - you must pay yours
