Wake up screaming - yet was I dreaming?
The fear inside will not subside
A realization - this fascination?
Prediction has for her to die

If I can't speak within my dreams
She cannot hear my silent screams

I try to warn you - you won't believe me
What will it take to realize?
Though I'm informant - I write in torment
Planchette has foreseen your demisee

If I can't speak within my dreams
She cannot hear my silent screams

Drowning in darkness as you fade away
Screaming in silence - lifeless you lay
I pray for your spirit - to show me the way
(Don't leave me here alone)
A light shines around me
As you take my hand
Rising above ourselves - I don't understand
Believe in your dreams
To clear the path within yourself
(Believe)

She wakes up screaming - but was she dreaming?
A vision from the other side

If you believe within your dreams
You'll never fear your silent screams
