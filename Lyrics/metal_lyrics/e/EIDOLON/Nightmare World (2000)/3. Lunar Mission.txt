T minus 30 brings our focus into sight
The realization of a dream
Serene landscapes now engulfed by clouds of white
By flames of hope we launch to unsuspecting skies

Lunar mission
To find a new existence

Above the clouds we soar
Our mission holds no use for strife
Our faithful quest - in search of life
View a venera probe
Our destination now in sight
Is there existence
Beneath the stars eternal light

Lunar mission
To find a new beginning

Lunar mission
To find a new existence
Lunar mission
To find a new beginning
