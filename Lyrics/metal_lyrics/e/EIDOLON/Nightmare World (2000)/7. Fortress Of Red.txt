All pray - our hands to the sky
Your fortress denied
All slain - your turn to die - without knowing why

They still worship his grave
Though his soul can't be saved
Now the bloodshed begins

No hope - taken by force - they show no remorse
Cut throats - avenge his remains. It's your turn to pay

They still worship his grave
Though his soul can't be saved
Now the bloodshed begins

What have we done? We've lived his way - without disobey
What was a fortress now has ceased - complete disarray

All pay - existing no more - they've evened the score
Banished as our nation lay dead
In this fortress of red

They still worship his grave
Though his soul can't be saved
Now the bloodshed begins
