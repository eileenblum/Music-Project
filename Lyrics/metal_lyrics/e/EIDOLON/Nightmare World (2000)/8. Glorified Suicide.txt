A loophole in the system brings them to death's gate
As he observes his hands are clean
Twisted religion he shall reap the hands of fate
While he obtains his sum of green

Glorified Suicide

Words on a tombstone is a lucrative reward
Another patient is no more
First degree murder - this should be his just reward
To flip the switch - even the score

Glorified Suicide
