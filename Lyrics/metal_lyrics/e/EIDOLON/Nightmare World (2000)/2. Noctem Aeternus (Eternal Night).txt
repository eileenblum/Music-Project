My life is death and obsession
Rising in darkness I live for oppression
Your blood - is my true desire
As I draw near you my heart burns like fire

Nocturn aeturnus

Yearning for you to see
I'd tell you my name but you would never believe me
To watch you writhe in pain
I sample your neck - you will not be the same

Nocturn aeturnus

And now your soul is mine
Mind filled with ravage - a victim to find
Their blood - is what you desire
Find resurrection in eternal night
Their pain will leave you cleansed
For you now beginning - your victim's the end

Nocturn aeturnus
