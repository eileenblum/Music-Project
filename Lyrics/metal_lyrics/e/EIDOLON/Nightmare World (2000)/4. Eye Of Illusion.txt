The hope to live in a victimless world
Do you see through the eye of illusion
A constant battle to weather the storm
A state of pernicious confusion
Persistence values the will to achieve
The pressures of segregation

Resistance is fading away
Did it have to end this way

Communication - the fear of rejection
Reclusive action - you're fading away
Cannot distinguish what's right from what's wrong
Repressing feelings - your mind's not that strong
Premeditation for those who betrayed
Your judgment will not be denied

Resistance is fading away
Did it have to end this way

Can't you see - just how I feel
My hate towards you - is so unreal
Retribution - for all your sins
You segregate me - for who I am
For this I've conjured - a simple plan
A course of action - void of shame
Blood stained steel - will soon reveal
My twisted visions - the act of rage

Resistance is fading away
Did it have to end this way
