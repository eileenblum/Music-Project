Beyond the valley of desperation
Thought patterns for carnage have eclipsed
The lust for life
Constraint emotions burn deep inside
As new order laws exude conspiracies of silence

When decimation has unfurled
Can we escape this nightmare world

Tempestuous overlord - ruler of this ravage nation
Those who defy us are abolished from existence
Chained and shackled - Humility through indignation
Avoiding torture - the path of least resistance

When decimation has unfurled
Can we escape this nightmare world

Sanctum of peace - now a distant memory
Communist laws now prevent us all for safety
Ones who were grasping on to the threads of sanity
Have become a web within this world of nightmare

When decimation has unfurled
Can we escape this nightmare world
