For in their deluded deyes my trials of summoning the powers of the moon and frivolities with the earth haunted the very shadows they feared the most.
My flocks of skeletal avian fiends did swoop and take the children... picking at the very eyes and scratching with feverish dementia.

But the spells... drenched in my own failings of brandy, had become too powerful to control.
The Ballet of the rodents did swell in numbers to the morbid concerto, and my feet danced amongst them awash with opiates and the blackest of magic.
