Incantations lead to foul things from within the soil.
Giving birth to serpent roots of the trees to do my biddings
And play with such things I did, like memories of childhood frolicking in the vineyards chasing the vermin with stick and stone.
Only to return weeping into my mother arms with grazed knees and dripping rabbit skins.

But those days have now long since past...
