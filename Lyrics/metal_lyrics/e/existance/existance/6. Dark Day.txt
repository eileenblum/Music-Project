Since that day, I think what I did.
The regrets invade my head.
I want you beside me.
This day I lost my confidante.
She was for me my second mom.
God bless her...

My mind can't be free
Please forgive me.
To give me strength to carry on,
I've got to loose my tears,
I am without you since you're gone.

I feel empty since our parting,
I can't stand up without you
I need you, in my life.

I told you no, for my music,
And now I want you to see
How many sacrifices were paid.

My mind can't be free
Please forgive me.
To give me strength to carry on,
I've got to loose my tears,
I am without you since you're gone.

Why I left this Monday night?
Why I let you in your brain?
I thought you lied about your illness,
I wasn't worthy of your love
I'm sorry for the harm I've done,
I wanna be back, before this dark day

My mind can't be free
Please forgive me.
To give me strength to carry on,
I've got to loose my tears,
I am without you since you're gone.
