Prisoner of the eternal ice
I'm witness of your endless fight
I've seen a lot of blood flowed in my life
Too Many souls I need to hide

One day, my hour will come
When the last men hope is gone, I dream, I'm
dreaming to go
My dream is to go

I've seen many things from your side
Many things haunt me at night
And all corpses left on the battlefield
Come and gather around me

One day, my hour will come
When the last men hope is gone, I dream, I'm
dreaming to go
My dream is to go

Prisoner of the eternal ice
I'm witness of your endless fight
And all corpses left on the battlefield
Come and gather around me

One day, my hour will come
When the last men hope is gone, I dream, I'm
dreaming to go
My dream is to go...
