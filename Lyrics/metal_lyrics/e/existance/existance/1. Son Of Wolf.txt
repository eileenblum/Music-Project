In the daily darkness
I think of my future,
Their eyes are on me,
To see the son's picture.
I will follow his boldness
To get his power
And I'll cross with fury
All the countries' borders

Braver,
The wolf is a legend,
Bolder,
Who came from Heaven
Fighter,
He shows all its beauty,
Hunter,
To live in glory

When the sun is really gone,
Give me hope to carry on,
Follow his way to the throne.
I want to go beyond the wall,
Without the fear to fall,
I'm the son of the wolf

If my dream is my life,
The young wolf will be rising,
Ready to find his wife,
He won't fear the pan coming
But if my dream doesn't come,
My life will be aimless.
And I'll know the boredom,
And I'll lose my freedom.
