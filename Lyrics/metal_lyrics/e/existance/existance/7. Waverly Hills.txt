In 1982, Waverly Hills closed its doors
After decades of suffering, known in the world.
Many people died after being victims of lab test
Doc cut their in order to expand their lungs

Now there is no place for change
Now they come back for revenge.
Waverly Hills.

Today, this place is haunted, nobody can go there,
Without the fear of hearing really awful things.
During many years, the patients lived a nightmare
If you were sick here, you were sure to know the hell.

Now there is no place for change
Now they come back for revenge.

In room 502, nurses commited suicide,
If they caught the same disease as the patients.
They didn't want to know the same pains and
treatments,
Waverly Hills was a strange sanatorium.

Now there is no place for change
Now they come back for revenge,
