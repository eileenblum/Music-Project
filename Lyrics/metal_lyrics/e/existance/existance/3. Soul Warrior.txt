We call you, the enemy arrives,
Forget you fear, and go to fight.
You're a gladiator cheered by the crowd,
Your hurt and kill, for not to die.
You don't understand that death is a show,
And that people pay to see you fall.
The man is facing you, tears flowing from your
eyes,
He must die because he's on your road.

Every day you pray for not to die,
And never say goodbye.

Soul Warrior,
It will give you the strength to be hard as stone.
Warrior,
You must fight and win and never be outgrown.

In the arena, we feel the smell of blood
And in the sky, we see the dead.
The fight begins, you take your sword
A rain of blows feel on you.

Every day you pray for not to die,
And never say goodbye.
Every night, your dream of better life
Where you could leave your knife.

Soul Warrior,
It will give you the strength to be hard as stone.
Warrior,
You must fight and win and never be outgrown.

We heard a moan, you're hit in the arm.
You have less strength but more anger.
You strike his head, he falls to the ground,
His life is ended because of you.

Every day you pray for not to die,
And never say goodbye.

Soul Warrior,
It will give you the strength to be hard as stone.
Warrior,
You must fight and win and never be outgrown.
