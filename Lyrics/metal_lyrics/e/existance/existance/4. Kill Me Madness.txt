In the deepest darkness of the sea
An old divinity wait and dream.
A deadly town under the head of the ship
Only remains of a disturbed time

Kill me Madness
I have crossed this Deadly town
I have seen them pray for the faith
In this Church in the sea

I passed down the secret's guardian side
the servant's blood flow under my skin
I protect a God older than mortals men
and will be alive after them.

Kill me Madness
You have seen this deadly town
How many times is resting to you
You know how long is resting to you
Watch and you can see me to pray
In this church in the sea
