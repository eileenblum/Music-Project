Innocent, death is so close
The lie of men leads me to the gallows
They will leave a woman widow
And my son after the mortal blow

And when my head is down
It will be too late
But you'll remember this date
You killed an Innocent

At dawn, my life will be destroyed
Because my death arrives and I can't avoid
I hope to be the last to give his life and pay
For a murderer still free today

And when my head is down
It will be too late
But you'll remember this date
You killed an Innocent
