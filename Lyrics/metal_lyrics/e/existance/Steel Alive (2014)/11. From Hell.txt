[screams:] Judge me when you can, you still lost ?

A kidneyâs in my hands,
Whence comes this letter ? From Hell
The ripper hits again, like the thunder out of Hell
Oh oh oh
Girls, you canât work this night
Oh oh oh
Jack has you in his sights
Donât close your eyes, and never turn your back
Heâs watching you in the dark
This paper brings you death
Bloody letters scream : Â« From Hell Â»
I want to see his face, God, give me this right !
Please, help
Oh oh oh
Poor girls, Iâll make you brave
Oh oh oh
Your names are on your graves
Donât close your eyes, and never turn your back
Heâs watching you in the dark
Donât let him play with your heart

[Solo]

Five women in the town
Tasted the knife, right from Hell
How can I avoid the sound
Of pouring pain, Hell !
Oh oh oh
Girls, stay under the light
Oh oh oh
Jack has you in his sights
Donât close your eyes, and never turn your back
Heâs behind you in the dark
Dont let him play with your heart
Or you will soon fall apart !
