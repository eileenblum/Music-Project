Throwing our pain, throwing our rage
Straight in the face of the world

Breaking the rules

Only with heavy guitars
How does it feel â the plastic age,
Digital tunes bought and sold ?
Donât need the fools,
Donât need your dumb TV stars
Always - Keep steel alive
Always - And forever
If you feel lost, lost and alone
Time to destroy the high walls,
Come out and then
Donât be afraid anymore
There is the truth youâve never known,
There is a sense to it all,
Flame burns again
As strong as it was before
Always â Keep steel alive
Always â Play it loud !

[Solo]

Always â Keep steel alive
Always â Again and again
Always â And forever
