I walked down the streets
No idea in my mind
I just wanted to see
People run through the town
Then I raised my eyes
And I looked at my reflection
What should I do with my life ?
I had to answer this question
I think Iâve found my fate
I donât want to lose my chance
My veil of darkness clears away
(Get away) from this world where I canât breath
(And leave your soul to the devil)
(Get away) and unchain my lonely heart
(And leave your soul to Metal)
(Get away) because I donât find what I want
(And leave your soul to the devil)
(Get away) and remove my name from Earthâ¦
I never looked behind me
I keep my head straight
Never I let them deafen me
Iâm following my rules
I tell the man I have seen
Running down the streets
They should look at their reflections
And ask themselves major questions
I think Iâve found my fate
I donât want to lose my chance
I feel the fire in my heart
(Get away) from this world where I canât breath
(And leave your soul to the devil)
(Get away) and unchain my lonely heart
(And leave your soul to Metal)
(Get away) because I donât find what I want
(And leave your soul to the devil)
(Get away) and remove my name from Earthâ¦
