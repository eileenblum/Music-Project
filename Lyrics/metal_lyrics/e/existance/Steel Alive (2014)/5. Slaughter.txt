Two common kids were looking for fame,
Happy and pleased with the hiding game,
Books in a mess, have spoke through the gun
And we all had nowhere to run
I believed in you God for so many days,
I believed but you were made into fear and pain
Firing at us till shoot guns felt light
Then suicide would set it all right
My old friendâs blood wet the dirty floor
What to do ? To hide at the door ?
I believed in you God for so many days,
I believed but you were made into fear and pain
Slaughter !
Slaughter !
The killerâs voice
Left us no choice
Behind these shelves we were not ourselves
Not anymore

[Solo]

Slaughter !
Slaughter !
The killerâs voice
Left us no choice
With death in view
Laughing at you
Killed by their anger,
We were in danger
I did not die in this pond
Of blood
