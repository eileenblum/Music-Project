In life they have fought
For Rockân Roll Gods,
Guitars were their blades
And tunes were their slaves
But life is like sand,
It slips through your hands,
Their days have gone by,
And silent they lie
But all their lives they were never in vain
And music flies over sorrow and pain
Legends never die
They rule the space and time
The fancies of Legends never die,
And stars begin to chime,
Heaven is on fire
Then donât ever cry,
Donât tell them goodbye,
Just be brave and strong,
Sing their mighty songs
But all their lives they were never in vain
And music flies over sorrow and pain

[Solo]

Legends never die
They rule the space and time,
The fancies of Legends never die
And stars begin to chime,
Heaven is on fire
