Lying on the floor
The viper is here I know !
I feel its venom in my veins
It takes my soul
I lose control
I has no mercy, it kills
Black Viper !
I canât move my head
âCause I feel the poison spread !
Its venom reaches my brain
I cry alone,
But my time is gone
I has no mercy, it kills
Black Viper !

[Solo]

Its venom reaches my brain
My life is gone
My death has come
It has no mercy, it kills,
Black Viper !
