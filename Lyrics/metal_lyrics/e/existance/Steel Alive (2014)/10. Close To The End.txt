One dark and gloomy morning
War said to me : Â« Leave home forever Â»
I canât deny this calling,
My dreams are turned into despair
Cruel fate, will you release me ?
Never ending roads,
Silence broken into pieces
All the world explodes
Look at the bombers flying,
Fury and pain are here forever,
Lost in the smoke of fighting,
We canât see home lights in our prayers
Listen to the scream of bullets,
Not to ancien odes,
No more lies and no more fooling
Everything explodes
Eighteen but lifeâs close to the end
Ooohhh Oohhh Ohh / Life is close to the end
Ooohhh Oohh / Life is close to the end
My mad heart is trapped inside me
Like a hunted beast,
If itâs death â I take it smiling,
And my days explode !

[Solo]

Death is dancing on the whole ground
Hurricane wind blows,
And I yearn to see the red sun
Before it explodes
Eighteen but lifeâs close to the end
Ooohhh Oohhh Ohh / Life is close to the end
Ooohhh Oohh / Life is close to the end
I canât change this evil world,
Keep the faith is just my only way !
