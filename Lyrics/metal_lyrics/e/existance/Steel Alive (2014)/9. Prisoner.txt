Tears flow from my eyes,
When I wake up in this world.
Only in my dreams I can live this awful cage
Nobody makes the rules,
Nobody owns my life,
I am the only one to choose what is right or wrong for me.
When I see the moonlight
It erases all my pains,
Iâm not a prisoner of the world.
After midnight,
Iâm ready to break my chains,
Iâm not prisoner of the world.
I ainât see the glaring light,
For many frightful days,
Iâm stuck life like a spider imprisoned in a jar.
Like a stranger in the night
Like a loser in a fight
Sorry but I leave you for a better world to me.
âCause when I see the moonlight,
It erases all my pains,
Iâm not a prisoner of the world.
After midnight,
Iâm ready to break my chains,
Iâm not a prisoner of the world.

[Solo]

Since midnight,
Iâve become a different man,
Far from the cries that Iâve heard.
I see the light of hope
In spite of the smoke
But not Prisoner of the world !
Prisoner of the world
Prisoner of the world
