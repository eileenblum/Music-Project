Walking through the darkness
Swallowing your pain
Caught in loneliness
Do you hear the temptress,
Singing Ode to death ?
I canât break the spell
Sorceress of shadows
You look like a wolf
Make your own laws
Let me feel the sweetness
Of your leather dress
Where you hide your blade
Roaming the streets when the night falls over the world
Sometimes Evil crosses your way to come back home
Sheâs not a whore but just a snake in sinnersâ clothes
The Sirenâs love has poisoned meâ¦ changed my soul.

[Solo]

I undress you, princess
Kiss you on the neck
Whatâs the price to pay ?
In a vicious circle
No way to return
Dying for a girl
Roaming the streets when the night falls over the world
Sometimes Evil crosses your way to come back home
Sheâs not a whore but just a snake in sinnersâ clothes
The Sirenâs love has poisoned meâ¦ changed my soul.
