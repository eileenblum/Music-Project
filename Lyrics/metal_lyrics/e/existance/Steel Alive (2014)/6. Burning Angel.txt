Inside my crystal ball
I see again a whole new world
Eve sleeping till daybreak,
Donât wake her up the tempter snake
The investigator says,
Â« I will reveal the hidden ways,
Taste my forbidden fruit
And your strange visions will come true Â»
Angel in robes of silk
Cries, Â« Donât you drink the cup of sin,
Donât feel the Devilâs claws,
In human minds heâll put his law Â»
Â« Angel, itâ far too late,
I am the Devil you betrayed,
And I shall make you pay,
I want your wings to burn away Â»
Burning Angel
Your everlasting fight
For human nature
Continues in the sky
Burning Angel
The wind turns into fire
Exterminated
Youâll fall but never die

[Solo]

Burning Angel
Your everlasting fight
For human nature
Continues in the sky
Burning Angel
The wind turns into fire
Exterminated
Youâll fall but never die
