Cut out from the signal left hanging in darkness
You're dark sadistic ride, open for everybody

Clear away any doubt you hold of me, wash away your tainted slate
Stand your ground, accept your fate, face the end, wash away your tainted slate

Shut my eyes to keep it in but I can't take much more
Tempted in to embrace the sin and speak all those forbidden words

There will be bloodshed, behold
And my reign of hate is pouring down

No reason, no discipline, no pretense
Destruction enveloping all that sacred
All ties all thoughts all lies are broken now my hate is
Your mind will lapse mental collapse at your life's end

Cut out from the signal left hanging in darkness
You're dark sadistic ride, open for everybody

Clear away any doubt you hold of me, wash away your tainted slate
Stand your ground, accept your fate, face the end, wash away your tainted slate

There will be bloodshed, behold
And my reign of hate is pouring down

No reason, no discipline, no pretense
Destruction enveloping all that sacred
All ties all thoughts all lies are broken now my hate is
Your mind will lapse mental collapse at your life's end

Open up your eyes so you can see, all that ever was and is to be
A broken reflection, a memory of time, a lamb to the slaughter now go stand in line

Walk away from this break away from this tear away from this, crawl away from this
From this wretched hole

I care not for your life force, I will drain it from your soul
A dark void left in my eyes, the bitter taste of failure left by your demise.

Speak forbidden words

There will be bloodshed, behold
And my reign of hate is pouring down

There will be bloodshed, behold
