Rotating wheels of fortune deciding roads of fate
Humanities destruction set on self aimed point blank

Run away
You're safe for another day
Kill to save

The lies in minds of those who seek to find the light of hope through eyes
Blinded by war torn times

Run away
You're safe for another day
Kill to save

Now watch the children dancing in flames of liberty
Can you see their charcoal faces, breathe the ashes of the free

Breathe

Run away
You're safe for another day
Kill to save

Your cause is less then worthy your actions far from grace
Holy fire from the saviors taking lead with force and crying

Save

Run away
You're safe for another day
Disarray
