You're turning pale now, life is crawling out of you. But your lies and deceit will follow. Your judgment's now. Your light is about to fade, you have reached the end this way, you brought this upon yourself, you're to blame and no one else! And time will record your verses,
you will cry them to your martyr, your martyr. Hear the cries burning in your soul. Now see the faces staring at you now. Now speak your plea to the crying hordes. Now feel, your light is about to fade, you have reached the end this way, you brought this upon yourself, you're
to blame and no one else! And time will record your verses, you will cry them to your martyr, your martyr.
