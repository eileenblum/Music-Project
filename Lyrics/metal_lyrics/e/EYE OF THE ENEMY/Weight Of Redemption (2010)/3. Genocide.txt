Sowing the seeds of deceit and destruction
Blinding the privileged eyes from this uncaring and callous

World-wide genocide

A world where life means less than your ideals, hate, consummate

Keep the lie and the flag half mast
Bide your time while the world is distracted

Paint your colours into the ground
While thousands are dying no one hears a sound

Pray for them all

Take their lives
Hold the line
Genocide

End of life
Hammer and scythe

Burning your way through bullets and blackened bone
Ponder in desperate silence when this broken road felt more home

World-wide
Eyes are blind
A world where life means less than your ideals

Execution of an aesthetic solace, greed fuels mans intentions
Nothing based on morals

Pouring down on me the evil you've set free
Tearing slashing till there's fucking nothing left of me

Push forward, stack corpses try to justify your homicide

Push forward, rain death upon us, let the world see the blood stains on
Your hands bitch

On your hands

End of life
Hammer and scythe

Driving, your flag through the hearts of the fallen ones
Living off those who die, fueling the rage and the view of my

World-wide genocide
A world where I refuse to be

World-wide genocide
A world where life means less than your ideals to me
