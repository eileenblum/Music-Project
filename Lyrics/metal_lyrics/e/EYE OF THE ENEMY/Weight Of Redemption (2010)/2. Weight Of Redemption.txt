Let this be known

Step back and look at the horror I've known
The weight of redemption spilled over will show

No penance to save a non caring soul
Trapped in the void of lost taking its toll

Fading words that play again in my mind
Calling out for what they will never find

A sense of knowing, a sense of the scale
A sense of release in the eyes of betrayal

Discover the light in me
Dimmed in the heart of us all

Don't fuck with our fight, this is our given right
Don't fuck with our fight

Into the bleak forever
Take part in this twisted game
Move forward a space, then take two away
Now stay in your place

Destructor of the human race
You are the slayer of the saving grace
The pied piper in the scope of a sniper
The battle is won but the wars just begun now
A great shining light
A steak through the heart
A strobe of insight
A reflex of hate will liberate
A bloody end to a rising mistake

Discover the light in me
Dimmed in the heart of us all
Redemption is mine tonight
Bring me back to the light

Into the bleak forever
Take part in this twisted game

Don't fuck with our fight, this is our given right
