Take my life out of your major plan
I'll not be a part of your scam

Hey you're all

Twisted lying condescending hating murderers
Fuel the fire, fill your pockets make a profit

Hey unfurl

I'll take my fate and go my way
To where these places call me
I'll never return

Shit
Look at the ants march for a false cause
There lives don't mean dick to their laws

Hey unfurl

I'll take my fate and go my way
To where these places call me
They'll never return

I'll take my fate and go my way
To where these places call me
Souls lost lies no more

Cut loose the ties that bind you to sovereignty
Witness the day of new rebirth
Cast the rock of the restless crowd
The cries of the masses rings brutally loud
We'll seize the day and a lifetime of pain
Will crumble before us

Now it crumbles.
