You piece of shit, I've had enough
And I'm giving up on any hope I had of thinking you would wake the fuck up
From this pathetic shit that you call image, how shallow do you go

This is war
It's getting stronger, the rising feeling, break through the fire

Every waking word I laugh at how I've heard you cry it to the ones who've always got you burned

Fuck you, you self serving hypocrite, seen it all before and it makes me sick, sick.
Send in the clone's one by one, hate to say bitch ass it's been done.

This is not my will or reason, give into selfish ways blinded by my indecision of myself and my desperate ways

Pray for murder, paving the way for murder, our souls decay for murder, paving the way for murder, our souls decay for murder

Pray for murder, paving the way for murder, our souls decay for murder until the end had come for all

It's getting stronger, the rising feeling, break through the fire

Every waking word I laugh at how I've heard you cry it to the ones who've always got you burned

Fuck you, you self serving hypocrite, seen it all before and it makes me sick, sick.
Send in the clone's one by one, hate to say bitch ass it's been done.

It's been fucking done
