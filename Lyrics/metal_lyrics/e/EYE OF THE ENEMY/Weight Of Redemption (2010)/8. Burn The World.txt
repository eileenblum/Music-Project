The house of cards falls down now
They see the light
Divide your mind and look inside you're
Hollowed out and left with nothing

Disease, inside our hearts and I know
I know

Ashes raining from the sky
The end approaching as we cry
Light the torch and pass the flame
Burn the world and start again

We'll burn the world and start again

Take a look at your world
And see the damage that we've done
Irresponsible race of destruction
War, famine a common daily conundrum

How can we end this fight against
Ourselves if we don't take the step
All forced to live under the ashes
Of our own machines

No more time wasting procrastinating, time is running out
No more time wasting dissipating, count the timer down

Now you see, take from me
Everything you ever loved will be gone
This holocaust won't take too long

We'll burn the world and start again

This is your time to make things right and
Give back what was never yours

No more time wasting procrastinating, time is running out
No more time wasting dissipating, count the timer down.
