Now
The fires burn my eyes
Charred holes that cannot see

Lost visions of my lifetime
Now hold false to me

Recount these memories
See you shatter what's close to me

I'd live the lie for no-one
False eternity

Now the scopes aimed
At your head

Your shit laid out for the world to see

Lied your way into this
Choke on the flames

The blind can't lead the blind forever
Death march through the endless maze
A march we've all been forced to take

The blind can't lead the blind forever
Death march through the endless maze
They'll stand rotting here

Scream what I, will not hear
Throw the shit that I, will not adhere
Brought down, never again
Broke my chains and fled from here

Hate
Takes hard control of me
Broke the shell and plant the seed

Roots dig into the core
Draining all it can from me

Bring my down upon my knees
Take my essence as you please

Take your fill and move along
To the next blood battery

Now the scopes aimed
At your head

Shit laid out for the world to see

Lied your way into this
Choke on the flames

The blind can't lead the blind forever
Death march through the endless maze
A march we've all been forced to take

The blind can't lead the blind forever
Death march through the endless maze
They'll stand rotting here

Count the days
And selfish ways
The beasts be praised
Your life it taken away

Now the scopes aimed
At your head

Your shit laid out for the world to see

Lied your way into this
Choke on the flames

The blind can't lead the blind forever
Death march through the endless maze
A march we've all been forced to take

The blind can't lead the blind forever
Death march through the endless maze
They'll stand rotting here
