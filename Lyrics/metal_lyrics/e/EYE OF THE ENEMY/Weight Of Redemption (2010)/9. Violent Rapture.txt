The hate inside of me rising
Anger starts to take control
Spit all the shit out from your mouth
Give me a reason to break down
All the walls of my calmness
Lash out and onrush regardless
Act on these senses of loathing
Make justice my own actions

Bleed for me

Die for me

You will see
My hate will set you free

And now the evidence will show
Of all my unleashed aggression
Swarm out grab your fucking face
Slam it into my red fist
Blood running down into my hands
Laughing as loud as I can
Squeeze hard until your eyes turn cold
Tear your god damn heart out

Bleed for me

Die for me

You will see
My hate will set you free

Into the depths of madness
I fall from sanity's peak
Descending with an open smile
No remorse
No defeat

Inside my head gets louder
The screaming to bring pain to those
Who wake within this feeling
Through my veins
To my soul

I won't hold back these demons clawing outwards
Take over me with a will to devour
Set on the stone your blood will run this night
End of your world you could not win this fight

Bleed for me

Die for me

You will see
My hate will set you free
