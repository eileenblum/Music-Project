Into the vestibule with nothing but my pride
left in the empty isles where shadows cannot hide

Inherent doubts and fears no longer at my side
my body swept of filth and cleansed now in the tide

We are the end to come
to all that has begun
say goodbye to the setting sun
one for all and all for none

Now wipe the blood away that covers up your face
behold the prophets in illuminated grace

Hands raids towards the tower high above the storm
struck down the righteous few blessed to be reborn

The march of the damned, burns through the turf
no longer salvation but melting the earth

Waking disaster, that hides in your faith
no longer salvation that's left in it's wake

All hail the king of kings, saviour of the herd
fire dripping from his lips and ice forms on his words

The heavens open wide and swallow up the sun
arms wide in loving praise the damage has been done

We are the end to come
to all that has begun
say goodbye to the setting sun
one for all and all for none.
