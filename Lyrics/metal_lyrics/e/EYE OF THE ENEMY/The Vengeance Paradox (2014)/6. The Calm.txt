Veer away from the souls decay, a rotting hole born of dismay
trust burns and your own you betray, a life, lived, lost

A life lived lost

Now based on the sins of the father
duly passed onto the son
no more mistakes in my honour
the damage is done

A beast is born from regret
forged through the passage of time
the fate of the world have been reset
and chaos becomes my kind.

Tainted eyes, roll back to see inside
what's kept within this hollow lie

Lessons have changed, a plan re-arranged
And no one to hold on the line

This will bury you in time

I wonât fade to nothing

I wonât fade away

Too proud to just fade away

A life, lived, lost

Look at your fucking self

Veered away from what I know, what's left today tomorrow we owe
veered away from what I know, what's left today tomorrow we owe

You can't fight

Veer away, life force in decay.
