No excuses left
to justify your theft now

The dead memories lingering longer fueled by regret

Lies lay beside, the excuses in your eyes
rage gives way to violence, and damns you for all time

No, more, see, what you, have done.

You're no hope at all

A dangerous field
left barren of life that you steal

I won't let your kind get away
vices will mount in the end you must pay

Lies lay beside, the excuses in your eyes
rage gives way to violence, and damns you for all time
No, more, see, what you've, done

Left alone at night with terror in your eyes
stuck within the rage
left alone at night no end at all in sight
accepting a life in a cage

Coward in life, living mistake, left you with nothing but shaming and waste

No, more, see, what you've, become

Left alone at night with terror in your eyes
the wolves with which you've laid
left alone at night no end at all in sight
bare teeth in the bed they have made.

Left alone at night disaster in your eyes
lost within the strain
left alone at night no more time to bide
accepting a life filled with hate.
