Promises made an oath sworn with pride
never to stray far from your side
I'll never stray far from your side

As the days grew longer, nothing much mattered to me
resentment was lead in the endless display

Shoulders where held down, the weight of the world as my crown
self-inflected apathy

I'd never seen a day
when life depends on me

Careless aggression gave way to obsession

I'd bow my head in loss, for a moment in time now lost
and I still await that old hour

Little one, innocent son
I swear I will always be here

No more waste in regret
accept the fate we have met

Begin again

Move away from the hate, fear, loss, bitterness
see through the haze rage fuels best

A lesson of mine, will be yours in time
how you prepare the duty is mine

I'll pave the way for you

Pave our way for you

And father I'll bury my anguish with you

Loss, nought to replace

Loss

Our time was short to most
but I've never felt as close
and I still await that old hour

Little one, innocent son
I swear I will always be here

What's now begun, won't be undone.
