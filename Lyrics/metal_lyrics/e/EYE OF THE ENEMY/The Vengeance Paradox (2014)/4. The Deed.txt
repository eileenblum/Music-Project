Stuck on the thought of regret
another day has come and gone

Lost out on another event
all in all is another gone

Broke my vow of silence today, I swore I'd never tell another soul
but beauty bested the beast in me and now I'm screaming in another hole

All that I had left, has been forsaken
all that I held best, has been left wasted

Eye for an eye
stand by and watch the world go blind
a dead pool of never ending pain is what you'll find

A lost tome written by the hand
that guides the spear through the heart of the earth

Foolish words spewing out of the mouth
with no intention, valour or worth

No, you are not safe from me

Now you'll be in debt to me forever
begging, keep you under lock and key

Watching as your light goes out for me

Bathe in your light as it fades
laugh as your life drains away

Now you'll be in debt to me forever
begging, keep you under lock and key

Now you'll be in debt to me forever
watching as your light goes out for me.
