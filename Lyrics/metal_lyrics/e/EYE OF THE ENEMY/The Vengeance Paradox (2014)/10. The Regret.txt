Step out of the mould, look at yourself
realise you're not who you thought and no one could tell

Now whittle away all the pieces, till everything that matters is gone
mind hanging from a thread, what feels so good can't be wrong

Walk the plains of existence, see there's nothing left for us
hollow structures give into weight, straw used as bricks fool now it's too late

The missing pieces wonât fall into place
the fount of contempt flows, now come have your taste.

Tried to abide all of your lies
to my face you hid poison thorns in sweetened disguise

Now whittle away all the pieces, till everything that matters is gone
mind hanging from a thread, what feels so good can't be wrong

Given everything heart, soul, mind and skin
dedicate to the cause

Lost my way again, now this is my sin
doomed to live what is left, with the thought

With the thought

Step out of the mould, look at yourself
realise you're not who you thought, and we all could tell

Now whittle away all the pieces, till everything that matters is gone
mind hanging from a thread, what feels so good can't be wrong.
