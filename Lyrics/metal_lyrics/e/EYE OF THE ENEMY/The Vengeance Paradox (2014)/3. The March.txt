Lay down your arms to me
bare your throat for the sweet release

I will drain your life
tempered sacrifice

Now bow down for your honour
swear your devotion unto me
no more self-desire
live your life, then give it all to me

Now the blind shall see
as they draw their final breath
take your sins and walk away

March

Hands bound in gracious silence
a willing tool no need for violence

I will turn the knife
pain will not suffice

Now bow down for your honour
swear your devotion unto me
no more self-desire
live your life, and give it all to me

Now the blind shall see
as they draw their final breath
take your sins and walk away

March

All through the hollow you will follow me with pride
no doubt or hesitation, love will fill your eyes

No second guessing no doubts lay in your way
I am all knowing and to me you should give praise

I am the coming of the age you wished you've known
I'll swallow everything reaping what you've sewn

I'll spare you nothing smile and make my way
leave you in the dust telling yourself you'll be OK

I'll spare you nothing smile and make my way
I am all knowing and to me you shall give praise.
