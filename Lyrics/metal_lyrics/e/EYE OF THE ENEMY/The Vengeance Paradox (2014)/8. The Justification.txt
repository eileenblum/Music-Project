Light another candle, throw it in my eyes
another act of fallacy hidden behind your smile

Like it's all the same, heard it all before
take away your crutch now you're knocking on death's door

No account for apathy, given it away
shut my ears to all your shit, wonât listen to what you say

No more lies, or games to call
your reason makes no sense at all

See all, end all, be all
and now you'll watch as I fall
no more empty pages
courses ran for ages into the wall

While you waste away, I'll beg for more

Twisted voices in my mind, whisper where to find
a hatred growing deep inside, and how to make it mine

Becoming the see all, end all, be all
and now you'll watch as I fall
no more empty pages
courses ran for ages into the wall

No more lies, or games to call, your reason makes no sense at all.

While you waste away, I'll beg for more

Becoming the see all, end all, be all
and now you'll watch as I fall
no more empty pages
courses ran for ages into the wall.
