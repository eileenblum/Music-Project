Piss again all over your protest
another log added onto the fire

Give away your position in solace
to a role with no thanks or desire

A dark sight to behold
a cruel tale untold

A wretched growth in its place
to poison yourself with mistakes
Ends tied will only loosen in time
A hollow reflection forebodes you and I

No resolution in false restitution, betrayal in its place

I wonât bow or bend will to anybody
this cage canât hold onto me
I wonât break or bend my will to any of this
darkness that is calling to me

The darkness is calling to me

I will take this
cold embracing
feel its shaping
changing me in eternal bliss

It shapes me in eternal bliss

On through the darkness a lost hope is found
in silence no longer the mute make a sound
break through the horror from which we were born
we'll burn through the ashes and break the old dawn

Marching ever forward to determined to look back
kicking up our hallowed ground press harder till it cracks

Marching ever forward to empowered to look back
the battle lines are drawn and in the end Iâll take it back

Marching ever forward too relentless to look back
weapons drawn in strength and number press for the attack

I wonât bow or bend will to anybody
this cage canât hold onto me
I wonât break or bend my will to any of this
darkness that is calling to me

On through the darkness a light has been found
in silence no longer the mute now make a sound.
