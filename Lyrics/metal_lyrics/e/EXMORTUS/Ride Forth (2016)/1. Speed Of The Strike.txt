Riding forth through lands forlorn
Upon our steel the oath is sworn
Dare to make your final stand
Nothing can our steel withstand
Fate is sealed
Death by steel
Slaying man and god alike
All shall feel the speed of the strike

Hark! The Sound of steel
The mighty roar or clashing swords, the battlefield
Lo! the metal storm
Forthcoming bane
Those who remain all shall be torn to shreds
Swords stained red
Raze to the ground
We will strike you down

Scream aloud your battlecry
Show no mercy for the end is nigh
Iron warriors of the night
Show them all our metal might
Fate is sealed
Death by steel
Slaying man and god alike
All shall feel the speed of the strike

Hark! the sound of steel
The mighty roar of clashing swords, the battlefield
Lo! the metal storm
Forthcoming bane
Those who remain all shall be torn to shreds
Swords stained red
Raze to the ground
We will strike you down

Horns blare out the final call
Retribution, thy kingdom fall
Worship not the gods on high King or serf
All men must die
Fate is sealed
Death by steel
Slaying man and god alike
All shall feel the speed of the strike

Hark! the sound of steel
The mighty roar of clashing swords, the battlefield
Lo! the metal storm
Forthcoming bane
Those who remain all shall be torn to shreds
Swords stained red
Raze to the ground
We will strike you down
