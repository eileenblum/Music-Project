Haunting the wastelands accursed spirits reside
Warriors of shadow shouting unholy war cries
Burning with hatred they lie
Cursing the living, all shall die

Roaming the dark depths, below the black is no end
Waiting for Death to bear us on black wings, ascend
Vengeance is calling, condemn
Evil, the dead shall rise again

Darkness calling, death hath summoned demons free of fate
'Neath the Earth the voices chant
Their haunting hymn of hate
Souls unleashed now pouring forth from Hades' iron gates
From the grave the dead march out
And chant their hymn of hate

Darkness shall rise
Thunder and might
Onward we ride
Steeds of the night
Shall ride forth
Relentless force
Mortal fate
Resonate
The hymn of hate

In the darkest night
Surrounding blight
Incite to rise

Forever cursed to the dark in which they abound
Bear witness to the chorus of hatred resound
Deathless, these black knights of yore
Screaming, they're marching out to war

Darkness shall arise
Unforeseen demise
Imminent annihilation
Suffer eternal damnation

Darkness calling
Death hath summoned demons free of fate
'Neath the Earth the voices
Chant their haunting hymn of hate
Souls unleashed
Now pouring forth from Hades' iron gates
From the grave the death march out
And chant their hymn of hate

Darkness shall rise
Thunder and might
Onward we ride
Steeds of the night
Shall ride forth
Relentless force
Mortal fate
Resonate
The hymn of hate
