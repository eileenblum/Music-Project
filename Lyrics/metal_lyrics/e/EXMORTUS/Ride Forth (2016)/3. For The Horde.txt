Ride on
Raise your sword and fight strong
All shall face the mighty metal horde

Thunder
We go in and plunder
Bow before the heavy hammer lord

Whiplash
Hackslash
All is burned to ash

Vengeance rides on wrathful wings
Agony and death we bring
Battlebound we raise our swords
For the horde

Thirst for blood cannot be quenched
Crimson rain, our steel is drenched
Victory, we raise our swords
For the horde

Steadfast
Necromantic spellcast
Fallen warriors rise up from the grave

Undead
Rivers running blood red
Sea of crimson
Feast of flesh they crave

Whiplash
Hackslash
All is burned to ash

Vengeance rides on wrathful wings
Agony and death we bring
Battlebound we raise our swords
For the horde

Thirst for blood cannot be quenched
Crimson rain, our steel is drenched
Victory, we raise our swords
For the horde

Whip
Crack
Bones will burn
Black scorching heat
Dust
Feral bloodlust

God's dethroned
Now flesh and bone
Now spill their blood
Drink of the flood

Unholy spell
Unleashed from hell
Raise up your swords
For the horde

Vengeance rides on wrathful wings
Agony and death we bring
Battlebound we raise our swords
For the horde

Thirst for blood cannot be quenched
Crimson rain, our steel is drenched
Victory, we raise our swords
For the horde

For the Horde!
