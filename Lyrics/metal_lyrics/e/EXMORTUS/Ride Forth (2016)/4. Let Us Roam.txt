Seeds of hate are sown
Tormented Tartarus unknown
Black chasm, we emerge form nothing
We are servants no longer
The earth we shall wander
The throne we shall conquer
Listen to our plea with darkness
Let us roam

From the depths we crawl
Unshackled, nevermore enthralled
Relentless, we are bound for glory
Bloodlust, insatiable hunger
The lands we shall plunder
All rent asunder

Relentless ire bursts forth like fire
We ride forth now conquering all
All we devour, 'tis dragons hour
Empires all sunder and fall

Seeds of hate are sown
Tormented Tartarus unknown
Black chasm, we emerge form nothing
We are servants no longer
The earth we shall wander
The throne we shall conquer
Listen to our plea with darkness
Let us roam

Let us roam, we have forsaken home
Let us roam to wander the unknown
Let us roam, we claim this Earth our own
Let us roam, Titans unleashed, let us roam
