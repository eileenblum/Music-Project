Fell tyrant's rule all over
Their tyranny must end
Make your stand against evil
For we are all free men

Death to tyrants
May their schemes be overthrown
Death to tyrants
May their blood drip from the throne

Lay siege to all their strongholds
Deliver them to death
Give them pain and agony
Until their final breath

Death to tyrants
May their schemes be overthrown
Death to tyrants
May their blood drip from the throne

Call to arms
Rise up, we ride to war
Conquest, tyrants shall rule no more

Now ride swift
Our hearts are filled with hate
Metal warriors assassinate

Fell tyrant's rule all over
Their tyranny must end
Make your stand against evil
For we are all free men

Death to tyrants
May their schemes be overthrown
Death to tyrants
May their blood drip from the throne
