Beyond the shores of forgotten home
Black abyss of gods unknown
In deepest trench of cosmic light
Roaring storm decide our plight
Flag is raised against the wind
Venture where dark and light begin
Upon the swells of the blackened seas
Cursed treasure, travesty

Amidst the fury of roaring falls
Grimmest death hymns his haunting call
