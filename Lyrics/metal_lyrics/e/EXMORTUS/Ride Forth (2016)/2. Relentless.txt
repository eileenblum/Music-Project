Ride on!

Crisis for liberty
Beyond memory
Suffer my hell
Death, misery

Tormenting spell
Unchained
Relentless we ride free

Now fear the coming storm
Repent, thy sacred flesh be torn
Tyrants of infamy
Meet your destiny

Suffer my hell
Death, misery

Tormenting spell
Unchained
Relentless we ride free

Brandish your swords up high
Dauntless and bold we face the endless hordes
Champions of war defy
Lo and behold we are slaves no more

Ride on!

Ride forth to victory
Immortal legacy
Suffer my hell
Death, misery

Tormenting spell
Unchained
Relentless we ride free

Brandish your swords up high
Dauntless and bold we face the endless hordes
Champions of war defy
Lo and behold we are slaves no more

Now fear the coming storm
Repent, thy sacred flesh be torn

Ride Forth

We face the endless hordes
Lo and behold we are slaves no more
