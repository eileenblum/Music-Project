Deep in darkness chaos reigned for aeons untold
Eternal of frost and flame, the cosmos unfolds
Deep within primordial cloud
The fire burns as frost bites
The yawning gulf's now roaring aloud
With the essence of fire and ice

In forge's fire of flaming wrath
The hammer hews to pave the path
For the breath of life, the tree of ash
Time is born

Icy blizzards, rain, destruction,
Firestorms, all form creation
Fire and ice
Behold fire and ice

The roaring seas and tempests of old
Are all forgotten lore
Riding forth all shall behold the triumphs of war

Bold heroes of greatest zeal
Are by dreams of glory enticed
All searching for the riddle of steel,
The secret of fire and ice

In forge's fire of flaming wrath
The hammer hews to pave the path
The rise of empires, armies clash
Time for war

Icy blizzards, rain, destruction,
Firestorms, all form creation
Fire and ice
Behold fire and ice

Deep in darkness tyrants reigned for ages untold
Eternal feud of frost and flame, the story unfolds
Great kings of boldest zeal all made their grim sacrifice
Ever they sought the riddle of steel
The power of fire and ice

In forge's fire of flaming wrath
The hammer's hewn and paved the path
The fall of empires, all is ash
Time no more

Icy blizzards, rain, destruction,
Firestorms, all form creation
Fire and ice
Behold fire and ice
