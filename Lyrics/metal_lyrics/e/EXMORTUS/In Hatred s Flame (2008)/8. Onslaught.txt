Rampage through the village
Slaughter all in sight
Decapitating one by one
There's bloodshed in the night

Kill
Engage in War
Your death awaits

Scatter through the fields
Hear nothing but our battle cry
Refuge in the darkness
Your weakest are the first to die

Unleash the onslaught
Unleash the onslaught

Chaos and destruction
We live to devastate
Can't escape our massacre
Your lives we'll terminate

Fight with savage fury
Stab your swords in deep
Eradicating all in sight
Their limbs are mine to keep

Kill
Engage in War
Your death awaits

Scatter through the fields
Hear nothing but our battle cry
Refuge in the darkness
Your weakest are the first to die

Unleash the onslaught
Unleash the onslaught

Chaos and destruction
We live to devastate
Can't escape our massacre
Your lives we'll terminate
