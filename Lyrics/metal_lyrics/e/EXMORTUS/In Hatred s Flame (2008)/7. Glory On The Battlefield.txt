Time the essence
Breathe unto me
The strength of our fathers
I hear in the winds
The call of my ancestors
Their voices echo for the chaos to end

So hear me now
Call for our freedom and honor
They may take our lives
But never will they strip us
Of our spirits as warriors

There now do I see my fathers
And their fathers before them
Great spirits let our story and our strength
Forever be burned in history
And if we fall may we meet in the great halls
Where the spirits of true warriors shall live on

Forever

The past
It flows through my veins
With the wrath of the ages
That brings pulse to my heart
The power and the might to
Stand forth and fight for freedom
So that one day our children will know peace

We will ride into battle
No fear shall eclipse our eyes
Death shall not be not be feared but fear us
The valleys will drink of our enemy's blood

Glory
Let them hear our battle cry
Glory

We will ride on
Through the night
Let them hear us
For our glory's sake
Stand up and fight for freedom and glory again
So that our stories are retold
And light up those midnight skies

Where do you find the right
To lay your weary head down and die
Rise till you take your last breath
And fight till your glorious end

Rise up take your last breath
Glory shall be ours
