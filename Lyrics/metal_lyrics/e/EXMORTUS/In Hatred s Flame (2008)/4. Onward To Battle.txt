For honor and pride
We will fight through frostbitten lands
Through frozen kingdoms we ride
On fields of battle and rivers of blood
Hear our cry
Onward we ride

In this place where its existence
Is questioned by an army's cry
Standing tall with sword at hand
Running forth beneath a blackening sky
Your fate in absolution
Feel the blood shed upon your eyes
Standing tall with shield at hand
And armies fall to your reckoning cry

Rise

Run forth into battle
Our eyes shall show no fear
Rise up with sword divine
In seas of maddening cries
Rise

Onward to battle we ride!

Our eyes shall see through darkness
Victory shall be our crown
We'll overcome all men
Against our hands be stricken down

Fighting through a wave of armor
Standing strong with head up high
We'll reign the land before you
You will repent
Before you die

Run forth in to battle
Our eyes shall show no fear
Rise up with sword divine
In seas of maddening cries
Rise

Onward to battle we ride!

In this place where its existence
Is questioned by an arm's cry
Standing tall with sword at hand
Running forth a blackening sky
Your fate in absolution
Feel the blood shed upon your eyes
Standing tall with shield at hand
An army falls to your reckoning cry

Remember our name
For we shall become one with the battlefield,
Onward we ride

Remember our name
For we shall not be forgotten
Onward we ride
