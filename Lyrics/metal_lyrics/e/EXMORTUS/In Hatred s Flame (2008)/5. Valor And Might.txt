Above an endless sea
Of swords and shields
Echo the winds of war
As battles spawn, empires fall
Tyrants destroy the land

Set ablaze,
Our city burns in ruin
Advance toward the land
We once called home

Waves of arrows
Black out crimson skies
And shatter mortal souls
Raze their mighty walls
To rebuild our once beloved home

Warriors clash and blood is spilled
Tens of thousands will die
Slay our enemies by dawn
Let the slaughter begin!

Tyrants will fall
To our scorching steel
We are, we are of valor and might
Obliterate oppressive bonds
That enslave our people
Rise up,
Reclaim what was once ours

We are, we are those
Of valor and might

Hear us O gods of valor
And gods of might
Grant us the strength
To vanquish
All those who oppose us

We are, we are those
...of valor and might
