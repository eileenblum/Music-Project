Frostbiting winds engulf the earth
Commencing the Fimbulwinter
Spirit of Evil unleashed
Gathering the hordes of darkness
All hope is lost

Spirits of the Grey Wolf swarm the land
The Sun and Moon grow pale with fear
The fate of the gods, Death is near
Ravenous beasts engulf the bringers of life
Consumed in Primeval Darkness

Rabid hounds of hell storm the gates
Annihilation of the weak
Limb from limb, the bodies tear
Blood drips from the devouring jaws

The Fimbulwinter draws near
Looming darkness consumes all
Titans rise to slay the gods
The beginning of the end draws near

Fimbulwinter!
Broken free from my icy prison
Chains no longer bind my soul
Fimbulwinter!
I gather armies from realms of fire and ice
Gods are now damned by my revenge
Fimbulwinter... Die!

Fate of the gods, death is near

The Fimbulwinter draws near
Looming darkness consumes all
Titans rise to slay the gods
The beginning of the end draws near

Rabid hounds of hell storm the gates
Annihilation of the weak
Limb from limb, the bodies tear
Blood drips from the devouring jaws
