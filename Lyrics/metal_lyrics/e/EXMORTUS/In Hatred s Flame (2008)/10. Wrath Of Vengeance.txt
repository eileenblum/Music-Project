Death comes bearing witness
My final breaths abandon me
My soul incinerated
Sucked into the realms of hellpyre

Demons of the underworld
Prepare my soul for glorious slaughter
Let my face be seen
Before you die
Before you die, vengeance shall be mine

Great spirits, show me mercy
And return to me my strength
Gods in great halls hear my plea
For just as the sun sets in the sky
Vengeance will be mine

Let thine enemies know my name
And fear it
And may power subdue their thoughts
For victory can be achieved
With great power and great might

Blood will spill,
By the end of my blade
My victims shall taste my steel
Advance through the lands, make haste like the wind
My vengeance shall be fulfilled

They've come to take my life
My final breaths abandon me
My soul incinerated
Cursed into the realms of hellpyre

Demons of the underworld
Prepare my soul for glorious slaughter
Before I die
Before you die
Vengeance will be mine!
