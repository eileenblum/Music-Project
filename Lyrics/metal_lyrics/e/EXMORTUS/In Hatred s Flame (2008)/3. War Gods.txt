Hail to the gods!

Across seas of fire
Burning valleys of death
The kings with enemy's sorrows,
Their kings that have wept
Their blood is laced
With the blood of kings
And the kingdoms they oppose
Hear our call
From the blackened skies
To the depths below

[Chorus:]
For we are the war gods
Raise up your axe of war
Kneel before us
And feel our wrath and scorn
For we are the war gods
Raise up your axe of war
Gather our legions
For we shall rise in the morn'

Bow to your gods!

Warriors
Gather your army,
For you've yet to fulfill
Your glorious dreams,
And stand there before us
Hear us now

[Chorus]

Die for your gods!
