Journey far through blizzard realms
Traversing grinding ice
On mighty sail take flight forth
To fight against frost blight
Thus human might
Shall be renewed and virtue
Reign supreme
Bear to all who which oppose the light
The oath shall not be broken

Frost shatters, hope adheres
With clashing steel upon great steel
Withstands all icy blows
Unless they pose a thralldom
Resistance shall carry on
Triumph by fire
Shall it be done?
