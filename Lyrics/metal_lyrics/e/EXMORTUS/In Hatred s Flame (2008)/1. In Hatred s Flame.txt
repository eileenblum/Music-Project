Born and sworn to rise above
To forever reign supreme
But the darkened heart that you posses
Will be consumed and only make you scream

Forever you will burn in hatreds flames
They shall torch your conscience
And forever know your name
I see you burn in hatreds flame
This "chosen" one shall lay an empty frame

To be renowned is the only thing you crave
You've  betrayed your fellow man
The brethren that got you to where you stand
And now it burns until that final day

You lose the war and fall upon your knees

Forever you will burn in hatreds flames
They shall torch your conscience
And forever know your name

And there you lie to burn forgotten and alone
To Realize that you shall never rise
Up off your selfishness and in your damned throne
For your betrayal you are plagued to burn

Forever you will burn in hatreds flames
They shall torch, burn conscience and forever know your name
I see you burn in hatreds flame
Forever I shall see you burn
...BURN!
