Essence from the burning bowl, opium
Infinity declines, face the truth
Echoes from a distant time, takes its toll
Waiting impending doom, hear its call

Gaze upon the tearing waves, crumbling earth
Bane forthcoming, see its birth
Welcome the fall of time, donât look down
Chaos ripping, end of life

Between false heavens and false earths
Chaos crawls devouring all
Let the fall begin

Donât look down
Donât look down

Vortex of cackling demons conjuring the fall of time
Sanctuary, does not exist, hope escapes my mind

Donât look down
Donât look down
Donât!

Assuring salvation towards the endless sky
My eyes wander downward I dared defy

Donât look down
Donât look down

Vortex of cackling demons conjuring the fall of time
