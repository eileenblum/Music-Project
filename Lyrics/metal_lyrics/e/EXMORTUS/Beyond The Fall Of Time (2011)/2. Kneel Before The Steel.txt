Stand your ground
Fear the mighty ones
You must obey

Hurricane of piercing death
Maelstrom eats terrain
Avalanching firestorm
Titans here to reign

Screaming metal
Molten blood
Kneel before them
Kneel before the steel

Slay the weak
Bring them to the ground
You must obey

Feel the steel rip the flesh
Thunder roams the sky
Bones are crushed and heartâs collapse

Bathed in blood you die
You die

Rising shadows
Metal Gods
Kneel before them
Kneel before the steel

Colossal doom approaches
Titans have arrived
Enslaving all before them
God failed to save
He lied

Screaming metal
Molten blood
Kneel before them
Kneel before the steel
