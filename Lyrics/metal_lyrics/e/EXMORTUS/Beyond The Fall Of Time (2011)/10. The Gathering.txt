Facing the sky as itâs falling
Of hope and life we are deprived
Broken shards crushed by the mauling
Fall of time, gathering of the five

Time is now ours
We have arrived...
Exploiting the planar spheres
Conflux and chaos
Fire and ice
Your worldâs in ruin
Doomed to die
None will survive
For gathered have the five

Black magic spell cast
We have arrived...
Oppressing the sacred realms
Lost in the darkness
Blood tears you cry
Orbits are shattered
Worlds collide
The tower descends upon a sea of red to lie

Shadows annihilate resistance
Killing the sun, destroying its shine
Uncovered the truth of existence
Caballing the end, the Fall of Time
