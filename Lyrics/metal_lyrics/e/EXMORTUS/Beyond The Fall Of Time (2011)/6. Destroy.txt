Inhaling the stench of burning infants
Ashy remains filling our lungs
Weâve come to destroy

Sacrifice
On cold dead nights
Reign
When the stars align

Hearing the cry of defiled mothers
Forcing them to eat their own young
Weâve come to destroy

Mutilation
Behold new ways to kill
Fiendish lust
Succumb to its will

Within your dreams I whisper
Nightmares gorged in red
Insanity encroaches
Of life Iâll be fed
The ancient one awaits

Marching
Scourge the land with crushing might
All fear the Shadowblight
Rising
From the depths we hear its call
The meek will surely fall

Weâve come to destroy

Within your dreams I whisper
Nightmares gorged in red
Insanity encroaches
Of life Iâll be fed
Now drink their blood

Tasting the flesh from rotten corpses
Gnawing at limbs reeking of death
Weâve come to destroy

The ancient one awaits

Marching
Scourge the land with crushing might
All fear the the fall of time
Rising
From the depths we hear its call
The meek will surely fall
