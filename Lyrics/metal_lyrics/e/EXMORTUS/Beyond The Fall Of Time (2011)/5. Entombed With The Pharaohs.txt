Beyond the Nile
Collapsing sun is seen by all
The sacred eye bleeds from its throne
To be entombed with the pharaohs
Entombed

Darkness, eternal master conquers man
The curse is plagued upon the putrid sands
Venomous kiss, the serpentâs bite pulsates through the vein of life

Beyond the Nile
Collapsing sun
Fallen God from the sky
Is now entombed with the pharaohs
Entombed

Flowing venom scorches my withered remains
Rotting flesh
Dethroned, cast down, amongst the forgotten I lie
Dying God
Summon the hordes of the jackal
As the power of light wanes to its end
Drowning in blood, humanity cries in disgust
Burning shame

Beyond the Nile
Collapsing sun
Has been entombed with the pharaohs
Entombed
Forever

Broken, shattered disks have masked the floor
He who rises shall rise no more
Amongst the lions, he forfeits majesty
Basking in his travesty

Rotting flesh
Feast for the carrion to dine
Beneath the wasteland

Bow down to Set

The serpents coil
The task is done
Venom
No resurrection, only death
Triumph

Cessation of blinding luminance
Gone forever
Dawn of darkness, the throne is mine
