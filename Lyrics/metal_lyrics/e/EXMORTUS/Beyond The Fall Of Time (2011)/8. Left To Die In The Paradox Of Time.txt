Darkness creeps in slowly
Humanity is lost
Time is ripped to shreds
Unrelenting horrors
Senses hurled and tossed
Hanging by a thread
Careening through the vortex
Your mind is torn apart
A universe begins to burn
Memories colliding
Warping screams distort
Banished with no return
(Banished with no return)

Sanity corrupted
By the endless span of time
Forgotten in the abyss
Infinity unravels
Itâs punishment divine
Alone in nothingness
Life non-existent
Aeons in the void
Mysteries are revealed
Cosmic ultimatum
Eternally destroyed
The secrets still concealed
(Secrets still concealed)

Suns begin to falter
Theyâre ashes on the wind
Who holds the keys?

Youâre left to die
In the paradox of time
Itâs too late
No turning back now
Youâre far beyond the light

The cosmos fold before me
Inside this endless dream
Countless alternations
I canât even force a scream
Shivering in the darkness
Iâm afraid I cannot last
I stare into my future,
My present and my past
The fall of time decided,
The Gods play their game
Floating here forgotten
My mind begins to fade...

Youâre all alone

Conscious fading quickly
Reality is gone
Forever in the night
Decades lost in minutes
Insanity has won
Devouring the light
Comprehension dawning
The totality of all
Finding not an end
Darkness lies beyond this
The nexus starts its call
Out of time my friend

Emptiness surrounds me
These Myths are all too real
We hold the keys...

Iâm left to die
In the paradox of time
Itâs too late
No turning back now
Iâm lost beyond the light
