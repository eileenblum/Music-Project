Ancient violence!
must we all propagate
for peace unnegotiable
appeasing the vulgate
the clergy's insatiable
thirst for bloodshed
their eyes are blood red
blind with vengeance
behold, ancient violence!

Pulverized to death!
Precious life bereft!

Place your faith in those who speak with the unseen 
relentless genocide; crimes unseen

Kiss the floor, obey the sovereign 
as he commands the slaughter of brethren

Ancient violence!
must we intensify
a hunger so voracious
impossible to satisfy
warmonger's rapacious
lust for power
the people cower
rule without prudence
behold, ancient violence!

Pulverized to death!
Precious life bereft!
