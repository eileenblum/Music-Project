Welcome to the realm of darkness
We are anxious for your blood

Rising from the depths we crawl
Rising to the power all

Again to the cup of shadows
We relish in your fear

Rising from the depths we crawl
Boiling to the power all

[Solo]

We rise to restore the light
Into nothingness you fall

Rising from the depths we crawl
Rising to the power all
