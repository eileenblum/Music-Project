Born into chains ever cursing our birth
so hearken my friends, we must vanquish our plight
by numbers by force we lift the curse
from the slavery we shall arise in might

Raise your swords up high my friends!

Raise your swords up high!

Behold! Their immortal kings, our foes
Fallen! Writhing in their death-throes
Alas! They lie obliterated into nothingness
Grim death! Is dealt, Immortality made flesh

Ruling with fear and with false renown
boasting sovereignty, protecting so-called rights divine
by heritage you gained your crown
But blood will be the price of mine

Take your plots to hell with you!
take your plots to hell!

Alas! Thou immortal king, my foe
Fallen! Writhing in thy death-throes
Thy convulsing face by my flail, I thresh
grim death I deal, immortality made flesh

Commanding your slaves to conquer the lands
whilst sitting on satin and guzzling fine wine
true valor I gained not from lofty divans
but from the abyss to the throne I have climbed

Raise your swords up high my friends!

Raise your swords up high!

Behold! Their immortal kings, our foes
Fallen! Writhing in their death-throes
Alas! They lie obliterated into nothingness
Grim death! Is dealt, Immortality made flesh
