Immortal alloy forged
bringer of endless war
tempered steel you will feel
when the reaper makes his deal

Bow to your master for Metal is king
Unto the naysayers death I shall bring

Merciless conquering
victory to the Metal kings
glorybound, strike them down
crack the sky and burn the ground

Bow to your master for Metal is king
Unto the naysayers death I shall bring

Forget all you heard
there's no power in the word
for when the reaper makes his deal
trust in your steel

Swear by the hilt
allegiance thence is built
for when the reaper makes his deal
trust in your steel

when the reaper makes his deal
trust in your steel

Metal is king, all hail the king
Metal is king, all hail the king
Metal is king!

Immortal alloy forged

Bringer of endless war
tempered steel you will feel

When the reaper makes his deal

Bow to your master for Metal is king
Unto the naysayers death I shall bring
