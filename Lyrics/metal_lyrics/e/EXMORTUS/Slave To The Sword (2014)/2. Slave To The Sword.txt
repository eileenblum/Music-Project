With my sword in hand
I shall conquer all the land
Immortal
Supremacy is sought
Whence the blade was wrought

Behold the power I wield
Straight from the core
Immortal steel
Enslaving the world

[6x]
Slave to the sword

I am he the bold
As the myth is told
Immortal
Raising fear on high
'Til the day you die

Slave to the sword

[2x]
Taking and raping
The women enslaving
To chains all the children
Invading to pillage
The village
All things I ravage
I'm savage

You are the slave to the sword
Slave to the sword
You are slave to the sword

Slave to the sword
You are slave to the sword

Slave to the sword
You are slave to the sword
Slave to the sword

Slave to the sword
You are slave to the sword

Behold the bloody crown
Forgotten burial mound
All men are mortal
Alas amongst the dead
For once mine enemies said

You may be king amongst men
Master of war
But still you remain
Slave to the sword

[7x]
Slave to the sword
