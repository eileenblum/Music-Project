What was I
Deepest dark abyss
Black iron
Heavy metal force of steel
Insidious
I brought the balance
Soul stealer
Descending that you feel

[Chorus:]
[?] on my quest
None [?] the power of a sword
Those who remain shall know my name
Foe Hammer

Murderous
Symmetry renewed
Red vision
Fill my [?] with hate
Carnivorous
Feeding flesh and blood
Perpetual
Now nothing combat

[Chorus]

[Solo]

What was I
Deepest dark abyss
Black iron
Heavy metal force of steel
Insidious
I brought the balance
Soul stealer
Descending that you feel

[Chorus]

Bite my blade
Taste my steel

You will bite the blade
Taste the steel

[Solo]

Even more slain than fall
Men shall fall

Foe Hammer
