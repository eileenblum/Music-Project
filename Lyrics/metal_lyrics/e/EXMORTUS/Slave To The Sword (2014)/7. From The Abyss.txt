Of old was an age when all was darkness
and unwrought was the earth
old of was an age when all was emptiness
thence chaos had its mirth

Unbegotten beings of the cosmos
from the abyss we arose

Th the world comes war
we are the vast nothingness
out of ancient void we are
from beyond, from the abyss

Awake are the eyes from ancient slumber
intent to end all life
awake are the eyes of insentient wonder
we've not forgotten our strife

Unbegotten beings of the cosmos
from the abyss we arose

To the world comes war
we are the vast nothingness
out of ancient void we are
from beyond, from the abyss

Anew is the spiritual upheaval
lying slain are the meek
anew is the reign of rage primeval
earth's blood we shall leak

Unbegotten beings of the cosmos
from the abyss we arose

To the world comes war
we are the vast nothingness
out of ancient void we are
from beyond, from the abyss

Unbegotten beings of the cosmos
from the abyss we arose
