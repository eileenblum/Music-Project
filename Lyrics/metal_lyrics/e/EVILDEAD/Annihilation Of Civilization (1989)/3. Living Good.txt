White ivory towers, bestowed Holy powers,
the right to take money for He-
Has given permission, to take the comission,
Receiving salvation through greed,
This man in his new suit, His wife loyal recruit,
A percent of my income they'll take,
Hypocritical faggot, the crucifix you drag it,
Your Holy Intensions are fake!
Adultress bi-sexual, not one time but several,
The Bible damns to hell for this sin,
If you're truly chosen, then hell must be frozen,
And the Heaven's caving down from within.
A scandalous frenzy, the culprits are many,
Multi-millions involved in this case,
A preacher vendictive, wife cocaine addicted,
Blood tears running down from Her face!
They've taken the palace, the diamond stud chalice,
The Rolls Royce, the Palm Springs estate,
We're living so well, with Religion to sell,
And getting rich, "Oh, God is so great"
Adultress bi-sexual, not one time but several,
The Bible damns to hell for this sin,
If you're truly chosen, then hell must be frozen,
And the Heaven's caving down from within.

Send more dollars in contributions,
make donations in big amounts,
In God we trust incorporated,
Just add the limo' to the account,
Wicked deeds that you can't hide,
Justice's done your program's gone
ROB THE BLIND
PRAISE THE LORD
RAPE THE YOUNG
MOTEL FUN
ALL FOR MONEY
THE ROOT OF EVIL
GETTING RICH
AIN'T LIFE A BITCH?
LIVING GOOD...
I the name of God
LIVING GOOD...
Caught in the trap.
