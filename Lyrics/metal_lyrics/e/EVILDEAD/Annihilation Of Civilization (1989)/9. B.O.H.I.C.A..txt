[bonus track]

[Music and Lyrics: Evildead]

It's only human primeval instinct
Internal urges, the way all men think
Romantic setting, or in the back seat
For free of money just grinding our meat

Bend over here it comes again !

To hell with rubbers I need the moisture
A real woman, and not a picture
A gleaming brown eye, between two nice buns
Subsonic friction, until one of us comes.

Bend over here it comes again !

[Lead break: Albert Gonzales]

Black or white, I don't discriminate
Fuck all the bigots; they can stay home and masturbate
So girl beware of my probing anal tongue dart
I'll kiss your bush, and spread your cheeks apart

Bend over here it comes again !

[End solo: Casey McMakin]
