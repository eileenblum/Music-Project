Living life in L.A., crowded valley to bay,
A Human jungle that drives you insane,
Cruising the freeways, dodging bullets of death,
I rigger mad maniacs on the prowl for a thrill
An Open Highway, and a cold six-pack,
A loaded shotgun with no turning back,
Toilgate your victim, make him nervous and scared,
Blow out his windows, let him know that you are there,
Sideswipe the witness, and anyone else in your way,
Show'em your weapons, infra-red scope in their face.
A GUN BY YOUR SIDE
REVENGE ON YOUR MIND
GONE SHOOTING!
THRILLS IN THE NIGHT
SHIVER YOUR SPINE
GONE SHOOTING!

[solo: Gonzales]

An open highway, and a cold six-pack,
A loaded shotgun with no turning back,
Cruising death lane, feeling no shame,
Malicious intent...GONE SHOOTING!
Approach a black and white, stay out of sight,
Won't got caught...GONE SHOOTING!
Cop on your tail, your plan won't fail,
Keep the faith...GONE SHOOTING!
One way ticket, straight to hell,
Gone berzrk...GONE SHOOTING!
Target in sight, who's wrong or right?
Arm for the head, one shot, one dead
Cracking some rounds, the powerful sound,
Metal on flesh, echos the night

[Lead: Garcia]

Wreckage behind, no survivors in sight,
Pile-up of cars on interstate 5
Make a clean getaway, be in bed by the day,
Dreams of van carpooling to work

[Lead: Garcia]
[Leads: Garcia/Gonzales]

A GUN BY YOUR SIDE
REVENGE ON YOUR MIND
GONE SHOOTING!
THRILLS IN THE NIGHT
SHIVER YOUR SPINE
GONE SHOOTING!
Tailgate your victim, make him nervous and scared,
Blow out his windows, let him know that you are there,
Sideswipe the witness, and anyone else in your way,
Show'em your weapons, and end their whole suckin' race...Now!
