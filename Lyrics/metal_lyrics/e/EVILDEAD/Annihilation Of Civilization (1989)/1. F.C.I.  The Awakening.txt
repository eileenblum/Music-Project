The forest is moving, the trees are alive
Apparitions awaken to kill...
Possessing your body, tormenting your mind
Unrelenting, you've no place to hide
The demons will eat you, tear apart and digest you
This is hell in your mortal life
The whore you made love to, the one who will stalk you
Her loving hand will drive in the knife

The Book of the Dead is not open for the living to see
The Book has been read, evil curses your blood it will be

Incantations, echo at night
Screams vibrate your head as your brain begins to bleed
Fornication, pools of semen surround you
Swimming through your body as it pours out before you
Dismemberment, re-attachment
Each piece possessed with a mind of its own
Petrified, insertion of evil
The sphincter of death blows you out its backside

The Book of the Dead is not open for the living to see
The Book has been read, evil curses your blood it will be
You shall die like others before you while your god looks on
For nothing on Earth can save you from the awakening !
