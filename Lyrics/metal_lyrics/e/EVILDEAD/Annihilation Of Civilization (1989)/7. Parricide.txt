Arguments that start from sibling rivalry,
Battered and bruised, his parents beat him nightly,
Born with defects deformed and unsightly,
Treated like shit always taken lightly.
It's late at night the family is sleeping,
His brother's the first, wakes up without thinking,
A knife across his throat He's factaly bleeding,
Ripped into shreds, brain fluid's seeping.

[solo: Garcia]

Mom and Dad died in bed their bodies are burning,
Sister's guts were ripped out; Her dog used as stuffing,
With all this fresh meat lying around The PARRICIDE starts thinking,
"It's such a shame to let it rot, I might as well start eating".
DECLARE ME CRAZY
LEGALLY INSANE
LET ME OUT IN FIVE YEARS
TO DO IT ALL AGAIN
AND TAKE MY OWN LIFE
AND BECOME A EVIL SOUL
POSSESS THE MINDS OF OTHERS
AND MAKE THEM KILL THEIR OWN...

[solo: Gonzales]

INSANITY DISEASE
MY SICK DECAYING MIND
I WAS ONLY MADE THIS WAY
DEFORMED, DECREPIT, DYING
THE RESULT OF ENDLESS YEARS
BLOOD, MY SWEET, MY TEARS
BRED TO LIVE ON HATE
PSYCHOPATHIC MENTAL STATE
FORESEE MY FATE-NO PITY ALL HATE
ELECT ME TO - A FOREIGN STATE
IN 18 YEARS - THREE SETS OF 6
THE HOLY LAND - CONTROLLING YOU.
