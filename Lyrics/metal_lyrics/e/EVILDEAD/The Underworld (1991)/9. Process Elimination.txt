Black moon is on the rise,
Air raid the sirens sound,
Population in despair,
Warlords they sit and laugh,
Chemical rain upon the earth,
Invisible killers path,
Melting minds in demise,
Hear the human cries...

Radiation's coming
From the nuclear blast
Lurking into cities,
Darkness in the skies
Feel the wrath upon us,
Sudden thunder roars
Armageddon warriors
Now survive the war.

The sea turns to blood
Pain and hunger control us,
Psychic warfare in combat,
Burning sensation's in the air,
Our leaders power play,
With strategic codes to gain,
Computers homicides,
Programming nations end of time.

Radiation's coming
From the nuclear blast
Lurking into cities,
Darkness in the skies
Feel the wrath upon us,
Sudden thunder roars
Armageddon warriors
Now survive the war.

You will cry out...once you find out...
Slow death...preparesfor...
Left behind...deteriorate...

[solos: DF, JG]

Kings of the east launch their attack,
Missiles cover the atmosphere,
Acid fog roams the land,
Deteriorating bodies of the damned
Shear terror grips thy soul,
Revelation takes its toll,
Bite your tongue in pain,
As the world burns in flames!!!

Radiation's coming
From the nuclear blast
Lurking into cities,
Darkness in the skies
Feel the wrath upon us,
Sudden thunder roars
Armageddon warriors
Now survive the war.
