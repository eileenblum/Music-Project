We read your words in disgust
What gives you the right
To talk about us?
Wish you were up on the stage
Childhood fantasy; now jealous rage
How could you claim
Your fortune and fame?

Objective view or so you say
Forget the speech, it's time to play

Let out your frustrations
Hide your jealousy
Your talk is cheap
That's why we get your mag's for free
Pathetic, little cynic!
Where is your family?
Can it be, no attention!
Was ever given to thee?

The critic the cynic
Good. Bad, fair, fine, OK, that's great
The critic the cynic
Opinions that vary you love to hate,
The critic the cynic
We are the reason why you are employed
The critic the cynic
Giving a job to a child with toys

At times I held your view
In such high regards
But egotistically
You build up a guard
Pathetic, little cynic!
What do you do for the scene?
Can it be, no attention!
Will ever come to thee?
