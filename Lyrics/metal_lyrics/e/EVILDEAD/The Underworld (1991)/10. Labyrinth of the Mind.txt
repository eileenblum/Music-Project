Deadly tumor in your brain,
Can't think are you insane?
Lifeless zombie you've become,
Your fate lies in their hands,
Vegetable to be,
Death can set you free,
One slip of the knife
And you're paralyzed

Enter the trauma room,
X-rays show a jagged skull,
Blood clot pressing at your brain,
Prop the head make the incision,
Aneurysm, power drill to saw,
Needles nibbling under the skin,
Silence you hear no sounds,
Impending claustrophobic thoughts.

Fight to cling to life/
State of dementia
Lobotomy!
Labyrinth of the mind/
State of dementia
Insanity!
Psychotic lunatic,
Serial killer number one,
Left no choice to the state,
Except to correct your warped mind,
Threat to society you've become,
Now locked up in the mental ward,
Ending life is your motive,
Surgical guidance is your warning.

Subconscious/Metal rage
Brutal/Violent maze
Transforming/ Killing spree
Torture/ Inflicting pain

Fight to cling to life/
State of dementia
Lobotomy!
Labirinth of the mind/
State of dementia
Insanity!

[solos: JG, DF]

Deadly tumor in your brain,
Time's here to end the pain,
Lifeless zombies you've become,
Your fate lies in their hands,
Vegetable to be,
Death can set you free,
One slip of the knife
And you're paralyzed.
