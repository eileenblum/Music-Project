Few care about environment in the USA
Propaganda controls,
Pollutants in the atmosphere,
Malathion in our air
Mutant race developing,
Hypodermic sewage on shorelines,
Oil spills in the sea
Marine life disappears,
Extermination we contend,
Vanishing life we see
Reality's nightmare,
Environment litigations,
Hazardous contamination
Lost cause situation,
Power plants pump the waste,
Dump sites overwhelm
Wildlife deteriorating.
Cars polluting/All our air/
Smog fills / Our lungs to hell
Politicians/Don't really care/
End this crisis
They never will.
Rapid pollution of the sea
Sewage falling out of greed

Global warming! Nationwide situation
Harmful waste! Nuclear cultivation
Garbage overflows...
...From land to shining sea
We deserve what we create,
In the Land of the Free
Toxic waste, generation harvest
Carbon dioxide in the air
That we breathe
In the air that we breathe!

Global warming! Nationwide situation
Harmful waste! Nuclear cultivation

Ultra violet/Radiation/

Global warming...
...Making profits all they care
Global warming...
