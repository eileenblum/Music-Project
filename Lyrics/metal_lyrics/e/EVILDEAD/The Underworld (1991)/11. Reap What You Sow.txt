As I look into your eyes,
I see a dark spiritual being,

Then in the darkness, your soul
Bleeding, writhing, screaming...
Hating, fighting, loathing, reject,
The hands of death
Take your life away...
Search for the light
At the end of the tunnel
Black or white your soul will travel.

Reap what you sow...
Reap what you sow...
The seeds implanted!
Reap what you sow (Sow!)
Karmic reality

Newborn, rebirth, embryonic state
The grip so tight you feel it slip away
Search for the light
At the end of the tunnel
Black or white your soul will travel.

Six feet, underground,
Hopeless soul, discord vibrate
Mortal of life, discomfort state,
Death becomes, continuation
Resurrection, purgatory,
Determined sex, the other side
Parallel ways,
The mind expands, spiritual progress,
Seeing through the souls of the Dead...

Grasp your new life/Leave the old flesh
In the new world/Reap what you sow...
No accidents,
Pure consciousness, revive!
Individually, to mortality, renamed!
Given second chance,
To proclaimed, rejuvenate!
Cast out,
Gaze into the souls of the dead...

Reap what you sow...Reap what you sow
The seeds implanted!
Reap what you sow (Sow!)
Karmic reality...
Reap what you sow...
