I am struggling to see the light of day create
An image so perfect crystal clear
Don't plant the seeds of worry and fear
For they might adhere to all the things that you hold dear
The universe may have another plan
To guide us from afar and help us understand
The only way to escape the ordinary
Is to be constantly evolving
Our eyes always compromised
Blinded by our own demise
How can we call this progress
If we destroy ourselves in the process?
