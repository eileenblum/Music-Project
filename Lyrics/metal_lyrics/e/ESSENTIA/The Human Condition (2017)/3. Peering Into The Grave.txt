We are not eternal
Mortality is a given in a world such as this
It's not the fear of death that cripples us
The unknown transition, the imminent end
Peering into the grave to understand the gift of life
In it's fragile form
As we are born, we slowly gravitate
Towards the end of this mortal coil
We distance ourselves from what we can't understand
Merely living on borrowed breath
The balance of life and death
Returns this form to dust
