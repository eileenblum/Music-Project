Born into a world that's not my own
These eyes have woken too
Born into a world that's not my own
These eyes have seen through you
Wandering towards the brighter light
Desperate hands yearning to feel the warmth
Please give me all that I need to survive
To once again experience
With every fleeting moment I detach further from reality
All fibers of this being longing to become free
Why do I feel this life is suppressed?
This battered mind is far behind, my soul contests
Do I listen to my heart or my mind
When each is guiding me to this divide
I am a ghost that everybody can see
Lock eyes with the future before me
