I've come a long way since my first notion
Set in motion by life's progress
Propelled through process to gain awareness
In hopes I'd find my way home
Crippled in self doubt with no signs or way out
Irrelevance in my wake
It feels as if I don't exist
How can I pour from an empty vessel
With every feeling dead and left unsated
I need a moment to embrace and reflect
My mind is wandering
Emerged in constant apathy
It's draining life from my soul
For what I've come to expect
Is the inability to connect
