This is all that I am
Though my conscious woke long ago
Long before I ever set foot in the outside world
To be awake, awake for countless years and centuries
Invoking the memories of old, they are long forgotten
Deep within the darkness of my reforming mind
I yearn to travel to this place
What is and what should never be
Is this not the embodiment of our aspirations?
These dreams are constantly evolving
