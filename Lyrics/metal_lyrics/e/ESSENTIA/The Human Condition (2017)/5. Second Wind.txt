You can't pull yourself up when there's nothing to hold onto
Disparity clouding moments of clarity
When there's nothing left, your mind drifts
Revelations occur within our minds
Realizations elapse with time
To push through the muck and mire
Dig deep and refuse to expire
Shut out the thought of defeat
Stay strong, and never retreat
