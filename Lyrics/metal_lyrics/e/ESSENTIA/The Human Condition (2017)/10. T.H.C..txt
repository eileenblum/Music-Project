Time is non-existent
This is just a dream
Caught up in the here and now
All is not what it seems
This is just a dream
Vision blurs, it starts to fade
My thoughts lost in a drifting haze
The whole world is lit ablaze
Take a moment to clear your mind, and just breathe
The air expands
The knowledge that has brought us to a higher place
Flowing swiftly through connections made in open space
To enlighten what has been discovered
To shed light where darkness reigns
And validate this existence
Memory seeps away as I go through the motions
Lost in the endless ocean
