When I was born under dying skies
It was a time of mankind's blindness
When every mind was enduring the fight
The struggle binds the eyes that witness
I am starting to realize
Not everything is black and white
The pieces, they fit together
A product of misdirection
The resulting pain of our progression
When will we learn this lesson?
I am starting to realize
Not everything is black and white
The pieces they fit together
Our minds hunger for a thrill
Wandering as time stands still
All of the dreams we have pushed aside
We will not be denied
When I was born under dying skies
It was a time of mankind's blindness
When every mind was enduring the fight
The struggle binds the eyes that witness
