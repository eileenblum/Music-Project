Men of the times long gone
kept count of the days
Observed and memorized
the movements of the stars

Turned to the river with an invitation
And each year it answered them
In rising waters a new beginning
The weary land brought to life again

Silently
I can hear them speak to me

I watch the sunrise
Come forth high water, come forth new life
The stranger who once was lost
has arrived into a haven

I spend a rare moment
in serenity
Days gone and days to come
and me in between

Today I hear the voices of the past
The songs float by along the riverbanks
And here the wheel of time has come around
Let the river flood over me
