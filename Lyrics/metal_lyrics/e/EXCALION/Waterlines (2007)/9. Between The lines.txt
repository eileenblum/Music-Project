I was told to look behind the eyes
But it seems our vision is not clear
The things inside can hardly be set free
Between the lines there are some things I never
want to hear

I tried to convince myself
The feeling is true
Regain understanding
Once between me and you
Create communication
Silence grows vast
Maintain situation
Where the hope could last

Former days are fading memories
The stage is set and the plot is cruel
Like sovereigns we move the borderlines
Some day we must learn how to not destroy
divide and rule

Somewhere along the way we lost
the course and direction
Teach me to beat against the wind
To not run aground
