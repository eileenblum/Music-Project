[Japanese bonus track]

I like to be lost in starlight
Shattered beauty of a little child

I have come here a long way
Beyond the winds, but I wonÂ´t stay
IÂ´m done with those who betray
Anymore nothing goes astray

All unfolds, bitter and realized

Alone I stand with the memories
Tensions arise, bad it feels
Flashback from years behind
Forget is solution IÂ´ll find

I watch from far the ball of vanity
Mindless games of insanity

Try to learn from lived events
Of wisdom it all depends
Acceptance, and the walls are breached
Supremacy is out of our reach

StoryÂ´s told, bitter and realized
Access is denied

Alone I stand with the memories
Tension arise, bad it feels
Flashback from years behind
Forget is solution IÂ´ll find

Show me why the door is closed
Why, why IÂ´m not chosen
Help me understand my anger
Hold my hand before a stranger
