Here lies the formless world weÂ´re living in
Gravity is finally giving in
Bad dreams appear to me as cloudy haze
To lose sight of you is to disengage

High altitudes and still upward we go
I was never meant to lead but to follow

We are
like a double shining shooting star
Unheard-of things in earthly radar
One day
I could speed up and soar too high
A dying star would light the sky

Sometimes I cannot help but wonder why
are there no stronger winds for me to ride
But to lose sight of you is to disengage
Arrogance would be my last disgrace
