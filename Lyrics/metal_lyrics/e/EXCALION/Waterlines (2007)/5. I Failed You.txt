This task was burden
It was placed on my shoulders
The goal is near
But I lose all the answers

Suffer in my eyes
Defeat comes to conquer me
Are these goodbyes?
No escape to victory

I promised to keep you safe, for eternity
Now you realize what my words are worth
I promised to keep you warm, forever
Here in the end I pray you still keep forth

Drain out of strength
Left you on your own
All was a play
It was I who left you down

In words forgiveness
All is doomed to fail
The fear that hides within
Leaves in soul a trail

Weeping heart longs for rest, tonight
I travel by the memory lane
There's no life in the void, ever
But I remain still the same
