How different are the doors and walkways when itÂ´s dark outside
The sounds and memories appear to twist and turn the mind
The rainy days have gone on far too long to be recalled
I crossed a line
and now itÂ´s time
for another night

Looking for me
behind the windowpane
the phantom face
words seem to be in vain
Looking for me
Arriving as the dark
the shadowy
dream-thing who bears a scarred mark

How different are the minds and mind-plays when itÂ´s dark inside
I get the strongest boards to block all of my windows tight
The walls around me rise as ramparts, make me safe and sound
And still IÂ´m far
further from home
than ever before
