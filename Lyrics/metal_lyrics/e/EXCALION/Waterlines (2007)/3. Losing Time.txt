Arriving to oblivion, I am just waking up
If all this is reality, worse than a bad dream
ItÂ´s hard to stay awake in here where we all look each others faults
One day it must be clear that no one is save from those

Look at yourself, this roadÂ´s a dead end
I have been lost in this dream of mine
Can anyone tell, what has happened?
Is all too late?  IÂ´m losing time

All changes make me grumble, telling me to speak up
All thoughts in distortion, make all look strange
Who is the one, who will help me to separate from old
Who will come, running to me when the moment is told

Look at yourself, this roadÂ´s a dead end
I have been lost in this dream of mine
Can anyone tell, what has happened?
Is is too late?  When remorse fades your hope away

The darkness grows near thereÂ´s no moment to lose
