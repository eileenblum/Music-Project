Patience is a thing that we donÂ´t have
We rush into things that we donÂ´t understand
Life floods in our newborn veins
Intoxicating our reason in brain

All is new to us, in all we trust
Life is our lust

Fast we will run towards our destiny
All is ahead, we will never be the same
Now I will know thereÂ´s much more than this
The knowledge does not bring the wisdom of this game

The night comes too early, our time has come
To take a step forward to the real world
We all donÂ´t make it through, someÂ´ll fall behind
They make their choice, to not even try

Now the things are clear, to us to fear
And what to hold dear

Fast we will run towards our destiny
All is ahead, we will never be the same
Now I will know thereÂ´s a much more than this
The knowledge does not bring the wisdom of this game
