[Music: Jarmo Myllyvirta, Lyrics: Tero Vaaja]

A bullet train is coming through
Rain and gasoline
Hear the melody?
Do as winners do

Life is calling my number
In this place and time
It's fine to be alive
It's fine to be alive

No need
For fortune, hope or glory
I have a lifetime
To make history

For me
It's not a game of hide and seek
I have a lifetime
That's all the time I need

A stray dog is coming through
Lost and never found
A homeless greyhound
Do as drifters do

Today no closed doors or dead ends
But open air and sun
Let it all come
Every day someone is born again
I want to be that one
Let it all come
