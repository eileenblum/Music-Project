[Music: Jarmo Myllyvirta, Lyrics: Tero Vaaja]

Further away each and every day
I'll find a way to cross every ocean
Loneliness, a permanent emotion
Wherever may the journeyman stay

I'm on my way from somewhere to anywhere
I have learned not to ask when
I'll be there

You don't have to call me homeless
I'm at home in every place
But wherever I may go
I'll never be coming back home

The east and west, northlands and the rest
It's all the same, it's all a fair game
Loneliness has become my second name
But something still keeps up the flame
