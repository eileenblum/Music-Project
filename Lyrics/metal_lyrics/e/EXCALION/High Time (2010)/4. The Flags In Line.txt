[Music: Jarmo Myllyvirta, Lyrics: Tero Vaaja]

I woke up, the dawn never came
Colder than yesterday it feels to me
We are coming home, we are young no more
Innocent as before playing our games

Call it a dream or an ideal
It's gone anyway
And the banners of the nations...

Today
They will march no more
The flags in line
They march no more
Today
Daydreams turned into grief
And disbelief

I see all the faces in the crowd
No more looking so proud or glorious
Our illusions are forever gone
And many deeds are done that can't be reversed

I woke up, the dawn never came
Colder than yesterday it feels to me
All these young men, they are young no more
To their very core they have been changed
