[Music: Jarmo Myllyvirta, Lyrics: Tero Vaaja]

Sometimes your mind makes twists and turns
Dreams up something out of this world
Relieves you of dull sanity
Every once in a while you dream
Or simply forget what is real
And it enables you to flee

Hell or high water
Say hi to mother Earth and father sky

Behold, I just dethroned the laws of gravity
In this place where
My machine is fuelled by quicksilver
It's cold in here, radio is silent for me
Quicksilver ghost
Take me to the world I love the most

Those who are weightless don't need wings
No cosmic gales or solar winds
The world is dark but mind is free
It's you who gets her off the ground
Co-pilot is nowhere to be found
Go find a place beyond belief
