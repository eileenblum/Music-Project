[Music: Jarmo Myllyvirta, Lyrics: Tero Vaaja]

You're not strong on modesty
Or sanity
My favorite enemy
I found your head in clouds
Ten miles from the ground
Quite frequently

If you were here now
I would have to say
I don't think I know you
Like I did one day

Song that goes on forever
The song we compose together

So many times before
I closed this door
To come back nevermore
See, stars can't leave the show
You never know
What the future has in store

Song that goes on forever
The song we compose together
The ghosts of long gone bad days
They will return as always
Tormenting us everywhere

If you were here now
I would have to say
I don't think I know you
Like I did one day
False close and refrain
Our way of life stands
I don't have more to give
No wonders in my hands
