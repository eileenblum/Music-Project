[Music: Jarmo Myllyvirta, Lyrics: Tero Vaaja]

Fifteen days and nights
Out here in the wild
What is it that I'm hunting for
I'm not sure

It is moving fast
Through its native land
It is always one day ahead
Out of sight

Bring on the storm
Let it rage on

Won't give up, not this time
Can't stop now, anymore
It's time to finally gain the ground

I call upon the sky
Strike me with all your might
And see if I will turn around

Bring on the storm
Let it rage on
Make all my fears take form
Let it rain on my castle's keep
My mountain and my ocean's deep
Bring on the storm
