Finally I see that my time is near
My sight is clear, filled with fear
In here all that I see is grey
Only lies are what will remain

What we teach our children
Tomorrow, what they'll sing
If the evil one wins

Shall my deeds remain after me
May my sons make it real
Wise words will echo in their hearts
Then brighter will shine my star

Behind the curtain of beauty
Awaits the hungry beast
If the blind leads the blind

Our legacy is phasing away
No respect for what the elders said
Forgotten is the path to our fathers' days
Few are those who know the way

Behind the curtain of beauty
Awaits the hungry beast
If the blind leads the blind

A cry in the wind
Will guide the way to my keep
And the singing of the angels
Sets me free
Will I leave my mark
In the hearts of the righteous ones
Is this the death of our day?
We'll fade
