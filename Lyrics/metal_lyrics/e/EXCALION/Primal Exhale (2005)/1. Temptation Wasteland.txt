You'd rather smash the mirror
Than look yourself in the eye
Truth in its coldness
Could make your childish dreams die

The world is a stage where the legends are made
But its cast is of farce
The price to be paid is getting heavier today
For all the fast-burning shooting stars

Give me a fight with the snake in the wasteland
I need to be a victor at least over me
Give me a chance to get hurt one more time
That way I will know I'm alive

Reality is for sale today
Just in case you lost your own
The image stream will make you forget
Your unperfect reflection
