For me adorement outspoken
Along with the blinding flashlights
Pieces of me are wanted and taken
I had never before felt stagefright
It was a song that just came through me
Like hundreds before had done
But this one had a different feel
This time I wrote too good a song

I'm told my soul is sold
For the moment in the spotlight
I never knew the price
Of the moment in the spotlight

I will be played through, then I'm gone
After the show is the light-switch turned
That much of the place in the sun
I should have let that note-sheet burn
Tomorrow I'll have a new song
To strike a fresh new note
Back to basics where I belong
I wish the system would let me out
