Others have gone to paradise, those who made the sacrifice
Not everyone did the rightful acts, they've come to end of their laps
Things you did, were they justified, crimes you made you just denied
Forgiveness allowed to everyone, look far behind and see what you've done

Do you decide horror and pain
Or glory and grace that many claim
Don't fear footsteps know what is to be
That you will see, you will see

In time when your judgement is called, in a place where many fall
Your future gods only know, soon you'll see where you have to go
Step ahead and confess your sins, take what they have to give
All chances flown by, too late to kneel and apologize

Do you decide horror and pain
Or glory and grace that many claim
Don't fear footsteps know what is to be
That you will see

Power and desire to prevail is a great temptation
No vengeance no grief makes away you can find
Will to success in this life ends in an obsession
Todays rivalry leads our way and to darkness us binds

"Behold the punishment yourself you set, finally you pay what you owe, your debt
First time in history you've been justed, no prays for your soul when bones turn to dust"
