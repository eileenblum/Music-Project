I am losing my reality
If their lies turn to truth
I'm surrounded by their cruelty
Only one way to choose

They blow the light away
And I start to fade
The edge of life and death
I scream for the death
I wished from a shooting star
To bring the end to this time
My burning torch's fire
Guides me through the night

The greatness lays in one's heart
Just release your desire
The new sun is rising soon
And the liars burn in fire

Why? The world is stage of lies
Deceiveness will rule our lives
Oh, we can sing about the love
It is just disguise
For the lies

Liars acting nice behind the golden smile
Poison dripping tongue, like father, like son
Why am I so blind that I can not see?
All these well-dressed snakes, all around me
