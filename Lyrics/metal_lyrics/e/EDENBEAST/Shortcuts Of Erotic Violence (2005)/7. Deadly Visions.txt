I see black shades around the fire
Their silhouettes are full of burning lust
Their shapes are full of my desires
Their movements are gracious and so fast

The fiery spirits in the sky"
Flying away by burning sparks
They're dancing just for me tonight
They die away to light the dark
Oh, how I want this flame to burn
Inside my veins, inside my soul
To melt the iceberg of my core
To fill my memory's empty halls

And looking to this fiery mirror
I want to see the future tonight
To make the turbid visions clearer
I sacrifice my boiling blood
I want to set my soul aflame
I kneel and pray to give me power
To stop this pain, this empty pain
To burn away my fear's tower
The fiery spirits in the sky"
Flying away by burning sparks
They're dancing just for me tonight
They die away to light the dark
Oh, how I want this flame to burn
Inside my veins, inside my soul
To melt the iceberg of my core
To fill my memory's empty halls

I feel so cold, so very cold, the ecstasy has gone away
I try to move but I can not, and I prey
And the visions fill my mind as I spill my hot red blood
I have looked beyond the time now I must pay for this crime"
By my life"
