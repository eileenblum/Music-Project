Eternity"time passes by
The wasted years"smoke to the sky
The afterlife is not for me
Cold emptiness"just leave me be

Feel the freedom, feel the pride
Rise above the holy rites
Deny their hell and paradise
Open your soul, open your eyes

Infernal flames and paradise
It's not for me"too many lies
To live my life like just one day
That's what for me"my game to play

Feel the freedom, feel the pride
Rise above the holy rites
Deny their hell and paradise
Open your soul, open your eyes
