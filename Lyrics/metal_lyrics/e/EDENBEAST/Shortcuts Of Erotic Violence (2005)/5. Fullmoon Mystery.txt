This night has come"
The moon is full, it smiles again
I feel sweet torture of forthcoming changes
Pleasure and pain"
They're slowly driving me insane
Since now for me all human beings are strangers

Night is silent but I hear it's call
It's time to throw away my human skin
I feel sweet pain when on my knees I fall
I feel the brooding of the animal instincts

And then I raise
My head up to the cold black sky
This long awaited moment now has come
In fire of rebirth
My human body dies
The beast within proclaims: "Let it be done!"

Alive and dead"I am the hungry beast
I feel like primal strength is filling my new body
With burning eyes I'm snarling: "More, more, more""
The beast is free, the beast that I was hiding

And looking to
The face of smiling moon
I thrust my howl into nocturnal silence
Oh, my beloved, just wait"I'll join you soon
To whirl you in impassioned dance of violence
