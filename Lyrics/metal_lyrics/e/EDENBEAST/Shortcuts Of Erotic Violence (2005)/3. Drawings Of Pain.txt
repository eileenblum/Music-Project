Open me by the kiss of steel
Do it now while I can't resist
Lick my wounds, drink my blood
Torture me with the lustful smile

No! Don't bury me
No! I'm not dead yet
My time will come
And you will see
Your victory become regret
The scattered pieces of my soul"
I'm still alive inside them all
The bloody traces on my skin
The drawings of the pain within"
Your final gift

Tear the soul off my helpless body
Bury me in violent ecstasy
Feed your lust by my painful rapture
Then go away and leave me with my scars
No! Don't bury me
No! I'm not dead yet
My time will come
And you will see
Your victory become regret
The scattered pieces of my soul"
I'm still alive inside them all
The bloody traces on my skin
The drawings of the pain within"
Your final gift

But since this time you'd better watch your back
Because I'm fractured but I'm still alive
Oneday you'll see me in your nightmare
Open your eyes and understand
The nightmare is reality!

...And when the Sun comes down
Look around and feel the fear
I am here, I am near
I am your curse
Ending your night or day
Look around and feel the fear
I am here, I am near
I'm your tormentor now

But since this time you'd better watch your back
Because I'm fractured but I'm still alive
Oneday you'll see me in your nightmare
Open your eyes and understand
The nightmare is reality
