So mournful is the scenery of Death
So silent is the calm of her embrace
So tranquil is the odour of her breath
Come closer wonderer"closer to my grave

Just close your eyes and hear the soundless whispers
Feel dark enchantment of this gloomy place
So many finished lives, so many human histories
So many different fates, engraved in monuments

Don't walk away"don't leave me here alone
Don't say that you are homeward bound
I was like you but now I'm just the bones
The bones where worms their home have found

Frail sprouts of hope break through the frozen ground
Small sparks of life flame up in every seed
Birds have returned"life conquers all around
So spring has come for you but not for me

Stop for a moment, look around and think
What do you search? Why do you roam? What for?
Oneday you will be surely dead like me
There's no escape, you cannot win this war
Don't walk away"don't leave me here alone
Don't say that you are homeward bound
I was like you but now I'm just the bones
The bones where worms their home have found

And birds will fly away again oneday
And you will join me in this cold ground
And here you will find you home to stay
Why do you tremble now? Why do you make no sound?
