Beauty not from this world
Dressed for burial ground
Mark of death on your skin
Fading flowers around
So serene is your face
Like before the awakening
Soul is so far away
Flesh is in the last waiting

My dreams, my hopes"it's all no more
My love! My soul was killed with you
Death is the way to the better world
But why I cry" I miss you so

Lips are pale and so cold
They won't ever caress
By these hands you embraced me
Now they're laid on your breast
Sleep my love and my life
Died away like a spark
All the light's gone with you

My dreams, my hopes"it's all no more
My love! My soul was killed with you
Death is the way to the better world
But why I cry" I miss you so
I will stand on my knees
Raising hands to your grave
Praying just for one kiss
Just one look at your face
But the marble won't answer
To my pleas and my moans
But the marble won't warm me
There's no life in the stone
I will roam blind and deaf
Days will be dark as nights
Why I can't just go back?
Why I can't turn back time?
Looking down from the sky
Can you read in my eyes
Without you I don't need
Any gift, even life
