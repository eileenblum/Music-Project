Clad in the armour of still aching scars
With blade of hate I wonder in the dark
Through empty chambers of my memory
I search for dreams wherever they can lurk

Pain is locked inside
Doors are locked behind
Chains I've cast inside
Chains that bound my mind
Too much time I was
The prisoner of thoughts
Slave of my own dreams
But tonight I'm free"
And the death walks with me

I see them dying, fractured by my rage
I drink their screams to quench my hate
I'll tear them all apart, they won't escape
I'm suicidal angel of revenge
Pain is locked inside
Doors are locked behind
Chains I've cast inside
Chains that bound my mind
Too much time I was
The prisoner of thoughts
Slave of my own dreams
But tonight I'm free"
And the death walks with me

The final look and hungry shine of steel
The blade cuts the flesh and pain is here
They agonize, I have to feel
'cause from their wounds my blood spills

Pain is locked inside
Doors are locked behind
Chains I've cast inside
Chains that bound my mind
Too much time I was
The prisoner of thoughts
Slave of my own dreams
But tonight I'm free"
And the death walks with me
