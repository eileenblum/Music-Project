Hiding in the darkness, standing here alone
I feel like blood begins to boil inside my veins
The wait is over and here you are
So come to me, my girl"come closer to your fate

I am the beast
Don't waste your tears
Don't try to scream
Just play with me
Run if you want
But you can't hide
Your time has come
You're mine tonight

You can not see me, but I see you
The heart is pounding deep inside my breast
The beast is ready to be released
I gonna feed him tonight on your flesh

I am the beast
Don't waste your tears
Don't try to scream
Just play with me
Run if you want
But you can't hide
Your time has come
You're mine tonight

Right in my arms you're trembling"don't be afraid
Don't try to scream, don't wake my rage
Just look into my eyes and feel my blade
You are my slave tonight, the flesh to rape
I am the beast
Don't waste your tears
Don't try to scream
Just play with me
Run if you want
But you can't hide
Your time has come
You're mine tonight
