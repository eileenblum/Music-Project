[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sanchez]

All began years ago
Created by genius
Bernini and Galilei
Glorious and mysterious

Genius against the priest
The history of crusades
Running for freedom
They want to be free

Illuminati Army
Sacred warriors
Fighting for their secrets
Fighting for their souls

Steel by steel
Death by death
In a holy war... They'll fight !!!
Steel by steel

Hidden sects and secrets
Bloody holy war
Donât fight in vain
Defenders of the holy grail
Defending every treasure
Defenders of the history
An endless fight
All the time, every night

Illuminati Army
Sacred warriors
Fighting for their secrets
Fighting for their souls

Steel by steel
Death by death
In a holy war... They'll fight !!!
Steel by steel

Many screams of vengeance
From the bloody past
Many ancient tales
Written in the dark

Until today
Nobody knows
What is the truth ?
And whatâs really true ?

Illuminati Army
Sacred warriors
Fighting for their secrets
Fighting for their souls

Steel by steel
Death by death
In a holy war... They'll fight !!!
Steel by steel
