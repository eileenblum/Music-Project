[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Alarcon]

I will tell you of love
I will tell you of pain
Youâre living in darkness
Youâre falling in madness

Alone in the dark
Youâre heart is divided
With tears in your eyes
Youâre destined to fight

Dead and buried â Just to leave behind
Dead and buried â Donât hear your mind
Dead and buried â Only hear your heart
Dead and buried â You will pay the price

The sorrow has come
Tricks and lies have begun
You will bury the past
But youâll live with the scar

Alone in the dark
Youâre heart is divided
With tears in your eyes
Youâre destined to fight

Dead and buried â Just to leave behind
Dead and buried â Donât hear your mind
Dead and buried â Only hear your heart
Dead and buried â You will pay the price
The smell of death in the air
Into shadows youâll fall
A banner of pain in your hands
Into hell you will burn

Dead and buried â Just to leave behind
Dead and buried â Donât hear your mind
Dead and buried â Only hear your heart
Dead and buried â You will pay the price
