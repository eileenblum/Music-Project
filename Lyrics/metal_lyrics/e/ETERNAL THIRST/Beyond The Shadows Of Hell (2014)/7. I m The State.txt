[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Alarcon]

Here my word is law
And here... I am the state

I've the power on my hands
While I live you'll be at war
I'm the tyrant on this place
And just sorrow you will get

Hear my word..... or cry
Hear my word..... or die
Hear my word..... or cry
Hear my word..... or die

A blood's ocean from my past
Aberrations and evil mind
You must cry by rage
I don't care because I'm the state

Hear my word..... or cry
Hear my word..... or die
Hear my word..... or cry
Hear my word..... or die

Pain - Death - Blood - Suffer Again

Pain - Death - Blood - I've got Insane
