[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sanchez]

I am plunged in pain
Trapped in my own hell
Slave of my own fate
My brain works in vain

When my judgement comes
My soul will fly away
Many shades surround me
In hell I will rebirth

My life and dignity
My death and insanity
I wanna close my eyes
And leave this world behind

You must.... You must.... You must
Turn off my light
A tragic destiny
A life in agony
Living in this pain
Eating for my veins

I'm paying my mistakes
I'm waiting my decease
I'm guilty of my fate
I'm sentenced on my bed

My life and dignity
My death and insanity
I wanna close my eyes
And leave this world behind

You must.... You must.... You must
Turn off my light

I don't want to live
I can't walk to you
Is it right to change
love for compassion?
..... LOVE .... COMPASSION

Let me feel your love
Let me go, let me sleep
Inside my soul you'll stand
Someday we'll be there... Together

My life and dignity
My death and insanity
I wanna close my eyes
And leave this world behind

You must.... You must.... You must
Turn off my light
