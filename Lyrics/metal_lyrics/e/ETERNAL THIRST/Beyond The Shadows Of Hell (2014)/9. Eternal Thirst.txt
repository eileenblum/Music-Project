[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sandoval / Alarcon / Sanchez / Alvarez]

This world day by day is worse
Power gives to all of them advantage
They satisfy the thirst of wickedness
They satisfy the thirst of impunity

They are damned murderers and liars
All the corruption they should hide
The damned impunity always will exist
And all politics is overshadowed

Thirst - Eternal Thirst - Eternal Thirst
Thirst - Eternal Thirst - Eternal Thirst

We are the same affected... Everywhere
This violence continues exploiting
A bloody war they'll enjoy
We must go on hopeless in darkness

A silly faith will not save them
Divine images will lose their worth
The cruel fight against evil begins
And now, a new scandal has begun

Thirst - Eternal Thirst - Eternal Thirst
Thirst - Eternal Thirst - Eternal Thirst
