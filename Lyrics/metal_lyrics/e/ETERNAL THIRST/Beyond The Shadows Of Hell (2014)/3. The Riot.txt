[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sandoval/Alarcon/Sanchez/Alvarez]

Has begun a bad day
With the fists in  high
The adrenaline is running
The adrenaline is burning

All in the streets
They show rage and violence
They accuse all the abuse
They want the head of the damned

Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riotâ¦ Has begun

A true war
Both parts attack
Not measuring the consequences
Only blood and pain

The city is ruined
The tranquility erased
All will begin again
A great reconstruction

Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riotâ¦ Has begun

Has begun a bad day
With the fists in  high
The adrenaline is running
The adrenaline is burning

All in the streets
They show rage and violence
They accuse all the abuse
They want the head of the damned

Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riotâ¦ Has begun
