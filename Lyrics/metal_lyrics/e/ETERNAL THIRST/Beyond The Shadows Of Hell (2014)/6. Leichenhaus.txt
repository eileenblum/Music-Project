[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sanchez]

"The mystery of the house of death
It's a legend that can't be broken
Scared to awake on the floor
Without return from the leichenhaus's walls"

Great fail of medicine
In Europe of the middle age
Strange vital signs
A human being will die

Old towns full of corpses
Back to life from their tombs
Really they never died
In cataleptic states they are

Leichenhaus - House of sorrow
Leichenhaus - Voices from beyond
Leichenhaus - Rotten human flesh
Leichenhaus - Maybe you're not dead

Torn and mutilated corpses
Inside a cold tomb
Loud voices from hell
Tell you about your death

The time to stop has arrived
Before false death comes
The only sign of death
Was the smell of rotten flesh

Leichenhaus - House of sorrow
Leichenhaus - Voices from beyond
Leichenhaus - Rotten human flesh
Leichenhaus - Maybe you're not dead

They raised leichenhaus
To protect living beings
Would you like to awake
And back to live again?

Leichenhaus - House of sorrow
Leichenhaus - Voices from beyond
Leichenhaus - Rotten human flesh
Leichenhaus - Maybe you're not dead
