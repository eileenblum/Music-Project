[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Alarcon]

I am here again
Why am I here again?
I am desperate
I can't leave here

Day after day I fight
Violence is my fate
Alone in this damned place
Alone here, I want to die

Day after day I dream
Violence is in my heart
Alone in this damned hell
Alone here, I want peace

Blood, pain and wickedness
My cell is a sacred place
My Only salvation
Is to be inside these four walls

Alcatraz
Floating hell
Alcatraz
Island... of steel
