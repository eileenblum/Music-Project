[Lyrics and Music by Alvarez]

Quickly in my race
Our music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams

I open my eyes and I feel metal
Itâs flowing and shaking my body
Beatings of metal give me life
My heart lives for metal

Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true

Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die

Headbangers are all together
The first riff will raise them
It will flow for all the veins
The dose of metal to live
True friendships began to grow
All passed by a single reason
This love for metal united us
Forever... To our final day

Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die

Quickly in my race
Our music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams

I open my eyes and I feel metal
Itâs flowing and shaking my body
Beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal

Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true
