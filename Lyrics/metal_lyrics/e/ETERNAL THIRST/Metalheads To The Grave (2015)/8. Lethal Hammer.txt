[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Vera]

Walking among ruins and desolation
I've met with you face to face
I can't deny my rejection for you
Fake and coward "Metalhead"

In the night
You wear black
Telling lies about your false love

Fleeing before any trouble
You will cry hidden in the dark
No words for your cowardice
In a nasty religion you hide

In the night - You wear black
Telling lies about your false love

You must die by hammer
Lethal Hammer!
You will pay your treason
Lethal Hammer!
Power of metal falls on you
Lethal Hammer!
Forged in fire and steel
Lethal Hammer!

You are a traitor of your ideals
Punishment has come to you
Everyone knows you're not worth
Metal Hammer comes for you

In the night - You wear black
Telling lies about your false love

You must die by hammer
Lethal Hammer!
You will pay your treason
Lethal Hammer!
Power of metal falls on you
Lethal Hammer!
Forged in fire and steel
Lethal Hammer!

Die by hammer
By Hammer
Pay your treason
By Hammer

Lethal
Lethal
Lethal
Lethal Hammer
Hammer
Hammer
Hammer
Lethal Hammer
