[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sanchez]

We come tonight louder than hell
Marching and Playing until you fucking die
No one can, no one can deny it
No one can, no one can stop us

Only metal in our veins
Only metal in your veins!
Every night we go to play

Your shit around us, die on the dance floor
We hate your music, we hate to fucking you
We wanna smash you, we wanna kill you
You'll wish be died, you'll see the fucking death

Only metal in our veins
Only metal in your veins!
Every night we go to play

Metal Rules the earth
Only metal veins!
Metal Rules the earth
Every night we play!
