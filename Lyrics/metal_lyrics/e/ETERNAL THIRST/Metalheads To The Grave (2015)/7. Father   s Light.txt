[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Sanchez]

I wanna fly and touch the sky tonight
To search and find my father's star
I dream this road and I feel so fine
If I could fly at your side one time

Father, guide me
I'm burning inside
Father, tell me
To live or to die

I close my eyes and here you are
I still remember every day with you
I don't wanna escape and run to nowhere
Neither to live in this world anymore

Father, guide me
I'm burning inside
Father, tell me
To live or to die

I look into the mist
We're united by this pain
Where my father's light shines
Together we'll be there

I wonder where we'll reunite us
No contemplations I know I have to do
Until the last breath
I'll wish to be at your side
Into the unknown
We'll see us again... forever

Father, guide me
I'm burning inside
Father, tell me
To live or to die

I look into the mist
We're united by this pain
Where my father's light shines
Together we'll be there

Father, guide me
I'm burning inside
Father, tell me
To live or to die
