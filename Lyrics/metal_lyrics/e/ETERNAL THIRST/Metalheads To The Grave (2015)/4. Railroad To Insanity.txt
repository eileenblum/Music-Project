[Lyrics and Music by Alvarez]

Destroying all on my way
I'm walking without sense
Running away from the unknown
I'm going to an unreal fate

I've started to hear voices
I don't know from it's coming
Loud voices are trying control me
And now I'm facing them restless

Unreal Reality - Confuse Clarity
Evil Legacy - A Fatal Fantasy

Unreal!

Railroad to insanity
Long road of desperation
Pieces of reality
A fragile mind will die

Railroad to insanity
Long road of desperation
Pieces of reality
Helpless from the value clarity

I've followed those evil voices
Through the paths of twisted madness
Never I have seen before
This darkness that slowly absorbs me

Every second is a gift and a curse
I don't wanna go and on and on
Stand alone is the better way
To my life soon come to an end

Unreal Reality
Confuse Clarity
Evil Legacy
A Fatal Fantasy

Unreal!

Railroad to insanity
Long road of desperation
Pieces of reality
A fragile mind will die
Railroad to insanity
Long road of desperation
Pieces of reality
Helpless from the value clarity

Unreal
Unreal Clarity!

Railroad to insanity ...
