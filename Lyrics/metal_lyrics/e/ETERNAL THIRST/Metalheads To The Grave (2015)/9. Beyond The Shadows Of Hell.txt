[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Bustos/Alvarez/Alarcon]

You're surrounded by evil acts
Crazy news and bloody hands
The sign of death prowl for you
The unholy words are true

Malign powers of evil sign
Live all over the land
Beyond the shadows of hell
You'll live by the evil grace

Feel the deepest fear
Don't run shedding tears
Feel the deepest fear
Beyond the shadows of hell

Every day you hear of war
Every day you hear of pain
People want to be the best
To any price and restless

Femicide and homicide
Social decay by lies
Violence and suicide
One by one we will die

Feel the deepest fear
Don't run shedding tears
Feel the deepest fear
Beyond the shadows of hell

Afraid to walk on the streets
In the night I hear your screams
The end of humanity is near
Your god will fall by his fear
