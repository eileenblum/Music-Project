[Lyrics by Alvarez and Music by Alarcon]

"Last night I had a dream,
More well, was a nightmare
That's became reality...The harsh reality
I return to the darkness of my life
And the solitude embraces me again"

I am weak into the darkness
I'm walking like soulless
Dreaming with the future
Remember is a torture

I live paying the price
I'm hidden in the vice
Suicide is not my choice
Every day I hear its voice

Death Cross!
Killing demons from my past
I will keep myself alive
Deathcross!
My will won't be broken again

My change is the only way
I face the vice, I'm against the vice
I see the shine of the day
To my past I'll leave behind

Now I walk full of pride
I live better than before
Never is too late for change
Why did not I change before?

Death Cross!
Killing demons from my past
I will keep myself alive
Death Cross!
My will won't be broken again

Death Cross!
Killing demons from my past
I will keep myself alive
Death Cross!
My will won't be broken again
