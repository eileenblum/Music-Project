[Lyrics by H. Alvarez &amp; Music by J. Alarcon]

I have the power and force
I have a place injured in my soul
My dreams are like the fire
My dreams devastate all in their road

Destroying and devastating
Doesnât matter to me the pain that caused
I feel as my own fire burns me
My only worry is to fight steel with steel

Our projects and illusions
Our families and lives
They are in a latent danger
Each second of life to be the last

Power of fire
You burn our lives
Power of fire
You fight with the steel

Our projects and illusions
Our families and lives
They are in a latent danger
Each second of life to be the last

Power of fire
You burn our lives
Power of fire
You fight with the steel

Power
Power
Power
Of fire
