[Lyrics &amp; Music by H. Alvarez]

Quickly in my race
The music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams

I open my eyes and I feel metal
Flow all the veins of my body
The beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal

Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true

Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die

The headbangers are all together
The first riff will raise them
Will flow for all the veins
The dose of metal to live

True friendships began to grow
All met by a single reason
The love to metal united us
Forever, to our final day

Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die

Quickly in my race
The music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams

I open my eyes and I feel metal
Flow all the veins of my body
The beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal

Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true
