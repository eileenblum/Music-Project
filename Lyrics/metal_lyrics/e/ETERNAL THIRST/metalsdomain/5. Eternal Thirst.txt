[Lyrics by H. Alvarez &amp; Music by M. Sandoval / J. Alarcon / H. Sanchez / H. Alvarez]

The world day by day is worse
The power gives them the advantage
They satisfy the thirst of wickedness
They satisfy the thirst of impunity

They are damned murderers and lying
All the corruption they should hide
The damned impunity will always exist?
And the politics is overshadowed

[Chorus:]
Thirst â eternal thirst â eternal thirst
Thirst â eternal thirst â eternal thirst

We are them affected same old
The violence continues exploting
The bloody wars will enjoy
We continue without hope in darkness

The faith that nobody will save
The divine images will be dispelled
The fight against evil will begin
The world scandal will explode

[Chorus:]
Thirst â eternal thirst â eternal thirst
Thirst â eternal thirst â eternal thirst
