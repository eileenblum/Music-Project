[Lyrics by H. Alvarez &amp; Music by J. Alarcon]

His soul is full of revenge
The pain drove him crazy
With his axe in hand
He will destroy you quickly

He lives hidden in darkness
Nobody knows when he will attack
The hatred doesnât leave him to see
He attacks without mercy

If he traps you are lost
Because he is the skull breaker
The murderers of his family
They walk along the streets
Without knowing who waits
Sooner or later will find them

He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not

The insanity says him that is a play
A bloody and macabre play
Will he continue killing people?
Will he continue breaking skulls?

He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
