[sample: "Get off my case, motherfucker."]

The sun burns in the stranger's eyes
Just one tear before he dies
Black mass can't ease the pain
There's nothing here, there's nothing sane

I hope this fuckin' world fuckin' burns away
And I'd kill you all if I had my way
But I'll live forever, questions curse me why
Oh Lord above, why won't you let me die
