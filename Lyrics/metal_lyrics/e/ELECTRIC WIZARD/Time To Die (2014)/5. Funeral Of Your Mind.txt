Your burnt and twisted mind is to blame
The lies a coffin for your brain
Your future now rots away
Cos it's your funeral every day

It's the Funeral Of Your Mind
It's the Funeral Of Your Mind
Lost and self-deceived you'll never find
It's the Funeral Of Your Mind

All your friends (ha ha) say you're insane
But you don't need them anyway
It's the Funeral Of Your Mind
As your future rots away
It's the Funeral Of Your Mind

You never fucking listened anyway
Now you realise it's too late
We had all the answers you can't find
It's the Funeral Of Your Mind
....Funeral Of Your Mind
The Funeral Of Your Mind
The Funeral Of Your Mind
The Funeral Of Your Mind
