You say drugs are evil
But your world seems worse to me
I don't give a fuck about anyone
Or your society. I just need

Incense for the Damned
Our lives are condemned
Incense for the Damned
Our lives are condemned anyway...

Marijuana burns inside my crypt
High up here I don't need to take your shit
You people try to bring us down
But soon you'll all be chocking on
Incense for the Damned

I wanna get high before I die
I wanna get high before I die, I wanna die....
Like Caligula is how I would treat this world if it were mine...
But this world has no love for me
A useless freak, turn your back to society....
We wanna get high before we die
We wanna get high before we die
We wanna die...I wanna die
