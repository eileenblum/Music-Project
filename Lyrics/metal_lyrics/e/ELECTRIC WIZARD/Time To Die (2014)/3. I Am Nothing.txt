Stillborn children. Saturnâs children the living dead
We have created this abyss, darkness, surrounding us
Raise the flag of hate against this human race
Rise and kill &amp; wipe them all awayâ¦.

I Am Nothing
I Mean Nothing
I See Nothing
I Feel Nothingâ¦as I kill you

We the Old Ones did not forget
We are the Supercoven, we wait with bated breath
They think themselves as Gods ..now are they free?
Mindless slaves to their lusts and technology

I Am Nothing
I Mean Nothing
I See Nothing
I Feel Nothingâ¦.as I kill you

I Am Nothing
I Feel Nothing
I Am Nothing
You Are Nothingâ¦.
To Meâ¦
Nothingâ¦
Nothingâ¦
I Feel Nothing as I kill youâ¦..
