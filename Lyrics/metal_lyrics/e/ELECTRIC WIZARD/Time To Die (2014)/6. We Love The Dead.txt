I creep amongst the graves and crypts
I love the dead, the living make me sick
Profit &amp; greed, bleeding the world dry
You laugh at me but when you die......
You will be mine......

We love the dead, dead eyes can't disguise
We love the dead, no more lies....or deceit
The living betrayed me I only trust the dead
In your tomb now my vengeance spreads.....

We Love The Dead
We trust the dead
We are the dead
When will you die too...?

I'll leave black flowers on your grave....
