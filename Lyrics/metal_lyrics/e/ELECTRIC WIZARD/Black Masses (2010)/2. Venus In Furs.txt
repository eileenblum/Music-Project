I am the Zodiac, I am the stars,
You are the sorceress, my priestess of Mars,
Queen of the night, swathed in satin black,
Your ivory flesh upon my torture rack.

My Venus in Furs.

To your leather boots, I offer prayer,
You rise like a cobra, evil dressed in furs,
But your venom, a black drug inside my veins,
I need it everyday to take away the pain.

My Venus in Furs.

I am Zodiac, I am the Stars, You are the Sorceress, Venus in Furs.

I am the Zodiac.
