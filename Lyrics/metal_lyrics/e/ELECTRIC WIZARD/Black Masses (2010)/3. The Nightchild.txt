Under the black sun I crawl from my grave,
Your body I worship, Your blood I crave.
I creep by your window, The light I despise
You cannot see me but feel my cold eyes.

I am the Nightchild,
Shadows gather round me.
Are you a Nightchild?
Join us and be free.

Your rotten world means nothing to me,
Undercover of darkness is when I am free.
The Nightchild is creeping, forever seeking,
New bodies new victims, drug and murder addicted.
