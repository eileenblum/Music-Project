Black sun master
Under starless sky
Black stone altar
They pray to the sign
The old ones were
And they shall be again
Yog Sothoth is the gate
Planetary alignment predicts their reign

Supercoven
Have awakened the Ancient Ones
Mindless slaves to the black god
Moan dark hymns to the sun
To the sun

Mindless fuckin' slaves
You're mindless slaves

They watch from the sun
Since our lives had begun
They want us to be free
If only we could see

Yeah! Turn to the sun...

Supercoven...
