under saturns rays I rest in eternal sleep dopesmoke violates my tomb and awakens me
clawing from the grave my batwings spread
their blood filled with drugs, so high, so dead

your dope laced blood shows me new highs
bloodlust, druglust, count drugula arise...

strung out on blood I hunt the streets at night
terror from the sky, in batform I strike
your naked body dragged to my darkened crypt
I tie you up, dope you up then your blood I sip

drugula.....
