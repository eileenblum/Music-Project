[sample: "You see man as a rather dismal creature." "Yes. Why not? Look around...]
[you'll see what's there. Fear, and frightened people who kill what they can't understand."]

A seed of hate from the day I was born
My right to vengeance from me has been torn
Hopeless and drugged, my black emotions seethe
Loveless and cold, my hate begins to breed

Black nebula, seething in my brain
Then your fucking world brings me down again
So I'll take my father's gun and I'll walk down to the street
I'll have my vengeance now with everyone I meet, yeah

A seed of hate from the day I was born
My right to vengeance from me has been torn
Hopeless and drugged, my black emotions seethe
Loveless and cold, my hate begins to breed, yeah

We hate you
We hate you
We hate you
We hate you
We hate you
