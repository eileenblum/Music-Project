[2006 re-release bonus]

Poison clouds in the sky
Acid rain in my eyes
Starving children of my TV
Victims of technology

Politicians, can't they see
Their greed is destroying me
Politicians, are they blind
Time's run out for mankind

Devil plunges into the sun
Things were said but nothing done
Now too late, can't you see
Human race wants their disease
