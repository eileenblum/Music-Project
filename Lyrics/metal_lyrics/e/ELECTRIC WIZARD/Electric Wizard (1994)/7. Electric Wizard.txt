One day we were sitting and wondering where it's at
When down came a dragon with a wizard on his back
He said to us, step up, wanna take you for a trip
Then up we flew off into space and the astral gates we slipped
Alright

Looking back behind us, to the freaks and heads we wave
And off beyond our system out until they're deep in space
And on the edge of time and space there stood two towers black
But on we flew, the wizard knew there was no turning back
Cast your spell on me

Higher and higher, through the cosmos we had tripped
Seeing stars turned inside out, we thought our minds had flipped
Colors swirling, sounds are drifting, thinking we were dead
The wizard turned and spoke to us and, this is what he said

Through the virgin universe, upon his back we played
Creating and destroying with the music we made
Undulate the cosmic rhythm, galaxies were born
Clouds of blue, fluorescent dunes, spreading out before
Yeah
