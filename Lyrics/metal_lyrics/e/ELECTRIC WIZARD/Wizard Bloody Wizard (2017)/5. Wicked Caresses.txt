They light black candles
A chant begins
Inside her coffin
She spreads her wings

Her wicked caresses
and obscene kissesâ¦

Her serpent body writhes
Dead eyes now open wide
My senses numbed by vices
Submerging in her darkness

Her icy touch enslaves my soul
I need her evil but sheâs so cold

Your cold, so evil
Iâm lost, I need you
â
