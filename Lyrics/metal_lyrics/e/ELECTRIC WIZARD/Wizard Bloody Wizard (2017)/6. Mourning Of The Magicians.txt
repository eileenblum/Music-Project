Distorted shadows scream
As Saturn's children dream

Faded colours bleed
I can see you don't believe

Come together
And feel it now
Goodbye, farewell
I'll see you in hell

Lost children come to me
We have the answers that you seek
I know it's been to long
But at last the light has come

The hunters now
Become the hunted
Here's the darkness
That you always wanted

Your gods are dragged
Beneath you and crucified
Now you have everything
But everything has died

So come together
And feel it now
Goodbye, farewell
I'll see you in hell

Distorted shadows scream
As Saturn's children dream

Faded colours bleed
I can see you don't believe

Come together
And feel it now
Goodbye, farewell
I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell

Lost children come to me
We have the answers that you seek
I know it's been to long
But at last the light has come
As you die
