I'm so cold inside
My feelings petrified
Your torturous screams
Mean nothing to me

This dying world gasps its last breath as we turn off our minds
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die, die

I need something to fix the pain
Baby, baby, please stick the needle in
Then I'll be dead and blue
Just like you

This dying world gasps its last breath as we turn off our minds
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die, die

They're still haunting me
I know I'll never be free
Lucifer, my only friend
I'll burn in Hell to the end, yeah!

I'm so dead inside
Wishing I could die
Your torturous screams
Still haunt my dreams

This dying world gasps its last breath as we turn off our minds
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die, die

This world is crazy and makes me sick
Yeah, baby, I tortured you just for kicks
But I lie here obsessed by evil
Forever a servant of the Devil
