We love your virgin blood
Death is our drug
Shadows, we hunt the streets
High on your screams

Cos she lovesâ¦
Necromania, death her pleasure

Cos she lovesâ¦
Necromania, black whips of leather
Funeral shadows, dark hooded figures

We rise from the tomb
Your flesh is our doom
Screaming, chained in our crypt
Too late, you canât resist

At last, so sweet, so dead
We drink your final breath
Torture, bloodlust &amp; pain
We need to kill again

Pleasures of darkness
Youâll soon be screaming
Funeral shadows
At night a creepingâ¦
