Dethroned emperors
Hatred our creed
Knights of fuzz riding
On blackened steeds

Hear the sirens scream
Theyâre calling, calling for me

This doomed sermon
Praises all who fail
Black robed disciples
And angels from hell

We are the night
We hate the light
We have no future
We are the doomed
Drugs our religion
Violence our hymn
Killing for freedom
Then the sirens scream again

Can you hear them screaming?

The song of the sirens
Tormenting my mind
All of our pleasures
Are now a crime

Can you hear them screaming?
Theyâre screaming, screaming for me
