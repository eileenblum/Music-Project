Earth torn from it's path by meteoric pass,
Showered by debris,
Continents crumble, our cities funeral pyres,
Crash into the sea.

The sun has turned to black,
No turning back,
They hide amongst the stars and wait....

Reaper's shadow cast across the aftermath,
We cannot escape,
Everlasting night, return to pagan rites,
The old ones rule supreme.
