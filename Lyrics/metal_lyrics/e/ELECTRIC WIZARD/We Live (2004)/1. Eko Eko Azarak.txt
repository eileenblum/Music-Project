Black pyramids under martian sun,
Priests chant ancient necropsalms,
Summon winds across the desert sands,
Sun sets on this dying land.

Lamac lamac Bachalyas
Cabahagy sabalyos

Black ships tear through martian skies,
Earthbound send by sorcerous flight,
13 years through black depths of space,
Ancient race seed this cursed place.

Lagoz atha cabyolas
Samahac atha famolas

Come my fanatics, come to the sabbath....
Come my fanatics, come to the sabbath, yeah!
