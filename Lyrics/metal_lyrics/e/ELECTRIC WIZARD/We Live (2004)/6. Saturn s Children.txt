Crucified by the sun,
In the shadow of the iron cross,
Saturn's children come,
Invoke the supercoven.

Many armed we strike,
Like wolves in the night,
And the cross turns to black....

And the children of the sun,
Know their time has come,
Give up the fight, slip back into the night....

Turn off your mind, there's nothing to find....
Find out here....
