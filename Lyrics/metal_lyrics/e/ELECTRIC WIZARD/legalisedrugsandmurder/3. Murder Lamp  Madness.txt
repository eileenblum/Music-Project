I hear the night calling it knows my name,
I hear the night screaming summoned again.
My need, my lust for vengeance, black wings of hate,
My wrath at last has reason, legions awake!

And when the night calls,
We rise, we kill.
Our covens grow in darkness,
Nurtured by weed and pills.

Rise, rise,
Legions of hatred.
Rise, rise,
Legions of hatred.
