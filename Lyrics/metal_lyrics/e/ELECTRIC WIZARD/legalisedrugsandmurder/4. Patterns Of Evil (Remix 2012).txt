Rituals of Evil,
In dungeons dressed in black.
Screaming virgins tortured,
Dragged to the Devil's altar.

Whipped tortured,
Our ritual has begun.
Witches Sabbat,
All good will be undone.
Patterns of Evil, 
Whip marks across my flesh.
Evil witchcraft,
Disciples of death.

Narcotic chanting,
Female screams fill the crypts.
Naked witches writhing,
They offer obscene kiss.

Patterns of Evil,
Casting shadows.
Patterns of Evil,
Forever in my mind.
