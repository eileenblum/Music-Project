[lyrics-Dave]

Deep in the bowels of the ocean
tge monsters play
Crimson tide from soldiers
in their watery graves
Food of the gods, you're surrounded by a gul-
lined tomb

There's more room - You see the eye and
you've sealed your doom
The Architeuthis - A giant ruthless! - The dark
side of the crimson tide

You can't hide - Prepare to die!

Carnivore of ancient horror and sailors lore
from bay to bay
Thrashing gore - Blood red sea floor - Can't
take no more -
Let's fucking party!
Food of the gods, digest in the invertebrates
womb

There's more room - You see the eye and
you've sealed your doom
The Architeuthis - A giant ruthless! - The dark
side of the crimson tide

You can't hide - Prepare to die!

Sea demon - In season -
I'm screamin'! - No reason

Sea is black with ink - Staring in it's eye
Ripping monster beak -
Chomping on my thigh
Thrash arms around -
Soon I will be dead
20,000 leagues crushing overhead!

Sea demon - In season - I'm screamin'! - No
reason
Infection - Not to mention -
Chaotic evolution!

Massive tentacles
wrapped around the beast
Hulking metal beasts in battle ships we'll... feast

...ARCHITEUTHIS!
