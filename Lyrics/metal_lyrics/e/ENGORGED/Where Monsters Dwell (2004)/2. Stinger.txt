[lyrics-Ryan]

From darkest space,
across the void, he has arrived
Invasion front, a bounty huny,
you won't survive
Relentlessly,
he stalks his prey, mercilessly
In his path? He'll take you down,
underground...

My name is Stinger! I get respect, your planet
and your lives are what I expect
My thrashing metal is bullet proof. your
primitive weapons are of no use

Energy field, imprisons you,
there's no escape
Conquering, taking the dead,
re-animate
They come for you,
the rotting horrors you once knew
Shifting shappe, twisting flesh, I've picked their
minds...

My name is Stinger!
Feared throughout galaxies
Ill take my prisoner
and destroy all I see
Surrender now, you can't resist
Earth now belongs to the House of Fists!
[mosh part]
My invasion force awaits
but a parsec away
With one word from me,
they'll be here in a day
To turn your cities to rubble,
stip your recources dry
Slag this planet and leave you all to die

Retrofit - The living dead - Send them to hunt

I await my vistory
from my dark tower high
Super science awaits you
once you have died
Light years advanced
I am a killer supreme
Command planet crushing armies of bionic,
fiends

Collossal worm eighty feet long
Earth will shake and open up
Swallow you whole metallic hulk
It's stinger poised and venom dripping

Burrowing beneath to attack
Pull you down and make you a snack
He's here and he's not friendly...
READY TO KILL!
