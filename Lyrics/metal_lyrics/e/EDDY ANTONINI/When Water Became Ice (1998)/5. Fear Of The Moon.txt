[Testi: Eddy Antonini]

Black is the sky in a summer hot evening.
A young man walks fast in the streets of the City-dream.
He looks upon his head to forget his life
but he sees the biggest mistake of mankind.

The moon is hungry, wanna destroy human race.
Corruption and bullshits can't live in Universe.
She wants to fight the evil, she wants to kill the evil
but the evil is even mankind.

If you wanna save your life
to laugh again and cry
you have to believe in the light of the moon.

Fear of the moon, red is the moon
against your mind, against your soul.
Light in the dark, fire in the sky
you cannot run away.
Power of red moon is here.

If you believe in the Justice of red moon
then let her save you, take time she is offering to you.
She wants to fight the evil, she wants to kill the evil
but the evil is even mankind.

If you wanna save your life
to laugh again and cry
you have to believe in the light of the moon.

Fear of the moon, red is the moon
against your mind, against your soul.
Light in the dark, fire in the sky
you cannot run away.
Power of red moon is here.

Fear of the moon, red is the moon
against your mind, against your soul.
Light in the dark, fire in the sky
you cannot run away.
Power of red moon is here.

Power of red moon is here.
