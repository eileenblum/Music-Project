[Musica: Eddy Antonini e Roberto Potenti]
[Testi: Eddy Antonini]

In the darkest night demons came to take me away.
Addicted to the pleasure, masters of our souls.
Dragged into the dark, they decided to show the damage.
Just a little sign arised: water became ice.

Never return to forget what he is burning in that night of fear.
Some drops of pleasure explode on your face and now... are tears.

A lonely man with hate inside
another whisky to drink his life.
Around his head, the pain will shine...
He cried! And water became ice.

When water became ice.

Never return to forget what he is burning in that night of fear.
Some drops of pleasure explode on your face and now... are tears.

A lonely man with hate inside
another whisky to drink his life.
Around his head, the pain will shine...
He cried! And water became ice.

When water became ice.
