Angels cry, demons die
black night comes above my room.
Trying to find a feeling blind
an helping hand to drive my doom.
An iced tear, a little fear
a lonely heart that beats inside.
A simple pray, a mortal race
to win this love to save my pride.

This time I have to remember the meaning of the truth
searching for a shelter where hide my love for you
but looking at the mirror I can only see your face
I'm captured by the darkness while you are walking away.

I'd give my life to find you
to meet and touch your heart
coming out from darkness
but Destiny might tear us apart
I'm dreaming now I hold you
and kiss your lips goodnight
staring at the sweetest
things you've got...

... YOUR EYES.
