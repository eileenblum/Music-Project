Sun that burn my day is coming now
soldier sends his pray to save our time.
Like a child in the night
like a bat in the light you are coming to steal all my secrets.
I'm a whisper that flies
since your ice became blind
I can't stand you
but I won't face your soul.

Take your disguise
send your song and pray
live and let die
start to play the game.

When you cry, I'll cry
when you scream, I'll scream
when you lose
I'll stay with you to let you win.
When you feel the pain
when you scream my name
I will be the keeper of your dreams.

Sun that light our day is coming now
and I'll send my pray towards the light.
Like a rainbow in the dark
like a beat of my heart you are coming to kill me again.
I'm a bird without wings
but I need your sweet dreams
now my life really depends on you.

Walking in the dark
I'm going to give my life to you
please let me start
and I will show the truth.

When you cry, I'll cry
when you scream, I'll scream
when you lose
I'll stay with you to let you win.
When you feel the pain
when you scream my name
I will be the keeper of your dreams.

Are you crying?
We will rise!
Are you lonesome?
We will come!
Don't be afraid the stars are fighting
WINNER IS THE SUN.

Don't be afraid the stars are fighting
WINNER IS THE SUN.

Are you crying?
We will rise!
Are you lonesome?
We will come!
Don't be afraid the stars are fighting
WINNER IS THE SUN.

Don't be afraid the stars are fighting
WINNER IS THE SUN.

Lord I'll send my prayer
I'm wasting my time
don't walk the streets of pain
shall I bring back your mind?
... I'll take another day.
