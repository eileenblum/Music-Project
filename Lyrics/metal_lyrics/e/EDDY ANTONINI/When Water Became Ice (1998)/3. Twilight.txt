[Testi: Eddy Antonini]

Take me away to the sign of the twilight
heal my soul where the angels can let it grow.
Don't forget
take a look through this darkness
'cause our sun cannot shine anymore.

Send our prayer on the way of illusions
I will capture the Lucifer's gold.
Trying to save
free your mind from confusion
reaching hard the white light of the sun.

We live to fight this danger climbing under the God eyes
the legend of the saviors never dies.
We live to fight this danger just above the evil gold
the treasure of mankind is our love.

Higher and higher
we are crossing the sky;
higher and higher
our wings now can fly;
higher and higher
we don't wanna fall.
Searching for the key of our love
until... THE TWILIGHT COMES.

Blow me away to the sign of the twilight
search for what all the angels need to grow.
Turn your tears into a beautiful nightmare
'cause we all steal the Lucifer's gold.

Human race can't survive without twilight
human souls are the arms of the gods
my desire is the key of the twilight
and all my thoughts are running straight to the sun.

We live to fight this danger climbing under the God eyes
the legend of the saviors never dies.
We live to fight this danger just above the evil gold
the treasure of mankind is our love.

Higher and higher
we are crossing the sky;
higher and higher
our wings now can fly;
higher and higher
we don't wanna fall.
Searching for the key of our love
until... THE TWILIGHT COMES.
