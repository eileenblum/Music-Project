They were told to follow the Star of David
To whatever it would take them
But did they know a voice from god
Could cause such fucking mayhem
A pissed shepherd, a virgin birth
The Immaculate Conception
Yet in this day they still believe
This bullshitting deception

Time will tell but time wonât wait
For your useless benediction
Itâs up to you, make up your mind
Is it fact of fucking fiction?

Kids at school get it drummed in their heads
That Jesus loves you all
So what do you tell them
When someone dies
Why Jesus did fuck all

Time will tell but time wonât wait
For your useless benediction
Itâs up to you, make up your mind
Is it fact of fucking fiction?

They were told to follow the Star of David
To whatever it would take them
But did they know a voice from god
Could cause such fucking mayhem
A pissed shepherd, a virgin birth
The Immaculate Conception
Yet in this day they still believe
This bullshitting deception
