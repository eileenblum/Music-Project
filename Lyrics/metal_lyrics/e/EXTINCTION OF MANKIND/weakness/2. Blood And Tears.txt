Wave goodbye to daddy
Heâs away to fight the war
Another year of waiting
To see if he returns
Gathered round the TV-screen
The news has just come in
That allied troops have landed
And theyâre ready to begin
Theyâre marching to the front line
Where the killing has begun
Another day of slaughter
Beneath a blood red sun

Another massive death count
Billions spent on arms
As genocidal bastards
Control the murder farms

Bodies littered at the side of the road
Individually numbered for the flight back home
Back on the tarmac the widows in black
The tattered corpses have been flown back
Identification is gruesome and grim
Only the dog tags tell you itâs him

Another massive death count
Billions spent on arms
As genocidal bastards
Control the murder farms
