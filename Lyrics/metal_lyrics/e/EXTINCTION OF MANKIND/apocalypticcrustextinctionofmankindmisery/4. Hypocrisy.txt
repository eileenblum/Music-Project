[performed by Extinction of Mankind]Won't be a lamb to the slaughter, why should it be so
I won't be judged by the seeds you sow
Mankind's will is the strength of the free
This is how it was and shall always be

Not blinded by hypocrisy
Nor blinded by your lies

Like a flower, picked and discarded
Lies faith, withered and retarded
Fear is a tool, a weapon to rule
Control for the weak, a crutch for the fouled

Not blinded by hypocrisy
Nor blinded by your lies

Where's the hope in your eyes when you see the lie
Misplaced faith and the price is too high
Denied yourself pleasures waiting for a reward
This is all a lie and your a victim of fraud
