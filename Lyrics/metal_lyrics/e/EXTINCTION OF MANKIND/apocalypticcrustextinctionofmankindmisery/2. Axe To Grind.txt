[performed by Extinction of Mankind]Prophet of doom in a world gone bad
Can we change a future we've not yet had
Millennium fever grips our nation by the throat
Gone are the days of freedom, peace and hope

With an axe to grind we have no more time
In a struggle to rid mankind of his crimes

Comatose future blocking out the sun
Force fed the darkness, nowhere to run
At the edge of the end the madness reigns
And the message of horror spreads through our brains

With an axe to grind we have no more time
In a struggle to rid mankind of his crimes

Running like stray dogs no directions
While others lie bleeding from recent infections
To satisfy a prophet we step into its way
When all we really need to do is change
