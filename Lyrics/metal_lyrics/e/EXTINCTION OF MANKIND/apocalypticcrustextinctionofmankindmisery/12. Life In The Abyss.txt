[performed by Extinction of Mankind &amp; Misery]Never seeing the light in our struggle to exist
Values ripped asunder and
There's nothing more than this
Target to love while we are torn apart again
Hearts split in two as we seek
Respite from our pain
Disembodied laughter cuts us like a knife
Still we crawl like dogs
In the abyss called life

Always to crush us when mistakes are made
Childhood illusions
Suppressed and fade
Promises or lies from the ones I've hold dear
Anger and rage when
Betrayal come clear
Movements betray we're part of the masquerade
And we're damned by the choices
We have made

This is the truth behind the dark abyss
Nothing new, nothing else
Nothing more than this
A moment of happiness a little ground to gain
See it snatched away
To see them in your way again
Leaving you with mistrust there is no more than this
You'll crawl on your own
Through life's abyss
