[performed by Extinction of Mankind]Eat this you bastard while you shit on the poor
We've taken this for too long and we can't take no more
When everyday is a burden designed to break our will
Eat this you fucking scum it's you we've come to kill

When you rain misery and violence
From out of the blue
Remember it'll only take on bullet
To stop you

Go to get off our knees and move in now
Don't worry about their laws
And the things they won't allow
true anarchy isn't peaceful and serene
It's a road paved with blood
No peaceful happy dream
