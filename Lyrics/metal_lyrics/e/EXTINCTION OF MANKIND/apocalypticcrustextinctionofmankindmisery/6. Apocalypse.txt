[performed by Extinction of Mankind]A new dawn approaching
On the winds of the dead
Over countless battlefields
Where the Earth is stained red
Wolves prowl amongst the sheep
The humans are led
To the slaughterhouse of warfare
Hung up and bled

The sun turns black in its final eclipse
It's the dawn of the end
Are you ready for this

The gods have stopped watching
Mankind the government and rules
Written in stone
The first battle has ended
No one has won
No ground has been gathered
For all the deeds done

The sun turns black in its final eclipse
It's the dawn of the end
Are you ready for this

Blood rain hails upon us
In the stench of decay
Held back by their forces
We'll pray for this day
Your heroes have died
Now none can remain
All torn on the battlefields
Ravens feast on the slain

The sun turns black in its final eclipse
It's the dawn of the end
Are you ready for this

Earth can now rest safely
No thorns upon it's rose
The chapter called mankind
Has come to a close
And if evolution can show
A peaceful face
Then maybe Earth's history
Can forget
This wretched human race
