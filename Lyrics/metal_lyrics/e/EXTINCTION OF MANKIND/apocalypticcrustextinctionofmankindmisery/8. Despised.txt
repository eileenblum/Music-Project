[performed by Extinction of Mankind]You look at me as if I don't belong
It's the scum like you that are doing wrong
You knock us to the ground with you state oppression
Then cry for help when we turn to aggression

I refuse to believe your misconceived bullshit
I'm tired of slaving for their behalf
What you do for others you must expect the same
Because it's bastards like you
That can't face the blame

Rub the shit from your eyes
Because that reflection in the mirror
Is what we despise
