A global state of desperation
We live in a cesspit of humiliation
Death tolls rise and bodies burn
Who can tell when the tide will turn?
Time to search for some solution
Save our future from mass pollution

With soil full of toxins and oceans of oil
Every breath taken can make your blood boil
Each new conception for ultimate power
Knocks down our lifespan hour by hour
There's only one winner, nature herself
She'll wipe-out mankind from his shelf

You only get one chance on this planet Earth
A lifetime of choices to see what your worth
Man suffocates itself in frenzied ambition
A once fertile planet will succumb to submission
Who will bear witness when man breathes its last?
No proof of existence, no history, no past
