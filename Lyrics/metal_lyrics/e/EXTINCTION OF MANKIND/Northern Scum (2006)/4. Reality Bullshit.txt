Reality TV ain't for me
Your arse on show for the world to see
Pathetic lives on a sterile set
Reality? Ha! You wanna bet

No imagination, your minds are numb
Taking this for reality is fucking dumb
Should we expect more from humanity?
You refuse to wake up to real reality

In zombie mode you sit and stare
A land of make-believe but you don't dare
Are you really bored this is all you can do?
Watch some cunt talk shit for you

Suicide bombers in bits on the street
Children maimed, while others look for food to eat
War raging on, it's all there for you to see
But you'd rather sit back and watch your TV

Your sense numb, eyes covered to see
But everything's fine as long as you can see
Celebrity idiots paraded on the screen
You'll never see reality and that's obscene

In zombie mode you sit and stare
A land of make-believe but you don't dare
Are you really bored this is all you can do?
Watch some cunt talk shit for you
