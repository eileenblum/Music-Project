Political bullshit filled with fear and lies
Create a realm of terror, another race despised
For glory, for honor, you match in and die
How many more me will die for this lie?

And the world it waits with bait breath
For the next onslaught of senseless death

Thousands are slaughtered for someone's bank balance
Lives are measures by dollars and pounds
For victory, for God, for oil they die
Bombed, shot, dying under a foreign sky

And the world it waits with baited breath
For the next onslaught of senseless death
