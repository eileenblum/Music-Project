For every single one of us
There is a time to die
From infancy to dotage
We learn to say goodbye

Looking back with anger
Only leads to regrets
There is a future waiting
That's what you forget

We keep the home fires burning
We wake each different day
But keep down in our hearts
We know time ticks away

Looking back with anger
Only leads to regrets
There is a future waiting
That's what you forget

Live your life for each day
Don't dwell on your past
Make your mark on today
'Cause tomorrow may be your last

Looking back with anger
Only leads to regrets
There is a future waiting
That's what you forget
