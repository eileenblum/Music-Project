When Ratzinger came marching in
He'll make you confess your sins
The Hitler youth has taught him well
How to make you kneel and pay

Herr Ratzinger, Herr Ratzinger
The Nazi pope has come
He's got himself some human soup
To wash away the scum

The non-Catholic despots will disappear to camp
You find yourself one day walking up the ramp
His SS Catholic army plot behind doors
Religious fascism will be the new cause

Herr Ratzinger, Herr Ratzinger
The Nazi pope has come
He's got himself some human soup
To wash away the scum

The inquisition kicks in your door
Blackshirted priest, new holy war
Believe the word you heathen scum
In the dead of night for you we'll come

Herr Ratzinger, Herr Ratzinger
The Nazi pope has come
He's got himself some human soup
To wash away the scum

No mercy for the wretched
No mercy for the meek
Mother Mary wears a swastika
She's hunting the weak

Herr Ratzinger, Herr Ratzinger
The Nazi pope has come
He's got himself some human soup
To wash away the scum
