I spy with my little eye
Fly on the wall, pie in the sky
Who gave a fuck who's bedding who?
What dress she wears for her film preview

Multimedia at its best
Their fame is your fortune so fuck the rest

The elements claim thousands of lives
But airtime is given to celebrities' wives
'Cause Posh is up the duff again
Fuck the dead, the maimed, the slain

Multimedia at its best
Their fame is your fortune so fuck the rest

Can't have mere mortals wasting space
When Kate's on coke and off her face
The soaps and stars are all that counts
No primetime when disaster mounts

Multimedia at its best
Their fame is your fortune so fuck the rest
