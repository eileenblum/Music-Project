The beast he walks the streets
Just looking for a thrill
he spots her walking all alone
He goes in for the kill
Left there raped and murdered
Thank God she'll never know
How? It's not his first time
'Cause he's done it before

if they've done it once
They will do it again
Again and again

Spent some time in re-hab
A few years then he's free
Is the government so stupid?
Can't they use their eyes and see
Life should mean forever
With no chance of reprieve
Those victims are a long time dead
So let their families grieve

If they've done it once
They will do it again
Again and again
