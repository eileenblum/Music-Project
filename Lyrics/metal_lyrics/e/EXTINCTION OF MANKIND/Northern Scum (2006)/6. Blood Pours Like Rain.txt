We listen to Blair and Bush's lies
In the Promised Land whole worlds die
Another disillusioned day has past
How long will all this torment last?

Deceit and pain, blood pours like rain
Blood pours like rain

No longer the land of milk and honey
We live in a world of lies and money
You pick on the weak to feed the strong
It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong

Deceit and pain, blood pours like rain
Blood pours like rain
