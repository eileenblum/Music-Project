You don't want to be inside my brain
You can never see how sad and insane

When people stare at you, what can that be?
Do you feel how I feel, when you're looking at me?

Can't stop the conspiracies, the whispers wipe me out
Can't keep popping sedatives, I want to scream and shout

Don't know how you know me, or what I've done so bad
Can't think why you hate me, when it's you that's fucking mad
