[performed by Extinction of Mankind]Another lost soul with a gun in his hand
On a mission to kill he makes his stand

A gun culture freak with no license to kill
He picks out his prey and gets his cheap thrill

Baby-faced gangsters with weapons of pride
No right to bear arms, too many have died

In a pool of blood the victim(s) lie(s) dead
A gunshot trauma to the fuckinâ head
