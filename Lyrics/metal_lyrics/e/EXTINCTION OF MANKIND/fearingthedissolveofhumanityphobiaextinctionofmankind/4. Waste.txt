[performed by Extinction of Mankind]Another fucking holocaust
Another waste of time
All devised by fat cats
To keep us all in line

A tragedy of greed and power
To show us where we stand
A disgusting desecration
By the scum who rule our lands

A future to live for
Or no future you died for
[Repeat all]
