[performed by Extinction of Mankind]As a new dawn breaks
The world awakes
I see each day
Through tear-filled eyes
Hopes and dreams
Are now destroyed
No future
Just an empty void

Where is the hope?
We always kept
Within our hearts
While others wept
Heal the wounds
And soothe the pain
And change despair
To hope again

Where is the hope?
We always kept
Within our hearts
While others wept
Heal the wounds
And soothe the pain
And change despair
To hope again
