[performed by Extinction of Mankind]We destroy ourselves every day
Destroying our world, destroying our way
We go through life feeling almost blind
Such longs travel often nothing to find

WHAT IS THE POINT OF STRIVING TO SURVIVE
ON THIS ROAD OF NO RETURN

Some become nobodies some become great
Some with such love some have anger and hate
How can we be so different yet also the same
We all have secrets of tragedy and shame

WHAT IS THE POINT OF STRIVING TO SURVIVE
ON THIS ROAD OF NO RETURN

Our reason for life seems so fuckinâ dense
We search for an answer so we can make sense
If weâre all here for a reason we want to know why
Something we may never know before we all die

WHAT IS THE POINT OF STRIVING TO SURVIVE
ON THIS ROAD OF NO RETURN

Our reason for life seems so fuckinâ dense
We search for an answer so we can make sense
If weâre all here for a reason we want to know why
Something we may never know before we all die

WHAT IS THE POINT OF STRIVING TO SURVIVE
ON THIS ROAD OF NO RETURN
