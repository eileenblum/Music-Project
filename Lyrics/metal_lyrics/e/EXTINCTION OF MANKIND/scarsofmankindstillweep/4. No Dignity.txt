Raped of any dignity, a beggers life you led
In a society that's devoid of the basic human need
An ever vicious circle, a fine that's fueled and fed
Trying to grab a slice of life 'cause you're a long time fucking dead

They pick us up then throw us down
Humiliate and intimidate, kick us to the ground

Hatred feeds on hatred a stigma's hard to shake
Classified a loser by the greedy on the make
A downtrodden existence to keep you in your place
A fucking state persistence they're never of your case
