Sounds of nature drowned by the machine
Destroying the countryside for a money making scheme
Animals run in terror from mankind's stinking hand
And the progress machine tears apart the land

World wide destruction, more species extinct
Mankind will you ever stop to think
Our forests die, the air now foul
But an end to the slaughter, they'll never allow

Allow non human life, not allowed to be free
Slaughtered and packaged for man to eat
Animals are sentient, not mankind's to kill
For food, for progress or just for the thrill

Pollution rises, disease on the rise
Once conquered, now back to plague mankind
Our downfall is coming, this we all know
Stop attacking the planet, we have nowhere else to go
