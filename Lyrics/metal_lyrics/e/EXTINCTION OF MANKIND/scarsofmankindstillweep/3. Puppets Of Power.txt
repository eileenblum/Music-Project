They built a shrine to power and yes it cost the Earth
They've had our lives planned from the moment of our birth
They gave us all our daily shit, force fed by church and school
They punished and humiliated if we broke their rules
They gave us a religion, a god to trust and obey
They fed us with their bullshit, every fucking day

They gave us opportunities, to make our place in society
They gave us a welfare state, a false sense of security
They gave us all a prison, to lock away those who fall
They gave us all a home for safety in four walls
They gave us television to comfort and sedate
They gave us all no reason to defy this fucking state

They gave us nuclear weapons to protect our fair green land
They fed us all lies from their ever grabbing hands
They outlawed all our protesters, they can't allow a riot
They gave us all an army to protect their state and wealth
They gave us a health service to protect our health

They take all they can from us then throw us on the heap
They retire you at sixty-five, when you're too old and weak
They take every shred of dignity you've ever achieved
They trick us all like card sharks, an ace up every sleeve
They are the system, we're puppets from birth to death
They'll build a shrine to nothing when they've destroyed the Earth
