DRAGGED INTO THE WORLD, SCREAMING AND KICKING
A CHOICE OF FALSE IDOLS, ARE YOURS FOR THE PICKING
TURN YOUR BACK ON THE ALTAR, FORGET HOLY GROUND
PISS IN HIS CHALICE, WIPE YOUR ARSE WITH HIS BLOOD

A COMMUNION FOUNTAIN
A CHRISTENING PIT
A BROW CROSSED WITH URINE
AND BAPTISED IN YOUR SHIT
SHIT, SHIT, BAPTISED IN YOUR SHIT

THE SHACKLES OF YOUR FAITH, WEIGH HEAVY ON YOUR MIND
BUT RELIGIONS JUST A COP-OUT, FOR THE STUPID AND THE BLIND
IT TAKES MORE THAN HOLY WATER, TO DROWN OUT ALL THE PAIN
TO STOP RELIGIOUS SLAUGHTER, WHEN THE INNOCENT ARE SLAIN

A COMMUNION FOUNTAIN
A CHRISTENING PIT
A BROW CROSSED WITH URINE
AND BAPTISED IN YOUR SHIT
SHIT, SHIT, BAPTISED IN YOUR SHIT
