THE AGONY OF REALITY
IS KNOWING LIFEâS BRUTALITY
THE IGNORANCE OF INNOCENCE
IS NOT KNOWING WHATâS TO COME

THE FURTHER FROM NORMALITY
THE MORE WE NEED A SANCTUARY
THE CLOSER TO INSANITY
THE MORE WE TRY TO HIDE

KEEPING ON THE RIGHT TRACKS
AVOIDING ALL THE STIGMAS
TRYING TO MAKE A GO OF IT THROUGH A LABYRINTH OF ENIGMAS
