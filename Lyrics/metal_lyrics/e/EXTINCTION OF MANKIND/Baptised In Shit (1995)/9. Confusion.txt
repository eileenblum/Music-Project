WITHOUT REMORSE WITHOUT COMPASSION, LIKE HAWKS STOOPING THEIR PREY
THEY COULDNâT SEE THROUGH THE HORRORS, AND NOW THE END IS NEAR

THE INNOCENTS WERE ON THEIR KNEES
AND THE CHURCHES WERE FULL
AS THE SIRENS RANG, THE NIGHTMARE HAS BEGUN

BETWEEN THE LAND AND SKY
AN INSTANT OF BLINDING LIGHT
BURNING FLAMES ALL AROUND
AS I INHALE THE POISON AIR

WITHOUT REMORSE WITHOUT COMPASSION, LIKE HAWKS STOOPING THEIR PREY
THEY COULDNâT SEE THROUGH THE HORRORS, AND NOW THE END IS NEAR

THE INNOCENTS WERE ON THEIR KNEES
AND THE CHURCHES WERE FULL
AS THE SIRENS RANG, THE NIGHTMARE HAS BEGUN
