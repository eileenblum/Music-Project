WELCOME HOME YOUâVE DONE YOUR DEED, NOW GET BACK INTO THE SWING OF THINGS
YOUR MIND IS WARPED YOUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD, A MILLION MEMORIES IN YOUR HEAD
YOUR BODIES FUCKED YOUR LIMBS ARE WEAK, THE NIGHTMARES COME BUT YOU CANâT SPEAK,
A GUTTURAL SCREAM IN THE DEAD NIGHT, ITâS THE GHOULS OF WAR THAT BLIND YOUR SIGHT
SWEATING CORPSES INVADE YOUR SPACE, NEGATIVE FLASHBACKS IN EVERY PLACE

ONCE A MAN IN LIFEâS REALITY, NOW A SHELL OF WARS BRUTALITY
ONCE A MAN WITH BIG IDEAS, NOW A SHELL WITH NOTHING BUT FEARS

YOU CANâT CONTROL WHAT YOU ARE FEELING YOUR THOUGHTS ARE NUMB YOUR SENSE REELING
A CASUAL GLANCE FROM A PASSERBY, A MURDEROUS ENEMY WITH DEATH IN HIS EYE
YOU MUST GET A GRIP FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SANITY
BUT YOUR PERSONAL HORRORS ARE PART OF HUMANITY
ITâS PARANOIA INSIDE YOUR HEAD AND IT WONâT GO AWAY,
EATING YOU FROM INSIDE OUT A BIT MORE EVERY DAY
SO NOW YOUâRE LIVING ALL ALONE IN YOUR PRIVATE HELL
BUT TO OTHERS YOUâRE THE HOME COMER WITH ANOTHER TALE TO TELL

ONCE A MAN IN LIFEâS REALITY, NOW A SHELL OF WARS BRUTALITY
ONCE A MAN WITH BIG IDEAS, NOW A SHELL WITH NOTHING BUT FEARS

[Repeat]
