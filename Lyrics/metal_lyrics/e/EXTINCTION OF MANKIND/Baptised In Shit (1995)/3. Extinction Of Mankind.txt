CAN WE REALLY LOOK AT ALL MANS ACHIEVEMENTS THROUGH THE AGES
CAN WE REALLY LOOK AT OUR PLANET AND SAY THIS IS A BETTER WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE?
THE NEED FOR MAN TO FORWARD AND BETTER HIMSELF OVER THE CENTURIES HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THE LAND, AIR AND SEA
THE FAT OF THE EARTH IS NO MORE, AT THE TIME OF DAWN THE COLOSSAL UNIVERSE
AND COULD SO EASILY BE WIPED OUT AND HAVE NO EFFECT ON MANKIND WHO HAS CLEARLY OVERSTEPPED THE MARK
SO NOW WE HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF SO CALLED PROGRESSION
WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SO CALLED MORE INTELLIGENT SPECIES
HAS REDUCED THEIR ONLY NATURAL HABITAT INTO A GLOBAL HELLHOLE
ON THE BRINK OF ANNIHILATION

LIVING IN A CESSPIT MADE BY HUMAN HANDS
THE ROTTING STENCH OF CORPSES , ACROSS OUR GREENLESS LAND
THEREâS NOWHERE LEFT TO PLAY, THEREâS NOWHERE THAT YOUâRE SAFE
POLLUTION DEATH AND MISERY, IS WITH US ALL TO STAY

EXTINCTION OF MANKIND, EXTINCTION OF MANKIND
YOUâRE NOT JUST KILLING YOURSELF, YOUâRE KILLING OFF HUMANKIND

WHERE ONCE THERE WAS FRESH RUNNING STREAMS
NOW ALL YOU HEAR ARE CHILDRENâS SCREAMS
THEY CONDITION BIOLOGICALLY, EVERYTHING THEY CAN
THEY WORSE MISTAKE EVER MADE, WAS WHEN EARTH CREATED MAN

EXTINCTION OF MANKIND, EXTINCTION OF MANKIND
YOUâRE NOT JUST KILLING YOURSELF, YOUâRE KILLING OFF HUMANKIND

THINK ABOUT IT
STOP THE SHIT
AND GIVE US ALL A BREAK
WEâVE ONLY GOT ONE PLANET
ITâS IN A FUCKING STATE
[â¦]

LIVING IN A CESSPIT MADE BY HUMAN HANDS
THE ROTTING STENCH OF CORPSES , ACROSS OUR GREENLESS LAND
THEREâS NOWHERE THAT YOUâRE SAFE THEREâS NOWHERE LEFT TO PLAY,
POLLUTION DEATH AND MISERY, IS WITH US ALL TO STAY

EXTINCTION OF MANKIND, EXTINCTION OF MANKIND
YOUâRE NOT JUST KILLING YOURSELF, YOUâRE KILLING OFF HUMANKIND
