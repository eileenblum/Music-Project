RUN TOWARDS THE SUN, BEFORE THE NIGHTS BEGUN
TAKE HOLD OF YOUR LOVED ONES, BEFORE THE COLD SETS IN
THE WIND CHILLS MY SPINE, AS I HOLD WHAT WAS ONCE MINE
NO FUTURE IN THIS WASTELAND, WE ONCE CALLED HOME
AS THE DOGS GNAW MY BONES, I PRAY FOR THE DAWN

PUSHING FORWARD, NEVER GOING BACK
SEEKING A WAY OUT, THOUGH A FADING GAP

SEE THE WRETCHED CORPSES, A CHILD WITHOUT A NAME
YOU CANâT SEE THROUGH THE CARNAGE, YOUâRE UNABLE TO FEEL THE PAIN
AS DAWN BEGINS TO BREAK, THEREâS NO SANCTUARY IN THE CHURCH
THE ONLY COMFORT IS IN DEATH

PUSHING FORWARD, NEVER GOING BACK
SEEKING A WAY OUT, THOUGH A FADING GAP

RUN TOWARDS THE SUN, BEFORE THE NIGHTS BEGUN
TAKE HOLD OF YOUR LOVED ONES, BEFORE THE COLD SETS IN
THE WIND CHILLS MY SPINE, AS I HOLD WHAT WAS ONCE MINE
NO FUTURE IN THIS WASTELAND, WE ONCE CALLED HOME
AS THE DOGS GNAW MY BONES, I PRAY FOR THE DAWN

PUSHING FORWARD, NEVER GOING BACK
SEEKING A WAY OUT, THOUGH A FADING GAP
