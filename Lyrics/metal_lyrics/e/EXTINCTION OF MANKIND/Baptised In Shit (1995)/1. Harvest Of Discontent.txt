PREJUDICE, BIGOTRY, POWER AND GREED
HAVE PROVEN THAT MAN IS BLIND
HIS WEAKNESSES WILL ULTIMATE IN EXTINCTION OF MANKIND

PROPHECIES OF MADNESS, HOW MUCH OF IT WAS KNOWN
PICKING UP THE PIECES, OF THE SEEDS THAT MAN HAS SOWN
REAPING IN THE HARVEST, OF A CORRUPT AND VILE LAND
COUNTING OUT THE LOSSES, âCOS YOU FAILED TO MAKE A STAND

WE PLOUGH THE FIELDS AND SCATTER THE BAD BLOOD OVER OUR LAND
ITâS FED AND WATERED BY YOUR GNARLED AND HUNGRY HAND

CONFINEMENT LIKE AN EMBRYO, IN A SEPTIC TATTERED WOMB
UNABLE TO OBTAIN A LIFE, DEALT BY THE HAND OF DOOM
AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS OVER, AN ENTITY SENT TO DEPRIVE
AN OBSTACLE OF PROGRESS, FOR THOSE WHO STRIVE TO SURVIVE

WE PLOUGH THE FIELDS AND SCATTER THE BAD BLOOD OVER OUR LAND
ITâS FED AND WATERED BY YOUR GNARLED AND HUNGRY HAND

PROPHECIES OF MADNESS, HOW MUCH OF IT WAS KNOWN
PICKING UP THE PIECES, OF THE SEEDS THAT MAN HAS SOWN
REAPING IN THE HARVEST, OF A CORRUPT AND VILE LAND
COUNTING OUT THE LOSSES, âCOS YOU FAILED TO MAKE A STAND
