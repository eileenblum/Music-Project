[performed by Extinction of Mankind]The color of your money
Is the same to anyone
But the color of your skin
Can bring you pain
A global reconstruction of a fascist back
Rejection and a holocaust of hatred and disdain

Intolerance of a shade less than pure
Malignancy breeds of this there's no cure

A whiter shade of ignorance
Grows by the generation
Constructed of the hate and scorn they hear
A darker shade of shamefulness
Is what they're made to feel
The cross that they must fear
Is what they fear
