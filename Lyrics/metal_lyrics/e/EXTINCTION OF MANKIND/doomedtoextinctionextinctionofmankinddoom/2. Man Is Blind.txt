[performed by Extinction of Mankind]Man is blind he has no eyes
His conventional lifestyle filled with lies
Off to the office the boss's arse he licks
Look at him sweating the deals fallen through
No more pay checks and company cars for you
He tries to grovel he tries to plead
But the boss wants more get down on your knees

Your blinded by your ignorance
You can't see what you've done
You just sit back and lap it up
You money making scum
