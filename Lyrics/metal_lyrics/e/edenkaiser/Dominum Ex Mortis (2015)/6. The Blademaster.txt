Seeking death I waste my breath
By a wasteland I roam
Living without fate, seing without eyes
My flesh is here, ethereal being is gone.

Flattered to this hopeless and anguish ground
Eliminate the purity that befouls the world

Agony is my pleasure
My sick mind is chasing you
I feed of suffering
Blademaster is chasing you

Nor dead you will rest
In your worst nightmares
You will die over and over again
Do you remember me?
Ten lifetimes ago I begged for my life
But your mercy was denied
Denied!

Agony is my pleasure
My sick mind is chasing you 
I feed of suffering
Blademaster is chasing you
