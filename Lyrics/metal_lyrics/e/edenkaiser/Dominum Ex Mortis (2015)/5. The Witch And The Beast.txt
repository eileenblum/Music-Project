Long winter, cold and raw
Woman looks the pale moon
Bloody tears falls in the snow
Her soul is possessed by the beast
Who she had loved.

Wicked daughter, tempting flesh
Witch and beast, eternal disgrace.
Ancient hunger, unchained anger 
Satan bastard, nightfall master

Lovers howl was her damnation
Black magic, inheritance of ancestors.
Fault of destiny, cruelty of beast
Blessed sins, unholy witch
Long winter, cold and raw
Bitch looks the pale moon
Essence of delight stains the snow
Her body is possessed by the beast
She had invoked.
