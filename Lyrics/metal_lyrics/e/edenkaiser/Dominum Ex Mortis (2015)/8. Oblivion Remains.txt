Oxide and blood permeate the ruins 
Of what one day were walls
Damn smell that keep me awake
My immortal condition is my squall 
Of guiltiness
Blast from the past bursts into my brain
Ripping my condemned soul
Oh, it hurts, so grievous
My fury was my hole

Oblivion remains
Remains inside me
Assassin's deceit
Deceit is the only way
Bloodlust persist
Sharpening the knife
Oblivion remains
The only thing that exist

Ruthless void, 
What do you want from me?
 I gave you my indicted spirit, 
Wicked for aeons I'll be
Pain I spread
Is eating me now
Voices forced me
Devil told me.
Oh so grievous
It hurts
Bleakness... 
Oh hatred
