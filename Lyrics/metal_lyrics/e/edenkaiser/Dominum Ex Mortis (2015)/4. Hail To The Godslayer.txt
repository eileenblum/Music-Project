I breath that disease called faith, 
Devourer instinct grows up inside me. 
Disease mesmerizes my senses.
Empires born of lies, a way that should not be. 

Wasted time searching the truth, 
Your life will be nothing but grief
Morbid illusions, lying and false 
Depravity hidden behind beliefs.
Army of rejects athirst of angel's blood
Chaos, my name; Godslayer doesn't know sorrow
Conquering the thrones, feeding on storms
Opening the gates, badge of the slain 
Hail to the Godslayer! 

(Amalthea, Lykurgos, Hamedicu, Dievs, Enki, Somnus, Ku'Urkil, Istanu, Mithras!)

Time has come, countdown is over
Night has fallen, moon arises 
And devils growl under the mystical mater

Just one God has survived to my wrath
He who kneels in front of me
Pleading for his sordid existence
Proudly I'll wear his stinky skin
Divine denial, extreme ecstasy
Your God died, we will live!
