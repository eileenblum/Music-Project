Eradicate is our duty
Apocalypse has come
Fucking christians, you'll suffer 
The wrath of the horde
Eternal torment by pagan's hands
You'll taste the martyrium 
Of your beloved Lord
Your pleas are shackles to freedom
Flames what you deserve

Eternal Martyrium
Insane devotion, nails in entrails
Ropes immobilize your movements, 
Rough and unbreakable. 
Blood in nails adhered
At my mercy you are, rest...
Rest!
