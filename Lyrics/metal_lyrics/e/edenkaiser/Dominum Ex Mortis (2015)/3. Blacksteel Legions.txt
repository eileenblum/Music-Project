War, born to dominate
Revenge to those who indoctrinate
Sword in hand, powered by defiance
Cause and effect is my reliance

Death to the false heretic
Fallen brothers were left behind
Sorrounded by despair 
Mad will win the blind
Pain makes man be a man
Wounds heal, tanning our body 
They act as a shield 
Branding our destiny until our expected end

Wind roarsÂ furiously
It's fanning the flames
War, torchs in high
Our lands is our claim
War, torchs in high
Our lands is our claim
We are Blacksteel legions
We are Blacksteel legions
