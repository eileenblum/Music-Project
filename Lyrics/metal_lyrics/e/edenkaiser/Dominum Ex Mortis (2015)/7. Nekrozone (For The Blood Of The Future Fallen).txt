Shattered inocence, disturbed sanity
Impaled nature, skinned fidelity.
Beyond repair damage, far from change
No time for regrets, words based on dread
One thousand million volts tears 
Necrozone will take its debt.

(Water, air, fire, earth 
Water, air, fire, death)
Mother is betrayed by the son
Your pain is now burning in your guts
Your heart is torn apart
Mother, destroy our lives.

For the blood of the future fallen we'll mourn
For the blood of our progeny we'll bemoan 
Mother Earth listen our words
The stars keep the secret of our faults
