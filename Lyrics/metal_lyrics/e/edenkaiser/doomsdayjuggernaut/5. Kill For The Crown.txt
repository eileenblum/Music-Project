Far beyond the realms of chaos, I carry out my charge
A wicked legion against the tide, oh, soon you'll be dead.
A nightmare fate awaits your soul, in a doomed oblivion you'll stay.
Eye for an eye, death for death. 
Gazing at your reflection in the mirror, 
Damned hands stained with blood,
Sadistic thoughts drown you in the fluid
Of your madness.
Vengance is taken, wait for the fire
Your sins have not been forgotten
Justice awakened at last.

Crossing the line between good and evil,
Perversity flows through my veins
Luring me, calling me
Fate will be the pain
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill for the fucking crown, bastards!
