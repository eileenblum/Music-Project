I rise from the dephts of hell 
Bringing chaos and wrath
Black venom running through my veins
It's time to act
Devoid of flesh bound to my soul
Walking between opposite poles
The ancient warrior awaken
Come and see the death toll. 
Eternal bloody moon,
Human race must disappear
Plague of rats, go away from here!
Enter Mephisto!

Enter Mephisto, Godfather of chaos
Enter Mephisto, enter the Pain
Enter Mephisto, Godfather of chaos
Enter Mephisto, enter and reign
I'm the new god of the mankind
Your soul will be mine.
