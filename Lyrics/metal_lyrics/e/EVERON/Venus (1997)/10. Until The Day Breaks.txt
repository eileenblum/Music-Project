I know a story
That I'd really like to tell you
You might not believe me
But I swear every word is true

It sounds like one of those
That you normally read
In strange and cheap magazines
But this one is different
You can take it from me
Because the person it tells of is me

Moonlight
You're my only reason to live (tonight)
Stir my passion, stir my instincts
Cast my shadow on the wall

Moonlight
You're the only bride that I need (by my side)
Feed my senses, feed my hunger
Feed my spirit, feed my soul

When I was a young boy
I felt I did not have the same
Ideas as the others
So at first I was hiding in shame

Something was calling me outside
In cold and moonlit nights
So I had to accept I possessed
Some really strange passions
But the strangest obsession
Was a certain preference for blood

Moonlight
You're my only reason to live (tonight)
Stir my passion, stir my instincts
Cast my shadow on the wall

Moonlight
You're the only bride that I need (by my side)
Feed my senses, feed my hunger
Feed my spirit, feed my soul

You all know who I am
You meet me every now and then
Before the day breaks

My guise is not what it seems
I'll haunt you in your dreams
Until the day breaks

You deny me in daylight
But you're afraid every night
Until the day breaks

I'll haunt you like your shadow

I'm your illegal child
That you're trying to hide
I'm your secret lover
You're trying to keep undercover
The black page in your past
That she'll find out at last
I'm every sleepless night
I'm your hopeless fight
I'm the promise you did break
I'm the truth that you can't fake
I'm your conscience, your fear
So I will always be here

I'll haunt you like your shadow

Moonlight
You're my only reason to live (tonight)
Stir my passion, stir my instincts
Cast my shadow on the wall

Moonlight
You're the only bride that I need (by my side)
Feed my senses, feed my hunger
Feed my spirit, feed my soul
