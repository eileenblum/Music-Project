There's a willing crowd
In a distant land
Clinging to the words of their leader

There's a censored press
Printing propaganda
Disguised as the truth for the reader

For food or religion
For land or for pride
For traditions or just for the glory

The page is turned
For another chapter
Of the same old story

Again we see how they are marching on
To the beat of the same old drum
Don't they know this mad story has
No happy ending

So far, so good
Here we are
The clean slate is showing a red stain

So far, so good
Here we are
And hope that we're not missing the last train

But as life makes no deal
We can't turn back the wheel
And the last train leaves right on time

All of them have their own reasons
All of them have their own fears
All of them pray to some God
To make it turn out right

All of them leave their own families
And think it's worth the price
Because everyone thinks it's him
Who's fighting the good fight

So here they are in the same old church
There's a priest who's blessing arms one more time
They say their prayers to a wooden cross
But who will listen

So far, so good
Here we are
The clean slate is showing a red stain

So far, so good
Here we are
And hope that we're not missing the last train

But as life makes no deal
We can't turn back the wheel
And the last train leaves right on time

Again we see how they are marching on
To the beat of the same old drum
Don't they know this mad story has
No happy ending

So far, so good
Here we are
The clean slate is showing a red stain

So far, so good
Here we are
And hope that we're not missing the last train

But as life makes no deal
We can't turn back the wheel
And the last train leaves right on time
