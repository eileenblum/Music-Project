Just another Monday morning
I'm pushing my way through the traffic jam
Nothing really seems to move
I'm trying to get ahead the best I can

I start thinking about my life
And about what let me get this far
Is a tiny little wheel inside a big machine
Really all we are

Not today
This day is mine
Everything's just perfect
I can feel the whole world's gently swinging my way

After all
That I've been through
All that lies behind me
It feels like there's a whole new life and it's just begun

I get right out of my car
I feel that I've got better things to do
Can't see yet what that might be
But it's a fact a change was overdue

I know it is not always wise
To simply run away
But I don't mind the consequences
At least not today

This day is mine
Everything's just perfect
I can feel the whole world's gently swinging my way

After all
That I've been through
All that lies behind me
It feels like there's a whole new life and it's just begun

Ask yourself if you really are
The one you want to be
Look around and say if you see
What you wish there would be

Every now and then our balance slips away
Every now and then what we get isn't worth the price we pay

I'm tired of trying to meet
Someone else's expectations
For the price of missing my own
That just gave me frustration

That chase for money
Was a plan that surely had to fail
So my decision's clear, from this day on I am
Not for sale

This day is mine
Everything's just perfect
I can feel the whole world's gently swinging my way

After all
That I've been through
All that lies behind me
It feels like there's a whole new life and it's just begun
