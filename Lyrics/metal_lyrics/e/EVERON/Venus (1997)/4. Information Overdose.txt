There you sit with glassy eyes
Staring at that oversize
Computer-screen in front of you
The whole day and night long

Entangled in that world wide web
Did the head below your baseball-cap
Ever wonder if in your life something
Might be going wrong

You've got an information overdose
That's a fact that you can't conceal
Your world is made of bits and bytes
But there's a world outside that is for real

Your girlfriend lives in New York
You've got to know her in cyberspace
You say that you're in love but will you
Ever meet her face to face

To have a thousand friends
Around the whole wide world is what you claim
But how come in your neighbourhood
No one at all knows your name

You've got an information overdose
That's a fact that you can't conceal
Your world is made of bits and bytes
But there's a world outside that is for real

This world's become a crazy place
The magic left without a trace
Sober-minded concepts took the place
That dreams once had

We've got pills for every little thing
Only health they never seem to bring
It's a crazy place indeed

Everyone is smiling bright
Everybody feels alright
For every problem there's another drug
To drown the pain

Technology saves time they say
So who took all the time away
It's a crazy place indeed

There you sit with glassy eyes
Staring at that oversize
Computer-screen in front of you
The whole day and night long

Entangled in that world wide web
Did the head below your baseball-cap
Ever wonder if in your life something
Might be going wrong

You've got an information overdose
That's a fact that you can't conceal
Your world is made of bits and bytes
But there's a world outside that is for real
