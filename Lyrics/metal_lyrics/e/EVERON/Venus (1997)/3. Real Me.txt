I should have known in the beginning
It had to reach a bitter end
To play the knight in shining armour
When I was just a simple man

But I became the one you wanted
And for a while it all made perfect sense
So I believed telling you lies was
Just an act of self defense

So it goes
Don't we all know the story
Of princes and frogs
And dreams colliding with real life

Well, it shouldn't have come as a surprise
You could have been well prepared for this
You could have seen it in my eyes
If you had looked there once

I never liked telling you lies
I've always hoped at last you'd see
The man behind the disguise
The real me
