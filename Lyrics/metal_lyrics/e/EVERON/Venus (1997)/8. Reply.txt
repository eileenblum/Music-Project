I found it right here on the table
That letter you left for me today
Just a handful of scribbled words
And most of it sounds quite absurd

Do you know the feeling
I know the feeling well
To go into the great unknown
Knowing all the doors behind are shut

You did not leave an address so I guess
You had no interest
In my possible reply
Though I've never been a man of words
Right now there is a thing or two
I would really like to say

Do you know the feeling
I know the feeling well
To be hurt but try to hide it
To know the truth but still deny it
To put on a brave face

I could have stood the pain
The tears and the blame
I could have stood those eyes fixed upon me
But what I just can't accept
Is the simple fact
You just quietly went out of here

I know we went from day to day
Trying not to state what was clear
For both of us to see
If it had to come to an end
Then why not do it with
A shred of honesty

Do you know the feeling
I know the feeling well
To always search but never find
To run but still be left behind
To finish second best

I could have stood the pain
The tears and the blame
I could have stood those eyes fixed upon me
But what I just can't accept
Is the simple fact
You just quietly went out of here

How could it ever hurt so bad
Where it used to feel so good

I won't ask you to come back
I won't ask you to stay
But I want you to listen to
What I've got to say

I don't want your apology
I don't need your sympathy
All I want from you is
Just a minute of your time

May I please remind you it was you who said
I was too reserved
Right from the start
And now you slam that door on me
When I was just about to come right in
And open up my heart

Do you know the feeling
I know the feeling well
When the best you give is not enough
To not let good times get rough
To not let it all start again

I could have stood the pain
The tears and the blame
I could have stood those eyes fixed upon me
But what I just can't accept
Is the simple fact
You just quietly went out of here
