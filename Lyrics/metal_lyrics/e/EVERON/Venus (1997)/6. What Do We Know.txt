Since the first days
Of mankind's existence
We have spent most of the time
Searching for answers
To all of the questions
Going around in our minds

What do we know
About the plans life makes for us
What do we know
About what we really are
What do we know

Now and then
There were people pretending
They had all the answers in store
Prophets, magicians
Experts and politicians
What were they ever good for

How could they know
What tomorrow holds for us
What do they know
That we don't know ourselves

Bring on all those experts
Let them show what they have got
Until we come to the conclusion
It is better they shut up

Hot air is all they can offer
Their empty hands have nothing to show
Hot air packed in technical terms
To explain what they don't know

Expert predictions
We all used to trust
Have led us into more than one mess
To me there's just one
Logical explanation
In fact they're just making a guess

How could they know
What tomorrow holds for us
What do they know
That we don't know ourselves

Bring on all those experts
Let them show what they have got
Until we come to the conclusion
It is better they shut up

Hot air is all they can offer
Their empty hands have nothing to show
Hot air packed in technical terms
To explain what they don't know

Can you imagine
Living in a world without mysteries
How would that feel
All I can say is
I honestly hope
Some secrets remain unrevealed

What do we know
About the plans life makes for us
What do we know
About what we really are
What do we know
