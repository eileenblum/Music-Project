Restless heart
Inside of me
Will you ever let me find the place
Where I was meant to be

Heart of stone
Heart of gold
One day full of love and warmth
But the next day full of cold

Sure, I remember
Those good days we had
It's true, we've been making plans
How could I forget

Sometimes "forever"
Means just "longer than a day"
Some say they'll never leave you
But then they simply turn and walk away

I don't know
The reason why
Against all my best intentions
My intentions always die

Though I try to stay
I will soon be gone
Somehow it seems that I am just not one
To rely on

Sure, I remember
Those good days we had
It's true, we've been making plans
How could I forget

Sometimes "forever"
Means just "longer than a day"
Some say they'll never leave you
But then they simply turn and walk away

Sure, I remember
Those good days we had
It's true, we've been making plans
How could I forget

Sometimes "forever"
Means just "longer than a day"
Some say they'll never leave you
But then they simply turn and walk away
