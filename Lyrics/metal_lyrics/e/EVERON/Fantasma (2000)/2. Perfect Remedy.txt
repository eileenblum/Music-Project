People like us are never where they want to be
People like us suffer from their incapacity
People like us never trust the world they see
People like us are lacking self-security

People like us want to know the outcome in advance
People like us are afraid they might miss out on their one great chance
People like us are known for their sensitivity
People like us sometimes drown in melancholy

Am I good for you
Are you good for me
Are we each other's poison or each other's only therapy

If you believe in me
I will believe in you
I'll believe in all your crazy dreams
And keep fingers crossed one day they'll all come true

People like us always have their concerns and fears
People like us always have one eye filled with tears
People like us think a lot more than they speak
To people like us they all come when it's help they seek

People like us you all turn to when you feel bad
But those people like us are the first ones you forget
Because people like us don't fit into your world at all
But it's people like us that always catch you when you fall

Am I good for you
Are you good for me
Are we each other's poison or each other's only therapy

If you believe in me
I will believe in you 
I'll believe in all your crazy dreams
And keep my fingers crossed one day they'll all come true

People like us always reach out for the stars
People like us have a heart covered with scars
People like us may not be easy, that is true
But only people like us can understand each other the way we do...

Am I good for you
Are you good for me
Are we each other's poison or each other's only therapy

I'll be good for you
Like you'll be good for me
You are my perfect remedy

If you believe in me
Like I believe in you...
