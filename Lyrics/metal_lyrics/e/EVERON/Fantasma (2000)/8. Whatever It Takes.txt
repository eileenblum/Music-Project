So whatever it takes
With every dream that first broke
And then moved out of sight
Another door to my heart
Has been closed and locked tight

So nothing gets in there
And there can be no doubt
There is so much inside
That can't find a way out

So whatever it takes
I will do it to unlock these doors

Don't you think this is
What life is about after all
We must stand up no matter
How often we fall

Because once we give in
All the doors remain closed
And under lock and key they will keep
The things we need most

So whatever it takes
We should do it to unlock these doors
