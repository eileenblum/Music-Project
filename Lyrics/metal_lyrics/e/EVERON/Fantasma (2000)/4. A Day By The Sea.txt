I went down to the sea
Alone on that stormy day
Hoped the wind and the rain
Might wash my pain away

So I took that ring
And I threw it out on the sea
The ring just sank down
But the pain still was there with me

Picking up the pieces of my life
When I look back it still cuts like a knife
To see us both give up so easily
And much too soon

Did you really think it was too late
The only thing you should have done was to have some faith
In me when I needed it the most
But you never did

We have only two hands
So we can't hold too much at once
And for some things in life
We just get one single chance

As long as it's good
We wish it may never stop
But to pick up something new
There's always one thing we have to drop

Those mistakes we made
May help us to make amends
But it is so hard to see things like that
While you stand there with empty hands

But I know one day love
Is going to come back on silent wings
Now that we know what we have lost
Let's see what tomorrow brings
