We hide when it's close
But reach out from the distance
For the love we need
For the warmth we seek

We all share the same hope
That one day we'll find the right one
Who is worth our trust
Whose heart beats just for us, but...

What if that was here all the time only we never noticed
What if that was here but we've been to blind to see it
What if that was here only we did never reach out for it
What if we already had the best there was to come

Plans that we made
All vanished into nowhere
We carried too much load
Down a winding road

Fragile we are 
Sometimes we all need someone
Need a heart that feels
Need a hand that heals us

What if that was here all the time only we never noticed
What if that was here but we've been to blind to see it
What if that was here only we did never reach out for it
What if we already had the best there was to come

I hope it wasn't here
Let's hope it was not here

What if that was here all the time only we never noticed
What if that was here but we've been to blind to see it
Let's hope it was not here only we did never reach out for it
Hope ahead of us is still the best there is to come...

So may you find luck
May you become as happy as can be
May the sun shine on whichever way you'll choose to take

May you feel allright
May you have all that you have been dreaming of
And may your smile come from your heart and be no fake

May you find love
May someone give you all I just could not give
And may he still love you when you are old and gray

So take good care of yourself
And I hope you know I really mean it when I say
Of all those years we shared I don't regret a day
