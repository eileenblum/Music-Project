There was a time when we were
As close as hearts can be
Your pain and fear, your dreams and hopes
All that you shared with me

I was just a child back then
As I grew up I had to see
Not all those wishes that we have
Become reality

In all those years of doing nothing
But killing time
Having lost my faith, my strength, my power
Was my hardest crime...

I know that you tried hard to save me
When I was about to drown
But your way of trying to help me up
In fact just dragged me down

You've put me in a golden cage
All luxuries we shared
You hoped I would feel safe and warm
But in fact I just felt scared

After all those years of doing nothing
But killing time
In the end I felt like a prisoner
Of my image you designed...

In a moment of rage I broke out of that cage
Spread my wings and found I could fly

In a moment of pain I broke free from the chain
Much too long I had lived a lie

In the end I just had too much
Of the getting in and out of touch
Of all that moving forth and moving back again

Men of steel turn into men of rust
Before they either bite the dust
Or simply run away if they still can...
