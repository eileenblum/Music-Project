Love is a pretender, an actor, a clown
It lifts us higher, but it lets us down
Love is the traveller, that never arrives
But is love the saviour, that saves our lifes

All that I wanted...
... its all I wanted to know
... its all I wish you'd have shown me
... and still all I want to believe in
Right now til the end of time

Love pays us visits, but it never stays long
It may be righteous, but mostly it's wrong
Love is indifferent, it makes no deal
Love lasts forever, but is forever for real

All that I wanted...
... its all I wanted to know
... its all I wish you'd have shown me
... and still all I want to believe in
Right now til the end of time

Show me, tell me, save me,
Save this heart of mine
And I show you, tell you, hold you
Til the end of time

I know it is not fair
That I bring all that here
I hope you won't regret too soon
That I'm the one you chose

I know it ain't fair
And that I may ask too much
But it has been so long ago
That someone has come so close...

Love is posessive, love takes control
Love is a stealer, 
So love, steal my soul
