Thoughts are moving slow
In constant fatal flow
In this labyrinth I'm in
On a sheet of ice too thin

No words for what I feel
I cannot describe
Why can no one understand this

I climbed the ladder stair by stair
I hoped that I would get somewhere
I found that movement is my way
To stop the world from turning grey

But now I reached a wall
It stands there high and tall
Once built for my protection
Now it stands right in my way

Courage is the spark, hope is the drive
Our passion, our hunger
Our aims let us strive
But my rose-coloured windows
Broke long ago
And the clear look that's left
Makes my tears sometimes flow
For some wounds we have
Only time knows the cure

There is nothing worse that we can do
Nothing worse for me and you
Than boxing shadows with our memories
Boxing shadows with our past
Never look back

Those walls we have inside
Those walls we built on pride
Every day they are growing higher
And cut the sunlight from our eyes
This is just another lesson
We must learn

Courage is the spark, hope is the drive
Our passion, our hunger
Our aims let us strive
But my rose-coloured windows
Broke long ago
And the clear look that's left
Makes my tears sometimes flow
For some wounds we have
Only time knows the cure

A step you dare
On unknown land
The common touch
Of a helping hand
A light that shines
Right through the mist
Or the desperate power
Of a clenching fist

Go on, when the whole world around you
Is falling to pieces
There is still something left
To hold on to
