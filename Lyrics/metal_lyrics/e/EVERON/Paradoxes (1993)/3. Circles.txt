Trying to get it all out of my mind
Searching for sentences, trying to put down some lines
That say how it feels
That say all those things we left unsaid

Fragments of pictures, like flickering lights
Come into my mind and then they get out of my sight
But each one leaves a dark dark trace behind

It was one of the days
When it feels like we could lose anything that's worth keeping
And it makes me confused
But maybe tomorrow brings more than what we hoped to find

Hold on, when the bridges in between are broken
Let us hold on to that day that lies ahead
Let us hold on, and say the words we have never spoken
Hold on, anything we do is better than
Moving in circles of sadness

Missed opportunities and chances passed
Cautious hopes that dissolved at last
Have brought me here
Made me cry those bitter tears

In circles I go round and round
One day lost and one day found
I hoped in vain that it could ease my pain
To think it over, again and again

It was one of the days
When it feels like we could lose anything that's worth keeping
And it makes me confused
But maybe tomorrow brings more than what we hoped to find

Hold on, when the bridges in between are broken
Let us hold on to that day that lies ahead
Let us hold on, and say the words we have never spoken
Hold on, anything we do is better than
Moving in circles of sadness

I know wherever the wind may blow
Might be the place
Where I should go
The tears will be gone before tomorrow is there
I can feel my heart beat faster
As I finally raise my head and swear
I will hold on
I will hold on
Let us hold on
Let us hold on

Hold on, when the bridges in between are broken
Let us hold on to that day that lies ahead
Let us hold on, and say the words we have never spoken
Hold on, anything we do is better than
Moving in circles of sadness
