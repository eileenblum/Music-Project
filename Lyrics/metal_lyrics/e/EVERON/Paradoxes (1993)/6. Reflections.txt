Tell me how do you think about what I do
About the story you have heard
Tell me why does that man in the mirror not look like me
It all seems so absurd
I only tried to find out
What is wrong with me
Now I stare into these eyes
Of that man in the mirror that once was me
And I cannot believe
That it is real what I see

A broken heart lies on the floor and no one cares about
A man caught behind prison walls is trying to break out
But what I have to know is, if this is all I could expect
Because after all these years I thought you'd owe me some respect

At the end of each day, there is a hole in my heart
That reminds me of you
At the end of each day, there is a hole in my heart
Tell me what to do
Won't someone tell me what I can do

Ain't no explanation
I don't want to put the blame on you
I am not here to try
To turn false into true
I don't want to argue
I don't want to apologise
I am here to testify
And that is what I say

At the end of each day, there is a hole in my heart
That reminds me of you
At the end of each day, there is a hole in my heart
Tell me what to do
Won't someone tell me what I can do

When my castle collapses to sand
When the treasures I hold
Slip right through my hands
Do you know how that feels

I know I should stop to struggle with myself
To ponder and pore over things I cannot change
Whatever you say, whatever you will do
Somehow I am still yours
Although you are acting strange

No miracle cure, no magic boxes
To save me from drowning to rescue me
But I can't deny that while I stand here
The boat that I am on is sinking into the sea

A broken heart lies on the floor and no one cares about
A man caught behind prison walls is trying to break out
But what I have to know is, if this is all I could expect
Because after all these years I thought you'd owe me some respect

At the end of each day, there is a hole in my heart
That reminds me of you
At the end of each day, there is a hole in my heart
Tell me what to do
Won't someone tell me what I can do

And so I lay my defences down
When I listen to my heart
I hear the sound of a cold machine
That fills an empty space
Like a clockwork ticking
This is all that I can feel
