Words used as weapons
Hurting like a knife
Violence, intolerance
Between man and wife
A little child that shivers
Afraid of its own daddy's touch

Those people look like you and me
Absolutely ordinary
Sometimes you even find them
On Sunday mornings in the church

But you can see it in their eyes
They are private warriors in disguise
It is a struggle for existence
For the right to disagree

This is private war behind closed doors
Where it leads nobody knows
They are conquerors in the name of ignorance
This is private war behind closed doors
Just a family affair, but a red river's source
This is private war

Two heads of state discussing
Find no way to compromise
They hold their different points of view
And the tension starts to rise

They are just like you and me
But they got something deep within
There is a time bomb ticking
Under those people's skin

A man and his wife
Mother and daughter
Brother and brother
Father and son
If they had an army to command
So what would they have done

You can see it in their eyes
They are private warriors in disguise
It is a struggle for existence
For the right to disagree

This is private war behind closed doors
Where it leads nobody knows
They are conquerors in the name of ignorance
This is private war behind closed doors
Just a family affair, but a red river's source
This is private war

You can see it in their eyes
They are private warriors in disguise
It is a struggle for existence
For the right to disagree

This is private war behind closed doors
Where it leads nobody knows
They are conquerors in the name of ignorance
This is private war behind closed doors
Just a family affair, but a red river's source
This is private war
This is war
