Long ago it went out of our hands
We are believing in words that we don't understand
Trust in the media's honest appeal
And forgot to trust in what we feel

Set all your channels open to receive
It will not be in vain
Collecting and reflecting
Is the way that leads away from pain

Life behind the barriers, in invisible frontiers
In a jail of glass, with walls made of frozen tears
Through windows we see, in the papers, on TV
Those information cannot mean much
Through windows we see, but we cannot touch

It is not the tumble of the dice
Remove those hands from your eyes
Just open windows in your mind
Leave the barriers behind

It is just a different state of mind
A thinking of a different kind
A little bit more encouraged voice
Speaking for the right of choice

Farewell to all that lies behind
Farewell to this pair of tired eyes
The head in the sky, the feet on the ground
We break all the walls around

Life behind the barriers, in invisible frontiers
In a jail of glass, with walls made of frozen tears
Through windows we see, in the papers, on TV
Those information cannot mean much
Through windows we see, but we cannot touch

It is not the tumble of the dice
Remove those hands from your eyes
Just open windows in your mind
Leave the barriers behind

Open eyes and open ears
Won't let us get too far
If we can't lay down our masquerades
And stand for what we are
All these sheets of glass are the barries between
Those of us, who wish to be
Those, who don't wish to seem
It's time to open windows in our minds

It is not the tumble of the dice
Remove those hands from your eyes
Just open windows in your mind
Leave the barriers behind
