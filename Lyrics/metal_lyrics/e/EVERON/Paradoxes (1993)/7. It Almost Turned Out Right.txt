It feels like time is running backwards
Somehow it don't want to pass by
But I get so nervous and afraid of what is to come
And I just cannot tell you why

I can hear all the words you say
But I don't understand
Should I have looked at your smiling face
When I looked at your shivering hands

It is a game of hope and glory
It is a game of shame and pride
It is a never ending story
And it never turns out right

So don't ask me, if you need good advice
Maybe I could find some friendly words
But my heart is cold as ice
I can hear all the words you say
But I don't understand
Should I have looked at your smiling face
When I looked at your shivering hands

It is a game of hope and glory
It is a game of shame and pride
It is a never ending story
And it never turns out right

It is a game of hope and glory
It is a game of shame and pride
It is a never ending story
And it never turns out right

It could have almost turned out right
It almost turned out right
It could have almost turned out right
