Why don't you realise
There are things that are so clear
And pretend that everything is alright
While you try to make believe
That there ain't nothing wrong
You can't count your sleepless nights

What can you say at the point of no return
No use to ask for right or wrong
What will you say when the fire stops to burn
And there's no place left where you belong

We won't be happy
With all the things we have
If we can't stop thinking of the cost
We won't be happy
With all our friends we have
Filled up with fear
That they might once get lost

What can you say at the point of no return
No use to ask for right or wrong
What will you say when the fire stops to burn
And there's no place left where you belong

Go face the world
Take things just the way they are
Face the world
Let honesty be our guiding star
We face the world
There ain't no use to lie to yourself
Face the world always eye to eye
When the world is facing you

You can say it gets better
When it won't
You can say age makes you wiser
But it don't
You can plead, you can preach
You can knock on wood until your fingers bleed
But you will not change a fact ...

Go face the world
Take things just the way they are
Face the world
Let honesty be our guiding star
We face the world
There ain't no use to lie to yourself
Face the world always eye to eye
When the world is facing you

What can you say at the point of no return
No use to ask for right or wrong
What will you say when the fire stops to burn
And there's no place left where you belong

Go face the world
Take things just the way they are
Face the world
Let honesty be our guiding star
We face the world
There ain't no use to lie to yourself
Face the world always eye to eye
When the world is facing you
