The evening sun shines on the sea
Forgotten dreams come back to me
A river run dry returns in flood
Running through my veins
Running through my blood

It was a very special magic moment's glance
A dreamer back in paradise
A dancer lost in trance
Every word you said still echoes in my ears

When I close my eyes I still hear every noise
I would not waste a minute, if I had the choice
If I could make the winds raise with a prayer
I would call them all to take me there

Rivers run dry, but waters flow
No sun in the sky, but flowers grow
A silent scream that hurts my ears
A friendly word that causes fears

That's what we are
We live in the age of the paradox man
In riddles we speak and riddles we are
I cannot take anymore

From the day of our birth we are searching for tenderness
For the love we need and acceptance we seek without cautiousness
With every day that goes by our demands grow
While our conscience seems to get less
I am just like this myself
And so that is what I confess

It is a wired game we play
Everyone so led astray
How I wish there was somebody
That I could count upon

How many times in my life have I sold my own identity
Have I been the victim of my own incapacity

It's an endless flow
A constant up and down
Sometimes we are close to reach a shore
Sometimes we are close to drowning
Forever it goes on
From our first day to the last
There are some precious moments in between
They are all I need
They are all I care for

Rivers run dry, but waters flow
No sun in the sky, but flowers grow
"Yes" we say, but "No" we mean
Mostly things are not what they seem

That's how it is
We live in an age of paradoxes
Encoded in riddles
But nobody knows what they mean anymore

Wasting years with a second's levity
Undermining laws of gravity
Generations sacrificed on the altar of progress
If there would only be a place somewhere
That could offer me some rest
Where I could stay until this storm is over
So here is my request

It's an endless flow
A constant up and down
Sometimes we are close to reach a shore
Sometimes we are close to drowning
Forever it goes on
From our first day to the last
There are some precious moments in between
They are all I need
They are all I care for

Higher than high becomes lower than low
We go faster than fast, but move slower than slow
Perspectives change in the moment of truth
The travesty ends in the moment of proof

It was a very special magic moment's glance
A dreamer back in paradise
A dancer lost in trance
Every word you said still echoes in my ears
The shining sparkle in your eyes
This is all I need
This is all I care for
