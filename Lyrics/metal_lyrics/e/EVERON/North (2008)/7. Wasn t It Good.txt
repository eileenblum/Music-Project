Focused on the things we're missing
Ignoring everything we've got
A thousand doors that stand wide open
Won't make up for just one that's shut
Seeking nearness from the distance
But scared whenever it comes close
Frozen hearts exposed too briefly
To the sun to melt the floes

All my secrets, dreams and wishes
Freely laid into your hands
My faith and my self-esteem
Rise and fall at your command
All my nerves and all my senses
In constant state of red alert
A mind in pointless, restless motion
A body hopelessly inert

Hiding behind walls of silence
When there would have been so much to say
Whoever said 'Silence is golden'
For sure he'd never come our way

Nostalgia is a dangerous poison
If mixed with bitterness and grief
Makes the past look so much brighter
Forms illusions of relief
Makes what's lost still seem an option
Though it failed the test of time
Pretends the years have done no damage
That we're still in our prime

Wasn't it good, good just the way it was
Wasn't it good, before we first tasted loss
When it felt real, and not too good to be true
When we were young and free, and unafraid
And when time was on our side
Wasn't it good, as long as we still had hope
And firmly believed, that we had the strength to cope
With whatever would come and stand in our way
When we thought the life ahead of us
Would unfold to our demands
Wasn't It Good

In life we get a thousand chances
But less they get with every year
We hoped that time would be on our side
But it moved on and left us here

Wasn't it good, good just the way it was
Wasn't it good, before we first tasted loss
When it felt real, and not too good to be true
When we were young and free, and unafraid
And when time was on our side
Wasn't it good, as long as we still had hope
And firmly believed, that we had the strength to cope
With whatever would come and stand in our way
When we thought the life ahead of us
Would unfold to our demands
Wasn't It Good
Wasn't It Good
Wasn't It Good
Wasn't It Good
