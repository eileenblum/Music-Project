So tired of living in this exile I once chose
Sheltered by a levy I have built with my own hands
So tired of waiting for the flood to take me in
Or a ship to pick me up and carry me to solid land
From all I know and all I've seen
There's not a lot left in between
It's a choice to either do or die
A choice you've got to make
Catch that ship right on time
Wherever it may sail
Catch that ship right on time
Your choice will tip the scale
Catch that ship right on time
Don't be left behind
So tired of walking in someone else's shoes
Of being hooked on dreams so vague, that were not meant for me
So tired of paying someone else's dues
Of seeking the warmth of a sun that I will never see
From all I know and all I've seen
There's not a lot left in between
It's a choice to either do or die
A choice you've got to make
Catch that ship right on time
Wherever it may sail
Catch that ship right on time
Your choice will tip the scale
Catch that ship right on time
Don't be left behind
We're islanders, both you and me
Trapped on an island on our own
To share a form of loneliness
That company won't ease
The sea around that has no end
Taught us there's no solid land
For islanders like you
For islanders like me
From all I know and all I've seen
There's not a lot left in between
It's a choice to either do or die
A choice you've got to make
Catch that ship right on time
Wherever it may sail
Catch that ship right on time
Your choice will tip the scale
Catch that ship right on time
Don't be left behind
