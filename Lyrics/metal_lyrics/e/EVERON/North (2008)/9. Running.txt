Days feel like minutes
A lifetime is rushing by
You are moving in circles
It seems you're going nowhere

Keep moving, keep moving

At night you can't find sleep
And your headaches don't go away
Always giving your best
Knowing it won't be near enough

Keep moving, keep moving
Always keep moving
Or be removed

So what is that mission we're on
And when did I sign in
Is there anything in it for me at all

Still lies the ocean wide
And I hear it's calling me
To a place beyond wrong and right
Where the sky meets the sea

There's a deadline approaching
Your tax statement's overdue
An invoice unsettled
And too many bills to be paid

Keep pushing, keep pushing

There's a loan from the bank
A sales-target out of reach
A project waiting in the pipeline
And another one unfinished still

Keep pushing, keep pushing
Always keep pushing
Or be pushed around

So what is that mission we're on
And when did I sign in
Is there anything in it for me at all

Still lies the ocean wide
And I hear it's calling me
To a place beyond wrong and right
Where the sky meets the sea
Still lies the ocean deep
Such grace never met the eye
A whole world in peaceful sleep
Under a star covered sky

It's a rat race we're in
And this game that we play
Has no winner, just losers
Or total refusers that just break away

All your friends feel neglected
And your wife says that you don't care
And they all have a point
But there is a job to be done

So keep running, keep running
Always keep running
Until your time has run out

So what is that mission we're on
And when did I sign in
Is there anything in it for me at all

Still lies the ocean wide
And I hear it's calling me
To a place beyond wrong and right
Where the sky meets the sea
Still lies the ocean deep
Such grace never met the eye
A whole world in peaceful sleep
Under a star covered sky
