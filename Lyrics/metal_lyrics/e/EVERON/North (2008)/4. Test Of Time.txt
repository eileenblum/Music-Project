I was born
As just another small town boy in '69
I had only little worries on my mind
The world seemed kind when I was young
An endless gentle flow of days
Not a lot in life seemed really serious

As time moved on
There were lots of things I had to learn
Such as, if you want to take you've got to
Give a little in return
And though life seemed gentle still
Somehow it got slightly more serious

A winner, in our times, is someone
Who sells his soul at the highest price
To be a slave to profession
Slave to the grind
To whatever other master

The test of time shows what we're made of
The test of time will reveal the truth
The test of time will see us stay afloat or drown, win or lose

All at once
We look back on the best days of our lives
Find out none of our teenage dreams hold water
By the age of thirty-five
Time's not in endless supply
And that's why all in life is serious

A winner, in our times, is someone
Who sells his soul at the highest price
To be a slave to profession
Slave to the grind
To whatever other master

The test of time shows what we're made of
The test of time will reveal the truth
The test of time will see us stay afloat or drown, win or lose
The test of time tells how much we can carry
The test of time will see us flex or break
The test of time will show no mercy, time never waits
