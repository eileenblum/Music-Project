They reach out to the world
They carry our fortune
Written firmly into their palm
They may tremble and shiver
When we need it the least
But as well they may be all safe and calm

They give and take
They tease and taunt
They salute or wave goodbye

They caress a lover
Pull the trigger of a gun
Sign a treaty that seals the peace
They build cars and houses
And at times they save a life
Or go spreading the disease

They give and take
They tease and taunt
They salute or wave goodbye
They push and shove
They clutch and cling
Or hold somebody tight

It's all in those hands
They can do so much good
Can be so destructive
Hands shape the world
Hands break it down

They may clench into fists
Or as well be opened wide
Invite you or push you back
They may pin the words down
Of the book that will change your life
Or close around a victim's neck

They give and take
They tease and taunt
They salute or wave goodbye
They push and shove
They clutch and cling
Or hold somebody tight

It's all in those hands
They can do so much good
Can be so destructive
Hands shape the world
Hands break it down
Hands build it up again
