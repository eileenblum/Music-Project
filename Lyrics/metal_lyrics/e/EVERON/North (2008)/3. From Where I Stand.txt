You've been my last outpost
Before the wild open sea
Suddenly promising rescue when I
Was just about to give in
But could it be, could it be
I just fooled myself

I've been your last wall of defence
Against the truth flooding in
You were dying of thirst and so gladly you drank
When I offered you poison for wine
But could it be, could it be
You just fooled yourself

From where I stand
It all seems pretty clear
From where I stand
There is not much left but fear
Not much left but fear...

Of being alone once again
So we close our eyes and count slowly to ten
Giving truth time enough to get out of our sight
When we seek we make sure we don't find
If ignorance was really bliss
Then the world's seen no happier couple than this
You and I struggling to not get too close
While our hearts are so firmly entwined

We're a match made in heaven
For a life down in hell
A broken promise to ease each other's pain
A cure failing to deliver relief
So could it be, could it be
We just fooled ourselves

From where I stand
It all seems pretty clear
From where I stand
There is not much left but fear
Not much left but fear...

Of being alone once again
So we close our eyes and count slowly to ten
Giving truth time enough to get out of our sight
When we seek we make sure we don't find
If ignorance was really bliss
Then the world's seen no happier couple than this
You and I struggling to not get too close
While our hearts are so firmly entwined

So we are watching our world slowly turn into grey
While fear drives its claws
Deeper into our flesh with every new day

From where I stand
It all seems pretty clear
From where I stand
There is not much left but fear
Not much left but fear...
Of being alone once again
So we close our eyes and count slowly to ten
Giving truth time enough to get out of our sight
And when we seek we make sure we don't find
If ignorance was really bliss
Then the world's seen no happier couple than this
You and I struggling to not get too close
While our hearts are so firmly entwined

So we are watching our world slowly turn into grey
