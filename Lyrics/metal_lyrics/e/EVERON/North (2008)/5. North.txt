Late at night we grab our things
Take the car and hit the road
Follow the old familiar trace
Laid in our secret code

The same old village by the sea
Once a second home for you and me

As we drive all through the night
We both don't dare to speak
So afraid we won't succeed
In finding what we seek

The same old village by the sea
Home of all our memories
That will hurt, rather than do us good

Life taught us many lessons
I thought we learned those lessons well
We should be old enough to face it
But we both don't say a word
Just speechlessly drive South
While emotionally, it feels
We're heading North

There are things that fall to dust
As soon as touched for real
(They're) meant to be kept safe deep inside
And not to be revealed

The same old village by the sea
Covered by the dust of centuries
That wiped out all the traces we had left

Life taught us many lessons
I thought we learned those lessons well
We should be old enough to face it
But we both don't say a word
Just speechlessly drive South
While emotionally, it feels
We're heading North
