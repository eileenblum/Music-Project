Try to take my breath away
As long as I'm still breathing
Try to take my breath away
As long as you still can

Try to make me burn for you
Boil my blood until it's screaming
Try to make me burn for you
As long as you still can

Only tonight I'll be yours
When the morning breaks I will be gone for sure
I won't wait for you to leave me
So I will leave you instead
Never again love will kill me
Because I am already dead

Try to feel this heart of mine
As long as it's still beating
Try to feel this heart of mine
As long as you still can

Try to taste this blood of mine
As long as I'm still bleeding
Try to taste this blood of mine
As long as you still can

Only tonight I'll be yours...

If I had, if I only had
A heart to give, I'd surely give it to you

If I had, if I only had
A heart to give then I would gladly
I'd gladly make it yours

Only tonight I'll be yours...
