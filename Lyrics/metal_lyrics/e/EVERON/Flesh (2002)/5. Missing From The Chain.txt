If you feel, that you once loved
Too much to ever love again
Don't think nobody else
Feels the same or understands

Half my life, I've been waiting just like you
Half the world, I've travelled all in vain
Half my life, I've been searching just like you
To find that link gone missing from the chain

In a thousand miles of crashing waves
Just once, one might kiss the shore
And so does love take its time
But is still worth waiting for

Half my life...
