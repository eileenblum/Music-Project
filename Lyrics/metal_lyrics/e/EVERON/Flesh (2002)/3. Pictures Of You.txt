I had a dream of you tonight
I've been dreaming of a life we'd share
But when my hand reached out for you
I noticed there was no one there

Will you ever show up
Will you ever come here
And if you do, please give me a sign

To make sure I notice it's you
And not just anyone again

Before sunrise I woke up
I got up early on my feet
Knocked at the door of every house
Called out for you in every street

Will you ever show up...

I have never seen your face
I don't even know your name
So right now, all that I can do
While I sit and wait

Is painting pictures
Pictures of you
