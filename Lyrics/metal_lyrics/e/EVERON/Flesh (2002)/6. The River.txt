So what you're really trying to say
Is you don't want me to stand in your way
Is that all that you feel right now

My Dear, I wish that you would understand
Sometimes things just go out of hand
And some things just happen somehow

For a shred of hope you would follow the devil
For a sense of bliss you would sell all of your dreams
For a trace of love we may lose mind completely
And there is not a lot that we can do

Is there nothing that we could do...

Are we caught up in that river's flow
And for every new way that we go
Do we have to leave something behind

My Dear, it's that river that gives and that takes
So for every new turn that it makes
We lose one thing but another we find

For a shred of hope...

How many times did I wish I could just end this pain
That I could go back in time
To where it began and then start again

Well, if we could so, it would be so easy to make amends
But the river doesn't stand still
And the river just gives no second chance

Is there nothing that we could do...
