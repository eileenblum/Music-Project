It's a golden age you say
But not for those
That choose to go their way
And not the way you chose
Why do you tell your son
What he has got to do
Why do you want him
To become exactly like you ?

In the end he will learn to know better
Than to trust in somebody like you

I don't believe in democracy's voice
I won't rely on a king to be wise
I won't give in to the majority's choice
Because I don't think that the majority's right

In the end I learnt to know better
Than to trust in the majority

So this time I won't be a victim
In all of these years I have learned to defend
My army's marched up and my strategy's clear
I'm back in the real life again

So watch out, I'll shoot without warning
If you get too close I will bite
We're always pretending to be civilized
Behaving like cavemen

A chain will only be as strong
As its weakest link
I won't rely on your tribal spirit
Because to me it is nothing but herd instinct

In the end I learnt to know better
Than to trust in a tribe like this
So this time I won't be a victim
In all of these years I have learned to defend
My army's marched up and my strategy's clear
I'm back in the real life again

So watch out, I'll shoot without warning
Don't get too close, I will bite
We're always pretending to be civilized
Behaving like cavemen

In the end I learnt to know better
Than to trust in a tribe like this
So this time I won't be a victim
In all of these years I have learned to defend
My army's marched up and my strategy's clear
I'm back in the real life again

So watch out, I'll shoot without warning
Don't get too close, I will bite
We're always pretending to be civilized
Behaving like cavemen
