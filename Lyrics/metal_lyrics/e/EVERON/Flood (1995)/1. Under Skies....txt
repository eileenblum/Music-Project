A cold winter's night
Quiet and black
There's no one but us
And the whole world stands back
While we lose ourselves
In stories we tell

Suddenly everything changes
As we open doors into a different world
Everything that I knew
Seems to become untrue
And the sky changes colours
From grey into blue

Why wonder what's won
Why wonder what's lost
Why wonder if what we have
Was worth the cost
When we have all
That we could ever need to have

Sometimes we all feel discouraged
Are tired and sad
Or just in a strange mood
In the darkest of hours
Faced with the bitter truth
We need to find ways to make
Grey skies seem blue

So come on paint your grey skies blue
