Big sun, up in the sky
You burn my skin
And you hurt my eyes

Big river, closing in upon us
Our lives are swept away
In your floods that rise

The farmer lays the crop
Down into deadly ground
Growing our children's food

One day I walked in a river bed
A silent trace of waters that once flew
One day I stood on a mountain top
The world below was not the one I knew

We dance and laugh out in the acid rain
Are we travellers on a ship of fools ?

Are we all blind
Are we all blind or maybe
We just don't want to see
But want to trust that man on TV
Who's saying everything's going to be alright
Be alright for you and me
We walk right on the edge of nowhere
With our heads held high
And obviously nobody cares
They all walk on by
As if they were not concerned at all

You better look twice
At each line in the papers
You better look twice
At that man on TV
You better look twice
Into the eyes of your leaders
Or just look around
See the dying world
Don't you see it fade away
In silent grace

One day I walked in a river bed
A silent trace of waters that once flew
One day I stood on a mountain top
The world below was not the one I knew

We dance and laugh out in the acid rain
Are we travellers on a ship of fools ?

Are we all blind
Are we all blind or maybe
We just don't want to see
But want to trust that man on TV
Who's saying everything's going to be alright
Be alright for you and me
We walk right on the edge of nowhere
With our heads held high
And obviously nobody cares
They all walk on by
As if they were not concerned at all
