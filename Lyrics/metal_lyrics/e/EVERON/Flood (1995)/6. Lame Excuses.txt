I may not be one to rely on
Too often I'm not even there
It may be that I don't care
The way I should do
And all of that may be unfair

I know it's true
That I could have made more out of my life
But we have us, and bit of all we need
So I won't complain
And I need no lame excuses
To be just what I am
Nothing more

Probably it's true
That I am sometimes too proud
Of a career that might be even
Not worth talking about

I know that all our friends
Might make more money than I do
But I don't want to be in their shoes
Because that's my point of view

I know it's true
That I could have made more out of my life
But we have us, and bit of all we need
So I won't complain
And I need no lame excuses
To be just what I am
Nothing more

I could be a man of means
With a big house and a limousine
I could be all of that and more
And I could work all day
And work all night as well
Oh yes, I know
I know too well

That it's true
That I could have made more out of my life
But we have us, and a bit of all we need
So I won't complain
And I need no lame excuses
To be just what I am
Nothing more

None of us would need any lame excuses
If we were what we are
Nothing more
