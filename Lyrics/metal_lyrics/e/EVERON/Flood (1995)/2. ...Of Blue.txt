So here I am
Just a man with his empty hands
Right here I'd go down on my knees
And offer submission
If it made my grey skies blue

So hear my call
Well, it won't make no difference at all
Right here I would speak any vow
And promise I'd give
If it made my grey skies blue

I know that I have a habit
Of taking things too hard
How often you've almost got mad about that

Well, I know what you mean
When you say things are never as bad as they seem
Although I don't really think
That you are truly right
Every word I'll deny
If I get through this night

So here I am
Just a man with his empty hands
Right here I'd go down on my knees
And offer submission
If it made my grey skies blue

So hear my call
Well, it won't make no difference at all
Right here I would speak any vow
And promise I'd give
If it made my grey skies blue

Sometimes I wonder
Why we try to plan anything at all
It never works out
And life goes on its own secret ways

When I feel like I'm losing my grip
I remind you still saying
"Those days won't last forever,
I swear you'll be back under skies of blue"

Well, I know what you mean
When you say life is not as unfair as it seems
Although I don't really think
That you are truly right
Every word I'll deny
If I get through this night

So here I am
Just a man with his empty hands
Right here I'd go down on my knees
And offer submission
If it made my grey skies blue

So hear my call
Well, it won't make no difference at all
Right here I would speak any vow
And promise I'd give
If it made my grey skies blue
