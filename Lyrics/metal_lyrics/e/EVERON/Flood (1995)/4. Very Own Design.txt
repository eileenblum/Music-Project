Catch a dream and let it
Take you by the hand
Follow your imagination
And you will discover wonderland
That place is nowhere to be found
But once in a while it may come around
You won't find it if you seek
But it can find you any time

Into clear water I look down
And I see strange creatures moving around
Is it a completely different world
Or a reflection that I see

A strange place is where they live
In a fragile dream they act as if
They were the only ones around
And that world was
Their very own design

Call it kind of madness
Call it just a dream
Call it lack of reason
Or you can call it lack of self-esteem

Sometimes when there is no way out
It may be wise to take the way inside
When you come back
You see thing clearer every time

Into clear water I look down
And I see strange creatures moving around
Is it a completely different world
Or a reflection that I see

A strange place is where they live
In a fragile dream they act as if
They were the only ones around
And that world was
Their very own design

We work hard all our lifetime
For a little place to call our own
Or anything, strong enough for clutching at
We're driven to go on and on
To ignore our broken pride, our broken hearts
And all those broken dreams we had

Take me away
I want to lay that pressure down
The daily treadmill eats us up
And when it spits us out again
We all have gone half the way to insanity
So what else could keep our souls alive but the hope
There's more to our lives
That there's another wilder bright reality

Take me away
I want to lay that pressure down
This is more than I can take

Sometimes when there is no way out
It may be wise to take the way inside
When you come back
You see things clearer every time

Into clear water I dive down
And I touch the creatures moving around
This is a completely different world
But truly this is real

A strange place is where we live
And from down here it looks as if
We were the only ones around
And this world was
Our very own design
