The wind and the rain
And the deep blue sea
Ahead and around
As far as the eye can see
Is it only cheap comfort
Or an easy way out
But did I have any choice
But breaking out ?

What good is a life
If all that it brings
Is the pain and frustration
To dance on the strings
What good is a man
If he's got nothing to give
If he's too strong to die
But too weak to live ?
