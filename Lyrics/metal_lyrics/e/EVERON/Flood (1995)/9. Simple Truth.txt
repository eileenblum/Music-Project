We have done everything to hurt
The other in this war without a word
We have fought for things that hardly were
Worth thinking about, so why don't you prefer
To break the silence
And put the weapons down
We can talk it over - still

Somehow we seem to have dislearned
To communicate, and that's why we have turned
To a form of silent conversation
That led us straight into alienation

I almost can't believe
That this is us, still you and me
That we just don't speak no more
What happened to the ones
We have been before ?

Sometimes we just don't understand
That the stone we kick away
Is a precious diamond 'til it's gone

Sometimes we have to speak our mind
Just to get the proof
That there never is a simple truth

If you had let me be the one I am
If I had let you be the one you are
If we both had sometimes tried to understand
Certainly it would never have come that far

I almost can't believe
That this is us, still you and me
That we sit right here
With our lips sealed tight
Instead of speaking it out
To make everything turn out right

Sometimes we just don't understand
That the stone we kick away
Is a precious diamond 'til it's gone

Sometimes we have to speak our mind
Just to get the proof
That there never is a simple truth

Well, I know
For you it's perfectly clear
What is going on here
That's your simple truth
Don't you know
I've got my own point of view
That might be just as true
As your simple truth
So turn around and open up your mouth
And speak your mind

I almost can't believe
That this is us, still you and me
We could make it right
Or break it up instead
But anyway we should not forget
We never know what we'll find
But we know what we leave behind

Sometimes we just don't understand
That the stone we kick away
Is a precious diamond 'til it's gone

Sometimes we have to speak our mind
Just to get the proof
That there never is a simple truth
