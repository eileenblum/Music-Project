There's a black river flowing
A poisoned stream
Out of nowhere it comes
And nowhere it leads
There's no today, and no tomorrow

That river is fed
By the dark thoughts of those
That have a black heart inside
And I feel how I get close
To them myself, in all my sorrow
And the river starts dragging me in

Silently I watched and waited
Each and every night
You should have anticipated
That something was not right

Would you hold the line
In days like these my friend
Would you hold the line
Or would you cut it off at your end

Something crawls out of the river
Something crawls all over my skin
Something is trying to get hold of my heart
I'm losing my sense of direction
And I cannot remember
Anything but the world fading to grey
As the river is dragging me in

Silently I watched and waited
Each and every night
You should have anticipated
That something was not right

Would you hold the line
In days like these my friend
Would you hold the line
Or would you cut it off at your end

In a short clear moment
I force all my resistance
So I stretch out my hands to reach out
For the river's bank

I'm not yet ready to go under
I'm not yet giving up
There still is a chance to find
Someone that's worth
Taking any risk, and taking on any fight
That makes me put all of these sorrows aside
Sometimes it takes just a word
To save a life

So if you get to that river one day
You better take my advice
Don't forget what I say
It's not too late to turn around
So don't let it drag you in

Would you hold the line
In days like these my friend
Would you hold the line
Or would you cut it off at your end

Would you hold the line
