In a silent world
I had lived without sight or sound
In all that time

You know I felt that shame
But I put the blame on everyone around
In all that time

And I had lost all of my power, my faith and my belief
In all that time
And I had lost those wings that carried me
To any place I longed to be
In all that time

I should have
Let you know one thing
That what you saw
Was just my shadow

A picture black and white
The colours shining bright
Were washed away
In that rain still falling down on me

Was all that a curse
Whatever promised to get better
Turned out worse
In all that time

I lived under that spell
I was caught in my own private hell
In all that time

And I had lost all of my power, my faith and my belief
In all that time
And I had lost all hope
I was clutching at a burning rope
Helpless like a child
In all that time

I should have
Let you know one thing
That what you saw
Was just my shadow

A skeleton disguised
A soul devitalised
A body caught in automation

I lay awake that night
Wishing you could hold me tight
I could as well have been dead
I never dared to say the words I should have said
I should have known
That it won't get better just by waiting
Or telling myself
That I would try to be a better man
And I should have known
That I ran away too often
Instead of moving on

In a silent world
I had lived without sight or sound
In all that time

You felt my distress
And I can only guess
What you've been through
In all that time

I should have let you know
That I had lost all of my power, my faith and my belief
In all that time
And I had lost all hope
I was clutching at a burning rope
Helpless like a child
In all that time

I should have
Let you know one thing
That what you saw
Was just my shadow

A skeleton disguised
A soul devitalised
A body caught in automation

I lay awake that night
Wishing you could hold me tight
I could as well have been dead
I never dared to say the words I should have said
I should have known
That it won't get better just by waiting
Or telling myself
That I would try to be a better man
And I should have known
That I ran away too often
Instead of moving on
Instead of moving on
