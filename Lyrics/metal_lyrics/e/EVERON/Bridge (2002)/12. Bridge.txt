I know that you are worth waiting for
But I don't have the time
I've been waiting for years already
But that didn't make you mine

My clock is ticking faster
Than I ever thought it would
So I can't wait for your love
God knows I wish I could

Right there in the mist before me
I see its ghostly scheme
Stretching cast-iron fingers
Upon a blood-red stream

This bridge has been the hope of many
For just as many it has been the end
Now I'm the next in line to lay my life
Faithfully into this hand

I know that you are worth waiting for
But I don't have the time
I've been waiting for years already
But that didn't make you mine

My clock is ticking faster
Than I ever thought it would
So I can't wait for your love
God knows I wish I could

There's a bridge ahead that spans a river wide
If you don't dare the walk, you won't reach my side

If you walk that bridge, the bridge may break
But that's a risk that you will have to take

If it breaks, the river takes you in
And a whole new journey will begin

There's a secret down in that river deep
But those who find it don't come back to speak
