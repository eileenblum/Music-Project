Around the world in just one day
Is way too fast, or so they say
But whenever we're together
We can easily go round twice

You're all I need and more
All I've been hoping for
But we both know it is
Not our turn this time

Up and down at rapid speed
Inside out I'm turned indeed
As soon as the command is yours
My whole world seems to change

You shine much brighter than
All the stars, but then again
Alas, it seems you came here
Just a bit too late

In another time, and in another place
Surely you'd be mine, but not here and now
I wish you would understand
You're ten years late
I wish you would understand
You're ten years late

And if you were the only rose
That stands in bloom amid all the weed
Still that won't help, and even if
In this world of willows, in which we live
You were the only giant
That won't change a single thing

In another time, and in another place
Surely you'd be mine, but not here and now
I wish you would understand
You're ten years late
I wish you would understand
You're ten years late
