My dear old friend, I hope you will forgive
If you feel left alone, if you feel left alone

We had been friends for too long
To be anything but that
And that's a thing I should have known

A funny couple we must have seemed, you and I
I was trying so hard to fall in love with you

But you had your travelling shoes already on
While I was so obviously still wearing her tattoo...

My dear old friend, I hope you will forgive
If you're running from me, then please don't run too far

We've been friends for too long
To ever let that go
So I hope, this is still what we are...
