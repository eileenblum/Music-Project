I'd go working in daytime
Instead of staying out all night
And if I felt bad and sick
I'd pretend I'm alright

Every day I'd bring you flowers
I'd go walking your dog
I would do it all right this time

I wouldn't mind doing the dishes
I would not let you wait
Would play your favourite records
And pretend they're just great

And if you like I'd sell my car
And ride a bike instead
I would do it all right this time

And I swear I'd still be right here in twenty-five years from now
And I'd mean it when I say I love you, and I'd let it show
Each day I'm alive I would only live to make you feel fine
All that and more I would do
If you were still mine...

I'd join you on those parties
And pretend I have fun
I'd see the bright side of things
Even if there is none

And I would swallow all my fear
To not make you concerned
I would do it all right this time

And when you're lying to yourself
I'd notice but wouldn't tell
Whenever you're fooling yourself
I'd let you fool me as well

So if my eyes were your mirror
I'd swear you'd like what you see
I would do it all right this time

And I swear I'd still be right here in twenty-five years from now
And I'd mean it when I say I love you, and I'd let it show
Each day I'm alive I would only live to make you feel fine
All that and more I would do
If you were still mine...
