Bound to a vow that you once gave
To keep that secret 'til they take you to grave
To all the world you show a smiling face

But inside of you pain burns like hell
Only breaking the silence will break the spell
But inside of you pain burns like hell
Only breaking the silence will break the spell

Twenty years have passed and nothing has changed
For all the world to see your life's well arranged
You've never said a word to anyone

But inside of you pain burns like hell
Only breaking the silence will break the spell
But inside of you pain burns like hell
Only breaking the silence will break the spell

So was he worth your loyalty ?
So was he worth the pain you feel ?
Will you ever see
That your bravery is just slavery ?
So don't be afraid of life
It's good that you're alive
You're still alive

The fault for which you pay is not your own
The silence that you chose turns you into stone
Yours you make the blame, that should be his

But inside of you pain burns like hell
Only breaking the silence will break the spell
But inside of you pain burns like hell
Only breaking the silence will break the spell

So was he worth your loyalty ?
So was he worth the pain you feel ?
Will you ever see
That your bravery is just slavery ?
So don't be afraid of life
It's good that you're alive
And life goes on...

Why can't you forget the shame
Why don't you call him by his name
And point your finger straight at him
Don't be afraid no more

He can't break you
Don't let him break you
He won't break you
Not this time, not this way...
