We're born wild and free
And everything seems to make sense
But the trouble starts
As soon as man tries to make amends

From times of hardship to times of bliss
We ponder over the same old questions
Until we understand life is...

A way that twists and turns
The fire that always burns
It's the riddle no one solves
Around which the world revolves

It's an endless walk uphill
Until fear submits to will
It's our plans gone out of hand
A wild flight across the land

It's a rapid journey
And wherever it may lead
We're all just passengers
That don't know who's in the driver's seat

From times of hardship to times of bliss
We ponder over the same old questions
Until we understand life is...

A way that twists and turns
The fire that always burns
It's the riddle no one solves
Around which the world revolves

It's an endless walk uphill
Until fear submits to will
It's our plans gone out of hand
A wild flight across the land

I read all those good books, that claim to hold the key
But at last they all just made no sense to me
Behind walls of science, moral, faith or spirituality
No matter where you hide life catches up with you eventually

It's the twinkle in her eye
A train that passed you by
It's the love you left behind
And the sense you could not find

A system overload
A path that leads abroad
It's a chance you did not use
The hand that you refused

A way that twists and turns...
