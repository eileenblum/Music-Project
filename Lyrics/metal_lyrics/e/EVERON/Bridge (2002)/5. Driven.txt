I've been roaming about the streets of New York City
I've been strolling down the beaches of South France
I've been to the desert, I've been to Scandinavia

Some have it all but don't see what they're given
Some always lose but still they keep on trying
I wish that I could have that gift of feeling happy
Even if inside you really feel like crying

God knows I've tried hard to forgive her
God knows I've tried hard to forget her
God knows I've loved, God knows I've given
God knows I'm mad, God knows I'm driven

I tried to hide away in lonely places
Tried to disappear in crowded city streets
I've been seeking comfort in too many cold embraces

Some still feel the warmth upon their skin
Long after the sun's already gone
I wish that I could have that gift of feeling rich
Even if you hardly have enough to get along

God knows I've tried hard to forgive her
God knows I've tried hard to forget her
God knows I've loved, God knows I've given
God knows I'm mad, God knows I'm driven

Wherever I've been going to
Trying to escape from you
You've been there
You've been waiting there...
