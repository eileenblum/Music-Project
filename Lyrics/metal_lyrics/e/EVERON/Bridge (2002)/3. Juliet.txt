What a happy couple
These two used to be
Just like Romeo and Juliet
In perfect harmony

See them now...

Every secret wish he ever had
She read from his eyes
And so did he with hers
To her great delight
Such true luck don't come often
But when it comes, then it comes

See them now...
Take a look at them now

In her eyes, in her eyes
There was all he desired
For a love that would last forever and a day

On their way to heaven
Somehow they both lost track
Just a few steps off the main road
But enough to not find a way back

See them now...

His sensitivity she loved
Did last just for a while
So did her bedroom voice
And her Sunday smile
Her true face doesn't show often
But when it shows, then it shows

See them now...
Take a look at them now

In her eyes, in her eyes
There was all he desired
For a love that would last forever and a day

In her eyes, in her eyes
He sees all he despises
As all her disguises
Got lost along the way

Romeo is bleeding
While Juliet gladly smiles
'Cause only when he's bleeding
Juliet feels alright

In her eyes, in her eyes
There was all he desired
For a love that would last forever and a day

In her eyes, in her eyes
He sees all he despises
As all her disguises
Got lost along the way

Romeo is bleeding
While Juliet gladly smiles
'Cause only when he's bleeding
Juliet feels alright

She knows that she can kill him
With just a word or two
So the last thing that he heard
Was her voice saying "I love you"
