Your life and you, always had different plans
And never shared one point of view
So no one even comes halfway near you
In terms of making their life a mess

My life and me, we've never been best friends
But somehow learnt to coexist
Why be afraid of things getting even worse
They're already as bad as can be

But after all, what it boils down to is
Whatever we need is right here by our side

When the rain goes down
When the rain goes down
When it pours out over you
Then I will harbour you
Until the sun comes out

It seems you and I
We were made for each other
Though naturally we'd both disagree

If you take the elevator
Then I will walk the stairs
If you choose coffee
I'll have tea

But after all, what it boils down to is
Whatever we need is right here by our side

When the rain goes down
When the rain goes down
When it pours out over you
Then I will harbour you
Until the sun comes out
