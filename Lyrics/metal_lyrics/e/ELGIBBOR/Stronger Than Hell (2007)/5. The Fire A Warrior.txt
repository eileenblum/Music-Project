When I opened my eyes I saw that I was lost.
Hell was pulling me in,peirced hands were looking for me everywhere.
His word become light and fire was ignited in my heart.
The fire of a warrior.
Without You there is no life.
Without You there is only pain.
and Without You there is darkness.
I need You!!!
