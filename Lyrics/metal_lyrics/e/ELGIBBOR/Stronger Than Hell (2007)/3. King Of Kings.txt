[Revelation 19:17-21]

And i saw an angel standing in the sun
Who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair
"Come gather together for the great supper of God so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slace, small and great"
Then i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armys
gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army. But the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had recieved the mark of the beast and worshiped his image.  The two of them were thrown alive in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.  The rest of them were killed with the sword that caem out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
