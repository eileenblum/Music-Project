[Some excerpts taken from "King Arthur"]

Born of the Spirit
Knights of Christ
Conquerors of evil, living in faith
Undefeated Immortals
Shield of faith
Sword of the Spirit
Breastplate of Righteousness
Purchased, set appart and called
Let us lift up His banner and glory in His victory!
Let us give our glory to our King
Maranatha
Let the Kingdom of the Lord come
