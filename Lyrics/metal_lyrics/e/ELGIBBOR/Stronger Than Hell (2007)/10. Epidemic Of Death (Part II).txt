God shaping doom against you
Laying plans against you
But if you repent of your wicked lives
Turn back from your from your doomed way of life
And straighten out your lives
He will then turn to you
Messiah will save you
(based on Jeremiah chapter 18)
You are criminals 
After all you've done to our God
There's still mercy for you
Repent from your sins, and you will save life
Straight your ways and you will forever live
Swallow Gods Word and you will never starve
Follow Christ to Fathers Home, theres a place for everyone.

[Based on Jeremiah and John]
