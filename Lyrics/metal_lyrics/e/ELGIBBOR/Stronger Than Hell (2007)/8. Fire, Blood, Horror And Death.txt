Heroes are going forth because they have faith
After darkness, comes a new day
A light in the darkness is lit
They are riding horses, going to war to fight the last battle
Through fire, through blood, through honor and death
Victory is near. Free the slaves, cast out the enemy
Lift up the victory cry!
