Stand,sons of light,to fight in this dark time.
Take up your weapons,draw your swords,
let your hearts be clean from darkness
so that you shine like stars in a dark sky.
So that you can save those who fell.
The enemy has no mercy,for his end is coming soon.
And all will be changed .Our Strenght is in the Lord!!
