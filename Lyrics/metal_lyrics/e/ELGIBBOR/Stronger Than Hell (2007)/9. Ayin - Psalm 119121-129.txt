I have done justice and righteousnessDo not leave me to my oppressorsBe surely for Your servant for good;Do not let the proud oppress meMy eyes fail from seeking Your salvationAnd Your righteous wordDeal with Your servant according to Your mercyAnd teach me Your statutesI am your servantGive me understandingThat I may know Your testimoniesIt is time for You to act, O LordFor they have regarded Your law as voidTherefore I love Your commandmentsMore than Gold, yes then fine GoldTherefore all your precepts concerning all thingsI consider to be right;I hate every false way
