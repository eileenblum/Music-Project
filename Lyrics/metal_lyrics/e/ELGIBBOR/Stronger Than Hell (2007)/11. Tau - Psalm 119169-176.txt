Let my cry come before You, O LordGive me understanding according to Your wordLet my supplication come before youDeliver me according to Your wordMy lips shall utter praiseFor You teach me Your statutesMy tongue shall speak of Your wordFor all Your commandments are righteousness Let Your hand become my helpFor i have chosen Your precepts I long for your salvation, O LordAnd Your law is my delightLet my soul live, and it shall praise Youand Let your judgments help meI have gone astray like a lost sheepSeek your ServantFor i do not forget Your commandments
