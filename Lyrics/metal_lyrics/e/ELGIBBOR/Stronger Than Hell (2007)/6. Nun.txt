[Psalm 119:106-112]

Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. 
I have sworn and confirmed that i will keep your righteous judgments
I am afflicted very much
Revive me, O Lord, according to Your word
Accept, I pray the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord
And teach me your judgments
My life is continuall in my hand, yet i dont forget Your law
The wicked have laid a share for me, yet i have not strayed from your precepts 
Your testimonies i have taken as a heritage forever
For they are the rejoicing of my heart
I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes 
Forever to the very end
