Forever, O LordYour word is settled in heavenYour faithfullness endures to all generationsYou established the earth and it abidesThey continue this day according to Your ordinances For all are Your servantsUnless Your law had been my delightI would then have perished in my afflictionI will never forget Your perceptsFor by them You have given my lifeThe wicked wait for me to destroy meBut i will consider Your testimoniesI have seen the consummation of all perfectionBut your commandment is exceedingly broad.
