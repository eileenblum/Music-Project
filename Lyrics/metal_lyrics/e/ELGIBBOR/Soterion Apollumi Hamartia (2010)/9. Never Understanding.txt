"You will be ever hearing but never understanding;you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.For this people's heart has become calloused;they hardly hear with their ears,and they have closed their eyes.Otherwise they might see with their eyes,hear with their ears,understand with their heartsand turn, and I would heal them. But blessed are your eyesbecause they see, and your ears because they hear. For I tellyou the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to seewhat you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear butdid not hear it."
