The old captain is dead, now a new one must lead the King's army.The new captain is afraid of the commitment to conquer a new land, but his King gives him words of courage..."I've commanded you to be strong and brave. Don't ever be afraid or discouraged! I am a Mighty King, your King, and I will be there to help you wherever you go." This new captain is younger but stronger; his King has all his trust in him, the King knows that He made a good choice. He is ready to fight against the foe! He has his sword in his right hand and his shield on his left arm. He will fight and conquer under his King's name! He knows that the victory is ensured. The enemy feared when he heard the King's name and rand away from the army's king. The warrior fights with no fear and the enemy falls before him. All the enemy is dead. In the warrior's mind are only thankful praises to his King, because there is no one like Him.
