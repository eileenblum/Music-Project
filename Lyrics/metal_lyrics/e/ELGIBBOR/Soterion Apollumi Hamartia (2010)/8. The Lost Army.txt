Loud marches the army of cheated soulsDeaf to the sound of the words of freedom.Their lord is the Ruler of this worldA black soul Emperor of the cheated.He speaks freedom and promises golden hillsHe is the Ruler of hypocritesA wolf in sheep's clothingHe wants to rule youHe wants to take away your freedomSo you will serve him unknowinglyHe wants to give you a number, the mark of the beast from hellHe creates his own religion so that you will never be freeDon't be deaf in the last daysDon't let the angel of cheated power and the army of darknessCome into your lifeOnly the Creator gives freedom, and that freedom is in the bloodPoured out for your freedom, to pay for your freedom
