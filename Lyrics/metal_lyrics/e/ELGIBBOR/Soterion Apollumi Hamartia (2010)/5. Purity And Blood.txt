White like purity, red like blood poured out to be free
They think that they can use the name of God to kill the innocent people
But they have never really met the one true God
They used the inquisitions for their own interest and hid behind the reason
That they were doing it for God
The True God gave you freedom by letting you choose which road to take
With only religion there is no freedom
The truth is found in a true relationship with God
