Hello lord inquisitor!!!Who will you accuse today?Who will you condemn to death with your words?You see the mistakes of everyone everywhereYou look everywhere for a reason to tear down the lives of othersDon't you know? Have you not heard of the love of the brothers?Of the love for people.Who are you that you can be so cruel?You really don't know the true God, because your god is a destroyer and a murdererRepent before it's too late!Because your sin is killing you!!!God is the judge--not you!!!
