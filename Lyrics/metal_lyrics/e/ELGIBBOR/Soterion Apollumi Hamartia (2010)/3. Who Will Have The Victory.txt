[Revelation 22v12-13]
[Revelation 22v16-17]
[Psalm 37v39-40]

"On earth as it is in Heaven."
War goes on. Angels fight amongst each other.
Swords are waiting for blood.
Who will have the victory?
The great book, written a long time ago, give us answer
A Great Warrior came to save humankind, to give hope and faith
Just Son, we heed, we have our victory
Forever and ever, forever and ever
