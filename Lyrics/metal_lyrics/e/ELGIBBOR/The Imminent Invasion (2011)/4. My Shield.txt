My shield is broken, my strength is gone
Like a raven the foe is around me
My legs are bleeding because of their arrows
And my sword is not right in my hand.

I lay on the ground crying in despair for help
My foes tell me that no one will hear me
They laugh and spit in my face!
Pain and sorrow invade my heart

I feel new strength that lifts me up
I heard a voice from heaven saying:
But I AM a shield for you, your glory
And I lift up your head.
You should not be afraid of ten thousand foes
They have set themselves against you

My foes run in fear at the Voice
That resonates like thunder in the heavens
Others fall down before that holy Presence
And I stand up in fear and frightened.

O Lord; save me, for thou hast smitten all mine foes against me
On the cheek of bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly
My salvation belongs unto my Lord, Thy blessing is upon us
