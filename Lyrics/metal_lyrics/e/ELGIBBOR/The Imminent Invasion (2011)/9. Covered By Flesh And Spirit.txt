I'm dead by the rotting of my actions
Lawlessness has taken possession of my mind,
My flesh is gone, as are memories of a decent life
Now suffer the consequences of sinful life I chose.
I'm just a skeleton among many others in this valley of dry bones
Inhabited by former servants of the evil angel.
Every sin committed was stake through my heart, and I did not realize "life" took me.
But here we perceive holy steps , made by a prophet of God.
A new breath of life breathed on us.
The muscles atrophied the apostasy now feel the power of divine mercy.
God had mercy on us poor dry bones by sin.
But life in the drought is only a vague bitter memory
March for victory in the name of the Almighty
Covered by flesh and spirit
