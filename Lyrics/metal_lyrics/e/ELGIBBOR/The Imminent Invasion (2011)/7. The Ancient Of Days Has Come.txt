The four beasts shall be A fourth kingdoms on earth,
Which shall be different from all other kingdoms,
And shall devour the whole earth,
Trample it and break it in pieces.
The ten horns are ten kings who shall arise from this kingdom.
And another shall rise after them; 
He shall speak pompous words against the Most High,
Shall persecute the saints of the Most High,
And shall intend to change times and law.
Then the saints shall be given into his hand
For a time and times and half a time.
But the court shall be seated, and they shall take away his dominion,
To consummate and destroy it forever.
Then the kingdom and dominion, and all the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven,
Shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.
His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.
This is the end of the account.
