Mighty Master on a white horseHis feet like steel crush deathThe Fire in His eyesTouches our heartsThe sword from His mouthCuts down the enemyHis voice is like rushing waterThat crushes the tower of evilHe rose from the deadAnd set me free from sinHe took my feet out of the miry mudAnd stood them on the solid rockHe gives his angels charge over meIn His blood was my ransomHis word is lifeMy Lord and Savior is the Victor!!!
