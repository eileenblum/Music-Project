In the north there is a dark valleyWhere you can hear the screams of the battling armies.Many injured, many dead but many still stand.They hold the shield of faith in their hand.A sword comes out of their mouths.The dragon, snake deceiver hides in the darknessBecause God's son has revealed himself.The dragon thought he won by killing him,But the son's sacrifice was so strong that it destroyed all evil.
