[Isaiah 47:1-4]

"Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon;
Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans!
For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
Take the millstones and grind meal.
Remove your feil, take off the skirt, uncover the thigh, pass through the rivers.
Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame will be seen;
I will take vengeance, and I will not arbitrate with a man"

As for our redeemer, the lord of hosts is his name, the holy one of Israel.
