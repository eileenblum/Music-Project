I was the one who condemned him to die,
I was one of them who blasphemed his name,
I was the one who laughed when I saw evil on the Earth,
I thought I was strong and that others didn't matter.
When I saw the place I was blindly headed, Fear gripped my soul.
I saw that hell existed! But when I hear your name, a door opened to heaven.
I saw that heaven existed! I want to live there forever.
With your life is easier. I know you are always close when I need you.
You are mightier than Lucifer the liar. Many souls are still in prison,
Only you give true freedom.
