A young man and his elder stood on the ocean's shore.
The elder was full of power; a prophet of God.
The young man desired the same kind of power; just as his elder had.
He asked his elder, "Can I be your disciple?"
His elder replied, "Are you able to give up everything?"
The young man retorted, "Yes I am!"
His elder took him to the deep water and plunged the young man's head beneath the raging flow.
The young man began to lose his breath.
In the last moment his elder pulled him from the water.
The young man was angered and screamed, "Are you trying to kill me?"
His elder calmly explained, "Just as you need air to live; so do you also need God to survive!"
