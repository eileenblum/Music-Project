[Deuteronomy 32:1-9]

"Give ear, o heavens, and I will speak;
And hear, o earth, the words of my mouth.
Let my teaching drop as the rain,
My speech distill as the dew,
As raindrops on the tender herb,
And as showers on the grass.
For I proclaim the name of the Lord;
Ascribe greatness to our God.
He is the rock, his work is perfect;
For all his ways are justice,
A God of truth and without injustice;
Righteous and upright is he."
"They have corrupted themselves;
They are not his children,
Because of their blemish:
A perverse and crooked generation.
Do you thus deal with the Lord?
O foolish and unwise people?
Is he not your father, who bought you?
Has he not made you and established you?"
"Remember the days of old,
Consider the years of many generations.
Ask your father, and he will show you;
Your elders, and they will tell you:
When the most high divided their inheritance to the nations,
When he separated the sons of Adam,
He set the boundaries of the peoples
According to the number of the children of Israel
For the Lord's portion is his people;
Jacob is the place of his inheritance."
