The time for a great battle is coming.
Enough of these lies!
My nation cries to arise.
Sons of righteousness arise!
The world says to live immorally.
But we want to live like humans, not animals without understanding!
God, help us to arise and be a light in the darkness.
Lift up our country and heal our sickness.
