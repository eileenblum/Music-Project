[Isaiah 49:1-2]

"Listen, o coastlands, to me, and take heed you peoples from afar!
The Lord has called me from the womb;
From the matrix of my mother he has made mention of my name.
And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword;
In the shadow of his hand he has hidden me, and made me a polished shaft;
In his quiver he has hidden me."
