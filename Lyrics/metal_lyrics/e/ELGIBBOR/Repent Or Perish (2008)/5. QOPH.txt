[Psalm 119:145-152]

I cry out with my whole heart;
Hear me, O Lord!
I will keep your statutes.
I cry out to you;
Save me, and I will keep your testimonies.
I rise before the dawning of the morning,
And cry for help;
I hope in your word.
My eyes are awake through the night watches,
That I may meditate on your word.
Hear my voice according to your lovingkindness;
O Lord, revive me according to your justice.
They draw near who follow after wickedness;
Thy are far from the law.
You are near, O Lord,
and all your commandments are truth.
Concerning your testimonies,
I have known of old that you have founded them forever.
