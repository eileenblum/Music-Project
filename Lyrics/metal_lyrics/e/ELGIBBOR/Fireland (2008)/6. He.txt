Teach me, O Lord, to follow your decreesThen I will keep them to the end Give me understanding, and I will keep your lawAnd obey it with all my heart Direct me in the path of your commandsFor there I find delight Turn my heart toward your statutesAnd not toward selfish gain Turn my eyes away from worthless thingsPreserve my life according to your word Fulfill your promise to your servantSo that you may be feared Take away the disgrace I dreadFor your laws are good How I long for your precepts!Preserve my life in your righteousness
