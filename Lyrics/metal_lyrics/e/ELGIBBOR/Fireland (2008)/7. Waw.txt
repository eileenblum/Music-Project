May your unfailing love come to me, O LordYour salvation according to your promise Then I will answer the one who taunts meFor I trust in your word Do not snatch the word of truth from my mouthFor I have put my hope in your laws I will always obey your lawFor ever and ever I will walk about in freedomFor I have sought out your precepts I will speak of your statutes before kingsAnd will not be put to shame For I delight in your commandsBecause I love them I lift up my hands to your commands, which I loveAnd I meditate on your decrees
