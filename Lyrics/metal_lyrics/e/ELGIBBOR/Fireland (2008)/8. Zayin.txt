Remember your word to your servantFor you have given me hope My comfort in my suffering is thisYour promise preserves my life The arrogant mock me without restraintBut I do not turn from your law I remember your ancient laws, O LordAnd I find comfort in them Indignation grips me because of the wickedWho have forsaken your law Your decrees are the theme of my songWherever I lodge In the night I remember your name, O LordAnd I will keep your law This has been my practiceI obey your precepts
