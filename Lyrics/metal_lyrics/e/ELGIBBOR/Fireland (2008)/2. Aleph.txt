Blessed are they whose ways are blamelessWho walk according to the law of the Lord Blessed are they who keep his statutesAnd seek him with all their heart They do nothing wrongThey walk in his ways You have laid down preceptsThat are to be fully obeyed Oh, that my ways were steadfastIn obeying your decrees! Then I would not be put to shameWhen I consider all your commands I will praise you with an upright heartAs I learn your righteous laws I will obey your decreesDo not utterly forsake me
