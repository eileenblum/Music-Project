Do good to your servant, and I will liveI will obey your word Open my eyes that I may seeWonderful things in your law I am a stranger on earthDo not hide your commands from me My soul is consumed with longingFor your laws at all times You rebuke the arrogant, who are cursedAnd who stray from your commands Remove from me scorn and contemptFor I keep your statutes Though rulers sit together and slander meYour servant will meditate on your decrees Your statutes are my delightThey are my counselors
