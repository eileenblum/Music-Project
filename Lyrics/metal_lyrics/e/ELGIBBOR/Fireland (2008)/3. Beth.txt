How can a young man keep his way pure?By living according to your word I seek you with all my heartDo not let me stray from your commands I have hidden your word in my heartThat I might not sin against you Praise be to you, O LordTeach me your decrees With my lips I recountAll the laws that come from your mouth I rejoice in following your statutesAs one rejoices in great riches I meditate on your preceptsAnd consider your ways I delight in your decreesI will not neglect your word
