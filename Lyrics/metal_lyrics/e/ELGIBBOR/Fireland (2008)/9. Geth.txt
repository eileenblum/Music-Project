You are my portion, O LordI have promised to obey your words I have sought your face with all my heartBe gracious to me according to your promise I have considered my waysAnd have turned my steps to your statutes I will hasten and not delayTo obey your commands Though the wicked bind me with ropesI will not forget your law I am a friend to all who fear youTo all who follow your precepts The earth is filled with your love, O LordTeach me your decrees
