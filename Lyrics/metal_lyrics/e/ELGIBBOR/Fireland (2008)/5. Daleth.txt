I am laid low in the dustPreserve my life according to your word I recounted my ways and you answered meTeach me your decrees Let me understand the teaching of your preceptsThen I will meditate on your wonders My soul is weary with sorrowStrengthen me according to your word Keep me from deceitful waysBe gracious to me through your law I have chosen the way of truthI have set my heart on your laws I hold fast to your statutes, O LordDo not let me be put to shame I run in the path of your commandsFor you have set my heart free
