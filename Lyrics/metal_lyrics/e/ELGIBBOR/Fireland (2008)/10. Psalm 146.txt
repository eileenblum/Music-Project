Praise the LordPraise the Lord, O my soul I will praise the Lord all my lifeI will sing praise to my God as long as I live Do not put your trust in princesIn mortal men, who cannot save When their spirit departs, they return to the groundOn that very day their plans come to nothing Blessed is he whose help is the God of JacobWhose hope is in the Lord his God The Maker of heaven and earthThe sea, and everything in themThe Lord, who remains faithful forever He upholds the cause of the oppressedAnd gives food to the hungryThe Lord sets prisoners free The Lord gives sight to the blindThe Lord lifts up those who are bowed downThe Lord loves the righteous The Lord watches over the alienAnd sustains the fatherless and the widowBut he frustrates the ways of the wicked The Lord reigns foreverYour God, O Zion, for all generationsPraise the Lord
