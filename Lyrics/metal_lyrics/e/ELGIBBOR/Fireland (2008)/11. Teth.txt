Do good to your servantAccording to your word, O Lord Teach me knowledge and good judgmentFor I believe in your commands Before I was afflicted I went astrayBut now I obey your word You are good, and what you do is goodTeach me your decrees Though the arrogant have smeared me with liesI keep your precepts with all my heart Their hearts are callous and unfeelingBut I delight in your law It was good for me to be afflictedSo that I might learn your decrees The law from your mouth is more precious to meThan thousands of pieces of silver and gold
