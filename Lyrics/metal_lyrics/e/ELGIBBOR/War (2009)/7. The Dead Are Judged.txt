Then I saw a great white throneAnd him who was seated on it.Earth and sky fled from his presence,And there was no place for them.And I saw the dead, great and small,Standing before the throne, and books were opened.Another book was opened, which is the book of life.The dead were judged according to what theyHad done as recorded in the books.The sea gave up the dead that were in it,And death and Hades gave up the deadThat were in them,And each person was judged according to what he had done.Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.The lake of fire is the second death.If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life,He was thrown into the lake of fire.
