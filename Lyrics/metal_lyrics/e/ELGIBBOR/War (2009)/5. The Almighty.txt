At this my heart pointsAnd leaps from its place.Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice,To the rumbling that comes from his mouth.He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heavenAnd sends it to the ends of the earth.After that comes the sound of his roar;He thunders with his majestic voice.When his voice resounds,He holds nothing back.He loads the clouds with moisture;He scatters his lightning through them.At his direction they swirl aroundOver the face of the whole earthTo do whatever he commands them.He brings the clouds to punish men,Or to water his earth and show his love.Out of the north he comes in golden splendor;God comes in awesome majesty.The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power;In his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.Therefore, men revere him,For does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?
