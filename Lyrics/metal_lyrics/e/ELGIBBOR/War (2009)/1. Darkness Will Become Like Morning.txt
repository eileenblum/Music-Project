Are not my few days almost over?Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joyBefore I go to the place of no return,To the land of gloom and deep shadow,To the land of deepest night,Of deep shadow and disorder,Where even the light is like darkness.Yet if you devote your heart to him andStretch out your hands to him,If you put away the sin that is in your handAnd allow no evil to dwell in your tent,Then you will lift up your face without shame;You will stand firm and without fear.You will surely forget your trouble,Recalling it only as waters gone by.Life will be brighter than noonday,And darkness will become like morning.You will be secure, because there is hope;You will look about you and take your rest in safety.You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid,And many will court your favor.But the eyes of the wicked will fail,And escape will elude them;Their hope will become a dying gasp.
