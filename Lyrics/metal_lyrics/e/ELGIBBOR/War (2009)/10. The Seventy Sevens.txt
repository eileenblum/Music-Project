Seventy 'sevens' are decreed for your peopleAnd your holy city to finish transgression,To put an end to sin,To atone for wickedness,To bring in everlasting righteousness,To seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.Know and understand this:From the issuing of the decreeTo restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One,The ruler, comes, there will be seven 'sevens' and sixty-two 'sevens.'It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench,But in times of trouble.After the sixty-two 'sevens,'The Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing.The people of the ruler who will comeWill destroy the city and the sanctuary.The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end,And desolations have been decreed.He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.'In the middle of the 'seven' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.And on a wing of the temple he will set upAn abomination that causes desolation,Until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.
