I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign:Seven angels with the seven last plagues--Last, because with them God's wrath is completed.And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixedWith fire and, standing beside the sea;Those who had been victorious over the beastAnd his image and over the number of his name.They held harps given them by GodAnd sang the song of Moses the servant of GodAnd the song of the Lamb: "Great and marvelous are your deeds,Lord God Almighty.Just and true are your ways,King of the ages." Who will not fear you, O Lord,And bring glory to your name?For you alone are holy.All nations will come and worship before you,For your righteous acts have been revealed.After this I looked and in heaven the temple,That is, the tabernacle of the Testimony, was opened.Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues.
