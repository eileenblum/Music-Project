Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him:
"This is what the Sovereign Lord says:
You were the model of perfection,
Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
You were in Eden, the garden of God;
Every precious stone adorned you;
Ruby topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and jasper,
Sapphire, turquoise and beryl.
Your settings and mountings were made of gold;
On the day you were created they were prepared.
You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
For so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
You walked among the fiery stones."
