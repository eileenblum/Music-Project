I hate double-minded men,But I love your law.You are my refuge and my shield;I have put my hope in your word.Away from me, you evildoers,That I may keep the commands of my God!Sustain me according to your promise, and I will live;Do not let my hopes be dashed.Uphold me, and I will be delivered;I will always have regard for your decrees.You reject all who stray from your decrees,For their deceitfulness is in vain.All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross;Therefore I love your statutes.My flesh trembles in fear of you;I stand in awe of your laws.
