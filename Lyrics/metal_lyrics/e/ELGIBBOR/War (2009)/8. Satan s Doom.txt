When the thousand years are over,Satan will be released from his prisonAnd will go out to deceive the nationsIn the four corners of the earth--GogAnd Magog--to gather them for battle.In number they are like the sand on the seashore.They marched across the breadth of the earthAnd surrounded the camp of God's people,The city he loves.But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.And the devil, who deceived them,Was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur,Where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown.They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
