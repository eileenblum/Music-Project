[Music by: Lesniak, Stewart]

Beneath the earth, the dead awaken, no room in Hell, you are forsaken
House by the cemetery, deep within the mortuary, panic stricken humans flee
An act of pure futility

Thoughtless yet focused, disciplined and with purpose
A single minded undead army
They cannot be reasoned with, they cannot be bargained with
These blood-lusting cannibalistic cadavers
Their abnormal condition threatens us with extinction
You die and you become one of them
Addicted to splatter, only living flesh matters
Because only fresh blood can take the pain away

Closing in and moving fast, surrounded now we are the last, no longer do we dominate
Extermination is our fate, there is no escaping, they can smell our blood

Beneath the earth, the dead awaken, no room in Hell, you are forsaken
House by the cemetery, deep within the mortuary, panic stricken humans flee
An act of pure futility

Thoughtless yet focused, disciplined and with purpose
A single minded undead army
They cannot be reasoned with, they cannot be bargained with
These blood-lusting cannibalistic cadavers
Their abnormal condition threatens us with extinction
You die and you become one of them
Addicted to splatter, only living flesh matters
Because only fresh blood can take the pain away

Locked away inside a boarded up house, with windows tightly nailed shut
The tension sets in, you hear them moaning... scratching... beating... screaming!

The sound beyond the walls makes you go insane
The only word they speak sounds like brains... feeding... eating... devour... you

Bite the flesh to exhilarate the dead, open skull to reveal the grey matter
Rotting remains of the lifeless carcasses, in the name of death watch as they splatter
Festering maggots and gore galore, blood showers through the air and guts spray the floor
And all thatâs left for them now is a hunt just the same
They can smell our blood, they can smell our brains

Beneath the earth, the dead awaken, no room in Hell, you are forsaken
House by the cemetery, deep within the mortuary, panic stricken humans flee
An act of pure futility

Thoughtless yet focused, disciplined and with purpose
A single minded undead army
They cannot be reasoned with, they cannot be bargained with
These blood-lusting cannibalistic cadavers
Their abnormal condition threatens us with extinction
You die and you become one of them
Addicted to splatter, only living flesh matters
Because only fresh blood can take the pain away
