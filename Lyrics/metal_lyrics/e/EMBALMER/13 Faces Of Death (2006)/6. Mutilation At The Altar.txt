[Music by: Lesniak, Stewart]

Crawling while crippled, mutilation in store, sever more limbs, watch the blood pour
Bathe in the carnage, the sweet stench of death, constricting in bondage, consume your last breath
Slice up a symphony, a sonata in gore, egotistic epiphanies, salivating for more
Uncontrollable cravings for flesh and for bone, your soulâs not worth saving
Your tormentâs your own

Guts and blood, you worship death and desecrate the icon
Holy ones now lay dead
Masochist of mutilation
Demon lords I summon thee, unleash your evil power
Take the mark of the beast
Or be vanquished at the altar

Kneeling before me, submissive stance, no choice to live, not even a chance
Engorged with your pain, Hells fire burns, insanity reigns, to die itâs your turn
Buried still breathing, gasping for air, time lost believing, caught in his stare
Soul sent to Heaven, denied at the gate, you've wasted your time, only fools still have faith

Guts and blood, you worship death and desecrate the icon
Holy ones now lay dead
Masterpiece of mutilation
Demon lords I summon thee, unleash your evil power
Take the mark of the beast
Or be vanquished at the altar

Cultish signs left at the scene, butchery a religious need
Satanic killer stalks the night, but in the day he's out of sight
Motivated by disgust, death to God, an evil lust
Left to bleed, I hang you high, just like your Lord, you're crucified

Guts and blood, you worship death and desecrate the icon
Holy ones now lay dead
Masterpiece of mutilation
Lucifer I summon thee, unleash your evil power
Take the mark of the beast
Or be vanquished at the altar
