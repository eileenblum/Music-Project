[Music by: Fleming, Stewart]

Smell the stench of your own death
Skin falls off, thereâs nothing left
Demented doctor scalpel in hands
Removes the organs, removes the glands

Evil experiments, examinations of the dead
Hanging on the wall is your rotting fucking head
Tortured continuously before you die
Waiting for death on the table you lie... lie

Bleed all over me, to see you suffer is why I live
As I cut you open, organs fall from your ribs

With the razor sharp and nice, cut you wide with every slice
Bloodstream open, guts exposed, vital parts decomposed

Evil experiments, examinations of the dead
Hanging on the wall is your rotting fucking head
Tortured continuously before you die
Waiting for death on the table you lie... lie

Rotten body fluids spilled everywhere
Smell of fluid fills his lair
Rotten body fluids spilled everywhere
Smell of fluid fills his lair

Rotten body fluids spilled everywhere
Smell of fluid fills his lair
Rotten body fluids spilled everywhere
Smell of fluid fills his lair

Smell the stench of your own death
Skin falls off, thereâs nothing left
Demented doctor scalpel in hands
Removes the organs, removes the glands

Evil experiments, examinations of the dead
Hanging on the wall is your rotting fucking head
Tortured continuously before you die
Waiting for death on the table you lie... lie

Bleed all over me, to see you suffer is why I live
As I cut you open, organs fall from your ribs

Rotten body fluids spilled everywhere
Smell of fluid fills his lair
