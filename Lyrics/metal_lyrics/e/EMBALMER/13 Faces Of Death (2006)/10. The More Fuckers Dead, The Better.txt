[Music by: Wolff, Lesniak, Fleming, Stewart]

Murder everybody, I decided yesterday
The more fuckers dead, the better, a legion of decay
You worthless life forms to me, I hate more everyday

Slaughter them for ignorance, massacre of their existence
Hate crimes, death threats, fulfilled in the name of revenge
Vengeance upon those, you've always wanted to see dead
Their family to suffer and all of their friends

Leader of our country starts wars of bullshit lies
FUCK IT!!! It's a reason to kill them all, to see everybody die
Murder on our homeland or blood from other lands
It doesn't matter to me, it's humans I can't stand

Slaughter them for ignorance, massacre of their existence
Hate crimes, death threats, fulfilled in the name of revenge
Vengeance upon those, you've always wanted to see dead
Their family to suffer and all of their friends

The more fuckers dead, the better
The more fuckers dead, the better

Hate crimes, death threats, fulfilled in the name of revenge
Vengeance upon those, you've always wanted to see dead
Their family to suffer and all of their friends

Hate crimes, death threats, fulfilled in the name of revenge
Vengeance upon those, you've always wanted to see dead
Their family to suffer and all of their friends

The more fuckers dead, the better
