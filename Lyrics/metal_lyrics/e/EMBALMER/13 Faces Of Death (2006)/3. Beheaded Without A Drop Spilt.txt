[Music by: Wolff, Stewart]

You've become my greatest endeavor, die for me and last forever
Step number one in my incision of sickness, hold the iron behind the blade
Slice real slow you scream and suffer, not a drop spilt as I kill you

Across the spine I start to cut, the anticipation gets me eager
Almost there as your flesh burns and lets off rancid odors
You're still alive, my deed is done and thatâs what I had hoped for
Beheaded, head is gone, headless evermore

Beheaded without a drop spilt
Decapitate without a sense of guilt
Then hold the head up and laugh ungodly
As I show them their own body

Beheaded without a drop spilt, beheaded without a sense of guilt
Beheaded, Decapitate, Beheaded, Decapitate!!!

Beheaded without a drop spilt
Decapitate without a sense of guilt
Then hold the head up and laugh ungodly
As I show them their own body

You've become my greatest endeavor, die for me and last forever
