[Music by: Fleming, Wolff, Stewart]

Haunted by you, haunted by you
Have you had the pleasure yet
To dance with the devil, under pale moonlight?
Put yourself inside a pentagram of blood
Summon the Ouija, the possession has begun
The 13 ghosts have called your name
Awaken from your ancient slumber, dead you die insane
Unlucky spectre ahold of me
The voodoo curse on Friday the 13th

I canât escape this spell
They suck me down to Hell
I see that where I fell
Where life no longer dwells

Metal âtil Death

The killing spree that never ends
An abomination upon all man
The wounds of the Jew lord that never heal
An axe across the throat, I eternally kill
I'm the devil that the Christians had warned you about
I'm a slasher in the night in a London town
I'm a zombie in the fog just around the east
I'm a voodoo curse on Friday the 13th
