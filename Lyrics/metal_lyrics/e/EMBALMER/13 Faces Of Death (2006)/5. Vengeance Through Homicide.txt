[Music by: Lesniak, Wolff, Stewart]

I killed a whole entire fucking family just to watch them die
I slit the babies throat and gouged out your brothers eyeballs
I raped your god damn sister, helplessly you watched and prayed
I behead your cumstain mother, to kill another day

Rip you without care and watch you bleed
To scream, it does no good, with a slit throat gurgling
Split six ways of Sunday amputee
Cauterized wounds to be kept alive, prolong how long you suffer

I make you suck your fatherâs cock and stick my gun inside your cunt
When he nuts a load in you, I blow his fucking brains out
Pleading one last time to save your ass, but you know that youâre doomed
I rape you with a bandsaw and perform my final sex act

Rip you without care and watch you bleed
To scream it does no good, with a slit throat gurgling
Split six ways of Sunday amputee
Cauterized wounds to be kept alive, prolong how long you suffer

I pour the gasoline over your lifeless corpse and take some time to masturbate on you
Now I strike a match and set your house in flames and the fire it baptizes you
OKAY I'LL DO IT
As I walk through the ashes and the charred remains, I find your bones to disintegrate
Stomped to pieces within the ashen coals, now I want to destroy your soul

I kill myself and go to Hell and find your soul and attack again
Even more rapidly, sicker and perverse, in the name of evil ruthless
Barbarically I waste your spirit, so you donât exist even in Hell
I hated your life, I staged your death, you worthless bitch, you waste of breath

Rip you without care and watch you bleed
To scream it does no good, with a slit throat gurgling
Split six ways of Sunday amputee
Cauterized wounds to be kept alive, prolong how long you suffer
