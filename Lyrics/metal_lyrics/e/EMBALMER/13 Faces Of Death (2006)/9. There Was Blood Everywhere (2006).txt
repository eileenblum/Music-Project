[Music by: Fleming, Stewart]

Hidden within, my darkest sin
The dead can hear, my darkest fear
The murder remembered so plain in my head
Back from the grave
In my thoughts you are dead
The murder remembered so plain in my head
Back from the grave
I thought you were dead

I am the killer of killers
A fading memory
And my twisted mind surfaces
Into your reality

The whore was so beautiful after I ripped her apart
She was a nice girl and she had a good heart
All alone in a deck of cards, blackest diamonds bleeding hearts
I am Gemini for I am of two, within my sin I'm still killing you
