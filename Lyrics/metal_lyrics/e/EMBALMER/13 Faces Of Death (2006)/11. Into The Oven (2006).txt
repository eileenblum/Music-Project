[Music by: T. Wulff, Stewart]

Strapped on the table, prepared for gore
Must complete my ghoulish chore
Below the crypt, beneath the tomb
Cremation stench fills the room

Skin is seared, brains pulsate
Parts melt off, on the tray
Flesh burns, innards boil
Your turn is next, prepare the foil

Into the furnace
Into the oven

Cremationâs now complete
Remove the steaming sheet

Strapped on the table, prepared for gore
Must complete my ghoulish chore
Below the crypt, beneath the tomb
Cremation stench fills the room

Skin is seared, brains pulsate
Parts melt off, on the tray
Flesh burns, innards boil
Your turn is next, we're out of oil
