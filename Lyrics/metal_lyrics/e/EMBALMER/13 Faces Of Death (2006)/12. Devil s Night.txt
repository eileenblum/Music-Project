[Music by: Wolff, Stewart]

Darkness sets on the land, evil minds mend
Clashing together ideas of sick madness
Fire blazes the streets, flesh and flames meet
Breathing the Devils work, suffocate me

Samhain is the end of the summer, a ritual of all Hallows eve
There is an evil that's too hard to fight, bless us in blood
It's Devil's night

Innocent families burnt to ashes, scars and scrapes meet rips and gashes
Still have a hard-on from my urge to kill, a burnt down city is the Devil's will
When only ash remains I'm satisfied, I can only laugh at those who die
You can smell the dead flesh in the air, I've killed so many, I donât care

Darkness sets on the land, evil minds mend
Clashing together ideas of sick madness
Fire blazes the streets, flames and flesh meet
Breathing the Devil's work, suffocate me

Samhain is the end of the summer, a ritual of all hallows eve
There is an evil that's too hard to fight, bless us in blood
It's Devil's night

Morning, just pieces remain, the death tollâs insane
The smoke is still rising, the flesh is still burning
The image, the face of the beast, stares down on the streets
Laughing at man as they suffer his torment

On Halloween eve
On Halloween night
