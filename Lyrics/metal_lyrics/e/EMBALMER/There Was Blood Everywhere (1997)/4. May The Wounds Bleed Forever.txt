Amputated anatomy skeletal remains, breaking off the bones, dissecting of the brain
Shredding with a bullet entering your skull, body opens up, corpses start to fall
Human jigsaw bleeding find the missing link, open with my shot, brains splatter pink
As you bleed I take off this, take off that, pieces and  your parts
Chop off this, and chop off that, amputate the heart
Bloody killing always sick from the fucking start
She watches as I move slowly, sick stare as I cut her cunt wide
She screams as she bleeds my knife cuts in her foul stench fills the air
The deeper the wounds the harder they are to heal
Cutting into your veins stopping the blood flow decapitate the head
Make the pain go slow lobotomized tranquilized drilling for the brains
Scattered dissected bloody offerings, a basic face removal lesson for the day
Killing every way decapitate and slay
Chop off this gouge out that, eyes lashing out of sockets
Rip off this split open that put into meat pockets
Knivings stabbings and human crucifixions
We who are slime like maggots, who crawl through this corpse of an earth
Back out on the streets stalking you again
Through you have escaped me, you'll always bleed within
