Legs spread flesh torn, still gagging on the stench of chloroform
Lidless eyes shards of glass as I mutilate you pray for the pain to pass

Endless pain, I'm insane, bound and gagged
Endless pain, torturing my victims I'm insane

As I tighten your restraints you cry in pain
I steal your breath you pray for death

Hot knife peels flesh
When I'm through I'll smoke a joint
Then I'll take a rest, slit throat too late
Smiles with a fiendish grin as I decapitate

I'm fucking insane
