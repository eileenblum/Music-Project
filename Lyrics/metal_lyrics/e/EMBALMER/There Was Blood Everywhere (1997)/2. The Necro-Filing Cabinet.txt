Resurrect the files of the dead effigy
The time to rot is near
Looking back into lives we discover
We've been doomed for awhile
Dismembered visions yet to come
We are the rotting ones

I want all to die and rot in pain
Drawing near is judgment day
Burning skin children's screams

I love pain and suffering

Laughing back at life's files
We spit in the face of the prophet
He speaks to us we say is lies but in the end
He laughs as we cry

[Chorus]

Killed so many before they could reach me
Then I spilled your blood before you could flee

[Chorus]
