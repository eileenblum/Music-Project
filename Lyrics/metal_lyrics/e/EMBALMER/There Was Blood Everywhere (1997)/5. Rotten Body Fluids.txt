Smell the stench of your own death
Your skin falls off
There's nothing left
Demented Doctor
Scalpel in hands
Removes the organs, removes the glands

Evil experiments, examinations of the dead
Hanging on the wall is your rotting fucking head
Tortured continuously before you die
Waiting for death on the table you lie

Bleed all over me, to see you suffer is why I live
As I cut you open organs fall from your ribs
With the razor sharp and nice
Cut you wide with every slice (Repeat three times)

Rotten body fluids spilled everywhere
Smell of fluids fills his lair (Repeat two times)
