Invoke me now
From my tomb
Through the cellar
Seal your doom
Release my chains
Bound with pain
Draw you down
To my domain

Unleashed evil
From the cellar
Disembowel you
Eat your entrails
Hold you down
Abacinate you
Rip your throat out
Watch you die

Necronomicon holds the demons power
Now release what lives inside the cellar

Embalmer is; 
John Jermann - Lead Guitars
Dave Phillips - Bass
Roy Stewart - Drums
Mark Davis - Lead Guitar
Rick Fleming - Vocals &amp; Lyrics
