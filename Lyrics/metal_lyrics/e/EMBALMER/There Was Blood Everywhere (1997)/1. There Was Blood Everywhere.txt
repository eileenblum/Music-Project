Hidden within my darkest sin the dead can hear my darkest fear
The murder remembered so plain in my head
Back from the grave in my thoughts you are dead
The murder remembered so plain in my head
Back from the grave in my thoughts you are dead
I am the killer of killers a fading memory
And my twisted mind surfaces into your reality
The whore was so beautiful after I ripped her apart
She was a nice girl and had a good heart
All alone in a deck of cards blackest diamonds bleeding hearts
I am Gemini for I am two within my sin. I'm still killing you
