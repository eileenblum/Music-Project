a world in decay
where no one and nothing belongs
guided by dogmas and prophets of lies
everyone has got his part in this system of fools
oh some of us don't know what's going on

who would betray
who doesn't see the winds over peculiar faces
crossing the fields with scars of the past
but what real future is teach the seconds and days
some of us walk the false way and believe what they say

a world in an abstract dress
that's spun by a material consciousness
where are the ideals which god created
they're weak and fall in the deep
where the damned souls creep
some of us don't know what's going on

life is a game of chess
we're just the figures in the hands of a growing disease
we've grown blind
our eyes are scarred by the flames of the burning lands
some of us walk the false way and believe what they say

world in decay
world in decay
world in decay
world in decay

who would betray
who doesn't see the winds over peculiar faces
crossing the fields with the scars of the past
but what real future is teach the seconds and days

[solo: Dan]

we've grown blind
