human race is history now
destoyed by themselves
unable for more
timely before we seize more space
good luck for the universe
we leave you alone

I kneel down for my last orison
thanks for all that I got in my life
now it's time to say goodbye to mother earth
thanks for all that I got after birth

the end of time has been reached now
the end of time has been reached now
take the message of the gods: come with us

our blue planet sinks in ashes
deformed and wasted
no generation can heal the wounds
corruption has won
but who is the winner

I kneel down for my last orison
thanks for all that I got in my life
now it's time to say goodbye to mother eatrth

the end of time has been reached now
the end of time has been reached now
the end of time has been reached now
take the message of the gods: come with us
