awakening is meaningless now
just loneliness
a slave of self-deception
in the suction of destruction

please let me die
please let me die
please let me die
please let me die
please let me die on this day
I see mutated bodies in the sector
trapped and controlled
no reason fo existence
watch the signs of the forthcoming epoch
signs which means repirsal

it's time to give up
it's time to give up
enjoy your execution

[solo: Uwe]

it's time to give up
it's time to give up
it's time to give up
enjoy your execution

a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity
a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity

[solo: Uwe]

a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity
a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity

the chains of hegemony are torn
the wings of the angels are broken
they're falling from the sky
lacerated by the hungry one
it's just a scene of insanity
on the front court of insanity
a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity

a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity
a new day's absurdity
on the front court of eternity
