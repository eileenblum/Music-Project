[solo: Dan]
silence in the desert of forgotten civilizations
the ground is stained with blood
the only testimony of the past
memories you've got melt away in the sand
no hope just the expanse of nothingness
hear!
there's someone in the silence
their screams are at the end of the horizon
damned, they do penance fo the history
in the prisons of posterity

one day they will march under red skies
nomads on the hunt for the promised paradise
when the walls are wounded from internal pain
the instincts will be stronger than a morbid brain
and there's feelings inside 
but there's life outside

hear!
there's someone in the silence
their screams are at the end of the horizon
damned, they do penance for the history
in the prisons of posterity

[solo: Uwe]

hear!
there's someone in the silence
their screams are at the end of the horizon
damned, they do penance fo the history
in the prisons of posterity
