lost in a labyrinth
of growing hatred and cold winds
cabaret on wasted places
theatre with human faces
consumed by my own thoughts
bowing to almighty gods
a torment for the living body
please please please redeem me

walls of sadness seas of tears
filled by rivers of human fears
like needles on every nerve
I'm waiting for my rebirth

eternal lights shall rise
to show the way I have to go
sleepless nights and restless days
all I loved a fucked up haze
insensible ready for exit
to leave behind this growing shit
a torment for the living body
please please please redeem me

walls of sadness seas of tears
filled by rivers of human fears
like needles on every nerve
I'm waiting for my rebirth

[solo: Uwe]

lost in a labyrinth
of growing hatred and cold winds
cabaret on wasted places
theatre with human faces
consumed by my own thoughts
bowing to almighty gods
a torment for the living body
please please please redeem me

walls of sadness seas of tears
filled by rivers of human fears
like needles on every nerve
I'm waiting for my rebirth
