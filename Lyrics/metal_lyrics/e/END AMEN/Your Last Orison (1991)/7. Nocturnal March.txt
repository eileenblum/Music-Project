nocturnal fright of the survivors
their opinions all over the earth
you can hear the awful murmur
disturbed only by their cries
some of them believe in groups
and choose who will be their leader
primitive objects in an over-civilised world
they start to fight for their lives
in legions of hate they march

please stay away from me
leave me alone with your same mistakes
my long wished freedom I can see
and I'm waiting till earth shakes

squalid areas everywhere in sight
all inhabitants are predetermined
a second arc or a natural process
who comprehends get heaviness
awful and grey, dust and decay
the sunlight doesn't find it's way
burials in holy ruins
when the storm of the legions is over

please stay away from me
leave me alone with your same mistakes
my long wished freedom I can see
and I'm waiting till earth shakes

[solo: Uwe]

please stay away from me
leave me alone with your same mistakes
my long wished freedom I can see
and I'm waiting till earth shakes
