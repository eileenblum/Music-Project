Mysts dance upon a fading sunset
Damnation sings my name
The war is lost as my fate
Tears and blood on this rotten soil
Silence at absence unknown universe
My name burns in eternal flames as
Begotten oblivion I own
Letting me ride thousand frozen lights
Searching for you
In vain
You, lost and guilty prostitute for my senses
That ran away from me
Through infinite scratching bleeding thorns
My mind vacillates in this labyrinth
Of fragile equilibrium called existence
And tries to fly away searching for
the purest sky where to yield to divine
