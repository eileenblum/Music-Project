I see flames of time devouring everything I know
They play to hide through the centuries of doom
They rise encircling the fury of kings as
I engrave dark horizons of purity
Sinful obscurity
Existence - essence of solitude
Truth - chain of thoughts
A rise to the immaculate gates of infinity
Where I will lie with divine spoils
