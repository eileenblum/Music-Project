Along forgotten shadows of blood
In the dark endless
Remembering the night that hidden us
We have wandered silent through centuries
Sons denied of a sleeping father
We have lived hidden life from you
Scared eyes
Silence embraced us
Pregate a voi figli di un monda bastarda
I vostri simboli non vi salveranno
We are too far
Beyond your ruins
Beyond our triumph
