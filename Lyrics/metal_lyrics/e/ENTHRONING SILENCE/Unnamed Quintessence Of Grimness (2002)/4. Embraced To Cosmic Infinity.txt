Let me hear the echoes of my years
Let me ride through the winds of fate
I will cry for the fatal dawn
For your frozen sÃ©ance
I will dream of bleeding flames
Swimming in the void
Let me dream of my enemies defeated
Embraced to cosmic infinity
This struggle I long for
It burns me
It devours me
Embraced to silent infinity
