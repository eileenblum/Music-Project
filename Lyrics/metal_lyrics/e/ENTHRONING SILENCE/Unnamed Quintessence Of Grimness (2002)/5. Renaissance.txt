Silence it shall be
Magic sound of fimbulwinter
And this frozen ash
Shall be our way
Blind in the flames of destiny
I shall open my eyes
Confessing you among thousand faces
And then fire shall live in
Autumnal mysts
Sacrifice
Conquering the night
That has been ours
Open your wings
To my horizons
To tame my whispers
