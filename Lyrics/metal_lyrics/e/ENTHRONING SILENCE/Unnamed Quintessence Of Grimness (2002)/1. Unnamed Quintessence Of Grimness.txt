Drowned in dusk touching universe
An useless pray to entrap an aeon
You know we die?
You know the blood stopped its way?
In the fire all intentions are burning
Lights are riding from this useless world
Leaving oblivion behind
Sufferance I know you
You are the mother of my desires
Hate I bless you
You are the father of my rebirth
I am the bastard son of this world
Unnamed quintessence of grimness
I am the virtue of humanity
