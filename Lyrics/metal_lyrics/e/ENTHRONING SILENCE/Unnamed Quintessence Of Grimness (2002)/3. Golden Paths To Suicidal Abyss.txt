Life seems so far from here
Bleeding in the dust with fear
Frost essence embraces the smell of thy words
As I fall in desecration
Vortex devours certain in this march to abyss
Delirium path to pain
Hallucinating senses
I without soul as blood frozen on rotten soil
Tonight my thoughts are flesh touched by the unknown
Pureness rotten in perfection
