Up to the front screaming with rage
Fists to the air face to the stage
Front row's the dead zone the peak of your fears
Slammin' of bodies blood in the ears

Smashin'em down, down to the ground
Smashin'em down, pound after pound
Smashin'em down, down to the ground
Smashin'em down

Breakneck pace, whipping's the dance
Trashing the place blood on the hands
Delirious fury strike as to smash
Here in the pit we batter your ass

Smashin'em down, down to the ground
Smashin'em down, pound after pound
Smashin'em down, down to the ground
Smashin'em down

Kill after kill after kill after kill

Rattling skulls rapid succession
The line of battle, mass domination
Front row's the place to let it go
Decibel fire, a punishing show

Smashin'em down, down to the ground
Smashin'em down, pound after pound
Smashin'em down, down to the ground
Smashin'em down
Down
