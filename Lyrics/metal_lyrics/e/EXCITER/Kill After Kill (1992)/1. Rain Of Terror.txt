Something is blowing in the wind
A chill rips up your spine
Stops you dead right in your tracks
You're running out of time

You know there's nothing you can do
Drop right to your knees
Satan's wrath from the skies
Inflicting disease

Rain, rain., rain, rain of terror
Rain, rain., rain, rain of terror

Enough to burn your eyes out
Death runs through the air
You know your life is over
Acid everywhere

Death from above created below
No one takes the blame
In through the lungs straight to the mind
Damaging my brain

Rain, rain., rain, rain of terror
Rain, rain., rain, rain of terror

Blackest anger from the skies
Coming down on you and I
Killing life blood, melting Earth
No more chances for her rebirth

Something is blowing in the wind
A chill rips up your spine
Stops you dead right in your tracks
You're running out of time

You know there's nothing you can do
Drop right to your knees
Satan's wrath from the skies
Inflicting disease

Rain, rain., rain, rain of terror
Rain, rain., rain, rain of terror
