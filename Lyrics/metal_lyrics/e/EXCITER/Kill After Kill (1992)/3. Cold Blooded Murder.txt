Black heart red eyes of a killer
No conscience no regret
Assassination hunger
One blast you're put to death
Lost child no attention getter
All his life he's had to fight
At the cost of an innocent victim
Now mother pays the price

Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder

Cold blade or lead in the head
Point blank he don't care
No life no place to go
Just knowing no one cares
A shot in the dark or right on the mark
Homicide not suicide
Cold blooded takes pleasure to watch you to die

Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder

Black heart red eyes of a killer
No conscience no regret
Assassination hunger
One blast you're put to death
Lost child no attention getter
All his life he's had to fight
At the cost of an innocent victim
Now mother pays the price

Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder, cold blooded murder
