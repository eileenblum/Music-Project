Making a mark carved out of steel
For all of the world to see
To fade into black without any cause
Is not the way it should be
All of my life I have needed to be in the light
Never to die but not to go on with no life
No future!

Dying ain't much, much of a life
When no one remembers or cares
Scratched from a list erased from time
No one would know you were there

Stand up and fight for the right
To be known in this life
Never say die, never go on with no life
No future!

No life, no life, no life, no future
No life, no life, no life, no future
No fucking future
