Out on the wings of terror
Tonight I'm goin' back
Feel the need for danger
Back to the first attack

Through the years time is running out
Armageddon is coming now

Back on the road to destruction
Conquering all obstructions
Up to the front I am running
Wake the dead, the second coming

Darkest beast of thunder
I've come to kill again
Greet the terror master
Born to never end

In the black I have faded, how
From the dead I've awakened now

Back on the road to destruction
Conquering all obstructions
Up to the front I am running
Wake the dead, the second coming

Opened eyes, now I rise to victimize
Like I've done before
Terrorize, see my eyes
You're surprised as I break down your door

Out on the wings of terror
Tonight I'm goin' back
Feel the need for danger
Back to the first attack

Through the years time is running out
Armageddon is coming now

Back on the road to destruction
Conquering all obstructions
Up to the front I am running
Wake the dead, the second coming
