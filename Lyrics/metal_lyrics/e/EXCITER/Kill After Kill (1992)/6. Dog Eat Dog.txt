You have the right to remain silent
But who the hell wants to
Anything you say will be used
Only to degrade you

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog, dog eat dog

Stripped of all your dignity
Who the fuck cares
Misleading future you must be told
No one even dares

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog, dog eat dog

Welcome to the music biz
Always take never give
This is where the leaches live
Lose your life to make it big

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog, dog eat dog

Pencil pusher cocaine breath
Too damn fat for your own big desk
You'd be nowhere without me
It's dog eat dog nothing's free, no

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog, dog eat dog
