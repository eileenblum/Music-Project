Trapped inside this prison cell
You make life a living hell
I've always gave for you
I can't believe what you put me through

Violent destruction comes over you
Thoughts of suicide it's nothing new

I watch you wreck the place
Angel's heart Satan's face
Excuses running thin
I've got to leave this hell I'm in

Black rage of anger, smashing walls
I think you'd shoot yourself if you had the balls

Nothing learned, nothing taught
Nothing found, nothing sought
What is this you put me through
Cannot choose to be with you

Inside's just an empty head
Matter's dead no cells are fed
Is this the life you want to show
Well it's not what I want to know

Your violent tendencies
Have driven me away from you
If I stayed I know I would have shot ya dead
Yes someone should shoot ya down

Violent destruction comes over you
Thoughts of suicide it's nothing new

Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
Anger, anger
Hate and destruction, hate and destruction
