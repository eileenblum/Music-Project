Don't try to run
I've got you in my claws
Grip of death
You're trapped in my neck breaking jaws

Tied up in chains
The coldness of steel
Lightning quick
You're shocked frozen with fear

Kill for the feast
Nothing gets away from me
Kill for the feast
I'm the one I am the beast

You're breaking your neck
To turn to see
You love to stare
Then look straight at me

My eyes burn holes
In your spineless frame
I am the beast
No one will ever tame

Kill for the feast
Nothing gets away from me
Kill for the feast
I'm the one I am the beast

Biting, bleeding, screaming
But no one will hear your cries
Grinding, blinding, finding my claws
Stuck in your eyes

At night time
I strike while you sleep
I am the beast

Don't try to run
I've got you in my claws
Grip of death
You're trapped in my neck breaking jaws

Tied up in chains
The coldness of steel
Lightning quick
You're shocked frozen with fear

Kill for the feast
Nothing gets away from me
Kill for the feast
I'm the one I am the beast
I am the beast, I am the beast
I am the beast, I am the beast
I am the beast, I am the beast
I am the beast, beast, beast, beast, beast
