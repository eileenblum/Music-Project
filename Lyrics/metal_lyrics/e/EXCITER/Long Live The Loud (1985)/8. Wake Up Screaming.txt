When the day turns to night
I'm sweating with fright
As the sleeps closes in
My convulsions begin

My brain it feeds
On the terrors I've seen
Like a force in my head
It wants me dead

My God it knows what I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming

I'm lost in the black
My nightmares attack
The thing that I fear
Is knowing he's near

The force in my brain
Puts pressure again
I dream of the spell
That cursed me to hell

My God it knows what I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming

Take a look down
It's waiting there
Everywhere I turn
It's waiting to burn my soul

As the light turns to dark
I'm falling apart
These nightmares I've had
Are driving me mad

The final time
It enters my mind
It cries for revenge
I know it's the end

My God it knows what I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming
There's no where left to run
The fading of the sun
There's no returning back
From the dreams that I now have
Voices of demons
Shouting out with laughter
Now I'm screaming in pain
My heart is pounding faster

I'm crying out with fear
Satan laughs he's nearer
Is it now my time
Has he possessed my mind?
Has he come to live in me
To crucify and bury me?
He knows the terror I'm feeling
Then I wake up screaming
