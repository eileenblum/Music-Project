A faceless man steps up to meet you
Evil demons chanting "we want you"
A creation where time and death collide
You're feeling drawn to the other side

He's calling your name tonight
Ascend from the depths of your tomb
Looking back at the over world
From beyond the gates of doom

You've broken all ties that keep you alive
Is there life after death? That's for him to decide
Beyond these gates you obey or you burn
Either way you will never return

He's calling your name tonight
Ascend from the depths of your tomb
Looking back at the over world
From beyond the gates of doom

Did you see, do you care?
There is life over there
But you must die to get inside
You're grasping, reaching but no one can feel
Looks like you're on the other side

Beyond, beyond, beyond the gates of doom
Beyond, beyond, beyond the gates of doom
Beyond, beyond, beyond the gates of doom
Beyond the gates of doom
Beyond
