On the day you were born
He marked your soul with evil
Out on the streets
You were growing spreading fear
Under your hair three sixes appear
You were sent to do his task
But your death grows nearer and nearer
You know your life is fading fast

You are born to die
You are born to die
You are born to die
You are, you are born to die

The youth flock to your side
But your mission you must hide
If you live your life
You will rule empires with fire
You will hold unearthly power
To conquer all in sight
But when they find you
They will destroy you
The final fight

You are born to die
You are born to die
You are born to die
You are, you are born to die

You're living evil tonight
Terrorizing all in sight
You make the banshee cry
'Cause you were born to die

Before you know it
They're coming to get you
Time it takes it's toll on you
Marked by the devil living his power
Armageddon was always true
You'll meet the ruler face to face
To be slain by the knives of God
Your blood will flow through the caverns of Earth
Back to hell your soul will go

On the day you die
You'll demand death to all
Three days of darkness
And the world cracks and faults
Under the cross your shadow appears
With the knives shoved deep as you burn
Thunder cracks the sky
As you scream from hell "I shall return"

You are born to die
You are born to die
You are born to die
You are, you are born to die
Born to die
