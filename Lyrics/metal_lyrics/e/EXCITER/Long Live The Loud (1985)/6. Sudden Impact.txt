Battles of death are upon us
Burning at a constant pace
Destruction of time is awaited
The end of a civilized place

Can mankind afford this?
The heat and the suffering minds
Equipped for sudden impact
But never for one of this kind

Heat burns to kill
The night is black and still
Look to the sky
Don't ask why

Nations must wait in fear
The ending of time is so near
Your future and your destination
As shot the battles are here

Can the masters rebuild it?
The blackened waste left behind
Equipped for sudden impact
But never for one of this kind

Heat burns to kill
The night is black and still
Look to the sky
Don't ask why

Can mankind afford this?
The heat and the suffering minds
Equipped for sudden impact
But never for one of this kind

Crushing of Earth, Satan's rebirth
Burning all us to the ground

As I climb from the depths of my shelter
I look with a feeling of hate
This world has turned to a wasteland
Nothing left to replace

Man has made and destroyed it
The ending of life and time
Crushed by sudden impact
The omen, the final sign

Heat burns to kill
The night is black and still
Look to the sky
Don't ask why
Sudden impact, sudden impact
Sudden impact, sudden impact
