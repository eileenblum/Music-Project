On this night the ritual begins
Unholy terror deadly sin
The witching hour is growing near
The stroke of midnight the strike of fear

With sacred knife held tight in your hand
The maiden lies beneath where you stand
Mystic chants command you this night
She's a victim of sacrifice

Witches burn in hell
Dead men don't live to tell
Of torture and evil rights
They're victims of sacrifice

We are the victims burned at the stake
All of the innocent died in your place
Black magic rules the deep within your heart
I'll take your soul and I'll tear it apart

Crosses mark the space
Where terror took its place
Witches rule the night
When evil takes its bite

You're the sinner you're the fool
You have the power to break the rules
Your day is coming you wait and see
You'll burn in fire like the others and me

Walk into the circle candles at your feet
Resurrected now submission is weak
I'll raise the dead who's blood you'll drink
You know it's too late now later than you think

The nearer you get to hell
Witches cast their spells
The chosen pay the price
Like victims of sacrifice
