A cross is held with rage and fury
Silence betrayal by masters of war
Escape the realms of marching rulers
Be strong and brave a time of reason
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning yeah
A storm of violence awaits to strike
Merchants are calling to return the fight
Remember each dagger is held in mourning
But wait stand tall and face the call
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning yeah
A cross is held with rage and fury
Silence betrayal by masters of war
Escape the realms of marching rulers
Be strong and brave a time of reason
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning brutal warning
Brutal warning yeah
