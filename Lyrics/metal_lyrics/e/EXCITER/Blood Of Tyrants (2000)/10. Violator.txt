Forbidden on the eve of the holocaust
Imprisoned by the mentor of death
Held hostage by the slayer of innocence
Beyond darkness thereÂ´s nothing but
Destruction destruction destruction destruction
Stories of treason punish the dead
Bone crushing violators conquer the world
Fire breathing murderers agree
Death to the fallen rest in peace
Wicked slashers hunt for the weak
Bury the ones that are chosen slavery
Infernal grinders are diabolical fiends
Intense fighting crucifying all
Violator violator violator violator
Stories of treason punish the dead
Bone crushing violators conquer the world
Fire breathing murderers agree
Death to the fallen rest in peace
Violator violator violator violator
