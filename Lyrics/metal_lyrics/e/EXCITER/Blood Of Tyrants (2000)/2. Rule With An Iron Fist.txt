Die for the master
We are the keepers of the faith
Die for the master
We are the chosen ones
Eh oh eh eh oh oh
Eh oh eh eh oh oh
Rule with an iron fist
Fist fist fist fist fist
Nightmares invade the tower
In the army of the night
Deadly assault and combat
Fuels outrage and resistance
Eh oh eh eh oh oh
Eh oh eh eh oh oh
Rule with an iron fist
Fist fist fist fist fist
Screams race through silence
Refuse to live in possession
Die for the master
We are the keepers of the faith
Eh oh eh eh oh oh
Eh oh eh eh oh oh
Rule with an iron fist
Fist fist fist fist fist
