Rise up the end is near itÂ´s fast and loud
Shout it never say die and come out alive
Cry out the sonic thunder of crushing iron
Scream out legions of strength stand up and shout
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
Violence the streets are dark right to the end
Rip off your face forget the war of anger and hate
Dying relent the race and surrender you will
Pounding the hammer falls on disciples of hell
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The strong annihilates
The strong annihilates
The strong annihilates
The strong annihilates metal crusader
Rise up the end is near itÂ´s fast and loud
Shout it never say die and come out alive
Cry out the sonic thunder of crushing iron
Scream out legions of strength stand up and shout
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The force of the molten mask
Fears the charge of metal crusaders
The strong annihilates kill kill kill kill
The strong annihilates
The strong annihilates
The strong annihilates kill kill kill
