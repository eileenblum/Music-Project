The raging worlds collide
By tyrants doomed to die
Break down and slay the beast
Sheer terror from evil deeds
Regain control
Before you go insane
Destined to search
The graves of even more
Triumph deathÂ´s door
Remove the lock of war
Evoke the threat
Of soldiersÂ´ razorÂ´s edge
Predator predator
Predator predator
Stranded by violation
Though treasonÂ´s destination
Reeking havoc of a killer
Oppression and vengeance
The chase begins to live
Terrorize terminate
Refuse your soul to hell
Bonded by power
Civilize the predatorÂ´s rage
Run and hide from the grip
The maniac will rip your face
Predator predator
Predator predator
The raging worlds collide
By tyrants doomed to die
Break down and slay the beast
Sheer terror from evil deeds
Regain control
Before you go insane
Destined to search
The graves of even more
Triumph deathÂ´s door
Remove the lock of war
Evoke the threat
Of soldiersÂ´ razorÂ´s edge
Predator predator
