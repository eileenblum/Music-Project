In the grave of victimsÂ´ past
Lies evil sacred ground
The wrath of doom resists the right
To sacrifice innocent blood blood yeah
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Disturb the dead for vengeance reigns
Immortal rage awaits to massacre
Slay the beast the tyrantÂ´s call
To kill the shadows of war
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
In the grave of victimsÂ´ past
Lies evil sacred ground
The wrath of doom resists the right
To sacrifice innocent blood blood
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
Give me blood give me blood
Give me blood give me blood of tyrants
