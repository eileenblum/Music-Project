Living in fear in the ditches at the front
Fighting for my life never knowing what's to come
Shell shock, heart attack eats me to the bone
Through the darkest Hell this battle rages on &amp; on
Enemy attack walls of fire burn the sky
Fighting with the rats of war, preparing to die

Violence &amp; Force
Taken by Violence &amp; Force
Violence &amp; Force
Taken by Violence &amp; Force

Armed with the weapons the power and the might
Opening fire defacing all in sight
Nuclear disaster forget about the war
A touch of switch no man will exist no more
Enemy attack walls of fire burn the sky
Fighting with the rats of war, preparing to die

Violence &amp; Force
Taken by Violence &amp; Force
Violence &amp; Force
Taken by Violence &amp; Force

Life on the stage is like the bloody crypts of war
Mind ripping metal shouting out for more
Fire bombs &amp; smoke white beamsfrom the lights
The scene of a battle burning in the night
Leave behind the weak we must take the strong in hand
Together are the wicked violent forces in command

Violence &amp; Force
Taken by Violence &amp; Force
Violence &amp; Force
Taken by Violence &amp;
Force!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
