It was the dawn of a new day smoke rings filled the air
Some kind of warning, allies in despair
The enemy's coming with their backs to the sun
Psych yourselves out &amp; load your guns

The devil is ringin' the death bells
The killer is screamin' the victims yells

War is Hell
War is Hell

It was the first attack the dead were left behind
The captain was calling, the sargent's eyes were blind
We're on our own now but can we survive?
Our only solution was to take our lives

The devil is ringin' the death bells
The killer is screamin' the victims yells

War is Hell

The devil is ringin' the death bells
The killer is screamin' the victims yells

War is Hell
War is Hell

It was the dawn of a new day smoke rings filled the air
Some kind of warning, allies in despair
The enemy's coming with their backs to the sun
Psych yourselves out &amp; load your guns

The devil is ringin' the death bells
The killer is screamin' the victims yells

War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
War is Hell
