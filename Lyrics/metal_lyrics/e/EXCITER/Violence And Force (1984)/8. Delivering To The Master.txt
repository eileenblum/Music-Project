In the shadows I will be lurking, waiting for my time to come
Noone messes with the dealer, I could burn for what I've done
In the night I will be watching, waiting for the man to show
Blood is boiling in my brains, you never know of tomorrow

Noone knows how far to go
Delivering to the Master
Don't sweat it the man's gotta show
Delivering to the Master

In the night the sweltering sweat running down the back of my head
Looking out for the man in black, One wrong move &amp; I'm dead
The master calls I start to shake, burning inside with fear
No escape, no way out, my destination will soon be here

Noone knows how far to go
Delivering to the Master
Don't sweat it the man's gotta show
Delivering to the Master

The moon has cast it's final glow, the sight of fogs in teh streets
White lines on a table of black, the only way I can ever find peace
Hiding out paranoia sets in, evil runs through my veins
Suicide, the last resort wake up I'm going insane

Noone knows how far to go
Delivering to the Master
Don't sweat it the man's gotta show
Delivering to the Master

I'm looking out for someone who could destroy my mind
I'm creeping 'round the corner biding my time
Waiting fo rthe set-up time, waiting for the attack
The heat is on the dealer, you're never comin' back
