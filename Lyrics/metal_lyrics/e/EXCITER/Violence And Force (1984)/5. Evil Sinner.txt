As I look into a dark &amp; lonely night
I look across a cloud of people dead
The sky is black &amp; gives off little light
&amp; I'm watching as her hands attack your head
She'll come, Tonight
To burn the sky!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A giant hand comes down to grip the dead
Can't believe my eyes of what I see
Screams of the sinner pierce my head
In fire &amp; intense heat &amp; hate
She'll come, Tonight
To burn the sky

Evil Sinner, Evil Sinner

She'll come, Tonight
To burn the sky!!!!!!!!!!!

The barren lands of waste are left behind
Evil Sinner rules her kingdom there
The holocaust has left one man untried
He's summoned by the Sinner's deadly stare, beware
She'll come, Tonight
To burn the sky

Evil Sinner, Evil Sinner
Evil Sinner, Evil Sinner
Evil... Sinner...
