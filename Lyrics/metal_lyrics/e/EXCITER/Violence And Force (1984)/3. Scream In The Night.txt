How can you escape them when they're hiding in the dark
The watcher waits in solitude to tear your mind apart
Deep within your soul they attack you in your dreams
Lost in another time you can't see where you've been
Nightfall arrives you bang your head against the wall
Demons inside your head won't let you sleep at all
Screaming for mercy &amp; there's no a soul around
Scream until the morning when they bring you to the ground

Injecting their poison at will
Moving right in for the kill
You'll have to fight for your lives
When you hear the Screm in the Night

Ah...haha

Dreams turn to nightmares &amp; you wish you were dead
With a terror strickenmind you tear the flesh from your head
Savage eyes seek vengeance in the shadows of teh night
Evil angels death disciples writhe with their delight
Full moon is glowin' &amp; you turn toward the sky
Eternal saints are calling, you seem to burn alive
Mesmerized by fire you're seduced into flames
Time will tell in your padded cell that you've gone insane

Molten metal flows from the hearth
The nightmare still haunts you from birth
You'll have to fight for your lives
When you hear the Scream in the Night

Ahh...
