Goin' to the show pounding your fists to the air
Heads slamming, brains bashing, it's Over The Top you don't care
Headbanging rats rip this place from the ceiling to the ground
Black night, Metal fight, tear it apart as we pound

Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal

Losing control, feeling the force from the back to the stage
Caught in the spell, 'cause it's louder than hell, gone past the pressures of
pain
Leather 'n spikes strapped to the wrists of this Metal brigade
Like pistons pumping, headbangers pounding, the sound of an army in rage

Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
(Yeah) Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal

Dark night intense fight, bone crushing metal disease
Watts of power, wanting it louder
Noone can stop us when we're pounding

Goin' to the show pounding your fists to the air
Heads slamming, brains bashing, it's Over The Top you don't care
Headbanging rats rip this place from the ceiling to the ground
Black night, Metal fight, tear it apart as we pound

Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
(Yeah) Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
(Pounding) Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal (Rip it apart)
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal (Yeah)
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal (Pounding)
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal (Tear it apart)
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
Pounding Metal, Pounding Metal
