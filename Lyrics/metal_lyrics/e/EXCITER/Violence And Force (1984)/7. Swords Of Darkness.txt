Scorching through the icy skies, filled with manic rage
Battle of the Titans, tonight they will invade
Sorcerers around us behold the demon fire
The Swords of Darkness at their side, veild and awesome power

As the battle rages on, the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around, you're lost within a void

Damned are the defiant, cursed are their souls
Those who've felt the wrath of god, many lives they've stole
Will they ever forget the wicked war they fought
Metal mutants feed upon the corpses as they rot

All you hear are battle cries &amp; blood that pours like rain
Swords of Darkness rule at last &amp; send you to your grave

Now the time is running out you know the end is near
The entity in black has come to feed upon your fears
The wizards cast their final blows to ashes fall the gods
Destruction of another world, the light is all but gone

As the battle rages on the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around you, you're lost within a void

Scorching through the icy skies, filled with manic rage
Battle of the Titans, tonight they will invade
Sorcerers around us behold the demon fire
The Swords of Darkness at their side, veild and awesome power

As the battle rages on, the heavens are destroyed
Darkness falls around, you're lost within a void
