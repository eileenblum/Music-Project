We have the initiative to kill
You will be the prey tonight
Fighting hard shoot you dead at will
We're using hell's fire light
We have the power of the gods
Hallucination filling up your mind
Higher than you've ever been before
Screaming harder this time

Stunning your senses
Blinding your eyes
Submission comes fast when you're hit
Destructor defies

We are the rulers of the land
Decieve us &amp; you shall die
Moving fast killing what we can
We are Destructor we will defy
We'll win the battle in the end
Gleaming swords of metal steal the fight
You shall die a mean &amp; mighty death
With a thunderous roar in the night

Stunning your senses
Blinding your eyes
Submission comes fast when you're hit
Destructor defies

We have the initiative to kill
You will be the prey tonight
Fighting hard shoot you dead at will
We're using hell's fire light
We have the power of the gods
Hallucination filling up your mind
Higher than you've ever been before
Screaming harder this time

Stunning your senses
Blinding your eyes
Submission comes fast when you're hit
Destructor defies
