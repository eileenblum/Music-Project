Battle weary Saxons fight the fight to grip the north
Studded armoured warriors defy this mighty force
On the hill the men all raise their swords up to the sky
An axe strikes the shields of steel, another victim dies

They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire ride tonight

Running 'cross the plains of fire scorched blazing steel
The axe falls on another man screaming through the fields
The mighty sword is seeking men &amp; slicing to the bone
You never can sstain the force to drive these Saxons on

They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire ride... tonight

They're coming out of teh sunset fire, too many to hold back
"Draw your sword you dreaded fool you're under our attack"
Heathen men of distant lands were forced under command
Blood &amp; sweat fall to the earth, the Saxons make a stand

Many men took many slaves on this bloody day
Warriors &amp; savages seeking out their prey
Metal hitting metal in this war for noman's land
Blood &amp; sweat fall to the earth, the Saxons make a stand

The battles over, villages are burning to the ground
The many men who've went to war are lost but never found
Winners are rewarded well, boasting of their scars
Turn toward the blazing sun to quest the land of far

They're coming after you run for your life
Warriors of hell fight the fight
They're coming after you run for your life
Saxons of the Fire riding... tonight
