The kings torment the law
They'll chose to kill us all
Devoured by lust and blood
Cannot retaliate
Tortured and killed by gods
The rivals seek revenge
Of justice till the end

Sadistic, relentless
Sickened with vengeance
Remorsed by nothing
Inspired by the demons

Screams! from the Gallows
Screams! from the Gallows

The night foresees destruction
Rebels gather to emerge
The light evokes deception
Help the masses to escape
The serpents are deadly evils
Their will is not to live
Betrayed by words of honour
Let the tortured people reign

Sadistic, relentless
Sickened with vengeance
Remorsed by nothing
Inspired by the demons

Screams! from the Gallows
Screams! from the Gallows

[Solo]

The kings torment the law
They'll chose to kill us all
Devoured by lust and blood
Cannot retaliate
Tortured and killed by gods
The rivals seek revenge
Of justice till the end

Sadistic, relentless
Sickened with vengeance
Remorsed by nothing
Inspired by the demons

Screams! from the Gallows
Screams! from the Gallows
