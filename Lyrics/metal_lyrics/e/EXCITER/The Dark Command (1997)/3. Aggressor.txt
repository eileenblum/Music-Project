In the depths of an evil mind
Hearing cries of demented thoughts
The anger is strong and the body turns to steel
The aggression is on!
Suicide haunts the ghost of... Death
Metal shield protects the demons of... Hate

In his mind lies a guilt
Tormentor without remorse

Aggressor, Aggressor
Aggressor, Aggressor

Pain and destruction is the rule he must..Obey
Getting orders from the spirits of the... Dead

In his mind lies a guilt
Tormentor without remorse

Aggressor, Aggressor
Aggressor, Aggressor

Clutching his fists for he prepares to get his prey
He will die a man without a grave

In his mind lies a guilt
Tormentor without remorse

[Solo]

Aggressor, Aggressor
Aggressor, Aggressor

Pre...pare... to... be... killed!
