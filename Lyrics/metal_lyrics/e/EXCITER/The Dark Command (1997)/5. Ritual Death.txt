Screams can be heard from a distant place
Blood spills, it can't be traced
Underground cultists are to prepare
A voyage where life is death
Don't be caught by the hand of a Sinner
Tear you apart like dogs in anger
The ritual begins with a prayer full of lies
Destroy - forbid the living

Possessed - by Ritual Death
Possessed - by Ritual Death
Possessed - by Ritual Death
Possessed - by Ritual Death

Slaughter of the innocent souls
Taken by force and ripped from the cross
Torture reveals a man
Insane world, the light shines black
Traumatized by fear
Life and death - the hangman's near
Demons shadow of Hell
Led by the one - they count their spells

Possessed - by Ritual Death
Possessed - by Ritual Death
