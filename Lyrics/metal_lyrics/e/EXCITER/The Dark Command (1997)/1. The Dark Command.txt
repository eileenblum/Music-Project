In the still of the night
Innocence prevails without a guide
Women and children are first to run
To escape the madman, who'll kill till he's done
Kill till he's done...

Dark Command
Dark Command

The savage beast was born in Hell
Heart of the devil no one can tell
The Command is waiting, the weapons are drawn
Halas no one, can make him fall
Can make him fall...

Dark Command
Dark Command

Ripping at the seams
Waiting for life
To come to the end
As the bastards watch the dread

[Solo]

The shallow graves await the souls
The Command is given, the blood will flow
The madman grips and kills his prey
No hope he'll let you, live or survive
Live or survive...

Dark Command
Dark Command
