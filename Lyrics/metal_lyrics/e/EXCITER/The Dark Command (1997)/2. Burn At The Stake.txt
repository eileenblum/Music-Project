Long ago when witches would rule
Deadly women - ready to curse
Black potion of murder and disease
Forgive them for they're blessed...
By the Master!
Burn, Burn at the Stake
Pain, pain until you break

Sixteenth century souls born without sins
Infested by the seeds of the Demon God
Execution day by the knife and sword
Burned alive while crying for death to stop

Burn, Burn at the Stake
Pain, pain until you break

[Solo]

Rotting skin collected by the cross
Innocent victims caught in a web of law
Dying for a crime they did not commit
Cries of evil women - in the dark of the night

Burn, Burn at the Stake
Pain, pain until you break
