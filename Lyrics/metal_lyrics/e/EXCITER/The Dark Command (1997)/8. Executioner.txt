A thousand years of severed heads
Crashes down, you're about to kneel
Warrior cries deadened to silence
The sky turns black, your breath runs out
Beg for mercy - pray fro your life
For the evil mask will wait and say mass
Execute, execute, Executioner
Execute, execute, Executioner

Sacred hymns are heard by the dead
They'll save you from the blow of the axe
The bells of Hell will call out your name
Long before your time can be saved
Rats and dogs will crawl from beneath
Waiting for death to fall like a stone

Execute, execute, Executioner
Execute, execute, Executioner

[Solo]

Rotting flesh and scenes of horror
Screams in the night, death takes its toll
Unleashed by demons urge
To kill and kill - his only will
Executed - one by one
This day - is Devil's play

Execute, execute, Executioner
Execute, execute, Executioner
