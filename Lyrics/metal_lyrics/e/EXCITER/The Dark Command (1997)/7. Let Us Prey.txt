I don't understand it
Why we must be slaughtered dead
For Kingdom Come... waits no more...
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey

Stronger than a thousand black witches
Back to kill the Iron Man
Stand - Raise your fist and chant
I won't be chosen to die

Let Us Prey!

See the hordes of Evil masters
Marching side by side
While Hell awaits for the crucifix to rise

Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey

[Solo]

I don't understand it
Why we must be slaughtered dead
For Kingdom Come... waits no more...

Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
Let Us Prey
