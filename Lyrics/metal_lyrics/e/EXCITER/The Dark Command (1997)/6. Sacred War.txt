Invincible warriors -lead the nation
Striking with vengeance - the glory and pride
Battle hymns are chanted - a thousand voices strong
Divided by armour and weapons of steel

Forbidden - Sacred War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Sacred... War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Sacred... War... War

Watch the enemy, they'll stab you in the back
No laws, no accusations - forces shout in vain
Defying the rest now, the real war commences
A time of misery - that shall not be

Forbidden - Sacred War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Sacred... War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Sacred... War... War

[Solo]

The death dealer's shout - commits his war crimes
Remembering the lives - that fought without shields
A mass bloodied murder - the fate of humanity
Sabotaged prisoners vanish without a trace

Forbidden - Sacred War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Sacred... War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Forbidden - Sacred War
Sacred... War... War... War...
Sacred War - Sacred War
