It lives in the blackened night
It lurks in the valley of the lost
A voice is heard from the past
It's coming back to claim its freedom
Tremors fall from the souls
Chains are broken beckoning call
Life will end, all sins will crawl
Stop the torture blood must flow

Suicide, Suicide
Suicide, Suicide
Suicide, Suicide
Suicide, Suicide
Overdose

The key lies under your skin
Your thoughts are governed by the Ruler
The Ruler dies - you take revenge
Suicide - your death contends
Shadows of the dark call your name
Angels of death can't relent
Desperate cries to kill yourself
Peace be with you... see you again
