Face the Evil mentor of this place
Dying but not praying for this slaughter to cease
Death defying urge to severe life
Devils will chant the deeds of victory
Assassins in Rage of...
Assassins in Rage of... Domination

Murdered by revolt, number rise in the night
Haunted and scared, escaped assassins beware

Assassins in Rage of...
Assassins in Rage of... Domination

Free the world - from disaster
Free the world - from brutal death
Stop the violence - spare the innocent
Kill the man who'll kill in rage

Face the Evil mentor of this place
Dying but not praying for this slaughter to cease
