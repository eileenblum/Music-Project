Hey little honey come along with me
Want you take a free ride
I'm livin' in the lust of the power of love
Want you by my side
Going to make you sweat, going to make you burn
Heavy metal thunder's rising fast
You got to take your turn
Break the chains I'm commin' out, I'm moving fast Looking for a hot time here tonight
Got to make it last
Gonna wreck the town, gonna make you burn
Come little honey for the time it takes
Got to make you learn

Heavy metal maniac
I'm a heavy metal maniac
Stand back heavy metal maniac

Charging like thunder for your love
Got to make you hot
Looking for a hot time here tonight
Show me what you've got
Gonna break the chains, gonna break away
Heavy metal thunder's rising fast gotta make
You stay

Break the wall I'm coming out
Gotta kill tonight
Better stay back I'm a maniac looking for a fight
Gonna track you down you're shot to hell
Come on little honey for the time it takes
Got to make you tell

Heavy metal maniac
I'm a heavy metal maniac
Stand back heavy metal maniac
