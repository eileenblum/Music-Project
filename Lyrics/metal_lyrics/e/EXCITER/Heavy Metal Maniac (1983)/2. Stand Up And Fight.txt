Did your parents ever tell you to stay away from rock and roll
Don't you ever tell them we're more than a million strong
Taking your life stealing your soul
don't ya know it won't be long

Attacked by forces blown to the ground
we're an army like soldiers more than a million strong

We'll tear this place down with your sadistic power
Get mean to the forces of wrong
Break down the walls, feel the curse
Don't ya know it won't be long

Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight for the metal in your blood
Get mean to the forces of wrong
Sounds of raging thunder metal lust
Don't you know it won't be long
