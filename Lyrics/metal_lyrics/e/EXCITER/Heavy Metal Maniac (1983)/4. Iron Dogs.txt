Lusting for rock in the streel spitting blood all around
Fear turns to hate as the kids rule whole town
Keeping ahead of the ones who deceive in the band
spreading this world of their trust for ones in the band

Iron dogs - cram in the seating
Iron dogs - scream for the band
Iron dogs - Rule in this meeting
Iron dogs - Eat the city

Crash all the gates as they crash all the walls of the city
old people rum they get killed in the streets out of pity
killers at heart knowing right from the start
what they are after dressing in metal,
screams for the band with their laughter

Iron dogs - cram in the seating
Iron dogs - scream for the band
Iron dogs - Rule in this meeting
Iron dogs - Eat the city

Crash all the gates they're all walking through fire n' hell
mountains could shake with the thunder
they're ringing the bell
vicious as dogs like a pack of black wolves spilling blood
get outta their way they come from below and above
