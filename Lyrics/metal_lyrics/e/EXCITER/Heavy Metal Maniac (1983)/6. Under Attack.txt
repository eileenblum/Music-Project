His hand takes grip on the back of your neck
Frozen with fear you know you're under attack

You're dying to scream but you can't get it out
He shows you his knife and your life is in doubt

He stands and wipes the blood from his knife
The killer, you know has taken another life

You're under attack
Under attack
Under attack
Under attack

Explosive, the shock as he turns toward your face
your face is white with shock,
Mental disgrace

Frozen with fear you know you're under attack
As his hand takes grip on the back of your neck
