High on the mountain she called my name
Evil woman wants to mess with my brain
Darkness and sorcery til I die
Stop what you're doing
I'm just a man
don't believe in your powers woman
Black Witch descendant of hell
Woman of the grave
I'm not the man for you
you don't take me as your slave

At night feeling lonely cry for the only
I would cry for the sun
Blackwitch would take me
dragging me under
I don't want to go and run
Evil ignites heat of the night
crying out with the pain
Blackwitch would take me
dragging me under
I don't wanna go insane

Blackwitch sucking the blood
from my heart with your evil
Blackwitch filling my head
with your spells til I'm dead

Dragging me far circles and
stars in the evil of the fight
Blackwitch would take me
dragging me down
in the black of the night
Blackwitch would take me
blacken my eyes in the evil of her hate
Blackwitch would take me
dragging me under
in the midst of her hate
