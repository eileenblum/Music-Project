In the night at bondage castle
The fright of caged disciples
The butcher has veins of venom
He's ready for a feast of slavery

Power and domination

Viral injections
Silence the cries of mutants
The face of torture
Is behind you waiting

Power and domination

The torturer comes with an axe for thee

Denounced and presumed dead
The death-master is cruel and possessed
He drinks the blood of woman
To satisfy his sick intentions
