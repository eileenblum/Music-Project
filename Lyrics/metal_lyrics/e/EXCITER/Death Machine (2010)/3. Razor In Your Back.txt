I see no reason to inflict your brain
With a metal blade to end your betrayal
Possessed by violence the culprits are fled
Remember this place it will haunt you dead

Razor in your back

Fall to the victims of resurrection
In this place I will dwell
The tower of the cross will not halt crisis
Kneel and bow for your mercy

Razor in your back

Devastation will erupt
The razor's steel will cut you bare
Cast in stone is the oath of the damned
Without sentence slash and retrieve

The fight the grief is demolition
Parasites suicide is the order of Satanism

What has failed in the past?
Is now for real be ready to slash
The valley of torture is in your grasp
Stand and rise your nightmare will be your last

Razor in your back

I see no reason to inflict your brain
With a metal blade to end your betrayal
Possessed by violence the culprits are fled
Remember this place it will haunt you dead

The fight the grief is demolition
Parasites suicide is the order of Satanism
