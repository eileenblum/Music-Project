My blood runs coldAs I lay undeadThe spike that struckMy severed head born again Inflicted woundsHave scarred my raceI have the rightTo challenge my fate Hellfire Beyond the stairsOf heaven and hellI cross a worldOf decaying corpses rise again Hellfire Trapped insideThe gated wallsI wait in peaceTo be born again Hellfire
