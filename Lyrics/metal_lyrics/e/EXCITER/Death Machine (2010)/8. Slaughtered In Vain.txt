Evil insurgents of mayhemReflect the times of slaughterOf ancient warriorsTo the fury of deviless Slaughtered in vain The followers of mastersRelent to indecisionsTo whom the bell of doom calls forThe wounded will degenerate to ashes Slaughtered, slaughteredSlaughtered in vain The sanctions of forcesAre in cites that darkness forgotSedatives are taken by those who cannot copeWith the saw of termination Slaughtered in vain Evil insurgents of mayhemReflect the times of slaughterOf ancient warriorsHeld in hostage Slaughtered, slaughteredSlaughtered in vain Slaughtered, slaughteredSlaughtered in vain
