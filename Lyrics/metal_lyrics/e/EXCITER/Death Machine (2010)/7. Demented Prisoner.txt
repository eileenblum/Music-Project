Metal artillery attack the deranged God Demented prisonersDrive thru the nightDemented prisonersEat rotting flesh Existence with no souls Gutless and dementedForever chained and captiveDoomed from beginningsTo learn their tombs are waiting Symbolic ritualsAre battled by prisonersThe burial of confessionsAwait the priests of Damian Demented prisonersDrive thru the nightDemented prisonersEat rotting flesh Existence with no souls Gutless and dementedForever chained and captiveDoomed from beginningsTo learn their tombs are waiting Bloodless crimesErupt in dangerHeavy artilleryAttack the deranged God Demented prisonersDrive thru the nightDemented prisonersEat rotting flesh Existence with no souls Cathedral of undertakersReveal the door of mutationsThe church of damnationWill praise the king of beasts Symbolic ritualsAre battled by prisonersThe burial of confessionsAwait the priests of Damian Demented prisonersDrive thru the nightDemented prisonersEat rotting flesh Existence with no souls Gutless and dementedForever chained and captiveDoomed from beginningsTo learn their tombs are waiting
