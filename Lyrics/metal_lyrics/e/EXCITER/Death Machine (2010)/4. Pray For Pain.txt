Blackout your deviant soul
Warning from unspeakable sin
Butchered by the unforgiven
The harbinger of destruction

Pray, pray, pray
For pain

Mutations with no mercy
Deviance by Salem's word
Confessions in Satan's tomb
The reaper is my religion

Pray, pray, pray
For pain

Pray, pray, pray
For pain

Awake the spirit of the dead
Abandon the unborn crypt
Vanished by the ripper's reign
Surrender with death comes calling to you

Pray, pray, pray
For pain
