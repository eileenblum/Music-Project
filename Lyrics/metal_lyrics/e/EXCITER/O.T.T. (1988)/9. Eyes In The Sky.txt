Piercing thru the darkness
Hiding in the day
Looking for the answers
'Cause there ain't no other way
Burning in the night time
To find the hidden clues
Tracking the suspected
Metal eyes are all on you

What's the score, who's ahead
Gonna wind up dead
What's the cause, who's to blame
It's a crazy game, one crazy game

Look to the starlight
There'll be eyes in the sky
Out of the darkness
Feel the eyes in the sky

Digitizing circuits
Trace a secret path
Staring down the barrel
To explode oncoming wrath
Terrifying madness
A suicidal view
Sinking in oppression
There is nothing left to do

What's the score, who's ahead
Gonna wind up dead
What's the cause, who's to blame
It's a crazy game, one crazy game

Look to the starlight
There'll be eyes in the sky
Out of the darkness
Feel the eyes in the sky

What's the score, who's ahead
Gonna wind up dead
What's the cause, who's to blame
It's a crazy game, one crazy game

Look to the starlight
There'll be eyes in the sky
Out of the darkness
Feel the eyes in the sky

What's the score, who's ahead
Gonna wind up dead
What's the cause, who's to blame
It's a crazy game, one crazy game

Look to the starlight
There'll be eyes in the sky
Out of the darkness
Feel the eyes in the sky

Look to the starlight
There'll be eyes in the sky
