Hold tough, stand my ground
Play alone, won't play the clown
Some say I sealed my fate
And threw the key away

Now I feel the power
Surge inside of me
I'll be the man I wanna be
I'm tellin' you I'm gonna be

King of the castle
Ruler of the land
King of my destiny
The power's in my hand
I wanna be king

No way! People say
Loneliness is the price to pay
Wasting my time to claim the crown

Now I feel the power
Surge inside of me
I'll be the man I wanna be
I'm tellin' you I'm gonna be

King of the castle
Ruler of the land
King of my destiny
The power's in my hand
King of the castle
Ruler of the sky
King of the castle
You won't ask why

King of the castle
Ruler of the land
King of my destiny
The power's in my hand
I wanna be king, I wanna be king
I wanna be king, I wanna be king
