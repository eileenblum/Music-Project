In the land of the wasted world
No escaping the lies
You can't run, you can't hide away
Here I come, can't be exorcised

Vengeance burning red
Now I am back, full speed ahead

Stand to rock
I'm taking control this time
Bang your heads
'Cause I'm back in the light
When you thought I was dead

In the past I have been the fool
Losing once what was mine
Thru the course I've put names to face
To avenge and return in time

Vengeance burning red
Now I am back, full speed ahead

Stand to rock
I'm taking control this time
Bang your heads
'Cause I'm back in the light
When you thought I was dead
Thought I was dead
Now I'm back, back in the light again

In the land of the wasted world
No escaping the lies
You can't run, you can't hide away
Here I come, can't be exorcised

Vengeance burning red
Now I am back, full speed ahead

Stand to rock
I'm taking control this time
Bang your heads
'Cause I'm back in the light
When you thought I was dead
Thought I was dead
Now I'm back, back in the light again
I'm back in the light
