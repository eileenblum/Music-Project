Does things for shock effect
Oh Yeah! He takes the cake
Picture of intellect, spaceman
What a waste

O.T.T. His brain on overload
O.T.T. He's off the wall
Over the top

Says things he'll soon regret
He knows what to do, to you
Dressing to strange excess
Ya know it's all for you, it's true

O.T.T. His brain on overload
O.T.T. He's off the wall
Over the top

Does things for shock effect
Oh Yeah! He takes the cake
Picture of intellect, spaceman
What a waste

O.T.T. His brain on overload
O.T.T. He's off the wall
Over the top, over the top, over the top
