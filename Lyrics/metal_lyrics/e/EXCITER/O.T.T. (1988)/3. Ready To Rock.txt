I fall out of bed
Bang my head on the bedroom floor
It's one of those days
I know you've seen it all before
A bottle of Jack
And I'm ready to go again
Forget about it all
And wait for the show to begin

So come on, shout it
Give it all you've got, hey!
Your heart will be the way
Feel it, metal rules the will
You can't hear enough
And you won't sit still
You're ready, ready to rock
I know you're ready, ready to rock

Alcohol is burnin' puttin' pressure on me
The only way to fight back society

So come on, shout it
Give it all you got, hey!
Your heart will be the way
Feel it, metal rules the will
You can't hear enough
And you won't sit still
You're ready, ready to rock
I know you're ready, ready to rock

Ready to rock
I know you're ready, ready to rock
You're ready, ready to rock
I know you're ready, ready to rock
I know you're ready, ready to rock
