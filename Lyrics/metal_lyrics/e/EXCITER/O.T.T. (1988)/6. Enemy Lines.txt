You spit lies in my face
You always run me down
I'll put you in your place
Leave no sign, no trace, no sound

You better look behind
Danger, beware
Listen to what's being said
You better turn around
I'm gonna track you down
When you're behind, my enemy lines

Enemy lines! Enemy lines!

Flat on your back, off the track
Is where you're gonna be
Think of you, think of me
In endless misery

You better look behind
Danger, beware
Listen to what's being said
You better turn around
I'm gonna track you down
When you're behind, my enemy lines

Enemy lines! Enemy lines!
Shoot ya! Shoot ya down, way down

Enemy lines! Enemy lines!
I'll put you in your place
Leave no sign, no trace
Enemy lines! Shoot ya!
Shoot ya down, way down
