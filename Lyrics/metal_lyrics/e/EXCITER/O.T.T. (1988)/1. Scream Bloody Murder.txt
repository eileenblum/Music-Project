You don't know what you do to me
My love knows no bounds
The wishing well is all but gone
And you're nowhere to be found
I'll track you down and tie you up
I'll feed you my love
So wake up bitch and pray to the Lord above

Scream bloody murder
As my love enters you
You'll scream bloody murder
There's nothing you can do
Girl if you think that you're leavin'
Without a fight
You've got another thing coming
You'll see the light

Take good care when you talk to me
I might be insane
Don't just stare
Look what you did to my brain

Scream bloody murder
As my love enters you
You'll scream bloody murder
There's nothing you can do
Girl if you think that you're leavin'
Without a fight
You've got another thing coming
You'll see the light

Scream bloody murder
As my love enters you
You'll scream bloody murder
There's nothing you can do
You'll be screamin', screamin'
Scream bloody murder!
