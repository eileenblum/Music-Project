We've got the power
To take the world by storm
Placing wheels in motion
Setting course for evermore
Breaking down defenses
Forging our own ways
We're burning, burning alive
Look out, get outta the way

You're playing with fire
You're playing with fire

Louder than thunder
We crack the sky in two
Hell on wheels of fire
Shaking the world for you
Highway bound at full speed
Screaming all the way
We're comin', beattin' the odds
You're the spark and we're the flames

You're playing with fire
You're playing with fire

We've got the power
To make your dreams come true
We are burning desire
The flame inside the youth
Taking on the darkness
Rebels till we die
We're the trigger that fires the gun
The lightning in the sky

You're playing with fire
You're playing with fire
You'll get burned
You're playing with fire
It's hotter than hell
Fire!
