Locked in the dark
Hell take you back
Burden of sin
Tortured and chained

Sword of the Reich
Rips and impales
Agents of doom
Wrath of the skulls

Chamber the prisoners
Worship the dead
Bury the living
Tear them... to shreds

Commander of rage
In darkness and light
Shot in the head
By demons of night

Driven to kill
Creeping unknown
Disciples unite
The feast has begun

Massacre, massacre
Mountain

Brave and enforced
Resist no more
Masters demise
Hatred inside

Price of deceit
Answer is grief
Ride with the wind
Mountain of pain

Chamber the prisoners
Worship the dead
Bury the living
Tear them... to shreds
