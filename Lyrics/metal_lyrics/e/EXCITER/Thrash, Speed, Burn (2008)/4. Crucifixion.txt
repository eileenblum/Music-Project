Crucifixion, Satan's cross
Is he mad or is he God
Trapped alive in your own tomb
Damn the peasants
You know you're doomed

Crucifixion, Satan's cross
Fear the one who'll bring you down
Behold the flame
Of the sorcerer's name
You will rise when darkness falls

Crucifixion, Satan's cross
Is he mad or is he God
Trapped alive in your own tomb
Damn the peasants
You know you're doomed

War!
And rage
Is the curse
Of the wishing well

Fight!
And resist
The pain and sorrow
Of the demon's guilt

Cries come from the grave
Cries come from the grave
Rise from the flames
Strength and power from the grave
Shout and scream
Defend the Reich's infernal reign

Rising from the flames
Rising from the flames

[Solo]

War!
And rage
Is the curse
Of the wishing well

Shout and scream
Defend the Reich's infernal flame

Crucifixion, Satan's cross
Is he mad or is he God
Trapped alive in your own tomb
Fear the one who brings your doom
