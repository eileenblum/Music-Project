Hangman [x2]

Slayer of mutants has summoned you to fall
Confined to the cage... Where the hideous
Legends are born
The sky is screaming
Turning to blood
The guilty are beaten and hung
One by one

Hangman
Driven insane
Hangman
Evil remains

Murderous torturer glaring deep into your eyes
The hangman is skillful at crafting your gradual demise
The menace creeping
Evil is loose
Driven by vengeance his captives are led
To the noose

Hangman
Feasting on pain
Hangman
Torment's his gain
Metal crescendo
Verse one

Hangman
Driven insane
Hangman
Torture in vain
No! oh!
