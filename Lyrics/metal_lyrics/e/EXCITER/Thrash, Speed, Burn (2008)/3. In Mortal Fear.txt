Die
For sanctuary
Break the chains
And rule again

Die
For sanctuary
The Antichrist
Will immortalize

In mortal fear [x2]
War! [x2]

Flow
From wombs of demons
The ravens curse
At darkest hour

Ride
The blackened sky
Hunt the devil
In Hell's disguise

In mortal fear [x2]
War! [x2]

The Antichrist
Will immortalize
The savage beast
Will punish
Who lies

[Solo]

Command
Eternal veins
Of mammoth power
That kills its king

Rise
From madman's craze
The last survives
The weak Demise

In mortal fear [x2]
War! [x2]

The Antichrist
Will immortalize
The savage beast
Will punish
Who lies
In mortal fear!
