Evil omen [x4]

Face anger
At the end of time
Phantom lies
In the pit of the crucified
Face the terror
Of troubled lands
Phantom lies
In the pit of the crucified

Evil omen [x4]

The baron reigns
He spews his rot
Banished
Are the creatures of the night
Tales of torture
Rise again
Shadow souls
Rip the life from the innocent

Evil omen [x4]

[Solo]

Evil omen [x4]

Tales of gore
Cast a spell
The booming voice
Of the dark prince fills the air
Night stalker
In shadows he hides
The final prayer
For the one chosen to die

Evil omen [x4]

The black hand of hell
Burning cross held in hand
The black hand of hell
Grinding flash across the land
[x2]

[Gang vocal:]
The black hand of hell [x12]
The black, the black
The black hand of hell!
