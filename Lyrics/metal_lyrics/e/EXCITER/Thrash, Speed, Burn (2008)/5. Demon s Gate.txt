When death
Comes calling
You'll hear the howl
Of frantic cries
At the gates
Your soul
Isn't forgotten

Drowning in blood
Unholy stones

Crushed to dust
Howling forces of darkness
Quest at its end
The edge of terror
Rages on
The oath
That I will keep
Hostile and demonic
Is a vicious attack

[Chorus:]
Demon's gate [x2]

[Solo]

Birthing your deadly sins
Venting your carnage
Your twisted mind screams
Murderous lust
Killer, must kill again
Leaving the dying
Pleading for a merciful end to the wrath
Of this
Titan in black

[Chorus:]
Demon's gate [x2]
