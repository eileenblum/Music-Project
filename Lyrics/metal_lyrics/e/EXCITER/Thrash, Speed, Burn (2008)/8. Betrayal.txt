Unleash
The persecution
Rise from
My slaughtered soul
Unknown master
Enslaves you
Night rage
Entombs you

[Chorus:]
Betrayal [x4]

Cauldron
Of immortals
Red death
For those in sorrow
Cryptic signs of torture
Sinners face damnation

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Your will is my strength
Walk through fire to be one of them
The steel vault where the weak shall
Fall locked into chambers of

Betrayal [x2]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]

Your will is my strength
Walk through fire to be one of them
The steel vault where the weak shall
Fall locked into chambers of

Betrayal
Locked in chambers of betrayal [x3]
