Defiant, relentless
Refuse to die
In shadows, oblivion
The cellar's cage

Disciples of terror
Gather for prayers
The viral Damnation
Infects the prey

As kingdom burns
Your brethren cries
The coven of which you breed
This strike will end your greed
Rot the devil king

The towers of evil
Burn to the ground
Nefarious, the funeral
Of wicked lords

Invasion of liars
Will gouge your eyes
The blood rain will fall
And cleanse your lives

As kingdom burns
Your brethren cries
The coven of which you breed
This strike will end your greed
Rot the devil king
Shattered be the reign
Scorch his final days
Rot the devil king

[Solo]

Now risen
Bane monarch
With heavy chain
No savior, No quarter
All traitors slain
The floodgates
To Hades
Open remain
Inverted high priesthood
Allegiance feigned

As kingdom burns
Your brethren cries
The coven of which you breed
This strike will end your greed
Rot the devil king
Shattered be thy reign
Scorch his final days
Rot the devil king

Defiant, Relentless
Refuse to die
In shadows, oblivion
The cellars cage

Disciples of terror
Gather for prayers
The viral damnation
Infects the prey
