Thunder is my sound
As I'm burning' thru' the town
Wind's blowin' my hair
As the people just stand and stare
Past the speed of light
I'm burnin' up,the scream of the bike
You must step aside
I'm a wicked machine in the night

I'm livin',I'm ridin'
Addicted to leather and speed
Live fast - Die young
Die young

I live for today
No one's standing in my way
'Cross the desert I ride
With an army by my side
We love the action at night
I'm speeding up together in flight
I'll never change in my ways
I'm the terror that won't go away

I'm livin',I'm ridin'
Addicted to leather and speed
Live fast - Die young

Darkness lies ahead
Speed is poundin' thru' my head
Heading straight for disaster
But I don't care,I'm pushin' it faster
Leave the city at night
Into the red I'm revving the bike
There's no time to turn
Into the wall my life slowly burns

Not livin',I'm dyin'
A victim of leather and speed
Live fast,die young
Die young,live fast
Die young,live fast
Die young,live fast
Die young

[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee]
