Put thru' the grinder but we survived
Why can't you see that this is our lives
Heading out for the fast lane,pulling out to pass
We are the mighty,the weak never last

The only way we know is to fight
We love to feel the noise
To give our all every night
Mission destroy

Yes,we've been kicked down but stronger we rise
We thrive to deliver despite your ways adn lies
Our backs to the wall 'cause we're sick of your kind
Ya we've met you before and we'll crush you this time

The only way we know is to fight
We love to feel the noise
To give our all every night
Mission destroy

Mission destroy - We'll fight till the very end
Mission destroy - Killing for self-defense

In the ears of the wicked the truth is always heard
It's the way of the tyrant to never keep his word
Heading for a breakdown then fighting back the heat
This is our mission,to over-come defeat

We're back and hungry,ready to fight
It's time to feel the noise
Standing tall, defending our rights
Mission destroy

Mission destroy - We'll fight till the very end
Mission destroy - Killing for self-defense

I wanna hear you
I wanna see you
Just stand up strong for your rights tonight
Don't let 'em push you
Don't let 'em break you
Just keep your guard up,keep up the fight

Mission destroy - We'll fight till the very end
Mission destroy - Killing for self-defense
Mission destroy - We'll fight till the very end
Mission destroy - Killing for self-defense

[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee]
