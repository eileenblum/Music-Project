You are the prowler
The one with killing eyes
You're in the back of our minds
At night you're stalking
Waiting ever still
You love to screw and then to kill
You're a spark without a flame
In the dark it's all the same
Who will you take to love this time
Now you'll pay for all your crimes

I feel the terror every night
Waiting in the dark
I'm always fearing for my life
Waiting in the dark

Dress up at sundown
You're such a pretty sight
You're just a lady of the night
Under the make-up
Is what they really see
Psychotic killer runnin' free
You're a spark without a flame
In the dark it's all the same
Who will you take to love this time
Now you'll pay for all your crimes

I feel the terror every night
Waiting in the dark
I'm always fearing for my life
Waiting in the dark

You walk in shadows alone in the streets
Too scared to look at your man as he speaks
You drag him onward home to your bed
Another victim,next day he's dead

Yeah - Yeah
You are the prowler
The one with killing eyes
You're in the back of our minds
At night you're stalking
Waiting ever still
You love to screw and then to kill
You're a spark without a flame
In the dark it's all the same
Who will you take to love this time
Now you'll pay for all your crimes

I feel the terror every night
Waiting in the dark
I'm always fearing for my life
Waiting in the dark
I feel the terror every night
Waiting in the dark
I'm always fearing for my life
Waiting in the dark
