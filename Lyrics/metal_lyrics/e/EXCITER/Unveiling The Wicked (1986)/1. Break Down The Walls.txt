I live for the night - I'm a bringer of fright
Here to take your life - I'm a sinner that's right
Filling your heads with pain,making you writhe and bleed
I'll destroy this place,making you scream

Ah - Ah
Ah - Ah

Break down the walls - Break down the walls
Break down the walls - Break down the walls

I torture your brain - I'm the bringer of pain
Tear and grind at your mind,watching you falling insane
In the depths of teh dark I can hear you screaming for your life
Cannons are ready for fire you're in the sights

Ah - Ah
Ah - Ah

Break down the walls - Break down the walls
Break down the walls - Break down the walls

I live for the night - I'm a bringer of fright
Here to take your life - I'm a sinner that's right
Filling your heads with pain,making you writhe and bleed
I'll destroy this place,making you scream

Ah - Ah
Ah - Ah

Break down the walls - Break down the walls
Break down the walls - Break down the walls

[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee]
