He thrives on brutal sport
Takes pleasure from the pain
Murder shrouds his every move
Legend tells his tale
Of undead lords of war
In the dark the killing starts

Die in the night - Die in the night
Die in the night - Die in the night

A villain of the night
He's ruling with his might
Take by force,well of course
He's driven by his lust
His kind we can not trust
Plot to kill,yes he will

Die in the night - Die in the night
Die in the night - Die in the night

He's feeding evil lies
To unsuspecting prey
His lust for blood never stops,no
Nocturnal in his ways
He'll cast a spell of charms
He spins a web you can't escape

Die in the night - Die in the night
Die in the night - Die in the night
Die in the night - Die in the night
Die in the night - Die in the night...

[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee]
