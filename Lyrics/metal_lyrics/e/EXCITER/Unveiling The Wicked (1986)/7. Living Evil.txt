He comes from nowhere
He can burn like the sun
He's in your dreams and in the souls of everyone
He'll walk the water
And come down from the sky
I think we're doomed,he's coming for you and I
I sense the anger
I feel his heart poundin'
Here he comes look-out
Just raise your fists and shout

I'm living Evil - I'm living Evil
I'm living Evil - I'm living Evil

I feel the power,I feel it in my head
Last night I dreamed of it,I'm dreaming of the dead
He sends his prophets to make us do his wrong
I hear the voices cry now I'm feeling strong
I sense the anger
I feel his heart poundin'
Here he comes look-out
Just raise your fists and shout

I'm living Evil - I'm living Evil
I'm living Evil - I'm living Evil

It's time to rise up,it's time to make a stand
He is the fool,don't obey the black command
I am the ruler,the one that noone tries
But I see the evil underneath it's dark disguise
I sense the anger
I feel his heart poundin'
Here he comes look-out
Just raise your fists and shout

I'm living Evil - I'm living Evil
I'm living Evil - I'm living Evil
I'm living Evil - Evil - Yeah
I'm living Evil - Evil - Yeah...

[Beehler, Johnson, McPhee]
