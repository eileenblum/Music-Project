I got up late,five to nine
I missed the bus,I losing my mind
Another day I'm off to school
Another day to break the rules
Got caught smokin' in the halls
The principal is after my balls
Teachers here don't understand me
I just wanna be free - Say it

I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules

(Where's your homework?) - I ain't got it done
I'd like to change the way things are run
They met my mom at the PTA
And said "Your son skipped school today"
Got caught writing on the walls
All my teachers are after my balls
Detention halls are not for me
I just wanna be free - Say it

I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules

Three o'clock and I run for the door
I can't take these rules no more
The teacher grabs me by the hair
"Sit down boy,you ain't goin' nowhere"
I sold my books to buy a guitar
I don't need school to be a star
My only "A" became an "E"
I don't need no degree - Alright

I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules
I - Hate - I hate school rules - Hate school rules

I hate school rules
...
