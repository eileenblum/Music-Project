Mother Earth awaken my sleeping world 
open the gates to an unknown land 
I spread my tired wings and fly away 
and leave behind the weakness of man 

Thousand of screams echoe behind 
but wihtout fear I touch the sky 
Lady of all my sleepless nights 
We'll meet beyond the coulds 

Now I step unto an other world 
into the garden of silent oblivion 
The tortured memories slowly fade 
as I taste the serpent's poisoned lips
