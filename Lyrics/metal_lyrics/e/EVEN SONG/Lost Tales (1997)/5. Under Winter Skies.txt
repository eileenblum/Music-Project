Under the winter sky, as Earth relapses into sleep 
the veil of despair falls like a tired vernal leaf 
As darkness conquers the moon, all the dreams slip away 
Depression comes with large steps, as the slumbering sorrow awakes 

Lustreless stars, vanished silhouettes of sky 
are shedding silver tears with the last moonlight 
And the wishpering winds die away 
as the Earth penetrates with pain
