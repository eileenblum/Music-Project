Beyond the heaven's warm and velvet mist 
wouneded by the thorns of existence 
I'm waiting my last sunset 
in my winterforst palace 

I'll dream of you 
while the shadows touch the ground 
I'll dream of you 
while the candles are burning out 
I'll dream of you 
in my crystal casket 
I'll dream of you 
on your last sunset 

Screams of agony echoe in my head 
as darkness spins the net of silence 
and i'm waiting my last sunset 
in my winterforst palace
