I call you for a midnight ride under the moonlit sky 
Dont't afraid mortal man sister moon is our guide 
Dance under ancient oaks bath in silver lakes 
Come with me mortal one to secret place 

Take my hands and wait for the till 
to see the faeryland upon the hill 
Take my hands and wait for the till 
and listen the faeries sing upon the hill
