Cold wind plucks the string of sorrow 
in a deep and silent forest 
There's no one to caress the wound 
of a dying goddess 

Imprisoned in ancient stones 
in a bittersweet eternity 
while the lashing wings of angels 
pour grief to the ground 
New gods came to the land 
presence of a prayer in the distance 
as teh memories of a forlorn time 
are fading with the sun 

Bleeding forever with the Earth 
embraced by cold tranquility 
die alone in agony
