Crimson dreams take me far away 
far from reality, into an other kind of sleep 
I stand before the gates of my innerself, 
of an unconscious world deep in my mind 

With the key in my hand I open the gates 
a lonely spirit guiding, showing me the way 

Entrance of eternity

Come closer dormant man, step inside 
Take my hands and I ease your cries 
I'm what you want, I'm what you need 
Don't you remember me? 

My soul breaks from this lonely cell of pain 
Yield to the temptation of an eternal way 
My guardian angel, don't let me awake 
Don't let me see those bloody tears
