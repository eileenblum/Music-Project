The moon has thrown her pall 
to look down to our dying land 
and she spills a silver tear for us 
for our long dead heaven 
as we're lying in the great tomb 
of our loneliness 

We've lost our way, lost our tales 
in our own created mist 
Only the vacant eyes of sorrow follow our steps 
We're just empty shades of an empty life 
failed to reach the skies
