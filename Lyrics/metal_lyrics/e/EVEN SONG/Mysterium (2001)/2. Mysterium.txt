How long have we sought after the forbidden gate
that opens into unknown spheres?
How long have we fathomed
the sky for the star-pinioned gods of Space?

Like phantoms of an ancient necropolis
we wander in the labyrinth of Life,
where reigns the dreadful Tyrant,
great Chimera of Time

What evil conjurer evoked us to this horrid world
to this waste realm of gloom?
What supreme, ravenous and insatiable will
rent us from our empyreal abode?

How could we defy the old seraphic ban
and re-enter the fabled gates of heavens?
