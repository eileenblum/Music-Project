What luminous galaxies have been thy prey
O, all-consuming, restrainless Space?
What gyres of planets sunk in thy voidness absolute
O, indivisible infinity?

O, unrevealed Abyss,
whose deep sustains flaming, triumphant suns,
what further,distant worlds doth thee hide
in thy universe-ulterior vast?

O, direful chasm,
elder gods' necropolis,
what star-possessed realms
rest within thy depths?
