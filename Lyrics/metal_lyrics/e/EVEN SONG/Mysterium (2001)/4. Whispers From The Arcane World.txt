Now as the Night takes form upon the face of sun
and new shadows appear upon the lone, phantasmagoric sky
a world, hidden and arcane, arise
from cryptical depths, hinderless and stark

One with night's perplexed mystery
unrevealed by the scyhted moon's light
phantoms of times remote gather
beneath the bizzare, livid sky

Behold this darkling realm
filled with mysteries of aeons bygone
Step inside the darkness that lays bare the secret spheres
of the dream-woven sisterworld

Beyond these phantasm-guarded gates
where gyving Time and Space are not
awaits a world ulterior, a realm unexplored
large as Infinity

Now as the Night takes form upon the face of sun
and new shadows appear upon the lone, phantasmagoric sky
a world, hidden and arcane, arise
from cryptical depths, hinderless and stark

Behold, this is a stranger earth,
a moonlight-drenched, enchanted land
a world wherein all the cares of life are forgot
a long-sought realm of wonder
