Once under starry heavens
a garden was planted
a wondrous work in the waste wilderness
where lions walked in humility

Once the Sons Of Eternal Joy reigned upon the Earth
and angelic myriad ruled the skies

In his celestial abode the Old One slumbered
the one who formed the world into existence

It was a golden age 
era of beauty &amp; joy
Death was not, nor iniquity
the fountain of eternal life sprung

The Infernal Serpent laid on the verge of non-entity
a doleful shade before the immense gates of Infinity

Once man walked the heavenly path
in sweet ignorance
enchanted by the unearthly beauty of Eden
in ecstatic joy

Once the Daughters Of Light danced
in that realm of mild moony lustre
