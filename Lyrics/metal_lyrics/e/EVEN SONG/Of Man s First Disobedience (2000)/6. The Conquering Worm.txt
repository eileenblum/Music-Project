Terrible spires &amp; monoliths
under unvanquished skies
A vast ivory-black tower
in Night's hellish-black mire

A brooding dark power
a spreading black world
Some said: It's Babylon
the abominable realm of Man

Standing tall like a steadfast giant
eclipsing the stars, usurping heavens
a phantom world in the sickening light
a vast monument of perverseness

Now We worship Satan, the Bringer Of Light
Oh you, Selfish Father, you left us on that horrid night
We forgot Eden, the Garden of Joy
our eternal life like a dream dissolved

O, God of Almighty Heavens
who will save us from perdition?
Shall our immortal vigour return
or shall we drown with the Stygian flood?
