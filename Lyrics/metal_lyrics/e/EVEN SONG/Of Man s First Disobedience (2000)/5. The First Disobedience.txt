A bittersweet taste of that Forbidden Fruit
Entice of Evil -a Serpent in every bosom

We lay naked in the wind, in shame &amp; fear
exiled into a solitary night, rent from Eternity
o Times Remote, Blissful Ignorance

Would a Forgiving Father
take such a vengeance
upon his beloved children

Did Jesus weep for us?
No I don't think so
we're the sin-bred offsprings of Judas
The One who sits high on the sky
on an empyreal throne
is not our Father

Was it just a dream?
The God upon his mercy seat 
Was it just an illusion?
Our Divine Abode

A Hell for each Vice
for every Disobedience
Alone in the Great Wilderness
in a night of vast durance
