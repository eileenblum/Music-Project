(The self-begotten deity)

The steadfast Earth shuddered
roaring fires ran over heavens
in tears &amp; howling embodied
a female form: Mother of all beings

Like a faint shadow she rose from the ground
trembling &amp; pale like a new-born child
beneath her feet a vast, unprolific ground
above her head the indefinite space

For ages she wandered in the forsaken wilderness
searching for life-forms
She found nothing but a dire emptiness
a soul-shuddering Vacuum

Whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke
torrents of lava, vapour &amp; clouds
terrible thunders tore the mantle of Earth
unquenchable fires consumed the ground

Her lamenting voice wept upon the void
but there were no one to hear her
She was alone in a world of inertia
divided by tears &amp; sorrows 

From the vast deluge of her tears
an unfathomable ocean rose
An ocean teemed with strange organism
and creatures bred in sorrow

Various forms of being crawled out from the sea
and mustard around the great Mother
And she rejoiced beholding her daughters &amp; sons
and gave them the Earth &amp; the Skies to conquer
