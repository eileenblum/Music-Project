A frozen Galaxy drifted
in Nature's amniotic seas
a universe of starry majesty
in the vast ocean of Space

Black planets rolled
without lustre and aim
in the yawning dark Void

It was the dawn of times
the dawn of Genesis
the age of mystery

Motionless stars
without name &amp; knowledge
a cosmic empire
in the stifling black fluid

The world waited its own birth
in an icy, uninvaded sleep
And the Great Omnipotent slumbered
on the verge of the deep

A cosmic empire
a slumbering galaxy
A cosmic empire
in the cradle of eternity
