In whirlwinds of tempestuous fires
a phantasm rose upon heavens
....a fearful Eidolon

Lucifer was his name in Eternity
the Father of Pestilence
Monarch of the Sulphurous Empire
Arch Enemy of Heavens

Wanton enormity 
from the flames of eternal fury
delighting in blood
armed with destruction &amp; plagues

The Black Angel stood at the centre of all infinity
with ambitious aim against the Monarchy of God 

Loathsome in a serpent-like form
he descended into the blissful garden
a guileful reptile, a King of Tyre
Master of Temptation
