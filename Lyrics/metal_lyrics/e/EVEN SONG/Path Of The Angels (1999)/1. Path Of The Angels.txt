Ruler of my dreams, angelic being
calm me down at last
Bury me among clads of shallow graves
or raise me above the enchanting clouds
Swallow me the Earth's lukewarm womb
let me fly upon the wings of morning breeze
cease burning like the distant star
who has thrown away his light
I pray for absolution
Shall I find solace in death?
Save me angel
I yearn for Nepenthe
Angel of unveiled beauty
Aery being of Heavens
Divine eyes are staring
I'm filled with fear oh mistress of dreams
as I step on the path of the angels
whee heaven meets the ground
Slaughterous time embraces
I feel my transience
Leave those sickening shades of existence
I open the gates of infinity
Just close your weary eyes
I'll take you way up to the skies
Child of Terra Firma
Being of murk and dust 
I tear up the texture of reality
Step unto the path of the angels
