I'm dying on the battlefield of opposites
between dreams and reality
Somehow I've lost my way in this maze
And I still hear the laughter of Gods

How do I yearn for a dance with the Angels
In the heat of the moonlit night
A taste of the nectarine fruit of eternity
a ship from the chalice of dreams

Father - look what I have became
I'm a wolf among the lambs, a dreamlike phantasm
What you've done to me God of Man?
I used to be an angel once, but now...
