In the howling silence
a blind angel descended into Earth
he put his fingers on your mouth and eyes,
 and stole your last breath

The empty face of the full-moon
has broken to thousand of painful pieces
eternity suddenly became unmasked,

Remained nothing but a frozen dream
in the eyes of a dying bird,
and a lonely teardrop
in the middle of the lost paradise

Fly wingless bird, fly away
memories of your life
will never fade away
