A serpent slumbers in the garden of innocence
hidden from cherubs' glowing eyes
Father of lust, sentinel of knowledge
who saw the angels learning to fly 
"I show you a world of dreams and desires
a sweet asylum beyond the clouds
Travel me through sunken empires
to the home of joy and equilibrium 
While the gods were fighting for the soul of Man
I regained lost paradise
So drop the burden of millenniums
and follow me my dearest child"
