Say, oh, say my faithful seraph
where to find some peace
my languid heart is so heavy
and my whisper can't break through the still 
Sundown brings no sleep
and in my eyes sets no morning
Oblivion
that's all I'm asking for
Oblivion
the poisoned gift of gods 
The silken meadows rock so softly
while my soul is a monolith
I can't feel the cool zephyr
and it's perfume dazes me not
