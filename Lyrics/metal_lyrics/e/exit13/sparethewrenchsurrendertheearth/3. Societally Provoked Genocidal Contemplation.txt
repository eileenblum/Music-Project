This whole world is fucking sick!!!
Human stupidity had made me crazed!
Insanity frees my mind to wander...
I gleefully ponder humanity's murder!

Thoughts of slaughter fill my head.
I want to make all humans dead.
To free the of the ills that manifest from diseased wills.
My remedy for Earth's situation, is total human being negation!!!

Radical global extermination.
The venting of my crazed frustration.
Plants and animals would rejoice.
Freed from human ploys.
I've been dismissed as being sick...
"Environmentally romantic", but I will have the final laugh.
As my own species feels my wrath!!!

No more factories polluting the air I breath!
No more authority blatantly surppressing me!
No more politics, mere games for the ethically sick!
No more fighting wars, human beings will destroy no more!!!

No I'm alone, in solitude I freely roam...
But I'm going mad contemplating the good times past...
"..so I enact a frazzled new plan, splattering my brains across this"

now free land!
