Why should I even bother to acknowledge the pathetic notions of 

minds without knowledge?
I have been chastised for acting too freely, but individualism for me 

is the key, see?

Why should I style my pattern of life after those who bring about 

hatred and strife?
I would much rather have a mellow existence of celebration and 

productive subsistence!

My minds mine!

Individuality, creativity, self - mastery...not for you?
Sensibility, originality, responsibility...not for you?
Stability, free mentalities, global harmony...not for you?

Stupidity, live destructively, "self" is all you see...is this you?
Pathetic apathy, Christianity, no mentality...is this you?
Spreading misery, no flexibility, lost and lazy...is this you?

So in conclusion, let's ignite a struggle for total transcendence 

from this confining muddle!
It seems to me simple, just strive for mental freedom, don't end up 

like our parents, tranquilized by their stupidity!
