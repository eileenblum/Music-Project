Unreal escapades, false information,
Your negativity impelos,
The lies you pour out aren't conveincing
Attemps of looking good have failed.

The constant plague of social status.
Take your image out of hand,
But your masterplan is reversing,
You can't meet your own demands.
You can't meet your own demands.

No identity to call your own,
As you hide behind insecure fears,
Can you take control of your life?
Or relinguish it to your peers?
