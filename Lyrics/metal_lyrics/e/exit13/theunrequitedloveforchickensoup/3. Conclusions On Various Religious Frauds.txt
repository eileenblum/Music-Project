Belief shouldn't come from your wallet, 
But sincerly from your heart,
Money and God - two different things,
Try so keep them apart

What a contradiction of all they claim to be.
How the fuck can your hard earned cash grant you a life in eternity?

This is not true religion...
This is a religous fraud!
Don't think contibuting your money,
Will bring you closer to God.

I conclude this religion
Should be from your inner self,
Don't waste all of your bucks,
Keep them for yourself!
