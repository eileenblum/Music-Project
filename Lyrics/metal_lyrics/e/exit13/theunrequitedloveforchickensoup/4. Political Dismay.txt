Our government leaders make hundreds of mistakes,
Their promises to the country are blatantly fake,
They fuck with other countries where we don't belong.
The way our system is run seems to me absolutely wrong.

Voting for who? The one with more money?
Their election campaigns strike me as funny...

I'm politically dismayed [4x]

Our government leaders should listen to the people's voice
Let society have some say in a political choice
Deny infiltrating countries who don't want us there,
And stop taking our money for defense which is not fair!

Our taxes go. Where? Nuclear arms?
These are the faces that will bring the world harm...

I'm politically dismayed [4x]
