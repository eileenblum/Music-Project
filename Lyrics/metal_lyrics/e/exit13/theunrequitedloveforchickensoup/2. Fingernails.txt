Fingernails subside between my teeth,
To help me cope with stress and grief 

My fingernails could use some salt!
Yet this calcium treat won't come to a halt.

I've chewed my fingers red and sore,
Now I'm jonsin' and need some more.

An ounce of fingernails would be looking good, 
I'd chew on yours if I could!!!
