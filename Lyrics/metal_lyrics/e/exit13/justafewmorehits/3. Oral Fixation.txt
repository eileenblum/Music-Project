I've got this beautiful lover who's got a special friend
that I can only talk to when we're alone in bed
This friend gets so excited when deliclitly (sic) rubbed
and fills my precious baby with the feelings that she's loved

I really do adore this friend who's always on my mind
My lover says I'm obsessed but that she doesn't mind
I sensuously caress my lover's tender skin
I press my mouth against her warmth and eagerly begin

I apply direct pressure to her secret spot
and plunge my tongue into her love so fragrant, wet and hot
My baby's feeling energized, emotionally high
Sometimes it's better to give than receive, I willingly oblige

My hair becomes dishevelled as I make love orally
What a rush of satisfaction to administer ecstacy
Unsuppressible mewing gasps escape from her lips
as tingling torrents of pleasure race through her undulating hips

Her body is now writhing and going into spasms
Her back is arched, her eyes roll back, it's time for her orgasm
