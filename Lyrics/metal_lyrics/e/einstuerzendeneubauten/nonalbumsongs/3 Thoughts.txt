first,
I thought:
the advent of the iron age
made the elongation of the male sex
unavoidable
and its main aim
the penetration
the knife, the sword, the spear
second,
I thought:
gunpowder, firearms
the main aim shifted
to ejaculation
and - bombs:
the mystification of the orgasm
third,
I think:
simulation
through screen or helmet
makes this
pornography
