["Sonnenallee: Es war einmal im Osten..." soundtrack]There's a labyrinth
But it has no walls
There are no exit signs
No arrows, no red lights

And there is you and me
Goes without saying

La dee la da da da
La dee la da da da

Where would you go without me?

We have to make decisions
Before it gets too dark
The sunset is behind us
We're facing terra incognita
It's so hard to make decisions
In a labyrinth without walls

La dee la da da da da
La dee la da da da da

But where would you go without me?

Make up your mind
By chance or intuition
You can't just turn around
Stand motionless and wait
I could follow you
Or you could follow me

In this labyrinth
Without its walls
Where no ways are clearly marked
We find our troubled paths
'We' is you and me
Goes without saying

La dee la da da da
La dee la da da da

And where would you go without me?
