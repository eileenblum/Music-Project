["Sonnenallee: Es war einmal im Osten..." soundtrack]If she comes close I beg defeat
Bows and triggers waste a beat
Systole and diastole
All together, off control

A drastic loss of reality
Do not operate machinery
She radiates, I disintegrate
These symptoms mean it is too late

Just see
What love does to me

Just see
What love does to me

Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever it does to me
Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever it does

Hypersensibility
Closed insensibility
Insomnia and dizziness
If she appears I am a mess
If side effects occur it's all too late
If side effects occur it's all too late

Skin irritations, itchiness
I'm about to lose my consciousness
My case, I think, is quite advanced
If she comes near I slip in trance

Just see
What love does to me

Every single one
The atoms, they spin their charge
In circles
