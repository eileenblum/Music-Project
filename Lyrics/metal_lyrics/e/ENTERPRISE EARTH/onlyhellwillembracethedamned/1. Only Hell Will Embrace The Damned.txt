I'm just a man trying to survive in the midst of a wasteland
Chased by the dead faces of everyone that
I have ever loved
This is the end yet
I still can't let you go
Something inside of me keeps pushing me to stay alive
Haunting me
Forcing me to survive
I have nothing else to live for
I only hope to see the next bloodred sunrise
Inhabitable wasteland
Desolate and forgotten
Withering away in the palm of my hand
Only hell will embrace the damned

Burn
Terraform
A dead world will burn
Creating an atmosphere of endless despair
Terraform
A dead world will burn
Suffering
Shrouded in darkness
Hell
Fire is born
Burn
Imminent yet ever so clear
The beauty of death
The instinct of fear
Emmanating from the fumes of boiling blood
I embrace my conviction

I'm just a man trying to survive in the midst of a wasteland
Chased by the dead faces of everyone that
I have ever loved
This is the end yet
I still can't let you go
Something inside of me keeps pushing me to stay alive
Haunting me
Forcing me to survive
I have nothing else to live for
I only hope to see the next bloodred sunrise
Inhabitable wasteland
Desolate and forgotten
Withering away in the palm of my hand
Only hell will embrace the damned

I can only blame myself for what
I have become
I can never be forgiven
I t can never be undone
All that's left of you are memories
I have to watch you die on repeat in my reveries
All this time
I ran away from the pain
It's like a beast in the woods and
I'm it's helpless prey
Only hell will embrace the damned

We are the forsaken
Only hell will embrace the damned
We are the forsaken
