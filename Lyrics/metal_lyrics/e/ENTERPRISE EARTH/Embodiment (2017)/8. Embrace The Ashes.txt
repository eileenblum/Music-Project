I want to change the world
but I can't trapped in the body of a man.
I can't expect seven billion corpses to understand.
There's nothing left for me here.
Embrace the ashes of what you hold dear.
Everyone that I've ever loved turned to ravenous creatures.
Starving, hungry for blood.
They betrayed me in the end.
A Judas kiss placed on my cheek by my friends.
They were in it for themselves.
That's what makes this world a fucking hell.
The flames illuminate in the night,
burning ever so bright.
Embrace the ashes of what you hold dear.
