Father, forgive them
They know not what they do
If I told you I don't want revenge
This wouldn't be true
As I hang from my cross
I see the hate in their eyes
These children are lost
Abort the bastards
Ignore their cries
There is no hope for a world inhabited by humanity
They rule with insanity
They are a plague wasting away
At our integrity of this sacred Earth
Father of abortion, destroy this perversion
Erase what you have conceived
This is the world that I perceive
Father, forgive them
They know not what they do
If I told you I don't want revenge
This wouldn't be true
Smite them, invite them to hang on the cross
With me beneath the blackened sky
Ignore their desperate cries
Father of abortion destroy this perversion
Erase what you have conceived
This is what I perceive
You gave birth to a mistake
You breathed into their lungs
And they mocked you with their deceitful tongues
Creation
Abort this debauched creation
