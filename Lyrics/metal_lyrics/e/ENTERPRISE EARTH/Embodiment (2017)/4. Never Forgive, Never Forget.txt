I've been living with the guilt for so long.
I lost you. What went wrong?
If I would of done something different,
maybe you'd still be here, but I didn't.
Never forgive, never forget.
I live with the guilt. I live with the pain.
Life will never be the same without you.
I'm trying not to lose hope. I'm still trying to cope.
Maybe if I would have done something different,
you wouldn't be dead, but you are.
I wish it could have taken me instead.
I'm alive and I live with the pain every single day.
I can never forgive myself.
Every day without you is fucking hell.
Never forgive, never forget.
When I think of you, I think of you as you are.
Maggots eating away at your flesh.
When I put my ear to your lips there was no breath.
You've been taken from me, taken by death.
Never forgive, never forget.
