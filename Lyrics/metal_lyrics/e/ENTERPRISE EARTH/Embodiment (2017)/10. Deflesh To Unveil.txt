Beneath my skin.
I feel the hatred that burns within.
Everything that I've ever loved has been taken from me again.
I can never forgive this world.
Not until it gives me what I am owed.
I walk through this world alone.
Scars so deep they run straight to the bone.
This flesh is weak. Serrated teeth cut through my skin to see what's underneath.
Unleash the hatred. I won't let this life be wasted.
Sitting back while the world crushes me under it's weight.
Letting the fear I have control my destiny.
I won't the victim. I won't be the coward.
I won't hesitate to destroy you in my final hour.
I'm sick o bearing the weight on my shoulders,
waiting for something to change.
To no avail, it always remains the same.
I am the only one I can blame.
I am the only one who can change.
I won't be the victim. I won't be the coward.
I won't hesitate to destroy you in my final hour.
I won't hesitate to destroy you in my final hour.
This earth belongs to me.
Nothing can stop me.
Decay and erosion.
I am the omen.
