Sadistic infatuation.
Too hard to resist temptation.
It makes me feel alive.
Without the pain I feel deprived.

My flesh is weak.
Cursing your name through my broken teeth.
Everything that you stand for makes me sick to my stomach.
I tilt my head back and swallow the vomit.
Your pathetic lies shine through your eyes.
Mesmerized like a piece of shit that attracts the flies.

I let you in.
You're so close I couldn't live without you.
The pain is pure, the pain is true.
You were always there even when the world turned it's back on me.

Sadistic infatuation.
Too hard to resist temptation.
It makes me feel alive.
Without the pain I feel deprived.

It makes me feel alive.
I can see my reflection in your watery eyes.
I can see what I am by the way you agonize.
I'll always be your piece of shit no matter how hard I fucking try.

I will always be your piece of shit.

I've been itching to let the animal out. Lose control.
He's been watching through the eye holes of the portrait on the wall.
I am him, he is me.
Without each other what would I be?

Sadistic infatuation.
Too hard to resist temptation.
It makes me feel alive.
Without the pain I feel deprived.
