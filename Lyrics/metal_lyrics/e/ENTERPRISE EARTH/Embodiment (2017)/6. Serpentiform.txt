The moonlight creeps through the window,
slithering up the sheets like a serpent.
Illuminating the scars and the wounds,
reminding me that death is coming soon.
This flesh is weak. I collapse at the serpent's feet.
Transcending mortality. Materializing in front of me.
Composing a vision of death.
When I ascend from the depths of my flesh.
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
I will transcend through the barrier.
I will be the bringer of hysteria.
I've come to terms with my death.
I'll be leaving this world in a body bag.
No one will ever remember my name.
Everything I've built will collapse in the end.
No one will ever remember my name.
