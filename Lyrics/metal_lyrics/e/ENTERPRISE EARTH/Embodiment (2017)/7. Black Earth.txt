In this world your beliefs are what plague you all
Kill each other until one is left, the rest will fall
Until the unbelievers are dead these rivers will always run red

War
Never ending war
Exterminate to eradicate
You must think alike
Carbon copies of one another
Kill each other
I live in a cesspool
The divergent hide
The self-righteous rule

I live in a cesspool
Cold-hearted
Full of fear and lethargic
Sedate me
Shove it down my throat
Fill my lungs until I choke
Is this what you want me to be?
Hands tied behind my back
Obedience is what I always lacked
If I don't give in,
If I don't comply
They'll shit me out like the rest
Sentenced to die
Sedate me
