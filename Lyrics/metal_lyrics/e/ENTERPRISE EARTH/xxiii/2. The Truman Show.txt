I am the architect
I have designed the labyrinth in which you wander
the all-seeing eye
within the shadow of a timeless lie
you won't believe what you cannot see yet you believe so strongly in what you are told
by darkness the world is controlled and darkness will enfold
you were born into bondage a slave paying homage
the walls around you were thought to protect you
they were constructed to keep you locked away forever
regurgitated hymns of the damned perpetuate the illusion of reality
distorting everything that you perceive
my kingdom spreads
a thriving infection
welcome to the illusion
the mass deception
you won't believe what you cannot see yet you believe so strongly in what you are told
by darkness the world is controlled and darkness will enfold
I am the architect
the tempting serpent that offers the world the tree of life
the all-seeing eye observing you from the shadows
you accept the version of reality in which it's presented
I present you deceit
I am the shepherd and you are my sheep
