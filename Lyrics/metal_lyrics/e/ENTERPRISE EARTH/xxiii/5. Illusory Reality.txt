I'm awake now
everything that I've ever known is a lie
the walls around me are collapsing in this illusory reality
it's all in my head
a synthetic depiction reflects into my retina
rushing to my optic nerve
I've been lied to since I was born
all along I've been unaware of my cell
pacing from wall to wall assuming that I'm free
I was never free
bound by the limitations of solidity
I was never free
my prison walls reflect a false reality
trapped in an induced reverie
wires burrow beneath my cold skin
pulsing within
I'm awake now
everything that I've ever known is a lie
the walls around me are collapsing in this illusory reality
I release myself from this world
I remove the umbilical chord from the base of my skull
the illusions subside revealing life as a product of our collective consciousness
life is what we make it
I open my eyes to true reality
we are no longer born we are grown and harvested
