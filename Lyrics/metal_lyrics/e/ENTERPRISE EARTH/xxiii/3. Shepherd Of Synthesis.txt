This holy day we immolate the blood of our sheep
a sacrifice to the bearer of light
to pave the way towards a future of illumination
an orchestration of human sacrifice
the death throes spark an enigma that emerges from the dark
the boiled blood evaporates then emits into the sky
conjuring a beast from a vortex in the fabric of space and time
a portal forms in the sky over the burning towers of man
the beast looks down
the catastrophe and the blood between his teeth are the proof that the beast is pleased
now the masses fall to their knees in awe of its majesty
the great fallacy
bleeding eyes act as the witnesses
behold the shepherd of synthesis
bleeding eyes act as the witnesses
behold the shepherd of synthesis
This holy day we immolate the blood of our sheep
a sacrifice to the bearer of light
to pave the way towards a future of illumination
an orchestration of human sacrifice
the death throes spark an enigma that emerges from the dark
the boiled blood evaporates then emits into the sky
conjuring a beast from a vortex in the fabric of space and time
embered flesh drifts away in blackened columns of smoke
and the sheep choke in awe of its majesty
the great fallacy
out of the chaos unearths a new life of despair and misery
