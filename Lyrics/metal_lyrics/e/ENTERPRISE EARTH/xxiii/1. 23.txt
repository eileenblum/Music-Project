you're dead and the silence is haunting me
the room is cold and I am trembling
there's no going back now
I can't take it back now
you're dead
your lifeless gaze points towards the ceiling
with my blood soaked hands I reach down and I close your eyes
I drag you to the cellar
and your skull smashes on every step down
it's too late to regret now
chains hanging in a tub
suspend you from above
your open veins drain into the grating
your complexion grows pale and the air turns stale
I slip on the blood trail
I slip on the blood trail
the rusted faucet begins to rinse your crimson skin
I made a deal with the devil
the one within
your life is an offering
