[feat. Orion of In Dying Arms]Standing in the rain, pushing through the crowd. Watching them scrape up pieces of your brain.
A world without you will never be the same. You left the pain behind.
Memories of you playing in my mind. Your body will rot.
Pretending you're asleep beneath the earth, buried in a pretty box as if your corpse had any worth.
They call it the cowardâs way out, I call it courage.
Lifting up the sheet for the coroner, I can't recognize you anymore.
But I still think that you're gorgeous, I still think that you're gorgeous.
Your reconstructed face. Pity, such beauty went to a putrid waste.
The smell of death fuming from your rotting mouth.
The tracks of stitches running underneath your blouse.
I hope that you're watching this as I give you one last kiss farewell, weâll meet again in hell.
No matter how deep you fall, I will hear your call. Nothing can stand between us nothing at all.
Burning slowly forever, at least we're together, hold my hand and close your eyes.
Don't be afraid, everyone dies, your body will rot.
Pretending you're asleep beneath the earth, buried in a pretty box as if your corpse had any worth.
They call it the cowardâs way out, I call it courage.

[Orion]:
I still think you're gorgeous, the amber flames lick your tortured face. Our bodies melt.
I still think you're gorgeous, the amber flames lick your tortured face.
Our bodies melt, and then interlace.
