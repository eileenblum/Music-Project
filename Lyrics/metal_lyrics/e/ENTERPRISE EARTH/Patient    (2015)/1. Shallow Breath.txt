I've been watching your progress
You wouldn't know because I'm on the other side of the mirror
Observing you as you paint your reflection

Have you ever felt my touch as you sleep?
Or hear the sound of my footsteps as the floorboards creek?
Do you feel alone or do you feel like something is there?
It wasn't the wind that caressed your hair

You can lie to yourself but you can't lie to me
As I look through the glass all your thoughts can be seen
When you bow your head at night &amp; bleed into a prayer
I am the only one who can hear
So close yet so far

I've been watching your progress
You wouldn't know because I'm on the other side of the mirror
Observing you as you paint your reflection

You can lie to yourself but you can't lie to me
As I look through the glass all your thoughts can be seen
When you bow your head at night &amp; bleed into a prayer
I am the only one who can hear
You are not alone

Hold your breath on the way down
With every shallow breath you begin to drown
Swallow the blood, swim for air [2x]
