I kneel by the bedside and bow my head, murmuring a prayer in dread.
Either there is no god or god is dead, was this all part of the plan?
To leave me here, amid the vultures? Picking out the eyes of a broken man?
They think they're better than me, so afraid of heresy.
Eradicating every divergent strand until they come together and make a stand.
We stand on the earth divided, we cannot resist, we cannot fight it.
Guided by the light of desire. We cannot resist, we cannot fight it.
The vultures perch on my chest, tearing my flesh, using my bones to make a nest.
They think that they follow a leader, on their knees, sucking the dick of the reaper.
Feeding them lies as he shoots his load into their eyes.
Theyâre always begging for more, slurping up the cum like worthless whores.
Guided by the light of desire, fearing the kiss of a corrosive fire.
Rip out my tainted eyes, feed upon my skin.
Regurgitate my flesh into your children's mouths, regurgitate my flesh.
I'm the food for the new generation, the new generation.
