I peer through your eyes, wearing your flesh as a disguise. You can see too.
You witness your life rotting through and through.
Everyone around you sees you for what you appear to be.
They don't see what lies beneath, they don't see me.
I peer through your eyes, wearing your flesh as a disguise. You can see too.
You witness your life rotting through and through, I am the demon that lives inside you.
I'm feeding on you, devouring every aspect of your life. Hell.
I'm fucking your wife, I'm fucking your wife as you cry in the corner.
You wonât exist much longer. Losing control, trapped in your head.
Take your pills and tuck yourself into bed.
When the time is right I will spread my blackened wings.
The flies swarm into the room, licking the cuts, healing the wounds.
When I am strong enough I won't need you, I won't need you.
I'll grind you up so the pigs can eat you.
