[feat. Adam Warren of Oceano]I can hear them breathing
Snarling in my ear
They are guiding my hand as I press the scalpel against your skin

I drag the blade down your chest
A perfect incision between your breasts

I stretched out the skin
Then begin to separate
Your ribs with a hacksaw

The amorphic creature lurk in the shadows
Watching my every move
Silhouettes portraying the gallows
Flickering in fluorescent lights

Amorphic entities
Creatures of darkness
Reaching out from another dimension
Probing deeper into the physical realm

I can hear them breathing
Snarling in my ear
They are guiding my hand as I turn the key
Unlocking a gateway to Hell [2x]

Unholy glyphs burn deep in your forehead
Completing a sacred crest
Blackened shadows pierce you like arrows
Filling the void in your severed chest

Stitch by stitch
I sew up the wound
Containing the darkness
That dwells within

[Adam]
Unworldly we are true Gods restrained to covet the human flesh
Fear my touch [2x]
Sense my presence

Relapse in obedience
Allow me to molest your psyche
Penetrating this shallow womb called a body
Embedded we are now one [2x]
Embedded we are
