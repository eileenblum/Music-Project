[feat. Dickie Allen of Abiotic]A porcelain replica, a manufactured mask plastered on your hollow skull.
There's nothing left anymore, replicating at a rapid rate. Herding together at your masters feet.
Licking the crumbs off the floor, worshiping the porcelain whore.
You perceive the world as it's played out to be, a preconceived showcase of reality.
Hypnotized by the lies that drown out the truth, parents still think that they're raising the youth.
Mesmerized by the flies digesting decay, consuming the light of day.
You will never be beautiful, you will never be beautiful to me. What a disgrace.
They perceive the world as it's played out to be, a preconceived showcase of reality.
Worship the porcelain whore, rotting and spreading like spores, sending the children into wars.
Hypnotized by the lies that drown out the truth, parents still think that they're raising the youth.
Mesmerized by the flies digesting decay, consuming the light of day.

[Dickie]:
Bow before me, the bellowing beast. Arise and worship, I the porcelain whore.
Your artificial idol in this materialistic society.
A nation of confusion, overwhelmed in narcissistic decomposition.
