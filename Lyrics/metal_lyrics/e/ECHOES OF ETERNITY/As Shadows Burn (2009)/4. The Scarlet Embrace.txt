Reveal yourself to me
Reveal yourself to me

Unleash all your desires
Release your inner fires

Beneath your scarlet robe
What pain will pleasures hold
On paths that lovers strode
Between the crimson folds

Reveal yourself to me
What visions will be seen
Inside burning manic dreams
And chaotic crimson screams

Unleash all your desires
Release your inner fires

Your taste is what I crave
Your scent makes me anticipate
I'll hunt you like my prey
I long for your scarlet embrace

Reveal yourself to me
What visions will be seen
Inside burning manic dreams
And chaotic crimson screams
