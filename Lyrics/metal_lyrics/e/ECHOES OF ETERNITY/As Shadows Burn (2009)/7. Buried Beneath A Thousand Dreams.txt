A gift of freedom to the caged
And the gold that couldn't stay
Spirit chains of jealous rage, concealed
Hearts are strewn across the floor
From a love that is no more
Ship of dreams has left the shore

And empty heart, an empty soul
I fall apart, I'm all alone

Buried beneath a thousand dreams
Buried beneath a thousand dreams

Lonely mornings turn to day,
Turn to evenings filled with pain
Will I ever be the same again
As my silent heart awakes,
From the ashes I'm remade
I start to pull out the stake

It's time to live, not time to mourn
I will resist, I am reborn

Buried beneath a thousand dreams
Buried beneath a thousand dreams
Buried beneath a thousand dreams
Buried beneath a thousand dreams
