As darkness falls, daylight dies
And I hear the call of the night
A moonless sky above me
I come alive like twilight fire

I slither like the shadows
Whisper madness, feel no pain

Nocturnal serenade
In the darkness I reign

Innocence sleeps, demons dance
A veil for the thief, witches chant
Ideas disguised as a dream
I come alive like twilight fire

I slither like the shadows
Whisper madness, feel no pain

Nocturnal serenade
In the darkness I reign
