If we are eternal souls
Why should we fear death
Beings of eternity
Expressed in the flesh
From dust we are born
To dust we regress
Souls of infinity
Expressed in the flesh
Source of all creation
Within your spirit lies
Sings an eternal song
A hymn that never dies
Not created nor destroyed
The end is not the end
When you leave this mortal form
Life begins again
Life begins again, the end is not the end
Life begins again, the end is not the end
Life begins again, the end is not the end
Again!
Source of all creation
Within your spirit lies
Sings an eternal song
A hymn that never dies
