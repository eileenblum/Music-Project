Stand with me, and watch the stars dance across the night
We will steal the sun from its march across the sky
Stand with me, where the monuments will lie
We will build a monument that stands the test of time
Capture the sunlight's first rays
Honor the shortest of days
Stand before Circles in Stone
Stand with me before the Temple of the Sun
When dawn awakes with a kiss across the sky
With hearts of wonder and devotion in our eyes
We will speak the words that give eternal life
Capture the sunlight's first rays
Honor the shortest of days
Stand before Circles in Stone
Capture the sunlight's first rays
Honor the shortest of days
Stand before Circles in Stone
