Beyond Bombay high on Malabar Hill
In a lush garden lie the secrets unrevealed
Once death has fed its hungry...
And now the sun takes back the life it gave
An ancient race that has no ashes, not a trace
Five and one rest here, an eternal reunion
Once death has fed its hungry...
And now the sun takes back the life it gave
