I wandered through the forest blind
The Golden Land I searched so hard to find
Lay in ruins beneath the soul I left so far behind
Lost somewhere within the sands of time
I found comfort in your truth
Solace in your words
The kingdom we seek lies within
I found comfort in your truth
Solace in your words
The kingdom we seek lies within
I could feel your warmth and light
When cold and darkness filled the sky
Your words became a shining path that led me through the night
"The land you seek has always been, it lies within"
I found comfort in your truth
Solace in your words
The kingdom we seek lies within
I found comfort in your truth
Solace in your words
The kingdom we seek lies within
I found comfort in your truth
Solace in your words
The kingdom we seek lies within
I found comfort in your truth
Solace in your words
The kingdom we seek lies within
