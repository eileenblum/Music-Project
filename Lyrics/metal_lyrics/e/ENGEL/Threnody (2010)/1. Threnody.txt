Looking back at what I have done
Breathing heavy I think I am gone
I cannot breathe, I cannot see any more
Why am I still standing here?
The life in me is on the run
I cannon breathe, I cannot see any more

Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around

Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around
the pain has left in me
This is a song for the dead

Tears are falling for the young
All around I see them run
I cannot breathe, I cannot see anymore
Anger, pain and misery
That is all I have in me
I feel the need; this is it
A threnody

Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around

Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around
the pain has left in me
This is it - a threnody
Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around
The pain has left in me
This is a song for the dead

She was broken
Not defeated
Rotten sickness
Took her life

Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around
The pain has left in me
This is it - a threnody
Everyone I've missed
Walking dead around
The pain has left in me
This is a song for the dead
