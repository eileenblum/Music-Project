You can try to break me, but i won't give up
I got the feeling of unity and that will keep me up
When we stand united the rules belong to us
This fight is here for you and me and for those who will resist

Come and see what's on the other side
This is something for the brave of mind

So, don't just stand there!
Come on and raise resist

Come and see what's on the other side
This is something for the brave of mind

Give the others one to think about
This is how we make the evening rise
