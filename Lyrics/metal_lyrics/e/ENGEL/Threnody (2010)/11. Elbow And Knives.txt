You tried to run away
From future marks in life
But you're not fast enough
To get away from us
You've got to prepare for the fight of your lives
'Cause we are going in, with elbows and knives
Why do you stay in hate?
When the opposite is closing in
Not wondering how things would be
Just let it embrace
I wonder how you feel inside, running away
I wonder how you'd feel inside, if you'd just stay
You tried to run away
From future marks in life
But you're not fast enough
To get away from us
You've got to prepare for the fight of your lives
'Cause we are going in, with elbows and knives
I wonder how you feel inside, running away
I wonder how you'd feel inside, if you'd just stay
Going in, for the kill
