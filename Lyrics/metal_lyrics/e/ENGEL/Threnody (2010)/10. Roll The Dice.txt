Every time you stare at me, you need to step aside
You've got to run another way and just leave me be
You still act so very strange
You made it to yourself
You need to find someone else to point your finger at
I'm feeling strong, I'm feeling fine
And I will try to stay this way
So realize you've got to roll the dice
And choose another game
Stand me closer to the fire
Leave me burning in these flames
You've got to go and find another
Leave me here so I can burn
Look inside and then you will find where the problem lies
Stop dragging me in misery
I won't go down like that
I am walking tall and still I will keep my head up high
So you can try to break my pride
But be prepared to fail
I'm feeling strong
I'm feeling fine
And I will try to stay this way
So realize you've got to roll the dice
And choose another game
Stand me closer to the fire
Leave me burning in these flames
You've got to go and find another
Leave me here so I can burn
