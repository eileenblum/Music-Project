We never thought that we were going down
Things just started falling
No straws to grip, no path to run
We were getting stuck

When we saw an opening we started to run
Took that chance to get away
No straws to grip, no path to run
We were getting stuck

'Til the skies are dry as dust
The great forever losing touch
This will have to last, last forever

'Til we drown in loneliness
Awaiting our deliverance
This will have to last, last forever
(Until eternity ends!)

Nothing's gonna change
You know it stays the same
You know they are telling us
You've got to fall in line
To see the real true crime

You know they are killing us
We are running away, further away
So that we might make it
Every time they say
Nothing's gonna change

You know they are killing us

'Til the skies are dry as dust
The great forever losing touch
This will have to last, last forever

'Til we drown in loneliness
Awaiting our deliverance
This will have to last, last forever
(Until eternity ends!)
