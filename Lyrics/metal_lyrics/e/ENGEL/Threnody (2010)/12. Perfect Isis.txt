I know secrets about you, that's true, I do
I know something about you, you know, I do
Darkness, laughter and heartache, that's what we see
Can't stop thinking about you but now I am free

Don't wanna build on something old
Something crumbled, something gold
I can't just throw away these feelings
But what has been is not to come once again

I will never forget you, you know that's true
I will never regret you, it's true for you too
Fading pictures of lovers, it's all in me
You and I was too perfect to match in life

Don't wanna build on something old
Something crumbled, something gold
I can't just throw away these feelings
But what has been is not to come once again

Don't wanna build on something old
Something crumbled, something gold
I can't just throw away these feelings
But what has been is not to come once again
