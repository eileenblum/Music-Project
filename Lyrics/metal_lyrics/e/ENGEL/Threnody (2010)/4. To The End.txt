She is dressed in black, but still she shine
That light is coming here, it's fire in my eyes
There is a distance here, I can't erase
Why can't you see that I am here to make it real?

Say what you will, I'll come to the end for you
Lead me away; I'll change the whole world
I stand on my knees, giving my heart to you
Show me the way; I'll change the whole world

Her head is resting upon my lap
The eyes are closed and I'm just staring at her face
I try to speak, let the wind stroke her hair
I want to tell her but I don't know what to say

Say what you will, I'll come to the end for you
Lead me away; I'll change the whole world
I stand on my knees, giving my heart to you
Show me the way; I'll change the whole world
(Just for you)
