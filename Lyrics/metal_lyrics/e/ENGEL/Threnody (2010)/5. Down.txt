Big boxes of hurt is coming closer
One is just for me
Wears down my soul into nothing
Got to make a fist
Tried to reach myself and find the true me
It doesn't work - I'm going down...down...down

I'm screaming empty words
I'm building bigger walls
I'm trying to be more
Oh - got to break my...

Break my walls

Dig down deep into the darkness
It's a long hard walk
To see the truth and get the feelings inside
I'll show you fear

Feelings inside
Feed me the fear
Feelings inside
Make me see

I'm screaming empty words
I'm building bigger walls
I'm trying to be more
Oh - got to break my...

Break my walls
