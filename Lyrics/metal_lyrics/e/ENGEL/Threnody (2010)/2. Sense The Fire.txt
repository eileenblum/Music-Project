Never think that you and I
Would come to this together
Wherever we go, wherever we look
It's always at the same things
You're the backup for me
I could never believe
The misery is mutual
What do we do to deserve
But the treasures ain't heard
But I always looking forward

(Oh) You and me fight together
Scream together
(Ah) I think I feel the power
Sense the fire!

The distance is cold
Our pleasures got old
The darkness is all over
You scrabble my world
When you shiver my spine
You left me one immortal

(Oh) You and me fight together
Scream together
(Ah) I think I feel the power
Sense the fire!

[Solo]

(Oh) You and me fight together
Scream together
(Ah) I think I feel the power
Sense the fire

(Oh) You and me fight together
Scream together
(Ah) I think you feel the power
Sense the fire!
