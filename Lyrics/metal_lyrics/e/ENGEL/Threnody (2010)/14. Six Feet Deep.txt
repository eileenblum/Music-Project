[Europe &amp; US Bonus Track]

Take me in and let me show you how it works
I've got something on my mind for you to choke on
Every time she saw a chance to improve, someone pulled the rug and laughed as
she was falling

A girl so strong, she made me start believing

Who are they to judge her?
You know they misunderstood
Who are they to judge her?
She was misunderstood

Take me in and let me show
I got something for you, to choke on
Now she's gone, six feet deep
She's in my head and i will never forget her!

A girl so strong, she made me start believing

Who are they to judge her?
You know they misunderstood
Who are they to judge her?
She was misunderstood

She helped me to see the world, in a different way

Who are they to judge her?
You know they misunderstood
Who are they to judge her?
She was misunderstood
