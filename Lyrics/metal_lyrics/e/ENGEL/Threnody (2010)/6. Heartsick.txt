I see your smile from across the room
I see that you're waiting for someone
I want to be that one standing next to you
But you're holding the hand of another

I want to be the one
To call when tears are falling down
To seek when the heart is crumbling down
I want to be the one for you
I am falling

I never will give you up
I will fight to the end to get you

I want to be the one
To call when tears are falling down
To seek when the heart is crumbling down
I want to be the one for you
I am falling (for you)

So will you listen to me?
I want to feel you now

I want to be the one
To call when tears are falling down
To seek when the heart is crumbling down
I want to be the one for you
I am falling
