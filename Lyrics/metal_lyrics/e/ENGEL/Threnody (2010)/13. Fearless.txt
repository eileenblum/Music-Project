[Japanese Bonus Track]

So did you hear
You're no longer welcome here
So did you hear
If you come I'll show you fear
You know what you have done
The deed is done...
So now you know that you're not welcome here anymore
I'm throwing out my fear
You're the first out from my soul
Right now I'm getting clean
I'm back in my fearless home
Just stay away
My nightmare hand will crush your fate
You know what you have done
The deed is done...
So now you know that you're not welcome here anymore
I'm throwing out my fear
You're the first out from my soul
Right now I'm getting clean
I'm back in my fearless home
