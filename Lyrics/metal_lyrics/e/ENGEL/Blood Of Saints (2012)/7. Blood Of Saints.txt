[Music: Egnelin, Lyrics: Klavborn, Engelin]

You are the ones who bring us Here...
The reason of it All!
Unite the World and spread the Word.
That all of us are Saints!

One is weaks...
We are Strong and we get stronger by the night.
so come on in and unite with us,
and let your voice be heard!

We are here Forever...
Because the Blood of Saints!
We unite the World...
We are the Blood of Saints!

Pump that fist and join the Cause
together we will rule the world!
Big of Small, Boy or Girl... We welcome everyone!

We are here Forever... [?]
Because the Blood of Saints! [?]
We unite the World... [?]
We are the Blood of Saints! [?]
