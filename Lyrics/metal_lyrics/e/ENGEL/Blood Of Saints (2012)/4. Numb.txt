[Music: Engelin, Olausson, Sunesson, Lyrics: Klavborn]

I'll be the one to tell you
I'll bring the truth.
Stop trusting all they tell you
they get paid from Booze.

You have to stop
These Lies you feed us.
Their Evils ruling and
their greed guiding Them.

They puke out lies on TV
to make You numb.
The thing that scares them most
is When you start to Think.

Afraid of what will happen
If we use the Earth.
Take away the ban on Natue
will take us home

You have to stop
These Lies you feed us.
Their Evils ruling and
their greed guiding Them.
