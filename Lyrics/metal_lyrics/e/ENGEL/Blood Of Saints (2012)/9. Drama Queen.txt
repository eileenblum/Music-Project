[Music: Engelin, Hjelm, Lyrics: Klavborn]

Through the door she walked right In,
High-heels and bloodred Lips.
Nails too long and skirt to Short.
Attention craving and nothing More.

Look at this, now he is Here.
Lots of ink the look is Rough.
Muscle-bound weak in mind.
A true bitch that sleeps Alone.

Try to look at whats within You,
Or is that something that you're scared Of?

No one needs a bitch like You,
A Drama Queen covered in Blue.
Choose your friends by their Looks.
A true bitch that sleeps Alone.

They loose their mind to look the Part.
Degrade yourself when the price is Right,
So all can see that you look Alright.
No one needs a Bitch like you.

There is only one thing left to do Then.
this is now, you got the face of Fears.
