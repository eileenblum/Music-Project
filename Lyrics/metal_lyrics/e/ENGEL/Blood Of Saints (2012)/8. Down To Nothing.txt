[Music: Engelin, Lyrics: Klavborn]

Straight from the Street
They state their Plee
With a guilty Smile
I just want them to Bleed.

I witness the decline of Humanity.
Salvation running from this World.
Mindless action is all we Breed,
Dragging us down, down to Nothing.

With broken hopes and broken Lives
The end is not near, it's already Here.

thinking only of Number 1,
That's the way we are taught to Be.
Kill the beauty, bring me Death
Dragging us down into Nothing.

With broken hopes and broken Lives
The end is not near, it's already Here.
