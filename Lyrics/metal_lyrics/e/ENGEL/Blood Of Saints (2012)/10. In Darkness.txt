[feat. Bellmans Drengar][Music: Engelin, Lyrics: Klavborn]

Don't be so Narrow-minded so biased and Small.
You're missing out on a whole brave new World
It's not that far, it's just outside your personal Wall.
Tear down your blindfold so you will see the Reality.

Spread your wings and ride the Rainbow.
Open your mind and you'll see so much More.
The darkness inside will drag you down, So
Spread your wings and ride the Rainbow

You've got to be proud of what you feel Inside.
It doesn't matter if you show what make you Glow.
Be sure that someone got a four letter word for you.
Tear away your Blindfold and you will see the reality

Spread your wings and ride the Rainbow.
Open your mind and you'll see so much More.
The darkness inside will drag you down, So
Spread your wings and ride the Rainbow
