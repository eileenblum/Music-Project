[Music: Engelin, Hjelm, Lyrics: Klavborn]

I want to change, Don't want to Cry.
Something dwells in me tonight.
I want to throw it far Away.
How can I make it one more day?

I'm tired, weak and not in Use.
Helpless, poor and lazy Too.
I don't know just what to Do
The only thing that's good is You.

Nurse me to skeep.
And sing your Rhymes.
So I can Close my Eyes.
Kiss on the Cheek.
If I wake up I want to see your Smile.

All alone I'm weak and blue
You are the light inside my Soul.

You are the one that makes this Work.
Turns me around when I'm feeling Down.
All around, I'm going down.
The only thing that's good is you.

Nurse me to skeep.
And sing your Rhymes.
So I can Close my Eyes.
Kiss on the Cheek.
If I wake up I want to see your Smile.
