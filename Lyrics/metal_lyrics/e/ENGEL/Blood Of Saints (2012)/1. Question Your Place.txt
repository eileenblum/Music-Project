[Music: Engelin, Hjelm, Lyrics: Klavborn]

There is no need to cry. you just have to ask why?
There's Answers that they don't want to give you.

Break up in a smile, It's okay to go wild.
You don't have to stay in your line.

You can't see the Sun,
You're afraid to go out.
You don't dare to Question Your Place.

It's all up to you
to find out what to do.
There's Answers that they don't want to give you.

You can't see the Sun,
You're afraid to go out.
You don't dare to Question Your Place.

Like a Fish on the Land, Like a Birde in the sand.
Your content... With the place they gave you!

Break up in a smile, It's okay to go wild.
You don't have to stay in your line.

You can't see the Sun,
You're afraid to go out.
You don't dare to Question Your Place.
