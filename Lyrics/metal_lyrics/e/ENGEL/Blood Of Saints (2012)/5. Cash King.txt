[Music: Engelin, Lyrics: Klavborn]

The Lust of life just ran away.
Death seems to be the only Way.
Scared of what they do no Know.
Push me further down below.
Beware of retribution, All is fair in War!

I scream out my Anger for the Ones
Who Fuels this fire. I scream out my ...
Anger for the ones. Who runs this ride!

There is evil around Us.
They grab what they Can
It's fuel on my fire.
I'm breaking their Chains!

This is how they run this world
The value of man, counted in cash
Only one thing left to do and it's do or die for me

I scream out my Anger for the Ones
Who Fuels this fire. I scream out my ...
Anger for the ones. Who runs this ride!

There is evil around Us.
They grab what they Can
It's fuel on my fire.
I'm breaking their Chains!
