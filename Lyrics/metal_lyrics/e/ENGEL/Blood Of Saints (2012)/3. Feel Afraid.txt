[Music: Engelin, Lyrics: Klavborn]

Start from zero and push the paste.
Go out hard and don't look back.
Next in line, it might be you?
There's one more thing...
Never back down!

Leave me alone or pray
That all will go ok

Haters; Breakers and other fucks,
Stand in the way with Sticks and Rocks.
Beat the bully and pass them fucks
The best thing is to...
Never back down!

Leave me alone or pray
That all will go ok
And if you decide to stay?
You will feel afraid.
