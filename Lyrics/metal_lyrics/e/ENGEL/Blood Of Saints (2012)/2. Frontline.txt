[Music: Engelin, Lyrics: Klavborn]

I think it's ridiculous
that you still want to be oblivious.
It's such a comedy
that you don't want an autopsy.
Take the easy way
and live like you've never been told.
Better to know
than to blindly follow:

Look for me, I'll be here.
come with me
I'll show you what's been wrong here.
Here on the frontline!
I'll be here!

Laughed at, spat on and ridiculed,
That is the peasant's way
Work for you... Work for you!
Tell him how to think.
Believe the words, don't question at all.
Rise and Shine.
A new day just like yesterday

Look for me, I'll be here.
come with me
I'll show you what's been wrong here.
Here on the frontline!
I'll be here!
