Soaking The Earth With Wine From His Hands
Creating A New Nile With Blood And Stains

Devouring And Binding Your Crowd As The Snake
No Halos, Just Swords Splitting A Child In Half

Stand Aside
Will You Remit With Me The Witness Of Your Deceit?
Stand Aside, Let Them Adore
I'm Undivine Yet The Perfect Paraclete

Blinded You Hear Me Preaching
For End-Times - The New Times To Come
Blinded You Try To Reach Him
That New Day...

Forged From Pawns - Forged To Crowns
Gleaming For All In This Sulphur Rain

Stand Aside, Let Them Adore
I'm Undivine Yet The Perfect Paraclete

Blinded You Hear Me Preaching
For End-Times - The New Times To Come
Blinded You Try To Reach Him
That New Day...
