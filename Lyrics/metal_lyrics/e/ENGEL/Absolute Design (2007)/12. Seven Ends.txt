Open Up, Tell The Truth
Give Me 5 So We Can Seal That Deal
Show Me Teeth, Say Those Words
(And) Enjoy Your High That Comes With That Sin

Send A Rope So I Can Choose,
Send A Rope So I Can Do The Biggest Choice Of All

Write The Rules Now - The Book Needs Closure
Make The Deed And Write Eulogies
Can You Smell It? The Fear Is Closing
Coming Fast To Get A Hold Of You
And Drag You Down

Send A Rope So I Can Choose,
To Climb Or Tie A Noose
Send A Rope So I Can Do
The Biggest Choice Of All

Every Inch Of Me Is Blue
The Fire's Licking Me Through And Through
Seven Choices, Seven Ends
Licking The Clothes Straight From My Skin

Tell Some Lies, That Will Make Me Smile
Tell Me Why, I Need To Make Mistakes

Every Inch Of Me Is Blue
The Fire's Licking Me Through And Through
Seven Choices, Seven Ends
Licking The Clothes Straight From My Skin
