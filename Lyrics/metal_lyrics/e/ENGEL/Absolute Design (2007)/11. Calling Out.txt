I Never Realized That You're The One
That Will Teach Me To Be Dead
But You Never Understood That
I Will Twist Around Your Head
The Way I Live My Life I Know That
You Will Not Approve, But I Don't Give A Fuck
Because I Live Just The Way I Want To

Everytime I Close My Eyes I Hear Them Voices
Everytime I'm All Alone I See That Face

Calling Out So I'll Change My Ways
Working Hard To Turn Me In To Someone Else
They Don't See Why I Choose To Be Me
Trying Hard To End The Reason Of My Life

Now I Know Who The Fuck You Are
And What You Want To Do
You Think You Know The Truth About Me, But
That's Just Fucking Bull
Which One Of Us Do You Think Will Die
With A Big Fat Fucking Smile?
I Know I Will Do Because I
Lived Just The Way I Wanted To

Everytime I Close My Eyes I Hear Them Voices
Everytime I'm All Alone I See That Face

Calling Out So I'll Change My Ways
Working Hard To Turn Me In To Someone Else
They Don't See Why I Choose To Be Me
Trying Hard To End The Reason Of My Life
I'm Not Your Pain
I'm Not Your, No I'm Not Your Pain

Calling Out So I'll Change My Ways
Working Hard To Turn Me In To Someone Else
They Don't See Why I Choose To Be Me
Trying Hard To End The Reason Of My Life
