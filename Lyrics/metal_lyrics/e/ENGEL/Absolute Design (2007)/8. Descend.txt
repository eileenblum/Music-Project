Welcome In To My Burning World
Try To Stand And Feel The Pain

Can Never Deny Just Who I Am
Can Never Design Another Man
The Sulphur Is Raining On Me
I'm Bursting In Perfect Flames

I'm Falling, I'm Falling Down
To Far Down Below Where Mammon Is God
I'm Falling, I'm Falling Down
I Lie To Myself As My Ego Descends

Why Try To Exceed Your Own Design
Why Try To Be Everything In Time
I Got To Find My Place
Where Sulphur's Not Raining On Me

I'm Falling, I'm Falling Down
To Far Down Below Where Mammon Is God
I'm Falling, I'm Falling Down
I Lie To Myself As My Ego Descends
