With Sharpened Swords
To Last Man Standing
The Air Cathartic With Iron And Victory
This Static Show Of Force
Drenched In Paranoia
In This World Lethargic
You're Watching Us Peel

This Refreshing Stench Of Submission
Enough To Weaken The Strongest Of Men
Humiliated And Degraded
For The Greater Good
Swallowed Spit And Gagged On Blood
Awakened In Sin

Bow Down
Let All Your Fears Sink In
Submit
To Why We All Survive

Breathing Heavily
Sweating And Blood-Clotting
Building Character For Every Inch
This Profound Diabolic Learning
Is Invigorating As Your Cells They Flinch

Bow Down
Let All Your Fears Sink In
Submit
To Why We All Survive
