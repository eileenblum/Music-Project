Can You See Who's Standing Above
Looking Down On Something Grey
Casket Closing, You Can't Move
Biting Harder On That Gag

I Want You To Leave Me Far Behind
To Start Over And Create Something On Your Own
I Want You To Be Free From Me And Find
Someone Special To Call Your Own

There You Are, Flat On Your Back
Wondering How Did You End Up Here
When you're Breathing Down Someone's Neck
You Should Find Out About Who That Is

I Want You To Leave Me Far Behind
To Start Over And Create Something On Your Own
I Want You To Be Free From Me And Find
Someone Special To Call Your Own

Casket Closing, You Can't Move
Biting Harder On That Gag
Casket Closing, You Can't Move
Trying To Scream But No One Is There

Do You Know Why They Want You Dead?
