Monday Morning Feeling

I'm Just Walking By Myself
In A Crowd Of Thousand Heads
All Of Them Looking At My Face
Like Something's Missing In My Life

Oh Everything I've Been Fighting For
Is Behind The Next Closed Door
I've Been Fighting All My Life
I Want To Turn This Page Around

All These People Passing By
I Don't Think Anybody Smiles
It's Kind Of A Monday Morning Feeling
I've Got To Chase The Boredom Out

Oh Everything I've Been Fighting For
Is Behind The Next Closed Door
I've Been Fighting All My Life
I Want To Turn This Page Around

Turn The Page Now
Please Erase My
Monday Morning Feeling

Oh Everything I've Been Fighting For
Is Behind The Next Closed Door
I've Been Fighting All My Life
I Want To Turn This Page Around
