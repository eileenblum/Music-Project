Did you ever believe that this could be a way to think?
To open up your mind to something other than the way you were...
Jesus Christ is crawling in your head
I think I know the truth but your
Brainwashed mind ain't ready so

I brace myself to say
I am the one
For me today
I am the one

Take a walk with me
And listen to my thoughts
We can all do something
So they'll start to see the truth
Turn around their heads
Make them see the fact
We can all do something
So they'll start to see the truth

If you really need someone to put your
Beliefs in now
Turn your head at someone real
Yes, put your faith in me

You just try 'cause I
I am the one
Just say the phrase
I am the one
