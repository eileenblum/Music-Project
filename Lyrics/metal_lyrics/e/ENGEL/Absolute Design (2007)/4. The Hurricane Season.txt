Did You Inhale The Dust?
Take A Deeper Breath?
Feel Safe? Let's Start Again
Ripping Apart The Seams
Controlled, Yet Now Collapsed

Is This When Time Implodes?
As We See, The Walls Came Down
Naked? Then Dry Our Tears

We're Wrapped Up In A Tight, Silky Web
Like The Larvae, Feeding Upon Remains

Open Our Mind And Let It Drift Away
This Endless Moment, Never To Raise Its Siege
Open Our Mind And Let It Drift Astray
There's No Awakening, Never Am I To Sleep

Being Baptized Again
Renamed To Cold And Hollow Words
But Do I
Want This To End?
Controlled, yet Now Collapsed
This Is When Time Implodes
The Hurricane Season's Here
Cover My Ears

We're Wrapped Up In A Tight, Silky Web
Like The Larvae, Feeding Upon Remains

Open Our Mind And Let It Drift Away
This Endless Moment, Never To Raise Its Siege
Open Our Mind And Let It Drift Astray
There's No Awakening, Never Am I To Sleep
