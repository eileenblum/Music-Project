Waking - Here We Go Again
Basting Pieces, De-Skinning My Bones
Wading Through Old Blood And Stains
Restructuring The Crime
To Reach The End Of The Line

Angelic Choirs Sing - Am I Forgiven?

Split My Flesh To Reveal
There's Nothing Left To Curse
Tearing My Wounds In Vain
When Seeking For Myself In Pain

Fading Into A Brand New Day
Godless Dreams Breeds A Hopeless Wake
Scarring These Old Wounds Again
Preparing My Demise Yet Expecting Reprise

Demonic Legions Shriek - I Am Forsaken

Split My Flesh To Reveal
There Is Nothing Left To Curse
Tearing My Wounds In Vain
When Seeking For Myself In Pain
