It's buried inside
All the hate you feel
No one left for you to deny
Never to hold alone
Are you enjoying the lost you've done?
Carrying the weight from the lies is insanity

Lying is what you know
Run perfection row
It's turning you inside out
And light the flame burn out

Give up your eyes
When colors fade away
Look at what you hurting
Around you
Step this will this time
Before you go and commit your crime
Now you are coming to the end

Lying is what you know
Run perfection
It's turning you inside out
And light the flame burn out
