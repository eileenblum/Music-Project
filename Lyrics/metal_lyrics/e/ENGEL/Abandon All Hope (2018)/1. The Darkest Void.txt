Time will end, so get what you're after
Lives been spent, a total disaster

Time will end, so get what you're after
Lives been spent, a total disaster

Time will end, so get what you're after
Lives been spent, a total disaster

You're not my master
Why keep thinking that you are
Better off with you loneliness
You're not a part of my soul

You're poison, the world's bleeding out
I will never let you take part of me
Let go of it all

This is the age of light behind the sun
Now we go way down into our darkest void
So save us all
I know our time is running low
This is the end of the line at the edge of sorrow

Time will end, so get what you're after
Lives been spent, a total disaster

I'm pushing forward
Through all your blindness
Getting ready to wreck your world
You're in different state of mind
You refuse the knock on your door

The inevitable ending
Lost the touch with your soul

This is the age of light behind the sun
Now we go way down into our darkest void
So save us all
I know our time is running low
This is the end of the line at the edge of sorrow

This is the age of light behind the sun
Now we go way down into our darkest void
So save us all
I know our time is running low
This is the end of the line at the edge of sorrow

This is the age of light behind the sun
Now we go way down into our darkest void
So save us all
I know our time is running low
This is the end of the line at the edge of sorrow

Time will end, so get what you're after
Lives been spent, a total disaster

Time will end, so get what you're after
Lives been spent, a total disaster
