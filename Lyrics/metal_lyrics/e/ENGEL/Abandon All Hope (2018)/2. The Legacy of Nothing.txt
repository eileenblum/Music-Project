In the end we all left in a dream
Let your fate be the last of changes
Why neglect when we all hear the scream
No more time and there's no return
Can't you see we are here for our greed
We can aim for the darkest yearning
To believe in a reality
Is to face all your worst fears
Let me in, I am here
Create your legacy
When there's no more despair
I am your destiny
Stay gone and you will never fight your way
You chose to rip my peel off
The colors forever grey

At the end we'll have everything
When there's dust for the final taking
How can I be a part of your dream
When you tear down my whole world
Let me in, I am here
Create your legacy
When there's no more despair
I am your destiny
Stay gone and you will never fight your way
You chose to rip my peel off
The colors forever grey
Let me in, I am here
Create your legacy
When there's no more despair
I am your destiny
Stay gone and you will never fight your way
You chose to rip my peel off
The colors forever (grey)
Let me in, I am here
Create your legacy
When there's no more despair
I am your destiny
Stay gone and you will never fight your way
You chose to rip my peel off
The colors forever grey
