I see your deeds
Your acts speaks to me
You try to hide yourself behind a mask of honesty
You're in control
You deal at all the cords
Your face is straight as you pretend
And tell your lies to me

I try to leave
I try to walk away
I wanna disappear
And never see your face again
It's just a game
It's just a TV show
It's just a contract that you sign
With you ...

How can we live in peace
How can we hear each others cries
How can we breath the same air
When you believe on book of lies

You close your eyes
You block the pain right out
You turn your back
On all the suffering surrounding you
It makes you blind
It makes you deaf and dumb
It makes you trust in men who say
They know much more than you

What really ...

In generations yet to come
What will you say
What will you tell them all
Just put your faith in

How can we live in peace
How can we hear each others cries
How can we breath the same air
When you believe on book of lies
How do you sleep at night
How can you look me in the eyes
Can you tell wrong from right?
When you believe on book of lies
