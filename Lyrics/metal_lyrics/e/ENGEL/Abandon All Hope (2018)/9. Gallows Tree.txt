I'm dreaming it's surreal
A darkness appeal
A journey in disguise
(Gallows tree, nothing is what it seems)

A life with not living
A death note you're giving
Keep saying your goodbye
(I've got nothing left ...)

Forgotten, be left alone
No one ever guess today
Reborned to the unknown
Shadows drag you far away
Forgotten, be left alone
Gallows set a side to live
The black clouds they hunts you down
Make you wish away the pain

I'm certain, I know
It's coming, below
It's send a life inside
(...collide)
The worlds collide
On open play
The rest in time

The darkness unveil me
A sickness ablinds me
You sad "no way" and smile
(.............)

Forgotten, be left alone
No one ever guess today
Reborned to the unknown
Shadows drag you far away
Forgotten, be left alone
Gallows set a side to live
The black clouds they hunts you down
Make you wish away the pain
