Heaven is a state of mind
Someday it will make you blind
Others say it's all a fantasy
No place if you don't agree
Or question the authority
A mighty space still needs to be it's free

I feel I'm falling
I saw the writing on the wall
I feel the calling
To be an outcast standing tall
I feel the hunger
To be different to all
I feel I'm falling
I feel I'm burning as I fall

Power just for power seek
Who's to say it's all a fake
Haven't got the right to break my chain
Cross my heart and hope do die
I do my best to reach the sky

I feel I'm falling
I saw the writing on the wall
I feel the calling
To be an outcast and standing tall
I feel the hunger
To be different to all
I feel I'm falling
I feel I'm burning as I fall
