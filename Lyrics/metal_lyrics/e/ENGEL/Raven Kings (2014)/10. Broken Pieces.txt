A broken mind live out its final call
Looking back to where Iâm used to fall
How can I overcome and stay on top
I have to be the one to make it stop

As I fall in to broken pieces

I am not the one
You can kill the wrath has just begun
I am not your fate
I am not your fate

You took my soul and threw it far away
Am I still waiting of that brand new day
I never thought youâd be the one to dream
About the darkest place inside of me

As I fall in to broken pieces

I am not the one
You can kill the wrath has just begun
I am not your fate
I am not your fate

I am not the one
You can kill the wrath has just begun
I am not your fate
I am not your fate

Yeah

I am not the one
You can kill the wrath has just begun
I am not your fate
I am not your fate

I am not the one
You can kill the wrath has just begun
I am not your fate
I am not your fate
