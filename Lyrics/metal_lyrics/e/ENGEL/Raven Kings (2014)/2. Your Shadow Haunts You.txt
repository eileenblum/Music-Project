Break free from all these chains
I will not take the blame
Time is not on our side
A lesson learned in life

A race in life without a finish line
The scar is growing inside us

Break free from all these chains
I will not take the blame
Time is not on our side
A lesson learned in life

The bitter taste is here to stay
Your shadow haunts you
Youâd better start to realise
Youâre not eternal

Itâs time to analyse
Itâs time to bring back life

Break free from all these chains
I will not take the blame
Time is not on our side
A lesson learned in life

You are struggling against yourself
When you had a choice in the end

Break free from all these chains
I will not take the blame
Time is not on our side
A lesson learned in life
