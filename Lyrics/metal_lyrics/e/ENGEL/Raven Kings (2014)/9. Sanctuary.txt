Behind my deepest thoughts your still inside my mind

I am the reason youâre still alive
Fall back to safe zones, there Iâll be waiting

Can you be grateful? In hope of a better day

No need to worry, Iâll drag you down
Still in a hurry, make haste your turn to die

Thoughts of redemption, goes through my mind
Scratch the surface, see what Iâve found

Can you be grateful? In hope of a better day

No need to worry, Iâll drag you down
Still in a hurry, make haste your turn to die
No need to worry, Iâll drag you down
Still in a hurry, make haste your turn to die

I could never walk alone, till the end of time
I could never hurt your home, there I stay strong

No need to worry, Iâll drag you down
Still in a hurry, make haste your turn to die
No need to worry, Iâll drag you down
Still in a hurry, make haste your turn to die
