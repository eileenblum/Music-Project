Take a close look at our actions
You know they roam free

Buy solutions now, who will pay the price
All the wrongful crimes they are suffocating me
The extinction

Who are to blame, when the earth burns
We are all the same

Beg your fellow man, help to take a stand
Watch the sickness spread it comes close to bring the end

I feel too lost to see the answer
This I say to you

We donât know, why we go too far
We donât know, when it shows
We donât know, why we go too far
We donât know

We donât know why, such a disgrace
Your God keeps on laughing

Start the flame, ignite, people die tonight
Nowhere left to run when the darkness comes to you

We donât know, why we go too far
We donât know, when it shows
We donât know, why we go too far
We donât know

No we wonât know, âtil the end
Reap what you sow

We donât know, why we go too far
We donât know, when it shows
We donât know, why we go too far
We donât know, weâll never know

The extinction
