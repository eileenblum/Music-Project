So, now you got it all, the world belongs to you
Where do we go from here, how can you even move
Be prepared to fall, be the one to crawl
No way, no way, youâre in denial

The blindfoldâs on

Do you even see, what lies before your eyes
Do you see, what lies before your eyes
Can you reach the sky, will you keep the pride
Afraid, afraid, youâre such a coward

The blindfoldâs on, a wrong dream world

Now, now youâre falling, no one will save you
Be, be the greatest, youâve been found guilty

So, now you lost it all, the world it falls apart
Retrace your steps alone, how can you even start
Take the leap and fall, stay the same and crawl
No way, no way, youâre in denial

The blindfoldâs on, a wrong dream world

Now, now youâre falling, no one will save you
Be, be the greatest, youâve been found guilty

So, now you got it all, the world belongs to you
Where do we go from here, how can you even move
Be prepared to fall, be the one to crawl
No way, no way, youâre in denial

Now, now youâre falling, no one will save you
Be, be the greatest, youâve been found guilty
