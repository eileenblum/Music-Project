Their own self obsession
A new way of abuse
Set on false protection
Make up your mind and choose

Every time I try to help another
Everything turns into shit, why bother
Turned away from you
Our complicated dream came true

Pain piercing time
Blinding my crime
Pain piercing time
Blinding my crime

Fading light into another world unknown
You will never be the one
Fading light into another world unknown
You will never be the one

Take away the life force
Carry the devil inside
Burn me out with no remorse
Thereâs no where left to hide

Fading light into another world unknown
You will never be the one
Fading light into another world unknown
You will never be the one

Here right now
Blind, theyâre rising
Fading into the light
The world, itâs still unknown to me

Fading light into another world unknown
You will never be the one
Fading light into another world unknown
You will never be the one
