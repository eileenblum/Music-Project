Fighting on, weâve tried it all
Down below, down below
Found a way, inside my mind I stay
Alone I roam

No way out, wonât reach the stars
Or make it home, make it home
Dying soul, a lost control
Another pain belongs

Life unknown
Time has gone
Hollow soul
Story told

Torn apart, Iâve found it hard
To go on, to go on
Need a break, itâs not to late
Stay among us all

Life unknown
Time has gone
Hollow soul
Story told

Life unknown
Time has gone
Hollow soul
Story told
