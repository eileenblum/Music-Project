Another battle, another lost hope
Weâve all been fighting for nothing
Another fire, another false score
Weâve all been dying for something

A world that has fallen behind
Starts to unravel mankind
Listen to me my old friend
See we will lose in the end

I feel the evil eyes closing in
A wrath that will strike you all down
I hear the last of love crying out
Salvation is fading away

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that youâll set things right
As Iâm standing my ground

Fight, back, donât let their hate grab a hold
Of, our, love thatâs worth dying for

We need to find a way out of this
The fear will be broken in half
It feeds on all of us who believe
A world that someday will be free

Another battle, another lost hope
Weâve all been fighting for nothing

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that youâll set things right
As Iâm standing my ground

Fight, back, donât let their hate grab a hold
Of, our, love thatâs worth dying for

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that youâll set things right
As Iâm standing my ground

I honour the brave who fight
For the rest of us
I know that youâll set things right
As Iâm standing my ground
