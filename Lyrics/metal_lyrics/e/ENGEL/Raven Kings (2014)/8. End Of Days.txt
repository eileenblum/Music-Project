First off, you should know one thing
I donât care what you think of me
There is just these words for you
It is all that I have to do

I have never felt so free before
And I still believe that I will find some more of my
Revenge, oh so dear to me
There is not much left to say

You thought that it was time
But I will stay alive
Showing you till the end of days

I will always be more than you
And I know youâll never win
Iâm stronger than I ever was
You have lost

No, there is nothing left for you
You did not break through

You thought that it was time
But I will stay alive
Showing you till the end of days
You thought that it was time
I will stay alive
You will not be the end of me

Somewhere I feel the pain left inside
Which reminds me of what youâve think youâve done
Let the burning feeling transfer back to you
See the light at the end where you
Beg for mercy

You thought that it was time
But I will stay alive
Showing you till the end of days
You thought that it was time
I will stay alive
You will not be the end of me

Of me
