Starting over a part of me
Still believes that I am free
My perception of a real world
Slipping through my bleeding hands

My dark path
Draws me in

We will rise, we will rise
And reach the skies, the skies

Passing over, the new beginningâs
Keep my heart inside my soul
Follow darkness, submerged in pain
Dream of all the promised lies

My dark path
Draws me in

We will rise, we will rise
And reach the skies, the skies
We will rise, we will rise
And reach the skies

We will rise, we will rise
And reach the skies, the skies
We will rise, we will rise
And reach the skies
