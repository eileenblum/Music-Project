Coming out of the woodwork, and here we go. On a steady climb to get mine, just so you know. Shots in the night cause two wrongs
make a right. I got mad peeps, so I roll mad deep. ETAC's got my back, no need to worry kid. 

Never look back, never look back, I Repeat. Never look back, never fuckin' look back. Time to seed out the ones in which I could
confide, from all the other suckas just along for the ride. Since the day one, I was a stray one, who was there for the other
suckas just along for the ride. Since the day one, I was a stray one, who was there for there for me, no one see, and that's the
way it will always be. 

Always an obstacle, but still you managed to succeed on your own with no help and two mouths to feed. Through all the fights in
the middle of the night you still raised us right, and said, "Never lose sight." Red and blue sirens and do not cross signs, boy,
those were some fucked up times. But now I put it in the back of my mind so I don't sweat it. I keep it in, but I will never
regret it. 

Give me some room, gimme some room. 

You killed yourself for us, and eveayr night I watched you cry. You'd sit me down and tell me listen, "He doesn't know what he
is missing." Constantly broke my heart and torn apart from the start. I had my head on straight. Life headed straight for the
ground. Until you caught grip, and slowed that shit down.

I had a dream, I dreamt the pain was gone. Headed left, right, right, left behind. Poisoned my world, grown man at the age of
twelve. There's enough hate in my veins.
