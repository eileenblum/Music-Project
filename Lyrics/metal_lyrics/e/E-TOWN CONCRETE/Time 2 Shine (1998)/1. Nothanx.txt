Stay focused son and it will be all right. Although I must admit life is trite but that's all right. Keep moving on and try to
keep your mind occupied. No sense in stressing, though it hurts, memories won't die. A tear falls under a blood red sky. Close
your eyes, if you want to die, True people represent when times get difficult. Think about who's looking out. No you can't tell
me no. I grab what I can't have ... I take. I don't need your help. I knew it. I saw that shit way back when, things were
different then, all the promises and such and such. I didn't know much. You thought. I don't need your help. I help myself kid.
Life was never easy on my Mom Duke's, raising up two youths, with no loot and no future to boot. But she got it done, with out
help of anyone she got it done.
