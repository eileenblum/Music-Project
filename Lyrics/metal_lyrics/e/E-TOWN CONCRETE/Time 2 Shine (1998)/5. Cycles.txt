All is well life is hell, sometimes I wanna cry, a tear will never fall from these eyes. Misfortune turns to knowledge, and
knowledge turns to strength, strength helps you move on, and move on is what I did. It's what I didn't do that mattered. 

Look at what you've done, telling me I don't count, and that I won't amount to much it's such I'm losing touch and it's fucked
up, the shit that had you sucked up, when I was young it was all about hate, at a time I changed my mind but now it's back to
basics. Walked through the flame with this pain in my eyes, that's all right cause I'm doubtless, I will survive. 

Why can't you just leave me be, why must you stand in my way. Now I wait, wait for the day, for you to see the light I see. Look
at what you've done! 

If I took your life could I keep mine? Look at what you've done.
