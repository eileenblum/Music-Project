The future was bright, begin a new life. No more waking up at night from the fights at the bar across the street. Finally I can
fuck in peace without my little brother sneaking peeks, it's deep. I'll miss punching holes in the walls when I'm upset. I'll
miss arguing saying things that I regret. And yo, even though it was planned and we was set, I knew inside, it wasn't over yet. 

As his body deadens, her eyes redden, become puffed out and let one tear out to celebrate two years out. It's two years less I
guess, moving back, losing everything got you stressed. It's kinda' sad though, we was on the map, and now we're going back. No
fear I got your back, always forever, always. I got your back, I got this. 

Don't you worry, if things don't work out, (which they will) I'ma blow up still and pay off your bills. For real, I'll take
these presidents, hit you off with something elegant - a house that's lovely - have you living plushy, sleeping comfortably,
living way too dope to be having worries. I got this. 

The start of another ending. If you feel hate throw your hands up, if you ever felt pain throw your hands up. You gotta'
maintain, step up and never fall back, keep it true through and through, and you can do that. Realize, open your eyes your best
friends are you worst enemies ... sometimes.
