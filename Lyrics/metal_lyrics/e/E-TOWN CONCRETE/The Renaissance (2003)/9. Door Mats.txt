okay, i'm reloaded and all ya'll bastards is done freeloading.
we took the script, flipped it, cause' we wrote it
and if you ain't notice, i'm so goddamn focused and

dominant, while ya'll cats is dormant.
turn em' into doormats, let my footprints adorn it.
cause' i want it. and ya'll really don't.
i wish you really would, but ya'll really won't.

we be tough like the concrete.
we get right back on our feet.
we get up after we fall.

we keep it gangsta that mostest.
what you know about tours, sleeping on floors
with the rats and roaches?
we been paid our dues, matter of fact we overpaid.
say goodbye, your welcome has overstayed.
