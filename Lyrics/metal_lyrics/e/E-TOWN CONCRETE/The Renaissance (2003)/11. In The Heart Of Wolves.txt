there can be no mercy in the heart of wolves
there can be no shelter in the eye of the storm
cast into the flames to burn and to die and burn
but instead i found comfort in it's core

unscathed. i chose the road that's unpaved.
unfazed. i laid in the bed that i made.
through rain or shine or rise or fall i won't fall short
i'll win it all. expect me to be the net that is here to catch your fall.

flame, flicker, flicker, flame
fighting foes you can't contain
adversity made me the fighter i learned to be
i yearn to be so far on top that
through rain or shine or rise or fall i won't fall short
i'll win it all. expect me to be the net that is here to catch your fall.

burn the fuck down.
you will crumble just like the ashes
you will melt within my flame.
