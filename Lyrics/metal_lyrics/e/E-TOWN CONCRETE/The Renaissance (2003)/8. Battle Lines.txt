i draw my line in the sand and this is where i intend to stand
and that's my plan. you wanna snatch what's mine? i will
trash you hands. you don't know me like that my fam.
i'm trying to make you understand.
i'm here to win, i'm not trying to make friends.
so lose the smile, there's no need to pretend.

if you're not with us then you're against us.
we can battle down in the trenches
i'll snatch your necklace
i'll eat you punks for breakfast

we had a vision for years with no will to surrender
a flame inside that burns infinite.
look into my eyes again, what do you see?
i'm unconquered and i'm rising to victory.
time will only tell what you dread
..it's our grain you're against
i'm charged by the weight of your words
i will not carry you as i ascend.

if you're not with us then you're against us.
when you doubted me, you doubted yourself
i will not carry you as i ascend.

brace yourself for the fist

if you're not with us then you're against us. don't smile at mee
i don't need anyone, anyone, no one.
