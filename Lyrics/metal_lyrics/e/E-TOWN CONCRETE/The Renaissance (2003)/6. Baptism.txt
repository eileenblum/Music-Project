the day is mine, the night is also mine.
thou hast set all the borders of this earth.
but i've never been one to believe in the preconceived limit
that's set for me. i'll spit in the face of the haters as i march
closer to victory.

and my time is here. my time
and my time is now.

and that's the god's honest
combine this with the knowledge that i've acquired
learning from my mistakes, i'm baptized by fire.

i've had the ground fall from beneath my toes.
scraped my knees on the concrete, and still i rose.

this war has just begun.
