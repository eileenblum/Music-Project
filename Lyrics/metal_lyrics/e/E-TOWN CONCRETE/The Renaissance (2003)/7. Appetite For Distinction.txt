i am back with a vendetta
with that same hunger that i had back in the day when my
tv had a hanger for an antenna. ya'll is just beginners,
we been sweated through hot summers and froze in cold
winters. and now you ask "that the fuck got in us?"
shit.. you wanna know? let me explain this:

it's the same shit that we came with back in '95
built our name with. we maintained it and now your lame clique
wanna come out of thin air trying to claim this.
listen, you ain't shit, and your just about through.

to all my people who was close to me
to all my people who used to smile and boast with me
or rose a toast with me how come we ain't down like we supposed to be?
everything we got, we got the hard way.
we built this brick our way, our way.

so put you, put your hands up high.
so put you, put your hands up high.
i'm so fuckin hungry that i'm starving to death,
i'm trying to eat until there's no food left.
i'm trying to breathe until i got no breath.

i'm coming through putting dents in the game.
i'm sick and tired of all these wack bands sounding the same.
you should've rented your name, i'm ending your 15 minutes
of fame. i'm here now, things will change.
a rock n' roll singer with a rap mentality.
it's your fault, you did this, you brought this out of me.
doubting me ain't never got no one nothing but proved wrong.
i've been doing this here for too long

this is the sound of the world coming down.
