everyday we hit the ground running
we keep the crowd jumping, we keep the club bumping, we give you all something,
it don't matter how we flip our style because we make it happen.
so versatile i hit you screaming or i'll hit you rapping.
now what-cha yapping, shut your trap before you catch a slapping.
stop your whining, it's our time and this was bound to happen.
now put your hands together and get to clapping.
clap-clap-clap, before i get to clapping.

you know that we rock, ain't afraid to roll, you know that the concrete
will crack your skull, i'm trying to make about a thousand o's
so let's go. you know that we rock, ain't afraid to roll,
you know that the concrete will crack your skull,
i'm trying to rip about a thousand shows, so let's go.

every night we coming out swinging, we get the crowd singing,
ears ringing, listen, we do our damn thing man
it don't matter how you knock us down because we're still kicking
it don't matter how you hate my style because i'm still spitting
it don't matter how we flip our style because we make it happen.
so versatile i hit you screaming or i'll hit you rapping.
now what-cha yapping, shut your trap before you catch a slapping.
stop your whining, it's our time and this was bound to happen.
now put your hands together and get to clapping.
clap-clap-clap, before i get to clapping.
