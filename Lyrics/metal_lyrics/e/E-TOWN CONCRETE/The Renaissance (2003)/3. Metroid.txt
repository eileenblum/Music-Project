they say that which has been born into the darkness
shall come into the light.. step into the light

i've had my dreams slip out from beneath my nose.
in a world so cold that my heart was frozen.
journey beyond the pale white snow
and emerge from the winter of my discontent
i won't consent to anything less that 110%
i won't lament, lay, or lick my wounds.
i will not repent, kneel or bow to you.. fuckin fool.

hold on to my hand.
walk with me from your demise.

i won't retreat.
i won't be made weak by the thorns in my feet.
i will walk til' i bleed or die from fatigue and beyond if need be.
believe me, you will not defeat me, i swear to god.
and that's a promise i'll keep until i'm 6 feet deep motherfucker.
