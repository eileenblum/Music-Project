hard times build character, or so i'm told. they teach you lessons worth their weight in gold. and i've been shown things happen
for a reason.

i know your kind. you want one thing: the gusto. keep it in mind. i know your kind. 

what up chief? you's a shifty thief with shaydee eyes. play the role like a toughguy. you need a grammy. it's wack. smile to my
face, talk behind my back. in fact, when i'm around you be riding my sac. your shit is played out. try and use me to get your
name out, so you can stay out, cash in the fame no doubt. i ain't stupid. i know what your about son. getting that clout done, so
you can attract a bigger crown dunn. yeah, you's a foul one. always preach "keepin it real", when you're a fake bitch handing out
raw deals. your shit is too sloppy to have appeal. your style is too cliche for masses to feel. 

you's a shaydee jealous bitch, try and play me to get rich. fit in my niche. 

e.town. 

this goes out to my peeps up in the crowd. this goes out to my niggas getting wild. this goes out to the kids that's
representing. this goes out to toughguys teaching lessons. this goes out to those that are true. this goes out to you.
