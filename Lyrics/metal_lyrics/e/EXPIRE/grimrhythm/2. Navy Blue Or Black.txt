Born from boredom into poison the stupid shit that we do these days. Well I can't lie; I'm just as guilty. I wear it all on my fucking face. So who am I to say anything? So who am I to place blame? The guilt could eat a man alive but I ain't got any shame. I've got my problems I've got my vices but I'm learning to live with my mistakes. I just take it all with a grain of salt. That taste just doesn't go away.
