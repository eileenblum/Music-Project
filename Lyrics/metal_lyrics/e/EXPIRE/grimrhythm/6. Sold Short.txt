Something's wrong. Something's broken. Nothing's new, but here's hoping things might just change. Young and pissed, confused and sick. With no one to turn to but my fists so I swing away. Swing away the hate. I get so fucking disappointed. I feel like I've been sold short. I get that feeling in my stomach. I'm at the point where I don't even care anymore.
