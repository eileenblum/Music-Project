Desperate for attention or maybe just desperate. Reaching out for anything to slow my descent into this hole. Goddamn, my soul feels darker than the circles around my eyes. I try to keep it all in the back of my mind. Though I hold you close I'll never let you in. So scratch a little harder. Dig a little deeper into my skin.
