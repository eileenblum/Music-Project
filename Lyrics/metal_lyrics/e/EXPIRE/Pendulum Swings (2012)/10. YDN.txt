Mama tried
I sold my soul to the devil
I never fit the mold
A young revel
Future is bleak
for this black sheep
Left out for the wolves to eat
I'm a product of my mistakes
Try to run from my past
but i could never escape
I turn and I face the music
and leave the rest up to fate
There are things I left behind
and lived to fight another day
I cut some ties
I lost some friends
Made enemies along the way
I walked a line
I changed my mind
I didn't like how the game was played
So crucify me if you will
for all the choices I have made.
