Woe is me
I dig deep
I'll never let myself be happy
It's all just doomed from the start
I truly want stability
But I tear everything apart
Don't have what I want
Don't want what I got
Never wanted much
Never had a lot
And I pray for the day
When I can be content in my own skin
No chances taken
No chances given
Help me to understand
Just why I am the way I am
I live in fear
Afraid to fail
Locked up inside my own jail
I built these walls, I'm trapped inside
How much longer can I hide?
Help me to make it right
Can't live in fear my whole life
