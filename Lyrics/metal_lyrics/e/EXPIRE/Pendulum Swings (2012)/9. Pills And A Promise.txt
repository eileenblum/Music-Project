Six long years
I've been nursing the pain
Six long years
I've been screaming your name
Summer heat
Sweating in my sleep
Just lay me down for an eternity
It was perfect
I didn't deserve it
I was so helpless as you slipped right from my fucking hands
And I have never been so confused
Courtesy of all your miscues
Erase away the mistakes we made
and blame them on our youth
I needed more than pills and a promise
I needed more than a bullshit excuse
You left me back holding the bag
and all I ever wanted was the truth
Nothing is working
This shit can't save me
I've been fucking going crazy
All the things I should've said
plays over and over in my head
