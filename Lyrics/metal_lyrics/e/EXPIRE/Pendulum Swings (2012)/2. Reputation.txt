Approach me with hesitation
Heard about my reputation
Lord knows I've tried to change
But fear it's much too late
There are things I could try to say
To try and sway you either way
But I just ran out of time
and the window's closed to change your mind
Can't help what i say
Can't help what I do
So much about me I wish you never knew
You got it all figured out
You keep me at arm's length
The blood's already on my hands
No changing what you think
