I'll never let you tie me down
to be a dog just barking on a chain
Jerk me back to reality
whenever I dare to dream
So let me curl my lips
Let me howl at the moon
Been looking down on me long enough
but my day's coming soon
No thanks to you
You can follow me through open doors
or you can wish me the best
I refuse to follow you under
You've been a weight on my chest
and when there's nothing left to say
I ask you kindly relocate
You're in my fucking way
