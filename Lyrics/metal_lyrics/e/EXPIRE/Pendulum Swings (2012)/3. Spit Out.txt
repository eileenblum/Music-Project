What was I to say?
You let me down and you walked away
What was I to do?
I never seen that side of you
Ignorance is bliss
Somehow it makes me wonder
how i could give two shits for a two-faced motherfucker
Chewed me up and spit me out
and left me to clean up the mess
Caught me off guard
and it's so hard
to try and let go of this
Your true colors are shining through
I'm no use to you
Chewed me up and spit me out
How could I still care about
someone who just threw me away
like I was nothing?
All the times you shook my hand
I couldn't conceive it
Turn your back on me, man?
I couldn't believe it
