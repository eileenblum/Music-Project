Brain melt
Note to self
Do you remember just how it felt?
Bit your tongue and you just dealt
Until it all boils over
That was your first mistake
Need I remind you
what got us here in the first place?
Anxiety
Won't let me go
So am I crazy?
Well, I don't know
I can't think straight
Anxiety gets the best of me
I take it all on the chin
Trying to figure out where the fuck it all went
Looking up from my back again
