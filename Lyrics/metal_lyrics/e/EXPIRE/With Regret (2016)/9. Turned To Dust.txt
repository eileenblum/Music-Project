United by fear divided by faith
Fighting fire with fire fighting hate with hate
Hell's finally kicked open the gate
And there's no time left to save face
Hope floats and I'm drowning in hypocrisy
A sea of shit world of war that's surrounding me
Kill the messenger who burst your bubble
And we're all in fucking trouble

No escaping we already lit the fuse
Acting like there's nothing left to lose
Where there's smoke there's fire and fire ashes we'll all be turned to dust
And on barren land our worthless possessions will all be left here to rust
