Medicine man gonna make me feel better
Medicine man gonna change my mind
Medicine man got the pad and pen
The signature to make me smile again
Medicine man gonna pick me back up
Medicine man gonna make my day
Medicine man got the magic pill
When nothing else will make me feel this way

Something wrong with my circuits
Something wrong with my schematics
Gotta get inside my head
Gotta rearrange my attic
I don't know where else to turn
But I been watching TV
Heard about a little something
Might just make me happy

Fix me up

I know you got it
So give me something
