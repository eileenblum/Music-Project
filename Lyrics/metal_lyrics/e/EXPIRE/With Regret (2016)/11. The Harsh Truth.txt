Is it enough to say I wanted it
Just how long until my heart catches up with my body
If the day don't come and I destroy myself
Will it all have been for nothing

I watched the road split in two
What am I to do?
I put myself on trial
Against the harsh truth

Stress lifted turning into stress shifted
Could the distance have made me distant
Measuring loss in miles crossed
Is there something that I'm missing

Held hostage by my youth
What am I supposed to do?
Don't make any sudden moves
And nobody gets hurt
