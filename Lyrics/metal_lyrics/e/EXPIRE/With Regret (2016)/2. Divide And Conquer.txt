In a divided better pick a side
Don't get caught up in fire behind enemy lines
You'd be hard pressed to find any moment in time for a fence walking motherfucker
Take away the middle and you're forced to choose
It's all black and white it's all red and blue somewhere out there yea that's you
Try to break away from the fucking pack

Hive mind begging to be classified
I don't I don't want to roll with the tide
I beg to differ I don't really give a damn
I won't let someone else tell me who or what I am

It's divide and conquer
It's a civil war
Watch us kill ourselves
And we don't know what for
