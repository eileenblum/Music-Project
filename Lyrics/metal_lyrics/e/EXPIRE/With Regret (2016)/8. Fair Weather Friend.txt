The lines between you and me
The points from A to B
Just don't connect like they did before
People change cities grow further away
Get replaced cut and past
Who needs you anymore

Fair-weather friend
It's good to see you again
Forgot your face
Don't know how long it's been
Come and go like the wind
Whatever reason you found
I guess I'll see you around

I hear that time is a thief taking people from me
I miss them more than I ever have
Things change the clock keeps ticking away
Another place another face further back in the past
