Here I am killing myself again
Digging the same grave even deeper
Never content playing the same game
Killing the same love I don't need it

I never learn despite how many times
Keep my love buried inside
Dig the knife deeper drown out the cries
Keep my love hidden buried inside

Heart of stone veins turning ice cold
I've gone numb to both right and wrong
Looking for an answer infinite questions
In front of my face all along

Take my hand and put flesh on my bones
Beat my heart out of my chest just don't let me be alone
Girl you know where I've been and you know what I've done
Don't turn my past into my setting sun
