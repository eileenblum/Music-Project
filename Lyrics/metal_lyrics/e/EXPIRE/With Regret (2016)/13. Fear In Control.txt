Cool under pressure I am not
The fear engulfs me like electric shock
I feel it building up, up inside of me to it
I am weak

I feel the buzzing in my chest
I feel the chill of the cold sweat
Taking me by my trembling hand
And leading me into distress

Fear in control
Lord have mercy on my body and soul
I've fallen into the deepest of holes
And there's no way out

Out of my mind I can't escape
The fear engulfs me like a warm embrace
Like an old friend here to comfort me
And to it I am weak
