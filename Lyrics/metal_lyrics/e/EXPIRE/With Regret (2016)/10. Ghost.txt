Apparition in and out of view
Just a ghost no concern to you
Through the circles I, I come and go
Disappear and you'll never know

Pay me no mind
Pay me no mind
Don't ask about me I'm doing fine
Pay me no mind
Pay me no mind
Don't look my way avert your eyes

Wipe the slate clean
Try to forget
Bury the hatchet
Put it to rest
Gouge out every last memory
I'm be invincible just let me be

I'll be a ghost
That you didn't know
