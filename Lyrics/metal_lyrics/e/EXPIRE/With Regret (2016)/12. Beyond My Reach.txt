Try and I try to get myself out of the dirt
Scratch and I claw but nothing seems to work
Scanning the distance looking for the light
Nothing up ahead no end in sight

Everything seems to be beyond my reach
Everything that I need is just beyond my reach

So close but yet so far
Does it all have to bee so fucking hard?
Holding on by my finger tips
Afraid I'll start to lose my grip

Everything I seem to need
Get's further away from me
Moving backwards fall behind
Everything beyond my reach
