I felt the fire and I felt the ice
Felt the coldest of shoulders the burn in my eyes
I felt the sting and the sorrow it brings
I felt defeat felt sick and tired of everything

I'm being pulled apart
I'm being stretched too thin
Got one foot out the door
The other one still fucking in

I saw life and I saw death
Saw a smile on your face when there was nothing left
Sometimes I swear I see a glimmer of hope
I cry out for an answer and life says no

Spent my whole damn life looking towards the sky
I keep asking a god if I should life or die
