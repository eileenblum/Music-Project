Fighting the slip, I can't do it anymore
Your push and pull won't bring me down like it did before
A toxic waste of my time slowly killing me
It was all just a blur but I can finally see

I've given you enough of me
Gotta stay out of reach

I've given you enough of me
I gotta stay out

Fighting the slip can't keep falling into you
Won't get caught up in the tired shit you put me through
Quicksand suffocating me
Knowing that I am far more deserving

I've given you enough of me
Gotta stay out of reach

I've given you enough of me
Yeah, I gotta stay out
