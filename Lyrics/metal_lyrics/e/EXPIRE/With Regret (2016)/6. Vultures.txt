Vultures circling over my head
Looking for a bone to pick
Throw around your accusations
Just to see what sticks

Put me under your lens and magnify my faults
Twist and bend all my words to incriminate my thoughts

Hope you find your witch
Hope you scratch that itch
Hope it makes you feel better than me
You insecure son of a bitch

Step down off your soapbox
Hit the road kick rocks
