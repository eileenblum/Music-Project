Time tested, who could have guessed it? It was a waste of all Iâve invested memories, donât mean shit to me theyâve all been watered down where the fuck are you now? In my frustration , Iâm losing patience I ended up back here again a quick fix, over and out left a bad tasted in my mouth let my guard down, I let you in Iâm giving up never again took grip, I bit my lip took another swing it didnât work out, it never works out Iâm done trying
