oh how the time flies when youâre on the run from a motherâs tears to a long lost son thereâs tears to a long lost son thereâs a note left ringing in my ear thereâs an answer somewhere, just not here and Iâ out to find it separate, disguise I want to see the world through brand new eyes I donât ever want to blink again I donât ever want to think on it for too long I just want to know where I belong
