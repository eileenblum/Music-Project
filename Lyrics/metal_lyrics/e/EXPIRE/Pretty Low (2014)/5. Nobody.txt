You put out your hand
You call you me a friend
Forked tongue
Behind a smile
Now we all know
A Judas exposed
It was only a matter of time

Truth be told, you're nothing to me
Just a leech who tried to get my best
A last gasp before your final descent
Should've bit your tongue when you had the chance

Put out your hand
You call you me a friend
Forked tongue
Behind a smile
Now we all know
A Judas exposed
It was only a matter of time

No integrity
Riding coat tails
Made a name off the ones before
Lost focus
You walk alone
Just give it up
Nobody cares anymore

Nobody cares

No integrity
Riding coat tails
Made a name off the ones before
Lost focus
You fucking asshole
Just give it up
Nobody cares anymore

Nobody cares
