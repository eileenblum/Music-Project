Sweet caress
Kiss of death
You slay me, baby
Been trying to find a feeling
But I can't find it lately

So nothing good can come of this
So let's just call it what it is
'Cause I won't shed a tear for just another set of tits

Trying to find a feeling
That just don't exist
Trying to force emotion
That just don't fit

So let's not try and get carried away
Put ourselves between a rock and a hard place
Four letter words with nothing to it
I tried, I couldn't do it

The lights are on, but nobody's home

Trying to find a feeling
But it just don't exist
Trying to force emotion
But it just won't fit

Fucking shit
