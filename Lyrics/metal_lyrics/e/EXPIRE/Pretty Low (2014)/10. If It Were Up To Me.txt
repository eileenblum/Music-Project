Sworn to protect my blood and my flesh
From the harm of another
Look after little sister
Be a good brother

But the world is oh so cruel
and there is nothing I could do
When things don't go as planned
And you were dealt an evil hand

No excuse for what you've done
You just get a slap on the wrist
Because if it were up to me
You'd burn like a fucking witch
Yeah, if it were up to me

So you stood before a judge
And he put you in the slammer
You should've stood before a bullet
Than stood before a hammer

If it were up to me

Sworn to protect my blood and flesh
From the harm of another
Well I failed, but never again
See you in hell, motherfucker
