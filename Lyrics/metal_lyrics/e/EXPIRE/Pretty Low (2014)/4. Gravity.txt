I've been holding out
Never thought it would be this long
I fear the worst
I fear the worst is yet to come

Should I feel so fucking hollow?
Should I feel so alone?

I don't want to breathe this air
I don't want to take another breath
I need a way out
Give me a way out of this mess

Let me go and let me die
Release me from misery
Hang the rope, tie the knot
Let gravity set me free

Should I feel so fucking hollow?
Should I feel so alone?
I fear the worst is yet to come

I don't want to breathe this air
I don't want to take another breath
I need a way out
Give me a way out of this mess

Let me go and let me die
Release me from misery
Hang the rope and tie the knot
Let gravity set me free
