Mind, body, and soul
I gave to you
But under your pale skin
I could see it all
Now we pass each other like strangers
When I would have stood toe to toe with gods
For you

I was naive to everything
I would've given it all
But I've seen your second face
Can't play the role of the pawn
Every ounce, every ounce of faith
That I poured into you
I should've known all along
But I just played the fool

Count every second of every minute
Time wasted building up a hatred
Chose to ignore the truth
Refused to face it

Hanging by the tips of fingers
For too long I let it linger
I should've cut the rope
But I chose to live and suffer
When I should've just run for cover
Braved the storm
But it never stopped

I count every second of every minute
Time wasted building up a hatred
Chose to ignore the truth
Refused to face it

Chose to ignore the truth
Though I knew all along
Held on for my life
'fraid to take, 'fraid to take the fall
