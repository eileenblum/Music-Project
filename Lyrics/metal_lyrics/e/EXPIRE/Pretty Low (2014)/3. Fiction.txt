You had me at hell no
I only want what I can't have
You're always slipping through my fingers
Ain't that just too bad

I'm love with a work of fiction
Somewhere off in the distance
I'm in love with a list of things they tell me you should be

Programmed to TV pretty
Created such an ugly mind
Salivate for celebrity
Or a copy I might find

But if I had you in my claws
I'd expose every flaw
Programmed to plastic
Set fire to it all

I'm love with a work of fiction
Somewhere off in the distance
I'm in love with a list of things they tell me you should be

Programmed to TV pretty
Created such an ugly mind
Salivate for celebrity
Or a copy I might find

Programmed to plastic
Set fire to it
