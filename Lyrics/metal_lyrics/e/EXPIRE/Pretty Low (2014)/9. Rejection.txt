I only wish you knew
That when you pushed me out
It couldn't come too soon
A few years more than I could take
But i stood on my own
Without your embrace

Begged for me to come home
But I couldn't even care
I turned my face to the highway
And watched you disappear

Now you face the mirror of rejection
Your worst fear in the reflection

I wish I could feel your pain
I wish I could feel remorse
But you cast me out
Don't regret letting things run their course

Now you face the mirror of rejection
Your worst fear in the reflection

I wish I could feel your pain
I wish I could feel remorse
But you cast me out
Don't regret letting things run their course
