I don't know why we bother
To heed the words of our fathers
Turn in a day's work
To turn as blue as our collars

But that world is your oyster
Got to find your pearl
Got to make your money
Got to find your girl

Burnt my tongue on first taste
Bit off more than I could chew
Choked down a few years
Dragging heavy boots

But that world is your oyster
Got to find your pearl
Got to make your money
Got to find your girl

Yeah, right

Kiss the ass of the man
Just to survive
Force a fake smile
Hold back the tears from my eyes
You can eat till you puke
Get your piece of the pie
Break your back till you can't
and then roll over and die
