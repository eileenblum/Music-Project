If a mind is a terrible thing to waste
Maybe lust is a terrible thing to taste
Put it to your lips
Try and think straight

We are all young, dumb, and full of shit
Say anything to get a fix
Never wanted to feel
I just wanted to forget

Misery loves company
I just need a warm body
Shelter from the cold
Maybe just for a night

Tell me it's alright
Tell me everything's cool
Put my mind at ease
Numb me up again
Give me what I need

We are all young, dumb, and full of shit
Say anything to get a fix
Never wanted to feel
I just wanted to forget

Teach me how to forget
I want to live like I never met death
Focused in on the pain for far too long
Now I don't know the man I've become
