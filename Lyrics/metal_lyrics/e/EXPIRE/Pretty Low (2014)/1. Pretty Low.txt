Forever cloaked in stress
Wrapped tightly around my chest
Constricting every breath I might take
Inch closer to the edge
Move closer to the end
A little closer to the day I might break

I didn't know how far I could go
But baby, I'm feeling pretty low
Can't stop now
Can't lose control

Sinking like a brick
Thrown into the sea
Into the depths where no one else can find me
And if a day comes
Where I miss the the light
It's only I that can turn the tide

I didn't know how far I could go
But baby, I'm feeling pretty low
Can't stop now
Can't lose control

I'm at a crossroad
Where you choose
You either fight, or you lose
Refuse to let my life be reduced to rubble
When the shit keeps piling up, get a shovel.
