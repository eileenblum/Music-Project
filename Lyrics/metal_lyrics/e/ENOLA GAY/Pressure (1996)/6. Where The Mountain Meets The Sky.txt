From that day I was born, I was alone
I felt that I've got no home
No one there for me, no place to sleep
So I decided to go

'cause I'm afraid of getting old
And I'm afraid of dying in the cold
I am afraid of being alone
I'm afraid if I'm all on my own

Take me back to the mountain
To my place in the sky
Where I can live in freedom
Till the end that I die

I walk my way and leave my past behind
Before I lose my mind
Try to escape from here, from suicide
I don't believe in this world

'cause I'm afraid to fall down the stairs
And I'm afraid of wars everywhere
I am afraid of losing a chance
I'm afraid of the killing hands

[chorus]
