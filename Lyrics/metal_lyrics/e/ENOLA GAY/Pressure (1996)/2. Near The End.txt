Too many people live in a crowded world
And aren't safe in this fucking safety belt
Nobody finds their way in this crush
Sometimes we all get hushed
When our children are crying
And our babies are dying
Then we will see now it is enough

When the people die in the streets
Our conscience shall be unveiled
If we don't react upon facts
We are going to break our necks
But we are walking the edge of insanity
And we're not talking about the reality
We sail a course right straight to the end

Near the end - near the end - near the end

Our ears are always clogged
And our eyes are always closed
If we don't react upon facts
Have a look to the world's collapse
We are going to break our necks
Our native place is in danger
We treat the earth like a stranger
Earth mother will take revenge

Near the end - near the end - near the end
We will see where we did go wrong
We will see that it can't go on
Near the end - near the end - near the end
