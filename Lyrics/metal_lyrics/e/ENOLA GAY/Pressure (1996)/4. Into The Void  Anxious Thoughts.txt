That night as I went to bed
I had a very strange feeling
First I could not fall asleep
I remember that I was dreaming
And a knife stabs into my eyes and into my ears

Then there was silence and only darkness
Like I've never seen before
I opened my eyes and started to weep
Nothing to see the darkness so deep

Without sound for always dark
A deeper ache is in my heart

Did you ever have this alarming feeling?
Do you really know how my heart is bleeding?
Is there any way to get out of this state?
I don't wanna live no more, that's my fate

Without sound for always dark
A deeper ache is in my heart
