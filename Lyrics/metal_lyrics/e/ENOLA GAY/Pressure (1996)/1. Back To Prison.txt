They told me that I am a free man
As I go back to life
I just start to walk this road to nowhere
I'm prepared for life, I want to survive
I know that I was guilty, I expiate for my sins
I waste a part of my life, a new period begins

Back to prison or go back to hell
Go where you come from is all what they tell
I'm the bastard, the evil in town
Please excuse me that I was born

No more crimes that's what I swear
Where's my chance - hate is everywhere
They treat me always like an animal
One time in prison, forever criminal
I'm just a victim of law and order

I know that I was guilty, I expiate for my sins
I waste a part of my life, a new period begins

Back to prison or go back to hell
Go where you come from is all what they tell
I'm the bastard, the evil of life
Please excuse me that I am alive
