They taught me the ten commandments
By reading the holy book
I know to speak the lord's prayer
And to honour my own food
I see all the fated people
Try hard to make ends meet
Why don't you show no mercy?
I just kneel at your feet

Who's my god? - what's my god?
Hypnotized - when I pray to the altar
Who's my god? - where's my god?
Loneliness - I am all on my own

Maybe this is a false religion
No that I can't understand
Or am I just a helpless man
My lonely life is in your hand
You claimed so many victims
To steer a holy course
My life was full of diffidence
And you're without remorse

Who's my god? what's my god?
Hypnotized when I pray to the altar
Who's my god? where's my god?
Loneliness - I am all on my own

Now I'm already down
I am lying on the ground
But you don't care about me
You don't care about me
I ask you again and again
Hear my call, now here I am
Why don't you speak to me
Why don't you come with me
And have a look what's going on
Just have a look what's going on
I see frustration and hesitation
Give me salvation and set me free...
