[Written by Lennon / McCartney and originally performed by The Beatles]

Eleanor rigby  picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been, lives in a dream
Waits at the window wearing the face that she
Keeps in the jar by the door, who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father mc kenzie writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's
Nobody there, what does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor rigby died in the church and was buried
Along with her name, nobody came
Father mc kenzie wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave
No one was saved
