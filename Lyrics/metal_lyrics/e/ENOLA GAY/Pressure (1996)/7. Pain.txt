Hello, nice to meet you, they all call me pain
I know I'm not your friend, I drive you insane
I will sometimes be by your side
I will take you, I go for a ride
Somehow, I leave you, I go for a while
Call me enemy - or whatever you want
No life without me - I ain't no fun
I'm your pain, I will run for you
And at last I will find you
No escape, you can't run away
My breath always haunts you
Pain, pain, pain...

Of course, there's one thing, gulp down a heap
Some drugs to fight me will help you to sleep
But when you wake up the effect I'll abate
You're my next victim, I'm your hate
At last I'll show you, I laugh when you cry
I creep into you, right through your nerves
Intoxication - I know it's perverse
I'm your pain, I will run for you
And at last I will find you
No escape, you can't run away
My breath always haunts you
Pain, pain, pain...
