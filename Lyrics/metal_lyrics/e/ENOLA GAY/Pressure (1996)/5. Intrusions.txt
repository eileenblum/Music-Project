Activity is never absent in a healthy livin' brain
And the unwanted thoughts come back again
Neurons are always active
Even in a drowsy kind
And depressions are not past
They're still in my mind

I'm faltering again through my livin' brain
Resurgence of unwanted thoughts
Promoting my negative mood

Resurgence of unwanted thoughts

[chorus]
