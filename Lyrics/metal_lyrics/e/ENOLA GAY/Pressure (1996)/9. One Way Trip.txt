Is there really just one life
Or am I on a journey into another one
Take my hand I will miss you 'cause my life
Is fading away - will you visit me?

This is the point of no return
Just one step into another world
Say goodbye, this is your last chance
To finish the romance
You don't have to cry, when my life passes by
Death is the end in this one way trip
Please carry on, just what we've begun
I just was a part in your one way trip

Death is the end in this one way trip
Death is the end in this one way trip

Will you be there beside me please take me
Away and hold me in your arms
I can't speak, I can't hear, I can't see
Now it's seconds to none
Are you strong enough?

[pre-chorus - chorus]

I feel so cold tonight, can't see in colours
... only black and white, when death calls...
