Prepared to sound them
There came hail and fire
Mixed with blood
It was hurled down
The earth was burned up
Like something all ablaze
Huge mountains
Thrown into the sea

"Wormwood" The great star
"Wormwood" Blazing like a torch fell from the sky
Waters turned bitter

Sounded his trumpet
The day turned dark
Also the night
Without light
The star was given the key
To the shaft of the abyss
Locusts with strings striking

"Wormwood" The great star
"Wormwood" Blazing like a torch fell from the sky
Waters turned bitter
