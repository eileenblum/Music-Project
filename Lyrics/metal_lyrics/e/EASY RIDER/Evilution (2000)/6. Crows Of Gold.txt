Before me was a door standing open in heaven
Come up here and I will show you
What must take place after this

Before me was a throne in heaven
Seven lamps where blazing
A rainbow encircled the throne
Resembling an emerald

Before the throne there
Was what looked like a sea of glass
Four living creatures
Covered with eyes all around

Crows of gold, Flashes of lightning
Rumblings and peals of thunder
Crows of gold, Flashes of lightning
Rumblings and peals of thunder

The first was like a lion
The second was like an ox
Th third had a face like a man
The fourth was like a flying eagle

Before the throne there
Was what looked like a sea of glass
Four living creatures
Covered with eyes all around

Crows of gold, Flashes of lightning
Rumblings and peals of thunder
Crows of gold, Flashes of lightning
Rumblings and peals of thunder
