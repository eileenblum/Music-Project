Welcome to our sea of madness
A place where nothingÂ´s real
The soundÂ´s your guiding light
Your time machine

Savage rage!
This is the power of music
Savage rage!
Â´Cause thatÂ´s the way we like to play
Savage rage!
ThatÂ´s how the times are changing
Savage rage!
Because of this we carry on
ItÂ´s the music that runs through our veins

You hear the people talking
You walk the wrong street
Running beside Satan and livinÂ´ in hell
"Look at their appearance"
"They canÂ´t give us something good"
Times are now changing and memory fades

The sound is telling you a story
A tale of fame and fantasy
You can escape at last from reality
Magic words are dancing
I can feel now wings to fly
Realise that musicÂ´s like a rising sun

Let the nymphs, dragons and heroes
Penetrate inside your mind
Let the savage rage
Dominate all your dreams
Music, music!, that is Savage
Rage, rage!, ThatÂ´s what we are
ItÂ´s the most powerful fury
You can feel inside
