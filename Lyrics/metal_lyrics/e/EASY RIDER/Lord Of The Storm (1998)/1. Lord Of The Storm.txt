Who controls the facts!
Who controls the destiny!
And who controls the answers
To all our questions!
Imagination plus education is domination
Pain and misery... Why am I here!

The Lord of the storm

He controls the facts!
He controls our destiny!
And he knows the answers
I wish he will be here now
To see what we have done
What we have destructed
What we have created

HeÂ´s the answer
When youÂ´re calling for the reason
It stands to reason that
SomeoneÂ´s pulling the strings
We cry out for more
We wonder whatÂ´s next to the world
We are the last before the tornado

IÂ´m your life, IÂ´m your soul
IÂ´m your faith and IÂ´m your hope
Try to scape... thereÂ´s a chance
Keep the words inside your head
Are you scared of what you see?
Are you scared to rearrange?
The choice is yours and mine....
... Or isnÂ´t it?
