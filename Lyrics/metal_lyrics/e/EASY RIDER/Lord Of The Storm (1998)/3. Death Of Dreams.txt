I wake up in the morning... I see the news
Is this a TV, horror show
They talk Â´bout destruction
Hanger and wars
Another forest... burned out!

DonÂ´t you think we have to worry
About this problem!
The truth is worst than we thought
Is it real?
WonÂ´t we ever change our way?
Maybe itÂ´s not important
If we are dead or alive

Awake me from this "planet hell"
The signs are clear
They are leading us
To change the world
Our way I right

Now the time has come to pray
The evil has returned
The death of dreams
Now weÂ´ve got so little time
To realize and stop
The death of dreams

Like a rock to the ground
We keep falling day by day
No-one can stop us
WeÂ´re gods now
So... What lessons can be learnt?
To help ourselves from ourselves
To lead our lives into the light
ItÂ´s not so difficult to play the right game

The time has come
Evil returned
WeÂ´ve got so little time to realize
To stop the death of dreams
