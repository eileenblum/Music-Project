Sitting in the hall of stone
He waits for his time to come

Somewhere, lost in the Old World
In a place where earth meets the sky
Stands a âlone peakâ¦ in all of its might
Ravens above it
As black as the night
Guarding the peace of the one who resides in the tunnels
Deep down inside

Deep down inside
Where the dark reigns eternally
Where seasons never know change
A man of times long forgotten quietly waits
To take back his throne
And restore all that he left behind
Decades have passed since his exile
Yet fire still burns in his eyes

Years he spent in this desolate place
Amid the starless night
Alone in the dark, he watches and waits
With only a sword by his side
His black sentinels in the sky
For conquest and glory heâll soon fight again
The time to return is at hand

A dim light chases the darkness away
Heâs summoned back to his throne
The ravens are leaving their mountain home
No foe will remain in his way
Anguish, turmoil
Under one banner all lands will unite
Chains of the endless slumber are broken
Hail the return of the king
