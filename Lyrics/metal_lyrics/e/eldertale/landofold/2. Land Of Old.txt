Hear this tale of the Land of Old
Where legends come to life
Where wondrous beasts roam the forests and seas
And the Moon shines as bright as the Sun

Hear my tale of the Land of Old
Where only chosen dare to walk
And countless stars light the sky up at night,
Such a beautiful sight to behold

Gaze deep into the night and you shall see its secrets unfold
Falling into a world unknown

Show no fear, show no pain
Wither not in the cold and rain
You will never be alone anymore
Seek your shelter from the storm
Take a step inside the fire
Walk into the heart of the night
You shall find all that youâve been searching for
In the rays of the fading light

Hear the song of the fallen leaves
Being played by the wind
See the colors of the rain flow
Let your spirit fly free

Heed the call
Of the hunterâs horn
As it echoes in the night
While the fires are burning bright
Singing odes to the journeymanâs pride

Follow me into the Land of Old
See legends come to life
Free your soul from the chains of gold
And let freedom fill your heart

On these winding roads
Weâll walk forevermore
And meet many just like us
Along the way
By the mystic rites until the end of time
Our names shall be carved in stone
