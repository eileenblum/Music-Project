[music: Tobias Sammet/Jens Ludwig, words: Tobias Sammet]

The desert in the blazing sun
I feel my throat is burning
The guard is incorruptible
You name it vanity and yearning - oh

Now - dusty wind into my face
We gotta build it higher and higher
The sun god whipping from above
Your child in chains of desire

And craving towers
From the desert towards the sky
The grind of the genius
Who's raising his own decline

And the navigator is heading for hell
Setting off on a journey
And he'll never return
And the navigator he rose and the fell
In quest for heaven
He'll never return

Hey the seeker reaching for the stars
Beyond the scope of profanity
Oh and when he tried to touch the light
Fire burned his sanity away

Oh I gotta see it all
Tempting deities I hear them
But then when you follow their call
Pride goes before the fall

And the navigator is heading for hell
Setting off on a journey
And he'll never return
And the navigator he rose and the fell
In quest for heaven
He'll never return
