[Music &amp; words: Tobias Sammet]

I see an angel, fed up and pale
You've been a sleeper
You have been getting state my friend
Time to leave the vale again

Back on the runaway you accelerate
Get out of the tight spot and fly
Take your chance tonight
I'll give you a ride tonight

And as the sun is gonna rise
I'm gonna make you come alive

You can fly, reach for the sky
It's the rise of the morning glory
Scream and shout, cry it out loud
We are coming back to life
Now open you eyes
Witness the rise
Rise of the morning glory
When you're the next to me
You're gonna see...
Woahoo...

Everyday they're wounding your pride
Try to break you
And make you let go
The dreams you once have had
They'll never understand

There is a bastion that won't ever fall
Our passion, our magic, our fire
Let them run us down
I couldn't care less about
There is no time to waste
You better quicken up you pace

You can fly, reach for the sky
It's the rise of the morning glory
Scream and shout, cry it out loud
We are coming back to life
Now open you eyes
Witness the rise
Rise of the morning glory
When you're the next to me
You're gonna see...
Woahoo...
