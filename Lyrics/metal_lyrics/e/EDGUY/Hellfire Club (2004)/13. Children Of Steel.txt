I've had some tears falling like rain
Hiding from nothing and no one
and still Iâm feeling pain
feeling bitter pain
Bleeding for nothing, tortured to be kind
Liars and fear will be that you must
Leave behind -  leave behind

Iâm not gonna eat it Iâm striking back
Iâll show you the way of my life
Raise your fucking fists and then: Attack
We will never gonna cry

We are back, we are back, we are back
Children Of Steel
We are back, we are back, we are back
Weâre Children Of Steel

Tortured by teachers, eaten by the system
Chewed by those preachers, shot by the guns of society
Transforming to weapons I know you can tell
And if you donât like us then weâre gonna go back to hell hahaha

Weâre not gonna take it weâre striking back
Weâll show you our way of life
Raise your fucking fists and then attack
we will never wanna cry

We are back, we are back, we are back
Children Of Steel
We are back, we are back, we are back
We are Children Of Steel

Now canât you hear us cry
Children of the night
United we channel the power
And weâll be back to fight yeah

[Fiddle &amp; Classic Solo: Ludwig]

Iâm not gonna eat it Iâm striking back
Iâll show you the way of my life
Raise your fucking fists and then: Attack
We will never gonna cry

We are back, we are back, we are back
Children Of Steel
We are back, we are back, we are back
Children Of Steel

We are back, we are back, we are back
Children Of Steel
We are back, we are back, we are back
We are Children Of Steel
