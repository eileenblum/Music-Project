[Music &amp; words: Tobias Sammet]

A scent of rain
A healing breeze
Is blown into my face
To feel desire
And raise my head
To gaze at the sky
And watch the setting sun
Breaking through
The darkened clouds
And I feel that I
Am still alive an breathe

For all the world to see
You can bind my blood
But the spirit will remain

For all the world to see
No matter what you can claim
The spirit will remain

They wanna see me down
On my wounded knees
Wanna see me cry
But my eyes
Have run out of tears
When there's nothing left to pay
Just a little light of day
I got something
You can't take away

Fly away
Far away
Deep inside
Shelter for my spirit and my pride

For all the world to see
You can bind my blood
But the spirit will be free
Forevermore...
