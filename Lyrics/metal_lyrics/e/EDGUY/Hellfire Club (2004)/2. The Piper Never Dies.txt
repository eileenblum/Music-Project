[Music &amp; Words: Tobias Sammet]

Oh yeah!

Thirsting for salvation
You're off to find the stairway
Novice on you never ending ride
Whatever you may find dare to take it higher
Here's you instigation on your trip into the light

Standing at the temple
Where the wizard shall arise
You listen to the beauty of a song
A melody of promise calling from the dark
Tear down the portal and then go on and

Come and fly away with me
And you eyes are gonna see it all
And sleep with the fire - do you feel with me
Go obtain divinity, be the one you wanna be
And don't be afraid to give in

A ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies
Ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies

Entities are screaming, enticing from inside
Creatures you had never ever seen
And on the back of haughtiness
You leave into the light
The spirit on a mission in the shell of a beast

The ferryman is gentle
And promises are made
The other side may hold a lot to see
He's gonna take you over
And then he'll name the fare
Oh you gamble with the devil, fool
The ferryman is me

Come and fly away with me
And you eyes are gonna see it all
And sleep with the fire - do you feel with me
Go obtain divinity, be the one you wanna be
And don't be afraid to give in

A ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies
Ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies

Balance on the edge of day an night
Not afraid of falling
Time has come to see all wrong from right
Something's calling
Heaven and hell is it all the same
And just a different grade
Now I gotta know the point of change
Where love turns to hate

Balance on the edge of day and night
Dive into haze and kiss the light
Many of the tales you've been told
Never written for the brave an bold
Come and take my hand tonight
Come and sleep with me tonight
Certainly I'm gonna take you there
Showing you around everywhere

Oh...

Do you believe that you're devil-may-care
As you jump into the fire
Do you believe that you're devil-may-care
As you jump into the fire

Dreamer, dreamer, dreamer...

A ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies
Ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies
Ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies
Ride into the shadows
The piper never dies, never dies

You go on - into the night

Alright, the piper never dies, I got you hypnotised
Come with me and witness, see Babylon arise

The whore in fading light, let us step inside
I got you paralyzed child, the piper never dies

The pied piper play the song, beautiful but strong
He was never born, never he'll be gone

Oh the pied piper never dies
He never dies, never dies...
