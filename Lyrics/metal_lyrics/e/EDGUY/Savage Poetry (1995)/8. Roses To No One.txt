[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

I'm feeling this time as bad as never before
A bleeding wag is fading away
Once you needed me for spending delight
But below this funny mask there's a crying face
The way that I smile is the way that I cry
But you'll never realize
My reputation is the one of a fool
Now watch how a poet dies, hear a poets cries

And I dedicate my roses to noone
Cause there is no mind to help me to see
A reason we need, a light for the lonesome
And noone to drink the blood that I bleed

The poet inside wasn't given a chance
So he had to live apart
And I realized my best friend am I.
And not those parasites who
Try to stare into my heart

The way that I feel is the way that I heal
My body and soul and my life
And I know you just think I'm a fool
New watch like a poet flies, see him rise

And I dedicate my roses to noone
Cause there is no mind to help me to see
A reason we need, a light for the lonesome
And noone to drink the blood that I bleed.
