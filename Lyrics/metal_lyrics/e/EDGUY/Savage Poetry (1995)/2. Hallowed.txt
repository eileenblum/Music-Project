[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

Sacred - standing full of pride
Spite on my mind, spite in my brain, guiding me to fight
Enchained - you pray to be a slave
Rules without sense, no little sense, to dust you will decay

[Chorus:]
Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation you beg for damnation
Think you can serve me in hate?
Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation you beg for damnation
Hallowed be my name

Hatred - pushed into a war
Those who blaspheme
Don't join our way
Dying by your sword
Sacred - hallowed be my name
For peace you destroy
Lie and deny
A glorious crusade

[Chorus x3]
