[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

[Recorded by Harri von Bali for Harrikiri Sound Productions at Tonstudio 2000, Hilversum from April 1984 - September 1987.
The song tells the fictional story of someone who has this nightmare about receiving an immoral offer by a group of supposedly rich people who eventually turn out to be fake sheikhs.
The song is based on pure fiction, any resemblance to real FoH sound engineers called Aychim is purely coincidental.
Of course...]

You got an offer
That's what you told the masses in Swabia
For three million Deutschmarks 
You don't mind if broken your ass is

If sheikhing is strong (and snake in is lo)
And bogus the money (promises wrong)
And sheikh is pretending
Looking a lot like the fraud on TV
That they keep hunting for

Aychim - don't you let sheikh in
Swabia quaking - burning and aching

Aychim Coaler on fire
Flames burning higher
Wait to let sheikh in - Aychim

Now we know the stranger turned out
'Nepper, Schlepper, BauernfÃ¤nger' no
Insolvency is near, uh babe
So you produce Drimal Vear

Keep touring with Edguy of waiting for
You Kamel a lot and never know why
You are grinded by AC, heed the advice
Next time when sheikh rings
Don't tell the Edguys

Never open, Aychim! Don't you let sheikh in
Swabia quaking - burning and aching

Aychim Coaler on fire
Flames burning higher
Wait to let sheikh in 
King Kong On Fire

[Solo]

Aychim - Don't you let sheikh in
Swabia quaking - burning and aching

Aychim Coaler on fire
Flames burning higher
Wait to let sheikh in 
King Kong On Fire
