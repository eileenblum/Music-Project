[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

Seven seas crossed seven times at least
Back and forth we sailed to proselytize
We'll drag you over
A better world is waiting
At the end of what we're saying
Never failed to fertilize from Perth to Dover

Here we go:
Countless childhood dreams
Flaunted for the world to see
What a show!
Go where no man's been before
Yet we're charging open doors

We're defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crown

Have you heard the last words
Of the fallen-by-the-waysides
Such as "don't you ever leave the beaten track!"
A dirty job: it's Marshall arts
It's wicked through and through like me and you
Just another glass and then: Attack!

Here we go...

Here we go:
Countless childhood dreams
Flaunted for the world to see
What a show!
Go where no man's been before
Yet we're charging open doors

We're defenders of the crown
Were defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crownâ¦
And we also eat monsters!

We're defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crown
We're defenders of the crown

We're defenders of the crown
Of the crown the defenders we are too
We're defenders of the crown
Of the crown the defenders we are too

Hahahaha
We will eat you
