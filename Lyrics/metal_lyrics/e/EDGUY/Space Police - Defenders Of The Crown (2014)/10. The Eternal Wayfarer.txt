[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

Back in the day I never had to choose my way without a clue
No need for a hand
Unaware that I was dancing on the edge but wasn't a due
Oh, serene's the sea behind me
Into the whirl of devil time

A gentle rocking
Then a crack in the cradle
You're asleep until you hit the ground
One for this road and another for after?
Someone tell me: what's yer âafterâ all about?

From ease to the sky
Until the world gets in the way

Ring in the age: countdown to zero
Chasing the afterglow
The outcome is set as far as I know
Time and again the sundown it screams my name
But I try to run away

The gorge of the instant devours the future
To spit it out as a fading memory
Gimme the strenght to defy contradiction
When my mindset fails to let me see
Will I travel on and longing pave the road?

Ring in the age: countdown to zero
Chasing the afterglow
The outcome is set as far as I know
Is it the end or maybe the outset
Or just a stage of a whole that I can't survey
Time and again it's screaming my name

[Solo]

So you don't wanna see
You realize that your senses have come to the edge
And you don't trust a single one
Don't wanna turn your inside towards the sky
Are we afraid to catch a glimpse of truth tonight?

Could the heavens reveals
What's inside the afterglow?
Is this light just based on perception now?
Or do I refuse to perceive what is hard to ignore?
From ease through fire into afterglow...

And you don't wanna see
See that your eyes have come
To a point where you don't see why and where do you run
Will you turn your inside towards the sky
You're scared to death by what your heart may see tonight

Pictures of void burn in the afterglow
Purification or just a perception now?
Will refuse to feel what you can't ignore
From ease through fire into afterglow

I look up in search of forever and wonder
Trying to make out that day
That I had to give my inherent spiritual juvenility away and again:
Why is it made so difficult for us to read the signs that we
Have to read in order just to understand
Read so we can comprehend a trace of eternity

I look up in search of forever and wonder
Trying to make out that day
That I had to give my inherent spiritual juvenility away and again:
Why is it made so difficult for us to read the signs that we
Have to read in order just to understand
Read so we can comprehend a trace of eternity
Have to read in order just to understand
Read so we can comprehend a trace of eternity

Oh I feel like I'm to wander

I can't fathorn but I'm bound to journey on
Oh eternally I'll wander
I'm a spiritual eternal wayfarer, oh

I try to look as far as the eye can see
Past and beyond the dark painted wall, oh

Ring in the age: countdown to zero
Chasing the afterglow
The outcome is set as far as I know
Is it the end or maybe the outset
Or just a stage of a whole that I can't survey
Time and again it's screaming my name
