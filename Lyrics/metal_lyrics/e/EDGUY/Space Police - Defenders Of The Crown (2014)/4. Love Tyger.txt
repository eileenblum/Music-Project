[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

"What a cheek of the gods"
I thought when I'd hit the ground
But now that I'm here anyway - terrestrial-bound

(I) gotta make the most of causing this stir
Condescent to save the world
And turn it upside down

I'll shake it till my kingdom come

They call me Love T-T-Tyger
I'm gonna save your soul - never mine
Love T-T-Tyger - I'm gonna save your soul
There may be a lot who don't wanna be saved
I'm gonna save them anyway
Tonight the love tyger's gonna bite you tonight

Tobi or not to be! Motown-god, just in white
Evel Kneevil of Rock just without evil bike

I would break my nose to make a stir
Break a rib to save the world from choreography

I say a lot I must not say
And yet I get paid quite okay

They call me Love T-T-Tyger
I'm gonna save your soul - never mine
Love T-T-Tyger - I'm gonna save your soul
There may be a lot who don't wanna be saved
I'm gonna save them anyway
Tonight the love tyger's gonna strike tonight

[Solo]

Call me Love T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-Tyger
I'm gonna save your soul - never mine
Love T-T-Tyger - I'm gonna save your soul
There may be a lot who don't wanna be saved
I'm gonna save them anyway
Tonight I'm gonna purr and scratch and bite you tonight

T-T-T-Tyger
AT-T-T-T-T-tack of the T-T-T-T-Tyger
