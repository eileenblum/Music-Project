[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

An ocean of stars gleaming like diamonds
How many times have we wondered what lies behind
And how do you wish to make explorations 
And travel through space and time 
To the crest of forever 

Shoot up to life out there what will it be like? 
And if we're much faster than light maybe I can see 
What the shine of my ego looks like from a distance 
And what do they know about me in faraway solar systems?

Oh I dive in zero gravity 
A glance at the All 

We're riding out, pass by the moon
Bird's eye view on the universe 
We're all about breaking the rules 
"Freeze!" goes the space police 

"You're all about to make a fool of yourself" 
Goes the space police 
Cause you're about to negate their rules 
They're the space police 

Your visions caught speeding 
By free spirits that you recognize by the look 
Spacetrotting dissident freedom police 
Contrarians by the book 
Freedom and wisdom they guard from outside 
Stars and infinity shaking their heads at the force 
Into the black hole 

Oh what looked like zero gravity 
Is just a gelatinous mass 

We're riding out, pass by the moon 
Bird's eye view on the universe 
We're all about breaking the rules 
"Freeze!" goes the space police

"You're all about to make a fool of yourself" 
Goes the space police 
Cause you're about to negate their rules 
Watch out for the space police 

Space police 
Get me back on the straight and narrow 
Space police 
Law and order at the border to infinity 
Space Police 

Aaaaaah 
Aaaaaah 
Ahhaaahaaahaaaa Aaaaahaaahaaaahaaaahhaaa 
Aaaahaaaa hahahaha aaaah aaaahahaaaaaa 
Aaaahaaahaaa aahaaaaaaa 

We're riding out, pass by the moon
Bird's eye view on the universe 
We're all about breaking the rules 
"Freeze!" goes the space police

"You're all about to make a fool of yourself" 
Goes the space police 
Cause you're about to negate their rules
Watch out for the space police

We're riding out, pass by the moon 
Bird's eye view on the universe
We're all about breaking the rules
 "FREEZE!!! - SPACE POLICE!!!"
