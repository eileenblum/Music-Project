[Music: Ludwig &amp; Sammet, lyrics: Sammet]

The planets are shaking their heads at the earth
Oh what has become of their sister in blue
Don't be deterred, agent provocateur
As you parade while you know someone's aiming at you

People's backstreet ways fall into place
Tokens to be found
They track down lies, antagonize the decoy

âMake your choice!â
They wanna make you raise your voice to fight for a change
It's always the same
And what if this life is feeling like a world of bliss to you
And you don't feel like going against the grain today

I belive
Will you ever see them in the blinding light
To defy defiance and swallow evil
Here come the shadow eaters
I believe although you shouldn't watch them without safety glasses
They strike at sunrise â Angel squad
Here come the shadow eaters

One hundred seventy five zillion
And three thousand eight hundred and twenty nine lives
In history approximately
Laid at the door of Him who never knew and if He did
I'm not quite sure that He would quite have agreed

Backstreet ways â into place!
Tokens to be found
Track down lies, antagonize the decoy

They chase down grief to wallow in and make believe
You ain't gonna win whatever way:
We're all gonna die
Mean and sly
And somewhere in between there's life they say
But if we're not made to overshadow black?

I believe
Will you ever see them in the blinding light
To defy defiance and conquer evil
Here come the shadow eaters
I believe you don't see 'em with or without safety glasses
They strike at sunrise â Angel battalion
Here come the shadow eaters

[Solo]

I believe
Don't think you'll ever see them with your naked eye
And they're tired of showing off on demand
They are shadow eaters
I believe although we never see them
Cause they fly from reason
Tiny but forceful
I tell you, hmm, those shadow eaters
