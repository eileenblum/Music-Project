Are you the one who failed to listen to what the pundits say?
Don't hesitate to phrase desire
You fail to exercise prudence and passivity,
And you can't prove the tide, no!

We bid you welcome to a pageant of anomaly, we deliver dissaray
You fail to tell perception from reality,
But what's the difference anyway?

The devil you don't know sure ain't worn out,
Pick your poison with sabre and torch

Out the dark into the fire below
Out the dark into the fire below
Drawn to the light

You see that everyone's the only and the chosen one
A single drift in the flow!
In search of light they would approve to sacrifice the sun
And say: "it's just the way thing's go"

The sabre in one hand, the torch in the other.
Sharpen your wits! 
At the end of their way

Out the dark into the fire below
Out the dark into the fire below
Drawn to the light
