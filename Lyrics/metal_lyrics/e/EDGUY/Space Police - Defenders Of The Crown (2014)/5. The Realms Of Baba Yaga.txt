[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

You're wide-awake
Or is it a trick of the light?
You've been here before
But this is the night

Cries of temptation
You're content to lose your way
Jolly, what a jolly piece of folly and no way to defy

You can't wait to see what mortals they dare
Only to speak about in whispers of the dark

You're on the way that anxious have lost
Threatened by sanity
Reason laughs with vanity

Fiery moon in the sky
You can't wait to face it
Your heart is racing

Fiery moon paints the sky
You've entered the realms
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga

Razzle-dazzle
Mortar and pestle
Will you stand the ferocious look?
Deafened by the yelling
From a chicken legged dwelling
Frightening and earthy to those who ain't worthy

They won't stand the madness
And the ambiguity of her mind
Unravel the mystery of you will be history
You will be wined and especially dined

You can't wait to see what mortals they dare
Only to speak about in whispers of the dark

You're on the way that anxious have lost
Threatened by sanity
Reason laughs with vanity

Fiery moon in the sky
You can't wait to face it
Your heart is racing

Fiery moon paints the sky
You've entered the realms
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga
The realms of Baba Yaga
Baba Yaga tells me:
Will I have to dine with you tonight?

[Solo]

What's this about for heaven's sake
You wanna turn but it's too late
Your will is morphing into mania

Hahahahahahahaha

This ain't no fantasy no more
Senses your commands ignore
Just like the spirits that you've cited

Baba Yaga
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga
You've entered the realms of Baba Yaga Oh

Oh Baba Yaga
Oh Baba Yaga
Oh Baba Yaga
Oh Baba Yaga
