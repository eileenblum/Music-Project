[Music: Ludwig &amp; Sammet, lyrics: Sammet]

YouÂ´re letting go and try to fly away
To the slumberous voice of pouring rain
The inner agitationÂ´s dancing in your head
Will it ever end?

YouÂ´re all alone with coloured memories
Ungiving hotel without company
The ringing in your brain it starts to fade away
Fade away

Are you insane?

Walls come down
And then a ghostly voice
It sets up crazy moans into the night

Time and time again...
And you donÂ´t have a choice
But lie awake to verify

Did she really say
"Now do me! Do me like a caveman"?

It feels like no oneÂ´s ever there when youÂ´re in need
And no oneÂ´s ever gonna try to believe
The unforbearing walls are living to let it through
Whispering ghostly - right to you

Walls come down
And then a ghostly voice
It sets up crazy moans into the night

Time and time again...
And you donÂ´t have a choice
But lie awake to verify

Ground is shaking
The earth is quaking
And nobodyÂ´s here to testifly

Ghostly whispers in the night:
"Do me like a caveman!"

[Solo]

Walls come down
And then a ghostly voice
It sets up crazy moans into the night

Time and time again...
And you donÂ´t have a choice
But lie awake to verify

Ground is shaking
The earth is quaking
And nobodyÂ´s here to testifly

Ghostly whispers in the night:
"DonÂ´t waste time to hold tight
Like a caveman push inside!"

Ghostly whispers in the night:
"DonÂ´t waste time and come inside
Like a caveman take a ride!"
