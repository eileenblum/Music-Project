[Music &amp; lyrics: Sammet]

I'm trying hard to match the picture that you paint of me
You don't know how much I would give to really make you
See what I'm right here right now

I speak a word and then I feel like losing mother tongue
Aren't I grateless when you wanna make me feel
That I belong right here now

I'm alone in myself

There's many thoughts inside I whisper when I'm on my own
It may be strange but I can't phrase them right in front of you
Not right here, not right now

I'm walking down this lonesome lane and talk to dog and hope
That He'll be there to tell you all one day and let you know
What's inside me down here

I feel like this road that fades into the night
- Lit up by angels I fail to recognize -
Is paved with the words that I don't find

And I don't know my way
Got no sight of salvation
No matter how hard I pray I'm lost in translation
Ungrateful...
I run but I don't move
Alone in myself
Alone in myself

[Solo]

And I don't know my way
- I'm alone in myself
Got no sight of salvation
- No sight of salvation
No matter how hard I pray
- No matter how hard
I'm lost in translation

Ungrateful
I run but I don't move
Alone in myself
Alone in myself

I'm alone in myself
Alone in myself
