Waiting all the time to erase it from my mind
I feel like I've been left behind, my heart is frozen
Pushed to rush and fall and again I'm gonna crawl
Is there really no return from the life been chosen

You wanted more from me than I could ever be

Rain is falling, pouring down on me
Holy water to ease my pain, purify me
Rain is falling, pouring down on me
Holy water to ease my pain

I'm driving down my way to digest yesterday
Under rain clouds towards the sundown to be devoured
And then come out alive
Dripping wet but purified
Ready to bear the memories of golden hours

No, there's nothing else that we can do
We gotta walk on through

Rain is falling, pouring down on me...
