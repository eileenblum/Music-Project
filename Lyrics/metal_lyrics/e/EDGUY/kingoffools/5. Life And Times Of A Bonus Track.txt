Poor artist went to a label, truckloads of money in mind
Rich artist left the building
Cause all the labels had been standing in line
And so they signed

Artist wrote rock'n roll history
Concentrated on an album so strong
But business claimed limited editions
Insisting on additional songs

That was the time when I had been born
When I first saw the light of day
And even if you got a different opinion
From my point of view - needless to say -
That I'm happy to be
Even if you don't want me to be
The world wouldn't go round without me

I'm a bonus track on my way to Japan
And I'm gonna be spread on the Internet
I'm a bonus track, to Brazil and back
Enjoying worldwide fame

They'll screw the industry, pay no royalty
Burn me on CD, all illegally
Chinese bootlegs, Russian piracy
Cuthroat Germans they all copy me
And I don't give a shit, to me it's all the same
As long as I get all the fame
And the girls know my name

I don't give a fucking shit, no, I don't give a shit
Don't give a fucking shit, no, no...
Not a single little fucking shit
Oh this is it... This is it! It!
I'm a bonus traaaaaaaaaaaaack...
