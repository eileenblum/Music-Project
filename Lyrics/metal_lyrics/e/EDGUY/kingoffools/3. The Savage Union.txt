Here I'm standing at the junction of my life
So many ways, I don't know which one is the right
Do I wanna keep it up or throw it all away
Or close my eyes, go on and live just for today
I'm alive, I'm alive

We're gonna dive into madness of life
Heatstroke and nuts, don't live a lie
No one to blame, we don't play your game
We don't give a fuck, we're savage united
Savage united we stand!

Life is what happens to you while you're making plans
It's time to find your mental equilibrium again
Pedal to the metal and hit the passing lane
Kill the demons, cut the crap, quit their wicked game
I feel high, hell I'm high

We're gonna dive into madness of life...
