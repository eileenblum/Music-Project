City lights are calling
Slowly coming back to life
Speeding in the fast lane
Mama let us waste no time

Devil in the doorway
Selling any kind of hell
We're just coming out to play the game

[Chorus]
We never cry for love
We're superheroes
We are back where we belong
We never cry for pain
We're superheroes
Man can stand where he belong

Way to long I've tried to be
What I could never be
For too long you've rolled the dice
But you can't control me

I ain't talking 'bout romance
You may fit, a love may chance
Anyway it's a just game we play

[Chorus]
We never cry for love
We're superheroes
We are back where we belong
We never cry for pain
We're superheroes
Man can stand where he belong

We never cry for love
Man can stand where he belong
