Always tried so hard to leave a tragic story
It's tearing me apart you never really care
Never met with your approval from your higher category
Found life at killing pace and wanna have my share

I've been led to the water to lap up
So I'm not gonna dry out draining

[Chorus]
King of the mountain
Devil has taken my reason
I got spooks in the attic
We dance on the mountain
And pleasure replacing my reason
Got spooks in the attic

I'm a family kind of man I've lately started number ten
Too alien to find somebody home
Hyper salivation - hyper ventilation
Heading for the grail across the sea of lubrication
I'm out for it while rather on my own
Don't you see all the water so get down
If you don't wanna dry out draining

[Chorus]

There is no place for reason
Taking to the crest
And you won't go down in history with reason
And that stand no reason

[Solo]

[Chorus]
