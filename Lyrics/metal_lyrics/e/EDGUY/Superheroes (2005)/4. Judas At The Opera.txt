[These lyrics border on David Lynchiansim]

Darkness has covered the opera house
Something is wrong you can fell
There's a devil in disguise
A traitor has taken the dais
Catalogue people spend a pitying gaze
What can a man do in such a case
Aristocratic experts on art vomit all over the place

And they wish I'd be doomed eternally

[Chorus]
Forever French-frying
You'd love to see me dying
Wo's let the peacock in to
Rock the house - opera house
You want me French-fried and
You'd love to see me fired and
Then kill Judas in the opera house
Opera house

Huntsmen are rushing around
After the peacock oh no
The baton is pink and it's clear: He is a queer
He likes it into his rear
Rumors arise he is from outerspace
THey're out for the bounty
And still they're amazed
Aristocratic lemmings with a Highsnobiety leer

Get the chef to make peacock fillet steak

[Chorus]

We came from a solar system far away
Facing your goggle eyes
To protect this jolly bedlam from decay
Facing your goggle eyes
Who do you think you are
To think you're off a better class?
Who do you think you are
TO expect us to kiss your ass?

We've come to chase the monkey off your back
Facing your goggle eyes
And we're expected some may sound an attack
Facing your goggle eyes
Who do you think you are
To think you're of a higher class?
Who do you think you are
TO expect us to kiss your ass?

We're gonna be
Taking a chance - taking the chance
TO get you darting a glance - darting a glance
At us starting to prance - starting the dance
Of the oddballs

And you're invited

Taking the chance - taking the chance
To get you darting a glance - darting a glance
At us starting to prance - starting to dance
Of the oddballs

Frankenstein is out of control
Donkey has been given a soul
Flamboyantly he's playing his song
And they can't get it

The nuthead he is going insane
The screwball is igniting the flame
Pandora's box has opened behold
Madness rising

[Solo]

You say treason but I tell you
There ain't no reason
We just have our share
We don't care as long as we're alive
Love our sound and like to hear:

Where's the chef to make Judas-fillet-steak

[Chorus]
