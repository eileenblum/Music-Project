Don't place your trust in foolish promises sworn
Nor cryptic message scrawled upon every wall
Street corner justice beware
The spirit will find you always be fair
The shallow verse once read means nothing at all
Nor fearful gestures made for instant recall
In lies your heart will not share
The spirit inside used without care

[Chorus:]
The spirit that guides you follow it through
To the spirit inside you always be true
You know you'll despair
If the spirit inside is used without care

The battlefield of glory pales into rust
The river flows much thicker fed by each thrust
No beast alive does compare
The spirit beside you everywhere
Let not your head be turned by tainted reward
And dreams of fortune won forever to hoard
Your conscience could not repair
The spirit inside used without care

[Chorus]

[Solo ]

[Chorus]
