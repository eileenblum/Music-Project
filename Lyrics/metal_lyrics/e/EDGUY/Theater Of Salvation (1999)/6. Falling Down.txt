[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

"No brain is left but here I got one more nail!" 
The master's final word 
When he created a 'hero' like you 
Born to deride and to hurt 
You don't try to find a reason why 
You don't have a brain 
(You don't wanna have a brain) 
You are just a masquerade, just a nice facade 
In a snob parade, I know 
(You don't know) 

You don't have to wait, I'll be too late 
When you meet to jump off the edge 
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late 
When you meet to jump off the edge 

I'm not like you and I don't wanna be 
Follow the times to a place you can't see 
Don't call in doubt what the fashing may bring 
And you'll be falling down 

Hammer the nail into what you don't know 
Keep on believing you're strong 
You got your pride and I got my peace 
There's no sense in proving you wrong 

We will fight just to stand upright 
We are here to dare 
(We will fight, we are here to dare) 
Guts to sail against the stream, to defend the dream 
To do what we feel, I know 
(We will fight) 

You don't have to wait, I'll be too late 
When you meet to jump off the edge 
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late 
When you meet to jump off the edge 

I'm not like you and I don't wanna be 
Follow the times to a place you can't see 
Don't call in doubt what the fashing may bring 
And you'll be falling down 

Ooohhh 

You don't have to wait, I'll be too late 
When you meet to jump off the edge 
You don't have to wait, I'll be too late 
When you meet to jump off the edge 

I'm not like you and I don't wanna be 
Follow the times to a place you can't see 
Don't call in doubt what the fashing may bring 
And you'll be... 

(...they listen, they follow...and they fall...)
