[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet &amp; Jens Ludwig]

Faking the truth in their eyes 
Smile but they really deride 
Never give you shelter 
Lady all alone, naked to the bone 
Make you bleed and melt into tears 
Down on your knees you will see 
What you could be 
Raise the power in your eyes 
Make us rise to make us say 

Down and alone - arrows fly 
Breaking on my soul 
Down and alone - arrows fly 
I remember times 
When arrows hit me causing pain 
All alone I've found my soul 
And now my soul is sane 

The night has come down on the land 
I wanna reach out for her land 
But she takes another 
Lonesome in my room, staring at the moon 
Treated like a bother 

Down on my knees I have seen 
What I can be 
Raise the power in my eyes 
Makes me rise to make me say 

Down and alone - arrows fly 
Breaking on my soul 
Down and alone - arrows fly 
I remember times 
When arrows hit me causing pain 
All alone I've found my soul 
And now my soul is sane 

Down and alone - arrows fly 
Breaking on my soul 
Down and alone - arrows fly 
I remember times 
When arrows hit me causing pain 
All alone I've found my soul 
And now my soul is sane 

(...isn't loneliness a good reason to become acquainted with yourself? 
And when you're down and out - aren't you compelled to face yourself? 
And - if you know yourself - can the arrows of the world outside 
hurt you anymore?...)
