[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet &amp; Jens Ludwig]

I am the madness carrying the torch 
Lighting the wheat in your fields 
I am the eyes staring out of the dark 
I am the war of your yields 
When you give response away I grow 
I am more of you than you might know 

Burning down, burning down 
It's a story of deceivers 
Burning down, burning down 
Put the blame on the unbeliever 

I am the vision that comes to your mind 
When you denounce without regret 
"God" is the word in the bible you say 
I am the word that you spread 

When you give response away I grow 
I am more of you than you might know 

Burning down, burning down 
It's a story of deceivers 
Burning down, burning down 
Put the blame on the unbeliever 

I'm born and I lead the weak into the fire 
"No more pain" is what you claim 
While you have found your wicked desire 
Hahaha... 

Burning down, burning down 
Put the blame on the unbeliever 
Burning down, burning down 
It's a story of deceivers 

Burning down, burning down 
Put the blame on the unbeliever 
Burning down, burning down 
It's a story of deceivers 

(...and we still chase the evil - not realizing that it lurks inside of us...)
