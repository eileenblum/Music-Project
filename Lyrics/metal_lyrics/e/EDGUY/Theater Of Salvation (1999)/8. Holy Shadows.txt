[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

You're a child of an old illusion 
Can't you hear it cry? 
You live your life to the exclusion 
Of what they call a lie 
The touch of evil it is getting stronger 
You'd better hide in the daylight 
Or you won't stand the temptation no longer 
And you will ask if your way is right 

Do not ask the preacher why 
All your fears keep it alive 
Waiting for the end of time 

Holy shadows, always follow 
Holy chains on holy shadows 

When you are eve then I am temptation 
I am the words you're not allowed to say 
The animal of their revelation 
'Cause I can take your fears away 

They make you blind and they want you to follow 
"Free love is sin! Desire's slavery!" 
My wicked kiss on your virgin lips 
Will be a pleasant way you'll see it 

Do not ask the preacher why 
All your fears keep it alive 
Waiting for the end of time 

Holy shadows, always follow 
Holy chains on holy shadows 

Let's get down on the floor 
You'll be screaming for more 
When out bodies collide 
I'll make you feel alright 
Never give in when they call it sin 

Waiting for the end of time 

Holy shadows, always follow 
Holy chains on holy shadows 
Holy shadows, always follow 
Holy chains on holy shadows 
Holy shadows, always follow 
Holy chains on holy shadows 

(...father, forgive her for giving in to her lust, 
for being not able to stand the temptation...and for enjoying it!...)
