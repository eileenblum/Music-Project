[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

Soldier of sunlight 
Welcome to the kingdom of ignorance 
Where all the tears of ages tell their tales 
No one dares to break the spell 
No one dares to fly 
Time is running out you can't deny 
How many times 
Have you found yourself under the influence? 
How many times has a mirror mad you cry? 
Now it's time to stand upright 
Tear down your inner door 
The birth of yourself can't wait no more 

In your mind there's a battle raging on 
Try to find what you're fighting for 

Wake up the king 
From his sleep in your fantasy 
Wake up the king 
Let him be all you ecstasy 

Tears flow to rivers 
And rivers to oceans of broken dreams 
Have you ever heard of tears of joy? 
Show yourself a sense of life 
Open up your eyes 
Let your heartbeat be your best advice 

In your eyes I can see the fire burn 
Realize, now it is your turn 

Wake up the king 
From his sleep in your fantasy 
Wake up the king 
Let him be all you ecstasy 

Look at the mountain, look at the sun 
Feel all the pure energy 
Birds fly and whisper, call out your name 
They belong to you and you're the 
King of a kingdom, light in your hand 
Look at what you have never seen 
Walk on a rainbow, look to the stars 
Cry it out and make your dream come true 

Wake up the king 
From his sleep in your fantasy 
Wake up the king 
Let him be all you ecstasy 

Wake up the king 
From his sleep in your fantasy 
Wake up the king 
Let him be all you ecstasy 

Can't you see the crown? 

(...and the vision continued: "There is less sense in complaining than looking 
for your skills...")
