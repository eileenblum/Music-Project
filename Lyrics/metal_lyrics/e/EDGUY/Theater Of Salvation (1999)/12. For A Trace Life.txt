[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tobias Sammet] 

Don't know where I come from
Don't know where to go
Don't know if I know
What is good to be known

I wonder if madness
Is just a child 
Of my urge to know
The more that I ask
The more I get down

A million times 
My quest for life is pain
But still it has not made me going insane

And I long for more
For a trace of life
Tearing down all doors
For a trace of life

You tell me you wonder
If wondering is heaven or hell
You say that you've got the view
On the dark side of life

You can't see the shadows 
The others can see
But you can see it's well:
The sun and the day
The light in the sky

A million times 
Your quest for life has been pain
But still it is the key to make you sane
