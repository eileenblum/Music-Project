[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

The rain outside reminds me of your voice 
Like everything I hear since you're not there 
And distance doesn't leave me any choice 
Than to meet you in a dream we still can share 
In my dream I see your smile 
But when I open up my eyes 
I can't see anyone 
Now that you have gone away 
I wonder if we'll reach the day 
That you will realize that we belong 

I can't take it for granted 
I remember your smile 
I can't take it for granted 
'Cause I know that our life is in line 
For another day or life in another time 
In another time, in another time 

The pressure and the fear it made you blind 
You thought you have to give some burden away 
But are you really sure if it's required? 
Don't you want to find out another day? 

In my dream I see your smile 
But when I open up my eyes 
I can't see anyone 
Now that you have gone away 
I wonder if we'll reach the day 
That you will realize that we belong 

I can't take it for granted 
I remember your smile 
I can't take it for granted 
'Cause I know that our life is in line 
For another day or life in another time 
In another time, in another time 

I can't take it for granted - I can't take it 
I remember your smile - I remember 
I can't take it for granted - I can't take it 
'Cause I know that our life is in line 
For another day or life in another time 
In another time, in another time
