[music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

Longing for silence...  
"Always faster" is the way that we go. 
Not a little patience... 
Higher, farer, better we grow. 
The beast is rising. It?s tantalizing  
those who are taking the time. 
Alienation... A revelation... 
Straight to the end of the line... 

Fly! Riding away... Rising today... 
No we don't play your headless game! 
We are alive, don't say goodbye. 
Fly! Riding away... Rising today... 
No we don't play your headless game! 
We are alive, don?t say goodbye. 

Cast out from Eden... 
You don't like what we are in your eyes. 
We're leading the treason on the race you run, 
the way of your life. 

I am danger, I'm a stranger 
cause I don't give in to your call. 
And not until she is satisfied 
we can come and explode and we fall!!! 

We're blowing the frame of your headless game: 
We don't follow! 

(...In their eyes we are insane! But aren't daydreamers only the escapists of 
a soulless view of life?...)
