Awake by that dreams of you
Being all alone in the night
Coldness in my empty chamber
no one here holding me tight

I could take a masquerade
To show you I don't need to cry
But I can let my tears run away
To show you I'm as weak as a child

so many times you make me cry
But I got no reason to deny
Because I'm here and still alive

[Chorus]

When a hero cries, emotions arise
The tears in my face seem to be a trace of life
When a hero cries

It felt like heaven to me but it was nothing for you
You said that I should forget but it ran me through
And I still can't deny that you still make me cry

[Repeat]
