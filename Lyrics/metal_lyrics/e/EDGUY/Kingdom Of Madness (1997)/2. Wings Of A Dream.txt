This is my day - soldiers are coming to take me away
May justice be done
I hold on to pray but no god seems to hear me
The pain I will face is my price for disgrace
For things that I've never done

The toll of the bell and the flight of the raven
They open my cell and I feel it's too late
There's no need to yell they don't want to hear me
The morning has come
It seems like my work's been done.
Today I'll be the one

Sometimes it's good to be schizophrene
Cause when I'm close to the end I've got always a friend
On my lonesome way to the final decay
I listen to a voice telling me

[Chorus]

Now dream away - follow me astray
To a world that we can reach on wings of a dream

[Repeat]

I've got the key to the end of the nightmare
To leave all the dreams of bane and despair
The life I redeem has got the price of insanity
That you just can't get cause you're not even mad
You only trust in your eyes

[Repeat Solo: Jens]

Once upon a time there was a noble man like me
He only cared about the things he saw
One dark night without a moon he loved
The dog of his queen
Thinking it was her he enjoyed the life in the raw

[Repeat]
