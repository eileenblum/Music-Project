I've just returned to give you fears
To bring you pain as much as tears
You'll never know what's in my mind

It's an invitation to my way
Pray to me or you will pay
When I'm smiling what's behind

[Chorus]

I'll be tearing down you paradise
I'll be bringing you down
No warning - I'm pawning

[Repeat]

Now let us open up the gate
Leave your way before it's too late
Into the heart of dark insanity
As black as hate but even white
It must be the dragon that I ride
Something burning my reality.

[Repeat * Solo: Jens * Repeat]
