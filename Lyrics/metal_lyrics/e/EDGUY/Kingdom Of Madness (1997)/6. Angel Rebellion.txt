In the silence there's a fear
It's growing stronger with every breath I take
A fire inside that drives me mad
A haunt of darkness that makes me stay awake

But is it just a trace of evil
Or is it the force to bring me down

I feel like being chained by my noble reputation
I feel like being killed by a square and boring nation
It doesn't matter how but I know that I want out

Take a trip with me, stay a dream on brocken
Watch them play their game, no one here can stop it
Walpurgis night is closer than every holy day

[Chorus]

Right now I will set my life on fire
Now I'll satisfy my mad desires
Back into hell - Angel rebellion
Back into hell - Angel rebellion

[Solo: Jens * Both * Tobi * Jens]

[Repeat * Solo: Both]
