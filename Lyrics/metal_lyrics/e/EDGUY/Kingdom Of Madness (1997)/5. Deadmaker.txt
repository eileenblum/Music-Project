I can't feel, and I can't see
I'm falling down what's going on with me
Lord in heaven why am I here
Do I live to rise or rise to fall to shed another tear

One more time I fell that I'm alone
I can't describe it cause it's better to be shown
Feel the darkness covering the spite
Hear me screaming when it's pounding deep inside

Forever I'll be a poisoned thorn
I'll be haunting among your lives
The moment I was born it was time for him to rise

[Chorus]

Deadmaker, deadmaker
Why don't you realize
That he can paralyze you all

[Repeat]

My sorrow created by you
And even me cause I'm a self-destroying fool
I feel the spirit growing deep inside
I don't expect your comprehension
Cause even I don't know why

[Repeat Solo: Both Repeat]
