Huh!
What do you think when you smile into my eyes
You say that you like me but I know that's one of your lies
My love is abused my compassion misused
Cause I am too kind to despise, oh no

You hear me you see me and use me but you neglect
You like having me on your tail and show me your back
Why do we praise an illusion of grace
I know the way to survive
Standing to fight the love that misguides
The steel church is the savior of life

[Chorus]

Take me - take me to a church that accepts my hate
Take me - take me to a church of steel on steel
Take me - take me to a world I can lose my grace
Take me - take me to a hell of steel on steel

Maybe I`m evil but I take every chance
When I can get more there's no time to waste for romance
Show me how to maltreat to lie and to cheat
To fight steel on steel
Out of the light into the night
That is what I wanna feel

Much too long I really have been to kind
Can`t you tell me why could I be so blind

[Repeat * Solo: Both * Repeat]
