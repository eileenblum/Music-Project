Tell me why can't I understand
The feelings deep inside
Why do I try to scratch away the stains
Deep in my heart I feel there's a place
Where love and hate collide
But is everybody who asks for reasons
Destined to go insane

I don't know if I'm right or wrong
The heart of twilight is much too strong
Leaving the pride so I'm stopping to stride
I only dare to hide

[Chorus]

Dying, dying! My mind is what I've lost
My head is dying cold
Dying, dying! My mind is what I've lost
The heart of twilight knows

An old illusion of understanding
Is fading day by day
The apparition of a future vision is black
Everytime I dive in depressions
The colors of life are grey
Father forgive me if I decide to come back

[Repeat * Solo: Jens * Repeat]
