God, oh please bear with me, as you`re looking from above
Elementary question: what do you take as love?

Badlands all around me, I got animal inside
God oh please forgive me for my sins
And for I enjoy this ride

Woe to you o earth and flood
For the devil sends the beast
Tell your dreaming son about the rain to come
Make him rescue us by sea

Creeping, crawling on all fours
It`s down to push and shove
The juggernaut is full, let`s close the doors

And the ride is on
Wastelands are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, fly by the stars
Pandora`s Box is under weigh

Turmoil on the pleasure boat, the pigeon can`t be seen
Look! The serpent`s shape bespeaks: the problem lies within

On this sea of sadness, unknown destination sought
But we cross your shady ocean on our Yacht

And the ride is on
Wastelands are waiting to be found another day
Ride across the ocean, we fly by the stars
Pandora`s Box is under weigh
