Waiting up all night
I am lying by your side
I can't close my eyes and slowly dream away

I so need to feel you near
The sight I'd see, the breath I'd hear
Watching till the break of day

Long cold nights
I had to stumble through in a lonely life
Wind and rain till you walked inside

Every night without you I'd sail on
Don't know how I'd make it through without you
Every night without you, my angel
Pity for the zillions around
Who're every night without you

It's not always easy to find the words I need
And tell you all the things I really feel

But watching you beside me
The silence tells the truth
We know that it's forever and for real

Long cold roads
I had to stumble down in a long gone life
Wind and rain and you walked inside

Every night without you I'd sail on
Don't know how I'd make it through without you
Every night without you, my angel
Pity for the zillions around
Who're every night without you
Every night without you

I ran around guided by the neon signs
I burned the candle at both ends
Why would we die for the things we've never lived to see
Striving for peace of mind

[Solo]

Every night with...
Every night without you I'd sail on
Don't know how I'd make it through without you
Every night without you, my angel
Pity for the zillions around
Who're every night without you...
