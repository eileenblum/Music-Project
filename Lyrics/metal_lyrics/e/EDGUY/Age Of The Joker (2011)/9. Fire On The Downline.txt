No... no time to ponder
Take your feet in your hands, swept by the sea
Oh it's too late to wonder where we went wrong
There's no time to win, to lose and to feel

Cries... they go unsung
Memories of plenty fading away
Cries of dying dreams
Where will they run to when there's nowhere to go?

See them kids worn-out and pale
To the Promised Land they're drawn
All the way with a dream that turned into fear

To the other side where the wild winds blow
And the golden rivers flow
They've come all the way for survival
A long trail of tears

Take a look into the eyes of confusion
They carry the torch into the sea of delusion

Fire on the down line
It's the way of the world
Always out to find another dime
Fire on the down line
The game is on

To the evil above you crawl
While you're floundering and kicking around
The wheel of days and nights and no time to sleep

To the other side to one storey higher
Where one less digit is your name
Dying to live one more sunrise, defying fatigue

Throw yourself into a final illusion
See them dive into the tide of the grain

Fire on the down line
It's the way of the world
Always out to find another dime
Fire on the down line
The game is on

Fire on the down line - Fire!
It's the way of the world
Always out to find another dime
Fire on the down line
The game is on

[Solo]

Fire on the down line
It's the way of the world
Always out to find another dime
Fire on the down line
The game is on
Fire on the down line - Fire!
It's the way of the world
Always out to find another dime
Fire on the down line
The game is on
