There in the distance
You don't see anything
And anything is what keeps me alive

I am the mess inside your mind
I am the black behind the light
I'm the tail of the glowing ball
That drowns in the horizon

I trail the setting sun
I'm every cold, cold night
The last one by your side

I am the face in the night
I make you open your eyes
Every time you lay yourself to sleep
I am the beat in your veins
I'm the worm in your brain
I'm the one to make you start
Form your dreams

Where do you go from here
When nighttime is drawing near
You ain't gonna run, run, run...

When you open your eyes
You'll see them smile
Faces in the darkness
When you wake up from your dream
To burn the nighttime
Faces in the darkness

You hear the noises of the day
You hear them slowly fade away
And you're the only one sensing time again and again

Where do you go from here
When nighttime is drawing near
You ain't gonna run, run, run...

When you open your eyes
You'll see them smile
Faces in the darkness
When you wake up from your dream
To blame the nighttime
Faces in the darkness

Afraid of the night

[Solo]

When you open your eyes
You'll see them smile
Faces in the darkness
When you wake up from your dream
To burn the nighttime
Faces in the darkness
