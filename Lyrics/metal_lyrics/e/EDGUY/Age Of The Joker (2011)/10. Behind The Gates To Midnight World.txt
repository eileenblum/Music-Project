Born alone, tiny soul
Unknown looks to face from all around
Caught in space and time

A new apparel, different name
We got another stowaway
In life and who's to blame
What a beautiful day
Given birth to be a shame like you
Just another you
Just another fool in the game
Welcome to this place

Starry eyes by the night
Come the first ray of light
You won't find anymore
What you could have seen before

Starry eyes you'll deny
You could read till you were
Leaving the gates to midnight world behind you

Wash away the innocence
On this boiling road to Calvary
Bloodstains on the streets

Blistering me you scourge yourself
Crucify that stowaway in life
That we can blame
Oh what a day

Given birth to be a shame like you
He's me and he is you
Just another fool in the game
Welcome to this place

Starry eyes by the night
Come the first ray of light
You won't find anymore
What you could have seen before

Starry eyes you'll deny
You could read till you were
Leaving the gates to midnight world behind you

[Solo]

Eyes - a face in the window
Through the looking glass, staring at you
Eyes - and they seem to follow
As relenting gestures they follow your every move

You wanna run
But you can't move away from what you see
In rigour you're frozen with open eyes
Lame - is it one of those dreams in which your body's numb
While you can't turn a blind eye to fear

Running away, running away from his own reflection
Crossing the line, watching the primeval revelation

Running away, running away from the pain of insight
No running away, running away
It is going to fetch you
You just go ahead and close your eyes

Starry eyes by the night
Come the first ray of light
You won't find anymore
What you could have seen before

Starry eyes you'll deny
You could read till you were
Leaving the gates to midnight world behind you
