Alright!

When they'd found him without name
He was cries resounding from the waste
He'd been thrown away

He'd never speak but he could see
Eyes of a child and certified insane
Sent down a tearful lane

Coming out of nowhere
No past and no way to go
His final drops of pride make the show go on

Running from the sun: Nobody's Hero
Figures down the drain to hunker down in shadows
Running from the sun: Nobody's Hero
Down the boulevard of unborn dreams

A little odd but then okay
On rally tracks until she went astray
Got lost along the way

All the knew: You gotta run
They found the treadmill but she was gone
Her smile to chase

Fly into the darkness
No past, no future to come
Final drops of pride make the show go on

Running from the sun: Nobody's Hero
Figures down the drain to hunker down in shadows
Running from the sun: Nobody's Hero
Down the boulevard of unborn dreams

[Solo]

Nobody's Hero
Figures down the drain to hunker down in shadows
Running from the sun: Nobody's Hero
Down the boulevard of unborn dreams
