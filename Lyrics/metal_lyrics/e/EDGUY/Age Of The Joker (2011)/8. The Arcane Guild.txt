Rain pouring down from
Beyond this grey shroud of mystery above
The goblet of memories is filling
Yet it can't appease your thirst for love

Salutation - invocation of the light
Of a spark to ignite

Tie the will and watch your dream
Tie your thoughts and they'll convene
The guild of ages
Tie your will, align your mind
Let them raise the blind
The guild remains arcane
In the eyes of this world

Out in the cold you turn inside
You're aware of the sacred tie
Watch: as above so below
You feel us standing by your side

Salutation - invocation of the light
Of a spark to ignite

Tie the will and watch your dream
Tie your thoughts and they'll convene
The guild of ages
Tie your will, align your mind
Let them raise the blind
The guild remains arcane

The guild remains arcane
