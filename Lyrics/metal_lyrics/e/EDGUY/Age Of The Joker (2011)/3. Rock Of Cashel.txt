Crossing these endless graze lands
The rain wants to cloud remains of longing
Or am I done becoming

You say That life will go on
Then you confine your heart to beating
While you keep on cheating

The road you left behind
A thousand partings of the way
They've tried to cloud your mind
The pilgrim shall betray his cause

High rise up the sky from the emerald
Rock of shelter
High rise kissed by the breeze of creation
Rock of Cashel

You leave that horizon behind
Lime stone and green: your finest hour
Magic will devour the cross you carry

Scales falling from your eyes - yeah
The mysteries of yesterday unfolding
The grace that you're beholding

The skyline you have chased
Time and again you fought the clouds
Been spinning but the
Wheel of Dharma wouldn't let you out

High rise up the sky from the emerald
Rock of shelter
High rise kissed by the breeze of creation
Rock of Cashel

[Solo]

High rise up the sky from the emerald
Rock of shelter
High rise kissed by the breeze of creation
Rock of Cashel
