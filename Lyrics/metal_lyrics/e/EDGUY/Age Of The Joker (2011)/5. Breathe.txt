Tide me over
Tide me over only one more night
To a world of make-believe
It's the diamonds and not the dusty rainbow

That we ride across the wreckage of a dream

Analogies in time,
You are chasing on your stony way
Run from decay, while the bends seem recondite
There'll be myriads of tomorrows to make yesterdays

You've gotta burn another day
Kick the diamonds down the road
It's only one more night away

And then another day to kill
But no time left to spill, no

I'd die for a breaking wheel
I'd die for a break to feel
I better stay in the realm of shades
Falling, falling
God gimme a broken wheel
God gimme some air to breathe
I need just one break to breathe
Only just one break to breathe

The fast lane advertised
We cry up the love that falls by the wayside
And glorify the stride
We idolize the comforts of life: Sign of the times

You gotta die another day
Kick the diamonds down the road
It's only one more night away

And then another day to kill
But no time left to spill, no...

I'd die for a breaking wheel
I'd die for a break to feel
I better stay in the realm of shades
Falling, falling
God gimme a broken wheel
God gimme some air to breathe
I need just one break to breathe

[Solo]

And as we're gazing at the stars
One the balcony
We wonder where they lost the way

Another mood another wine
A final felony
Watch the world in disarray

Crash team racing

No time to turn apologize
For I need a second to breathe

I'd die for a breaking wheel
I'd die for a break to feel
I better stay in the realm of shades
Falling, falling
God gimme a broken wheel
God gimme some air to breathe
I need just one break to breathe

I'd die for a breaking wheel
I'd die for a break to feel
I better stay in the realm of shades
Falling, falling
God gimme a broken wheel
God gimme some air to breathe
I need just one break to breathe
Only just one break to breathe
