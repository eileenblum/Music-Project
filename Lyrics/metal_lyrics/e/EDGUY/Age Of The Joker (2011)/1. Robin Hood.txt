Ride across the endless woods
Shadows guide our way
Whispers from the fallen leaves
We've sworn to spare no pains

Moonlight falling through the boughs
When horses crump afraid
The tassel sounds revealing
As we shiver and we shake

Make no sound and rowel
Run for your lives
Run from the cries
Out of the dark of the damned lands

Your day to die
Robin Hood is after you
And he's not in a joking mood, no
You ride or die
He's out for bling again

Courting maids in hundreds
They say there's merry men and wine
You dream of what he does all day
What a folly life

He never shaves to show his face
Legend has that all he does all day
Is shooting, ducking and running from the law

Liberty, equality and a little love
Women, wine and song for every outlaw

Throw in some jealousy
And a pinch of need for fame
The king for every one
Who wants to be the same

Make no sound and rowel
Run from the cries
Run for your lives
Fly from the son of an arrow

Your day to die
Robin Hood is after you
And he's not in a joking mood
So you ride or die
He's out for bling again

[Spoken:]
Robin Hood,
King of thieves
Hero of outlaws,
Son of a father
Bewareth! He may be after you!
Bewareth! Ha ha ha ha ha!

[Solo]

The legend is a mile down the road
To blind the honest man
While the truth hasn't even the boots,
Its boots on you

Take what you desire
Make no mistake
Fire and duck! Fire and duck!
Let nemesis prevail

[Solo]

Stab in the back
Stab in the back
You will never see his face
Fire and duck!
One more stab in the back
What a day to kill disgrace

The legend is a mile down the road
To blind the honest man
While the truth hasn't even its boots
Its boots on yet

Make no sound and rowel, hahaha
Run for the cries
Run from your lives
Fly from the son of an arrow

Your day to die
Robin Hood is after you
And he's not in a joking mood, no
You ride or die
He's out for bling again

Your day to die
When Robin Hood can't find no one
Who would caress his Little John
You ride or die
He's out for bling again
