I see your face in a masquerade
I see your made up smile
When the show is over, then what is left behind?
It's in your eyes, it's in your hair
How come they say opposites attract?
When all you feel is a struggle deep inside?

Don't tell no lies, no more disguise
I'm tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done, you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix

I'm feeling pushed, from left to right
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Is my destiny crawling on my knees?

Now who is right? And who is wrong?
Who is the one that won't belong?
Who is for real? And who's just pretending to be?

Don't tell no lies, no more disguise
I'm tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done, you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
No more lies, no more disguise
Into the matrix

No more lies, no disguise
I'm tracing the matrix
No more...

Lies, no more disguise
I'm tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done, you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
No more lies, no more disguise
Tracing the matrix of my life
The damage is done, you don't belong
Deep down in the matrix
Into the matrix
