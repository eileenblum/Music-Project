You ride the spinning wheel that's gotten faster
Outside they saw the passing centuries

Round and round, merry-go-round, round and round you go
Scream and shout, laugh aloud

So out of vogue
To lead a way outside the catalogue
You're in vogue - you don't understand
So out of vogue
To contradict the trend, the mistress of the world
How does it feel in your cage?
Trapped in vogue

So you don't miss a thing in your carousel
You feel so proud behind the steering wheel
Don't mind your soul has set you from outside
When you feel happy as you kneel

Lady Dark, crack the whip - 300 pounds of lust
What you get, what you need

So out of vogue
How do you do inside the catalogue?
You're in vogue - you don't miss a thing
So out of vogue
To contradict your trends, the mistress of the world
How does it feel in your cage?
