The dream is over, no one's to take the blame
We believed in roses, but only thorns remained

When I look into the rear view mirror
We create and we destroy
Put our blood into a street with a dead end
Walk up that stairway to jump off into the black
Here we go

We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all wasted again?
We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all just wasted time?

Maybe I am different, maybe I'm a fool
And I wonder if it's worth it, trying to find another you

And I look into the rear view mirror
Just to see how fucked I look
While I drive along that street with a dead end.
Like a moth to the flame
It's gonna suck me into pain
Still we go

We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all wasted again?
We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all just wasted time?

What are we heading for?
What do I dare again?
Once beaten, twice shy
And still we haven't learned

So here I'm lying
A leisure-poet in pain
Involuntary loner
I know that life is just a game

But nobody gets out alive
A sedative shot for me
No happy man gets out alive
Neither of us you will see

We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all wasted again?
We go all the way, do we need the pain?
Waking up in a black tomorrow
I've been there before, was it all just wasted time?
