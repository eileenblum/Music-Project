I saw her coming in high-heels, living like a queen
A little sweet angel, but deep underneath a mean machine
You're lying and wait to make me your fool, you want me to bite
I'm gonna take the bait and the hunter for afters, take you for a ride

And I don't wanna play no games 'cause I'm a bad, bad boy all around
Let me be your Titanic, for you know what's going on - I'll make her down

Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've been gone with the hairforce one

I don't make no mistakes so don't you miss out on a hell of a time
I'm a real go-getter, that's no doubt, down the line
I know what you want and I know what you need, your secret desire
Got the gloves of a man - the hands of a beast, and the pants on fire

And I don't wanna play no games 'cause I'm a nasty, bad boy all around, 'round
Let me be your Titanic, for you know what's going on - I'm going down. I'm...

...Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've been gone with the hairforce one

Honey you know what?
You know what I am...

...Fucking with fire - I'm coming to rock
Got my rocket on fire and I take what I want
Fucking with fire - loaded and cocked
You never miss it 'til you've been down with the hairforce one
