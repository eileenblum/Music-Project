Too much time to get lost in the maze
Tell me, isn't that strange?
You bleed to get there, you were ready
You were ready, to be a bird in a golden cage

Sweat is breaking on my brow
Where's the freak to ease my pain?
The room is dark and big and empty
Silence drivin' me insane

Night has fallen, demons laughing
Waiting for the light of day
Here's the land of milk and honey
There you got the price to pay

Searching for shelter
Riding the pendulum to paradise
As I'm reaching higher
What a pure desire
Swinging back towards the edge

When I drift away killing sacrifice
Here I go insane
What a price to pay, living sacrifice
I set off to Heaven, and found bedlam

There's a part of me that has not been sold
Save me please, embrace me, hold me
And kiss my bleeding soul

You can see below the creature
Pounding, sitting in my neck
If you'd see inside my head
You surely wouldn't turn your back on me

I'm looking for shelter, riding the pendulum to paradise
As I'm reaching higher, what a pure desire
Swinging back towards the abyss

When I drift away killing sacrifice
Here I go insane
What a price to pay, living sacrifice
I set off to Heaven, and found bedlam

Nothing remains the same, but still I hear those voices
Nothing remains the same, where am I gonna go?
Is it my destination, or just a fake temptation, baby?
I remember home, when demons came and I got swept away
From me

When I drift away killing sacrifice
Here I go insane
What a price to pay, living sacrifice
I set off to Heaven, and found bedlam
