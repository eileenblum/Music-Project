Road lies ahead
And a long road lies behind me
See lights passing by
And I know it's the time of their lives

A million miles, light years I've been traveling
To watch and enjoy this world
That I've seen as galore

Oh amusing over it all
Closing my eyes to remember it all
Embracing the past and the future to come
Kiss that road that leads me to my tribe

I've found my way home
I've returned to where I belong
Back to where I stand from
Back to paradise
Time to return to the tribe

The other side, always close to the edge
Been walking a thin line, always had someone watch my step
A mystery, to make it out alive and say
The battle is over, and I know who's been with me

Now amusing over it all
On top of this world I remember it all
Awaiting the sunrise and sunset (something)
Kiss the way that leads me to my tribe

Back to the tribe
I've found my way home
I've returned to where I belong
Back to where I stand from
Back to paradise
Time to return to the tribe

Back to the tribe
I've found my way home
I've returned to where I belong
Back to where I stand from
Back to paradise
Time to return to the tribe
