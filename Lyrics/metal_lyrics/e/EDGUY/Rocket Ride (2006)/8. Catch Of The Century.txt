You do not know, and you don't care
And you may never learn
I made approaches, you gave me teeth
And got my open heart

I'm paid for sassing, that's what you say
Don't get the essential point
What it came down to, was you and good nothing
Here's to the wicked and here's to the odd

You got your chance going down the drain, you're dumping
The catch of the century
You've got your chance, but you're much too vain to take it
The catch of the century

Your bodies waiting, cause all the world is already spoken for
A host of rivals, I'm out for boogeying and I'll be forever more
You spread all around, sniff while I'm high, I'm on the road again
I'm going down with flying colors, before I go down on someone else

You got your chance goin' on my train, you're dumping
The catch of the century
And lady luck's got her ass in pain, you're wasting
The catch of the century
You got your chance goin' on my train, you're dump
The catch of the century

"I tell you, one day you will regret it
I will sell millions of records
I'm gonna have hundreds of women
Seven, seven Ferraris!
A private jet!
A helicopter license!
I'm gonna be the Formula One world champion!
I'm gonna have a big house in Hollywood Hills!
And you will be nothing
Nothing! Nothing! You will be nothing but nothing!
AAAAAHHH! AAAAAHHH! YOU! NOTHING! NOTHING, YOU'RE NOTHING!
HELICOPTER!"

"Tobi, so ist es gut?"

"Gut?"
