Lying in the still of the night
A yearning for shelter
Silence kissing your wounds, soothing your pain
Darkness, and what do they know
'Bout losing direction, clutching a straw
Cherish the hope to make it finally home
Home, home, home, home

You long to be see-through, so nobody can tell
Whenever they make you bleed your pride away

Now you're driven by one track mind, initiating you
Splendid flowers, blossom from the wounds
The strong of the poison, sweetest as the bloom
Don't you try to stand your ground
'Cause you're only coming home

Through the heart of fire
You're home, found the asylum
In a world where the broken dance on shards of glass
I see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
In a world where the broken dance with shattered dreams

It's burning inside you, it's emotional hell
And you keep on smiling, upon the icy tides
A stream of fire, to sweep the fears away
Seems like forever, too long you've had to wait
Locked in darkness, for wicked harmony
Little angel thrown away, she'll be back another day

Through the heart of fire
You're home, found the asylum
In a world where the broken dance on shards of glass
I see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
In a world where the broken dance with shattered dreams

Now see the coma children, I see them off the beaten track
Embracing and crying
Come seek humiliation, now let them dance
Liberation, cruelty free,
Dancing towards the gallows-tree.

Boogeyman was sought and found
Boogeyman has found a home

In the heart of fire, he's found the asylum
In a world where the broken dance on shards of glass

Fire, ruins and fire, and fire
In a world where the broken dance with shattered dreams
Heart of fire, you're home, found the asylum
In a world where the broken dance on shards of glass
I see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
In a world where the broken dance with shattered dreams
