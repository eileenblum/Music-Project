I sought salvation but I found insanity
Lost in a mass I returned to profanity

I've been reaching for the sky
But I am stuck with my feet, down in concrete

Don't you run away now, don't you be afraid
Now there is a meaning, whoah oh oh
Don't you run away now, don't you live a lie
There's more to life to show you, take a rocket ride

Suffering my way with divine aspiration
I failed to resist the sweetest temptation

Been stuck to religion 'till I clung to the pie
You never really miss it, until you really try

Tried to jump but I'm down by concrete
The memories surrounding my fate (faith?)

Don't you run away now, don't you be afraid
Now there is a meaning, whoah oh oh
Don't you run away now, don't you live a lie
There's more to life to show you, take a rocket ride

I've tried to reach higher, but my flesh is too weak
I've been searching for answers, I been led to the fire
There must be a reason for us to be down here
I'm drifting, yeah temptation, carried out to the sea
I'm drifting, I'm drifting away, I'm drifting away

I've been reaching for the sky
But I am stuck with my feet, down in concrete

Don't you run away now, don't you be afraid
Now there is a meaning, whoah oh oh
Don't you run away now, don't you live a lie
There's more to life to show you, take a rocket ride
