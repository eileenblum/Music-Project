"Let me tell you a story about an ugly woman I know..."
"Hello Girls!"
"Hello Tobi you hot little machine!!!"

I'm a sight for sore eyes
Oh, if your eyes would only see
I've been born on tiptoe
Still you looked
like a lighthouse next to me

You pet named me Napoleon
I was proud
'til I got the reason why
Never aimed for confrontation
You've been sleeping
when I kissed your ass goodbye

Oh, while you read this letter
I'd just gone to eat out
By the way:

My what a sunshine in Trinidad
Hope you're okay light years away
My what a heat wave in Trinidad
Hope you don't mind if I stay

Pitcher goes too often to the well
And now the Pitcher's gone insane
(Ratatatataa) - gotta run away
boiling over - getting hell
And found the answer on a plane

Oh, I've been pissing off
Before you might
could have pissed me off
I hope you're fine, yeah

My what a sunshine in Trinidad
Mind if you stay? I do okay!
My what a heat wave in Trinidad
Sunburned a night flight away

"Honey you're looking good so far away from me
The weather is great, the beach is great, the food is great
Everything is great and you're so far away, I love you honey
Greetings from Trinidad, hey!"

My what a sunshine in Trinidad
Mind if you stay? I do okay!
My what a heat wave in Trinidad
Sunburned a night flight away

"Back and home in Germany I was a famous porn star, hahaha"
