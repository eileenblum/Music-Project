[Music &amp; words: Tobias Sammet]

Oh if only Brazil was not so far
Far away I would swim or walk or ride
But never ever fly
But all the noise of the maniacs there
The seat on my face it's worth to bear
But I don't wanna bounce and die

But then I see a lady in a tight blue dress
I close my eyes, I know what I would go for
Stewardess before the crash

Lavatory love machine
No fear can quell my steam
Lavatory live machine
No cabin fire burn my dream

I'm at you disposal
I gotta get up to see what you ain't gotta hide
Wheeling junk along the aisle
Keep your seat belt fastened
You're whipping with an iron voice
You command
Uh mistress I am in your hands

And when she asks me what I'd like to eat
I realise the domina feels the same
And I reply... What about your pie?

Lavatory love machine
No fear can quell my steam
Lavatory live machine
No cabin fire burn my dream

Lavatory love machine
No broken wings to stop me stream
Lavatory love machine
Honey do you like the way I cream?!

Now if I gotta die
I'll have been stiff and smiling till the crash
Let them know I've been alive
Till I made my final splash

Lavatory love machine
No fear can quell my steam
Lavatory live machine
No cabin fire burn my dream

Don't hear those scary noises
From the turbine when you scream
