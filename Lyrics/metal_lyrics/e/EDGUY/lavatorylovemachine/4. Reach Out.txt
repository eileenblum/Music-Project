When the spotlight is fading
And everyone's gone
When your thoughts come back to life
And you think of what you have done

Take a look in the mirror
And then look to the past
Tell me who you are
And then tell me what's gonna last

And as you take off your disguise
As you dare to open your eyes

To behold the panacea
Embracing your life
Oh, and then you realize

You gotta reach out
To find it all inside of you
As the spotlight fades away
You gotta reach out
To find it all inside of you
And let that spotlight fade away

It's so hard to escape from
Where they say you belong
If they say don't you break the rules
You just got to bend them and then go on

And there won't be anything missin'
There won't be no grief or regret
Oh, let the child inside break free
I'll find the time to be stiff when I'm dead

Don't wanna be trapped in a disguise
I want it all and I wanna rise

And I dive in the panacea
Embracing my life
Open my eyes

Reach out!
To find it all inside of you
As the spotlight fades away
You gotta reach out
To find it all inside of you
And let that spotlight fade away
Reach out!
Find it all inside of you
As the spotlight fades away
Reach out!
Find it all inside of you
And let that spotlight fade away
