[Europe Cover]

Never deamed that I could fall
But something's come over me
Now I'm sitting staring at the wall
Afraid for my sanity, yeah

The sound of your voice
The touch of your skin
Is haunting me, haunting me
I still try to come to my senses
But it's too late now
So I'm taking my chances

I wanna give you my heart
Give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms
Never let go
Don't wanna live my life without you
But I know when you're gone

Like a fire needs a spark
Like a fool in the dark
Honey, I'll cry for you

Wondering why I'm running scared
From what I believe in
I know that love is just another word
To say what I'm feeling

For once in my life
The future is mine
It's calling me, calling me
I've been searching so long for an answer
But it's too late now
So I'm taking my chances

I wanna give you my heart
Give you my soul
I wanna lay in your arms
Never let go
Don't wanna live my life without you
But I know when you're gone

Like a fire needs a spark
Like a fool in the dark
Honey, I'll cry for you

I wanna give you my heart
Cry for you
I wanna lay in your arms
Cry for you
I wanna give you my heart
Cry for you
I wanna lay in your arms
Honey, I'll cry for you now
