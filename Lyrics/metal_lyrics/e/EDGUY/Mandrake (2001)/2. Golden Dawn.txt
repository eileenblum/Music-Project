[Music: Sammet &amp; Ludwig / Lyrics: Sammet]

He was born into this world
Living love but he got hurt
And he sighed when he beheld
The bleeding lamb

Blood and tears drip on the ground
Dung the olives on the mount
Love is crucified, made way
For the greed of man

There's no way out of here

No we don't, don't wanna take it no more
No we don't, don't wanna wait forever

Golden dawn, a new age has begun
Golden dawn, in every single one
Don't you run away, don't say it's all too late
Start to ring in the age... The golden dawn

Killing brothers, sick ideals, TV-Show lie and reveal
Poor philistine reasons why to hate a man
It's so easy to give in, do your dirty trick and win
Join those lemmings to the shore and fly but then

Don't complain if you'll drown in the end

Kill to eat, when you're the final one
There's no one to compete
Then find the time to think of a...
