When you cross the edge inside 
reach out for the stranger 
As you sign the deal tonight 
Icarus's your only guide 
See the haggard child of sun 
To the tempting fires you run 
Pass the gate and realize 
Casting evil eyes 

Down at your dark lab 
you threw some tarot cards 
Reading the fiery truth 
alchemist you were right 
the vision's alive 

The devil and the savant 
Gaze away 
Far away 
Alchemist you're free 
inside of your prison 
The devil and the savant 
Take a light, 
Getting sight of a revelation forced: 
the chemical wedding day... 

He appears at your desire 
Does your bidding - always 
Lights the candle in the dark 
See the blood - oh - of us all 
Think you force him to expose 
All above and all below 
You're never able to unveil 
what you had to feel... 

Taming your seraph but who is in control 
You or the demon called curiosity, Mephistopheles...
