[Music &amp; Lyrics: Sammet]

Strong on your feet, you were blinded
Building up a towar on shaking ground
Once in a world full of colors
Back to see just ruins there to be found

And now you're falling, crawling
Diggin in the broken remains
Of what had to be taken for strong
Slowly it's been fading away

Come into the painting on the wall
So the joker smiles
Come into the painting on the wall
No more crying
Illusions let you in from the rain
Follow Mr. Hopkins, get insane

Stories are told - wanna hear him
Talking from the picture to your head
Follow the call of a puppet
Led into a black room painted red

Where life is painless, brainless
You don't think of broken remains
Of what had to be taken for strong
Slowly it's been fading away

[repeat chorus]
[solo: Jens]

Look at the picture
Point at the child there on the floor
Realize that it's a looking glass

[repeat chorus]
