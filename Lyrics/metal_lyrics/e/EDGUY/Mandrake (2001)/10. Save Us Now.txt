[Music &amp; Lyrics: Sammet]

[solo: Shuttle-crash suite in F-Major, Marsian Traditional]

The sound of explosions, the children awake
The turn of the tide acts up, the ground it starts to quake
A pile of dented steel, in fear I realize
Behind the shuttle's windshield two evil shinig eyes

Highspeed alien drum bunny - Highspeed alien drum bunny

Handcuffed they take the stranded straight into their lab
Examine him, his DNA, what you give is what you will get
He takes his magic carrow, a bang and drums appear
He starts to play like thunder, mandkind flee to save your hearing

Highspeed alien drum bunny - Highspeed alien drum bunny

Save us now, somebody - Save us now, someone
From highspeed A.D.B.
Save us now, somebody - Save us now, someone
From highspeed A.D.B.

Bum Bum Bunny B., life is a drag I can tell
But let me count to four and then you play the roll of hell
One, two, one, two, three, four...

[hoplle-roll of hopple-hell bu the protagonist]
[solo: Both/Jens]

Highspeed alien drum bunny - Highspeed alien drum bunny
Hi fish, alien drum bunny - Hasi, alien drum bunny

[repeat chorus]

[Anonymous protagonist encouraging the cheering masses:]
This is alien drum bunnies' revenge - Resistance is futile!!!
