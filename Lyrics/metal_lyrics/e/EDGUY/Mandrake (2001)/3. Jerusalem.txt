[Music: Sammet &amp; Ludwig / Lyrics: Sammet]

Cold in the wind, starless the night
Rain pouring down when the last one arrives
So many stories telling of pain
Are told by the freaks they've been throwing away

Ride out, set off to the sea
Odd fellows, you and me
Sail on to a world far away
That might not exist, we must be insane

Torn and feathered
Put in the pillory my friend
Accused as a fool marching on
In quest for a place they don't know

To Jerusalem
The piper inside, can't you feel him calling
You don't be afraid of the horizon
To Jerusalem
Don't you give in to their fingers pointing
So don't be afraid, you won't crash at the horizon
The dwarf and the giant, children who stray
The dreamer who's walking far off their way
A jester cast out, he can't laugh anymore
Here comes the freakshow... Welcome on aboard

Torn and feathered
They'll never get what you say
Kill what they don't understand
Don't know and don't even try

[repeat chorus]
[solo: Both]
[repeat chorus]
