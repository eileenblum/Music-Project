[Music: Sammet &amp; Ludwig / Lyrics: Sammet]

Good intentions pave the way of the human child
Heading for the fork as you walk the path of life
A spell cast from the hiding woods, don't you close your eyes
The snake is waiting anytime to penetrate your mind
Don't you hear voices whispering, incline to walk down

Don't you see the shadow on the wall, angel eyes... the one cast out to fall
Calling me to look up to the sky we follow but we never know oh why

A vision revealing a child down where I've sure never been
An angel who's touching the flame, oh the angel is me

Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, let the cut run deep
Nailed, nailed to the wheel - Nailed, I said go - let bleed! - Go, - let bleed!

[solo: Jens]

Feel it crawl, feel the magic coming over like a daze
Welcome as the poison for the cornered snake
Taste of sin, bitter sweet, never, never let us go
But never, never, never is a price we'd pay to grow

They call it original sin, some call it divine
The moment the evil appeared... the chance to decide

[repeat chorus]

From children in cradles to hangmen who smile
Lick up the blood from the blade of your knife
Walk the stairway, leading down, ride on fire, take the crown

Your mind could be strong but your flesh will be mine
He's offering those kingdoms, they all could be thine
Rising powers, tempting gold, but at what price would it be sold?
It's all up to you...

[solo: Jens]
[repeat chorus]
