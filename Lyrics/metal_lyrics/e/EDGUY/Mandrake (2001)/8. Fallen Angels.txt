[Music &amp; Lyrics: Sammet]

Sun going down, she opens her eyes
It's dark in the belfry and cold
Whispers of rain, wind in the sky
So long it's been all she's been told

Dream child, you're all alone
Roaming though the night
Scream child, lost and ashamed
For all the tears you cry

You're a child in sadness
A chessboard nightmare to go
Hear that silent symphony
Calling you up to the shore and you'll see us

As we sail away, moonstruck and astray
We're fallen angels
We're the scary tale to scare your mind away
From fallen angels

[solo: Both]

So many days wasted in haze
You're free, oh so free on their strings
Illusions of life, they say you can fly
They laugh and they cut off your wings
Night child, they give you steel
And make you believe that it's gold
Lies child, all that you're told
Is just what you shall know

When they 'know' we are evil
We're strangers
And danger and fire,
The dark and the light
We are eyes in the night
Lost souls' they curse
For we've found it inside - oh

[repeat chorus]
[solo: Jens]

Ohhh, yeah...

[solo: Jens/Both]

When they say you're a fossil
When their eyes nail you to the cross
Take their curse and join our way
Welcome my frien on the ship of the damned - oh

[repeat chorus]
