[music &amp; lyrics: Ultravox]

Give us this day all that you showed me
The faith and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes

And they say that in our time
All that's good will fall from grace
Even saints would turn their face
In our time
And they told us that in our days
Different words said in different ways
Have other meanings from he who says
In our time

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes

And they say that in our time
We would reap from their legacy
We would learn from what they had seen
In our time
And they told us that in our days
We would know what was high on high
We would follow and not defy
In our time

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes

Faithless in faith
We must behold the things we see

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory, till my kingdom comes
Give me all the storybook told me
The faith and the glory till my kingdom comes
