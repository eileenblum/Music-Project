Always listen to what they tell - Dreamer
Crazy habits are a work of hell - Dreamer
Dressed in black and ordinary suits - Dreamer
All my life I have paid my dues - Goodbye

But here I am
To go my way
But here I am
I am sick of being here to pay

Never try to understand - Dreamer
What I do and what I can - Dreamer
Making love in the middle of a street - Dramer
Let them talk about how we treat ourselves - That's right

But here I am
To go my way
But here I am
I am sick of being here to stay
