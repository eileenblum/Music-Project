Crying on the pyre
Feeling - oh - so strange
Once you took my mind to deteriorate
Told me that you like me
Atrocious and deterrent lies
Told me how it is to suffer hate

Celebrate my funeral
Vultures on my corpse
Ashes to ashes - me to hell
Want to bury me alive
But you've never known
You are too deaf to hear my forces yell

On your mind the creeping hate
You hold the link to seal my fate
I stare into the light
Fire burning brightly
Inquisitition in our time
But I gotta tell you what I am

[Chorus]

Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle
Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle

I can still remember you
Coming with the reaper
How you tried to unlock my door

Sleepless nights - evil dreams
Faces in the window
Voices that I've never heard before

On your mind the creeping hate
You hold the link to seal my fate
I stare into the light
Fire burning brightly
Inquisitition in our time
But I gotta tell you what I am

[Chorus]

Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle
Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle

[Solo: Jens]

[Chorus]

Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle
Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle

Burniing - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle
Burning - I am burning
Yeah - burning like a frozen candle
