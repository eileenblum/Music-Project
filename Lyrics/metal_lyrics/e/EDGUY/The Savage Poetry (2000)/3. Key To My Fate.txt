Am I totally blind this time
As I'm dreaming the dreams that I fear
Some call it nightmare
And some call it life
What's the sense of existance here

And I think of the sadness
When I'm dreaming of leaving my pain
I don't get all the madness
But it drives me insane

[Chorus]

Now hear me cry
I'm in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh to the key
In the valley of hate - I don't know

Annihilation in my brain
What's the price that we will be to pay
When will you lift our poor little souls
Will you take us oh lord away

Oh when will we die
Why to suffer to stay upright
We are victims of our time
We have to fight till the end is in sight

[Chorus]

Now hear me cry
I'm in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh to the key
In the valley of hate - I don't know

[Solo: Jens/ Jens &amp; Dirk/ Jens]

What's the reason to carry on
What's the reason to falll
After days of living hell
After we had to crawl

Are we totally blind this time
Can't you tell the nexus
Of freedom and pain
Desire and hate and even the holy one

[Chorus]

Now hear me cry
I'm in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh to the key
In the valley of hate

Now hear me cry
I'm in quest of the key to my fate
I might be nigh to the key
In the valley of hate
