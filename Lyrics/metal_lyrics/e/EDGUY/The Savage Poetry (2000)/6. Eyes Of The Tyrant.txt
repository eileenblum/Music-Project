In the eyes of this might domain
And its evil doctrines
Can't feel the trace of romance
But fears that grow
No one can stare into his nextone's eyes
We killed the poetry around
A long time ago

How many times have you given me rage
When your words were mendacious
And your laughter insane
How many times
Have you written lapoons
About my life and desire
About my pleasure and pain

I bare my fangs to you
Look at my face and you'll stare
Into my mind and you see

[Chorus]

Eyes of the tyrant
These are the eyes of the night

Back from the hades
Into the daylight - No

Kiling of all nights
Tell me what should I do
Should I die in glory
Should I raise my fist

The crime of my deeds
Is the frolic I need
I won't die on my knees
Gotta kill to resist
I bare my fangs to you
Look at my face and you'll stare
Into my mind and you see

[Chorus]

Eyes of the tyrant
These are the eyes of the night

Back from the Hades
Into the daylight - no

[Solo: Jens]

The chagrin of the damned
Cries the tears of romance
Lord of uprightness take me know
World of the sad
It't the world of the mad
My heart died so long ago

[Solo: Jens]

Yeah - we are eternal we are immortal
A trace of glory in our hands
Majestic and wild
We stand and we fight

[Solo: Jens]

Soon your blackened pride
Will be fading away
You'll realize
You'll have been walking astray
Never tame the wicked
I'm a tyrant tonight
Back from the hades into the light

[Solo: Jens &amp; Dirk]

[Chorus]

Back from the hades into the
Eyes of the tyrant
These are the eyes of the night
