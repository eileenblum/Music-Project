A dawn on the run
Nowhere to hide
In a world of corruption
Insanity has won
I'm living in hate
And preaching destruction

I'm screaming "tonight"
My vengeance to fight
Has killed all morality
The cries of the toll
And madness control
And liberate my energy - axe to the wax

[Chorus]

Misguiding your life
You'll reach the empire of madness
I will be rife - driven by insanity or hate
Misguiding your life
You'll reach the empire of madness
I will be rife - driven by insanity or hate

Lunacy and rage
Rage in my head
Reign back to back
Come and be my slave
The beauty in your face
Will be fading to black

I'm screaming "tonight"
My vengeance to fight
Has killed all my morality
The cries of the toll
And madness control
And liberate my energy - axe to the wax

[Chorus]

Misguiding your life
You'll reach the empire of madness
I will be rife - driven by insanity or hate
Misguiding your life
You'll reach the empire of madness
I will be rife - driven by insanity

I misguide your life

[Solo: Jens &amp; Dirk]

[Chorus]

Misguiding your life
You'll reach the empire of madness
I will be rife - driven by insanity or hate
Misguiding your life
You'll reach the empire of madness
I will be rife - driven by insanity or hate
