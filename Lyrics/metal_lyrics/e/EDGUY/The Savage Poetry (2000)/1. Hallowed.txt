Sacred - standing full of pride
Spite on my mind, spite in my brain
Guiding me to fight
Enchained - you pray to be a slave
Rules without sense, no little sense
To dust you will decay

[Chorus]

Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation
You beg for danmation
You think you can serve me in hate
Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation
You beg for danmation
You think you can serve me in hate

Hatred - pushed into a war
Those who blaspheme
Don't join your way
Dying by your sword
Sacred - hallowed be my name
For "peace" you destroy
Lie and deny
A glorious crusade

[Chorus]

Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation
You beg for danmation
You think you can serve me in hate
Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation
You beg for danmation
You think you can serve me in hate

[Solo: Jens]

[Chorus]

Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation
You beg for danmation
You think you can serve me in hate
Hallowed be my name
Hallowed be my name
God of creation
You beg for danmation
You think you can serve me in hate
