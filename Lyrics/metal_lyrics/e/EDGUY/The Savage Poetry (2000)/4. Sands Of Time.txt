Seasons come and seasons go
Here I wait for something to be
Try to get as much as I can see
Hungry for life
But have you seen the sands of time
Every day is a moment in past
Every heartbeat a step to my last
I won't survive

Don't know what time is meant to be
If it's my friend or enemy
Or does it only run, run to set an end
Secrets of a crazy dream
Or just a bad reality
I don't know

Do you feel the sands of time
Running low to break the line
First we learn to fly
Then we learn to cry
Later in the evening we may die

Questions roaming through my brain
I'll be leaving into my grave
I'll be dead, hope my soul will be safe
For a time, hope forever
All the seasons will have been gone
Time will come that you will forget
My name and all the words that I said
My time will be over

Don't know what time is meant to be
If it's my friend or enemy
Or does it only run, run to set an end
Secrets of a crazy dream
Or just a bad reality
I don't know

Do you feel the sands of time
Running low to break the line
First we learn to fly
Then we learn to cry
Later in the evening we may die

Do you feel the sands of time
Running low to break the line
Do you feel the sands of time
Running low to break the line
First we learn to fly
Then we learn to cry
Later in the evening we may die
