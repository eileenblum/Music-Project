I'm feeling this time
As bad as never before
A bleeding wag is fading away
Once you needed me
For spending delight
But below the funny mask
There's a crying face

The way that I smile is the way that I cry
But you'll never realize
My reputation is the one of a fool
Now watch how poet dies
Hear his cries

[Chorus]

And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there is no mind to help me to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no none to drink
The blood that I bleed

The poet inside - wasn't given a chance
So he had to live apart
And I realized - my best friend am I
And not those parasites
Who try to stare into my heart

The way that I feel is the way that I heal
My body and soul and my life
And I know you just think I'm a fool
Now watch how a poet flies, see me rise

[Chorus]

And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there is no mind to help to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no one to drink
The blood that I bleed

[Solo: Jens]

[Chorus]

And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there's no mind to help me to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no one to drink the blood that I bleed

And I dedicate my roses to no one
Cause there's no mind to help me to see
The reason we need
A light for the lonesome
And no one to drink the blood that I bleed
