I'm a sacred king in a sacred kingdom
You know me just as a royality
Looking kind so you don't see
I'd like to steal your virginity

I was born to feign an angel
The evil knows just now to hide
I sold me soul to rise away
To build up powers you can't fight

So kind and noble till I wake the animal

[Chorus]

At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty
At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty

I'm a master of disguise
I hate to be your marionette
And I won't care if you'll be hanging
Shut... up - come in my bed

I'm a reckless animal
Spitting out a flood of lies
Till you know my perversity
Is to do it and do it and do it and die

Black suite and business,
Till I wake the animal

[Chorus]

At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty
At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty

Oh yeah

Rising high - higher and higher
Higher and higher we rise

[Solo: Jens]

[Chorus]

At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty
At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty

[Scenery: horny forester walks through a bavarian forest at the foot of a mountain while he bumps into little maria and little margot. Who are yodeling complacent coming back from picking berries successfully]

At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty
At night - we fly - we rise
We are power and majesty
