Ravens in the air - no one in the streets
Seems like the fiend has come back
Riding on fire - scarlet's the sky
Love's slownly starting to crack

Whiolash and torture
Envy is driving our hate
The whole world around
Is mad and confused
The end has begun
We're facing our fate

Staring through eyes of hate we kill
Are we controlled or is it our own will
Don't use for brain
Don't look for a reason
Don't feel ashame
While we put the blame on the demon

[Chorus]

Sacred hell - sacred hell
There's nothing but names on the wall
You can be free - you can face tomorrow
Sacred hell - sacred hell
Now the fiend must be back on our ball
Don't sow the sin - don't reap the sorrow

No lucid intervals
No good will to guide
Devil in disguise
End in damnation cause we only hide
Calling him to rise

Staring through eyes of hate we kill
Are we controlled or is it our own will
Don't use our brain
Don't look for a reason
Don't feel ashame
Don't put the blame on the demon

[Chorus]

Sacred hell - sacred hell
There is nothing but names on the wall
You can be free - you can face tomorrow
Sacred hell - sacred hell
Now the fiend must be back on our ball
Don't sow the sin - don't reap the sorrow

[Solo: Jens]

Staring through eyes of hate we kill
Are we controlled or I it our own will
Don't use our brain
Don't look for a reason
Don't feel ashame
While we put the blame on the demon

[Chorus]

Sacred hell - sacred hell
There is nothing but names on the wall
You can be free - you can face tomorrow
Sacred hell - sacred hell
Now the fiend must be back on our ball
Don't sow the sin - don't reap the sorrow
