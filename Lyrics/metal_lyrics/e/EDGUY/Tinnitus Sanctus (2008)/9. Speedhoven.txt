Welcome to this wonderworld
Everybody take your sledges
Winterland Plutocracy
Down the slope don't fear the hedges

Everybody in their box
Waiting under rights of action
Raise your heads and hold your breath
I can't stand your putrefaction

I can smell your brain decay
As you look down at the stage and
Drive me mad and then insane
Welcome to the show

You've been waiting for the one
To bring you joy and ecstasy
And you've been waiting for a song
And you demand to feel the tragedy

But when it's right out of control
And it's not your song anymore
And you are ready to forget
The truth that you'd been asking for

I'm not afraid to sacrifice
And I don't care bout your advice
As I spread my wings and fly

No love - it's pain you've come to feed
In mental strain I crawl and bleed
You make me please

Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever roaming
Every starless night
You will hear the cries

You'll never get:
I'll never be the one that you want me to be
And all the treasures that you hold
All your diamond rings and gold
All your flake and look and tongue
I have tried and it was wrong

You tried to push me up a notch
But all I made was an itchy crotch
Fornication, ass galore
I wanted love and I want more
Muckrakers waiting for the prey
Muckrakers want me to obey
But you will never own me
Though you pay

This opera is haunted they will say
That's where they've driven the light insane

Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever roaming
Every starless night
You will hear the cries
Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever you'll hear it scream

In a cold winter night I had a vision
Taking me by my hand
Leading me to the door
To rescue me from the wastelands

The glance of the shining ivories
A world that they can't understand
Out of sound, out of reason
The voice of their laughter was gone

Taken away, time for a change
I'm walking over
Flying away, flying away
Dying into another world
Pure and divine
And the laughter dies

Welcome to this wonderworld
Everybody take your sledges
Winterland Plutocracy
Down the slope don't fear the hedges

Forever roaming
You will hear it scream
The cries of Speedhoven
Forever roaming...
