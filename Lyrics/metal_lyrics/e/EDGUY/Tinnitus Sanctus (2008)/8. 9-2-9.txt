We opened the door after midnight
To step into a timeless world
Angels and madness been flying around
A crack in the voice of reason
Something has taken over
Preventing us from turning around

Been sailing across the seas
We never arrived but always believed
And now for the first time time I feel
The port I was too blind to see

929 - Just a number at sundown
A room with a view
929 - A night to remember
929 - I been reaching out
I been stumbling around
929 - I'm finally home

Been standing there with a suitcase
Surroundings fighting to get out
Send it off to the Lost-And-Never-Found
Maybe I don't have my head on straight
Maybe I'll lose it tomorrow
Preventing me from turning around

Been sailing across the seas
Up in the wind
Plowing through grief
And now for the first time I see
The port I was too blind to see

929 - A number at sundown
A room with a view
929 - A night to remember
929 - I been reaching out
I been stumbling around
929 - I'm finally home
