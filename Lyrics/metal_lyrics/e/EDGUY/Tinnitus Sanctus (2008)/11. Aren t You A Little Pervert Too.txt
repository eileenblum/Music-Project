This one is for our troops
Who beat the shit
Out of bad people
And their families

Aren't you a little pervert too
Just a little handcuff doesn't do
Beat the bullet, push and pull it
Till the crotch is black and blue
Aren't I a little pervert too

Aren't you a little pervert too
Think the seventh orifice will do
You're the socket for the rocket
In my pocket dododoooo
I know you're a little pervert too

There's a million different ways to get off
I have seen it on TV in Tokyo
In Finland and Australia
Not so much in America
Americans prefer the Rodeo

Aren't you a little pervert too
Dream of what a whip can do to you
All your lipstick on my dipstick
As you scream like a baboon
Aren't you a little pervert too

Aren't you a little pervert too
Getting off waiting at the loo
For the hour the golden shower
Is being spilled all over you
I know honey that you want it too
Let me spill my love all over you

I know you're a little pervert too
