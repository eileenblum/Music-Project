No rules, no pain, no fear and no reason
Full moon, we're insane
Two-time and one big treason

There is fire in the air tonight
A wicked sensation
Stick waving, dick waving
Trial-run of procreation

Lady don't leave us in a mess
Take the bow and shove it up your ass

Go die or rock tonight
No tradeoff - there's just dead or rock
Your house on fire tonight
No tradeoff - there's just dead or rock

She reigns and goes down, your muse in prudery
Encaged, enslaved, depraved and shaved
Austerity

We're caviar to the general
Beyond your sight
Rape your imagination
Kicking up a row tonight

Oh we have come to make a mess
Kiss the baton and then shove it up your ass

Go die or rock tonight
No tradeoff - there's just dead or rock
Your house on fire tonight
No tradeoff there's just dead or rock
Expert on art: Aristocratic, uptight and pathetic

Don't need no sympathy
Don't need to play by the rules
Go down in ecstasy, go down on you

Go die or rock tonight...
