[Music &amp; lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

When the lights go down you feel it come alive
Driven by the dread of love that never passes by
When the night unfolds a veil across the day
Waiting for the flood to come to wash the stains away

Look at the clouded sky
Poisoned rain, angels cry
Cracks show in the seal

Tonight a thousand angels fall
Heaven's up against the wall
Changes holding sway
We can make you anyone
By the morning we'll be gone
The ministry of saints

You're afraid to disappear beneath the waves
Bread and circus, bread and wine
They rain on your parade
Round and round and round
You're spinning like a wheel
Crying for redemption you break the seventh seal

We're cleansing your soul from sin
Plead for you, angels sing
We're taking pride of place

Tonight a thousand angels fall
Heaven's up against the wall
And change is holding sway
We can make you anyone
By the morning we'll be gone
The ministry of saints

Tonight a thousand angels fall
Heaven's up against the wall
And change is holding sway
We can make you anyone
By the morning we'll be gone
The ministry of saints
