[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

Hey there pal won't you gimme an ear
Gimme your everything and keep your fear
Godly voices telling me what to do
They're out for palpitation
Then leave you to your desperation
Take you and tie you and run over you

There's no resistance to the cry of the sirens
Calling you - a razor edge affair
You close your eyes boy
She tears your lids in two
Never even try to miss she's there

And then when the time pieces shatter
I am baptized by the attar
Right into heavens door

[Chorus:]
Sex Fire Religion
Visionary position
Angel in your temple of pleasure
Sex Fire Religion
I been granted admission
Angel in your temple of love

Wicked wild m'am with a bag full of tricks
And up shit creek there I'm stuck in a fix
Strikes like a bolt from the blue
The siren baits with lubrication
Then she steals your habitation
Rides you and ties you and runs you

Maybe she don't know love
But she knows how to make it
Divinity is running down her skin
In the city of evil we touch the sky
Let the ride to paradise begin

And when the time pieces shatter
I am baptized by the attar
Kick down into the pie

[Chorus 2x]
