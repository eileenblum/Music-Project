[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

Silence - it ain't the kill but the thrill of the chase
Same old story, same old song
Only the names have changed

Fair warning - I could have read your mind in time
By the look in your eyes
Like diamonds turning to ashes
Ties frayed and missed your signs

Now I can't get over you
Cannot get under somebody else
I close my eyes

[Chorus:]
When all I see is you, you came to drain my love away
But it takes nine lives till it's over
All I see is you, you came to drain my life away
But I got nine, I got nine lives till it's over

All my supplications gone unheard
Your head in my crotch has turned to a boot
But you won't hear a word

Salvation - I ride into nowhereand out of nowhere I'll come
The twinge in your brain, the pang pf regret
Don't mess with no son of a gun

I'm gonna get over this
Gotta get under somebody else
I close my eyes

[Chorus 2x]

Till it's over I got nine lives, I got nine lives
