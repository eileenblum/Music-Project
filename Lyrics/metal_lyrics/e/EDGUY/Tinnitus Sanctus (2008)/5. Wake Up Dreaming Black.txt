[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

You gotta know
That there ain't always
Words of reason to explain
With those words my heart is falling silent
To let me slowly go insane

God tell me why your voice ran dry
And left me dreaming black

[Chorus:]
Dying angels, Dying angels
Feeling takes a gun to fire
Reason from a lightening sky
Dying angels, dying angels
I'm agonizing over dreams
Strangled by a feeling
I wake up dreaming black

A million single islands drift apart
And I'm losing ground
The more I feel the less I know
Strait-jacket-hero inward bound

God tell me why your voice ran dry
And left me dreaming black

[Chorus 2x]

I wake up dreaming
Another hero - a dying hero
Another hero - a dying hero
