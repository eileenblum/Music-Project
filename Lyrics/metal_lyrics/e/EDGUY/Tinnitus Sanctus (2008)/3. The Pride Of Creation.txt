[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]

I can't figure the Lord down in funeral gravity
One finishing touch and the creature is coming alive
As I kneel down and pray
I know God is watching over me
Is He pissing himself
When He's knocking me out of my stride

And on day number eight
When the sun is about to go down
Were we go, what a show
What a nose for blow

[Chorus:]
You're alive said the maker and smiled to the aardvark
You're divine by the grace of the master above
You're alive said the maker and smiled to the aarkvard
You're divine by the grace of the master above

Hey Frankenstein are you the one I think you are
Godfather If we're divine you are bizarre
I hear you laughing from the loge above
At my expense for your entertainment

Hey Lord above why don't your armies ever smile
Godfather why don't the ever dress in style
And never share the humor that you surely have
Creating me for your entertainment

Why do they have to get married
Before they do what they do
Everyday anyway, when there's hell to pay

[Chorus]

We fold our hands afraid of what we've done
Fear is the key to you - thy kingdom come
You shake your head and have another wine
Don't you almost die laughing wondering why

Running in the dust, running in the dust
Afraid of the hail stones cold as ice
Running in the dust, running in the dust
Straight to the wastelands
We'll never read your signs

[Chorus:]
You're alive, oh you're alive
You're alive, the pride of creation

Oh you're the pride of creation, yes you are
Oh you're the pride of creation
