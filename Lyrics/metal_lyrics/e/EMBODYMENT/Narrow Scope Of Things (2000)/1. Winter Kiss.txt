lobby lines with stairs
rebuke the structure
kiss on the hand
fades to god's will
i would kill to see your face
lady in red
watch your surroundings
i'm going out on a limb
would kill to see your face
three weeks of torture brought me here
pass the moons
reject friendly envy
more on desire than principal
wish you here...
