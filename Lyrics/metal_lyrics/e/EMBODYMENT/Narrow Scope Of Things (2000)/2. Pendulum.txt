there's a hitch in the step
the tower is leading
grown a thousand years in a single heartbeat
ripped and torn at the seams
and he falters to his knees
clutching hands while in her dreams
sitting on weakness so that strength can stand
look to the future, caressing the name angels are watching, spreading their wings
rest, my love, ride on the wings of sacred prayers
aided by angelic force
ripped and torn at the seams
