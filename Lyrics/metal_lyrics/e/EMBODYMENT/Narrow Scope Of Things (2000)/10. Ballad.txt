drench me in kisses
your breath consumes my pores
leave my heart in one
i swallow sunsets day by day
media makes me ill
previous desires have been slain
'cause all i want is you
your presence makes me child like
my soul's at heaven's gate
my curfew turns to stone
this repetition kills me
oh, please don't scorch my heart
i'm at a loss for words
please let this rose
speak for me
i love you, i need you, i want you
you give me strength to live
i feel like i'm ten feet tall
forget thoughts of closure
an addict for your love
a diamond is forever
as well my love for you
your face invades my dreams
please be my wife
