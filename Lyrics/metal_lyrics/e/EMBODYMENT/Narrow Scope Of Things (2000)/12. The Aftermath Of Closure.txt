step into the circle
blush the tears away
find joy in completion
i've fulfilled my vow
it's all been said, but chew on this
i offered my heart
the family is waiting
we'll now give thanks have you been through this?
It's all been said, but chew on this
some may fall to the wayside
forget nameless monkeys
our souls always moving
icons we'll be
it's all been said, but chew on this
