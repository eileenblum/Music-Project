i fight this with two closed fists
under a purple sky
naked trees are clawing for the air
this won't pull on emotions
but it's something to do
go ahead, try it
if you dislike, refunds at the door
i always fell for the sucker punch
i confess the changes
maybe i'm growing up
from the shoes on my feet
to the stench in my mouth
i'll remain transparent
and while you speak in codes, i'll speak in spirit
i tasted, now i'm hooked.
