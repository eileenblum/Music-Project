assembly line, humans pumped with lies
line them up, load them tight
packed like cigarettes
a new committee to breed lukewarm souls
get off my back (please)
swallow your pride and gag
harriet tubman, will you set the captives free for the underground?
take long drags on yourself
with cracker-jack poses and smiles
another snubbed beneath your toe
get off my back (please)
swallow your pride and gag
harriet tubman, will you set the captives free for the underground?
