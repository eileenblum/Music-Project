it's your bleeding heart 
and selling so well 
an hour too late 
too much time to kill 
and forcing your tears 
and milking the pain 
and raking it in, the sin 
and i already know there's one chance around 
and the record shows you wanna make the grade 
and the word is out you sold your soul today 
and i already know 
stick out your chest, the masses await 
a white collar side show 
the auction begins 
they'll tickle your ear 
and give you the grin 
and it's such a shame, who's to blame 
and i already know there's one chance around 
and the record shows you wanna make the grade 
and the word is out you sold your soul today 
and it's over... 
if you and i could find a way to make it right i'd go 
but here we stand with troubles minds and empty ands 
let it pass, let it pass
