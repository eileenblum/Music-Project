help me, i've left a woman scorned 
stay out, another chore undone 
know this, i'm fading from your touch 
i'm hopeless, my conscious weighs me down 
i'm leavin, i'm cheatin 
and what comes around goes around 
draw back, and let the loss sink in 
hod on, and fish amongst the sea 
and tied down it's hard to be content 
and bail out the finger points at you 
i'm leavin, i'm cheatin 
and what comes around goes around 
i'm not your enemy...we just fell out 
i'm not your enemy...i found new blood 
hold back your emotions 
speak within reason 
turn on the lights 
put down the knife 
we can resolve this 
i'm leaving, i'm cheating 
and what comes around goes around
