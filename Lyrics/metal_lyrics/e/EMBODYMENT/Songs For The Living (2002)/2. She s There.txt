i'm giving up on heart conditions 
and loath the days of expectation 
she only visits for a second 
and leaves a nightmare for my soul 
i prayed that God would end this torture 
but now i fear to shut my eyes 
but in my head she's there 
i kick myself,recall her name 
but in my head i know 
she wanted me but i'm alone 
i only dwell on formal glories 
relive the best days of my life 
but i refused to take her offer 
she wept and somehow found the door 
but in my head she's there 
i kick myself, recall her name 
but in my head i know 
she wanted me but i'm alone 
she's in my head...and i'll bring you home, clean all my mistakes 
what's done is done, and it goes on and on and on
