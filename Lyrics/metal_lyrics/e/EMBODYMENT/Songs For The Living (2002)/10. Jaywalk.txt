clear your head one-time friend of mine 
she's cold blue and no skin 
whisper prayers to make amends 
no promises to break 
kiss my face and deny my name 
once you were my own 
close your eyes and resist the view 
and throw your cares away 
i called your name, come, come my way 
i blocked your face, come my way 
take the night to an open road 
and choose your morbid fate 
raise the stakes to a higher plain 
this is life or death 
i called your name, come, come my way
