plain as day the industry was starving 
i'll light your flame 
turn away and leave the prize to others 
i'm on way 
set me up 
pave my way 
i'm reaching out 
make a change the masses live in static 
i'll ring your bell 
for all the times they gave it up for nothing 
i'll have my say 
set me up 
pave my way 
i'm raching out 
hear this, hear this, hear this...i want it more than love 
it's golden, golden, golden...where the road ends up 
hold it, hold it, hold it...savor what you taste 
dan't waste it, waste it, waste it... dare to live 
give your all, build your dreams, kill your fears 
set me up 
pave my way 
i'm reaching out
