i had a feelin we're losing 
and there was a reason, treason-denial 
i had a feelin they're waiting...they're waiting 
raising up our hands 
white flag high 
in a day you can say you own it 
draw the line and define your behavior 
i'm not like you, i won't be you 
analyze all the lies you're promoting 
i had a feeling we're cheatin 
one has to make it, take it, or prove it 
i had a feelin it's over 
raising up our hands 
white flag high 
in a day you can say you own it 
draw the line and define your behavior 
i'm not like you, i won't be you 
analyze all the lies you're promoting 
i'm not like you, i won't be you, i'm not like you 
we're at the end, the final lap, it's so alarming 
we made a case, turned a cheek, but who's responding 
tell the truth, don't delay, so are you buying? 
burn the bridge, take the loot, hit the target
