turn the lights out, hard ties out and grope 
feed the body, break your oath and float 
i'm tired of dying for you 
and chatting with your ghost 
no, you don't need it 
no, you should fight it 
no, you don't need it...no 
bite the bullet, sear your flesh and blow 
take the ransom, don't look back and run 
she's tired of dancing for you and filling up your cup 
no, you don't need it 
no, you should fight it 
no, you don't need it...no 
close your eyes 
seal your grave 
turn the lights out hard ties out and grope 
feed the body, break your oath and float 
i'm tired of dying for you 
and chatting with your ghost 
and no...
