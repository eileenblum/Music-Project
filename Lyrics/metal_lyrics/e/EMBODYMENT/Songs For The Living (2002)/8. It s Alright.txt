push the child into the wheel 
make your memories long 
take the leap into the space 
don't look back in fear 
now here my voice 
baby, i made it and it's all right 
and i don't want it to end 
chase your prize on through the grave 
live beyond your dreams 
seize the day and ride the wave 
claim your destiny 
now here my voice 
baby, i made it and it's all right 
and i don't want it to end 
i reached beyond tall fables 
vultures by my window 
camera flashes daily 
caught in the glare 
welcome home! welcome home! 
baby, i made it and it's all right 
and i don't want it to end
