for every word you say 
and all the moments wasted 
i'm finding out you're made for me 
with every look i catch 
and truth that is unspoken 
i'm praying that you miss me 
i'm nearly dead since you departed 
and i wait for you, i wait for you and you said 
time is all we have before us 
hold our moments and don't turn away 
i'm going out on faith 
and bringing my devotion 
you can trust i won't shame you 
i'm nearly dead since you departed 
and i wait for you, i wait for you and i said 
time is all we have before us 
hold our moments and don't turn away 
and right away i knew we could make it 
cos we're living and learning 
and sacrifice tells us what we're gaining 
in losing and taking 
i'm holding out for the one that loved me 
forever no playing 
and in a way they could say we're crazy 
for hoping and praying 
i'll wait for you 
time is all we have before us 
and hold our moments 
and don't turn away
