turn me up, get it on, i was yours, i was your man 
but not in your hands 
pull away, take it back, break your vow, call on my name 
i've gone astray 
lead me on, kiss my face, play my card, show me your way 
cos i understand 
take it off, spill your guts, lay it down, walk in my shoes 
cos i'm in your hands 
and i'll role your way 
you have my heart in your hands-don't go 
we've come too far, hold on now- cos i want you 
turn away, hide your face, show your spine and be a man 
you know what i mean 
clean the page, share the view, be a doll call me tonight 
i'm here by the phone 
roll the dice, take a chance, live your life outside your box 
and come to my world 
make a fist, come aboard, bitter the taste in your mouth 
but that's how it goes 
and you rolled my way 
you have my heart in your hands-don't go 
we've come too far, hold on now- cause i want you 
say you'll stay, make my day-don't go 
say you're mine for all time-cause i want you 
our souls will grow 
we'll carry on
