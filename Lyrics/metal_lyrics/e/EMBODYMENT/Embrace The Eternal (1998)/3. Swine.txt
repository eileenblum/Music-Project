standing breathless before the throne of Christ
judgement has fallen leaving you crying why God why
where is your savior?
mindless follower
bow to your altar of mockery now it is time to face truth
you have been lied to constantly
truth is in Christ soon you will see
your pagan religion is full of deception
you cannot conceive eternal damnation
satan has led you away from redemption
the blood of the Son is your only salvation
liar leading the weak to burn with you in hell
lucifer you will lose, you were overthrown
defeated since beginning
your anger fueled with envy
God's perfect image you set out to destroy
but you're unsuccessful your end is now approaching
heed prophecy you were warned
