take me up from this world can't you see the hurting inside?
how you all him, to defile my person
invite infelicity and this world it tries to weaken my faith
buy you are my strength in this world of ignorance
blinded by sin i question your motives
leaving myself to abhorrent ways
this devil is beaten i decollate your servants
sword of the Spirit I will defy you
Lord you are so faithful with me everyday
Your heart forever graceful assurance of victory
in my heart and should no dominion
the path that Christ walked i choose to live
death is swallowed up in victory
my faith in God i will not shudder
i will not shudder i choose to walk the way that Christ did
Lord you are so faithful with me everyday
Your heart forever graceful assurance of victory
