pride yourself unholy one, never grasp the throne of God
receive your fate your prideful pig forever you will not win
i will not be deceived
i will not give into your temptation
i am bought by the Blood of Jesus
the power of heaven protects me
meaningless to me is blasphemies
you say i am weak (by Christ i'm made strong)
denying temptation (through God)
sit at your throne of this world creating your patchwork of hate
call me what you want the truth remains the same
i am branded christian
immortal soul of mine fearing not this world
i am enslaved by no man
remaining in my faith i do not stand alone
my spirit is willing
falling to my knees a servant unto Christ in this world of disease
forever, eternal. standing by my Father's side
as i watch this world return to sodom &amp; gomorrah
i hate to watch you fall
i bow down to only one God - Christ who died and arose
and to see you wallow in your shame and to deny His love and grace?
i hate to watch you fall
pride yourself unholy one, never grasp the throne of God
receive your fate your prideful pig forever you know you will not win
forget my past
in time you stand to question my faith
a continuing game of chasing your tail
i will not give into your clouded ways
and from this path my foot will never stray
i will not be deceived
i will not give into your temptations
i am bought by the Blood of Jesus
the power of heaven protects me
meaningless to me is blasphemies
