prey your eyes from the deformity God make them see
laughter ringing in my head God make them see
i am not weak (if our spirits were meant to walk)
i am weak (which one of you would take this chair)
you wouldn't
why do you keep staring at me?
your judgement is hurting
whispering your condemnation
accept me God made me
tearing me down must build you up
i don't think so, i don't think so
i will walk again hand in hand with my Father
look at me look at me through these eyes
i can see i can see you staring at me
with a heart not willing to understand
carousel is me beneath your feet frowned upon
i am the show i am the game so come and play
with my emotions guilt ridden conscience
receive your prize guilt ridden conscience
quiet stay quiet
carousel is me beneath your feet frowned upon
i am the show i am the game so come and play
with my emotions guilt ridden conscience
receive your prize guilt ridden conscience
