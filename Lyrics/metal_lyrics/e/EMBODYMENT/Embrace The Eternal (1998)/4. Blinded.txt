overwhelming lust consumes my spirit
i have given into my own flesh
corrupted, corrupted, corrupted, no longer
i beat my chest in disgust with my actions
starting a battle knowing i will fall
but return to you Lord knowing my failure
the consequences of my actions have found me on my face
defiling thoughts intentions numb to my conviction
i am weak submitting to myself my spirit stained
no more convictions these thoughts remain impure
i beat my chest in disgust with my actions
starting a battle knowing i will fall
blinded i must cut myself from this flesh
blinded separate myself from this sin
blinded rise above my shame
blinded this will not triumph over me
defiling thoughts intentions numb to my conviction
i am weak submitting to myself my spirit stained
no more convictions these thoughts remain impure
the act is still the same without your physical involvement
selfish intentions forced upon her purity (lost)
how can you allow her to bleed for you
blinded i must cut myself from this flesh
blinded separate myself from this sin
blinded rise above my shame
blinded this will not triumph over me
