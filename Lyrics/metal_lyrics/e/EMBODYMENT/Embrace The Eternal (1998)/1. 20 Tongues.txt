run your mouth
brothers, sisters watch your back
knives are coming down from the mouths of family
put down, let down, let die through these lies
broken i stand unreconciled
submissive resistance amputation of a helping hand
gossip, gossip, gossip
pride comes before your fall
who do you think of when you're running your mouth?
your friends, they tell me every word that you say
good thing i have you to tell my story for me
your reflection stands shattered
our trust is broken
your finger points right back at you
when your words are so many sin is close by
driven by anger, driven by anger
brothers, sisters watch your back
knives are coming down from the mouths of family
put down, let down, let die through these lies
broken i stand unreconciled
submissive resistance amputation of a helping hand
gossip, gossip, gossip
pride comes before your fall
caught in hatred, caught in anger, when will this stop?
who do you think of when your running your mouth?
