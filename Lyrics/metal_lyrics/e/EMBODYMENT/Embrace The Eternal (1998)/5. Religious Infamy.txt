your individual erodes doing saying what you're told
perception of reality is destroyed
blinded submission, consumption with reason, brainwashed, corrupted and controlled
oppressed slaves to your aggression, driven
absolute control is a must
the life you once new imagination victims of one enemy
new is all you know old is forgotten
religious infamy turn away it will set you free
bonded by hate break the chains of your spiritual state
what you seek is the truth in the darkness nothing is pure
once you see what they hide you are the one they truly despise
born again into a life without conformity
innocent lives brought into strife imbed impurity
the planted seeds it's roots will grow in which by means to feed
uplift the roots regain your soul declare your right to live
to fit scripture in the end will be their own demise
false religion i despise new age never fastens it's grip on me
predictions of falsehood wallow in the flames
as you watch your false prophets die
i will never leave my doctrine
the truth shall set you free
fallow unto me there is truth in my deception
false reality truth surfaced need for correction
religious infamy turn away it will set you free
bonded by hate break the chains of your spiritual state
what you seek is the truth in the darkness nothing is pure
once you see what they hide you are the one they truly despise
