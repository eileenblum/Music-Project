crucifixion
up on the cross dying for sins fulfilling prophecy
beaten for His faith praying for enemies upon sacrifice
forsaken in the eyes of God sins of man to Him were taken
innocent and blameless death without purity
place of the skull golgotha death of the Son
descend into misery His death to bring us life
covered in the Blood supreme sacrifice bridging the gap
between God and man
flesh torn, humility
blood flows purely from the Cross of Calvary
defying death rose from the grave to show it is finished
to show all before the ascension to empyrean
atoning is the Blood of Jesus Christ
Give in to Him live in the Blood of Christ
He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose
resurrection
