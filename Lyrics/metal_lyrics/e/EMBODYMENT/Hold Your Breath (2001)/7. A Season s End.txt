send me over...taste the day
blink in fragments...and gone away
captured moments...hold the frame
mold me, build me, lead me on
i'm only growing older
bond through body...for all days
scars are stories...read the pain
joy and sorrow...with the sun
thanks forever...to the grave
mold me, build me, lead me on
i'm only growing older
