you found me
once again ground into spores
your lipstick matches your dark intentions
pull off the script for a time
for spotlight banners will soon be dawning
and now the curtain will rise
you found me
i let you go...you're on
tomorrow hinges on words
taste, touch, and tease your way through the door
court jesters fall to their graves
fair maiden, exit the scene of my world
and now the curtain will fall
you found me
i let you go...you're on
