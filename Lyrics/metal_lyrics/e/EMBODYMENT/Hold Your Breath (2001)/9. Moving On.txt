you let me go...warmly
turned my back...growing
and setting out...boldly
i'm making up for lost time
coming home
and i swear it's true
i need you
so take me back...hoping
abandon ship...learning
drop my guns...open
tear my core...broken
i'm making up for lost time
coming home
don't break my neck
hold your own
drink in deep, cherish breath, moving on
and i swear it's true
i need you
and you swear it's true
we're never through
build this up...stronger
hold you close...always
