he found a wrist and cut his meter
mary sings only sweet and low
blow a kiss for headstone martyrs
taking the blame - i'm letting go, i knew that i'd give in
bring the ax upon their notions
paper money is your soul
break the chains, the rope is swinging
taking the blame - i'm letting go, i knew that i'd give in
i'm fasting, you're cheating, turn me over
a thousand times good-bye, be lonely
a caffeine rush for tears of joy
I'll carve the beef and spare you later
