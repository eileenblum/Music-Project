hold this sanity within your hands
demons tease and migrate, soar on wings
but you my guardian angel pull me through
stay, darling - giving up, giving in, kiss your lover
nylon barricades and window soul
red cross meetings daily ground this root
clever thoughts like you and me make us
stay, darling - giving up, giving in, kiss your lover
stay - I'll find you home - be not far from me
roll the stone, the sun has brought the day
cradle nothing in the arms of peace
break time, lather, ointments aren't healing
