ghost dancer, i here you
circle my heart in yours
i'm seeking your presence
in hope of dreams come true
on subways, train stations
I'll save the night for you
you're acting, role-playing
and swimming in my head
you'll burn me down
a wish away
you've burned me down
I'll travel forever
in you I'll find my home
and silence is broken
your name has found my tongue
these moments of madness
have turned my joy to shame
you'll burn me down
a wish away
you've burned me down
