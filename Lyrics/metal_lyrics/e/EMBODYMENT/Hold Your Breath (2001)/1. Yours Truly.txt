i want to know you're broken for the path you've chosen
i want to know you're reaping what you have sown
and i'll give you more than you've ever wanted
faithful forever, with these words i promise
you want it, you got it - it's all for real
i want to know you're breathing for the day of morrow
i want to know you'll suffer to rest in peace
and i've given more than you've ever wished for
forever faithful, with these words i promise
you want it, you got it it's all for real
it's all for real - let it go
