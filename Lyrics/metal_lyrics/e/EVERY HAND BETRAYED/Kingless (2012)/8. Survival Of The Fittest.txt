Poison spreads across this earth coating us and what do you know its reviving all of the dead. We must team up, stay strong before they all ascend before all our daylight ends. They are multiplying by the masses theyâll even craw to get to you. Fiends for the brain the moans and groans getting louder with every little passing minute. They wonât give up. The sun is going down we need to find shelter no time to be a hero its survival of the fittest. We turned around in time to see the hordes running toward us. Itâs time to shoot the dead take your aim were gonna make it rain, make it rain blood, we will make, make it rain blood. You see there are hundreds of them fluid dripping out of their rotting necks. The cries of these entities haunt these winds. We are greatly outnumbered but we vow to kill them all. Kill them all. Oh I want to see them drop, oh them drop, them drop, them drop. So Iâll shoot them in the head, oh the head, the head, the head. Survival of the fittest oh fuck were really in it there lies a house ahead we must reach it we must defend it. Survival of the fittest only one thing we can do we must board up the doors so they cannot break through. Unfortunately this does not end happily. They've broken in weâre on our knees they bare their teeth so we bow to them. Day breaks everyoneâs dead, black in my heart rage in my head. I have become one. I have become them. I have become one. I have become them.
