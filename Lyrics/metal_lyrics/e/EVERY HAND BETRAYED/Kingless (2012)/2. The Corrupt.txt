The masses, they gather to watch me fall from the sky. I have killed all the faithful just to watch them die. I have purged this land of their wretched kin. My reign of destruction will never end. You will see my cold face just before your final breath. You will see me in flames just before youâre fucking dead.
"Is this what you wanted?" "To watch your people die?" "As they fight to better their own lives." "Is this what you wanted?" "Look what youâve fucking done!"
"How could you let this happen?" The fault is not mine to bear! They choose to kill each other! The fault is theirs! I told them what would happen if they disobey! They did not fucking listen! The fault is theirs! I wonât die! "I never said good bye..." "With this edge ill kill him!" "His crucifix is turning upside down!" Burn them all! Fucking burn them all! Burn them all! Fucking burn them all! Kill them all! Fucking kill them all! Kill them all! Fucking kill them all! "No!" I canât die! I canât...
