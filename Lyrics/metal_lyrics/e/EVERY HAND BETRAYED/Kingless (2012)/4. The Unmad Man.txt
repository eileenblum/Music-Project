I am nervous! so damn nervous! How can you call me fucking mad? It starts with the old man and his eye! So what had driven me to this, No, it wasn't anything he'd done. He was a simple kind old man. Yes, i believe it was his eye! Everywhere i look i see it staring back at me. The milky white of the moonlight his eye haunting thee! I must get rid of this, i must get rid of this, wait for the old man to fall asleep. i waited for an hour, i waited seven days and on the eighth i made my way up to his room. So patient i shall wait, the clocks are slowing down, i waited for the chance to make the final move. He lay on the ground. blood on my hands. The Heartbeat stopped, the old mans dead, i feel so peaceful now. Its time to clean this mess under the floorboards you shall stay. I heard a knocking at the door "Knock, Knock". They came in to investigate the scene. The screams were heard. I told them it was just a dream. The must know the old man is here as his heartbeat screams in my ear! I killed him! Oh god i can not take this anymore! The old mans corpse lies beneath the floor! Oh god i can not take this anymore. I am so damn nervous!
