This is for all the times you said that I would amount to nothing. All the times you said that I deserved to die. You made me hate the fucking world, turned me into this beast. Those words that fucked with my head turned my mind to stone. Only with a hollow heart for killing. This is for everyone who put me down. Bitch im coming for you. My blood ran dry as my corpse forged into this machine. A girl I loved led my soul to damnation and now the cunt is back. Id fuck razorwire before Id fuck you. This is the end of all who spit in my face. I am the nightmare you wish to never dream, and when you rest your fucking head Ill steal your life away. No matter how far you run, bitch im coming for you. You wouldnât last a month in our shoes. You wouldnât last a day living the lives we lead
What the fuck is up now?! Look at what weâve become! LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE!
