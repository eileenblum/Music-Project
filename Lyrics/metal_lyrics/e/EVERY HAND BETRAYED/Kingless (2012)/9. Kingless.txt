Your religion has misled you. Your king has led you to your death. We have been blinded by the fear that our fathers have created. Itâs time to rise up and break free from tyranny! The kings last day is growing near, no longer will we be led by fear. Itâs time to choose our fate and free ourselves His reign is over, standing up is the only chance left. The light shines no more.
The streets are filled with the blood of those who speak against,
âKill those who donât believeâ they spew from their vile lungs... Salvation lies, Salvation lies, Salvation lies, Salvation lies within your heart! So stand up, find the strength, find the will, take the step and overthrow. We are gathered here today, we are here to overthrow the king! Carve his heart from his chest, Thy monster laid to rest! Fear no more. Suffer no more.
