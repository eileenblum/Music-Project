Lend me all your ears! It came so sudden, this disease had spread upon your body infecting it with lies and deceit. You have become the follower of your own defeat. How can you just sit there and twiddle your thumbs in front of paper smiles that are easily torn. How can you just sit there and bathe in this filth a torment inside that devours your pride. This life you live is simply an abomination, your mind has been entombed as a false existence. Cleanse your veins, clear your mind, conjure that strength that been missing. Just when you thought all hope was lost you looked inside and found yourself. Its time to conquer the eternal nightmare that plagued your body with this curse. The clouds have parted the sky's are gleaming and all the glory shines above you. Your mind departs from the shore, your anchors lift from the sea these waters we shall clear, you become free. Your mind departs from the shore, your anchors lift from the sea these waters we shall clear, your soul becomes free. One chance to live your life give it all you got tonight.
