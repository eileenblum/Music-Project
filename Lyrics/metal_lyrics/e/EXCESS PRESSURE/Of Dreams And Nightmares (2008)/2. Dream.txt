In this world of hate and pain
I march against the intolerance
People don't understand it, don't like it
Don't want it but I never give up
Many managed to stay on top
'cause they've been always true and real
Sometimes when I'm lying in bed
I close my eyes and start to dream

When the moon stands high
And sheds its light
All the dark clouds disappear
Then I get up
And walk outside
To the dark night without fear

The tranquility is brilliant
Together we'll make it through
Now the time is right
To set my anger free
Many managed to stay on top
'cause they've been always true and real
Sometimes when I'm lying in bed
I close my eyes and start to dream

When the moon stands high
And sheds its light
All the dark clouds disappear
Then I get up a
And walk outside
To the dark night without fear
I see the crowd
High on a hill
And I will soon be there
I can't believe,
I realize
My friends are everywhere
