Further he walks, into the darkness
Corruption defiles as he enters the gates
Onward to fate and into the darkness
Leaving the light while his master awaits

All his life, devastation
Falling faster, endless pain
Another day, godforsaken
Slowly driving him insane

Blackened memories, neverending
Shattered body, crucified
Lifeless figure, descending
Greeting the eternal night

Further he walks, into the darkness
Corruption defiles as he enters the gates
Onward to fate and into the darkness
Leaving the light while his master awaits

Deadly Sins, deeds unspoken
Shall haunt him for eternity
No final words, no redemption
As the reaper claims his fee

A broken path, blood and ashes
Shivering he marches on
The devils pawn, demons laughing
Now reap the seeds that you have sown
