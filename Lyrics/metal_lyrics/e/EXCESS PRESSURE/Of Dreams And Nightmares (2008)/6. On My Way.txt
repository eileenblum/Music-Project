Born in the ghetto no future in life
They played with toys and I played with knifes
They are all on top, I'm chained to the ground
They swim in their money, I'm calling them out
I'll take it no longer cause I had enough
You better watch out because I am tough!

I'm on my way, try if you want
No one can stop me now!
I'm on my way, never give up
I climb the mountains straight to the top!

I spit on your money my soul is not for sale
Don't live by your rules, don't believe in your tales
I'm all out of tears, devoid of all pain
But I keep on running like thunder and rain
I'll take it no longer 'cause I had enough
You better watch out because I am tough!

I'm on my way, try if you want
No one can stop me now!
I'm on my way, never give up
I climb the mountains straight to the top!
