A sign shines in the desert
On a maze in the sand
It watches and treasures
The secret of the land

An old man approaches
For the final sacrifice
A scream, the name "Asha"!
The demon has arrived

"When the Stormrider awakens on this barren plains
He brings forth her justice and the cold desert rain!"

It's time to enter my children
The world of man at your feet
Devour everything on earth
Darkness is spreadin' its seed

No one can escape our wrath
Asha is heeding our call
It is too late, everything is over
The Blood Angel will claim all your souls!
