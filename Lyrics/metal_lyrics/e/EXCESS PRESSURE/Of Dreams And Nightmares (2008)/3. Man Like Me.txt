He was just a mad man a mad man like me
He got a lot of friends but was to blind to see
And then it happened they turned on him, what a shame
He didn't understand it, couldn't take the blame

Together he stands with all his friends
Together they take their bloody revenge
Together they fight side by side
Together they die tonight!

A few years later he remembered with fire in his eyes
And tears start to fall as he slowly realized
The sacrifice they made for him, to hard to take
And in the end he made a choice for his brothers sake

Together he stands with all his friends
Together they take their bloody revenge
Together they fight side by side
Together they die tonight!
