I see you bleeding and we're running out of time
I see you fading your face as pale as lime
I can not save you, can't bring you  back to life
Now I must leave you, my one lonely wife

I now all the answers they are running through my head
I hear these voices they almost drive me mad
They tell me don't stop they tell me leave tonight
They tell me do it and you can win the fight

A blackened landscape, a sun without no light
My soul in ruins, a neverending fight
I ride on forward, my horse it leads the way
A Quest of honor, through darkness and decay
