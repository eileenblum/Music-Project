I am power and I am pain
I am the one who is to blame
I am a beast and I am mad
I am the goblin under your bed

I'm the dream maker
It's my destiny
I'm the soul taker
And your evil dream

I am near and I'll get you soon
I will transform in the bright full moon
I am a beast and I am mad
I am the monster inside your head
