"Bloody bastard!" is all she said
As I knelt in front of her bed
I cannot take it, the pain clouds my eyes
It hurts a lot but I make a choice:

I'll set the hell on fire
I let all fires burn
I burn it down to ashes
It's the lesson she has to learn!

I close the door, get out of your life
I'm leaving this place against my own advice
Nowhere to go for one soul to sell
There is only one place, not heaven nor hell!
