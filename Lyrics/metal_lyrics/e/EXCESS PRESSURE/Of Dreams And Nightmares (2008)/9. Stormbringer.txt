He came with the winds from the east
Unleashed from the north to the west to the south
You better run!
He can hold you warm, he can freeze you like ice
Just by a word, Lord of the Storm
You better hide!

Wherever you'll go
(my black sword will sing)
You'll always remember
(the darkness I bring)
(That is my name)
I am the Stormbringer!

Now that I realize what's up to me
It's just like I thought
I can't believe
Now feel the power and might
No one survives on my side
Yes, it is true

Wherever you'll go
(the mist shall reveal)
You'll always remember
(the kiss of black steel)
(That is my fate)
I am the Stormbringer!
