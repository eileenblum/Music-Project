"...When Daylight Fades, the lust for blood wakes us!"

Argent moonlight, blazing like a torch, black flames bring me to life again
Recycling of memories, nostalgia prevails at the sight of Transylvania
the tears i cry are bitter but no help at all to ease this daily torment
I need the blood of the innocent for a state of peace you will never know

carried down the cemetery nailed in my coffin
I deny your world, FUCK YOU MORTAL!
I've been waiting for years to taste human flesh
I know the secret of eternity, WARM BLOOD!
In the dark corners of my mind torches burn with morbidity
Beneath the full moon night, MALIGNANT LUST!

miserable humanity, you spoiled my fate
I will slit your throats, one by one

A women of ordinary, strangely exiled from the sexual sphere of mankind
fascinated by morbid thoughts, she accepts the lustful vampiric embrace
The sharpness of his stare pierced her soul as he proclaimed doom
red liquid is on her neck but soon pain will eternally vanish

carried down the cemetery nailed in my coffin
I deny your world, FUCK YOU MORTAL!
I've been waiting for years to taste human flesh
I know the secret of eternity, WARM BLOOD!
In the dark corners of my mind torches burn with morbidity
Beneath the full moon night , MALIGNANT LUST!

life force is absorbed and is never to be back, blood is spilled
so much blood, like wine splattered across her white dress of purity

carried down the cemetery nailed in my coffin
I deny your world, FUCK YOU MORTAL!
I've been waiting for years to taste human flesh
I know the secret of eternity, WARM BLOOD!
In the dark corners of my mind torches burn with morbidity
Beneath the full moon night , MALIGNANT LUST!

worthless humanity, each second near you is wasted
you shall see, I'll take you all with my final fall

"you have no protection against this nightmarish dream..."
