Black symphonies of death, reflecting in my mind.
The time is time of leaving, the night is night of quiet.
In darkest shrouded time, I'm dancing with my death.
I kiss my blood-red sword, I embrace my frozen flesh.
Deliverance from life, releasing from pain.
Forever fading in dust, and in silence of this cage.
Destruction and demolition, reversing and subversion.
Disintegrate of breath, disintegrate of flesh.
And listening silence, discovering secrets,
Infirmity of thought, in the last breath in death.
And blindness of insight, as sword is kissing vein.
And silence in hearing, as mind remembers her.
I've lost my sacred love, I've lost my deepest purports.
I've lost my lunar hopes, I've lost my shining game.
Remembering her smile, remembering her face.
Remembering her hands, remembering her smell.

And remembering her voice when she was weeping dew.
And remembering her eyes when she was sleeping glad.
And remembering her life when life is ending quite.
And remembering her death when death excruciates.

This is the price of love I'll pay in its time.
This is the price of thought I paid in my life.
My love and my thought are fading in my polity.
My life and my death are fading in my insanity.
