I saw the nature of cosmos.
I have belief in obsolescence.
No res can stay forever in a form.
No one can stay.

I'm living with a theorem I discovered.
I'm dying by a secret I expose.
Who can see my insanity and brain?
Who can see my positive destruction?

I hope to insanity for salvation.
I hope to mistaking in words.
I hope to oblivion, delirium.
I hope to psychosis, stupefaction.

Forgive me if I expose these secrets.
Forgive me if I expose my words.
Forgive me if I expunge humanity.
Forgive me if I unveil this universe.
