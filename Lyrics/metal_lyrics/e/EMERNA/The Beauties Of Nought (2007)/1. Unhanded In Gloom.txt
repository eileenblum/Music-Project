Axtar! How I speak with morbid words?
My hope! How I smile in the mourner world?
My love! How I endure my dreadful thought?
My moon! How I cry in these days of droll?

Uncage your slave from the snowy noughts.
Steer Emerna to your gloomy browns.

Embrace me and kiss me,
Appease me and kill me in your love.
Tear my heart and sing how I die.
My love! I can't stay in this world of white.
Please, create a full world for this void.

Unhand me in your gloom.
