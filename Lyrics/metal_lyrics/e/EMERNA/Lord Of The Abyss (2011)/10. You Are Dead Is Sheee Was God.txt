In nowhere of thought, where meanings are growing,
I have a lost meaning, I have a lost love...
Where is my mythic love?
And where is my moon, my idol?
Her res, her exist, her nature, her meaning,
Her all is so far in existence and non existence...

I would not this destiny we wrote!
But I've not meanings in life...
I would not this destiny we wrote!
But I did for your salvation...

I'm void and nought and dead and dark.
Your exist was outwearing by me.

I would not this destiny we wrote!!
But I can feel my incoming insanity...

I'm lover, I don't want your erosion.
I'm sick, I don't want your sickness.
I'm dead, I can't see your dying.
I'm dark, I hate your darkness.

I'll stay in oath until my falling.
I'll stay in wake until my sleeping.
I'll stay in troth until my death.
I'll stay in love until my insanity.

I'll stay in drunk...
