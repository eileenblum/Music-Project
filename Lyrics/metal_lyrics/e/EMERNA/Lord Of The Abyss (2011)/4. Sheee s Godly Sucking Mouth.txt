I drank alone the poison of love with endless sacrifice.
How was sweet as she never knows is my paramour.

I burnt in my dead love's flames.
But I do envy to the heat of her lips.

I've sit in the depths of ashes, here is cold.
Until take the heat of body at the time of kiss.

And may I'll burn in her love forever.
Burning cold, with the wish of igneous lips.

I drank alone the poison of She...
How was sweet as she never knows.

I burnt in my dead love's flames.
But I do envy to her lips.

I've sit in the depths of ashes.
Until take the heat of body for kiss.

And I will burn in her love.
Cold, with the wish of igneous lips...

... she never knows is my paramour!
... she never knows is my love!
