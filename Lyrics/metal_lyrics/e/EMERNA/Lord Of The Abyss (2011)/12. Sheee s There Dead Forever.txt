On hatchings of moonless nights.
I wait in the cage of shadows.
I know there is moonlight.

I wait to hear her voice again.
That hymns to the lights of moon.

I know she is out of shadows...

I can't see!
I rend shadows by sword with tears.

But I am a shadow imprisoned in depths of myself...

I know she is there...
