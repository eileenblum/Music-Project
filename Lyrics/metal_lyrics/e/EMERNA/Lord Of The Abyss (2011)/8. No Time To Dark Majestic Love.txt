The deep sacrosanct dejection in my dark majestic love.
A blackest sightless silence smites my so soft slothful screams.

Researching in nought-lands, the gracious lost rays of moon.
And wending mourner, the lightless endless aimless path...

With no truth and lie I think to my untruth and unreal exist.
With grief and tear and fear I sleep in a dreamlike bosom of who is away.

With wound and sword and blood I battle inside of me against myself of dead.
With no and no and no and no and not I answer the life's uncaused questions.

Where is my lost ray?

Far away I know so far away in nought...

In void, in fiction, in delusion.
In portrait, in song, in poem, in mind.

Far away in me so far away in me...
