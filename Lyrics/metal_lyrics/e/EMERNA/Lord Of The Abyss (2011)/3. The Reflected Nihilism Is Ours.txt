His dark chalet's cuckoo clock stops.
And the fifth season becomes eternal for him.

Time had seized the prize of his face and body.
And left him in depths of his lost intellectuality.

Winds of salvation didn't laugh in that season.
And nature had sang only the myth of his season.

He had been imprisoned in dead brain of nature's songs.
Imprisoned, abandoned in unheard myth of nihility...
