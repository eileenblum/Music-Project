My Star! Do laugh... here is Eden.
I'm man, you're me and lodge's a den.

My Star! Do laugh... they all are gone.
And I've heard your screams you were so lone.

My Star! Believe in your true love.
Forgive them all... you're gracious like dove.

My Star! Do laugh... the night is thine.
Do blink to moon... for gloom... please do shine.

My Star! Remind you did suicide.
My Star! But there's no way to hide.
My Star! I was dying in your bide.
My Star! Please be have my side...

My Star! I feel my painful absence.
My Star! I'm gloom I need a sense.
My Star! I'm scared of this distance.
My Star! How should I wish your glance?

My Star! No one left in my life.
My Star! I've no more hope to knife.
My Star! Nought has growing rife.
My Star! Am I worthy to relief?

My Star! I'm dancing in your hell.
My Star! I've nothing new to tell.
My Star! I'm trapped in a mental cell.
My Star! You may rend that shell.

My Star! Don't look at this white age.
My Star! I'll destroy the world's cage.
My Star! I'm Satan on the stage.
My Star! I'm gloom... I'm god... I'm sage.

My Star! You're only one!! you're no one!!
My Star! You're everyone!! you're none!!
My Star! Before you I'm so lone.
My Star! My death is done...

Har che bar ou migozarad aayeneh tekraar konad
Kist yeki mast cho man khandeh be asraar konad
Pardeh baroftadeh chonin az 'adan ingouneh bebin
Kaz 'adam aayad be miyaan 'eshgh cho raftaar konad
Maa ke be aaghoushe 'adan taa'er o touti-sefatim
Saahebe fardis kojaa raft ke goftaar konad
'omri az an 'omr ke shod talkh-dahan boudam o nak
Sibe derakht mikhoram taa shekar as`haar konad
Rouz o shab az charkhe zamaan rafteh ze tasvire makaan
Shaah o khodaavand manam kist ke enkaar konad
Tondiye taghzil bebin lowh o ghalam khasteh ze yad
Kondiye hejraan benegar vasl cho peykaar konad
Daayereh bi-khat shod o man shekle behesht dideh-am
Noghteh Emerna shod o bas mo'jezeh pargaar konad

... and again I laugh and say the game is over my love!!
Can you tell me for what you want to take your vengeance?
If you kill 'em all then alone on earth what you will to do?
No I do not ask you to endure just leave 'em all in the grave of ignorance ...

Now may I ask you again? Setar!
