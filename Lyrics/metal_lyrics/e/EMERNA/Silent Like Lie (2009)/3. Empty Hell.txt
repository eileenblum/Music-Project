Imprisoned for ever in the ruins of veracity.
I buried torn thirst of being in your side, Deathmetallish...
Convicted to honest and abandoned in gloom.
Sunken in brown of the grave you graved for me to vanish...
"No beauty is everlasting"... but not yours in my eyes.
Even after you closed them when you shamed of your hatred...
Lie eternal in Eden... I pray for you in your hell.
In love I've never asked for an evidence just a shred...
My silent laugh was the ending of silence now I'm the dark.
For what you burn my heart I have nothing seared to burn...
I died to keep my love alive but how you leave us alone so lone!
I stand asleep on the point of the circle I wheel and you turn...

Let me think more...
When had you gone and how did you done?

Take my life... my darling!
I'm suffering inflames in a corner I crawl.
Leave me raw in deliverance.
I'll be saved forever frozen frost.
In the winter of your love.
Sunken in silence and locked into sob.

Forever paused in every moment.
Unhanded into gloom... somewhere behind the end.

With the wind is gone my mind.
I veil my heart beneath the crust.

Let me know where you are.
Where...
