... of this paradise,
I'm afraid of this nought, this heaven.
Staring insane to a deadness.
Alone in the midst of a countless mass.
Beholding my endless fracture,
After that moment I tried to live for once, just.
I accept the inaction of all scars.
For I'm sure about my silence and your ears.
I feel I'm lying you all.

Reborning of all dreams needs,
The two tired and closed eyes...
In nought... in gloom... in silence,
This life abhided in lies...
I know for what you're dying.
You lived enough in dreams...
Come to me to feel what I feel.
The silence of all our screams...
I know what's wrong with the world.
But I don't care about what I know...
My wiser doubts were truly.
When truth digressed in your show...
I'm liar I love lying you.
Like silence that hides the truth...
Just leave me alone in gloom.
I do not need your silly ruth...

Now I'd left you riant in your spaceless cage in your world your lands...
Stay eternal for ever and pay no attention to my laughs... Alright?
