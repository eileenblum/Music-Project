And still I'm talking with no one...
Before me who was wistful beside you on the road?

But still I'm talking with no one...
As I remind you my darling,
How riant we were ostensive when you backed.

But still I'm walking with no one...
And I close my eyes.
You knew the road was out of the circle.
You knew that deviance.

It's the same road you'll find it someday when I'm lost into end.
But still I'm feeling the time and space... in another kind.

I stare senseless to unchangeable repeats.
How many times I have to die? I have to live?

I do belong to nought... neither Eden nor hell.
Let me close my eyes... I can't see nothing.

Hope to stay in dreams forever and ever.
Hope to lose the truth.
Hope to deadness of wake.
Hope to insanity... my desire.

Let me close my eyes... I can't see nothing.
Let me drown into vast width... let me laugh to life.
Let me feel the inaction... let me know I'm dead.
Let me see your dream... let me find your room.

How should I sing for you? please... my king!
I am coming to reborn but you are leaving to be dead.

I oath to my name... there's no way out for me.
I'm slave and saved forever in gloom.

You are well gone... I will sleep.
Goodbye my darling... it's alright...
