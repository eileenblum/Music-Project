The blood is food is flesh is grass is water is air is photon is phone...

Splash of a father into the machine of a mother.
The result is a growing worm not a miracle.
Believe in your nature.
Believe and stop this aimless conversion.
Stop in now and drown the gleam into my absolute gloom.

Disharmonic existence of an infinite cage.
Compassion of rays in this darkest age.

I can see their gleam, their outwearing gleam.
My frozen shadow and your darkening beam.

We are abandoned we left ourselves.
At the time of birth in this empty sphere.

Deny me my love! Emerna!! cancel me, please.
Drown my gleam into thy gloomy embrace.
