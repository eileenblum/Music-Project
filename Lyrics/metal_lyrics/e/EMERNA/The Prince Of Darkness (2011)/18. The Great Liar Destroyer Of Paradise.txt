I am destroyer of paradise, a lengthening gloom on your hell.
I want to dark your mirage with griminess of reality.

Do not be a silly slave, reject me now, reject me.
I am that infinite blackness, I am Emerna, I am lie...

Listen to the cardiograph, yes you're stopping with clarity.
The time is still dancing and you are examined on bed, away and calm.

Can you hear me? where are you going?
Where are you now? where?

Suspension is begun...

Countless times I said and you were apathetic.
Death and birth are just parts of a passage, remember?

Where are beauties you sought?
Where is purports?
Can you feel my words?
I think not.
Goodbye my slave...

Suspension is done.
