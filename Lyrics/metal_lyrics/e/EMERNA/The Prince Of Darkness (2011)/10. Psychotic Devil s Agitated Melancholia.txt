And I feel this breakdown of time...
The squalor of memories.
Nothing is real except the unreal.

Just living in a past forgotten.
Just staring at a paused time.

Where we are is so huahaa beautiful,
But the dirt is in my brain!!

I hate you all...

For me in that silence was death and only death.
Could you hear me? no you couldn't.
You all are deaf, you all are deaf.

You all are asleep worms,
In nowhere of my grave to eat my dreams.
To dry my tears, to thieve my ears,
To seize my wills and to kill my feel, aren't you?

I'll rive your heads, I'll cut your necks.
I'll drink your blood and I'll eat your flesh.
I'll rend your hearts, I'll snatch your eyes.
I'll fuck your loves and I'll watch your smash.

I need your crash to watch your flour.
In bloody shore of your decanter whore.
I'm sure you'll drown in uretic seas.
When I want to kill you stupid feas.

Damn you all...

Sometimes I've fear from absence of life.
And sometimes I stare at bloodstained on knife.

Sometimes I'm dead when I drown into nought.
And sometimes I ask where are beauties I sought?

Sometimes I pray for something like love.
Sometimes I die and sometimes I fly.

Sometimes I know there is nothing more than gloom...
But sometimes I cry I've fear from this doom.

Sometimes I dance with rakish rays of darkness...
And sometimes I sleep on bloody breast of blackness.

Sometimes I search a world out of sight.
And sometimes I wish for mourning in the night...

Sometimes I lost, I lost myself I think.
And sometimes I find, I find myself so sick.

Sometimes I drift, I wrest myself in a cycle...
And sometimes I see that's nothing just a cypher.

Sometimes I want, I wish to back again.
But sometimes I remind renewal of this chain...

Sometimes I need, I need to live in lightness.
And I suddenly remember I'm no one... yeah, lightless...
