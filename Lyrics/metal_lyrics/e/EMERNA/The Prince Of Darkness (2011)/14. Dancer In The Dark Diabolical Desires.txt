I'm dancing with gray flames of love, I'm crying.
I remember my thought and my sickness, I'm dancing.
I'm dying in my forgotten corner of insanity, I'm crying.
I'm destroying myself in an inner fight, and still I am dancing.

In lost night of love, in myth and dream,
In moon and grief, in dark and cruelty,
In lover's sickness, in grandeur of sweetheart,
In shame of insanity, in this disgrace of dark,
In dancing with flames, in dying in grief,
In corner of tears, in lost night of love,
In all meanings of lost, I can see my insanity,
I can see my sickness, and I can see just regret...

Blood, tear, grief, in my dancing...
