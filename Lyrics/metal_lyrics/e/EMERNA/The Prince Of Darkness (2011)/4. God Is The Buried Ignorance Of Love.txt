My hist harm! Do laugh... here is Eden.
I'm man, you're me and lodge's a den.
My hist harm! Do laugh... they all are gone.
And I've heard your screams you were so lone.
My hist harm! Believe in your true love.
Forgive them all... you're gracious like dove.
My hist harm! Do laugh... the night is thine.
Do blink to moon... for gloom... please do shine.

My hist harm! Remind you did suicide.
My hist harm! But there's no way to hide.
My hist harm! I was dying in your bide.
My hist harm! Please be have my side.
My hist harm! I feel my painful absence.
My hist harm! I'm gloom I need a sense.
My hist harm! I'm scared of this distance.
My hist harm! How should I wish your glance?
My hist harm! No one left in my life.
My hist harm! I've no more hope to knife.
My hist harm! Nought has growing rife.
My hist harm! Am I worthy to relief?
My hist harm! I'm dancing in your hell.
My hist harm! I've nothing new to tell.
My hist harm! I'm trapped in a mental cell.
My hist harm! You may rend that shell.
My hist harm! Don't look at this white age.
My hist harm! I'll destroy the world's cage.
My hist harm! I'm Satan on the stage.
My hist harm! I'm gloom... I'm god... I'm sage.
My hist harm! You're only one!! you're no one!!
My hist harm! You're everyone!! you're none!!
My hist harm! Before you I'm so lone.
My hist harm! My death is done...

... and again I laugh and say the game is over my love!!
Can you tell me for what you want to take your vengeance?
If you kill 'em all then alone on earth what you will to do?
No I do not ask you to endure just leave 'em all in the grave of ignorance.

Now may I ask you again?
