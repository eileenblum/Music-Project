I saw the man and beast.
There was many resemblances.
I had to withdraw this difference... the intellect.

I am here to burn thy light.
To take your cheery sight.
My name is E006.
The messenger of nought...

Here is a place for my screams and fears.
Here is a void for our piss and tears.

Here is a cage and nowhere is my dream.
Yes here is an infinite full of ingredients.

0 1 0 0 0
O 0 1 0 0
O O 0 1 0
O O O 0 1 ...

Incredible shape of gloomy vacuum.
Planets in nuclides, zero and one, emptiness...

An I/O nature, a sexual mass, an unfathered birth.
Transfiguration... huahaa...

I felt a terrific variance.
Resumption, destruction, mutation, discordance.

Do not be a holy beast, you are a res.
Stay with fray and behold your flour.

Behold your flour in a nowhere full of ingredients...
