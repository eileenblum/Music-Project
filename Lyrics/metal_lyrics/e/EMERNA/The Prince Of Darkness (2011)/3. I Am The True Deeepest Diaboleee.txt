Your musing gaze to the sphere, renewed all the frays in me.
And silence is screaming still, as I try to ask you to be.

I wonder at my suicide in Eden.
In fear the gloom of the wheel is hidden.

And still I laugh to your silent shame.
I told you all that's over the game.

The game is over... huahaa...

Alone in corners of my infinite sight.
Staring in silence to weaken of light.

Screaming so hopeless in darkness a name.
I'm fractured in the clash of the rain and flame.

I burn the written fate and I lie in dust.
... and how the lunatic star seared my lust!

Do not behold to my shameful loneliness.
For I've lost even myself now in this emptiness...

Woe...
I'll be truly forever even after you deceived the truth...
