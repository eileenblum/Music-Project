Obsolescence and erosion of breath.
Staring to the existence of a life.

Unresting by meaning of death.
Discovering dim purports of real.

Departing to a silence unheard.
And merging with a positive erosion.

Condemning all visions and dreams.
It's the time of exception of destruction.

It's the moment I ascribe that to death.
It's leaving perceptions of life.

It's stroll in disharmonic ingredient.
It's the time of departure to the void.

And expiring sixth sense and sensation.
And smiling to the universe operation.

And asking for reasons of essence.
And weeping for beauties of life.

Recollecting perceptions moribund.
Recollecting hate and grief and joy.

Recollecting sounds and words and hues.
Recollecting love and night and moon.

Believing mechanism subversion.
Elemental analysis transformer.

Beholding demising perceptions.
Unhanding obscuring definitions.

Perceptions are fading by exhaustion.
In this moment of swift as half-blink.

And how many a dead has poetries of death-time.
But no one will ever hear them...
And however this life has not beauty.
And however this century and history have not.

And however the existence and cosmos have not.
But I am generating my beauties in nought.

Because I am a homo and we have the brain.
We lived by words we devised for thousands of years.
We translated physical acts by our figurative intellects.
And now we have a limited figurative world.

Death to the existence!!
Death to me!!!
