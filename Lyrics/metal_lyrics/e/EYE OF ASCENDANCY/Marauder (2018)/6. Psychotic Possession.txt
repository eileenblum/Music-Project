Fire
The vortex descends
The void unleashes its fury, engulfing cities in flames
Burn, with the like of your species
All planets before, blown to pieces
If you were strong enough to survive the initial blast
Your mind is swarmed with distorted nightmares of the past
Your bodily chemistry changed, psychotic possession
De-evolution to deranged
Run, flee
You see the bodies of loved ones were slain by your hand
Gutting the children to nourish the land
You have become the behemoth undead
Kill everything
Fire!
The void unleashes its fury, engulfing cities in flames
Burn, with the like of your species
All planets before, blown to pieces
If you were strong enough to survive the initial blast
Your mind is swarmed with distorted nightmares of the past
Your bodily chemistry changed, psychotic possession
De-evolution to deranged
Probe you
