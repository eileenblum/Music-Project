Awaken, our master rises from his chrysalis
All eyes upon thee, all heads shall bow
An ever looming shroud of darkness pierces all around
The ground trembles, the earth it quakes
His armies pass through the crystal gates
The sky erupts with torturous lightning
The marching stops and our lord bellows
Ah my children, gaze upon your creator
March my children, go forth and break their foundation
Bring me the severed heads
Ensure that all the humans are dead
I have seen many kingdoms grow, I have witnessed them all fall
Waging war on another, conscious killing of your brothers
A disgusting excuse for a species
I will tear this world to pieces
Burn everything to the ground, fill the skies with torturous screams
March on their cities, feed on the weak
