Herald the sickness, I am disease
I will do with your life as I please
When the skies are cascading red
I will prepare this planet where all are dead
Dead to me
All of their lifeless corpses ornamenting the trees
Killing all that you have loved, and then you
I am filled with an endless rage, of this worthless race I turn the page
My acknowledgment has come to fruition
I have come to bear my masters mission
Bring forth your champions
You should know all your leaders will die
Prophetic visions of the end are the only thing that stay my mind
I was not born from this place, a social experiment born from an ancient race
I will become the marauder
My sole existence bred for slaughter
