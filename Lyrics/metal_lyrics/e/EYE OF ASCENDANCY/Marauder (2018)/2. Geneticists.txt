The gate opens and a silhouette appears
Your mind is open, and is giving into fear
Awakened with a distant memory of pain, of the life that you once lived
Eyes wide open but your body laying motionless
But your mind is still yet sane
Probing you
Awakened with a distant memory of pain but your mind is still yet sane
Devices to promote ascension
Probing you
Genetically reconfigured, torturously

The skull is fractured to give access to the brain
You're wide awake, to ensure you feel the pain

Slicing, dicing, strip away imperfections
Hacking, slashing, inspire evolution

Your body forced through metamorphosis
The gate opens, and a silhouette appears
