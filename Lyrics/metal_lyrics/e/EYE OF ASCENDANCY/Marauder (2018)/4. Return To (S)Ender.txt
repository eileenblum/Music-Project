Rift walker, we gaze upon your brilliance
Soul stalker, destroyer of resilience
Pierce my mind, look deep at my soul
This humble vessel, your body to control
World breaker, life taker
I've grown tired of mortality
Strip me of flesh and the world I know
My life essence I surrender to your throne
I come forth to be used in many ways
First and foremost grant me the title bringer of the end of days
Anoint my flesh with your power of possession
Exalted one
I've completed my task
Since my creation, I've done what you've asked
This wretched place, this empty space
I wish to come home, I beg of you
Rift walker, denier of the heaven sent
Soul stalker, defiler of the innocent
Pierce my mind, look deep at my soul
This humble vessel, your body to control
World breaker, life taker
I've grown tired of mortality
Strip me of flesh and the world I know
My life essence I surrender to your throne
I come forth to be used in many ways
First and foremost grant me the title bringer of the end of days
Anoint my flesh with your power of possession
Return me to
To the void
