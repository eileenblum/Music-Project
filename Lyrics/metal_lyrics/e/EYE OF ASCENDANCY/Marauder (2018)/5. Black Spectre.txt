War, pain, pestilence
There will be agony
Watch you run to the shepherd, only to find the slaughtered sheep
Fall to your knees and pray for release
All behold the death from beneath
The sky opens up, but god isn't there
God, you're a worthless coward who couldn't be found
You sent your sheep to the serpent
The human race rotting above ground
All hail the worthless coward who couldn't be found
You sent your sheep to the serpent
The human race rotting above ground
Watch you run to the shepherd, only to find the slaughtered sheep
Fall to your knees and pray for release
All behold the death from beneath
The sky opens up, but god isn't there
God, you're a worthless coward who couldn't be found
You sent your sheep to the serpent
The human race rotting above ground
The black serpent has risen
