The orb descends from the heavens or what you think them to be
For he who discovers the relic of abandon
Will be consumed with rage and ascend to power you can't imagine
But do not be confused, for the eye will shape and mold him
To the will of my master
Disfigured, contorted
Beyond your mind
The energy of the sphere begins to bind
Reconstructing the DNA
Your mortal leaders urge all of mankind to pray
Obelisk of torment
Tormented relic
Tormentor
Behemoth, consume
Phase consumption
Your mortal leaders urge all of mankind to pray
Consumed in flame
