Peer beyond the cosmic veil and open up your mind to see
Earth was not the sole objective
When you look to the sky and witness other planets burn
For the first time in your life, realize the true form of malevolence
Interdimensional conquest
To command obedience
Cosmic debauchery
The galactic pathways, are paved with the fluids of the defiant
Take this as your last warning to all neighboring colonies
This will be your death if you do not submit
The stars will bleed
The creator will feed
The galactic causeways are obstructed with the plight of sentient life
Peer beyond the cosmic veil and open up your mind to see
Earth was not the soul objective
When you look to the sky and witness other planets burn
For the first time in your life, realize the true form of malevolence
Interdimensional conquest
To command obedience
Cosmic debauchery
