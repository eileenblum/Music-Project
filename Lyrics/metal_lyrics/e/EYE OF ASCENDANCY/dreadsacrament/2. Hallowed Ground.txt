Enter the vessel of our construct of time
Undergo nebulous embodiment
To unlock your mind
To our concept of time

Behold the keepers of time and space
Restless guardians of this hallowed place
Nameless, and faceless
Shapeless abnormalities influenced by the patterns of creation of light
The destruction of life

The force of a black hole
Runs rampant through your psyche
Dissolving the past from the present
Leaving but a shell behind,
The minds casket

New understanding is incomprehensible
The knowledge you obtain is beyond human principle
Synapses of your brain rapidly firing into oblivion

The agonizing separation
Of soul and flesh
A lurker of the hallow
Is all thatâs left

Twisted, contorted
One with the hallows
You will never return
Home
