We are the children from the pariah
We were spawned from his blood
The messiah
Spawned from the depths
And itâs cruel intentions
As legion, we have come to sate the voids desire
Our arrival signified by the black moon in the sky

Swarming all around you ripping right through all your flesh and bone
The darkness spreads inside you
This agony will be your home

Youâll be assimilated
Into his armies
Into his armada of destruction

We are the children from the pariah
We were spawned from his blood
The messiah
Spawned from the depths
And itâs cruel intention

We are the end of light

The design of life is a gift not a right
Of which can be taken any night
The vehement shrouding of the sun
The reaping has begun

We are the pestilence of the nether realm
Youâll be the substance to our deity
When you look around
And all you see, is the dead bodies
Of the ones who failed
Or the ones who have lost all
Will to live

*my child, come to me*

Seek solace in me
Seek solace in death
Seek solace in him
