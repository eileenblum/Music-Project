Iâm becoming the beast thus is my burden
Hundreds of years ago I left our world
To assume my place
With the astral flame
These lamentations of this torment
I can not contain

Iâm becoming the leech
Thy sustenance being creation
Devoid of acceptance
To become the breaker is my penance

Burn into me
Let the taker of lifeâs embrace consume me
The eclectic convolutions
Of our filthy, wretched minds
We must become a Wraith in time

We will become conquerors
Of time itself, Wraith
This is our destiny

The rift eye opens, and gazes into the unclean
I hear the voices surround me
But his motives are yet to be seen
Trials of a cold and dead world

The time has come
The nether is calling to me

Purge
Collect the soul for repurposing
And everything else can
Burn

Raise our sigil to the sky
Marking our path in the cosmos
