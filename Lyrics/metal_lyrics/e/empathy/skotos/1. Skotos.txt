Get me out to the gate of skotos

Princes in black
I need your love
Come to my place
Saw me your face

Touch me again
I must escape
I need your love
Iâll pay in blood

I see crimes I see madness,
My heart is a gift for darkness
Creatures come to give me power
Skotos is the first step for a murder

Scotos, scotos, scotos

Here is so dark
Please take me back
To go away
From skotos gate

I see crimes I see madness,
My heart is a gift for darkness
Creatures come to give me power
Skotos is the first step for a murder

I don't believe in destiny
I have no life
I don't believe in destiny
I am blind

Skotos will never go away from my eyes
The temple of chaos is open for lies
Nails and horns was painted from blood
My eyes are crying my spirit is flying
My last time is coming my body is dying
