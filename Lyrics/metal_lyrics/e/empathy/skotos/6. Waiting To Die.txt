[Bonus Track][Verse 1]
HATE
For the people around me
For the fucking lays that they
SAY
Promising fake dreams
WORDS
That is empty and cold
And were never mend to be
TOLD
Giving me my lost hope

[Verse 2]
DEATH
Is what matters the most
By the time you are born in this
WORLD
Waiting to die
DREAMS
Turn to nightmares, shadows
Ghosts, giving me
PAIN
With no solution

[Chorus]
Hatred growing in my mind
Killing madness makes me blind
Drown my last hopes into blood
This world will soon be destroyed
By the evil, that rules my life
Waiting to die

Tell me lies, empty words
Spending time for no cause
Drown my last hopes into blood
This world will soon be destroyed
By the worms that eat your life
Waiting to die

[Verse 3]
PAIN
In my head in my body
My fears take place
TONIGHT
In my brain
HATE
For the people around me
The fucking lays that they
SAY
Waiting to die

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat verse 2]
