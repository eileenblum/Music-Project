There Is A Place
Under The Earth
Takes Many Souls
After The End

The Underworld Place
Rotting My Flesh
I Canât Feel
Because Iâm Dead

My Row Has Come
To Take Me Down
In The Underworld Place
Donât Have a Crown

The Underworld Place
Rotting My Flesh
I Canât Feel
Because Iâm Dead

Dust In My Mind
Fire In My Body
Hereâs My Pain
Hereâs My Country

The Underworld Place
Rotting My Flesh
I Canât Feel
Because Iâm Dead

Waiting To Die
Because I Exist
I canât Save My Self
I Am The Beast

I Donât Dream
Behold My Destruction
Now My Sight Is
Other Construction

Nothing exist
Emptiness fills
My haunted thoughts
My darkest dreams
