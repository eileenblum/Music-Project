I AM IN PAIN AND IâM CRYING
FEELING THAT IâM NOT ALIVE
ALL THE NIGHTMARES OF MY SOUL
KEPT VIVID ALL ALONG

THE NIGHTMARES OF MY SOUL
WERE ALWAYS ALIVE
IâVE TRIED TO FORGET
BUT THEY STILL REMEMBER ME

MY LIFE IN DARKNESS
NEVER SAW THE LIGHT
SEARCHING FOR A SIN
A SIGN SO TRUE

THE NIGHTMARES OF MY SOUL
WERE ALWAYS ALIVE
IâVE TRIED TO FORGET
BUT THEY STILL REMEMBER ME

MY NIGHTMARES ARE HERE
MY SADNESS IS REAL
LEAVING WAS WRONG
GETTING AWAY FROM ALL
NOW GETTING THEIR REVENGE

MY HEART BEATS FAST
HEARING DEADLY SCREAMS
BUT CAN NEVER FIND PEACE
EVEN IF THERE ARE SO QUITE

MY NIGHTMARES ARE HERE
MY SADNESS IS REAL
LEAVING WAS WRONG
GETTING AWAY FROM ALL
NOW GETTING THEIR REVENGE

LEAVING WAS WRONG
GETTING AWAY FROM ALL
LEAVING WAS WRONG
NOW GETTING THEIR REVENGE

I WILL NEVER FIND MY PEACE
I STILL KNOW WHAT TO DO EXPECT
MAYBE IâLL GET THROUGH IT
EVEN MY SOUL IS DEAD)
