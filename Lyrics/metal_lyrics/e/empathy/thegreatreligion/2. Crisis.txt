Around us hate is spreading 
inside us love is bleeding 
in this world everything is wrong 
and evil has covered our souls 

Crisis and justice will come for all 
salvation has emerged from chaos and war 
religions are trying but offer no dreams 
humanity waiting for another king 

Today the sun is hiding from darkness 
the moon will rise and loose its brightness 
the earth has razed but here comes God 
the punishment of Him is hard 

Lies and prayers fight 'till the end 
hoping that will all stay dead 
the earth has painted red 
everywere people are screaming for help 

Innocents souls embracing the sky 
only the sinners are staying alive 
the purity has gone ahead is the dark 
this war just begun 

Today the sun is hiding from darkness 
the moon will rise and loose its brightness 
the earth has razed but here comes God 
the punishment of Him is hard 

Lies and prayers fight 'till the end 
hoping that will all stay dead 
the earth has painted red 
everywere people are screaming for help 

[Repeat chorus 2]

Around us hate is spreading 
inside us love is bleeding 
in this world everything is wrong 
and evil has covered our souls
