In front of my eyes, death is coming closer 
surounded by blackness, the sun feels so cold. 
I feel nothing, no life no hope 
hard to breathe, death is a long trip. 

Loosing my senses, it's time to find peace 
a coffin is my home, nothing has left to live. 
It's silence here, can't listen to my screams 
can't smell the fear, all is left are my sins. 

After the pain, comes the cure, 
after the storm, the rain is pure. 
Today my spirit delivered to you, 
here is my final attitude. 

No regrets of anything i've done. 
No feelings for all i love is lost. 
No guilts for my fucking faults. 
before i die, no hope, no thoughts
