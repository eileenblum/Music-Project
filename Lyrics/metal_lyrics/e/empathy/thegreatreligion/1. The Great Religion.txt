The Great Religion 

In the swamps of greed. 
the slaves of the gold. 
preparing the chosen one. 
against the human beings. 

Men who joined with wrath 
Away from the light. 

Slaves of the sleepless 
Baits of the darkness 

Like an owl in the night 
Watching through the darkness 
Men of the white desert 
Are ready to have a feast. 

There is no hope for survival 
They are in lethargy, 
without any thoughts. 
Waiting for their fate. 

Like a snake they are waiting 
in the path of faith 

They wear a shining smile 
to bring the satan in our home 

Everyone will have their role 
in the theater of death 
In a black backround 
we create our dreams. 

Lies, wrath and shadows. 
will replace our souls. 
Do not think, not feel. 
The others will be there for you. 

Fake words and false dilemmas. 
To bring the great religion. 
Fake words and false dilemmas. 
In a shrinking world that leads to death.
