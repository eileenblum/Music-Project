[Verse 1]
Spirits of another world
Dancing on our fears
The bodies lie down
Cold and dead

[Chorus]
Rotten corpses all around
Listen and you'll hear no sound
Necrosis
Feeling death on all its grace
In your eyes, I see his face
Necrosis

[Verse 2]
Feel the pain
Again my friend
See you around
In a heavenly sound

[Repeat chorus]

[Verse 3]
Look around
Death and pain
Why?
All for nothing
And nothing for all
Why?

Necrosis
One more time
