Night. Sleeping London dreams away
In a bloody veil
Shadows of the lonely streets came
And He turned into hunter

Night blessed me
God impressed me
Iâm Creator and youâre my workpiece
Knife affects me
Iâm inspired with
Warm flesh calling for kiss

And gloomy events filled with passion his mind 
He is painter of blood and alive substance
Scarlet pictures on bed, awful beauty in head 
He will not forget what he saw once

Beast, you are thinking that youâre right
It is not true!
I, I can show you the bright side
In this dark Rule

Night blessed us
Blood impressed us
Come to me and Iâll give you glory 
I affect you
I prepare you 
The Day of Reckoning came

Stay with me
Feel with me
Enternal 
Agony!
