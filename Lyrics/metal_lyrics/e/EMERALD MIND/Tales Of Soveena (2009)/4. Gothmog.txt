Under the stars, before Moon rose
Feanor crossed the sea
Guided by furious light
Of stolen Silmarils

Echo was spreading at the fiord
And flame touched the sky
With light of Aman in bright eyes
They came!

Stay strong 
Compress brave into fist
Lead your 
People through bloody mist!
Do not 
Give fury to blind yourself!
Feanor!
They will not dance on your grave!

In darken vaults of Angband
Under Thangorodrim
The mighty demon of the night arose
With hellish scream!

He holds a title of the Lord
Of Orc-Hosts and Barlogs
He wields black axe and flaming whip
His name is Gothmog!

Under the stars, before Moon rose
Feanor crossed the sea
Guided by furious light
Of stolen Silmarils

Echo was spreading at the fiord
And flame touched the sky
With light of Aman in bright eyes
They died!
