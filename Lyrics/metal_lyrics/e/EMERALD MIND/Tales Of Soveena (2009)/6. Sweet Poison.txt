Empty blood
Flowing though your veins
Without doubt
I will share my sin

Timid sigh! 
Feeling of the wise!
Endless life!
Beauty! Want to try it?

This is all open door on your own
Radiate heat for me and for Universe

Fragrant fruit
From the dying tree. 
Lonely brute! 
Iâll care about your fear.

My beloved
Bound up with blood!
Lay with me
All eternity!
