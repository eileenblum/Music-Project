Leave it alone
You donât have to say these words
I know it on my own
Thereâs no way to turn back
And save us from darkness!

Last breath of air
In this war of hatred thereâs no winner
Only Death
Rules this scene
Burn our mind and take us to madness

Clouds donât stop crying
Barren land tired from trifling mankind
Seems this world is dying
Can you see hope on this lifeless sight?

Please donât cry
All will end soon
Do you see those lights?...
