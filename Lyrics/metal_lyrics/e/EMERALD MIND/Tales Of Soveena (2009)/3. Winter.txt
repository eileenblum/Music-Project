Dusk and leaden clouds are laying above my head and silent thoughts
Oh, Innocent snow falls down on the dirty ruins and sinful earth 
Strong blizzard can bend a steel and indefinite virgin mind
Lost in snowy wood, waiting for cold embrace of Mother Ice

Drawing on ice glass
My endless lifelines
I try to touch your passion at dusk time
Donât delete your purity
Twinkle of pictures
The forest creatures
Pines, birches, aspens
In white dresses
Opening your destiny

Frost winter hid this corrupted world by whiteness
People are lost and do not guess 
My forecast â I see the way, I am lookout
Please, love me in frozen emptinessâ¦ everywhere

Wind blows through a snow, tenderly touches my hair and gives me rest
Oh, how can I know: Is this a quiet relief or awful death?
Time calls to resist, destroy ignorance â no more defense
Pride adorns the Wise! 
Like sparkle in the rime, letâs give them shine!

Drawing on ice glass
My forced lifelines
I keep my passion to create perfection 
Donât delete your purity
Investigating
Invisible traces 
Owls, leopards, tigers
On white earth
Wise define your destiny

Frost winter hid this corrupted world by whiteness
People are lost and do not guess 
My forecast â I see the way, I am lookout
Please, love me in frozen emptinessâ¦ everywhere

The winter may call you by the quiet harmony
But something deep inside of you continues to live
The hoarfrost on the window will be glitter for a long time
So go into infinity and make your soul to shine!
