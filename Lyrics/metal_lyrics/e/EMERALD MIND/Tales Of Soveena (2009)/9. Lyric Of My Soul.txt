Since I remember myself
I have always admired the sky
And breath of setting sun

And all this years I was trying 
To figure out the meaning of mine
For what we live and die?

Hold me close
My sweet sadness
All my thoughts guide me
To madness!
How I wish to clear my mind!

Clock on the wall
Ticking on and on
Measuring our lives

Routine day by day
Standard holiday
Donât have time
For words to say

This life is like dirty pool 
We drown down like fools!
But inside we scared are toâ¦escape

I wanna be little child playing 
Games with my friends till the night
Iâm still a lonely dreaming child

Hold me close
My sweet sadness
All my thoughts guide me
To madness!
How I wish to clear my mind!

My sweet, I love you more than life! Give me your hand!
I'm fallen leaf! Take me away to shining land!
Where clear sky and ocean winds blowing my hair!
Where we could fly and world would not be so unfair!

And we all play this game  
Some with proud   
Some with shame   
In the end 
Letâs break lie!
Who we are
In this complicated life!
