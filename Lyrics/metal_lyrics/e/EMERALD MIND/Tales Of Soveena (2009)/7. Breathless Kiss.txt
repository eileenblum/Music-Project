Fading sun left a place to the silver Queen
Nightingales stopped to sing     
All I wish, all I dream is your sensual hug
But my skin is so cold laying under ground

Forever lost for morning light
Beg for the moon in lonely night

Ancient runes, mystic signs are covering my skin 
Vial is filled with blood. Ritual begins.
Iâm so real, so alive, walking through bloody mist
But your heart will be burned by my breathless kiss
