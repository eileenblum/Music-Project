Once in moonless night
Unfaithful soul touched the forces 
That should be unknown!

Crew turned into ghosts
What may be worse 
Than to wander expecting forgiveness?!

Bloody sail 
You can see in fog on the water
Restless souls
Looking for a road to their home

Cry of frantic storm
Waves of the howl
Damnation threw ship into void!

Look! There on skyline!
Ghost ship, heâs lost between two worlds
Heâll never returnâ¦.home
