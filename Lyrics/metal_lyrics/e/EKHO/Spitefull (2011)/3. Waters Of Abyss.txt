Sunlight blackened, eternal decay
Ruthless streams, take you away
Into the depths, of the unknown
In this wretched realm
Gods shall be dethroned
Infernal moonlight, never ceasing
Through tranquil night, time can be deceiving
Bound to lurk in the river of shades
Drowned in sorrow for all time remains

Drawn into the tempest of madness
Dales flooded with hate
Touched by the Moro's decaying caress
Thy life shall fade

Baptized in the river of fire
Somatic vulnerability Perished
True invincibility, cannot be acquired
Just try to subdue your fate

Sunlight blackened, eternal decay
Ruthless streams, take you away

Black shores of decadence
Slowly becoming overflown
Flowing through your veins is valiance
You're like a king reaching for his throne

Baptized in the river of fire
Somatic vulnerability Perished
Your demise is inevitable
Buried deep in the darkness of Erebus

Baptized in the river of fire
Somatic vulnerability Perished
True invincibility, cannot be acquired
Just try to subdue your fate
