For years I've held this burden, seeing you drift away
Like water running through fingertips
As my inner light dims

For Years I've held this burden, seeing you drift away
I was born into this flame child, raised by thorn
I'm floating between the worlds
Gateways to the void
Drowning in your eyes, like gallows
A prisoner to your spite
Decaying from your bane
Captivated by your sight, silenced with pain

You were my blade, my own retreat
You were the light, flowing through my veins
And when all ends, you leave me to freeze

I shall forever
I shall forever fall

Listen to the trees, enchanting with lore
Tales of the elders, of blood-red horizons and hordes
Oracles of days past, embrace with your enlightenment
Take me through the halls of time
And well' be one forevermore

For Years I've held this burden, seeing you drift away
I was born into this flame child, raised by thorn
I'm floating between the worlds
Gateways to the void
Drowning in your eyes, like gallows
A prisoner to your spite
Decaying from your bane
Captivated by your sight, silenced with pain

Now it's time, for a new dawn to come
The beginning of a journey, yet the end of
Now it's time, to stop the withdrawal
Face the battlefront, arise
Yet more is to come
