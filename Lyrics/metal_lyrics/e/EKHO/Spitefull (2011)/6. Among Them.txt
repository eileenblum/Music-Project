As diminishing shadow of sorrow and loath
Paralyzes all with enchanting flow
Descends upon the icy coasts
Darkness shall swallow the land

Towering mountains rise from ash

The sacred wrath of this forgotten domain
Its storming might seems arcane
Under the fist of their ghastly reign
Our oath blazing
Hidden light unveiled

The sacred wrath of this forgotten domain
Its storming might seems arcane
Under the fist of their ghastly reign
Our oath blazing
Hidden light unveiled

In the midst of departure
Night sky glimmers
Wisdom of the Charon
Enlightens our soul
An inevitable conclusion
Eventually you'll see
You are none but among them
Among the shadows

You are none but among them, among the shadows...

As Diminishing shadow of sorrow and loath
Paralyzes all with enchanting flow
Descends upon the icy coasts
Darkness shall swallow the land
