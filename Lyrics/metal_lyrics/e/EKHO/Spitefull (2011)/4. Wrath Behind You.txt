Into the star-born skies we gaze,
Bearers of lost vision
Cries of the wind howling in pain,
The eve of bliss comes to an end

While we lay in moss covered ground,
Arcane lights dance and flicker
In darksome lands afar from home,
The chants of war awake...

The scent of battle approaches,
Diluted with sorrow and woe
Soon to come is our fate,
Swimming across time our foes

Nocturnal beings, warriors of the night
We stand tall brethren, in the majesty of our might
Far in the lands where no man dwells
Deep into the dark woods slowly we fell

As the damp soil touches our feet,
Roaming towards the bleak sun, soon we'll meet
Into barren wastelands we shall ride,
Run into battle, our heads held up high
Not this dawn,no we shall not flee
Storming across the lands, you'll fall down to your knees

Trembling before the dark days to come
As time takes its toll
When we become our own hate
Death or victory are our only shelter

The scent of battle approaches,
Diluted with sorrow and woe
Soon to come is our fate,
Swimming across time our foes

Hungry desire, Lust for light
We fought hard, with full force and might
Lost in the streaming tide of Grief
Battered souls, we wont die in the heat

And when the sun goes down,
We descend to our own paths,
This dawn has past,
And it will never rise again

Hungry desire, Lust for light
We fought hard, with full force and might
Lost in the streaming tide of Grief
Battered souls, we wont die in the heat

And when the sun goes down,
We descend to our own paths,
This dawn has past,
And it will never rise again

Truth be told,
You are your own wrath,
The wrath, The wrath behind you.
