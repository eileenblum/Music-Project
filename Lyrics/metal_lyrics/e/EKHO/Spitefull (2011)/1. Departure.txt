I look into these vast skies
That hold the might of a thousand fires
Like Forefathers with their wisdom
Stars guide my path

While time's gates descend behind me
You are nowhere to be found
Left stripped, prey to the elements
With none but thy will
Your absence, an aura caressing me
Surrounding my way, decaying my path
Blind is my journey wherever I might go

These grounds soaked in the blood of our loss
And the forests are growing on years of wait
Covering our dark enchanting past
Waiting for the light

I look into these vast skies
That hold the might of a thousand fires
Like forefathers with your wisdom
Stars carry me on

Your absence, an aura caressing me
Surrounding my way, decaying my path
Blind is my journey, wherever I may go

As I fall from the treetops
Emerging in flames
Like a storm through the shadows
Defeated in vain
And when the time passes
For you shall see
After our great departure
Your presence was kept in me
