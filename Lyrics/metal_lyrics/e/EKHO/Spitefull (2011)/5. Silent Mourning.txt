Never seen light, fragments of hope shattered
This frozen wasteland, lost souls gather
Shrieking voices, echo in the wind
Piercing our heart, voices of the dead

From the empty, hollow darkness
Eyes watch without seeing
Comfort and warmth, long lost
As their loved ones stop being
Graves open, ready for arrival
They left no chance for survival
Even anger flowing in ones veins
Doesn't take away the pain

Black valleys filled with hatred and despair
Through the trees
Reflecting their lifeless stare
Terror slithers into all, coldly upon the land
Out of the soil, with its death-white hand

Never seen light, fragments of hope shattered
This frozen wasteland, lost souls gather
Shrieking voices, echo in the wind
Piercing our heart, voices of the dead
