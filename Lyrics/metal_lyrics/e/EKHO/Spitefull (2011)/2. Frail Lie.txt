You think you know when my time is right
Standing there with your shining might
No more than a frail lie
Now it's gone, give me a fight

Time and time again
Your pain leads the way
Nails pierce through my neck
Were a death serum, now it's wrecked

Halt your ever strong reign
Don't set shadow on the pain
You're no more than a frail lie
Now it's gone, give me a fight

Look at what you have become
Oh sweet saint, your role here's done
Corrosive lies, whispered bane
Now here's what you are, unanswered crave
For he whom has been raised to hate

Through hate he sees and to hate awakes
For he whom has been raised to hate
Through hate he sees and hate creates

Carrier of this burden
Burden of disguise
Corroded by nothing
Weaving your malice through time

When blades turn to rust
And pain turns to dust
Omens tell of light
But you're forever corrupt
After many lost endeavors
The gales are soon to rise
Aeons of lost times slip away
