Self-destruct Intelligence
Desperate evidence.
They are screaming in confusion
Screening poisoned evolution.
Crying at the void
Dying, ending, wiping out.
No suicide is no solution
Anti learning - a growing conclusion.
Help us, help us nonexistence
No one there to cast a shout.
I refuse to see the truth
Kill me, shoot me, wipe me out.
Learning leads to devastation
Mindless efforts combination.
All the books they tell us lies
No one here to win the price.
