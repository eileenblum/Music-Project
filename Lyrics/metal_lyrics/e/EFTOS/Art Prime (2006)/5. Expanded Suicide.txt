I can not see it suffer
I can not see it breathe
Staring at the Nothing
Emotionless disease
Death is silent
Death is clean
First my baby
And then me

Expanded Suicide
Total destruction
Cleaned infection
Ending the line
The void silenced
Her crime erased

Yeah, waves of depression
Suicide
Cause of non-existence
Pregnancy
Childbed depression

Not to be is general
Without solution
