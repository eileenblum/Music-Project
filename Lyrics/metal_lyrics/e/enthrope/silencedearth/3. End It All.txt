An empty stare fading through this shadowed realm
Sundown reflecting tomorrow's dead days

There's no more light ...for me to shine
There's no more light
There's no more light
And the shape of life ...vanished away

And the sickness is revealed
The journey ends to reach humanity
We watch the world's demise
Corroding the wish for life
Damnations to see
To end all life serene

I believe it wept, as the colossal waters fell upon
The drain eternal to gather us down

There's no more pain ...for us to mourn
There's no more pain
There's no more pain
Where we could drown again

Never betray me
As soon as you breath me
Never despair me
With your luciferian hearts

Forever to keep thee
To follow me blindly
Eternal to burn thee
As once as the ruins of Rome

There's no more pain ...for us to mourn
Where we could drown again

I shall be your temple for the dead
A shrine to drain stigmas dry

There's no more pain ...for us to mourn
Where we could drown again

There's no more light
And the shape of life ...vanished away

I shall be your temple for the dead
A shrine to drain stigmas dry

And the sickness is revealed...

And the sickness is revealed
The journey ends to reach humanity
We watch the world's demise
Corroding the wish for life
Damnations to see
To end all life serene

And the sickness is complete
The journey ends to reach humanity
I saw the worlds demise
Hexed the world in black
And with deaths blessed bane
I end it all again
