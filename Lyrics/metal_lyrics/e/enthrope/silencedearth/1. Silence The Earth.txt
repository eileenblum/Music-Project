The flesh reckoning the night
For the soul to devour the light
Of days yet to come forth
With silence so deep, so cold

Calculations for entropy
The sum of everything left behind

Everything... anything...
That once came to life

The mislead beasts of dawn
Hexes the wounds given by god
Storm those gathered under sulphur rain
And penetrate their late life strain

Calculations for entropy
The sum of everything left behind

Anything... anyone that breaths
The deep dead sleep

Calculations of entropy
The sum of everything left behind
A shade lament for the dying
And praise any forthcoming doom

Silence the earth
Begone the wish for the world
Hark! As they laugh at the gates of slumber
Silence the earth
Begone the wish for the world
Ripping the void
End the cycle of birth

Everything... anything...
That once came to life

Silence the earth
Begone the wish for the world
Hark! As they laugh at the gates of slumber
Silence the earth
Begone the wish for the world
Ripping the void
End the cycle of birth

Silence the earth
Hope is lost for the world
Silence the earth
Forever gone life on this earth
