Inside the collapsing mind there's no way out
Ripping through the maze of denial and fear
The corridor with black painted doors
All closed and shut but one to take you back

All those shapes and silhouettes
Bearers of the darkness upon
Finally we'll fade away

A new way to strife through this life
Entering the dominion binding all lies
These darkened eyes
To defy all other light
I shall see everything... see everything

Right behind your eyes
Salvation found inside the abyss
Trapped inside your denial
Weak is the light
So it dies inside your eyes

All those shapes and silhouettes
Bearers of the darkness upon
Finally we'll fade away

Right behind your eyes
Salvation found inside the abyss
Trapped inside your denial
Weak is the light
So it dies inside your eyes
