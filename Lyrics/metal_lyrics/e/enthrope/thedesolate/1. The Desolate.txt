Like a saint
Voices fade

This libertine feeds the melody
That our silence prevails
Last one to uphold
This stagnant void

...in peace

Like Abel beneath Cain
The lion upon its prey
Just another violent way
Rest assure, man will fall
Beneath oblivions floor
But even the lions roar
Will die beneath oblivions core

Disappear, the Desolate
This is the way
It all has to go
Can I find the strain?
For me to leave this void

...in peace
