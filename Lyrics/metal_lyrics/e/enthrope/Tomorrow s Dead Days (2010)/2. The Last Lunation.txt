Life inside delusion
Facades that will fall
Million hours spent
Blindfolded and torn

Cold staring statues
Garden of insanity
A smother precedes
The Eden's demise

Above us all
The black clouds gather
The burning rain falls down

Encircled by ruins of
Highest form of existence
Decadent souls collide
Ache in nothingness

The last lunation
Ignorance gone too far
Soon we will spin
Like neutron stars

Above us all
The black clouds gather
The burning rain falls down
