Behind the eyes of deceit
Turmoil in the synaptic code
Loss of innocence from sin
Cure for the dead sun within

Rapture burns the void
For suffering hides in silence
The obsolete sign of the cross
Destroys the ethereal shape of hope

A monarch for the mechanical god
The stir of echoes climb the prisoners wall
Circularity of the serpent sign
Hiding the dead sun fragment below

Obsolete is the voice of wonder
Empire for the fallen to rise
To praise the dead sun fragment
We are here for the pain

And darkness breaths the air
As a black cancer to reclaim
With a dead sun fragment within
Disappear without the aeons redeem
