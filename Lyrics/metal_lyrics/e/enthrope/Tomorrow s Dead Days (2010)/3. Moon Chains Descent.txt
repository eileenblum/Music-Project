Air glow turns into fire
Above the sleeping world
Falls down ruin beyond the sun
Time has come for defeat
Monuments collapse, high-rises cave-in
The end is at hand
As foreseen

From the void
Befalls the wrath
The Universe has sent
Burning down
Tearing apart
Moon chains descent

Wiping of the plague on earth
The virulent disease
Fiery rain enlightens the gloom
Souls immersed in emptiness

Decay within, increasing hate
Finally fades, on disarray
In endlessness, soar the remains
Unfolds a dark cloud of plague

Squashed inside concrete tombs
In vain implore redemption

From the void
Befalls the wrath
The Universe has sent
Burning down
Tearing apart
Moon chains descent
