Illuminate spheres in the dark
This visionary hope will die soon
Without the guiding light
Silver spears breaking through

Sealed off
The eyes of gods
Shutdown daylight
The white disease
Drained the oceans
Painted our horizon bleak

Beyond the heavens, is someone watching?
Our journey, hopeless and obscure
Will they help us rise
From this chaos and decline?

Under veils of steam
Dead fall in the granite yards
Withers breath
Once eternal light turns blue

Shallow figures twisted
Beyond the lunacy

Forlorn screams

A dead reality
We are the enemy within
