Five point shaped sign, symmetry of disgust
Stagnant malediction cast spirits away
Darken the golden sun, I am the new light
Illumination paradox

Falling deeper down, I feel the dusk on me
The moon and stars they hide their face from me
Marked with this sign upon my burning skin
I am the libertine

And they saw me fall as the morning star
Hiding the moon as morning light

I am who I am, I am who he made
To wander in the shade
To be blamed by the sins you make
All for your place in heaven to gain

I bring you the light, for shadows you desire
Lust spawn paths revealed, I guide you through the fire
You need me as much you need sin within
You are the libertine

And they saw me fall as the morning star
Hiding the moon as morning light

I am who I am, I am who he made
To wander in the shade
To be blamed by the sins you make
All for your place in heaven to gain

With the image of man, black eyed and spawned with flies
I am the new light and you are in the shade

With earth in my mouth I'll embrace the world
Generations wait for a saint
I'll still be under the sun after you are long since gone
With a hunger of freedom I'll strife in this barren land

I bring you light, for shadows you desire
This is the paradox
You don't want to fall through the fire
Still you call me when sin burns within

Generations fail
Never to rise again
They're all saved to leave me all the blame
