Instinct driven diseased
Our failed creations
Breeding among the pure
Defiling our domain

As your human disguise
Wears out and fades
Separation takes place
An extinction awaits

The ill elements concealed
Will soon be revealed
We pardon you with demise
Purge our aura, burn the filth alive

Sui generis specie
Callous defunct souls
Cleansed into oblivion
The planet we'll purify

Sickness caused sickness
Non compos mentis fiends
Entrust yourselves to us
In the stake you'll be redeemed
