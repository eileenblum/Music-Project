Remnants of a dead soul
Imprisoned in mine
Synodic periods spent
Possessed inside

Screams of a ghoul
Siren calls to glide
Out of this faint woe
To the immoral side

Immersed in nothingness
There's no morning light
In this realm I have built
In universe mute and blind

Stars of Nhagrad
Shine blue forevermore
Stars of Nhagrad

Remains of purity
Torn apart and left behind
A new era will rise
At rebirth, in demise

Dispersed in emptiness
This unlit eternal night
In the realm I have built
A universe mute and blind

I am the ghost in your tales
I am the demon in your head
I am the virus of new world
A disease you can't amend
Crucified with rusty nails
Abused with words unsaid
In your reality, absent
