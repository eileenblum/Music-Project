It has felt like a thousand days and nights
Timelessness has blurred my senses
Chaotic beauty circling above my head
A halo of entities long since gone.

Silence and its heavy burden
Collapsing the gateways I try to reach.
And the wonder I have of my keep.
Where may this dying heart now sleep

Trapped within
Torn apart
Losing inner silence (falling down)
Linger through the sunken sun, as all else fails
Reaching out for sanity

An aeon pointing the way
Shown as a star above the shadowed dawn
Suddenly, the horizon is gone
I pass the shadows and move on...

A glimpse of a dawn
Foreboding of horrors coming forth
Ethereal were those vivid vistas
Marked by clandestines in darkness held

This is the time of the dead
Cracking the walls keeping me safe
Chaotic beauty circling above my head
Rips me away

Trapped within
Tearing apart
Losing inner silence (falling down)
Linger through the sunken sun, as all else fails
Reaching out for sanity
