Oh the frozen earth
Torn asunder by aeons dark
Suffocating, smiling, dying!!
The swords of havoc have been risen

Fragments of puzzles
Bit by bit gathered a vivid form
Deep down dwelling forlorn
A master rising above the stars

Human form illumination
Keeping the gates wide open
For those universal souls
They are what I've become

The bringer of havoc
Darkness descent
A masterpiece for the earth
Like a solar wind I sweep the world

And with the end of dawn
The betrayal of man
Becomes my part

THE BRINGER OF HAVOC!
