Mens indigne nega
Ante oculus non spectat
Superstitio,
Timore valet

Spero desperatio prosequi
Laetitia obscuret et sopit
Omnis Crudele

Under a mysterious sky
I see the beauty of the landscape
The white snow
The endless wasteland of the true mysterium
The unimportant existence of mankind
Is in the cosmic order of being

Master, free me
From my painful journey
To my subconscious out of darkness
Where blindness is enlightenment
Follow the path of darkness
Where the wolves gather
Enter the woods of eternity
And end my journey

On a cold winter's morning
