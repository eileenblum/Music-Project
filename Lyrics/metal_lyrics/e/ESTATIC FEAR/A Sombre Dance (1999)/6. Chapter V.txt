Many a weary night endured
Since the utter charm of joy has pured
My unquiet dreams, my misery
How sweat if I could share with thee
Unable to endure it's smile
Which kindly eased my sombre veil
I frightened turned my burdened head
And hid in slumbers shade instead

But lifted from my mournful rest
Was I by thee nocturnal guest
When though did vow to suffocate
My tranquil dreams in thrones bed
You spoke to me with loathed glow
And thus have though not kept thy vow
For when thy shadow sprang on me
I closed my eyes in ecstasy
