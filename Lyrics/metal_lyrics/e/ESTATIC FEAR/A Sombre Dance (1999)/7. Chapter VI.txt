Unveil yours eyes, see the special moon gone
Leaving not a single ray of joy to rest upon
Feast on those that crave thy kiss with a ghastly wail
Behold them cry as their faces innocence grows pale
Tempt them into approaching your obscure neglect
Until on your detesting laugh their hopes get wrecked
Praise this rage and the only eyes will see
Thy love abandoned mirrors image, thy only company
