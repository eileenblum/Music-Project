I lay down
I make no sound
I'll lose my soul
As I turn to stone

There's no way to fall
To the sweetest love again
I won't stay for your love
'Cause you're not for me

I break down
When you're not around
I waste my soul
For you to hold

I lay myself to rest
I turn to stone
Where could I go from here
I fade myself away
Out of the pain
But the hurt still remains the same
