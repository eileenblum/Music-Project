You raped me with your lies
It hurt me deep inside
Some might say that I'm not the fortunate one
You love to break me down
But I'll stay to hear you out
Some might say that I'm the fallen one

Lead me out from the dark and kill my pain

Bring it up
Tear me down
May the world go around n' around
At the end of desire
Your world falls down and dies

How could you let me down
And blame me for what you've done
After all I think that you're the fallen one

Fleeting touch in the dark caused by pain
Free me now... and crawl out of my soul
