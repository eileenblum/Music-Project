Reality bites
Taking all your alibies
And you're still waiting for the new dawn
Within your denial
You're keeping all the memories inside
Still waiting for the new fall

Lake of tears rebuild your soul
So now it's time to let go

We're born to lose but we live to win
Thru the flames of life
It's the beginning, not the end of our time

We live and we die
So throw out all your fears
You hide inside and keep waiting for the new dawn
Open your eyes
All you had is still there outside
It's still waiting for you to come

From the stream we arise
To the ocean we'll fall
My design for life is to be strong
'Till the end of time
