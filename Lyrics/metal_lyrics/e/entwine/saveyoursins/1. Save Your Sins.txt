Restrain your life to tame your sins,
Pretending eyes behind your grin,
Ethereal silence of the end,
You fake your smile for your defense.

For the lives we have to swallow,
Makes it hard to be your friend,
I try not to follow, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm in pain, but I don't care,
And it breaks your will to burn,
Do you think to understand,
We're bold as we still turn.

Whoa,
I think, that I don't care,
Whoa,
I think, that I don't care.

So bite your tongue to save your sins,
The lack of smile for you're the end.

For the lives we have to swallow,
Makes it hard to be your friend,
I try not to follow, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm in pain, but I don't care,
And it breaks your will to burn,
Do you think to understand,
We're bold as we still turn.
I'm in pain, but I don't care,
And it breaks your will to burn,

FÏck off!
Youâre nothing but a fickle fucker.
Hah!

[Solo]

I'm in pain, but I don't care,
And it breaks your will to burn,
Do you think to understand,
We're bold as we still turn

I'm in pain, but I don't care (don't care)
Do you think to understand,
We're bold as we still turn
