I feel the silence of death, but I just can't hear the sound.
Into the arms of my faith and my heart's beating rate is slowing down.
It's like awakening sign with a great compromise
To fake it anyhow or anyway.

Before we end up crying... are we choosing to fade away
Before we end up dying..

Burned inside out in these flames, I don't believe that we're done
Before you believe those innocent, lies of very end,
Just tie your eyes and listen.
Drowned but never false, I am standing tall
To wake you up and see what is wrong.

Before we end up crying... are we choosing to fade away
Before we end up dying.. stand up to the open place.
