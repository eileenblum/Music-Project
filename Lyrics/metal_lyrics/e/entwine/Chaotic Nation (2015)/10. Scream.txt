I'm not far, less than a minute away
From the time I'll leave it all behind. No fear, no pain.
Drifting alone in silence, I'm drifting away from you...
This time, I'll leave you behind and deep inside..

I hear the scream... deep down inside I hear
I need to scream... deep down inside I feel
I need to scream...

Gotta run, I've got no time to waste.
For the life in a dying days of the lost embrace
Drifting away from silence, not a single thought of denial
It's time, it's time for the last goodbyes.

And I hear the scream... deep down inside I hear
I need to scream... deep down inside I feel
I need to scream...

Gotta run for my life, ain't got no time to waste,
Gotta leave you behind to get out of the dying days
And I scream... I need to scream...
I feel the light is dying out
And every single bridge will crash and burn.
I know the time is running out
There's not a single word that is unheard.
There's not a single word that is unheard
And every single bridge will crash and burn.
There's not a single word that is unheard
And every single bridge will crash and burn.
