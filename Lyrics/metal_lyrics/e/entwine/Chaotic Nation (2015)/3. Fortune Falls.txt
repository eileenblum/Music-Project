Forty hits to get me high, only one way to survive
What a face delight to make me stronger.
Too supreme to bring it down, hold my breath or scream it out
At the end of this we'll face the pouring rain.
Fire in my fingertips, I won't sleep until I'm done,
I believe I'm done with craving

Hold me down away from defeat
Fame is gone, the fortune falls.

We need to cleans our minds (slowly fading out within)
The poison is keeping us blind (in denial of everything)
We need to free our minds to justify what we've become

Forty hits within denial, forty ways to say goodbye
At the end of days we'll face the pouring rain
Higher I fall into denial
How am I supposed to live like this?

Hear the call, the voice in beneath,
Fame is gone, the fortune falls.

We need to cleans our minds (slowly fading out within)
The poison is keeping us blind (in denial of everything)
Lead me out and lay me down away from the edge of the fall

Slowly... ending... the fame is gone, the fortune falls.

We need to cleans our minds (slowly fading out within)
The poison is keeping us blind (in denial of everything)
Lead me out and lay me down away from the edge of the fall

Slowly ending waste of time, forty hits within denial
The rain has come to break a dawn.
