The heat of the night, in need of praise and glory
Just wave to the crowd, this is your final twisted show
And try to be real in a plastic world of fear and laughter
You're just another headline for the evening news

Tonight like a movie star
Crying for a pill
The cure for the broken heart
Love to fulfill
To wish upon the stars
Surrender to heal
Making a new start
It's time to believe in your soul

The fear of the light, feeds another midnight story
Faced on the ground you crawl, before the final call
It's time to reveal the drastic world of chain reactions
For another bloodline wasted on the floor

Tonight like a movie star
Crying for a pill
The cure for the broken heart
Love to fulfill
To wish upon the stars
Surrender to heal
Making a new start
It's time to believe in your soul

Tonight like a star without a role
Wasted on the floor in a plastic world
The shining star is about to fall

Tonight like a movie star
Crying for a pill
The cure for the broken heart
Love to fulfill
To wish upon the stars
Surrender to heal
Making a new start
It's time to believe in your soul
It's time to believe in your soul
It's time to believe
