Breakdown on a sweet surrender. All eyes, on a great pretendere.
Slaves write songs to prove they're right
Raise your hands before they blast another crime.
So it goes, we're just trying to survive
And they can go as they please.

Breakdown... on a sweet surrender.
All eyes unfold as we arise again.
No lies to feed, no crimes to hide...
No drifting away from the truth, we're dynamite.

Oh no, we ain't here to stay, no place to run or hideaway.
When the demon's driving two sides, always on the run
Feel free to see what we've become
The torment of staying all alone and to survive
This is the final turn, the final crime.

Breakdown... on a sweet surrender.
All eyes unfold as we arise again.
No lies to feed, no crimes to hide... as we arise.

It's time to arise, arise from the dead,
Only lies that they're trying to provide.
It's time ... to arise, arise from the dead
And to fight for the future delight
As we arise.
