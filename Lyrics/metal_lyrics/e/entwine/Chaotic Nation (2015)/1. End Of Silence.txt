Ain't that a bitch to figure out
The whole system falls apart
And the only one who goes 
down down down is you

You put your life on those who say
"We are here to save the day"
Break out now and see the light in silence

We're off to default, framed in your life
Breaking our souls and the state of mind
I want to break your heart tonight
We'll meet at the End of Silence

Break through and I will testify
The whole world is in denial
And the only one who goes 
down down down is you

You put your trust in those who say
"We are here to save the day"
Wake up now you see the light in silence

We're off to default, framed in your life
Breaking our souls and the state of mind
I want to break your heart tonight
We'll meet at the End of Silence

We're off to default, framed in your life
Breaking our souls and the state of mind
I want to break your heart tonight
We'll meet at the End of Silence

We're off to default
Breaking our souls
I want to break your heart tonight
We'll meet at the End of Silence
