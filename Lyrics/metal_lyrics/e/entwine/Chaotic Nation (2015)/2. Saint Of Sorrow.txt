I felt the darkness in me
(was it greater than light it's for me to decide)
After all, I wanted to face my fears
(to find myself in me for no more bitterness to breed)

Sometimes I felt, in spite of all,
To blow my brains to the wall

No! No! No more hollow, no more sweet dreams to swallow.
No! No! No more sorrow.
There is an open door, so what you waiting for?

Now I feel the brightness in me
(it is shining so black there is no forth and back)
I fought to feel myself humane
(I had to face my demons to justify who I am)

I do not miss that phase at all
When I was near to blow my brains to the wall

No! No! No more hollow, no more sweet dreams to swallow.
No! No! I'm not the saint of sorrow.
Black lights, the way to the door, so what you waiting for?
No! No! No more hollow, no more sweet dreams to swallow.
No! No! I'm not the saint of sorrow.
Black lights, the way to the door, so what the hell you're waiting for??
