Falling into the eye of disaster
We're delayed in a time that is long gone
In the end of the joy, we go faster
Before the call, I'll try to keep it...

Adrenalized, adrenalized...
Don't keep me waiting for the fall.
Adrenalize, adrenalize.
Adrenalize, adrenalize...
Don't keep me waiting for the fall.
Adrenalized... we'll keep it.

Make it stop, there's no time to go faster
In the end, there's no time to rise and fall.
Moving slow, we're watching the disaster
Before the storm, I'm trying to keep it...

I'm a monster and I'm a failure
But I am finding my way out of this mess.

Well it's time to arise or fuck it up and die.
