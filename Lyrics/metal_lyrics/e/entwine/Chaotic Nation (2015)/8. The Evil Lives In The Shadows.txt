I'm drowning in this hate and I feel my life is falling down.
I know I was a fool when I believed all those wicked lies.
You created the Frankenstein, you created the Frankenstein.

Only wicked things I devour, all is getting twisted and evil again.
Only wicked things I devour, all is getting twisted and evil again.
The evil lives.. in the shadows.
Insanity... it follows.

I have to keep on trying, there is not other way.
I think I've gone insane and once again there's hell within.
I just want to live my life, I just wanna leave it all behind.
