Now that I have lost my ways
For that I'm breaking down
And I hide from the saints
Hear me out, the story goes...

I believe I've testified, I fill my life with fear
In beneath I lost my mind and I'll make it disappear
Now that I have lot my ways and I start to dig a hole
No money of mine can make a burial bribe for the ancient keeper of souls.

I'm facing of the fact that I'm alone, to purify myself I move along
I've gotta find myself an act that causes me a heart attack
And I'm gonna find my way... out of this God damn race.

I find it hard to tell if I am lost within these years
Deep inside I scream for answers, buried in these fears
Now that I have lost my grave and I start to dig a hole
No money of mine can make a burial bribe for the ancient keeper of souls.
