There's no time for you baby
No time to realize
Our life will be wasted
You ruin it with all your lies
Would you die for me baby
'Cos I'm dying all the time
I'm tired of this faking

This time I'm gonna be strong
This time I've gotta move on
You've laughed at me for the last time
No more of these bitter lies

You're in love with yourself, baby
Is it love we sacrifice?

This time I'm gonna be strong
This time I've gotta move on
You've laughed at me for the last time
No more of these bitter lies

No more lies
From now until the end of time
