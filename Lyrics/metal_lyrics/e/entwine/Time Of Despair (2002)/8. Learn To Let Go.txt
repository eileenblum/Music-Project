In this life I'm searching for the reasons
How to learn to realize things we feel inside
Oh, why I have these strange emotions
And the answers that I've found
They're not enough for me

It's time we're reaching out for more
It's time we're reaching out for love
Well it's time to realize what are we for
'Cos it's time to realize what are we for

And now I've gathered all the answers
Now I've learnt to realize
Learnt to let go
Arise, so you can feel it in ou
My search has come to an end
Or has it just begun?

It's time we're reaching out for more
It's time we're reaching out for love
Well it's time to realize what are we for
'Cos it's time to realize what are we for
