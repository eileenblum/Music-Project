I'll lead you down to the ocean
I'll show you all my darkest deeds

I feel like losing my emotions
When we fall into the stream

We will drown, we will drown
Into this love
You may decide

I'm hanging on to these emotions

There ain't no cure for love

I think I'm losing my devotions

So I pour my tears into your heart

We will drown, we will drown
Into this love
We may decide

We will drown in this love
Eternally...
