Eternal is the pain that you gave me
Lonely roses wither and die

These tears of mine stain your veil
I'm forced to hide and fade away
So soon the time will come
Take my life and bring me to the ground

In this time of despair
When all that you love is dead
It's my desireless game to be alive

It's a heart of stone that beats inside
I'm forced to climb over the walls
Stillness falls upon this endless night

In this time of despair
When all that you love is dead
It's my desireless game to be alive
I'm tryin' to get well
But I'm just cryin' for the end
It's my desireless way to be alive

Eternal is the pain that you gave me
Lonely roses wither and die

In this time of despair
When all that you love is dead
It's my desireless game to be alive
I'm tryin' to get well
And no more cryin' for the end
A desireless way to be alive
