[Bonus track]

You said it all
When you didn't say a word
Loving thoughts
You think I tried to hurt
So complete
Is how we used to be
Can't you see
That all we need is time.....
To know the reason why

Just hold me now
Tonight
Oh, my love
It's raining out
Tonight
Oh, my love

When the rain is gone
I look deep into your eyes
We make love
And all we have is time
I know we'll make it right

So hold me now
Tonight
Oh, my love
It's raining out
Tonight
Oh, my love
Just hold me by your side
Oh, my love
It's raining out
Tonight
Oh, my love
it's raining deep inside

Tonight
Oh, my love
It's raining out
Tonight
Oh, my love
Cause we can make it right
Oh, my love
It's raining out tonight
Oh, my love
It hurts deep inside
