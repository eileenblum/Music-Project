I'm not here to break you
I am here to save your soul
I'm not here to hurt you
I don't want you to lose control

I am the shape of your life
I am the seed of your mind

I'll be your dream
I'll be your star
Can't you see that I'm the one
I'll be your hate
I'll be your love
Don't you know that I'm the one

I'm not here to use you
I am here to tame your soul
I'm not here to blame you
I am here to play your role

I am the shape of your life
I am an illusion of your mind

I'll be your dream
I'll be your star
Can't you see that I'm the one
I'll be your hate
I'll be your love
Don't you know that I'm the one

I'll be your dream
I'll be your star
Can't you see that I'm the one
I'll be your hate
I'll be your love
Can't you see I'm falling apart
