[Bonus track]

[KISS Cover]

I read your mind like an open book
You lost the fire in your eyes
You turn to me with a different look
And then it's raining, looks like it's raining

Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling

Something is wrong as I hold you near
Somebody else holds your heart, yeah
You look at me with your eyes in tears
And then it's raining, feels like it's raining

Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
I saw you cry

And now it's raining
Looks like it's raining
And now it's raining, feels like it's raining

Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling
(These tears they keep on falling down on me)
