I have to lay it down
Before the sky falls down on me
Feels like the way goes down
My forgotten guilt will rise again
No use to live this life
With all these fears inside my heart
I need a place to hide
'Cos my forgotten guilt will rise again
I will try to get out of this pain
So I cry
That's the way to release the pain out of my head
It's hard to smile when I'm down
But I'll do the best I can
I will try to get out of this pain
