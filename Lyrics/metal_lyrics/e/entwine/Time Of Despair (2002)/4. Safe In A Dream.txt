On the edge of life
After all these days are gone
The endless haze will rise

I close my eyes
I'm safe from all harm
I'm safe in a dream
I want you to stay
I want you to be there for me
'Cos I need your love
I need your touch
I long for your embrace

On the edge of time
All the scenes are falling behind
It seems that alls is lost

I close my eyes
I'm safe from all harm
I'm safe in a dream
I want you to stay
I want you to be there for me
'Cos I need your love
I need your touch
I long for your embrace
