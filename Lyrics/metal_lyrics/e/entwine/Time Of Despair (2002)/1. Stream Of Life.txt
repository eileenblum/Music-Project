In the state of your mind burning low
And the fear you hide seems to grow
The shade of your lies makes you blind
And you live your life with no desire

It's in your head it's in your eyes
It's in your dreams, it's in disguise
So you should try to free your mind
Then you'll find the stream of life

Well it's easy to drown in this life
Now's the time for you to realize
With the burden inside you'll get lost
Here's the reason for you to wake up

It's in your head it's in your eyes
It's in your dreams, it's in disguise
So you should try to free your mind
Then you'll find the stream of life

Let it flow
