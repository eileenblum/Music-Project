No one to follow
Nobody to care
I'll leave tomorrow
From my dying bed

I need you to hear my call
Silent weep
Dying moan

Change me
And fill the end with life
To catch we when I fall
Fill the end
Hear me out

I still believe
There a sing on the road
Father's sins are framed in mine
Draining me, from the life I used to hold
I live still, in a perfect lie to survive

I used to follow
I used to care
Lived for tomorrow
Now the focus is not there

I need you to hear my call
Silent weep
Dying moan

Change me
Fill the end
Hear me out

I still believe
There's a sign on the road
Father's sins are framed in mine
Draining me, from the life I used to hold
I lie still, in a perfect lie to survive

And fill the end with life,
To catch me when I fall
And fill the end with life,
To catch me when I fall (fall)

[Solo]
Fill the end
Hear me out

I still believe
There a sing on the road
Father's sins are framed in mine
Draining me, from the life I used to hold
I live still, in a perfect lie to survive

There a sing on the road
Father's sins are framed in mine
Draining me, from the life I used to hold
I live still, in a perfect lie to survive
