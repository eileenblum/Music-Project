Well, I need time for myself
Before I'm what I despise
And I won't pretend, that everything is right

I just want to be sure, what I want
What I live for in this life
I'll be free, at the time
Before the end of dawn

I don't need you, for trouble in my life
'Cause I need you, strong and bright
I don't need you, for trouble in my life
'Cause I need you, to drown in me for awhile

For as long as I try to define
What I live for in this life
I declare off the right
To know where I belong

I don't need you, for trouble in my life
'Cause I need you, strong and bright
I don't need you, for trouble in my life
'Cause I need you, to drown in me for awhile

[Solo]

I don't need you, for trouble in my life
'Cause I need you (just for awhile), strong and bright
I so need you (just for awhile), for trouble in my life (just for awhile)
'Cause I need you, to drown in me for awhile

Just for awhile, for awhile
