Waking up in these confines
In my thoughts, I got my ways to hide it all
Shadows rise and shadows fall
Deep inside I hear them call
I believe I'm done before I'm even gone

My divine is sleeping pills and my delusions

Strangers we are
And still the same as we'd be in love
She'll bring the morning light
And pull the curtains wide
Invites the burning sun

Waking up to realize
Standing up to see the life beyond the war
If I'm blinded to go right
In the end I'm crucified
I believe, I'm done, before I'm even gone

My divine is sleeping pills and my delusions

Strangers we are
But, still the same as we'd be in love
In the lunar light
She'll pull the curtains tight
And stands beside me

Strangers we are
And still the same as we'd be in love
She'll bring the morning light
And pull the curtains wide
Invites the burning sun

[Solo]

Strangers we are
But, still the same as we'd be in love
In the lunar light
She'll pull the curtains tight
And stands beside me

Strangers we are
And still the same as we'd be in love
She'll bring the morning light
And pull the curtains wide
Invites the burning sun
