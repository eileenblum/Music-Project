Throw your lines all over the ceiling
Tie yourself to the floor
A reason why...
Over floating tears of mine
All becomes alive
It all becomes alive

Sins and my saviours
They're trying to twist their arms around my head
Fiends have grown my faults and failures
And I feel that I will drown, on and on
Iâll drown, on and on

I might have been dead
But, I don't know
What's the reason for this all?
I've become, what I am right now, you know?
In my time of dying, whole saddening life
Becomes alive, it's all a lie

Sins and my saviours
They're trying to twist their arms around my head
Fiends have grown my faults and failures
And I feel that I will drown

(Oh, I'mâ¦ denial)
Oh, I'm lost in
Oh, I'm lost in
Oh, I'm lost in my denial

Oh, I'm lost in
Oh, I'm lost in
Oh, I'm lost in my denial

Oh, I'm waiting for the call

(â¦ waiting for the call
Iâll chaise where demons are
Way high)
