Open up to me
And soon our worlds become one
Spread your wings to me
In time we end up high

Better hide from myself, I wanna die
I believe that it was wrong
To fall into desire,
So, we must crawl
Crawl away from the light
We'll go in through the fire

You spread your wings to me
And now the world is all wrong
Pleasures smile has turn to laughter
Leaving me to scream

Better hide from myself, I wanna die
I believe that it was wrong
To fall into desire,
So, we must crawl
Crawl away from the light

Better hide from myself, I wanna die
I believe that it was wrong, wrong

[Solo]

Better hide from myself, I wanna die
I believe that it was wrong
To fall into desire,
So, we must crawl
Crawl away from the light

Better hide from myself, I wanna die
I believe that it was wrong
To fall into desire,
So, we must crawl
Crawl away from the light
We'll go in through the fire
