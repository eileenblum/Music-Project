I feel my soul is burning
Filled with sorrow
A thousand lies are killing me
I don't need your sympathy
The scars inside me
Will guide my way out of this (of this)

Surrounded by the fools
Cheating and lying
Their smiles are filled with greed
I'm trying to find a way to make a solution
I know something must be done

In my hopes and dreams
I keep on going, down this road called life
I believe in me
I'm not afraid to die for my cause

Drowned in the sea of fire
Blessed with betrayal
I think I've fallen again
I don't have any answers
To my questions
I will die defending my soul

In my hopes and dreams
I keep on going, down this road called life
I believe in me
I'm not afraid to die for my cause

In my hopes in my dreams
I keep going down this road
I believe in me
I'm not afraid to die for my cause

The pain in my eyes, will tell you more
Than a thousand empty words
I have to follow my heart
