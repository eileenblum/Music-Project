Today I woke up screaming
I can't believe it's true
Not much left for crying
For this childish fool

I drift away from my pain
Seventh frikinâ time
Mind in my delusion
Iâll believe, I'm dry to cry

I'm running my delusions
As far as I can take
Agony is falling
But, insanity's delayed

I crucify my social life
I'm making it for real
Purify my ecstasy
Can't believe it's truly me
(Can't believe it's truly me)

Caught up and drained,
In the eye of the storm
I'll fade away with the anger I hold
My dreams are denied
I can't find a place where I belong

I'm lying to myself
And it's weakening my sight
Open up my troubles wide
But, the feeling is not right

I'll get away from my pain
By talking to myself
Waiting for my fears to break
I have nothing more to share

Caught up and drained,
In the eye of the storm
I'll fade away with the anger I hold
My dreams are denied
I can't find a place where I belong

Go!

[Solo]
