Just a wicked lie
Would you please step aside
Hide your face and try to cry
I believe that your time has come

Cry your silent tears on the side of the road
There's so many things that you cannot define
You realizeâ¦
To say goodbye, to say goodbye

It's a tricky world when you steep outside
You can't find the reason to rise and shine
Cannot even see that your time will come
You're reaching out, but you're staying alone
Not even listening the things,
That I've told you twice
I don't know whyâ¦

Faith in me is gone
You're chasing dreams of no return
Integrity my love
Don't pray for life that has been burned
That future is cruised
Say goodbyeâ¦

Faith in me is gone
You're chasing dreams of no return
Integrity my love
Don't pray for life that has been burned
Say goodbye

Say goodbye (say goodbye)
Say goodbye (say goodbye)
Faith in me is gone (say goodbye)
Don't pray for life that has been burned
That future is cruised (say goodbye)
I donât think its right besides (say goodbye)
I donât need that door inside my home
That future is cruised (say goodbye)
Cause all I need itâs you and I (say goodbye)
I don't know whyâ¦
