How much can we bare
These systematic fools
Our life depends on
Decisions of someone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, I can't take this anymore
I won't fake that, I'm your whore

Stand up and please stop whining
We can't go on
Brainwashed and dead by silence
The time has come

It's time to rebel
To stand and not to fall
Create your defense
Make decisions on your own

Ah-ah, ah-ah, I can't take this anymore
I won't fake, that I'm your whore

Stand up and please stop whining
We can't go on
Brainwashed and dead by silence
The time has come

Stand up,
Stand up,
Stand up and please stop whining [2x]

Stand up and please stop whining
We can't go on
Brainwashed and dead by silence
The time has come, come, comeâ¦
