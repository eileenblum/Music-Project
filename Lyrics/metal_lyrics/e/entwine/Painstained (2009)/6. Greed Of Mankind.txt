They say, every day is a good day
But we don't see what lies behind
Do we even know, where we are now?
Nothing is what it seems to be

Greed of mankind is taking over this
World of cruelty

We're crucified by the constant lies
Greed on mankind's taking over this
World of cruelty
We're crucified by the constant lies
No one's innocent, we've blend
For the sake of nothing

They say, the world is a great place
'Cos we are too blind to see
This all is based on deception
Soon to be killed by man

Greed of mankind is taking over this
World of cruelty

We're crucified by the constant lies
Greed on mankind's taking over this
World of cruelty
We're crucified by the constant lies
No one's innocent, we've blend
For the sake of nothing
For the sake of nothing
There comes the law!
For the sake of nothing

[Solo]

We're crucified by the constant lies
Greed on mankind's taking over this
World of cruelty
We're crucified by the constant lies
No one's innocent, we've blend
For the sake of nothing
For the sake of nothing
There comes the law!
For the sake of nothing
