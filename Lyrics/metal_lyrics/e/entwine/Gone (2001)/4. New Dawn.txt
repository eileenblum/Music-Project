[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - TAURIAINEN]

You said that you should be gone
Out of this place you don't belong
You said you might find a reason
Why we are so unforgiving

You said you'll try to make a new dawn
I know how hard it is to let go
Maybe we find the reason why we lie
Tonight's the night we...

Cry...all for love
You make me
Cry...all for love
You release me
Cry...all for love
You make me
Cry...all for love

You said that you need to be loved
So, I try to make a new dawn
And we will find the reason why we lie
Tonight's the night we...

Cry...all for love
You make me
Cry...all for love
You release me
Cry...all for love
You make me
Cry...all for love
You release me

Cry...all for love
You make me
Cry...all for love
You release me
Cry...all for love
You make me
Cry...all for love
You release me
