[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - TAURIAINEN - KIPPO]

You used my heart
So, you killed me again
Because of you
I'm crawling back to start

Wicked as you are
I think you could do it again
Don't you know you hurt me
With your lies

Don't hurt me with your lies

I thought that you could be
The one for me
The shining star in the sky
And the lunar light

The burden of your lies
It descends on me
Now I waste my time
Without your love

I can't help anymore

These tears they keep on falling down on me
These tears they keep on falling down on me
These tears they keep on falling down on me
These tears they won't be gone with autumn leaves

How can I fly when I fall
I'm losing my ground because of you

I can't help anymore

These tears they keep on falling down on me
These tears they keep on falling down on me
These tears they keep on falling down on me
These tears they won't be gone with autumn leaves
