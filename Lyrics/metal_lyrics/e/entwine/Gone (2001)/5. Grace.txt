[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - WILLMAN]

Her grace, her love I adore
For her I do no wrong
Her wings I thought I saw
She's so strong

With you forever let me stay
I won't break your heart don't be afraid

The two of us in my dream
You're my star
This place we'll never leave
We're in love

With you forever let me stay
I won't break your heart don't be afraid
With you forever let me stay
I won't break your heart don't be afraid
