[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - TAURIAINEN]

Hear this whisper silently turn into a moan
The eye of the storm breaks the silence
Soon we'll be gone
We all shall burn
Yeah, we'll burn

Hear this sound of relief
Coming out like the rain
Yeah, the blood of your soul
It'll wash away your pain

And we lie to believe what we hide
And we cry to release it anyhow

You know there is sorrow
Inside your heart and it needs to break out
If you lead it'll follow
Wherever you try to lay down

You cover all your fears
That create your pain
Fiends they'll tease you
Until you break

And we lie to believe what we hide
And we cry to release it anyhow

You know there is sorrow
Inside your heart and it needs to break out
If you lead it'll follow
Wherever you try to lay down

You know there is sorrow
Inside your heart and it needs to break out
If you lead it'll follow
Wherever you try to lay down...
