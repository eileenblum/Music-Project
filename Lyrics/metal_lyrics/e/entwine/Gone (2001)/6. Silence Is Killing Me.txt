[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - TAURIAINEN]

As I open my eyes for the new dawn
I realize how lost we are
Today's the day when we open the new door
I think that I'm losing my mind
So, release me now

Different ways we have in this life
Our common life is far away from love

Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done

When you open your eyes for the new dawn
I'll be gone and you now know how to live your life

Different ways we have in this life
Our common life is far away from love

Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done

Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done

I think that I'm losing my mind so release me now
Too many lies for my pride, so I say goodbye

Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done
Our truth's made of lies
This silence is killing me
I believe I'm done
