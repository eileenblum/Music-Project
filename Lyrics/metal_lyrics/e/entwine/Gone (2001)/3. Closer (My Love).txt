[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - TAURIAINEN]

Closer my love
Veil me with your warmth
Oh how afraid we are

I hold my breath
I try to hide my pain
Here in your embrace
So this pain would be gone

This time I want you to
Dry all your tears as we make...

Love...
For the last time
Replace your heart with
Mine...
Deep inside
Please stay with me through the night

I rinse my face
With your tears
Too many tears for the end
Darling, please, don't you cry

You hold your breath
You try to hide your pain
Here in my embrace
So this pain would be gone

This time I want you to
Dry all your tears as we make...

Love...
For the last time
Replace your heart with
Mine...
Deep inside
Please stay with me through the
Night...
For the last time
Replace your heart with
Mine...
Deep inside
Please stay with me through the night

Fly without sorrow
In my dreams we meet again
For you I live, I would die for you
You'll stay deep inside in my heart
