[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE]

I see a million stars ahead
I smell the heaven scent
This sadness stains all red
The nightfall's filled with ecstasy
The dusk descends on me
Soon we will be free

We must find the haven for our souls
'Cos we know that we have lost our will to live

Snow white suicide
The end is on its way
Snow white suicide
No longer burns the flame

We are kissed by the flaming frost
It seems that all is lost
Time is running out
The darkest light enwreathes the night
I'll leave it all behind
This is our last good-bye

We must find the haven for our souls
'Cos we know that we have lost our will to live

Snow white suicide
The end is on its way
Snow white suicide
No longer burns the flame

Snow white suicide
The end is on its way
Snow white suicide
No longer burns the flame

I see a million stars ahead
I smell the heaven scent
This sadness stains all red

We must find the haven for our souls
'Cos we know that we have lost our will to live

Snow white suicide
The end is on its way
Snow white suicide
No longer burns the flame
