[MIKKOLA - ENTWINE - MIKKOLA]

I see your eyes
So sadly mesmerized
I feel your gaze
So dead and confined

I have never felt inside
So alone in my life
As I wander thru the darkness
I've been searching all my life
For you to make me feel alive
As I wander thru the darkness

All my life
I've waited for this
All my life
I've been longing for you

I have never felt inside
So alone in my life
As I wander thru the darkness
I've been searching all my life
For you to make me feel alive
As I wander thru the darkness

Oh...

I have never felt inside
So alone in my life
As I wander thru the darkness
I've been searching all my life
For you to make me feel alive
As I wander thru the darkness
