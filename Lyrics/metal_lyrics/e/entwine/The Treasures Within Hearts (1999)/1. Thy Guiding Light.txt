Wish I could always love you, 
always hold you, all the time
Share with me the last moment, 
for I'll take you, to the sky

you always wanted to be the last one
but you never thought what it would be like
to be the only one

To the sky I will reflect my love 
for it shal be thy guiding light
Shine so bright that you will find your way 
through the darkness of the night

Through the skies I will take you, 
find the time to touch the stars
Falling dark leads you to me, 
whispers so sweet leave no scars

you always wanted to be the last one
but you never thought what it would be like
to be the only one

To the sky I will reflect my love for it 
shall be thy guiding light
Shine so bright the you will find your way 
through the darkness of the night
