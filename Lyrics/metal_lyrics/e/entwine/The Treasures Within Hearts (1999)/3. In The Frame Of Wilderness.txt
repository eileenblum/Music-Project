The sky dressed in red by midsummer sunset, 
lake so tranquil filled with thy scarlet tears
Enchantress my queen of nightfall,
thy mesmeric gaze will take command
(in the frame of the wilderness)

The dusk descends and sadly entwines the shades, 
in the pale moonlight, full of whispers
Over the forest (creeping) mist brings desires, 
silhouettes sank by silvery sea

The passion reigns as the grey haze caresses thee, 
the splendour of beauty, mysterious and seductive
In the frame of wilderness, so serene, 
the spell which thou cast on me

For thee enchantress all the angels weep
Nightshades increased by silver tears
