The magic of the moment puts a spell on me, 
yes I watch you closely
To kiss your lips then I'll forever rest in peace, 
yes your eyes they drown me

Please, don't let this night be over
Please don't let this night be over

No wind, no storm can break this bond between you and me, 
no, it grows on stronger

Please, don't let this night be over
Please don't let this night be over
