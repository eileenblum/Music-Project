Shedding blood and tears to deliver 
the pain of broken years, hollow cold despair
The time is running out as the beautiful sun 
is going down, darkened solitude
will show the way

No more drops of loss, no fear
Deliverance, warm embrace

Confined by misery, as I drift towards my destiny, 
sanguine emptiness
Anticipate the dawn, it's clear now where the line is drawn, 
creeping end is near,
eternal sleep

No more drops of loss, no fear
Deliverance, warm embrace
