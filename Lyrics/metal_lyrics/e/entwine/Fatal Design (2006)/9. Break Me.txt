You raped me with your lies
You hurt me deep inside
Some might say I'm not the fortunate one
You love to break me down
But I'll stay to hear you out
Some might say that I'm the fallen one
Lead me out from the dark
and kill my pain

[refrain:]
Bring it up
Tear me down
May the world go round and round
At the end of desire
your world falls down and dies
Bring it on
How could you let me down
And blame me for what you've done
After all I think that you're the fallen one
Fleeting touch in the dark
'Cause my pain

[refrain]

I gotta sell my Soul
You raped me with your lies
It hurt me deep inside
Some might say I'm not the fortunate one
You love to bring me down
But I'll stay to hear you out
Some might say that I'm the fallen one
Free me now
Crawling on my soul

[refrain]

May the world go round and round (and round)
The world go round and round (3x)
