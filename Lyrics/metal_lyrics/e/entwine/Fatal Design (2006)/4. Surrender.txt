I'm on my way
I'm on my way to lose it all
I'm a stranger to myself, I can't go on
I'm all outta space
And I'm surrounded by the wall
I believe that my mind has caught a million storms
Falling down
When you lose all that you are

[refrain:]
I surrender
I kneal down
I surrender...
I'm outta faith
I think I'm frail design of life
Deep inside in denial
The shades have grown in silence
I hide my face
I close my eyes
Deep inside in my mind the pain has
corner around me
Falling down
When you lose all that you are

[refrain 2 (2x):]
I surrender
I kneal down
I'm dying to find the reason to hold on
Call the lies! Call the lies!
I surrender...

[refrain]

[refrain 2]
