Get out of your shell before you accuse me
'cause you're the one who's spinning around
Spill it out!
Watch your ways and try not to please me
Please yourself, you rag doll of love
Spit your lies of all the things you could do for me
I'm too tired of this whole god damn freak show

[refrain:]
Far from disorder
I find serenity
I will let you go [3x]
... for life
Sell your soul to someone who makes you feel so fine
May the glare last more than one whole day
Your bitchin' around, it doesn't fit in me
So I turn around and close the door

[refrain]
