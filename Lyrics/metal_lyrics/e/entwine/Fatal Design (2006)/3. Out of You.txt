Beautiful morning's breaking
Leaving us all behind
All of the gloomy faces
And all the truth we hide
Nail me up, crucify
I'm on my way to the freeway
Nailm me up, testify
Not none of your lies will hurt me no more

[refrain:]
Strain the truth, print your lies
Let me fall into the other side
Bail me... Bail me out... of you!
Now that our lies is wasted
There's no use to look behind
Only the burned down places
Reminds us of what we used to have

[refrain 2:]
Strain the truth, print your lies
Let me fall into the other side
Bail me out and I'll be gone
Fading out of your soul
I won't be there for you anymore
Nail me up, crucify
I'm on my way to the freeway
Nailm me up, testify
Not none of your lies will hurt me no more
Now that our life is wasted there's no use to let me hide

[refrain 2]
