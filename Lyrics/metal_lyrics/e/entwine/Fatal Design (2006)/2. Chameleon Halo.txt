You are going under
Deep inside your hear the silent scream
You are filled with anger
Bitter sides want to be apart of you
Scream when you fall
Scream and let it go

[refrain:]
All the lies entwined around your soul
In your chameleon halo
It's all in your head but it's not your role
You've got to get away from the dark
You are the rising thunder
Deep inside you hold a violent scene
You are hates creation
But what you really are it depends on you
Scream when when you fall
Scream and let it go

[refrain (2x)]
