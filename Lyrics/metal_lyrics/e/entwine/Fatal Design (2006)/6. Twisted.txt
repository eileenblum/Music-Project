The devil dwells in you
So needless to say, it's gettin stronger day by day
You fall into decay, your state of mind is crumbling
You lose it all, You've lost yourself and again you're falling
Shades of gray are descending
From the sky above you

[refrain:]
I... I will be the one who takes you away from all your dreams
Twisting outside of your empty shell
Chaos deep inside
Consuming every moment of yout wretched life
Confusion rises high, your state of mind is crumbling.
You'll lose it all, You've lost yourself and again you're falling.

[refrain 2:]
I... I will be the one who takes you away from all your dreams
Twisting underneath the surface
I... I will be the one who takes you away from all your dreams
Twisting outside of your empty shell
The fields of grain are turned to dust
The seeds of hate are rooted deep into you
