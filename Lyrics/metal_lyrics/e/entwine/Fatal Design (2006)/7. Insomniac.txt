Awake in my sleep
And I hear the sound, the endless scream
I try to break out
(but) The flames around, they burn me to the ground

[refrain:]
It's not the way that I can't control the pain
My soul's too tired to crawl through the vagabond life
Freakin' out what it does to please me
Within me I hope that I'll stay strong
Drainpipe dreams of life
Awake from my sleep
But still I hear the sound, of an endless dream
I hate to be afraid
This insanity leads me astray

[refrain]

Facing out into the unknown
State of mind lays crushed on a floor
Glacial life rephrase what you are
Rephrase, replace, replace
