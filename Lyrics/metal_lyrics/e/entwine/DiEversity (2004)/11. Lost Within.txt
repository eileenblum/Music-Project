Beneath the Surface of my skin
In this loneliness that I'm lost within
(with you)
I close my eyes
Wish you could be true
Wish I could fill you with these words
"I dream of you"

I'd do anything to hold your grace
I'd never face another day without your love

The highest highs and the lowest lows
I'll face the life in it's cruel way
We shall never give in the pain
I'm drowning into your eyes
I'm drowning into you
