You're drowning in your life
Without a reason why
You're crashing down
So, vulnerable and so, fragile
You create your mind
To defend your crown
No desire for life
You're surrounded by
The endless night
No place to run
No place to hide

Your life's waiting to fall
Fading out with flow
And your deeds will be gone
Out of reach to the cold
Six feet down below

You're drifting out of sight
Without a reason why
You're crashing down
So, vulnerable and so, fragile
You create your mind
To defend your ground
(you hide behind these walls)
Lost without a soul
Into the flames of guilt you fall
When there's no light
In your mind

Out of love
In your decay
No one know
How to be safe
