Way far beyond
Inside of me
Where I hide to be alone
For my beloved
Sometimes I need my space
Please try to get long
(with me)

Fill my whole life
With your heart of gold
You're my suicide
The sweetest of them all

Soften my fall
Thru' all these fears
When I try to get along
You're my beloved
In your embrace I'll fall
There I'm safe and not alone
