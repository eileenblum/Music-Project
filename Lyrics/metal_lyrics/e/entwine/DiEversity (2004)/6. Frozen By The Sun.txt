I will keep on looking far beyond the sun
I've never felt this way before
That all we know is here
Lost within the nothingness
And all we feel is here
Here inside this emptiness

The pain is getting strong
It's getting stronger than me
But I will never lose my faith in you

I can't bring you back
(though I tried)
I threw it all away
(when I lied to you)

Here I lay beside the angel of betrayal
I hear the voices calling my name

So, distant you've become it's haunting me
I've done wrong but could you forgive me?

You see me tryin'
You see me dyin'
And loosing all my faith
