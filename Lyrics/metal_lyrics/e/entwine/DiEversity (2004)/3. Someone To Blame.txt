How come you're blaming me about
The things I have never done
It's such a shame
Well, it's your weakness that you hide
So, don't tell me how to live my life
'Cause you're so lame

You may steal my wings tonight
But I'll pay you back for your surprise
(you know where you all belong)
You may need my rage to fight
And I'll tear you down with my device
(you know where you all belong)

Well, I suppose you have the facts
To criticize me all the time
Are you the judge who decides?

It's your time to cry
I'll wash you away
I will be your doom and disgrace
