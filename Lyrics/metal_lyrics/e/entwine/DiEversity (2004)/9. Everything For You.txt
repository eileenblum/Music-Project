I hide my thoughts
Behind these truthfull lies
So, I swell
No sense of time

I'm lost inside my head
So, I throw my life away
(I'd give everything for you)

I'm lost inside
Without you I'm not free
And for your love
I'm struggling in between

I hide my thoughts
Behind these truthfull lies
It's my spell
With you my life's
So sacred and secure
I long to live for you

How many lives do I have to live
Without your touch on my skin
How many tears I have to cry
Without you here by my side
