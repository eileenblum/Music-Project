Now left behind in the wake of my own entropy
This disease surfaces within me, a means to an end....
Every step I take, leads me closer, it leads me closer to the start
You stranded me with nothing but a nightmare
I can read you like the back of my hand
So I suggest you give me your all
And there is nothing in this world I can do
To get you out of this hole that you've dug for yourself
I swear to god I'll put you back in your place
Back before you even knew my name
I swear to god I'll put you back in your place
Back before you even knew my name
Don't forget
You've brought this upon yourself
Hear me now; what's done is done (Repeat)
And no one can save you now...
Every step I take, leads me closer, it leads me closer to the start
You stranded me with nothing but a nightmare
Now I'll be sending you off to a one-way street with a one-way ticket home
Left forever in a moment without a way to save you from yourself
How did you think this would all turn out?
Don't you know what you'll get when you play with fire?
It was you who poured the gas and then struck the match
But you never looked back to see if the flames consumed me
Every step I take leads me closer...
And now I'm stranded, face to face with a fucking nightmare.
