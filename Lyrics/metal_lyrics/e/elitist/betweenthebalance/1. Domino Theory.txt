No one said this would be easy
What will it take for you to see clearly?
Watch closely, and take your time
Cut it slowly
Omit the ties
I can see through you
And it's the sight of your insides that leaves me trembling
Don't turn away
You're meant for more then you know
Just find the courage to say I won't let go
I see, I see you looking for the exit
I know you're scared, scared your all alone, scared you're just a face
Scared you're just a face
Just another pretty face
Stop looking for an exit
In spite of all of the things you say
I still believe it remains to be unseen
How can you be so sure of this life you chose?
I always knew there was something missing
I always knew there was something wrong
How can you be so sure of this life you chose?
How can you stand and look yourself in the mirror
How could you just forget everything?
How can you stand and look yourself in the mirror
And just forget everything?
