I bet it eats you up on the inside
Knowing your nothing but a fake
I bet it eats you up alive
When will you see that you'll never be me?
When will you see that you'll never be me?

In this isolated world you have made for yourself
The only view you have is through my window
And you replicate everything you see
You try to project like what's mine is you're best
But still you'll never be me
Put your name on the tag call it what you want
You'll still never be me

I always knew you'd come crawling back to me
But there's no respect for you left
You never did anything worth mentioning
So go find your own identity (Go find your own identity)

I'm always on to the next big thing
Your always three paces behind me
And when they come to collect on your head
What will you have to show them?
When I'm not around, when I'm seeing the world, who will you turn to then?

I always knew you'd come crawling back to me
But there's no respect for you left
You never did anything worth mentioning
So go find your own identity (Go find your own identity)

I can't carry you through this life; it's not what I had in mind
You're on you're own (This time you're out on your own)
This is not what I had in mind to carry you through this life
You're on your own (This time you're out on your own)
