I wander in a distant land
Unnoticed by anyone
My reach expands to the clouds
My stride moves swiftly over the oceans
But it's like I'm a ghost
Am I destined to always be lone?
I am a giant
And there's nobody to see me standing tall
I am a giant
And there's nobody to hear my voice
I am a giant
And no one sees me standing tall
I am a giant
And there's no one to hear my voice say (I'm alone)
I am a giant
And no one seems to see me standing tall
I am a giant
And there's no one to hear my voice at all
Will someone ever notice me?
Will I ever be complete?
Will someone notice me?
Will I ever be complete?
I sit back and watch the sky as it turns to night
Signaling the end of a new day
But internally, consciously I know it's all the same
If I never sleep or dare to dream
