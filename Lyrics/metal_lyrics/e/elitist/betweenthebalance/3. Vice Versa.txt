What lies on the other side?
Between the balance of everything I else I hope to become
And what I choose to believe
In one hand, complete control
In the other no remorse
Why can't I see that I've already won?
Face down lie the enemies that I swore I would never become
I know when you look into my eyes you know exactly what it feels like
To have the ground removed from under you're feet
If I though it would be like this
I would swallow the pill just to end it
Will we ever meet half way?
My eyes roll up to the back of my head and then I drift away
I would give, I would give up everything for just a taste of what it's like
On top of the world
What lies on the other side?
Between the balance of everything I hope to become
And what I choose to believe
In one hand, complete control
In the other, no remorse
We seek to find worth and purpose
We seek to find our dreams
Between the balance of everything we choose to believe
