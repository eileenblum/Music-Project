Don't turn the corner
Close your thoughts and take in only darkness
You can't spark what is not really there, let it consume you
The sounds of no one there
Feel the breath of your raging fear
The sounds of no one there
Feel the breath of your raging fear

The demons are getting closer, the blood boils within your veins
Feel yourself turn away
Feel yourself cry in pain
Undertake the struggle and solve conflict

Every single breath you take, you take in what fears you most, in this dying
world
There is no reason, it's only isolation 
You are alone
Are you strong enough? 

Rise above the tide

Let there be light
Surrounded by darkness
Let there be light

The demons are getting closer, the blood boils within your veins
Let there be light upon this earth

There is no reason, there's isolation
You are alone

Don't turn the corner, close your thoughts
Take in darkness
