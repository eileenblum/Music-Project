Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
Is this the road you walk upon, can you believe?
Hold on tight, never let go, let me be your guide
Don't drift away, hold on, let me save you now
Dreams are for dreamers and hopes are for the hopeless

Drift away and find your place
Take advice and find the way
Tell me you are here to stay
Make me proud, stand your ground

Hold back your temptations
Don't be the keeper of secrets

If you only knew what's in store for you
One thought after another, let me be your guide
I'm only going to follow through one last time 

Hold back your temptations
Don't be the keeper of secrets

Don't be a coward, be one with yourself
Take life in 
Don't be a coward, be one with yourself
Take life in
