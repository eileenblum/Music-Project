We build our lives upon this, all for us
I knew our determination 
You told me you felt so cold and alone
I couldn't take this in, I was so young 
I will take your hand i will guide you through this pain
This suffering, no more reality
In all due time we will be perfectly together forever
I will lift you up and take you away, we will be stronger 

I will not see the end of life
Are you alone on this planet earth?
Take my hand as well as my world
We will take everything and not look back 

We all make mistakes in a world that we don't comprehend 

We have to keep pushing, we have to fight harder 
Imagine a life so divine, you and i side by side
Dismantle our hate, feel my love for you 
I promise to bring light 
Be my fire, ignite my heart 
You're the only one for me, i swear to you 

Stick to your principles, it's all you have left
