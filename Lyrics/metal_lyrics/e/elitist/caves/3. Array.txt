Break free from your disparities 
Take the reins of your mind.
Realize the ability to think for yourself 

One of these days, you'll  follow every one
Off the edge, off the edge of the cliff  
I'll be standing in the back, watching you fall to your feet 
Move forward

It's obvious you lack the ability to form original thoughts 
In your mind, in your soul, 
Not even propaganda, you're just unable to take control
Make use of the mind, and break away
Only god knows why 

Stop listening
Stop following
Let go, take control and live your life 
I am awaken

I am awaken, you are a liar 

Remember the lessons I taught you, hold them tight
Never let them go
Hear my cry, i am alone
I am alone in this world 

This is our reason
Hear my cry
Let go of me
