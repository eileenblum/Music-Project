The blindness of his spirit led his feet towards the unknown
And those who fell in the past are here to take over his soul

Yet he fails
He fails to recognize the light
We are in the presence of innefable energy

That could bring his soul back to life [x2]
The choice is in your hands, it will bring you back to life [x2]

Let it blossom and shine away, illuminate your biggest fears and simply walk away [x2]

Yet he allows it to slip through his fingers
Those trembling hands
Wake up and make the last step
The last step towards the end

He never stopped believing
He never stopped having faith
He never stopped believing
He never stopped

He never stopped believing
He never stopped having faith
He never stopped believing
He never stopped believing
