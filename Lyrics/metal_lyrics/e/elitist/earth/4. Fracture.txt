We are 
We are dead to the world
And we are dead to the world 
We're sealed away from

From those wandering eyes (from those wandering eyes) 
From those wandering eyes
And everything around us 
Everything around us seemes to stir

We gazed at the pale grey lustrous ocean 
As it fades away.
As it washes away, washes away all our dreams. 
As it washes, away.

And one and only, single fractured idea 
Managed to make its way, to the end of it all.
So contagious but yet so flawless, 
Just try, just try to stop us now, 

Just try to stop us now.
