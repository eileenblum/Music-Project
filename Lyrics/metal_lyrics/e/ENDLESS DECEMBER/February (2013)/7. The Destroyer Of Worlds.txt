[Verse:]
I am destroyer of worlds
I am destroyer of all things holy
Pray to your god today
Wont make a difference anyway
Pray to your god today
So that he may watch you as you die

[Chorus:]
You are on your own
You are on your own, now.

[Verse:]
Please spare me, is what you say to me
And there is nothing and no there's no one
I laugh at your fearful ways
There's no one waiting for you anyway

I am destroyer of worlds
beyond compare there's no one else

[Chorus:]
You are on your own
You are on your own, now.

[Bridge:]
Breathe now it's time to die
Breathe now it's time to die
My being is forevermore
and there is no one out there
to save you
no one out there to save you

[Chorus:]
You are on your own
You are on your own, now.
