[Chorus:]
This charcoal portrait you paint is gray but you never knew
These colors in which I hold in my hand,available to you

[Verse:]
A touch of gray is upon your skin but my colors are blind to it
I've tried to fight and I've waited all my fucking life
Now

My colors they stain you
Saturated they bind you!

[Chorus:]
This charcoal portrait you paint is gray but you never knew
These colors in which I hold in my hand,available to you

[Verse:]
A touch of color is upon my skin,and I know you've searched for it
You've tried to fight and you've waited all your fucking life

My colors they blind you!
Saturated they bind you.

See now! But your black and your grays
See now! Enveloping me.

[Chorus:]
This charcoal portrait you paint is gray but you never knew
These colors in which I hold in my hand,available to you

Open your eyes,open your eyes to life 
Time will fly,by.

[Verse:]
See now! My colors they blind you
See now! Saturated they bind
You!

Stare a little harder,cause I need you to

Hey,What do you see?
My colors are mixed with gray
Dark and Vivid to me
I see what you see

Hey! I'll tell you what I see
My colors are staining thee
I think we see the same
My colors mixed with your grays

[Chorus:]
This charcoal portrait you paint is gray but you never knew
These colors in which I hold in my hand you thought you'd never choose.

Never.Choose.
