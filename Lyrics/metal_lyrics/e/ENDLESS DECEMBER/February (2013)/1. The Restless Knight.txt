[Verse:]
I'm supposed to be tough!

Stop and stare!
Into my soul,My armored plating lets you know
The hell that I've been through,it always shows

I have been!
Trying to change this,letting go of my armaments

"Stop!"
She says "You don't really need them you're safe with me"

[Chorus:]
Don't take my shield away!
Protect me from,Today.
Don't take my sword away!
Blood stains of frost,Blue-gray.

[Verse:]
Their hammers of sorrow
have tempered me to be this way
Still cant believe I played their games,So hopeful

If you and I dont feel the same,I'm the only mother fucker to blame.

"Stop,You dont really need that
and soon you may see that,You will be okay"

NO! How do you know?!
I slowly glance beyond my shield to see you.

[Chorus:]
Don't take my shield away!
Protect me from,Today.
Don't take my sword away!
Blood stains of frost,Blue-gray.

[Bridge:]
I'm supposed to be tough!
yea!
"Lower your shield for me"
"Lower your sword for me"

She says I dont really need them
"stop and hand over them one by one
one by one"

[Chorus:]
Don't take my shield away!
Protect me from,Today.
Don't take my sword away!
Blood stains of frost,Blue-gray.
