[The Frost King:]
Time Keeper! I demand that you defend yourself!
For I as the god of ice, Will destroy you!
should you not turn back time

For Aeons I've decimated beings just as strong as you
beings just as grand as you, I will fucking destroy you!
Should you not bring my loved ones back to me!
Me!

[The Time Keeper:]
For millenia I've counted time!
and I serve purpose, You must believe this

[The Frost King:]
Ask me for mercy and I will show you none
Just as you took the only one from me,
Can't you see what you've done to me
I will do to thee, times 3, Better fucking believe
I demand upon thee to set time free

I demand you! bring her back to me!
I command you! bring her back to me!
Please..

[The Time Keeper:]
For millenia I've counted time!
and I serve purpose, You must believe this

As I hear your lonely plight
set down your blades for just tonight
your lust for war it chills the sky
your duty's tough, but so is mine

For millenia I've counted time!
and I serve purpose, You must believe this!
