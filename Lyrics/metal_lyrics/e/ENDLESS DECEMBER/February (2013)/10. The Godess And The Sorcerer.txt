[Bystander:]
I'm feeling lost at sea
and I feel her beauty beckoning me
come with me, You dont have to live your life this way

[The Sorcerer:]
Why should I believe you?!
Though her glass eyes may mesmerize
her love it blinds
I will not let her shackle

[Bystander:]
Godess of the sea,
I feel your waves
crash down on me
crash down on me
Great Sorcerer you'll see
You'll feel her waves
crash down on thee
crash down on thee

I dive to cleanse disease
and I feel your force beckoning me
come with me
you dont have to live your life this way

[The Sorcerer:]
But, I cant trust you
Though her glass eyes may mesmorize
her love blinds
I will not let her shackle me

[Bystander:]
Godess of the sea,
I feel your waves
crash down on me
crash down on me
Great Sorcerer you'll see
You'll feel her waves
crash down on thee
crash down on thee

[The Sorcerer:]
Her cleansing waters
BURN!
I stand in horror
Enthralled by your power
My fears burn away
Her cleansing waters
FREEZE!
I feel at ease
I'm cleansed by your waters
My hate shatters away
away!

[Bystander:]
Godess of the sea,
I feel your waves
crash down on me
crash down on me
Great Sorcerer you'll see
You'll feel her waves
crash down on thee
crash down on thee
