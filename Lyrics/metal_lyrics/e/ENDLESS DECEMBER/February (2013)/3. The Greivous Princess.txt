[Verse:]
Destroy all the mother fuckers in the world,
Tellin' you, If I cant have you, They cant have you
Sickening watching someone else keep what I need
Hope is gone this time, Isn't it princess?
Can't make this cunt mine and it's fine

[Chorus:]
Should you never!
I will stand alone.
stand alone [2x]

[Verse:]
Chain this mother fucking bitch into a damp dark cellar
where I will rape her and I will taste her
Oh I believe you think this might be the thing that you need
You need!
Scream for me baby!
'cause I'm the only one that can hear you
Cum for me baby!
You know I want you!

[Chorus:]
Should you never!
I will stand alone
stand alone [2x]

[Bridge:]
I didn't want for it to be this way
but tell me, How does my cum taste?

Dirty girl,
At one time yes you were my world
but the times are changing isn't that what you had wanted baby?
Scream my name, From anyone else it doesn't sound the same
Scream my name, From anyone else it doesn't sound the same

[Chorus:]
Should you never!
I will stand alone
stand alone [2x]
