[Young man:]
Yeah!

I feel like a million bucks
straight, ready to rage
and not giving a fuck
and I'm fucking'em up
even steel isn't as tough

Feel that young blood burn through me
Look at what you see
and I will always be free
from
Age!

I will not succumb to
Age!
I will live forever!
I will not succumb to
Age!

[The Elder:]
The youth that you have have wont last you forever
so don't take for granted all the time you're given [2x]

[Young man:]
Fuck that!
I ain't tryina hear that shit!
For real
'Cause it's the only thing I feel
is real

Feel the young blood burn through me
stare at what you see
and I will always be free
from
Age!

I will not succumb to
Age!
I will live forever!
I will not succumb to
Age!

[The Elder:]
The youth that you have have wont last you forever
so don't take for granted all the time you're given [2x]

[Young Man:]
NO!
AGING!
NO!
AGING!
I!
WILL!
NOT!
AGE!!!
