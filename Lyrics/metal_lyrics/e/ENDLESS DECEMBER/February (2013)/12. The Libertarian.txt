[Chorus:]
You must not forget!
I need this
You need this [2x]

[Verse:]
For over a hundred years
our people have let go of their strength and grade
for over a hundred years
our people have let themselves become disgrace

My brothers in arms
stand with your people
stand up strong
My brothers in arms
stand with your people
stand up strong

Cause it's the only thing that will save us!
Cause it's the only thing that will save us!

[Chorus:]
You must not forget!
I need this
You need this [2x]

[Bridge:]
I will fight for those.
Who wont understand
I will fight for those
Who wont make a stand
I will fight for those!

Stand tall and protect your families
My brothers
For your loved ones,
and your Mothers and daughters
Fight for your people
Protect your people
Slavery, Will not ensnare me

[Chorus:]
You must not forget!
I need this
You need this [2x]

My brothers in arms
stand with your people
stand up strong
My brothers in arms
stand with your people
stand up strong
