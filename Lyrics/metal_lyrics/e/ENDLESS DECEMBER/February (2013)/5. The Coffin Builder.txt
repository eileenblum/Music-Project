[Verse:]
Dear,
What happened to all the warmth you gave to me
it's dead and cold as far as I can see
What do you believe?
Dear,
You're getting cold to the touch but I still believe
so what do we do tonight
you've lost this fight

[Chorus:]
There she goes decaying
I'll never care
I court the dead
I court the dead [2x]

[Verse:]
Dear,
What happened to all the love you gave to me
your body's dead and cold as I can see
What do you believe?
Love,
You said you'd be here with me for eternity
So what do we do tonight
you've lost this fight

[Chorus:]
There she goes decaying
I'll never care
I court the dead
I court the dead [2x]

[Bridge:]
Love!

Love, Return to me
Return to me!

[Chorus:]
There she goes decaying
I'll never care
I'll court the dead
I'll court the dead [2x]
