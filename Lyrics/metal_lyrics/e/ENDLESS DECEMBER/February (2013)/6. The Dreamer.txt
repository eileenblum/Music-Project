[Verse:]
Wake up dear you've been injured
These cars just drive by her
I can't allow you to be alone

Your eyes seem so lifeless
how could someone do this
But I'll help you fight this

[Chorus:]
So I'm waiting out your slumber
When you awake will you remember [2x]

[Verse:]
Her eyes become darker
Her skin a little paler
I care but don't know her

Breathe now, I beg
Breathe now, I beg!

[Chorus:]
So I'm waiting out your slumber
When you awake will you remember [2x]

[Bridge:]
Pull through!
You can!
cause I believe in you
Pull through, you can! [2x]

[Chorus:]
So I'm waiting out your slumber
When you awake will you remember [2x]

[Bridge:]
Hope is not lost

Pull through!
You can!
cause I believe in you
Pull through!You can
Pull through!
