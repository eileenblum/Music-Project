[Verse:]
I've only got seconds to live
And I don't understand
how could you do this?
This!
My eyes only got seconds to see
seconds to see you as you see me
look at me
Me!

Why?!
I'm sure you feel now that your god will condemn you
Right?!
after all that I've done is this what it comes down to
Bright!!
I see the vivid light beyond my life
Dark!!
Your soul inside

[Chorus:]
Grip a little bit tighter
The flash hits the powder
It's never been louder
My eyes clear like a window
You'll never forget though
I stare at my widow

[Verse:]
My mind only as seconds to think
seconds to think about the way
you used to love me
My heart's only got seconds to feel
seconds to feel the way I used to fucking love you

Look at Me!

Why?!
I'm sure you feel now that your god will condemn you
Right?!
after all that I've done is this what it comes down to
Bright!!
I see the vivid light beyond my life
Dark!!
Your soul inside

[Chorus:]
Grip a little bit tighter
The flash hits the powder
It's never been louder
My eyes clear like a window
You'll never forget though
I stare at my widow

[Bridge:]
Pull me down
to your level
pull me down
as dead as you
pull me down
to your level
pull me down
so I can be as dead as you!!

[Chorus:]
Grip a little bit tighter
The flash hits the powder
It's never been louder
My eyes clear like a window
You'll never forget though
I stare at my widow
