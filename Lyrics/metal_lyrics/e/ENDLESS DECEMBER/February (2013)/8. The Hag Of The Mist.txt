[Verse]
Sometimes the things you say they fucking sicken me
the love I had you beat that shit right out of me
You have now all that you wanted
inside I felt beyond daunted,
I will no longer be haunted!

[Chorus]
So now that you're happy,
Do you at last leave me be.
allow this to die,
for you were not meant for me.

[Verse]
You have now all you could ask for
but like a blackhole you want much more
want much .. more!

[Bridge]
Stick to your guns, Tell me I'll never be the one
Stick to your guns,
Are you not satisfied?
What the fuck do you need from me
Are you not satisfied?
what the fuck do you need from me
why are you not satisfied!

[Chorus]
So now that you're happy,
Do you at last leave me be.
allow this to die,
for you were not meant for me.

[Bridge]
I'm starting to think that she was fucking right
you're.. Sick!
I'm starting to think that she was fucking right
you're.. Sick!

Stick to your guns
Tell me I'll never be the one
are you not satisfied?
what the fuck do you need from me
