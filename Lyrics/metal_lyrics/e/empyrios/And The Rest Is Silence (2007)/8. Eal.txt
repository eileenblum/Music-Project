Like an ending smile
You're fading away
Like the first time
I meet with you
And now I understand
What's happening in this
Cold day, a sun that lit my way
You were too "old"
To speak to me for real
Like a boy I was standing
At the phone
Waiting for your call
But everything it's clear for now
It's better to wait again...

I'm forever by your side
Through good and bad days
My friendship is true and strong
And you can trust me, tell me all your fears
If you search for something warm
Like a sweet embrace
You know where you can find me
In every moment, in every place, oh Eal...

Like the wheel of time
All things must change
Everything we believed
Now it's changing its course
- all who we have loved...
All we need now, it's to turn
And don't look back in time
(Don't look back)
Trust in me, and carry on your life
(Don't look back again)
You just need, a real and sweet good friend

I'm forever by your side
Through good and bad days
My friendship is true and strong
And you can trust me, tell me all your fears
If you search for something warm
Like a sweet embrace
You know where you can find me
In every moment, in every place, oh Eal...

I'm forever by your side
Through good and bad days
My friendship is true and strong
And you can trust me, tell me all your fears
If you search for something warm
Like a sweet embrace
You know where you can find me
In every moment, in every place, oh Eal...
