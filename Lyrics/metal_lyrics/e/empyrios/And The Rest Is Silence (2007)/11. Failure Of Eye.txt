Calm and fearless every day
On the edge of loneliness
Am I looking a way to restrain?
(my emptiness)

I cry, I try on the river so long
Of words so aimless
I wanna spit my sentence (but)
It's just a waste of breath
Just a waste of breath
Just another wasted â you instigate

Come back now to your memories and past
And on your knees you ask for mercy
for another breath
I must pay for your emptiness of brain
I'd not believe your foolish words
Gotta stop trying out

Stressed and fearful from this day
Crossed the edge of hauntingness
Overlooking, collapsing my final day
(your emptiness)

You cry, you try on your ego so strong
In sorrow I tell my name
(that) Gain disilluded farewell
I've lost my meaning, man!

Come back now to your memories and past
And on your knees you ask for mercy
for another breath
I must pay for your emptiness of brain
I'd not believe your foolish words
Gotta stop trying out

Come back now to your memories and past
And on your knees you ask for mercy
for another breath
I must pay for your emptiness of brain
I'd not believe your foolish words
Gotta stop trying out
