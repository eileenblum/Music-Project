He's coming again to break my feels
As I try, going wild, to forget the past
You're coming to me, only to waste your time
Ruined another day

Nobody can see the complication (just because you lie)
Nobody can see what kind of tie we had
Have you (got) what you want?

Like a recall of you and me and
We were sons of the legacy
Then you were betraying me and burning like coal my way
Nailed from the start...

Nobody can see the variation (deep inside of mind)
Nobody can see your mad depravity

You demised, you are a falling star
You will follow me in madness...

Heaven can wait for my arrive
And inch by inch I will terrorize
Your family name will be deleted from earth surface
Ruiner must be slain

I finally see the end of this tale (with your tragic end)
I finally see that you're repenting now
Mercy's what you want?

You demised, you are a falling star
You will follow me in madness...

You demised, you are a falling star
You will follow me in madness...

You demised, you are a falling star
You will follow me in madness...
