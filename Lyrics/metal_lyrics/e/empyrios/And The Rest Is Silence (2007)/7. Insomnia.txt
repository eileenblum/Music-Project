I can't sleep now
'cause your frozen eyes
Are gazing deep in me
"All your dreams
Washed away from sins,
A crystal purity"

She returns to me
Every silent night
Of nightmares and dismay
"Hail... to me
And fall to your knees
you, insignificant!"

Here I am for you
Just tryin' out to find a way
To break this spell on me
And on my life you spit
Forever bound in solitude
Awaken from my dream!

You, my goddess
Of the worst desire
The maiden of the cold
"All your dreams
Washed away from sins,
A crystal purity"

Here I am for you
Just tryin' out to find a way
To break this spell on me
And on my life you spit
Forever bound in solitude
Awaken from my dream!

Here I am for you
Just tryin' out to find a way
To break this spell on me
And on my life you spit
Forever bound in solitude
Awaken from my dream!
