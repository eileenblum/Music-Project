While I doubt the reason to fall down
To fade away down
(Wailing wall had to say)
While I'm getting ruined
Corroded the feeling exhaled away
And washing more than my brain

Sadly fighting the way they wanted
Like drones we walk down
(Failing hopes that we gain)
While I'm tasting harder
(the) Noose running and chocking my ego decayed
I wonder: today is the day?

I'm feeling, we got change
Now crumbles maybe it's too late
Gods, may ever rest in pain
Gods, we won't pray

To the fields fading on horizon, spread your wings
Wailing for the stars
(On the fields that we blame)
Spread your wings and say
"I'll be crawling away"

Now it's time to walk on the edge of
The razor cold as ice
(Slicing open your veins)
While I'm getting ruined
Corroded the feeling my ego decayed
I'm sure today's goddamn day

(Terrorized, paralyzed)
Punching my face, erasing my race of lost sinners
(Ripping my eyes, paranoid)
Tears for fear today

To the fields fading on horizon, spread your wings
Wailing for the stars
(On the fields that we blame)
Spread your wings and say
"I'll be crawling away"

To the fields fading on horizon, spread your wings
Wailing for the stars
(On the fields that we blame)
Spread your wings and say
"I'll be crawling away"

To the fields fading on horizon, spread your wings
Wailing for the stars
Spread your wings and say
"I'll be crawling away"
