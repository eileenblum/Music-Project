Sworn not to see your faces
Sworn to sweep all your lies
Waiting the day when my tears will dry

Coming down the masquerade
Rising of the failure
Of my best desires
Looking for someone in your eyes

Nothing can break perseverance
Waiting kind of deliverance

Insane, the pain it's stunning down
Now's flowing over

Foreseeing a feeling of a day of sun
Surfing the light
I heard the call of the
Voices they're screaming out the
Sorrow unknown!

Why the tears of a dazed love,
Overshadowing, dim my soul...
I'll be looking for something to break the down, damn how long?

Nothing can break perseverance
Waiting kind of deliverance

Insane, the pain it's stunning down
Now's flowing over

Insane, the pain it's stunning down
Now's flowing over

Insane, the pain it's stunning down
Now's flowing over
