Only time can rust the season,
I'm so glad to see your shining eye
(I) Stand wondering 't the treasure found while you bleed dry
You've lost your purity!

Crossed is the holy line (that)
Conceives life and death
Suffering my womb by western lie
Never too late...

To learn, no sense of love
The seasons die, standing strongly
In front of them

Everlasting's the path I walk today
Casted inside your heart of stone
Yes, born from the ashes, dust you will return
Live: the slowest death

Crusted is the holy wine
Abandon this earth (I will)
Held down by bonds just seen and said
Now it's too late...

To learn, no sense of love
The seasons die, standing strongly
In front of them

To learn, no sense of love
The seasons die, standing strongly
In front of them

To learn, no sense of love
The seasons die, standing strongly
In front of them
