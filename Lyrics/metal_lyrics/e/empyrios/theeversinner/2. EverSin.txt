Light fading out
In my own cell
They have no doubt...
Misunderstanding
Closed in my agony...

Waiting for
The judgement fall
The final act
Of what I've been,
What I will be (is)
In their fucking hands!

Face the dawn
I'm paralyzed
They'll strike me down
Their eyes are blind
The final sentence closing in...

The EverSin is
How they called
"the perfect kill" or
"full carnage"
But I'm sure that
The sin's not mine!

Will you ever understand
My agony
Will you realize the truth behind
Judgement falls...

The arm of death
Embracing me
The prison's clash
Proclaims my name
Is whispering
The sound of thrill

I'm standing still
In my own cell
I finally see
The stairs of hell
I'm climbing to
The final floor!!

Will you ever understand
My agony
Will you realize the truth behind
Judgement falls...

The judgement falls again
They take another life
Now, the EverSin expiated
I must pay with my life!

Will you ever understand
My agony
Will you realize the truth inside
Judgement falls...

Will you ever understand
My agony
Will you realize the truth inside
