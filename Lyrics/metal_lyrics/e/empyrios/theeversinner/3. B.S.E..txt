Bemused
Too much fire flows through my veins...
Searching, I'm trying
To be myself again
Praying, invoking
To drive my pain away

I want to kill, to be forgiven
I want to slay and then run away

It's time to break free
I need to cry the tears of love
And stop to cry yells of hate...
BrainStorm Evilution

Unaware...
Justice will see a guilty of madness
Searching, I'm trying
To be myself again
Praying, invoking
To escape from this odd jail

I want to kill, to be forgiven
I want to slay and then run away

It's time to break free
I need to cry the tears of love
And stop to cry yells of hate...

I want to kill, to be forgiven
I want to slay and then run away

It's time to break free
I need to cry the tears of love
And stop to cry yells of hate...

Evolution...
