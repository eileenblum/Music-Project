The night awaits me
I dream with open eyes
The system corrupted in crisis
They sold my life, an outward journey

The perfect project
Fills my twisted mind
A secret conspiracy is rising
A new society.

For a renown that I will never enjoy
For a country I will see no more.
I'll be only ash and I won't fight the war
That I unchained, ready to die!!

I have no prayers
Like their scheming lies
I'm serving the others' vainglory
I'll leave the pain, behind me wretched

And for the last time
I look my world around
The colours, the sounds and the smells
Will die with me!

For a renown that I will never enjoy
For a country I will see no more.
I'll be only ash and I won't fight the war
That I unchained, ready to die!!

For a renown that I will never enjoy
For a country I will see no more.
I'll be only ash and I won't fight the war
That I unchained, ready to die!!
