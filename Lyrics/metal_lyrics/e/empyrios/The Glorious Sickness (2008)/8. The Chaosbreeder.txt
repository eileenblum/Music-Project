I am condemned to shatter you away
Dispersed from my universe I have just lost fragments of humanity

I'm the hero of agony

Centuries of misery blasted in a day
The venom pulsing deep into my veins, consequences I'll face

Remote on its control a mind tech machine
Born entropy every last cell made of supreme hate
The Chaosbreeder

I will not make return to my reality
The day of my sickness is turning today in my afterpiece

Sick one I'm bearing woe for unforgiven faults

Remote on its control a mind tech machine
Born entropy every last cell made of supreme hate
The Chaosbreeder

Sick one I'm bearing woe for unforgiven faults
Today have something painsick take your life away

Remote on its control a mind tech machine
Born entropy every last cell made of supreme hate
The Chaosbreeder
