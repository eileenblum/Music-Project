All hope is lost they who enter here
Now the day dissolving into thin air
Browning shed lies that way
They eternal slaves
Browning shed, here lies that way
Hiding me from dead rain

Here I ask for aid my sweet Eve, guide my divine entrance

Take this ride through you, in the scattering ashes of my wound
This Boulevard is the way that runs among the lost

Last hope crossed following the trail
So this way drives us to hopless place
Rather twisted game
She has told me I shall see the souls enslaved by those suckers

Here I'm madly brave, on my path planting seeds of vengeance

Take this ride through you, in the scattering ashes of my wound
This Boulevard is the way that runs among the lost

(I have told you we shall see the souls to misery doomed, who intellectual good have lost
And when her hand she had stretched forth to mine, everything won't be the same will never be the same)

Way to decadence, way of abhorrence,
Hear the consequence, my omnipotence

Take this ride through you, in the scattering ashes of my wound
This Boulevard is the way that runs among the lost
