Fallen the night my embers until the morning see just needed a turn on this life
To have the rights to feel just a being unto this globe

I breed a virus within, I witness pain
I hail the horror my kin, I am the Cain

To be on my feet unto this fevery world
Diseases that cures - A disease that cures

Over the realm of sickness I'll keep myself placid so drugged I'm just able to breathe
I'm haunted by this visions of grief over their lives

So disturbed can't go on never felt this well before so sure

To be on my feet unto this fevery world
Diseases that cures - A disease that cures

To be on my feet unto this fevery world
Diseases that cures - A disease that cures

To be on my feet unto this fevery world
Diseases that cures - A disease that cures
