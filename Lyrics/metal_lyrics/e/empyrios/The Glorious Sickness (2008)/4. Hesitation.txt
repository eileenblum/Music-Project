Blinded my eyes the light of Eve so today, the day I left
Blood down my hands, she taken me down to bring my pain

Pain to wake up minds so long enslaved, asleep
Where there's no more freedom

This image you are casting over me such weight cannot stand it's simply driving me insane
Don't Hesitate to show me this new world
Grave New World Dead

Deafen my ears, the voice of her telling me how to act
Legendary day for them to prove to feel again such a pain

Pain to wake up minds so long enslaved, asleep
Where there's no more freedom

This image you are casting over me such weight cannot stand it's simply driving me insane
Don't Hesitate to show me this new world
Grave New World Dead

This image you are casting over me such weight cannot stand it's simply driving me insane
Don't Hesitate to show me this new world
Grave New World Dead

You're dead, in this grave new world
