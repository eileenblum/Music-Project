One glimpse of light and silence in a pathwayout of their new painful world
Pain has reborn so has love
One dreadful sight primal pain of disdain woken up storms of dead human drones long gone

See, a New Dawn is rising on their eyes opened wide
A new pain cuts through dead and silent remains and
Brings new life new dreams of glory

Touched by this darkness striking each cloud of mortality fallen away
Love has reborn so you bare me into ray sovran girl just arose
Woke up ten thousands of souls forlorn and more

See, a New Dawn is rising on their eyes opened wide
A new pain cuts through dead and silent remains and
Brings new life new dreams of glory

Glorious Sickness when the Eve Arose
On my Sickening Pandemonium

See, a New Dawn is rising on their eyes opened wide
A new pain cuts through dead and silent remains and
Brings new life new chance to strive this Glorious Sickness
