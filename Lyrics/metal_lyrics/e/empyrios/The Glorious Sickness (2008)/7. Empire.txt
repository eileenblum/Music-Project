Collapsing now

Empire of the scumbag
Reject all the lies you forcefed them
An hook up the nose to take down the brain
This shit went on just too long, far too long
You took the life off their lives switched off their heads with all your lies
An empire built on million to assholes

Like salt on a deep down wound I despise you

Tore it down it won't get up again
An Empire built on fractured minds collapsing now

I am here to create the end
Wake up this mass of switched off brains
Inject their skull with supreme pain
It's like a sick mass brainwashing machine
Now you'll just taste how it feels to fail

Like salt on a deep down wound I despise you

Tore it down it won't get up again
An Empire built on fractured minds collapsing now

Tore it down it won't get up again
An Empire built on fractured minds collapsing now
