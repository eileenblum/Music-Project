A warm embrace of Mother Eve ablazing passion and grief
The night the stars began to fall I carried away all her sins

Do I dare arise?
Wake from peace
Do you stare my eyes?
I'll walk you down

For you are Cain, for I am the one of disdained
The Eve arose taking me other place
She's taking me down

Could be today the very day I'm gonna question my being
Flesh felt so thin baring virus within for I'm hailing the horror my kin

Do I dare arise?
Join my mortal sin tonight
Do you tore my eyes?
Lightspeed sick bullet of pain

For you are Cain, for I am the one of disdained
The Eve arose taking me other place
She's taking me down
This life oh so black
Fuck me I'm dead

Scorch the earth below the throne
Vision the eve of mourning
Dawn of grieving hail this crippled flesh

For you are Cain, for I am the one of disdained
The Eve arose taking me other place
I am the Cain, the one very king of disdained
The Eve arose taking me other place
Down, to Hell
