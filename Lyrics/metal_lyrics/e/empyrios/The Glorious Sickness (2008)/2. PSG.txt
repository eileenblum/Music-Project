There's no insanity mind the fear, purge it clear
Moment of clarity way far from here
Worst case scene how did we get the fuck up that it is
Nobody knows it fuck this shit

North of hell the Eve Arose
Walking down here she posed the
Sick One he's bearing woe for unforgiven faults hellish coals
Today is something painsick generating from long gone lull

Is there a sanity as the fear purge you clear
Sadistic gravity or filth grinding will
Far from sin manifestationing my will to burn
Sick pain inoculate in yourself

North of hell the Eve Arose
Walking down here she posed the
Sick One he's bearing woe for unforgiven faults hellish coals
Today is something painsick generating from long gone lull

(Once you're down here only the devil can help you, help to meet the supreme pain and be reborn)

Now we're bearing woe for unforgiven faults hellish souls
Today is something painsick generating from fucked up skulls
