Tragedy onto display a nausea eating away sanctity of my dismay
Chained and caged like a chunk of meat on a leash irradiate the mortal flesh

I'm schizophrenic rabid cells of pain eating you inside
I'm havoc vulture bred in supreme chaos

Blinding light so close to, endless wrath adheres to these remnants of my decay
Helpless mind just push you worsening its features, violent frantic display

I'm havoc vulture fed on human failure

Force fed despair within mortal flesh,
I'm Pandemonium
Utter decay enlightening eyes, a fallen catastrophic star

Blinding light won't end soon, endless wrath won't break you, these remnants of my decay
Helpless mind has pushed you, worsened its features, violent goddamn display

I'm schizophrenic rabid cells of pain eating you inside
I'm havoc vulture bred in supreme chaos

Force fed despair within mortal flesh,
I'm Pandemonium
Utter decay enlightening eyes, a fallen catastrophic star

Fell down from hell among human flesh,
I'm Pandemonium
Supreme decay ablazing my eyes, the cataclysmic type supreme kind of pain today
