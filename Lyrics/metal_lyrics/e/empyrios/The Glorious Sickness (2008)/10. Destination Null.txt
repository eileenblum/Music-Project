Black hole shadowgate
Aeon fed

Black hole shadowgate
Aeon fed

Absolute zero summoned man on dark matter lying
All the pain I gave to them
Bound to the endless utter black Reflecting darkness I am
Shed in dark frozen flames - Everlasting sacrifice

Flash of cosmic void clouds of stardust marks my grave
Caressed by veils of smoke stars shall drown in pain

As I came for your deliverance
I am freed cause of your sufferance

On frozen flames and marks of man in eternal slumber fell
Painsick by nature beast generating painfull beings
An aeon coma without end Destination: Null is mine
Awful and mortal beings awakened and finally set free - Everlasting sacrifice

Flash of cosmic void clouds of stardust marks my grave
Caressed by veils of smoke stars shall drown in pain

As I came for your deliverance
I'm the null cause of your sufferance

Flash of cosmic void clouds of stardust marks my grave
Caressed by veils of smoke stars shall drown in pain
