Crushing on boulevard the darkest just has come
A pride in guilt society based on lies and infamy - gouge my eyes

A self made God in hell enthroned on their disgrace
Cannot find how could he has done such atrocities - rip my ears

Marching your parade decadence delight

You're marching on your feet in to this ruin proud of infamy
Another summoned Life in Punishment cause of such parade

I felt just instantly the reek of hidden shame
Cannot understand how you let them take domain - tore my heart

Marching your parade decadence delight

You're marching on your feet in to this ruin proud of infamy
Another summoned Life in Punishment cause of such parade

You're marching on your feet in to this ruin proud of infamy
Another summoned Life in Punishment cause of such parade

You're marching on your feet in to this ruin proud of infamy
Another summoned Life in Punishment cause of such parade
