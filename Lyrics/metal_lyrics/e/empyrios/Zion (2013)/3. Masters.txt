conceived to be mindless and pray
devotion will make me go blind
and brain is just wasting away
how can we rise
get back the right to deny

kneeling, revealing the biggest flaw
breaking away
ripping the string from the sky above
we're leaving today

walking past all the lies
a coming of age
crawling servants arise
leading the way
feel the void
defeat and disobey

reject conception of love
misleading and nurturing hate
to feel pain and beg for some more
keep your head down
don't even try to deplore

sleep tight but keep your eyes open wide
we're breaking away
ripping the string from the sky above
we're leaving today

walking past all the lies
a coming of age
crawling servants arise
leading the way
feel the void
defeat and disobey

watching the scenes unfolding
in shades of gray relieve your pain
sorrow is a desperate warning
for restless souls facing the end

touching, your eyes are swollen
with uncried tears and
scars won't men
calling but your voice got stolen
a toll to wake up
freedom we praise
it's freedom we're getting today

walking past all the lies
a coming of age
crawling servants arise
leading the way
feel the void
defeat and disobey
