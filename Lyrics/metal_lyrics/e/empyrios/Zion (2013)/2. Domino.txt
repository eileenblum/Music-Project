[Manuel Guerrieri]:
call - for help - unfast - the
lightbulb - cower down low
you - know how - fly out - hate
propelled - chasing - fury
molestation - fail - inhale
dumb shout

without forewarning
craving salvation

face the rising domination
you can't deny
it's pushing on you and you alone
as time goes by

[Manuel Guerrieri]:
close - your eyes - you feel - the
pressure - swelling your throat
dazed - amazed - worn out
break - the dam - flood out
all your - desperation
stay - away - far out

with no forewarning
and no foundation
you still

face the rising domination
you can't deny
a flick at a domino well known
recurring damnation
time to face this domination
i'm wondering why
i'm reaching for you
the resolution
to save my life

face the rising domination
you can't deny
it's pushing on you
and you alone
incoming pollution
face the rising domination
you're living a lie
it's all up to you
a self privation
for you might die
