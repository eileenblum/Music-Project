look beyond
the creed and let me
return the lies you stole
you've been struck deadly
now you've got to know

look inside the crib and tell me
is that a hopeless soul ?
he won't lose his grip to let go
human forces defeated

all your beliefs are hollow
meaningless
they're meant to let you down
and right back to square one

i won't let you blame
it on yourself
to be a lonely child
i'm on my way to ease your soul
to come and let you go

[Guillaume Bideau:]
help me out
they're here to get me
'cause they know
you're not alone
we're twisting inside a black hole
human forces defeated

i won't let you blame
blame it on yourself
to be a lonely child

i won't let you blame
it on yourself
to be a lonely child

i won't ever blame it
on myself
you're deep inside my mind
it's just one more way
to ease my soul
i'll never let you go
