i am coming to life
twist the knife
a gushing stream of blood
as deep as you can go
feel it burning
second hand turning
ticking my moments away
now my hands are cold
i'm screaming till you

wake
feel like a strange, yourself
"let me go", trapped in a daydream alone
i'm castaway

i can not just let you cry
you're wasting you last tears
a sad never ending try
bound to fail again

in bed, sore morning
i'm trying to keep it down
i feel inside my head
pressure pushing you

you put your hand over mine
"let me go", echoes in my reverie
every day

i can not just let you cry
you're wasting your last tears
a sad never ending try
bound to fail again

i can not take all the lies
i'm wasting my best years
a therapy long denied now i'm healing

i can not just let
you cry (can't take all the lies)
you're wasting your last tears (no more tears)
a therapy long denied
now you're healing
