maybe it's up to you
to raise a flag, surrender to the climb

the least you can do
stop the wheel of fortune and resign

it's not what you see
when you gaze at future, unaware
you wander in time and cast around
unsealing your fate

fate: blackened page yet to fill not deny
numbly gazing the cage
nerve exposed as you choke
and await for salvation

staring eyes
looking way past tomorrow
there's a story foreseen
madman as you are
playing with fire

back into your room
there must be a reason, a desire
you look for a proof
for your keen despair now, testified

the shame of a man
on his knees, repenting full of sorrow

"so far as my power allows
and your needs require"

need: urge to fill the emptiness within
yet you're idle
torched and ablaze deep in silence
yet you're staring

staring eyes
looking way past tomorrow
there's a story foreseen
madman as you are
playing with fire

close your eyes
you can wait for tomorrow
let the story begin
madman as you were
now rising higher
