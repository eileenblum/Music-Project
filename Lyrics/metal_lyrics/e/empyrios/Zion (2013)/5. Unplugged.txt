i have been the color of the universe, no more
my lids pulled apart gazing nowhere
surrogated being force fed your romance

self-denying will to hear me
embracing noneness
lost in the crowd alone with you

pull the plug
i've been told we've gone astray
that none has been left
perpetual sleep of minds
are we ever gonna wake ?
aday to be unplugged
in blurring lightness i'm chained

pulsing waves desaturated planet earth, stay calm
surrounded by everyone yet i'm no one
every acting clown plays a tragedy

sign of revolution itching
and leave no marking
fate of brand new day
i'm sick of stand by you

pull the plug
pull the plug
eradicate your mind

pull the plug
i've been told we've gone astray
that none has been left
perpetual sleep of minds
are we ever gonna wake ?
a day to be unplugged
are you aware it's today ?
shutting down that light now

"brain signal transmissions terminate"
