why can't we be human ?
we keep talking when there's nothing to say
stitches on my brain
coming away,
coming away

no,
no need no need to know
no, you need to own
no
no need no need to know
no
own !

just before the final roar
there's a louder silence
whispers can be deafening
and a warning

seven billion people ranting
not a single word to deplore
maggots in my brain
rotting away,
rotting away

no
no need no need to know
no, you need to own
no
no need no need to know
no
own !

just before the final roar
there's a louder silence
whispers can be deafening
and a warning
right before the biggest wave
the ocean dries up
just a second too late, too late

just before the final roar
there's a louder silence
whispers can be deafening
and a warning
right before the biggest wave
the ocean dries up
just a second too late, too late
