i'm kept beyond the line
i feel the rising rage
wash away the sorrow
who's to pay ?

there's a perfect scheme
i'm going through
a plan to bear you down
i'm coming for you now
a taste for revenge

in low tide dreads are cast aside
you know it's a bait but somehow
you strive to have a taste and chew
and you won't regret
yet you know you're dead

and you said you never ever
give up till you're done
then you want some more, still more
all the things you hate, all the things you hide
they will hunt you down

i step across the line
and turn another page
there's nothing i can fear now
not a thing

it's a flight or fly position
i'm aching to get out of
just with my bare hands
aiming to the core

in high tide waves are rushing in
i guess they just take you by storm
and every little thing you do
trying to stay afloat
will just drag you down

and you said you never ever
give up till you're done
then you want some more, still more
all the things you hate,
all the things you hide
you will face them all

and you said you never ever
give up till you're done
then you want some more, still more
all the things you hate, all the things you hide
they will hunt you down

clocks are ticking
my countdown
moments multiply
as i count them all
maybe, if i lie and float
let the tide take over me
