you have no control
over the lies that you tell
and you borrow a new face
for every chance you take

they ask you not to be
and you won't back down
raging against the flood
let your ego drown

driving down renovation road
empty vehicles
drift in undertow
final call
for a moral makeover
all defeat outrun
to seize the day
revived

let your life unfold
bursting the mask apart
just like fire from a spark
burn all your sins away

they ask you not to be
and you won't back down
raging against the flood
let your ego drown

driving down renovation road
empty vehicles
drift in undertow
final call
for a moral makeover
all defeat outrun
to seize the day
revived

faded sorrow
living out of bounds
reach tomorrow
and feel alive

driving down renovation road
empty vehicles
drift in undertow
final call
for a moral makeover
all defeat outrun
to seize the day
revived
