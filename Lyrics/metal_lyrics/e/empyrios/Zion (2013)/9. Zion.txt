drawing to an end evolution backward
greatest worlds traveling apart
gathering the emptiness of nothing
we're sailing to a past now coming undone

shelter of pure decay

back to the same
primal Zion (future nowhere in sight)
back to where we cam
death and hunger (still the same)
shades of gray

golden birds of prey spinning on your deadlock
every step's one closer to dismay
wide awake and screaming from your own grave
you half the truth, unveil the secrets of time

shelter of hope shelter of life
no leap of faith

back to the same
primal Zion (future nowhere in sight)
back to where we came
death and hunger (still the same)
shades of gray

cracks on the walls, ceiling falling down
blinded by the space around us
bleeding away primordial
utopia embraced

back to where we came
nowhere to be found
(unbroken coil of life)
still we crave and
pray
for a savior
