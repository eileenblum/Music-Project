a boy that grew up stubborn, yet deplorable
neurasthenic he made the flesh creep
sharper than blade

you despise what
i can read

crawling through the minds, an unattractive guy
outrage, fear and disgust
blended him as he fed on the dread

on your terror i
feast in delight

wormhole domain
greatest offender
there's no cabal
he's feeding on you all

locked tight in his dungeon, suddenly felt the sting
of danger, nightfalling doomsday
closer and deadly

for i am not
first of my kind

wormhole domain
greatest offender
there's no cabal
he's feeding on you all

wormhole domain, haunted by danger
facing assault alone, on his own

wormhole domain
greatest offender
there's no cabal
feeds on you all
