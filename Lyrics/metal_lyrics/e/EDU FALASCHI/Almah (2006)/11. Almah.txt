[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Cells of a chemical trance
Flow by the endless river ways
Bringing seeds of time
Memories of cold winter days
Sleep through the screams of wind of change
Erasing bleeding scars

New ways
A new start
Unreal time
Reminds...
You! You! You! That

Life is like a rainy day
That comes to hide the sunshine
Always it back again

Lonely you fly by the space
And you know the thorn of wailing ages
It's the journey of life
Into the treasure of faith
You find the holy secret keys
And open hidden doors

New ways
A new start
Unreal time
Reminds...
You! You! You! That

Life is like a rainy day
That comes to hide the sunshine
Always it back again

Reaching the field of wealth
I leave all my shadows behind
I keep on singing I set free
The sins I've been sowing inside
