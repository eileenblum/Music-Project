[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Stand back and take your time to rely on
You again, feel the beat of the heart
See the signs and be the stray for the first time
Face to face with the evil eyes you just fade away and die
You knew the hell, you feel the flames burning inside

The ways of the states of mind
Can open the gates

Straight to the scary zone
Straight to the scary zone
Land of evil or divine?
Scary Zone
Gate of the scary zone
Disguise

Something insane,
an atomic fear,
Grab you and tear you
sane world dawn
A shaded wish shows far away
An unknown ray of light

The ways of the states of mind
Can open gates

Straight to the scary zone
Straight to the scary zone
Land of evil or divine?
Scary Zone
Gate of the scary zone
Will drive
Will drive your insane
So shake off the chains
And keep on the way
It's your time to scape

[Solos]

Straight to the scary zone
Straight to the scary zone
Land of evil or divine?
Scary Zone
Gate of the scary zone
Inside
Scary zone
Straight to the scary zone
Straight to the scary zone
Land of evil or divine?
Scary Zone
Gate of the scary zone
Will drive...
Will drive your insane
So shake off the chains
And keep on the way
It's your time to scape.
