[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Life has always been there
You can try to hide
But it's everywhere

The color of roses
The shine of sunrise
The strength of the waves
The tears in your eyes

The rage of the storm
The smile of a child
The river that flows
The birds in the sky

It all lives deep inside you
Spinning so fast
It's out of control
It screams in your chest
It screams in your chest

The hands of a friend
The trees in the park
A yellow portrait

A bleeding old heart
A cold rainy day
The beauty of the stars
A cruel hurricane

It all lives deep inside you
Spinning so fast
It's out of control
It screams in your chest
Your colorful soul
Now adorns the space
That before was dark
And now you can see
So now you can breathe
Now you can breathe
Breathe
