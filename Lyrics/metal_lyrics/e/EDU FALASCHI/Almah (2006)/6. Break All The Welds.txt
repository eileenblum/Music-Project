[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Changes are coming so fast
As a flash all this freedom is shaking your life
Blinded by fire and shadows of legacy of fear

Cold sword of wisdom cuts the crime of
Deprivation of sight

People are captive since they were born
In the chains of all innocent lies
Diving and sinking in a mud sea
where they can't breathe

Cold sword of wisdom cuts the crime of

Deprivation of sight
Thoughts are free as the wind
You just should spread them
You just should break all the welds

They want to control your mind
They want to sew your eyes
They steal your resting mind

Oh! Deprivation of sight
Thoughts are free as the wind
Shout loud! Stand up and cry
Thoughts are free as the wind
You just should spread them
You just should feed them
You just should break all the welds
