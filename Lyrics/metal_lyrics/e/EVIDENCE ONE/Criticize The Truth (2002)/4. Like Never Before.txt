Inside my head, Inside my soul 
Something returned, Out of control

Feels like I'm lost in my own illusions
Day after day after day 
Can't hide this feeling of manic confusion

[CHORUS:]
Calling on the world, I can't take it back
All I've ever done,
(Was) based on my good intensions
Calling on to you, please don't close the door
This time it's real, just Like Never Before!

Inside my head,  Making me sweat 
Making me feel I will never forget

For the first I will beg for forgiveness
Time after time after time 
Don't leave me stranded, stranded and helpless

[CHORUS]

Love, don't push me away,
Don't leave me bleeding
Love, this time I'll stay
I won't be cheatin

[CHORUS X2]

Like Never Before!
