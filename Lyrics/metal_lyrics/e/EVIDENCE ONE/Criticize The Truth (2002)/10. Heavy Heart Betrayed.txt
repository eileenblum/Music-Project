How I wish from my life
To be reborn again
No more bleeding, this life
Is about to end

Cruisin'  round a rainy night 
Hard to keep the storm outside
I lie awake a stormy night 
I'm not allowed to touch the light

Feel the rain is pouring 
For only I can hide the truth

[CHORUS:]
My Heavy Heart betrayed 
No more lies at midnight 
I'm just a victim of fate
Feel I'm losing this fight 
Heavy - yeah, Heavy Heart Betrayed

I am drowned in this dream
Within the shadows of my soul
Following a cold stream
Just about to loose control

Cruisin' round a rainy night 
Hard to keep the storm outside

I lie awake a stormy night 
I'm not allowed to touch the light

Feel the rain is pouring 
For I can t hide the truth

[CHORUS]

My Heavy Heart Betrayed
No more lies at midnight
I'm just a victim of fate
Feel I m losing this light
My Heavy Heart Betrayed
No more lies at midnight
I'm just a victim of fate
Feel I m losing this fight
Heavy - yeah, Heavy Heart Betrayed

Info:

The story of EVIDENCE ONE starts in early 2001, when DOMAIN vocalist Carsten "Lizard" Schulz and AOR HEAVEN boss Georg Siegl hook up at a KANSAS show in Munich. When Georg tells Carsten about his plans of releasing a solo album of FRONTLINE mastermind Robby Boebel, the singer, as a long-time FRONTLINE fan, immediately catches fire and a couple months later, while DOMAIN and SHAKRA are touring Germany on their Melodic Return tour, he gets to hear the first couple instrumental demo songs. To make a long story short, in late November 2001 Boebel and Schulz start writing material for this solo album. The collaboration becomes amazingly productive: At their first meeting they write their first two killer tracks and even manage record all guitar and vocal parts in two days. Both musicians soon realize that this is more than just a solo project. They decide to form a new band, and as quick as the songwriting emerges, they have together their new band, named EVIDENCE ONE.

Originally ment to play the bass parts on his solo album, they ask Robby's FRONTLINE band mate Thomas "Hutch" Bauer to join in, and quickly find the perfect match to complete the line up with SHAKRA powerhouse drummer Roger Tanner, who Carsten knew from their co-headlining tour.

Within only a few sessions at his own studio Robby Boebel produces an album with EVIDENCE ONE, which can definetely be called one of the Melodic Rock hightlights of the last years. No matter, if it's Hard Rock headbangers like the title track "Criticize The Truth" or the cool "In The Beginning There Was Fire", epic, but melodic tracks like "Trust Vs. Heart" or "Fool's Gold", or even solo guitar-driven blasters as "Like Never Before", it almost seems, like the guys have naturally been producing and playing together for years.
