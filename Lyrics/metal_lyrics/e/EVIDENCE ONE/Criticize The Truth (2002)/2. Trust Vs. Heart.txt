Day after day, a sunset away, the sunshine 
In your eyes, your empty eyes

All I know, all I had

Night after night, the hours we spent, the laughter 
And the tears, your frozen tears

Day after day, a sunset away, the sunshine 
In your eyes, your empty eyes

Night after night, the hours we spent, the laughter 
And the tears, your frozen tears
All I know, it's all I had

[CHORUS:]
Trust Vs. Heart 
I will belong to your dreams
Trust Vs. Heart 
Forever the ghost in your dreams

Lie after lie, my mind locked away from the feelings 
Deep inside, I try to hide

All I know, all I had 

[CHORUS]

Now I run from this pain
It's a lonely, lonely ride
Never trust you again
Forever the ghost in your dreams

[CHORUS]

Trust - I will belong to your dreams
Trust - forever the ghost in your dreams
Trust, Trust
