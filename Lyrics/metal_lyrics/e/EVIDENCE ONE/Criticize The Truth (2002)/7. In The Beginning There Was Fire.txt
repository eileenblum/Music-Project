Once I was lost inside your eyes
Now I'm lost within myself
I saw the truth in all your lies
But you left me hanging, hanging by a thread

No more the fool inside 
Who's countin' the minutes at midnight

In The Beginning There Was Fire
Burning for a long time
Just like loveletters from a liar
Baby, you're walkin' on a thin line
I tried so hard to understand
Baby, I tried so hard to be your man
This bursting dream I can't forget
You left me hanging, hanging by a thread - yeah!

No more the fool inside 
Who's countin' the minutes at midnight

In The Beginning There Was Fire
Burning for a long time
lust like loveletters from a liar
Baby, you're walkin' on a thin line
In The Beginning There Was Fire
Burning for a long time
Just like loveletters from a liar
Baby, you're walkin' on a thin line
In The Beginning There Was Fire
Burning for a long time
lust like loveletters from a liar
Baby, you're walkin' on a thin line
In The Beginning There Was Fire -
Burning for a long time
lust like loveletters from a liar -
Baby, you're walkin' on a thin line
