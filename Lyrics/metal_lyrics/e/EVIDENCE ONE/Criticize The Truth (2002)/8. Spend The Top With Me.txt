Since the first day, we're together, 
You are the answer to my every prayer
Wanna share my fears forever 
To make you be the one, who's always there

Come on - paradise is on its way 
No more - lonely nights

[CHORUS:]
Hold on to what once missin'
Though I can give no guarantee
I know what we both believe in
Come on Spend The Top With Me

For first time in my life
I found what I was looking for
I see the future when I look in your eyes
Don't wanna lose this feeling no more

Welcome -  heaven is on the rise 
Hard times - forever gone, forever gone

[CHORUS]

I'll be there baby, hold on This I swear, Forever one

[CHORUS x2]

Come on Spend The Top With Me 
Come on Spend The Top With Me
