Time to face what's going on 
Time to face the hurting truth
it's so easy to close your eyes 
It's so easy to lie to you

Don't you see, the times they changed 
Think again

Live your dreams again
Time to Criticize The Truth
Keep from what might have been
Time to Criticize The Truth

Hard to tell the wrong from right 
Not to fall for the other side

Life can cheat you so many times 
But you gotta stay strong, strong inside

Don't you see, what might have changed 
Don't be afraid

Live your dreams again
Time to Criticize The Truth
Keep from what might have been
Time to Criticize The Truth
Live your dreams again
Time to Criticize The Truth
Keep from what might have been
Time to Criticize The Truth
Live your dreams again
Time to Criticize The Truth
Keep from what might have been
Time to Criticize The Truth
Start a new dream Start a new dream
