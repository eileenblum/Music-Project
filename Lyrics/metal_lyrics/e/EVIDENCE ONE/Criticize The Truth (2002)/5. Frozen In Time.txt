Living is easy as long as you're loved
Time is the healer of all that once was
Hard to believe that there's love in my heart
Where is the healer, now that you're gone

Heart cries for mercy 
My heart cries for you (to return)

Lost in a sea of tears - Land of a thousand fears 
All of my words don't rhyme

[CHORUS:]
Lost in a sea of tears - Land of a thousand fears 
All of my words don't rhyme 
Seems like I'm Frozen In Time

Where do I belong to, what can i do?
When all of living was built around you
Reaching for freedom, longing for peace
I promised myself, what my heart never keeps

Long lost inside me 
This feeling I just can't pretend
