I've been drinkin' too much
been smokin' too much, too
but this red wine feels alright,
feels alright even without you

You said, our love was perfect
I didn't do no wrongs
I know that it's all worth it
But I never thought, I had to be this strong

Have we been talkin' too much?
Did I never say the words'
Still the touch of your hand
Paralizes and hurts

Stranded on Different Worlds
Living in Different Times    
Living in Different Worlds - living in Different...

I should have been more patient
I should have been more kind
You always seemed to show me
Everything feels alright

Maybe, you've had your doubts
Maybe, it's all in your head
I won't take back what I did,
And I won't take back all the things I said

I thought that our love was worth it
worth every fuzz and fight
I thought we'd stay together
Now I see, our love was way outta sight

Stranded on Different Worlds 
Living in Different Times 
Living in Different Worlds 
Living in Different Times

[REPEAT]

Stranded on Different Worlds 
Living in Different Worlds 
Living in Different Times
Stranded on Different Worlds 
Living in Different Times 
Living in Different Worlds 
Living in Different Times
