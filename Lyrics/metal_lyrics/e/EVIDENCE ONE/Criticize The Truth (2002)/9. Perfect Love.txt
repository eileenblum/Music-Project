It's been too long, too long apart 
My heart cries out in rage

I'm drowning deep within myself 
From all the tears I cried
Don't wanna go on - hide &amp; seek 
Don't wanna feel this forever

[CHORUS:]
You &amp; I can't hide our feelings
You &amp; I all alone
Why can't I trust this feeling
Trust in this Perfect Love

True love can mend, can only heal 
What once was madly broken

Let's start again, built up again 
No more harsh words spoken
Don't wanna go on - hide &amp; seek 
Don't wanna feel this never
Can't trust this Perfect Love 
Can't trust this Perfect Love

[CHORUS]

Perfect Love
