Foaming Ocean
Endless Horizon
Astir in the light of the dawn

I woke up lost
On a shimmering shoreline
Not where I'd laid my head at night
At the end of the road
Never lies another day to be astray

How did I end up in here out of nowhere?
No sign of the dark, no recall
A distinct feel of being home
Arose with the morning sun
Why wouldn't I stay if I feel I belong?

On a journey worth a lifetime abroad

By the wavy sea
Misty roads are behind me
A sublime privilege to be
On these shores of liberty

But one more time I turned to see
The world I have left behind me
Without words staring aghast
The smoke rising behind the vast
