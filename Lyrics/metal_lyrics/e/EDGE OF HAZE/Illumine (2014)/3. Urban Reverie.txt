What is in the air?
Is it our submission?
Visualize the world
By all the things you've heard

Let us go
Let us go to another day
Let the sun
Let the sun light our day
Continuous run

Let me go
Let me go
Another day
Let the moon
Let the moon guide my way
Away

It began to feel like this city is just a bunch of lies
And these people are not what I want
Over the hills
To the landscape of my soul

Let me go
Let me go today
Let this dream
Let this dream be my guide
I've visualized
