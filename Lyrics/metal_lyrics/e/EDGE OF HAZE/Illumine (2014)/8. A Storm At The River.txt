A storm
There's a storm at the river
I gaze at it from afar
Its rumble awakened me

A shadow in my mind
was something I left behind
The misty miles of mine
I roamed

I took a step in the dark
Beside your ghost
Into the night
Watching the storm
Thundering over the land
Feel my insignificance
Just a grain of sand
