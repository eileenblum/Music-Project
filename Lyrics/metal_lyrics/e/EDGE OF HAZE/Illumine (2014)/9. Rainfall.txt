As I faced the opening grove anew
I decided to halt for the time was due
Dusk soon covered the darkening world
Replacing the light with the colours of the night

Reality descends as the skies rain on me
I'm drenched by the heavens' pouring black sea
Trying to snuggle within the warmth inside
But the coldness of the world devours me
Into its custody

Forlorn are the lights on the way...
The deep blue shades of rain
In the lonely hours' domain
Colour the scenery
With paints of darkening tone
I tried to mute the noise of the world
As I felt it was too loud for a captive of the crowd
But even here I can't help but feel the weakness of my state
A lonely path to tread with no destination ahead

Time is just a notion hiding its worth
I'm counting the hours by the hum of the earth
Few are the thoughts without any pain
Drowning to sleep to the deep shades of rain
Into its custody

Forlorn are the lights on the way...
Forlorn lights slumber

The shades of the rain dye the view in blue
The shades of the rain drown the lights to sleep
