Within these walls their lies abide
Dreams are denied
Our will remains unheard
We are all meant to be the same
Imitators of the archetype
Unaware of better life

Blackened is the way out
Blackened is the way out

Drawn into endless night
Drawn into the open pyre of light
Into the open sea
Drawn unwillingly

A broken line of notion
Overshadowing the days
A one-way avail
In the emptiness of senseâ¨we are drawn into the fraudâ¨Within the power grids

We are all meant to be
Imitators of the archetype
Imitating time and again
Within these walls their lies abide
Dreams are denied

Blackened is the way out
Blackened is the way out
Blackened is the way
