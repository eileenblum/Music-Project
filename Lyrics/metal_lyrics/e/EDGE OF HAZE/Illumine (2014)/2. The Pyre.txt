Smoldering grass
Noxious fumes
Smoke smothers the city

Trying to hold my breath
The vapor hurts in the lungs
Exhaling causes vertigo

At the scenery of the end of days
I stare at the haunt of oblivion
Vacant spheres filled with smoke
Buildings burn as far I can see

I run forth behind thought

Rush and run
The city is burning down
and absolutely nothing is left
I watch this play of agony
Incapable to play my role

The echoing walls inhale
The smoke-stained stench of our grave
Within the pyre we become undone

"The towers ablaze
As the circle completes
The days had a limit
Ignite the barren souls
Before they comprehend
The pyre burns tonight

A force overwhelming
Crushes the cattle
There was no warning
As the drug deafens
Before it fades
The plot comes to its end"

The daze lapsed in my head
A withering while
Realization of concealing

At the scenery of the end of days
I stared at the haunt of oblivion
Now I am awake watching outside
It is grey
As grey as it used to be

In the dream my city was burning down
and absolutely nothing was left
I watched this play of agony
In the dream
