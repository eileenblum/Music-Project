Rusty and grey, lights decay
Derelict houses are rampant
Smog covers the air as a pall
Stagnation in front of us all

Atmosphere of fear
Visibly subordinate mass
No resistance at all
Just people obeying their call

Notably vague vision
In the eyes of the folk
Was I the same before
the realization

Praise reign
Woe as our mandatory load
Leads into alienation
The barren souls are crushed into the ground
Their dreams were never true

Atmosphere of fear
Visibly subordinate mass
Constantly observed area
I must flee from here

Rusty and grey is the new day
In the eyes of the folk
Was I the same before
A travesty of man

Our dreams were never true
They were never true
