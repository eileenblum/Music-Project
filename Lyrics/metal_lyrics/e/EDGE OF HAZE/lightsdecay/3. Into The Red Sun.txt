I made my choice
I could not stay
At the red sun's dawn
I'm on my way
Creeping the silent streets
Watching out not to tread
In the revealing red

Through the morning haze
Searching my way out of this maze
The shimmer is not so gray
Behind this alleyway

I am out

The day I thought I'd never see
My veins are filled with liberty
I pierce the system of greed
Redeem my pain with this deed
Sensations arising from novelty

The steel transforming into lea
The menacing shadow throbs internally
Away from oppression
Leap into the wild

Cut loose
Onward
Off benighted sleep

Cut loose
Onward
Off living benighted

Mountains loom
Spreading across my eyes
I can see the red sun rise
