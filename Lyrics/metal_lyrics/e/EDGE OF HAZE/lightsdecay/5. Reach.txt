I kept my eyes peeled on a loophole
Used the chance I had and got through
In the outer side of a broken past
Sensing the freedom at last
An upbeat outcast

Skies are illumined
Decaying lights are just a relic of the bygone times
This newfound mindset allows me to be
Beyond the system that restrained me

I reach to reclaim the view I had
Lost it in the pressure couldn't stay intact
But now my eyes are open wide to see
The light in redemption

Right there right before my eyes
The shimmering periphery to freedom lies
And now my eyes are open wide to see
The light in redemption

I'm loose from the fading lifelines
Building solely on my needs
But I made a choice to be
destined into uncertainty

What if they find you when
you're weak alone unwell
Are you willing to cross the line?

Your lifelines will be few
As forsaken all you knew
For the sake of your notion

See the light
A border to freedom

What if they find me when
I'm weak alone unwell
Am I willing to cross the line?

After taking this step
Which I soon might regret
There is no going back
