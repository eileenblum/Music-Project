No restrictions
Unmade roads leading nowhere
That's what I want
To break the shackles and forget them
No one around to tell me where I belong
This independence is making me stronger

A sea of trees
Surrounds me

Gone for good
Building up my sanity
By unlearning
Renewed for good
Learning to live
By unlearning

Resurrected from absence
Reborn on the run
Arisen from the mist
Cherished by the sun
How can a single thought of bliss
Redeem my time in the abyss

Resurrected from absence
Reborn on the run
Arisen from the mist of fear-saturated sun
How can a single deed
Give me all I need

Unlearning to give my life away
