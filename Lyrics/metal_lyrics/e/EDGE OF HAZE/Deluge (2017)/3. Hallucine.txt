Aspiration I ignore
Isnât it clear life was something it is no more?

Answers like I did before
Itâll all be like I wanted or not

Now when Iâm off Iâm drifting
My senses are numb and shifting
Visions everywhere as Iâm leaving

And if Iâm dreaming
Donât wake me up just yet
And if you feel it
Donât take it as a threat

And if you see it
Donât close your eyes, youâre mine
âCause if Iâm dreaming
Donât you wake me up this time

Destination still obscure
Isnât it here or should I be away?

So I call
For stories Iâm not even sure
Happen in these kind of places
Oh well

And when Iâm off Iâm drifting
It suddenly feels uplifting
Visions everywhere and again
Hallucinate I am there

And if Iâm dreamingâ¦

âCause itâs a fight against it all
It doesnât feel like committing resistance
And itâs a fight until the fall
Doesnât feel Iâm covering any distance

Iâm giving up hope
Iâm withering down
Doesnât even feel like Iâm making a difference
Iâm ready to break free
Iâm ready to lose myself tonight

Now letting go
Cascading
My senses are numb
Iâm fading

A memory - A melody
Iâm letting your song be my remedy
Visions everywhere
Again and again and again
