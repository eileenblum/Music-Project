No more on my own
The mist will guide you home

Running away
I'm running away from the dissonance
Which I once felt related with

Wanted to be
I wanted to be someone else
After so many years my mind rebels

Needed to be
I needed to be something else
Than a figure casted into a shape

As I wanted to know
How far I could go on my own
Without having to bow to anyone

So let me go
âCause I have a burden to undo
Let me cede my weight to you

So let me go
And close the curtain you see
This place was not ever meant for me

No more on my own
For the tidal waves keep rising on
And drown my voice
When they'll tower above my freedom

The mist will guide you home
If you ever choose to follow me
To join in this complicity of ours
Let me go

I wish to be free
From the moments that live inside my head
I wish to be free

I wish to be free
So I'd see tomorrow arise again
I wish to be free

I wish to be free
From these shackles that bind me
I wish to be free
I wish to be free
