In a moment you became
So unlike anything
When I opened up my heart
To dependence

I used to be a simple soul
Untouched I was whole
In a moment it all was changed
By the pretense

I sow a seed
Under this soil
And let it grow
To unfold

The soothing rain
Under this sky
The inception for
Thoughts that fly high

Ever since I let you in
There's been imbalance deep within
I've been at variance with my cause
and true intentions

It's come the time to make a choice
And listen to the inner voice
Get loose of the doubt for tomorrow
And give in to the flow to take you away

I sow a seedâ¦
Into a fair memory of this day

Let your wings unfold
Hear the thoughts untold

Beyond the verge
Beyond the verge
I skydive
