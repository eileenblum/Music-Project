We are
Bystanders at the water
Two different worlds that are confronting each other

We are
Not meant to play the same song
When I'm the one arranging words to an order

Cast us
To face the looming surface
We go under - shatter - sunder - scatter

You are
Revealing to be just another echo of the past
That I'm trying to hold off

One of us won't see tomorrow
One of us will greet the morning sun
And even after all you gave me

One of us will keep on falling
Do you even know which one you are?

Hold me until we hit the water

We are
Stuck in the same recurrence
I should forget you as you're no longer my future

Somehow
The turning of the tides
Has seen me trying and trying but still in the end

One of usâ¦

On the verge of steepness
Over raging surges
Weâre casted back to the deep

See the morning breaking
Once again separating
Itâs time for us to part

We are
Bystanders at the water
Two different worlds that are confronting each other
Somehow this pattern goes on and on

One of usâ¦

Do you even know you haunt me?
Do you even know you've gone so far?
And even after all you gave me

One of us will keep on falling
Do you even know itâs what you are?
Itâs what you are
