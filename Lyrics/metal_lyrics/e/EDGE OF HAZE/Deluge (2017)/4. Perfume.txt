The only time that you made me think
If it really was a play or a part of something
Was when I walked into that room

This cage was locked all along
If I disengage will you prove I'm not wrong?

I've searched through the darkest of corners
Only to find the slightest of lights
One breath and the memory of her ignites

All in that vivid odour
Lone recollection left untold

The story begins to unfold

The only time that you made me think
If I'm really just a prey or a part of something
Show me if there is something more

An ardour - for an answer
A secret - set to bloom

And after so many times
I have told myself to stay out
Said I would never go down
I am past the chance to bail out

And after so many times
You have lured me into this loop
Said I would never get up again
Youâve made me succumb again

My cage shall tear down its walls
The aroma stays but the scenery falls

Iâve searched through the wrong kind of darkness
Only to find the truth has two sides
One breath and the vision of her collides

So many timesâ¦

Iâve fallen for something I can't defy
I should have perceived that perfumeâs a lie

I must spray more
My head gets sore
The picture gets clearer
It's how this began

I can't ignore
Just like before
I've done this the same way all over again
You're a drug

So many timesâ¦

An ardour - for the freedom
The light was a person I could not exhume

A secret - set to bloom
The answer I searched for was made out of fume
