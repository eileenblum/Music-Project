The end began so suddenly
I was numb for misery
Disease blighted my freedom

Everyday I gaze same dot
What I've done or what I've not
My head is full of thoughts and pain

Being upset everyday is agony
I repay the price of my casual life

Finally I realize
How brief my life was
If I'd vanish today

Avoiding the truth, refusing the facts
I know that I'll die with certainty
Every time I close my eyes I fall within the silence
I'm afraid of my passing

Silence
