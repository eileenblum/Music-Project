Life ain't always easy
You can never be sure
There are too many diseases
That do not have a cure
Be ready for tomorrow
From clear sky it may rain
I think that I belong here
Where the truth is in vain

This is the countdown to the war
Wrong kind of rebound to us all
Your deeds just became undone
In the place where I belong

Lie more, you are higher
There will be blood and sorrow
Lets pick up the berries when they're ripe
Practice of tomorrow

This is the countdown to the war
Wrong kind of rebound to us all
Your deeds just became undone
In the place where I belong
