Somehow
I always knew I wouldnât be myself
I know I let you down
But someone inside me felt so scared

And I saw your pain and all the marks they left along your face
They said itâs part of the game
So on your nightmares stayed the same

Through all the times they made you fear
I pretended it was not my deal
I wanna say Iâm sorry
I didnât help you out

Sometimes it all seems hopeless
But if we stand against it
the tears have chance to dry
And no, itâs never easy
But the bruises fade away, donât they?
