We thought that we could live like this
Waste resources and create crises
Only the strongest survive
The billow of frostbites

Collecting the remains of our culture
Suffering from the cost of our greed
Why does our every try
End up in agony

As the witnesses of collapsing world
We should see our weakness
Why does our every try
End in this destiny

We have only proceeded backwards
From the culmination of mankind
Once we had a chance to live
No one did remind

Eclipse

Thoughts in the past
We assumed that it would always last
We breathe in the frost now
Shrouded by the haze of the end
