One day I began to sense tremor
Now I don't know when I'm awake
Life is only blurred disturbance
I would like to open my eyes but I can't

Inside me grows a new kind of distress
When I realize that all this is true
I don't know when I slept last time
Or when I was conscious, have I ever been?

Am I alive?
Am I here?

I have no protection, sometimes I don't know
If I'm breathing or not
Over pounding darkness
I need to consolidate myself inside

Darkness deprives my mind
Senses fall behind
Ominous noises turn to truth in my head
My throat suffocates so I can't take a breath

The corrosion of my mind is ruining me
A sudden change with no reason
I'm uncertain of my existence
That consumes me from within
