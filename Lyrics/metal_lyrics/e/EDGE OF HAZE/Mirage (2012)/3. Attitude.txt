You were young when I found you
You were scared too
Do I really need these eyes
to show the scars in you?

You were so suffocated
and amputee
How cruel this wicked life can be?

Close your eyes
Cradle yourself to disguise
Close your eyes
Your attitude helps you to rise

You had an obsession
To live like hound
I saw your siblings
The bodies on the ground

I came with true salvation
To pick you up from hell
I saw it just in place you dwell
I did
