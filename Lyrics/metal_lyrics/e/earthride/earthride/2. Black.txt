Was a cold dark night the ï¿½witches hour
Around the fire, with the cross turned down
I was looking for something to do
Didnï¿½t know what I was getting into

[Chorus:]
Complex rituals unknown to man
Souls held by ungodly hands
Black jackal on earth again
As few pray he doesnï¿½t take revenge

Magic charms with the taste for sin
Wicked spectrums man kinds end
Deceiving the universe the time has come
For the children of the unholy one

[Chorus]

The human race canï¿½t take the pain
Darkness waits on whatï¿½s to come again
Signs of evil damnations dawn
Signs of life have now all gone

[Chorus]

Open my eyes to a nightmare it seems
Just to realize it was all a dream
Open my eyes to a nightmare it seems
Just to realize it was all a dream

[Chorus]
