The stress has started and it wonï¿½t end
The waves of madness come pouring end

[Chorus:]
Do you think that I care?
When the hammer comes down
You must be mistaken me
For some kind of clown

Sick of being alive frustration sets in
Pain and depression is his only friend

[Chorus]

Doomed vision forever death is in your eyes
The bullets your master when will you realize

Doomed future forever death is in your eyes
The bullets your disaster when will you realize

With a bullet
With a bullet yeah

Pull the trigger if thatï¿½s what you think
It wonï¿½t mean nothing to me that your fucking weak

[Chorus]

Doomed vision forever death is in your eyes
The bullets your master when will you realize

Doomed future forever death is in your eyes
The bullets your disaster when will you realize

With a bullet
With a bullet ....oh yeah, yeah

The stress has started and it wonï¿½t end
The waves of madness come pouring in
