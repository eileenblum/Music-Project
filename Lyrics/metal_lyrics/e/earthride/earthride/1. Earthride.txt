Pistons grinding, Shining chrome
In this road, the only thing I know
Blood is boiling, Iï¿½m all alone
Must get back, to find my home

[Chorus:]
So loud, so alive
All heavy, the earthride

Movinï¿½ faster, breakneck speed
To the limit, metal steed
RPM reading ten, past the point of certain end

[Chorus]

Feel the breeze of a life time
The wind is whipping back your hair
Your soul it yearns for excitement
There are thirteen ways your gonnaï¿½ get there

[Chorus]

Iron horse of mercy, Hold my soul so bright
Moto breath stallion, Carry me through the night

[Chorus]

Feel the breeze of a life time
The wind is whipping back your hair 
Your soul it burns for excitement
There are thirteen ways your gonna get there

[Chorus]

Pistons grinding, shining chrome
In this road, the only thing I know
Blood is boiling, Iï¿½m all alone
Must get back, to find my home
