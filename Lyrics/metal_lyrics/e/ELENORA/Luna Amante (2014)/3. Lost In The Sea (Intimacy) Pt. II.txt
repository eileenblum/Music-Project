This is my fate
This is the sea
This is where I want to be for the rest of my life
Treading unknown waters as the waves crash in my face
The tides pull me under
The surface is so far away
I feel a presence beneath me
Seems as if someone is watching over me
With knowing what lies ahead I hold my breath and close my eyes
I can hear her singing
If you want, I can take you to the bottom of the sea
(Without a submarine) the sea (you can live like me)
If you want I can teach you how to breathe like me
How to breathe like me, like me.
She's singing underwater to the tune of my despair
Loneliness is all sheâs ever known
And itâs got her ensnared
The melody drowns my sorrows as the current pulls me in
Can you hear me singing?
Can you hear me up here? Iâm singing along
Iâd die trying to reach you
because itâs where I belong
Under the sea
