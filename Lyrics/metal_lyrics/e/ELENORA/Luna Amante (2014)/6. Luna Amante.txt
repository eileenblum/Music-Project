Looking back at earth from a million miles away
You know youâll see me again, again someday
But for now just stare at my constellation
Canât you see me burning beyond the atmosphere?
Donât you feel me yearning? I just wish you were here
Hurry up and do what it takes, I feel like Iâm losing faith
I wonât rest till you decide
Go and leave it all behind--the family you hate and lies you were told to abide
Can I convince you that theyâre not going to miss you like I do
Like I do
When the stars align in the future and our zodiac signs are one
We can get married in space, without the human race discouraging what weâve done
Iâm drifting away into space
Itâs been 20 years since Iâve seen your face, and Iâve come to understand nothing at all
I donât know where I am, but Iâm sure that where I am is paradise
Looking back at earth
From a million miles away
You know that youâll see me again, again someday
But for now just stay away
