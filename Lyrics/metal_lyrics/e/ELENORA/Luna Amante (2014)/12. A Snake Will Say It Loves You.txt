Anxiety seeps out of my pores; insomnia takes over
(Can someone please clean the blood in my veins?)
Temptation lies within these walls; thereâs no exit, I am confined
No matter how far I run, I canât escape
I am broken; Iâve tried to forget what Iâve lost without all these drugs
But I need them by my side to get through the night--I canât do this on my own.
Iâm so gone--youâre all the same
Distinguish my arms and not my name
Iâm sharpening the only thing that brings me hope
Reopening the scars--I donât want them to heal
Where has all my medicine gone? My medicine gone? My medicine gone?
(I donât want to feel anymore, where is my antidote?)
Iâm slowly dying and thereâs nothing you can do to bring me back
Bring me back! Bring me back!
(From this intoxicating nightmare)
And Iâm hypnotizing anyone that tries to keep me from this drug
From this drug! From this drug!
(So they know Iâm the victim not the cause)
Society sleeps while Iâm awake in a cold sweat; my bones ache
Ignoring the signs, Iâm out of time
I have nothing left!
This addiction has gone too far I canât be saved.
I get the feeling Iâll never be satisfied
What will it take to just be happy again?
When everythingâs perfect is it really worth it to come down from this high?
Should I sell my soul or make amends?
Should I try to be something that I'm not, and remember all the faith that I forgot?
