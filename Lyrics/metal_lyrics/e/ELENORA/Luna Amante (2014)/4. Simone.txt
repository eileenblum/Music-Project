Open your eyes baby--you don't see how good I am to you.
You know what Iâd do for you is crazy--letâs stay together.
Darling Iâll find a way
Because after everything you put me through, my god Iâm still in love with you.
Baby, I've been thinking of the day.
Letâs not pick and choose because you know Iâm the one thatâs here to stay
and girl you keep me on my toes, illuminate the lowest lows
And baby in my heartâI know that youâre the one
Itâs thirty degrees outside and itâs starting to snow so take off your clothes baby let me keep you warm.
Take a dip in the river; donât shiver, Simone
Iâll be your secret and always keep you warm.
Take a dip in the river; donât shiver alone,
Iâll be your blanket and always keep you warm.
Iâd do anything to hold you in my arms, sweet Simone. Youâre all that I desire!
Iâd do anything to hold you in my arms, sweet Simone. Youâre all that I require!
Iâd do anything to hold you in my arms, sweet Simone.
