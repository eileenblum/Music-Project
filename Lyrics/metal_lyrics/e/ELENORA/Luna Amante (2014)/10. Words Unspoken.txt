We open on darkened horizons; young and violent, miles away
On different roads we were aimless--can you blame us?
How weâve found our way
Oh, your face is perfection--the solace that I need
The reflection of words that I could never say
We met on a course of white horses; white horses, not like today
With all of our trouble behind us--to remind us that nothingâs in our way
Escaping the past that consumed, us we found trust--a reason to be
When everything seemed to be broken, it was spoken to be our destiny
