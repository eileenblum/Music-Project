I said itâs over; donât talk to me
Because thatâs what It comes down to
And I donât want to listen to another damn word you have to say to me
(Just let go)
I think the moment you left
was the moment my life started making sense
(I've opened up my eyes--there's so much more)
I had to follow my heart--the only way to make my life feel whole again
I hope you understand that I have grown,
Being without you was hard, but I've learned to stand on my own
I hope you understand that
I have grown
I know that Iâll see you again, when we both have learned to be on our own
On our own, understand that I
Have shown you I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I wonât change
Because you make me, yeah, you make me somebody I wasn't before.
Now that youâre gone I have to face all my demons.
Why do they all remind me of you?
You matter to no one I doubt that they'll miss you.
Bear with me now; you'll know what comes next.
We are the mirror your lies will reflect, so run! Run away! Because you'll never learn from your mistakes!
It was cursed from the start; the lies were more dependable than the truth
When it all fell apart I finally found myself again
