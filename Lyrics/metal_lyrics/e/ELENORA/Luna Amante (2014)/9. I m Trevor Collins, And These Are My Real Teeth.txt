Iâm a ghost in a body I found--a cold heart, and warm skin
Once Iâm done with your body I leave
I Lock my mind in a box to get rid of the pain
...Iâm having trouble remembering your name
You can find me in a fake sleep
Addicted to this memory; addicted to the sound of your voice.
Turn your head--I canât look you in the eyes, and youâre the reason why.
Shaken, oh but how we've grown
Building houses from broken homes
Haunted, but it makes us...
The memory of that day still haunts me (still haunts me)
I believe that, someday, the sirens will fade (the sirens will fade)
For we are the children of bones--itâs all that we know (it's all that we know--itâs all that we need)
So when you find me in this slumber: donât wake me up because Iâm dreaming of you
When you find me in a deep sleep
Addicted to this memory; addicted to the sound of your voice
Turn your head--I canât look you in the eyes and youâre the reason why
HAUNTED, BUT IT MAKES US WHOLE
