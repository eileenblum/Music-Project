Finding the truth doesnât mean thereâs an answer
Who would have thought? It seems worthless.
Thereâs no end to the travesty, idiocy,
It would seem Iâve arrived at the meeting point
Between then and now, a different place
The past alive, and the future is now

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an âoutâ
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
âcause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
Weâre all gonna see, we werenât prepared

Grasping the liquid glass
Shaping my own sight
Staring at the sun
Absorbing death
Reach into the well
Where father laid his eye
