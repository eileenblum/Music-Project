Strokes from oars could be heard,
beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
we were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
the thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"
