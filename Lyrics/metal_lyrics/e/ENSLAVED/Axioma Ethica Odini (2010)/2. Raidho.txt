This journey without movement
Heading out for no-man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours, in the silence

This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads

This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I, uprooted, now the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken

This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience, cannot be shared

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

Lightless voyage, blinding speeds
Certain; I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes, enigmatic design
I know enough to endure

Lightless corridors, ageless
Familiar
Alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above

Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the Wheel
Union of stillness and change

Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath, blood, sacrifice and bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes
