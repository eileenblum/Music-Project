Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

...Black...White...Shadows...Gods

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground

No-one steals what no-one owns
Disown and distance

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No-one steals what no-one owns

One by one by one

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No need for companionship
Back into the silence
It is all it needs
Desolation

Singular - Death - Birth
Singular - Birth - Death

Alone in birth
Alone in the darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight

One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination - I
All can be reached from within

Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
