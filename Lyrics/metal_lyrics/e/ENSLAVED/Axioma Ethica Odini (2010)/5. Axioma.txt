"Mind not the worshippers of punishment,
Un-growers and resisters"

Close your eyes, sense the below
Torment and separation points ahead
Set ablaze like steel through skin

"Fear not the settlement with those who fear the truth"

Leave now, bid farewell with no grief
Their words have no power
The forces will roam and return
