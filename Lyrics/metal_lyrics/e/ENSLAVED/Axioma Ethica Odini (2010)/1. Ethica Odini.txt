Reckless man - So righteous, so clean
Towards the light - So bashful, so pure

Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light?
The light! And turn from the spinning wheel

Fear of the judgement!
Obey!

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Watch their deeds - So just and fair
Crusaders - Appointed by God

Who told you step inside and preach?
Did you forget the daggers lurking in the dark?
Couldn't you listen or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved?
Were you saved, so you could slaughter with grace?

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream

Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you
They have died for you

Drasill - Ride on
Drasill - Ride on
Ride on
Drasill
