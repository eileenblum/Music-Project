To war!
Let the havoc be revenged

March!

Against the lords of perdition

Live!
Breathe!

Persecute the ones that left to persecute your soul
Crush the scepters of the kings and come and
Hail the vows of old!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

How did I get this far?
How did it come to this?
Was my blood spilt in vain?
Did I survive, did I break the chains?
Was I ever alive?

Struggle through the wounds
Struggle through the fears
Struggle through the truths
You stand alone

Come through!
Release me!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

I walked this far myself
My blood dripped from my knife
I awoke, and was alive
I did no longer weep
I saw my beacon, I ran to aid
