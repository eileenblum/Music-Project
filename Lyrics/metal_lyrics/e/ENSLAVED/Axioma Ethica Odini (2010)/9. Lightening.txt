I crossed the borders
The pain won't go away

For this treason, I want to see them ... Burn!
Hunt them down
Make them understand
The power I possess

I'll give you piece of mind
And freedom to search inside

I'll suffer for your souls

I cleaned the air
I slew death in your way
The hand of peace
All evil's great dismay

Hear the wheels turn
See the sky burns

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I'll suffer for your needs

Don't you forget where your domain lies
Obey your slaves, with their feeble cries
We'll force you back if you linger here
We mock your strength, we see your fear
You'll never set a slave's mind free
Your bane is the grip of anxiety

At the ninth...

REID - Travel with no fear
REID - Remember to return
REID - Defy the laughing chaos
REID - Strike again

You fight the wars for your kin
You leave yourself behind
This settlement, you can't win
The inner eye is blind

I will clean the air
I know the pain will stay
I'll cross the border
I'll never fade away

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I will linger on
