No distance, no time
Endless void, absence of life
Chaos dwells outside the womb
Seduce, Invoke
Embrace, Give birth

See through the flesh
See past the soul
Feel the pulsating twilight
Domain of unborn thoughts
Go back, Unveil
Approach the cosmic womb

No smile without pain
No grief without laughter

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

Come nearer, Restless sin
Step into the core
They will welcome your return
Further in
Ride the storm one can't escape

Awake the Gods
Awake the Gods

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth
