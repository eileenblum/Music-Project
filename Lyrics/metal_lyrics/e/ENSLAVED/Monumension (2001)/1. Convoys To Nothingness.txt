Faces - eyes - noise

Floating patterns of no coherency, none needed

From behind the chapel of dreams came imagery
From another world
The left for a brighter star
A new home called "now"

Womb - death - dawn

Follow seafarers on an ocean of silence
Remaining humanoid shells, a distant thought
The chasm between truth and flesh paved
With bricks from secret cities

Entering linear orbit
Crushing the foundations of divided times
Suns reflected

Convoys...
Convoys to...
Convoys to nothingness...
