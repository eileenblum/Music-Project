I hear their poisonous words again
As they call out for submission and code
"To be less than one and drown equals pride" they say
These were the voices that destroyed us

Did I want for this loss to be sustained?

Through the clipping of wings found the secret paths
From the blinding light of lies obtained second sight
Stabbed in the back, gained strength in One-ness
Taken from me, I learned to preserve

These were the voices that sunk our ships
These are the voices - poisoned ears bleeding

Did I pray for the dead to be kept awake?
Did I gently place these thorns through the surface
of my eyes?
Did I ask for this fathomless tragedy to go on forever?

Fail to comply - reborn in war
The answer being no

Did I?
