Betrayed by disillusion
Enslaved by insanity
Enslaved by commitment to betrayal
Betrayed by all elements

My vision is clear and strong
I comfort myself to fulfil it
There exists no edge
Clearly existence is wrong

I kill myself to fulfil my vision
Consumed by astral interference
I deny this monument to be my sphere
I choke this ego to find that i'm dead
I deny this monument to be my sphere

I will die as one
