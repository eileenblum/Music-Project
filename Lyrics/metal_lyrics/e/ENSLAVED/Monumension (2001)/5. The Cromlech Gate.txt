[The fool:]
"Fear not dear kinsmen, cause you
Saviour I am. I'll bring back our glory
And wisdom Achieve I'm searching the
Old path to bring back the elder"

Smug as only the fool can be, mindless
Blindly. He marches towards his fate
Summoned by the Cromlech by hunger within

[Voice from a parallel existance:]
"Come inside my friend, your father is waiting.
Your search ends here, Wisdom you have
gained, the signs you have read."

Doomed to walk the smiths dungeons
Underworld slavery
Through the eyes of the fool nothing can be seen
The elder is hiding beyond thoughts
Only leaving with glimpses of long lost knowledge

I once saw the Cromlech and was kindly invited
But I stayed the beast I kissed the ground
(I drank the wine)
(I took up the runes)
I found the home of the elder
