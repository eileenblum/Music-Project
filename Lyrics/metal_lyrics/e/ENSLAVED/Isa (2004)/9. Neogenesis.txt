Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Distant self now cut through, approaching infinitely
Racing hearts throbbing deep beneath the painted bones
Mars opens the hidden doors to Venus
Lunar flight crashing into solar storms
Blinding unification - vertigo - ecstatic curtain fall
Get ablaze by inner arson, endlessly reborn
Winds, oh the winds that speak of your salt and blood
Break open the dam, flood the deserts

Shocking white pulsar radiant dreams drawn in night sky
Ice-glazed branches undead by rays from an impossible sun
Crystallized pathways towards runic chambers concealed within the microcosmos
Revert away from the predicament, flee across the abyss

Severing the fetal cords spawning fusions by the thousands
Through bent space created black channel - pagan relay
Sensations of flesh flickering
Praising death through bleeding eyes

Neogenesis
