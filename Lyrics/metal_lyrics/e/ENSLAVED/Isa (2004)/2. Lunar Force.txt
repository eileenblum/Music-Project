Farewell my brother
Farewell my foe
May death embrace you
Your blood in the darkness flow

You were never meant to rule
Never to light up my father's throne
May you suffer deep below
You tried to deprive (me of) my rightful crown

Fallen, defeated, tricked by Beorc,
The Lunar Force
Behold the sorcerer when you're
Impaled by the sword

Farewell my brother
Farewell my friend
May she have pity with you
We did not wish for your life to end

The day will bleak when
The Old One arrives
The King betrayed by his treacherous mind
Defeated by Beorc, The Lunar Force
