Brought here by sorrow
Raised in the depths of fear

Consuming sanity
Feasting on the joy of Man

Surrounding the trembling mind
Surrounding the troubled soul
Strength failed to tame the serpent
The offspring of laughter and sadness
Saved by the power of its kin
Obeying the whispering chaos
Pulsating underneath your skin
Feasting 'till the end of time

Denying all peace within
Fearing the freedom it never feels

Bounded by allegiance
To long gone sanity

It lurks deep below

Emerge at the last step
