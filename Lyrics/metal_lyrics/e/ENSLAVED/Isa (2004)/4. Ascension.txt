Staring across the void, seeing eye to eye in folded space
I see you with the colours and frenzy of the sacred rooms
We've met in those dreams; ice blue water ran towards the green sky
The gods spoke to us in their infancy
Suns waiting for us to smitten them with the flames of our disease
And we did so laughing, giving birth to sunrises in our wake

Never in need of sleep, nor in need of truth
I would never have stayed in this darkness, and we would ascend

The taste of ash, no stars above - No green grass below
The last words set ablaze as we saw the inner imagery
How it all came alive when we no longer reached for it
How it all rose and overwhelmed the speechless (us)

In this house without words we came to be one
In these books without text we found the way

A path along a faded memory, without the fear of finding home

We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed in this darkness
We would never have stayed
We would ascend
