A new sound heard throughout the land
From which the spirits had left ages ago
Sacrifice and honour replaced by betrayal and usurpers
A trail of sweat and blood, a gathering to the pagan
outer worlds

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

An uprising by those that claim the Supremacy of One
Against the misleaders of the blind, deceivers of the Masses
Man can no longer claim ignorance as reason for waiting
It is all for the taking, the world for their making

We will gather again
Under the leaves
We will gather again
In honour of the nine nights

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

We will gather again
To praise the courage
We will gather again
To watch the harvest
