In the radiant night
Beneath the fertile soil
In every heart it lies sleeping
Hiding in dreams of strength
Older than the mountains
So ancient and profound
Beyond the grasp of reason
Above the laws of man

The ancient gods of battle
Summoned by the drums of war
In circles of fire descended
Our eyes and minds frantic
At the point of no return
I never saw her shine so bright
Returning the strength to a weary heart
Strife to reclaim and expand

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

In times when truth has lost its valour
In times when fate is bought and sold
When honour lays slain at vanity's feet
It seemed like our last hour had come
The enemies' name outspoken
They will tremble upon seeing the sign
The second coming has no mercy
Forged in the flames with iron will

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world
