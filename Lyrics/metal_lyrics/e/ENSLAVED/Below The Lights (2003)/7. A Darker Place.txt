[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Behind the walls
Below the lights

If you came upon a door
If you came to push it open
If your eyes could see within this dark
Your heart would flee
Nails and blood
Painted by delirium
You would feel the empty stare

From a darker place

Silent screams
From ages in the void
Desperation
The voices fill your ears
Head back into the light
Never to return
This dream will haunt you

From a darker place

Behind the walls
Below the lights
