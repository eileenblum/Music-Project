[English translation:]

Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God;
He is called the Old White Norse God;
He is great and holy;
His teeth are made of gold;
His horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird;
He sees night as clear as day
One thousand miles away from where he is;
He also hears the grass grow from the soil,
Or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn,
And they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.
