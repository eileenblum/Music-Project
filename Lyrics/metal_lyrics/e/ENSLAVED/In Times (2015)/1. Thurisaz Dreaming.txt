Circling high above the earth
Drew a letter thought a spear
Forgot the yearnings
And left myself

Broken through the silk skin
That separates the times
Two eyes closed
Night is all around

I've taken on another form
Learning once again to speak
Growing forth a shadow heart
No less beautiful

A hammer not for building
But for breaking the glass
For bending the passing of days
To the deeper will

In the mind-hive
I can hear you dream
In the mind-hive
It's so quiet up here

Fractals gone
I can see your face
Fractals gone
No need to move

In the mind-hive
I can hear you dream
In the mind-hive
It's so quiet up here

Then I'll see but the one

Circling high above the earth
Drew a letter thought a spear
