The mind and the flesh
The atom space
The deity and mankind
The distant nebulae
The aeons of death and glory
All within the infantâs first breath

Onwards to life
Onwards to death
Onwards to madness
Onwards to sense

The chalice of daylight
The coiling sword
The blood of infinity
The solar eclipse
The instigation of doom
All united in timelessness

Onwards to create
Onwards to erase
Onwards to illuminate
Onwards to the bridge

Every morning as the first
Dawning marks the new battle
Each nightfall as the last
The wounds can heal of mark the end
All times in a single heartbeat
In circular disintegration

In between night and day
Lies the shrine of secrets
In between mind and chaos
Dwells the non-being

The mind and the flesh
The atom space
The deity and mankind
The solar eclipse
The instigation of doom
All united in timelessness

Onwards to life
Onwards to death
Onwards to madness
Onwards to sense
