There is no end
Around and further
Into the distance
In times found
A secret key

The feather light astral beauty
Outside the realm of thoughts
Within the reach of certain dreams
Spun from golden leaves of black holes
And ancient thread
Across the dimensional dome
Above the lone runner
A burst of all things bright
All things bright and beautiful
No more longing

In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times
In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times
In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times
In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times

The giants of the night side wade
Silently through the sea
Crossing through a singular point
Opened by runic
Penetration
Standing by the sea, I wonder
Alas, my aching heart
We have come to dissolve the shackles
So that we might live and breathe
In all our times

In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times
In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times
In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times
In the flickering of the present
Travel across the ocean of times

Become the other as yourself

All things made
Possible
All times made
Achievable

Enter as you leave it all behind
Exit through the heart
See the endless suns burning
The frost that never thaws

Rites of stillness
In
Praise transition
Times
Rites of stillness
In
Praise transition
Times

Awoken from lust less slumber
Ice from the eyes
Fire from the mind
Having found direction

In
Side the out
Side
Inside times
In
Side the out
Side
Inside times
In
Side the out
Side
Inside times
In
Side the out
Side
Inside times
