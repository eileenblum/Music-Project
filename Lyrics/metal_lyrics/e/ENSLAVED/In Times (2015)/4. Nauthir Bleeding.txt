I kept the sounds to myself
And then I saw how
I needed, how Iâd drifted
It was all in the past

I survived
The dreadful hours
I dug the grave
I climbed back out
Waited oh so long
Dreamt of us

Alone walking
Through the cemeteries
Of our buried memories
Held the stillborn heir
To naught and less
Sung her to sleep
While she gnawed at the flesh

And we're in the now
Bleak shadows in time
Echoes from the future
Frozen in the past

A funeral of ghosts

A funeral of ghosts
Dread
Frenzy
With nothing to keep us together
Gateway
Darkness
Except the need to part ways
Bindrune
Clarity
At the crooked cross at dusk
Internalize
Flight

Days â Fight â Enlighten
Harvesting â Building â Inside

I kept the sounds to myself
And then I saw how
I needed, how Iâd drifted
It was all in the past
(And we're all in the now)

Gnawing and scratching
At the roots of the self
Paving the road to ruin
Blowing out the candle
The fire within
Poisoning the lifeblood

Gnawing and scratching
At the roots of the self
