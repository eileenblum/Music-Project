[Rune-chants]

A clear voice shouted
From the bridge between the worlds
Hidden among misty peaks
A mother tongue forgotten
In a realm of dead and night
In a realm of light and day
In a place I roamed
In a void I despised
In a maze I strayed
In an ocean I drowned

The claws were scratching
On the journey to the stars
Yet not unveiling
But words were spoken

Two bright eyes stared
From behind the sun
Yet it stared through thin air
A long lost brotherhood

The shield was broken
In my dreams I awake
The reflection danced
In my centre I died
In a state of non-reality
In my astral hours
In my daylight sleep
The feathers lifted me
