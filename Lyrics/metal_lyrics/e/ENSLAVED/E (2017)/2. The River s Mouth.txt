Force open the river's mouth
Do not wait for the pour
Go push open
The fleshy eyelids
Before dawn calls upon us
Sound the golden horns
Before they scout the gates
Go home and build the temples
As cognition ignites
Speed of thought
Motion with purpose
Eyes ahead
Chasing time

Live in dreams more real
Than any days of yore
Flow, in more ways than one
Dance to the discord that be
Laugh out loud
At the truths left behind
Welcome to the place
That is not
As the flame ignites

Speed of thought
Motion with purpose
Eyes ahead
