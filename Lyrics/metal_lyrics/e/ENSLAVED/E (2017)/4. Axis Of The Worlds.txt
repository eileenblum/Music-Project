Fortresses built by idle hands
Weapons forged in the shadows
Solemn words praise the devoted and brave
Stepping on the threshold of the insane
The walls must be breached

The branches of the old tree creak
The songbird sings it's elegy
The lifetime leaves are turning pale
The serpent gnawing and spitting

Praising the high king on his golden throne
For shelter, harvest and peace
Seeking council in the halls of the tyrant
Dwelling on the doorsteps of doom
The walls must be breached

The branches of the old tree creak
The soldier swinging swords
The glare in the hearts is fading
The serpent feasts with joy

Chase the serpent
Step on his tail
Grant it eyes to behold
Grant it wings to expand
Grant it thoughts to convey
Grant it claws to destroy

EIHWAZ/EOH
Envision the sacrifice
EIHWAZ/EOH
Glance into the worlds
EIHWAZ/EOH
Let the blood heal
EIHWAZ/EOH
Let it grow, let it rot

As certain as birth and death
Grief will follow laughter and joy
The vermin will return to the lair
But the branches will never break
The walls will breach
