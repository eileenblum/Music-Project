Awaiting my death, gasping for air
The relief emerge, the mistress so fair

Don't abandon me, please grant me life
I embrace your powers, higher wisdom's wife

I've been fighting in vain, but they grew too strong
For my kinsmen this day became far too long

I lie in the open, waiting to die
Were all my life's beauty built on a lie?

My grace you shall get, because I welcome your return
(If) you're not the hidden into sadness I'll turn
I've come to your rescue now before your last breath
My love you will receive, but it will be your death

Fear not, said the mistress, the lady of light
Those who betrayed us would not stand the fright
