The question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
To leave you behind?

The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

If I told you I'd get you through
I'd have to let you fall down

Not because of malice
You needed to
And I'll remember
What we had

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain
