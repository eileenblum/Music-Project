You lie there sleeping
Growing in my mind
A voice from eternity
Awaken now and guide me

Awaken now and guide me
Awaken now and guide me

He turns inward to see
"What might lie ahead?"
Seeing all, but nowhere
"Tell us, will we see the sun again?"

"Waiting is the cost of true vengeance"

Carrying the weight of knowing
"I see darkness, I see evil times"
Time to rise and stand tall again
"The ideals of the One"
I bow to the forefathers
"Towards the Father"
Feeling the transition
"The unity of dimensions"

Leave me not before all fear is gone
Pour into my veins
Let the father become the son,
And I'll keep walking through every winter

I'll keep on walking through every winter
I'll keep on walking through every winter
