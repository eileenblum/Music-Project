Behold the great evening star
As she once again gives birth
Behold the great evening star
As she once again destroys

Behold the shining wife
Of all the howling winds
She arrives when you despair
Behold the shining wife

Beware of what the self desires
She could smile if she removed
All glory from kings

Beware of the heir of cosmic fertility
Her splendour can cut you deep
Her eyes can burn the fields.
