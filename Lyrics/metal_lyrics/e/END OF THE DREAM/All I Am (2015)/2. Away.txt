Crawl deep inside
Can you heal the scars in my mind?
Hiding from the fear of falling
I'm down on my knees
All the wanting taken from me
Save me come to me my agony
Kill me I am here come set me free

Sever the ties
Separate the hurt in our minds
Can you see the light that blinds us
Keeps us afloat
Holding tightly
Afraid to let go

Save me come to me my agony
Kill me I am here come set me free
Break me take me home
And bury me where I belong
Away from it all

All is lost
Lost in the pieces of this broken home
I can't hold on
Lead me away from this world
Where I don't belong
(I don't belong here anymore)

Save me come to me take everything
Kill me I am here come set me free
Break me take me home and bury me where I belong
Away from it all
