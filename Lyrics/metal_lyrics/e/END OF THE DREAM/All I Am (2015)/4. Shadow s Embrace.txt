Darling descend with me
You're so lost and lonely
Come to me
And I will take you away
Darling, listen to me
I'm your one, your only
Don't defy me
Let me take you away

Standing in the light
To see the shadow it creates
Walk into the dark
And wait for shadow's sweet embrace
Darling, I will wake you
Close your eyes and take you
Underneath it all
Where you come to life

Without the sin
The pain within
There is no shelter from the rain
Without belief, what
Do you see when the end is near?

Standing in the light
To see the shadow it creates
Walk into the dark
And wait for shadow's sweet embrace
Fly away with me
On the wings of eternity to carry you on
There's nothing left to fear
This is where you belong
