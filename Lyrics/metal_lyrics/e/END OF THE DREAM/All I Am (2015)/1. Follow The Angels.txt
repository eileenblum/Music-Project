Separate the life from me
It burns within my soul
Call me home and set afree
The hurt that won't let go
Forgotten
With no one to remember me
I'm frozen
Lost without a soul

Into the light
The beautiful night
I'll follow the angels tonight
Sweet sorrow inside
Take hold of my mind
I'll follow the angels tonight
Guide me to my paradise
My love for one last time
My sanctuary in the dark
Where all my fears collide

Forever
Enslaved by my uncertainty
I'm fractured
Bleeding to my core
Into the light
The beautiful night
I'll follow the angels tonight
Sweet sorrow inside
Take hold of my mind
I'll follow the angels tonight
