Look away, in the distance
Far away, somewhere calm
I can drift away in a river
Wash away my remorse
All I need
A lonely whisper
The ghost of a tear

Deep in the heart of my endless dreams
Where nothing can hurt me
I can see through the dark
There's a world undying
Nothing can hold me anymore
Go away, I'm forsaken
Cast away in this cold
Overtake like a darkness
Liberate, take my soul

Tear apart these burning oceans
They won't disappear
Deep in the heart of my endless dreams
Where nothing can hurt me
I can see through the dark
There's a world undying
Nothing can hold me anymore

Deep in the heart of my endless dreams
Where nothing can hurt me
I can see through the dark
There's a world undying
Nothing can hold me anymore
