A beautiful, sacred heart trapped in a romance
Draped in silence, she turned around and left by herself
And no one sees the tears in her eyes
And she tries so hard to keep them inside

Raindrops die crying tears drenched in her own blood
Whispering a silent prayer but it's not enough
And no one sees the scars in her mind
And no one's there to keep her alive

But all along
You've been gone
I'm drowning in the past
Your secrets haunting me forever
But all along
You've been gone
I'm drowning in the past
Your secrets haunting me forevermore
