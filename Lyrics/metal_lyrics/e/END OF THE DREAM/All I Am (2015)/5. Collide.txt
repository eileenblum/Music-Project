I remember breathing to the beat of your heart
I remember bleeding when you tore me apart
Is this all you've left of me?
Cause it breaks my heart to see

I feel our hearts collide
When you sing the words and guide me with your melody
And I feel so alive
So turn the page
Create another memory with me

Don't let go of hope
Don't let them take who you are
Keep on going, stronger
And reach for the stars
Now your song is all I need
Cause inside you're just like me

I feel our hearts collide
When you sing the words and guide me with your melody
And I feel so alive
So turn the page
Create another memory with me

We were lost together
And falling through life
With no road to follow
And no end in sight
I can still remember every dream you left behind

I feel our hearts collide
When you sing the words and guide me with your melody
And we were so alive
So turn the page
Create another memory with me
