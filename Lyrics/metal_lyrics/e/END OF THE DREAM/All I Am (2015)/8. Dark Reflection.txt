Walking through darkness
A victim in need
Praying to God for salvation

Somewhere inside me
A prisoner screams
Screams of destruction and madness

Godless collusions
Betrayal and deceit
Living the lives of the broken

In search for the answer
To cure the disease
Washing away all our misery

Thereâs no need for redemption
Our dreams are divine
To unlock our faith
We will stand in line
Weâre all lost from within but prepared for the fight
Baby try to be strong
And weâll be alright

I feel like nothing's ever real
Like I'm supposed to be someone else
Outside this dark reflection
How can I believe in me
When something's always smothering me
So violently

The deepest hearts will know their fate
As they judge what they create
And all their deepest fears fall away

A moment's obsession is almost overthrown
A reason to live and die
To reap what you have sown
To make it through
And realize you've forgotten who you are
You've lost yourself in oceans of lost memories and thoughts

We are lost for a moment
In dreams so divine
With a dream of a nightmare
In our hearts confined
We're all lost from within
But prepared for the fight
Baby try to be strong and we'll be alright
