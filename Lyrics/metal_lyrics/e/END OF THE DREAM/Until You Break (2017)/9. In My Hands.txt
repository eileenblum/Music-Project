Look me right in the eye
And you tell me it's over
There's no words left unsaid
No more hearts to be broken
Is it too late to tell you how much I hate you?
Cause I've been trying to hide it
Can't fight it, it's taken over

So escape
Run away
Cast a shadow over me

I gave you everything
All I've ever been
The world is in my hands
And there's nothing left of me
Nothing more to see
I can't make you understand
That I'll take the pain
I'll find a way
And I'll be all that I can be
I gave you everything
The world is in my hands

Keep pretending it's alright
But inside we're drowning
Took me so long to realize
You're just not worth it
Now it's too late I just wanna tear my heart out
Because I understand now
You're not who I thought you'd be

All along
It's been gone
But we keep on hanging on

I gave you everything
All I've ever been
The world is in my hands
And there's nothing left of me
Nothing more to see
I can't make you understand
That I'll take the pain
I'll find a way
And I'll be all that I can be
I gave you everything
The world is in my hands

So escape
Run away
Cast a shadow over me
Try to hide from the shame
Is this all you have to say?

I gave you everything
All I've ever been
The world is in my hands
And there's nothing left of me
Nothing more to see
I can't make you understand
I've been through it all
Rise and fall
And I've been all that I could be
And I gave you everything
The world is in my hands
