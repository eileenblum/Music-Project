The mark as our sun now forever departs
Forever engraved in the pieces of our hearts

Separated by our love in disguise
Yet we never once wished for this day to arrive

Free of falling
Free of mourning
All that I breathe
Is no more

I am nothing
I am nothing
To you

We're walking in circles and back to the start
For we have fallen apart

Free of mercy
Free of destiny
All that I breathe
Is no more

I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing
I am nothing
To you
