Yeah you're burning
Burning deep into my soul
Yeah you murder everything you can't control

Yeah you
You just can't take any more
No you
You just can't break any more

Cause I've had enough of your fixation
Tired of all your desperation
Heartless
Won't you take this spell from me

Cause I've died enough for your salvation
Prayed enough for vindication
Let me go
Release your hold on me

Erase me
I don't mind
Forgive my sins tonight
I think I've served my time
So please erase me
I don't mind

Yeah you're trying to kill everything we love
While you're promising us heavens up above

Yeah you
You just can't kill any more

Cause I've died enough for your delusion
Prayed enough for absolution
Falling down in pieces
You and I

Erase me
I don't mind
Erase my scars tonight
I think I've served my time
So please erase me
I don't mind

Erase me
I don't mind
Forgive my sins tonight
I think I've served my time
So please erase me
I don't mind
