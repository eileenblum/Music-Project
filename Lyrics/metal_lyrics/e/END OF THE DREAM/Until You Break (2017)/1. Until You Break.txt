Show to me
All of your hopes and your dreams
The deepest desire
That's burning inside of your heart

Reach too far
And burn your hands on the stars
The stronger the fire
The brighter the light in your eyes

I'll let you bleed until you break
Die before you wake
Take your heart away
Never knowing why you fight at all
Why you never fall
Why you're holding on
Until you break
Until you break

Take my heart
And crush it and break it apart
Got no more respect for you
I am rejecting your love

Take from me
All of my hopes and my dreams
And make me regret
All the trust that I had for you, love

I'll let you bleed until you break
Die before you wake
Take your heart away
Never knowing why you fight at all
Why you never fall
Why you're holding on
Until you break
Until you break

I'll let you bleed until you break
Die before you wake
Take your heart away
Never knowing why you fight at all
Why you never fall
Why you're holding on
Until you break
Until you break
Until you break
