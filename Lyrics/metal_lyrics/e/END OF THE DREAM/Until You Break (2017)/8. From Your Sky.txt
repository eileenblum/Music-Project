Show no mercy
Give the world to me
Forget the rest
They don't deserve to be
The unbelievers
They're all diseases
There's no place for me

I guess it's time to set the world on fire
Burn them all
Leave nowhere left to hide
And make them pay
Make them pay for all their evil ways

They say we'll make it okay
But who are they to destroy our freedom

So I'm watching you
Such a lonesome view
Watch the fire raining from your sky
Hypnotize

Ever wander in the dead of night
Ever searching for a place to hide
A secret place
Where all is safe
And we can fade away

They say we'll make it okay
But who are they to destroy our freedom

So I'm watching you
Such a lonesome view
Watch the fire raining from your sky
Hypnotize

So I'm watching you
Such a lonesome view
Watch the fire raining from your sky
Hypnotize

Is this all you are?
Such a tainted heart
Watch the poison spreading from within
Withering
