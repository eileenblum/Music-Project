Fall inside the deepest, darkest unknown
Let go of everything you know
Don't let them take you away

Stranded in this nothingness
I built on my own
Fighting off the enemies alone
I won't let them take me away
I won't let them take me

Wakeless
Don't take me away
Save me from drowning again
Leave me behind
I am safe inside my mind
Wakeless
Don't take me away

Long-forgotten memories
Of truth and despair
Fade into oblivion again

A world enduring cruelty
Of gods so unjust
Languishing
Crumbling each day
I won't let them take me away
I won't let them break me

Wakeless
Don't take me away
Save me from drowning again
Leave me behind
I am safe inside my mind
Wakeless
Don't take me away

Follow your own way
Let the thoughts escape
Dreaming of the day
This all fades away

Don't let them take you away
Don't let them take you

Wakeless
Don't take me away
Save me from drowning again
Leave me behind
I am safe inside my mind
Wakeless
Don't take me away
