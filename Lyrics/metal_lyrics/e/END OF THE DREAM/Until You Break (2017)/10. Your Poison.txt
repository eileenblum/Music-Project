Feed the poison in my head
Speaking words I can't forget
I am broken by your hands

You say you want
Say you want it all
But in the end
I can take no more

Never bleed for what you love
Never long for what you have
Never try to understand

You say you want
Say you want it all
But in the end
I can take no more

So kill me with your poison
Cut me with your toxic lies
Infect me with your venom
Go and leave me paralyzed

So go on and kill me
Go on and watch me die

I will be free
I won't be tainted by the hate that feeds you
I won't be abused
I will be free from all the misery you are
I won't turn back
And I'll surrender to nothing

So kill me with your poison
Cut me with your toxic lies
Infect me with your venom
Go and leave me paralyzed

So go on and kill me
Go on and watch me die
So go on and kill me
Go on and watch me die
