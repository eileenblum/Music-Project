Follow me
Into the grave
All our wrongs will soon be gone
There's not much more to say

Call to me
Teach me to fly
Away from all the loss inside
I don't know I'll survive
But here I am

Defile us
Deny us a chance to be at peace
Defile us
Deny us a reason to believe

Cross the line
The innocence inside
Let me know that I've done wrong
To trust you in your lies

Lie to me
Tell me I'm a fool
Like I'm supposed to be someone
Who can't accept the truth
Just lie to me

Defile us
Deny us a chance to be at peace
Defile us
Deny us a reason to believe
And shatter all our dreams

All the bits and pieces
Of the hearts we love to break
Haunting us forever
And they never go away

Defile us
Deny us a chance to be alive
Defile us
Deny us a hope for better times

Defile us
Divide our hearts and bury me
Defile us
Deny us a chance to be alive
And love for one last time
