It's almost overtaking me
Stuck in your endless misery
You're sinking
And I'm coming down with you

I know just what you wanna say
How I just throw my life away
I'm still breathing
And I won't bend for you

So tell me
Do you see
The secrets on the inside
I can't hide them
Deny them
Can't make them disappear

Who do you think you are
To tell me you can control my heart
And baby all that I do is wrong to you
I can't take it anymore

And who do you think you are
To tell me I don't deserve to live
That I am less than I ought to be
To be deserving of your love

You're fake
Your hate won't shatter me
I don't accept your sympathy
It's too late now to make it right again

So just save your prayers and walk away
I didn't create the world you hate
The real demons are right inside of you

So tell me
You don't see
The words you speak cut deep into me
And help me
Escape this imaginary hell

Who do you think you are
To tell me you can control my heart
And baby all that I do is wrong to you
I can't take it anymore

And who do you think you are
To tell me I don't deserve to live
That I am less than I ought to be
To be deserving of your love

Run away
Leave me stranded
Drowning in your despair
A thousand tears are falling
There's no way out
Even when I'm all alone
You're still there to take control

Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are

Who do you think you are
To tell me you can control my heart
And baby all that I do is wrong to you
I can't take it anymore

And who do you think you are
To tell me I don't deserve to live
That I am less than I ought to be
To be deserving of your love
Deserving of your love
