Broken and beaten and bruised by desire
To be the best, but why?
Barren and cold like the flame in your eyes
Defy the final night

We follow the light back home
We follow the light
Follow the light back home

All of the dreams that you thought you believed
But were never real at all
Chasing the gain and embracing the pain
To find the final fall

And if somehow the truth you seek
Is shrouded by your pain
Heed the call
And find the strength to say

I'll follow the light back home
I'll follow the light
Follow the light back home

We fall
We fall
And we fall
And we fall
