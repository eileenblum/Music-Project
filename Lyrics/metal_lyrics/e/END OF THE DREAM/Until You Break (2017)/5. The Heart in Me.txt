You love to watch me fall
Drowning in your hate so wonderful
Think you're unbreakable
Guarded by your armor of distrust
It's gone too far

You can set my soul on fire
Your broken eyes
They leave us blind
Tell me how to turn the light on
And make you see
The heart in me

You looked so real to me
Hide behind the lies I don't believe
Shrouded in mystery
An endless devotion
To make you see

You can set my soul on fire
Your broken eyes
They leave us blind
Tell me how to turn the light on
And make you see
The heart in me

You don't deserve to be the one
To save me when all my hope is gone
I rolled the dice
And paid the price
I've born your hate for far too long
And you don't deserve to be the one

You can set my soul on fire
Your broken eyes
They leave us blind
Tell me how to turn the light on
And make you see
The heart in me
