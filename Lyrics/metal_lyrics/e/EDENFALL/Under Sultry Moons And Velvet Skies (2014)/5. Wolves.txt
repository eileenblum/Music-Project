Branches with a muted pallor
Crown this void; cold and forlorn.

Songs of darkness, words of light:
Listen, and you will hear...

The children of the night
Bewitched by a full moons light,
Creating tales of grief and woe,
Singing softly; deathly groans.

Ghostly lights drenched in quietness
Reflected in a pool of nothingness.

Visions of splendour in pale moonlight:
Look and you will see...

When all is quiet and the woods are still,
They commune together like a pack of wolves.

I am the witch of the woods; an ancient wood wife.
I am the forest keeper; a she-wolf brought to life.
