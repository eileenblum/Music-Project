As cursed rain fell, my soft tears dwelt.

Listen quietly: someone's crying,
Dreams are dying, watch them fly.

Sweet, innocent child:
Where have you gone?
Poor, withering and mild:
The wyvern child.

A king's last word, my screams were heard.

Halls of ruin, wreckage and loss.
Someones bleeding; cursed yet breathing.

As cursed rain fell, my soft tears dwelt.
My screams were heard, my cold last words.
