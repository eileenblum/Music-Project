Of maiden and crone;
Bathe in snow, chill your bones.

Of sword and bough:
Stone the crows, summers gone.

The oak and pine in mourning,
Branches bare, low and weeping.

Long nights, cold dark days.
Bless us with the falling snow!

We await our death,
She brings the winter.

Of stars and smoke;
Crystal rain not mortally tamed.

Of ice and snow;
Cold winds blow, unhallowed.

The lake of tears lies frozen,
A sea of bodies drowned beneath.

The old gods are hiding, watching,
Bless us with the falling snow!

Her anger storms the skies.

As one life ends, a new begins:
The circle.

The winter comes, this is our death!
But not our end.

I've climbed mountains towards the beyond.
Oh how I've looked to find some release!

I am the winter.
