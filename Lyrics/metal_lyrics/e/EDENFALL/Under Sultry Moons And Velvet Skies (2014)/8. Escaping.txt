In her own dreams, in her own world
Seeking solitude and freedom from woe.
She finds herself, the moon is bright;
Where trees grow tall she cannot fall.

As the seasons change whispers come and go,
Sailing from the east and fading in the west.
Scattered memories lay among fallen leaves
A child with no voice, she's lost within herself!

Deep in the woods where she hides,
She's drowning in the blood that she cried.
She dies.
