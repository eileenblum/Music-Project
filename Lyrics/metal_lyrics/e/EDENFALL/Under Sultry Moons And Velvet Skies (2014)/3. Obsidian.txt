Follow the trail through the dark hills
Beneath a moon that shines like the sun:
You'll find the place where we belong.

I gaze upon the world in fear of what I've ruined!

Through fire and stone I was expelled.
I am the dark one: the obsidian queen!

Hollow are those who seek to destroy
The homes, the lives of those; the quiet.
We beg, we choose: no one will come.

I hide from the evening sun in fear of being burnt alive!

With tears of ash and songs of grief,
I am the sad one: the obsidian queen.

Witch! They call me.
Witch! They hung me.

Hold fast my soul.
