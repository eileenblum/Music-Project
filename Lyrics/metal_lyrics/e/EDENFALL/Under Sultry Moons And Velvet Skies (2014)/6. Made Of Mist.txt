Pale lights calling to me,
Speaking to my misery.
Lost in the dark and unknown:
Lead me to a perpetual home.

Deep in the dismal dark,
A faint, flickering spark.
As ghosts swim through the water,
I wade through the marshes.

Will-o'-the-wisp dancing in the dark,
Made of mist: she is the dark!

A noose chokes me, yet no ropes hang me.
I'm led in shackles, yet no chains hold me.

As night is approaching,
A blood moon is rising:
All hallows eve.

Emerging from waters,
Calm and beguiling:
Oh beautiful one!

As flesh turns to ash,
A smile to anger:
Life to death.

Ensnared by the beauty
Of a mystical night,
You walk to your demise.

I walk through the veil of dreams.

I drift away,
Dreams of death and filthy lust.
My soul decays,
Eaten by disloyal trust.

She haunts my dreams,
She walks through my soul.
