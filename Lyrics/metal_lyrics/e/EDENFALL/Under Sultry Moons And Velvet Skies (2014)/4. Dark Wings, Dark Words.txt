Laying under skies, dreaming of stars.
Sleeping with ghosts: dances with wolves.

Hold me close to devilish skin; protect me from a world of sin.
A beloved martyr, a saint and father:
Must we suffer, lost and departed?

Open wounds drag me deeper,
In these hours I'm feeling weaker.
Sinking beneath violent waters,
Waves of vengeance: my immortal.

When I awoke I couldn't see
For austere tears were blinding me.
All lost fears had risen forth
When a raven rapped at my door.

Dark wings, dark words
Lost, forgotten birds.
Black hearts, black deeds,
Cruel words: they bleed.

Falling from grace, I weep for you.
Writhing in pain, I bleed for you.

Broken, fallen, scattered.
