Sleep.

Among the rocks and roots,
Lay bones as old as time;
Resting in a deathly moot
Beneath a velvet sky.

A cairn built for kings
Holds me within the deep.
A dreams broken wing
Protects me while I sleep.

Walking through silken moors all dressed in white:
Here comes the earth mother with a wand of fiery light.

Hear me, see me,
Touch me, feel me
And rise, my deathly one.

Walking through silken moors all pale and grey:
Risen from Thistle's Cairn, a ghost from a Celtic night.
