Time is fleeting
Asleep but still breathing
We're all in keeping
With death and his thoughts.
They surround me
I'm blind, yet I still see
I glare at the unseen
This time, I must let go.

Into you, I will fall
Deeper still, I will crawl

Love is fading 
With all my daydreams
Flying, cascading
Just a momentary loss.
I lay still.
Dark clouds are coming
Closing, suffocating
What have I become?

From the weaving hands of fate,
All of the beauty must die.

Keep breathing, keep dreaming,
Don't leave me behind.
Keep breathing, keep sleeping,
Keep beauty waking.

Wretched soul of mine,
Empty shell entwined,
Mortal coil unleashed,
Septic wounds diseased.

Your misanthropy,
My lycanthropy,
Two in one combined
The death toll will climb.

As death enraptures me,
And God forsakes thee,
Lucifer comes to me,
Laughing as Jesus bleeds.

For this lost empire,
Alight my funeral pyre.
The ash and oak will burn, 
For we will never learn.

We will falter in these hours,
For we're frail and withering flowers.

In the dark I wait for her to cut the rope: my hands are tied.

I will falter in these hours,
For I'm frail and sick with patience.

Ask the witches why the cry,
All the beauty must die.

From the weaving hands of fate,
All of the beauty must die.
