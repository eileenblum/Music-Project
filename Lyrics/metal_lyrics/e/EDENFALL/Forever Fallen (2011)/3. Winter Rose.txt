Remnants of beauty; shards of dreams,
Drifting endlessly down distant streams.
She cried out with no avail;
Her tears and sorrow then set sail

Under a weeping moon, 
She cries out for her loved one.

I am the mountain; a King of old,
A snowy cell where dying flowers grow.
Look to me when skies are burning;
I am the call of constant yearning!

The rose which she seeks,
Only blooms in midwinter.

I am the ancient God of loss and despair,
Too old and proud to lend a caring hand.

"A child's life rests in my hands;
Where to turn, where to hide?
The mother will never rest,
She will always believe he's still here,
Until she finds his bones in a frostbitten tomb!"

The rose which she seeks,
Only grows on a child's grave.
