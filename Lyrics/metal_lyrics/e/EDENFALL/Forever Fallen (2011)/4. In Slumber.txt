I wander, aimlessly through this garden of stones.
A gathering of sad faces cast their gaze upon me,
With their stone cold eyes and their broken smiles,
To lead me to dismay.

Let me fade away into your distant memory.
Let me suffocate,
Please.

I'm sinking, drowning in a pool of unclear memories.
Each time I gasp for air I fall away with the tide,
For I know these depths and the enchanting darkness,
I only wish to fall.

Let me drift away into your slumbering dreams.
Let me drown.
Please.

Sometimes I glimpse a flicker of your light,
Only to be drenched in depressive night.
And sometimes I hear your sweet nothings,
Soon to be revealed as silent nothings,
In the end.

I will lie beside you in your silence struck grave.
I will die,
Here.
