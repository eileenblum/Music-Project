[Music and lyrics by Nathuruss]

The old legend says that Pentagram shall win,
Faultless gold shall corrode, the gold with Christ within,
I will be the world's ruling Goat, Christ's children will be damned,
With virgin I'll incarnate we'll conquer the holy land

1998 rise of the fettered faith,
1998 Satan no longer waits...

Abaddon's abyss' opening in the empire where Tiamat reigns,
Mankind is not as one, falsity of Jahve rains,
Time of triumph comes, Nemesis awakes in me,
For enslaving me in my crypt my true face now is seen.
